Proposed therapeutic indication 
Blincyto is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adults with CD19 positive relapsed or 
refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(ALL). Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive 
B-precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at 
least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no 
alternative treatment options.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
• 
• 
• 
• 
for the purpose of orphan designation, the COMP considered that the indication should be 
broadened to “treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia”; 
of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was 
made; 
the condition is life-threatening particularly due to the poor long-term prognosis if the disease 
relapses after systemic therapy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
Community, sufficient justification has been provided that blinatumomab may be of significant 
benefit to those affected by the condition; 
2.2.  Review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
The COMP opinion on the initial review of the orphan medicinal product designation in 2015 was based 
on the following grounds: 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 4/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
the prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 1.8 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening particularly due to the poor long-term prognosis if the disease 
relapses after systemic therapy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Blincyto may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition has been justified with clinical data showing the effectiveness in patients who are 
negative for the Philadephia gene and for whom there is no effective treatment. 
2.3.  Review of orphan medicinal product designation at the time type II 
variation  
The COMP opinion on the review of the orphan medicinal product designation at the time of type II 
variation in 2018 was based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be 1.8 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening particularly due to the poor long-term prognosis if the disease 
relapses after systemic therapy;  
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Blincyto is of significant benefit as it improves progression free survival 
and overall survival in patients with minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for 
which currently there is no authorised treatment.  
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia continues to be described in the most recent WHO Classification and 
ICD codes. ALL represents a biologically and clinically heterogeneous group of B/T-precursor-stage 
lymphoid cell malignancies arising from genetic insults that block lymphoid differentiation and drive 
aberrant cell proliferation and survival. In children, ALL is the commonest malignancy accounting for 
approximately 25 % of childhood cancer and it has 5-year event-free survival rates ranging between 
76 % and 86 % in patients receiving protocol-based therapy. In adults, ALL is less common and 
generally carries a worse prognosis with a long-term survival probability less than 35–40 % (Curr 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 5/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hematol Malig Rep (2012) 7:133–143). The condition continues to be designated by the COMP as a 
distinct medical entity. 
The CHMP approved extension to the indication (highlighted in the text below)1 falls within the scope of 
the designated orphan condition “treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia”: 
Blincyto is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome 
negative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(ALL). Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive B-precursor ALL should have failed 
treatment with at least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have no alternative 
treatment options. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
ALL is a heterogeneous disease with outcomes dependent on patient age, mutational status and co 
morbid conditions. 
Regardless of prognostic factors, the likelihood of initial remission is ≥ 95% in children and 70 to 90% 
in adults. About 75% of children and 30 to 40% of adults have continuous disease-free survival for 5 
years and appear cured. Patients with ALL refractory to induction or re-induction chemotherapy have 
poor prognosis if they do not undergo HSCT. With induction therapy, some patients achieve complete 
remission but the majority of patients relapse. The long-term event-free survival is only 30-35%. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has conducted a registry and literature search to establish the prevalence of ALL in 
Europe. Many of the registry sources date from 2012 and earlier. There were however two sources 
which were more recent, namely the UK’s Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) which 
was used by Li et al (2016) to estimate total prevalence of ALL in the UK of 1.45 per 10,000 in 2011. 
The more recent analysis of these data was published by HMRN for data collected up to 2016 and show 
a 10-year prevalence (standardized to 2013 European population) for B-lymphoblastic leukaemia of 
0.6 per 10,000 (HMRN, 2019). NORDCAN which currently provides ALL prevalence estimates for 3 
Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, and Sweden) (NORDCAN, 2019) has also been used. As of 15 
March 2019, the overall prevalence of ALL age-standardized to the World Standard Population ranged 
from 2.8 per 10,000 in Sweden to 3.5 per 10,000 in Finland. When standardized to the European 
Standard Population (NORDCAN, 2019) it ranged from 2.5 (in Sweden) to 3.2 (in Finland).  
The sponsor also provides supporting data from US National Cancer Institute’s SEER Cancer Stat Facts, 
where the total prevalence count of persons with ALL in 2015 was approximately 84,770 (SEER 2019). 
Using a population estimate for December 1, 2015 (US Census Bureau, 2019) of 321,827,267 
persons), this equates to a total prevalence proportion of approximately 2.63 cases per 10,000 
persons, which the sponsor says is consistent with prevalence estimates for ALL in Europe. 
An analysis of ECIS data was not done and although there isn’t a specific domain in ECIS for ALL the 
exercise could have shed more light on potential changes in Europe like the ones noticed in 
1 New text in bold, removed text as strikethrough

Scandinavia. Finland in particular has a high prevalence of 3.5 in 10,000, and it would be important to 
understand if there is a similar trend in other European Member States.  
It has been noted for example in the publication by Lennmyr E et al, (Eur J Haematology, 
2019;103:88-98) that the median age of patients in Sweden was 53 years and that 5-year overall 
survival in the period from 2007 to 2015 had improved; in patients 18-45yrs from 50% to 65%, 46-
65years from 25% to 46% and >65 from 7% to 11%.  
The sponsor provided older-,  as well as more recent data and concluded on a prevalence of 1.8 in 
10,000.  
The COMP requested that the sponsor provide a revised estimate for prevalence using more current 
data as there have been recent reports in the literature indicating better survival and potentially an 
increase in incidence for the period between 2007 and 2015. These revisions were submitted and 
discussed during the December COMP plenary.  
The revised prevalence estimate was compared to Rarecare data. More current estimates were derived 
from the following sources data: 
•  GLOBOCAN (country-specific data) 
•  NORCAN (data from the Nordic Countries) 
• 
• 
• 
The UK National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) 
The UK Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) 
The US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program (SEER 18, 2017 5-year 
prevalence) 
Estimated using 2018 SEER data (SEER 18, 2017 data), the proportion of leukaemia patients who had 
ALL (defined as precursor B-cell, precursor T-cell, lymphoblastic lymphoma and Burkitt’s cell 
leukaemia) was 14%. The sponsor applied the 14% to the figures from the European databases and 
provided complete prevalences which ranged from 1.98 to 2.57 per 10,000. The sponsor made a 
comparative analysis of this updated data to those reported using the Rarecare dataset and concluded 
that the reported value of 1.9 in 10,000 from the application is still relevant. They note that the 
estimate calculated from RARECARE lies slightly below the lower band of the rang provided but that it 
may be more valid, as it is based upon data collected across the EU-27. The other estimates (from 
NORDCAN) are based on data from either single countries, or the whole Nordic Region (Denmark, 
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Faroe Island, and Greenland). The COMP considered this acceptable 
as there is no conclusive evidence of the percentage of ALL patients in Europe, and therefore the 
estimate based on Rarecare could be used. 
The  COMP  noted  that  the  data  from  the  separate  registries  indicated  there  is  an  increase  in  the 
prevalence albeit difficult to establish due to regional variations and difficulty in establishing the current 
situation across Europe. The conservative approach proposed by the sponsor appeared to be warranted 
due  to  the  assumptions  made  and  the  use  of  SEER  data  in  the  calculation.  The  COMP  accepted  the 
revision  to  1.9  in  10,000  noting  that  the  additional  data  provided  would  indicate  an  increase  in  the 
prevalence thus supporting the revision. 
Following this the COMP agreed to a prevalence estimate of 1.9 in 10,000.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor has provided a list of products in their submission which primarily focuses on products 
authorised for the indication they are seeking. As the list is actually broader than this and the list 
submitted from an earlier report was used for the purpose of completeness as little has changed in the 
meantime.

The sponsor has noted the introduction of a revised ESMO Guideline for Acute Lymphoblastic 
Leukaemia in 2016 (Hoelzer S. et al).

Significant benefit 
The sponsor proposes to expand the target patient population who can be treated with Blincyto by 
including Philadephia chromosome positive B-precursor ALL patients who have failed treatment with at 
least 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and who have no alternative treatment options.  
The CHMP has agreed to this extension to Section 4.1 if the SmPC during their September 2020 
plenary. 
The data used to support this extension came from Study 20120216: A Phase 2 Single Arm, 
Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of the BiTE® Antibody Blinatumomab in Adult Subjects with 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report 
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relapsed/Refractory Philadelphia Positive B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Alcantara 
Study). 
Study 20120216 met its primary objective, showing a 35.6% best CR/CRh* rate within the first 2 
cycles of blinatumomab (null hypothesis <10%): a total of 16 patients (in FAS) presented with CR/CRh 
(35.6%; [21.9%, 51.2%]) within the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment, including 14 with CR 
(31.1%; [18.2-46.6]). It was noted that CRh would not be sufficient on its own. However, considering 
observed results, the inclusion of CRh in the primary endpoint had a limited impact on study results 
since most of responses were CR. A similar trend was noticed in PP analysis. One additional achieved a 
CR/CRh* after the first 2 cycles. Of note, a total of 40 patients are included in PP in CSR, while 41 are 
displayed in the clinical summary of efficacy. 
The ESMO ALL Guidelines (Ann Oncol (2016) 27 (suppl 5): v69-v82) mentions that: “Allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended in first remission for patients with 
Philadelphia-positive ALL. Since the introduction of TKIs, the objective response rates are similar 
between subjects with Philadelphia-negative ALL and subjects with Philadelphia-positive ALL (Thomas 
et al, 2004; Yanada and Naoe, 2006); however, duration of response and relapse-free survival (RFS) 
have remained short in ALL Phi+ patients. 
Treatment of Philadelphia-positive ALL patients who are resistant to or relapse after first-line therapy 
remains challenging.  
Recently, 2 non-TKI treatments were approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL that 
included Philadelphia-positive ALL subjects in the pivotal trials. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) is 
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell 
precursor ALL; adult patients with Philadelphia-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL 
should have failed treatment with at least 1 TKI. Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) is indicated for the 
treatment of pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell ALL that is refractory, 
in relapse post-transplant, or in second or later relapse.” 
The target patient population as defined in the proposed amendment to Section 4.1 identifies patient 
where there are no available treatments thus indicating that there is nothing requiring a direct or 
indirect comparison for the justification of significant benefit.  
As there are no satisfactory methods available for this added patient population, the COMP accepted 
that Blincyto would be of clinically relevant advantage.

4.  COMP position adopted on 3 December 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 1.9 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening particularly due to the poor long-term prognosis if the disease 
relapses after systemic therapy; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Blincyto may be of potential significant benefit in the 
treatment of patients who are double relapsed and refractory and for whom there are no further 
treatment options still holds.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Blincyto, blinatumomab, for 
treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (EU/3/09/650) is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

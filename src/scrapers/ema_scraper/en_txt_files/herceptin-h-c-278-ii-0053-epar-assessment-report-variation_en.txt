3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-derived humanised monoclonal 
antibody  that  selectively  targets  the  extracellular  domain  of  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor 
receptor 2 protein (HER-2). Trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with breast cancer 
(early and metastatic) and in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Herceptin can only be used when 
the  cancer  has  shown  to  ‘overexpress’  HER2:  this  means  that  the  cancer  produces  a  protein  called 
HER2 in large quantities on the surface of the tumour cells. Herceptin was authorised in the EU on 28th 
August 2000. The presentation granted in Europe was the 150 mg trastuzumab vial. 
The currently approved indication for Herceptin is shown below: 
Breast Cancer  
Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)  
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer:  
-  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  received  at  least  two  chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline 
and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor positive patients 
must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments.  
-  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable.  
-  in  combination  with  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not  received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.  
-  in  combination  with  an  aromatase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  postmenopausal  patients  with 
hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early Breast Cancer (EBC)  
Herceptin  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  HER2  positive  early  breast  cancer  following 
surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see section 5.1).  
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/234266/2011  
Page 3
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either  HER2  overexpression  or  HER2  gene  amplification  as  determined  by  an  accurate  and  validated 
assay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic Gastric Cancer (MGC)  
Herceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment 
of  patients  with  HER2  positive  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  stomach  or  gastro-esophageal 
junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Herceptin  should  only  be  used  in  patients  with  metastatic  gastric  cancer  whose  tumours  have  HER2 
overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ result. 
Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see Sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
In the current variation application, the MAH proposed an extension of indication to include concurrent 
use  of  Herceptin  with  chemotherapy  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with  HER2-positive  early 
breast cancer as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed 
by  combination  with  paclitaxel  or  docetaxel,  or  as  part  of  a  treatment  regimen  in  combination  with 
docetaxel and carboplatin. 
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
Adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer with Herceptin as single agent for one year was approved in 
2006  based  on  the  results  from  the  HERA  trial.  The  MAH  now  intends  to  extend  the  indication  to 
include  concurrent  use  of  Herceptin  with  chemotherapy  in  the  adjuvant  setting  based  on  the  results 
from three studies. These studies NSABP B-31, NCCTG N9831 and BCIRG006 performed independently 
by different academic study groups are described in Table 1. The MAH has provided the study report of 
the  joint  analysis  of  studies  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  (these  studies  were  submitted  as 
supportive data during the assessment of the HERA trial data), an 18-month update addendum to the 
joint  analysis,  the  study  report  of  study  BCIRG006  and  a  5-year  cardiac  safety  update  report  from 
BCIRG006.

3.3.  Clinical efficacy 
3.3.1.  Study BCIRG006 
This study was a randomized multicenter Phase III Randomized Trial conducted by the Breast Cancer 
International  Research  Group  (CIRG),    comparing  Doxorubicin  and  Cyclophosphamide  followed  by 
Docetaxel  (AC→T)  with  Doxorubicin  and  Cyclophosphamide  and  Trastuzumab  (Herceptin)  (AC→TH) 
and  with  Docetaxel,  Carboplatin,  and  Trastuzumab  (DCarbH)  in  the  Adjuvant  Treatment  of  Node-
Positive and High-Risk Node-Negative Patients with Operable Breast Cancer.  
High-risk node-negative status was defined as node-negative status with at least one of the following: 
tumour size > 2 cm, hormonal receptor status negative (estrogen receptor–negative and progesterone 
receptor–negative), histologic and/or nuclear grade 2 or 3, or age < 35 years. 
3.3.1.1. Methods

involvement assessment, or breast-conserving surgery with axillary lymph node involvement 
-  Presence  of  lymph  node–positive  or  high-risk  lymph  node–negative  disease.  Lymph  node–positive 
patients had invasive adenocarcinoma with at least one axillary lymph node showing evidence of tumor 
(pN1) of a minimum of six resected lymph nodes. High-risk lymph node–negative patients had invasive 
adenocarcinoma  with  either  1)  no  axillary  lymph  nodes  showing  evidence  of  tumor  (pN0)  of  a 
minimum of six resected lymph nodes or 2) a negative sentinel node biopsy (pN0); and at least one of 
the following factors: tumor size >2 cm, negative ER and PR status, histologic and/or nuclear grade of

Treatments 
There were three treatment arms: 
AC→T  Arm:  Every 3 weeks for four cycles, patients in the AC→T arm received 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin 
as a 5- to 15-minute intravenous (IV) bolus injection followed by 600 mg/m2 IV cyclophosphamide as 
a  5-  to  60-minute  IV  bolus  injection.  Beginning  3  weeks  after  the  last  cycle  of  AC,  patients  received 
100 mg/m2 docetaxel as a 1-hour IV infusion every 3 weeks for four cycles. 
AC→TH  Arm:  Every  3  weeks  for  four  cycles,  patients  in  the  AC→TH  arm  received  60  mg/m2 
doxorubicin as a 5- to 15-minute IV bolus injection followed by 600 mg/m2 IV cyclophosphamide as a 
5-  to  60-minute  IV  bolus  injection.  Three  weeks  after  the  last  treatment  with  AC  (i.e.,  on  Day  1  of 
Cycle 5), a 4-mg/kg Herceptin loading dose was administered as a 90-minute IV infusion. Beginning on 
Day  8  of  Cycle  5,  2  mg/kg  Herceptin  was  administered  as  a  30-minute  IV  infusion  every  week. 
Docetaxel  100  mg/m2  was  administered  as  a  1-hour  IV  infusion  every  3  weeks  for  four  cycles, 
beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 5 and then on Day 1 of all subsequent cycles. Beginning 3 weeks after the 
last treatment with docetaxel, 6 mg/kg Herceptin was administered as a 30-minute IV infusion every 3 
weeks. Herceptin treatment was to continue for 1 year from the date of first administration, regardless 
of the number of doses received or missed. For days on which docetaxel and Herceptin were both due 
to be administered, docetaxel was administered first. 
DCarbH  Arm:  The doses of docetaxel and carboplatin in the DCarbH arm are based on those used in 
this previous study, BCIRG 102.  Herceptin was given intravenously at a dose of 4 mg/kg load followed 
by  2  mg/kg  weekly  during  chemotherapy.  After  completion  of  chemotherapy,  Herceptin  was 
administered at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. This 3 weekly dosing regimen was also used in the 
adjuvant setting in the HERA study. 
The  DCarbH  regimen  was  modified  so  that  the  platinum  salt was  limited  to  carboplatin  (i.e.,  cisplatin 
was no longer allowed), based on updated results from the BCIRG 101 and 102 studies.  At that time 
(April 2002) 28 patients were already treated with cisplatinum. 
Dose modifications: 
In  case  of  severe  toxicity,  chemotherapy  discontinuation,  dose  reductions,  or  dosing  delays  were 
planned for each of the treatment arms. No dose reductions were planned for Herceptin. For patients 
who experienced Herceptin-related Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities other than those related to 
cardiac dysfunction, Herceptin was to be held until recovery to Grade 1 or 2. If recovery to Grade 1 or 
2  did  not  occur,  continuation  of  Herceptin  was  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  investigator.  If  the  same 
Grade  3  or  4  non-hematologic  toxicity  recurred,  Herceptin  was  permanently  discontinued.  Herceptin 
was not to be held for hematologic toxicity. Dose modification for cardiac toxicity was not allowed. 
Objectives 
Primary  Objective:  To  compare  disease-free  survival  after  treatment  with  doxorubicin  and 
cyclophosphamide  followed  by  docetaxel  (Taxotere)  (AC→T)  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide 
followed  by  docetaxel  and  trastuzumab  (Herceptin)  (AC→TH)  and  with  docetaxel  in  combination  with 
carboplatin  and  Herceptin  (DCarbH)  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  node  positive  and  high  risk  node 
negative patients with operable breast cancer containing the HER2 alteration. 
Secondary Objectives: 
- To compare overall survival between the 3 above mentioned arms. 
- To compare cardiac toxicity between the 3 above mentioned arms. 
- To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 3 above mentioned arms. 
- To evaluate pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy in these patient groups. 
- In addition, an independent socio-economic study will be conducted in parallel with the clinical study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was DFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of local, regional or distant relapse, date of second primary cancer and death from any cause, 
whichever occurred first. Relapse was defined as any clinical or radiologic evidence of tumor 
recurrence. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/234266/2011  
Page 7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary efficacy outcome measure was OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization 
to the date of death from any cause or last contact. Other secondary outcome measures were related 
to  quality  of  life  and  evaluation  of  pathologic  and  molecular  markers  for  predicting  efficacy  (data  not 
shown). 
Sample size 
The initial sample size calculation was based on a 5 year DFS rate of 55% in patients receiving AC→T, 
a clinically relevant improvement of 5 years DFS to be detected of 7%,  = 0.017 (2-sided) for each of 
the  planned  3  pair  wise  comparisons  and  80%  power.  Based  on  these  assumptions  it  was  calculated 
that  a  total  of  1308  DFS  events  had  to  be  observed,  translating  to  1050  subjects  per  treatment  arm 
(i.e.  a  total  of  3150  subjects).  It  was  planned  to  perform  one  interim  analysis  when  654  DFS  events 
would have been observed (applying a Haybittle-Peto error spending function). 
When the results of the BCIRG001 study became available the IDCM and the steering committee of the 
study  proposed  a  modification  of  the  assumptions  for  sample  size  consideration  (taking  into  account 
the BCIRG001 data indicating a presumed 5-year DFS of 70% in the AC→T arm) as well as additional 
interim analyses when 300, 450, and  650 DFS events had been observed (error spending function of 
O’Brien and Fleming type was to be used with overall significance levels of 0.0002, 0.0030, and 0.0111, 
respectively, for the interim analyses). The overall significance level for the main analysis was 0.0461. 
Furthermore, the testing strategy was modified in order to gain more power. It was calculated that 900 
DFS events were to be observed at the final analysis in order to achieve 80% power. 
In addition, instead of the initially planned Bonferroni adjustment a “step-down” testing procedure was 
used  to  account  for  the  3  pair  wise  intergroup  comparisons.  Each  of  the  2  Herceptin  arms  was  to  be 
compared  to  the  AC→T  arm  at  the  /2  level.  If  both  comparisons  were  statistically  significant,  the 
comparison between the two Herceptin-containing regimens could be conducted at the  level. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised to one of the three treatment arms. A minimisation algorithm balancing for 
center,  number  of  axillary  lymph  nodes  involved  (0,  1–3,  or  ≥  4)  and  hormonal  receptor  status  (ER 
and/or PR positive vs. negative) was used for treatment allocation. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  ITT  population  according  to  the  randomised  treatment 
assignment. Time to event endpoints were compared by means for a log-rank test, the impact of pre-
specified  covariates  was  assessed  by  means  of  COX  regression.  For  DFS  and  OS  respectively  the 
results of log-rank tests stratified for nodal status and hormone receptor status was applied. Observed 
treatment  effects  were  described  by  means  of  95%  confidence  intervals.  Specific  measures  (see 
sample  size  section)  were  planned  to  account  for  the  multiplicity  issues  arising  from  the  interim 
analyses and multiple group comparisons. 
To  assess  the  homogeneity  of  treatment  effects,  subgroup  analyses  were  planned  for  important 
subgroups  (e.g.  nodal  status,  age,  number  of  positive  lymph  nodes).  Furthermore,  additional 
sensitivity  analyses  (e.g.  applying  an  alternative  definition  of  DFS  endpoint  or  assessing  time  to  first 
distant disease recurrence) were planned to assess the robustness of study results.

Results 
The primary efficacy analysis is based upon data from the second interim analysis, which included 474 
DFS  events:  195  in  the  AC→T  arm,  134  in  the  AC→TH  arm,  and  145  in  the  DCarbH  arm  and 
corresponding to a median duration of follow-up of 36 months (Kaplan-Meier estimates). The results of 
this 2nd interim analysis (data cut-off 01 November 2006) are reported below. 
Participant Flow 
A summary of the patient populations is shown in Table 2. 
Table 2. Patient Populations 
Per protocol, crossover was not allowed; however, a total of 18 patients from the control arm crossed 
over and received Herceptin. 
Recruitment 
Enrollment  started  in  March  2001  and  stopped  in  March  2004.  A  total  of  3222  patients  were  entered 
into the study. At the time of study report, the study was still ongoing. 
In  the  all  randomized  patient  population,  median  duration  of  follow-up  was  2.9  years  in  the  AC→T  
(range: 0.0–5.2 years) arm, 3.0 years in both the AC→TH (range: 0.1–5.3 years) and DCarbH (range: 
0.0–5.1 years) arms.

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted by oncologist investigators in 43 countries. A total of 433 sites recruited the 
3222  enrolled  patients.  The  number  of  centres  by  country  ranged  from  one  centre  (Bosnia,  Cyprus, 
Greece, Sweden, and Switzerland) to 177 centres (United States). The number of patients by country 
ranged  from  two  to  990.  The  largest  enrolling  countries  were  the  United  States  (=  990;  30.7%), 
Germany (n = 313; 9.7%), Australia (n = 293; 9.1%) and Poland (n = 260; 8.1%). 
Subsequent  to  study  initiation,  the  protocol  was  amended  to  clarify  study  conduct,  amend  the 
statistical considerations, and report changes to the administrative structure. In total, there were four 
protocol amendments. 
Baseline data 
Baseline  characteristics  for  the  stratification  factors  used  (center,  number  of  positive  lymph  nodes, 
hormonal receptor status) are shown in Table 3:

Positive  HER2  status  by  FISH  performed  at  the  central  laboratory  was  mandatory  at  the  time  of 
enrolment. A total of 99.6% of patients (3209 of 3222) were HER2-positive. 
All  patients  underwent  primary  surgery  for  breast  cancer  prior  to  study  enrolment  and  treatment 
randomization.  Infiltrating  ductal  carcinoma  was  the  most  common  histopathologic  type  in  all 
treatment arms (> 90 % of patients). Most tumours were poorly differentiated and were excised with 
clear  margins.    The  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  the  type  of  primary  breast 
cancer surgery and other tumour characteristics. 
Furthermore, the mean age of patients was 48.8 years for the AC→T arm (range, 23–74 years), 48.7 
years  for  the  AC→TH  arm  (range,  22–74  years),  and  48.6  years  for  the  DCarbH  arm  (range,  23–73 
years). The median weight was 66.0 kg for the AC->T arm, 68.0 kg for the AC→TH arm, and 66.4 kg 
for the DCarbH arm. Karnofsky performance status was 100% for 79.8% of patients in the AC→T arm, 
for 79.4% of patients in the AC→TH arm, and for 80.2% of patients in the DCarbH arm. 
No notable differences in non-cardiac medical history were observed across the three treatment arms. 
Of  note,  ongoing  hypertension  at  baseline  was  observed  for  16.2%  of  patients  in  the  AC→T  arm, 
16.7% of patients in the AC→TH arm, and 17.7% of patients in the DCarbH arm. Similarly, 12.9% of 
patients in the AC→T arm, 14.1% of patients in the AC→TH arm, and 14.8% of patients in the DCarbH 
arm reported prior use of a cardiovascular medication. 
Likewise, no notable differences are observed with regard to hormonal therapies, also broken down by 
menopausal status.  
Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (i.e., all inclusion of all 
randomized  patients,  analyzed  according  to  their  randomized  treatment  assignment).  For  a  summary 
of the patient populations see Table 2. 
All safety analyses included patients who received any amount of study treatment according to actual 
treatment  regimen  received.  With  a  few  exceptions,  patients  followed  their  allocated  treatment 
assignment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint (DFS)  
The primary efficacy analysis is based upon data from the second interim analysis, which included 474 
DFS  events:  195  in  the  AC→T  arm,  134  in  the  AC→TH  arm,  and  145  in  the  DCarbH  arm  and 
corresponding to a median duration of follow-up of 36 months (Kaplan-Meier estimates).  
A summary of DFS events is presented in Table 43.

Table 4. Disease-Free Survival (All Randomised Subjects) 
The HR for a first event for the AC→TH arm relative to the AC→T arm was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.77; 
p<0.0001). The HR for a first event for the DCarbH arm relative to the AC→T arm was 0.67 (95% CI: 
0.54, 0.83; p<0.0003). 
Most DFS events were distant relapses occurring as multiple liver, bone, and lung lesions. There was a 
reduction  in  the  number  of  distant  relapses  in  both  Herceptin-containing  arms  relative  to  the  AC->T 
arm with the exception of distant metastases to the central nervous system. 
Very  few  deaths  (AC→T:  5;  AC→TH:  5;  and  DCarbH:  7)  occurred  without  a  prior  relapse  or  second 
primary cancer. 
A Kaplan-Meier plot for DFS is shown in Figure 1.

Secondary Endpoint: Overall Survival (OS) 
At  the  time  of  the  second  interim  analysis,  deaths  had  been  reported  for  185  patients.  Of  these 
patients, 80 were in the AC→T arm, 49 were in the AC→TH arm, and 56 were in the DCarbH arm.  
There  was  an  increase  in  duration  of  OS  among  patients  in  each  of  the  Herceptin-containing  arms 
compared  with  the  AC→T  arm  (see  Table  5  and  Figure  2).  The  hazard  ratio  of  0.58  (95%-CI:  [0.40, 
0.83), p = 0.0024) indicates a 42% risk reduction in the AC→TH arm.

Disease free survival by nodal status and other clinically important baseline characteristics 
Of  the  3222  randomized  patients,  922  (28.6%)  were  classified  as  being  high-risk  node-negative. 
Among  all  randomized  node-negative  patients,  there  was  a  64%  risk  reduction  (HR=  0.36  ;95%  CI: 
0.19, 0.68; p <0.0010)  for a first event for the AC->TH arm relative to the AC->T arm compared to a  
33% risk reduction (HR=0.67;  95% CI: 0.53, 0.85; p <0.0008), among all randomized node-positive 
patients.  Similarly,  among  all  randomized  node-negative  patients,  there  was  a  48%  (HR=0.52;  95%

arm  compared  to  a    30%  (HR=  0.70;  95%  CI:  0.56,  0.89;  p  <0.0029)  risk  reduction,  among  all 
randomized node-positive patients. The Kaplan-Meier plots for node negative and positive patients are 
shown in Figure 3.

Additional analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint benefit (DFS) in all clinically important subgroups, 
including those defined by age, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, nodal status, tumor size, 
tumor  histopathology,  nuclear  grade,  and  surgery  or  radiation  therapy,  were  consistent  with  the 
treatment  effect  in  the  overall  population  (see  Table  6).  There  was  no  indication  that  trastuzumab  is 
not  effective  in  one  of  the  specified  subgroups.  Furthermore  analyses  looking  at  the  different  events 
contributing to DFS are shown in Table 6.

bStratified log-rank p-value 
In study BCIRG 006, 213/1075 patients in the DCarbH (TCH) arm , 221/1074 patients in the AC→DH 
(AC→TH)  arm,  and  217/1073  in  the  AC→D  (AC→T)  arm  had  a  Karnofsky  performance  status  ≤90 
(either  80  or  90).  No  disease-free  survival  (DFS)  benefit  was  noticed  in  this  subgroup  of  patients 
(hazard  ratio  =  1.16,  95%  CI  [0.73,  1.83]  for  DCarbH  (TCH)  vs  AC→D  (AC→T);  hazard  ratio  0.97, 
95% CI [0.60, 1.55] for ACDH (ACTH) vs ACD). 
In  addition, data  comparing  the  efficacy  of  concurrent  trastuzumab  treatment  (AC→PH)  to  sequential 
trastuzumab  treatment  (AC→P→H)  from  the  NCCTG N9831  study  (alone)  were  presented.  The  data 
cut-off  for  this  analysis  was  November  3,  2009.  At  this  time,  50%  of  the  planned  number  of  DFS 
events  required  for  the  final  analysis  of  the  NCCTG  N9831  study  itself  had  occurred  (312  actual 
events).  A total of 1903 patients were included (patients who had been randomized to AC→T→H when 
arm  AC→T+H  was  temporarily  closed  were  excluded).    The  median  follow-up  duration  was  5.3 years 
and 75% of patients had been followed for 5 years. 
After  5  years,  84.2%  of  patients  in  the  concurrent  arm  (ACT+H)  had  not  experienced  a  DFS  event 
compared to 79.8% of patients in the sequential arm (ACTH).  There was a 25% reduction in the 
risk  of  a  DFS  event  when  trastuzumab  was  administered  concurrently  with  paclitaxel  as  opposed  to 
sequential  administration  after  paclitaxel  (unadjusted  HR = 0.77  [0.61;  0.96];  log-rank  p = 0.019).  
However,  the  boundary  for  statistical  significance  had  been  preset  at  p = 0.00116  and  so  this  result 
was  not  statistically  significant  but  was  considered  a  strong  trend  (see  Figure  4).    After  adjusting  for 
tumour size, number of positive nodes, and ER, the HR was 0.75 [0.60-0.94)].

Expressing Or Amplified Node Positive Or High-Risk Node Negative Breast Cancer 
3.3.2.1. 
METHODS 
Study Participants 
Study B-31 enrolled women with HER2-positive, early-stage, node-positive breast cancer. Study N9831 
enrolled women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high risk of recurrence.  
Key inclusion criteria for both trials were: 
-  Pathologic  diagnosis  of  adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast  with  strongly  positive  (3  +)  HER2  protein 
overexpression  by  immunohistochemistry  or  HER2  gene  amplification  by  fluorescence  in  situ 
hybridization 
-  Histologically  confirmed  node-positive  disease  or  (Study  N9831  only  following  the  May  2003 
amendment)  high-risk  node-negative  disease  (defined  as  tumor  size  >  1  cm  and  estrogen  receptor 
[ER] and  progesterone receptor [PR]  negative, or tumor size > 2 cm regardless of hormone receptor 
status) 
- Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal for the local 
radiologic facility 
-  Complete  resection  of  the  primary  breast  tumor  and  axillary  nodal  dissection  (sentinel  node  biopsy 
alone, if negative, was allowed on Study N9831)

- ≤ 84 days (12 weeks) between surgery and randomization 
Treatments 
The treatment regimens in both studies were as follows: 
All  patients  received  four  3-week  cycles  of  AC  chemotherapy  followed  by  paclitaxel  for  12  weeks. 
Patients  randomized  to  Arm  2  of  Study  B-31  or  Arm  C  of  Study  N9831  began  Herceptin  therapy 
concurrently with paclitaxel. The total duration of Herceptin therapy was 52 weeks. 
Patients in Study B-31, received four cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2 IV push, 
concurrently with IV cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes. After completion of these four 
cycles, patients received paclitaxel IV for four cycles (3 weeks per cycle) at 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours, 
or  weekly  for  12  weeks  at  80  mg/m2  over  1  hour  (weekly  administration  of  paclitaxel  was  allowed 
following  a  protocol  amendment  in  May  2003;  investigators  chose  the  paclitaxel  regimen  at 
randomization). 
Patients in Study N9831 received four cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2 IV push, 
concurrently  with  IV  cyclophosphamide  at  600  mg/m2  over  20–30  minutes  (the  latter  was 
administered  with  250  mL  of  normal  saline).  After  completion  of  these  four  cycles,  patients  received 
paclitaxel IV weekly for 12 weeks at 80 mg/m2 (with 250 mL or D5W or normal saline) over 1 hour. 
Herceptin  was  administered  weekly  as  an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion.  The  initial  (loading)  dose  was  4 
mg/kg; subsequent weekly doses were 2 mg/kg. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
 
To evaluate the efficacy of weekly Herceptin plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as 
adjuvant  therapy  for  women  with  early-stage,  HER2-positive  breast  cancer,  as  measured  by 
disease-free survival (DFS).  
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/234266/2011  
Page 18
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  evaluate  the  safety  of  Herceptin  plus  chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone,  as 
evidenced by the incidence and severity of cardiac and non-cardiac events 
Secondary objective: 
 
To determine the efficacy of weekly Herceptin plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone 
as adjuvant therapy for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer, as measured by 
overall survival 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  the  analysis  was  disease-free  survival  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomization  until  the  first  occurrence  of  any  of  the  following  events:  local,  regional,  or  distant 
recurrence  of  breast  cancer;  development  of  a  contralateral  breast  cancer  or  other  second  primary 
cancer (other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ 
of  the  cervix,  or  lobular  carcinoma  in  situ  of  the  breast);  or  death  from  any  cause.  DFS  for  patients 
who  were  not  known  to  have  experienced  any  of  these  events  was  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last 
available follow-up assessment. 
An annual history and physical examination (including pelvic examinations and annual mammography) 
were required in each protocol. Other evaluations, such as a bone scan, were done if clinically indicated 
to  rule  out  disease  progression.  Patients  who  were  felt  to  have  signs  or  symptoms  of  disease 
progression at any time during treatment were evaluated with appropriate radiographic tests (chest X-
ray, computed tomography [CT] scan, etc). All patients who had evidence of disease progression were 
contacted at least annually for survival status. 
Other  efficacy  endpoints  included  time  to  first  distant  recurrence,  time  to  central  nervous  system 
metastases, and additional exploratory analysis. 
For  study  BCIRG  006,  subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  assess  the  robustness  of 
the  primary  efficacy  results.    These  included  sensitivity  analyses  in  which  the  definition  of  DFS  was 
changed by excluding certain sub-categories from the endpoint eg excluding second primary cancers, 
non-breast cancer second primary cancers, or distant recurrences.  For each of these endpoints, time 
to event was the time from randomization to the occurrence of the event, irrespective of all intervening 
events. 
Sample size 
The sample size of the joint analysis including patients from Arms 1 and 2 of Study B-31 and patients 
from Arms A and C of Study N9831 was calculated in order to detect a 21.6% reduction in DFS events 
with  about  90%  power  in  a  log-rank  test  applying  a  significance  level  of  0.025  (one-sided).  These 
assumptions resulted in 710 events to be observed. 
The  first  interim  analysis  of  the  combined  data  set  was  planned  when  (overall)  a  total  of  355  DFS 
events had been observed; subsequent interim analyses were to be presented semi-annually. The trial 
could  be  stopped  at  any  interim  analysis  in  case  the  null-hypothesis  of  no  treatment  difference  was 
rejected  at  a  nominal  one-sided  0.0005  level.  In  case  the  trial  stopped  not  at  one  of  the  interim 
analyses,  the  final  significance  level  had  to  be  calculated  using  a  method  of  -spending  to  ensure  a 
global  of 0.025 (one-sided). 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation in both trials was done by means of dynamic randomisation. Stratification factors 
for study B-31 where: number of positive nodes, planned hormonal therapy, surgery/radiation therapy, 
institution  and  intended  frequency  of  paclitaxel  application.  Balancing  was  based  on  the  variance 
method  as  described  by  White  and  Freedman  (1978).  In  study  N9831  a  dynamic  randomization 
scheme  according  Pocock  and  Simon  (1975)  stratifying  for  cooperative  group,  nodal  status,  and 
receptor status was applied.

Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were open label trials. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  ITT  population  according  to  the  randomised  treatment 
assignment. All patients from study B-31 were included. From study N9831 patients from arms A and 
C were included. To account for a temporary suspension of enrolment in Arm C of Study N9831, only 
patients in arm A who were enrolled concurrently with arm C were included. 
Time  to  event  endpoints  were  compared  by  means  of  a  log-rank  test,  the  impact  of  pre-specified 
covariates was assessed by means of COX regression. For DFS and OS respectively the analyses were 
stratified for study (B-31, N9831), intended paclitaxel schedule (weekly, every 3 weeks), pathological 
nodal  status  (0,  1-3,  4-9,  10+  positive  nodes)  and  hormone  receptor  status  (ER-positive  and/or  PR-
positive,  ER-negative  and  PR-negative).  In  addition  the  results  of  an  unstratified  log-rank  test  were 
also provided. In case a statistical significant difference was observed for DFS a supportive OS analysis 
had  to  be  performed.  To  control  the  Type  I  error  at    =  0.025  (one-sided)  an  O’Brien-Fleming  error 
spending  function  (with  710  deaths=100%  information)  was  be  applied.  Observed  treatment  effects 
were  described  by  means  of  95%  confidence  intervals.  Specific  measures  (outlined  below)  were 
planned  to  account  for  the  multiplicity  issues  arising  from  the  interim  analyses  and  multiple  group 
comparisons. 
To assess the homogeneity of treatment effects, several subgroup analyses were pre-planned (e.g. age, 
race, performance status, pathologic node positive, pathologic tumor size etc). Various analyses were 
planned to assess the poolability of patients from both trial with regard to DFS and OS respectively.  
The  first  interim  analysis  of  the  combined  data  set  was  planned  when  (overall)  a  total  of  355  DFS 
events had been observed; subsequent interim analyses were to be presented semi-annually. The trial 
could  be  stopped  at  any  interim  analysis  in  case  the  null-hypothesis  of  no  treatment  difference  was 
rejected  at  a  nominal  one-sided  0.0005  level.  In  case  the  trial  stopped  not  at  one  of  the  interim 
analyses,  the  final  significance  level  had  to  be  calculated  using  a  method  of  -spending  to  ensure  a 
global  of 0.025 (one-sided).

Conduct of the study 
As of March 2005, clinical cut off date for the CSR, there were 10 amendments for study B-31 and 15 
for  N9831.  The  amendments  were  largely  refinements  of  the  original  protocol  and  improved  the 
definition  of  the  patient  population  (e.g.  HER2  central  confirmation)  and  the  safety  of  patients  (e.g. 
exclusion criteria for cardiac disease). The most substantial amendment was the decision to close the 
study at interim analysis and offer all patients Herceptin treatment. 
Baseline data 
Patients  were  mainly  enrolled  in  the  United  States.  There  were  no  notable  imbalances  between 
treatment  arms  for  any  of  the  demographic  characteristics.  The  mean  age  of  women  in  the  Joint 
Efficacy Population was 49.3 years for the chemotherapy alone arm and 49.6 years for the Herceptin + 
chemotherapy arm. The two most frequently occurring racial groups for the chemotherapy alone arm 
and  the  Herceptin  +  chemotherapy  arm  were  Black  (7.3%  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm;  7.2%  in 
the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm) and White (83.7% in the chemotherapy alone arm; 83.4% in the 
Herceptin + chemotherapy arm). The median weight was 72.0 kg for the chemotherapy alone arm and 
70.8 kg for the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm. ECOG status in Study B-31 was 0 for 92% of patients 
in the chemotherapy alone arm and 94% of the patients in the Herceptin + chemotherapy arm; ECOG 
status was not collected in Study N9831. 
A  total  of  61.7%  of  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  62.4%  in  the  Herceptin  + 
chemotherapy arm had a mastectomy. Nodal involvement was similar in the two treatment arms, with 
6.1%  and  5.3%  of  patients  having  0  nodes  involved  and  14.2%  and  13.7%  of  patients  having  10  + 
nodes  involved  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  and  Herceptin  +  chemotherapy  arms,  respectively.  Only 
Study  N9831  allowed  enrolment  of  node-negative  patients.  The  majority  of  women  were  ER-positive 
and/or  PR-positive:  55.9%  for  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  55.3%  for  the  Herceptin  + 
chemotherapy arm. 
Populations were generally well balanced. A slight overrepresentation of tumors > 2 cm is noted in the 
Herceptin  group  (58.9%  vs.  62%).  Compared  to  the  HERA  trial  this  patient  population  is  more 
homogenous as a defined chemotherapy protocol including doxorubicin and paclitaxel was mandatory. 
Compared to HERA there are more patients with node positive disease which is generally regarded as 
being associated with worse prognosis. 
11 patients assigned to AC->T and 4 patients assigned to AC->T+H were recorded as HER2 negative in 
the joint efficacy population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint DFS of the joint analysis at the time of the interim analysis is shown in  
Table 7 and Figure 2. The p-value for the hazard ratio crossed the pre-specified early-reporting 
boundary of 0.001 (nominal 0.0005 one-sided) for DFS. As a result, the DMCs of both cooperative 
groups independently recommended closing the studies to accrual and offering Herceptin to eligible 
patients in the chemotherapy alone arms. 
This  first  interim  analysis,  which  was  planned  to  take  place  after  355  DFS  events  had  been  reported 
(i.e.  50%  of  the  total),  was  conducted  in  April  2005  (median  follow-up:  1.8-2.0  years;  data  cut-off 
March 15, 2005).  At this time, 394 events had been actually reported.

Updated results from the addendum confirm the results observed at interim analysis. 
An  updated  joint  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  when  all  patients  had  had  at  least  18 months  of 
follow-up  from  the  initiation  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  (median  follow-up  > 3  years  for  the  joint 
efficacy  population  and  > 3.5 years  for  the  joint  safety  population).  At  this  time,  747 patients  had 
experienced a DFS event: 475 in the AC→P arm and 272 in the AC→PH arm. Results in DFS confirmed 
the results observed at the interim analysis. 
Secondary endpoint 
Overall  survival  was  the  secondary  endpoint  for  the  joint  analysis  (see  Table  8  and  Figure  3).  The 
O’Brien-Fleming  α-spending  function  was  used  to  control  the  type  I  error.  With  approximately  22% 
information  (154  deaths,  and  100%  information  occurring  at  710  deaths  for  the  final  analysis),  the 
formal boundary for statistical significance for overall survival at this interim analysis was 1.5 x 10-6.

time,  350 deaths  had  occurred  (211  in  the  AC→P  arm,  139  in  the  AC→PH  arm)  and  the  median 
duration of follow-up for efficacy was 3.5 years in the AC→P arm and 3.8 years in the AC→PH arm.

An updated joint analysis of studies NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 (submitted as an addendum) in 
which all patients had at least 18 months of follow-up from the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy 
(median duration of follow-up > 3 years) confirmed the efficacy results of the first interim joint 
analysis. 
3.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  joint  analysis  of  B-31  and  N9831  has  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  adjuvant  Herceptin  following 
the adjuvant chemotherapy combination of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel. Efficacy has 
also been demonstrated for the combination of Herceptin, carboplatin and docetaxel as administered in 
the third arm of the BIRG006 trial as well as the in combination with docetaxel following administration 
of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. A statistically significant and substantial increase in DFS and OS 
was achieved with the concurrent addition of 52 weeks of trastuzumab to taxanes (either weekly or 3-
weekly paclitaxel or 3-weekly docetaxel) following doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide. . 
In the joint analysis of the NCCTG 9831 and NSABP B-31 trials, the addition of Herceptin to paclitaxel 
chemotherapy  resulted  in  a  52%  decrease  in  the  risk  of  disease  recurrence  (primary  endpoint,  DFS). 
The  hazard  ratio  translates  into  an  absolute  benefit,  in  terms  of  3-year  disease-free  survival  rate 
estimates of 11.8 percentage points (87.2 % vs 75.4 %) in favour of the AC→PH (Herceptin) arm. At 
the  time  of  a  safety  update  after  a  median  of  3.5-3.8  years  follow  up,  an  analysis  of DFS  reconfirms 
the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  shown  in  the  definitive  analysis  of  DFS.  Despite  the  cross-over  to 
Herceptin  in  the  control  arm,  the  addition  of  Herceptin  to  paclitaxel  chemotherapy  resulted  in  a  52% 
decrease  in  the  risk  of  disease  recurrence.  The  addition  of  Herceptin  to  paclitaxel  chemotherapy  also 
resulted in a 37% decrease in the risk of death. 
In the BCIRG 006 study for the primary endpoint, DFS, the hazard ratio translates into an absolute 
benefit, in terms of 3-year disease-free survival rate estimates of 5.8 percentage points (86.7 % vs 
80.9 %) in favour of the AC→DH (Herceptin) arm and 4.6 percentage points (85.5 % vs 80.9 %) in 
favour of the DCarbH (Herceptin) arm compared to AC→D. 
The  median  follow-up  duration  of  more  than  5-years  in  study  BCIRG  006  has  shown  that  the 
combination  of  trastuzumab  with  chemotherapy  is  more  effective  than  delaying  trastuzumab  therapy 
by  3  months  after  the  completion  of  the  whole  chemotherapy.  5-year  DFS  was  increased  from  80% 
with ACTH to 84% for ACT+H. In addition, in study BCIRG 006, the clinical outcomes (DFS and 
OS)  of  the  combination  of  trastuzumab  with  an  anthracycline-containing  regimen  were  numerically 
(but not statistically) superior to those of the combination of trastuzumab with carboplatin + docetaxel.   
The benefit of trastuzumab appeared greater in node-negative than in node-positive patients, with an 
HR  estimate  as  low  as  0.36  for  the  AC→T+H  regimen  although  confidence  intervals  were  large.  The 
results were essentially the same for both adjuvant regimens (ACT+H and DCarbH) in node-positive 
patients.  Interestingly, in this group of node-positive patients, trastuzumab did not show any evidence 
of  effect  at  local/regional  sites,  only  at  distant  sites.    Importantly,  there  was  no  difference  in  CNS 
metastases between the three treatment arms. 
Adjuvant  trastuzumab  is  part  of  a  treatment  strategy  that  also  involves  surgery,  chemotherapy  and 
radiotherapy.  At  present  it  is  not  clear  which  of  the  employed  chemotherapy  protocols  is  best  in 
combination with trastuzumab. Although not statistically significant, there  was a consistent numerical 
benefit  of  the  anthracycline-containing  regimen  and  concurrent  trastuzumab  administration  over  the 
anthracycline-free regimen.  The clinical relevance of this difference is unknown. 
Using HR for the primary endpoint generated from the trials gives the following order:  
AC-PH (B-31 subgroup, mostly 3-weekly P) 0.44 
0.48 
AC-PH (B-31 and N9831 joint) 
0.54 
AC-PH (N9831 subgroup, weekly P) 
0.54

0.67

Study populations were not easily comparable, for example HERA allowed the inclusion of node 
negative patients if considered at high risk by tumor size of > 1cm; in B-31 and N9831 (until 
amendment) had as inclusion criterion only node positive disease. On the other hand HERA may have 
employed chemotherapy protocols that are not regarded as optimal today.   
In order to further study the benefits of trastuzumab in this setting the MAH has committed to provide 
the data on the follow up efficacy analyses of all three trials as a follow up measure. 
3.4.  Clinical safety 
The joint safety database from B-31 and N9831 was based on data from all patients who had at least 
18 months of follow-up from the initiation of their adjuvant chemotherapy (both arms from NSABP B-
31 and two of the three arms from NCCTG N9831). The safety data for BCIRG006 were based on the 
second  planned  interim  efficacy  analysis.  This  analysis  was  conducted  after  a  median  follow-up  of  36 
months using a database cut-off date of November 01, 2006. 
In  addition,  a  cardiac  safety  update  to  the  BCIRG006  CSR  was  provided  based  on  the  data  available 
when the last patient enrolled had been followed for at least 5 years. The clinical data cut-off date for 
this update was October 16, 2009 when the median follow-up duration was approximately 66 months 
(5.5 years). 
Safety in the joint analysis was analysed in two subsets 
  Safety-evaluable  patients  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  protocol 
treatment.  Treatment  exposure  and  deaths  were  evaluated  in  this  population.  All  safety-
evaluable patients were also considered to be evaluable for cardiac safety. 
  AE-evaluable patients included safety-evaluable patients for whom an Adverse Event CRF had 
been submitted and entered into the database prior to the data cut-off date. Routinely reported 
AEs were evaluated in this subset. 
In  the  BCIRG006  study,  the  safety  population included  all  patients  who  received  at least  one  dose  of 
study treatment. 
Patient exposure 
The  median  duration  of  trastuzumab  treatment  was  close  to  one  year  in  all  trastuzumab-containing 
arms; 356 days in the NSABP B-31 study and 322 days in the NCCTG N9831 study and 378 days for 
both the AC→DH and DCarbH regimens in the BCIRG006 study. The majority of patients received the 
planned dose at each cycle and the median dose intensity was close to 1.0 in all groups. 
At the time of the joint analysis, 51.3% and 40.3% of the patients in the AC→PH arms of the NSABP B-
31  and  NCCTG  N9831  studies,  respectively,  had  completed  the  planned  duration  of  trastuzumab 
monotherapy  per  protocol,  and  similarly  75.3%  in  the  AC→DH  arm  of  the  BCIRG006  study.  More 
patients completed trastuzumab therapy (86.5%) in the DCarbH arm of the BCIRG006 study. 
Exposure to trastuzumab in the safety population is shown in Table 11.

Serious adverse event 
Serious  adverse  events  were  not  reported  in  the  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  studies.  Instead, 
certain  adverse  events  were  reported  via  the  NCI’s  Adverse  Event  Expedited  Reporting  System 
(AdEERS),  as  specified  in  each  protocol.  Expedited  reporting  of  adverse  events  via  AdEERS  was 
required  for  patients  in  the  experimental  (trastuzumab-containing)  arms  of  each  study  who  had 
received at least one dose of trastuzumab, but not in the control arms. The most commonly reported 
events in the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, respectively, were left ventricular failure (0.8%, 
1.9%),  infection  (1.3%,  2%),  dyspnoea  (1.1%,  1.2%),  pneumonitis  (0.7%  in  both  studies),  and 
thrombosis (0.6%, 1.1%). 
Serious AEs were collected and analyzed in the BCIRG006 study according to standard ICH criteria. 
Serious  non-cardiac  AE  occurring  in  ≥1%  of  patients  and  serious  cardiac  AE  occurring  at  any  time  in 
BCIRG006 are shown in Tables 14 and 15, respectively.

Significant adverse events: Cardiac safety 
Cardiac safety was assessed in the three studies using the following parameters: 
• Cardiac events 
• Cardiac deaths 
• Asymptomatic LVEF events 
The  numbers  and  percentage  of  patients  with  evidence  of  cardiac  dysfunction  (defined  as  cardiac 
events, cardiac deaths and asymptomatic LVEF events) were summarized by treatment group and by 
individual study periods. 
CHMP variation assessment report

The following definitions of cardiac events were used: 
The following definitions of cardiac death were used: 
In  studies  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  cardiac  deaths  were  defined  as  deaths  due  to  CHF, 
myocardial  infarction,  or  primary  arrhythmia  as  well  as  sudden  death  without  documented  etiology. 
These  were  reported  on  a  Cardiac  Report  Form  in  the  NSABP  B-31  study  and  on  a  Cardiac  Death 
Report  Form  in  the  NCCTG  N9831  study.  These  deaths  were  reviewed  and  confirmed  by  each 
respective  cardiac  study  committee.  Cardiac  deaths  were  summarized  by  treatment  as  received  for 
each study and for the joint safety population. 
In  study  BCIRG006  cardiac  deaths  were  reviewed  and  confirmed  by  the  Independent  Cardiac  Review 
Panel (IRCP); they were defined as death due to one of the following: 
• confirmed congestive heart failure 
• myocardial infarction 
• documented primary arrhythmia 
• probable cardiac death ie, sudden death without documented etiology. 
An autopsy was preferred in cases where cause of death had a cardiac etiology. 
The following definitions of asymptomatic LVEF events were used: 
In  studies  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  an  asymptomatic  LVEF  event  was  defined  as  an  absolute 
drop in LVEF of 10% to < 55% (eg, from 64% to 54%) or an absolute drop in LVEF of 5% to below the 
institution’s LLN. Scheduled LVEF assessments were to be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 18 
months following randomization. 
In study BCIRG006 an asymptomatic absolute decline of > 15% in LVEF from baseline and to a value 
below  the  LLN  was  considered  a  clinically  significant  asymptomatic  LVEF  event.  Scheduled  LVEF 
assessments were to be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 18 months following randomization. 
Cardiac Events 
Cardiac  events  reported  in  the  safety  population  of  studies  B-31,  N9831  and  BCIRG006  are

Exploratory  analyses  of  risk  factors  for  cardiac  events  (NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831  studies) 
demonstrated  that  trastuzumab  therapy,  older  age,  prior  or  current  use  of  antihypertensive 
medications at baseline, low LVEF prior to or following initiation of paclitaxel and LVEF value < 55% at 
least 28 days prior to the event were significant predictors of a cardiac event. In the AC→PH arm, the 
risk  of  a  cardiac  event  increased  with  the  number  of  these  risk  factors  present,  from  an  incidence  of 
0.8% when no risk factors were present to 13.0% when all three risk factors were present. When all 
three risk factors were present in the AC→P arm, the incidence of cardiac events was 4.8%. 
For  study  BCIRG006,  treatment  with  AC→DH,  decreased  on-study  LVEF  and  older  age  (>  50  years) 
were  identified  as  key  risk  factors  for  development  of  a  symptomatic  cardiac  event.  Patients  in  the 
AC→DH arm had an estimated 3.75-fold higher risk of a cardiac event compared with patients in the 
AC→D arm. 
Findings were similar in the 18-month update to the joint analysis NSABP B-31/NCCTG N9831 and the 
5-year cardiac update to the BCIRG006 study. 
Cardiac Deaths 
In studies B-31 and N9831, there were 12 cardiac deaths: 2 patients treated with AC→T + H and 10 
treated with AC→T (6 randomised to AC→T→H and 4 randomised to AC→T).  In study BCIRG006 one 
patient  who  developed  atrial  fibrillation  and  heart  failure  with  cardiomyopathy  eventually  died  in  the 
AC→T group.

Asymptomatic drop in LVEF 
The  incidence  of  asymptomatic  LVEF  declines  was  higher  in  the  trastuzumab  groups  than  in  the 
chemotherapy only group (see Figures 4 and 5)

Longer term data on cardiac events  
For  the  joint  analysis  (NSABP B-31  and  NCCTG N9831),  patients  who  developed  cardiac  dysfunction 
are patients who had any cardiac event, defined as symptomatic CHF (non-death) or cardiac death; or 
patients with an asymptomatic LVEF event defined as an absolute drop of LVEF of 10% compared with 
baseline  to  below  55%  or  an  absolute  drop  in  LVEF  of  5%  compared  with  baseline  to  below  the  LLN.

There  were  463,  743  and  126 patients  who  developed  cardiac  dysfunction  in  the  ACP,  ACPH  and 
ACPH arms. 
Figure 6 presents mean LVEF over time for this subgroup of patients based on the database supported 
18-month  safety  update,  in  the  Joint  Analysis  study,  starting  from  the  doxorubicin  plus 
cyclophosphamide (AC) baseline. The mean AC baseline was similar between the trastuzumab groups 
and the ACP (ACT) group in this subgroup of patients. In the ACPH (ACTH) patients, the largest 
mean absolute percentage point decrease from baseline was seen at 9 months, similarly to the mean 
LVEF  over  time  for  all  patients.  In  the  ACPH  (ACTH)  group,  the  largest  mean  absolute 
percentage point decrease from baseline was seen at 18 months, similarly to the whole population. 
Figure 6. Joint analysis (NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831) study: Mean LVEF for patients who developed 
cardiac dysfunction 
For the BCIRG006 study, patients who developed cardiac dysfunction were defined as patients with any 
cardiac event where cardiac event, defined as Grade 3 or 4 symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), 
Grade 3 or 4 myocardial infarction, or cardiac death; or patients with an asymptomatic left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) event, defined as an absolute decline of > 15% in LVEF from baseline and to a 
value  below  the  lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN).  There  were  45,  115  and  47 patients  who  developed 
cardiac dysfunction in the ACD (ACT), ACDH (ACTH) and DCarbH (TCH) arms, respectively. 
Figure  7  presents  the  mean  LVEF  over  time  for  those  patients  in  the  BCIRG006  study.  There  was  a 
general  decrease  in  LVEF  values  across  treatment  arms  from  baseline  to  the  3-month  evaluation  for 
this subgroup of patients. The mean of the largest absolute decline in LVEF values in trastuzumab arms 
was at the 9-month evaluation.

Figure 7. Study BCIRG006: Mean LVEF for Patients who Developed Cardiac Dysfunction 
The  data  showed  that  in  patients  who  develop  cardiac  dysfunction  the  drop  in  LVEF  associated  with 
combined trastuzumab therapy returned to a level that was consistent across the treatment arms of all 
three  studies,  however  it  did  not  return  to  a  normal  level  after  completion  of  study  treatment.  In 
conclusion, the data did not show a recovery of the cardiac function after treatment with Herceptin.  
Disease progression and cardiac dysfunction (post-hoc, exploratory analysis) 
The  MAH  performed  an  exploratory,  post-hoc  combined  analysis  of  disease  progression  (disease-free 
survival  events)  and  symptomatic  cardiac  events)  on  the  datasets  that  were  the  basis  for  the  joint 
analysis (JA) NSABP B-31/NCCTG N9831 and BCIRG006 clinical study reports (CSRs), respectively. 
The following definitions of asymptomatic cardiac events were used in the individual study protocols:  
  NSABP  B-31  and  NCCTG  N9831:  absolute  drop  in  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  of 
10% to < 55% or absolute drop in LVEF of 5% to below the institution’s lowest limit of normal 
(LLN). 
 BCIRG006: absolute decline in LVEF of > 15% from baseline and to a value below the LLN. 
 
As  the  LLN  of  each  participating  institution  was  used  as  baseline  not  a  single  one  threshold  for 
“baseline”  can  be  defined  for  the  requested  analysis,  rendering  it  not  possible  to  apply  a  common 
definition of asymptomatic events across all studies. 
In  the  joint  analysis  NSABP B-31/NCCTG N9831,  the  primary  analysis  comprised  394 DFS  events;  of 
these,  261 events  were  in  the  chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  133 events  in  the  trastuzumab  plus 
chemotherapy  arm.  When  cardiac  dysfunction  (symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  events)  was  also 
included,  the  combined  analysis  comprised  1173 events;  of  these,  532 events  were  in  the 
chemotherapy  alone  arm  and  641 events  in  the  trastuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm.  The  earliest 
contributing events by treatment arm, hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) are also 
summarized  in  Table  22.  It  is  noted  that  the  large  majority  of  contributing  events  for  the  combined 
analysis were asymptomatic cardiac events.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the B-31 and N9831 trials the incidence of haematological toxicities was higher in the AC→PH arm 
compared with the AC→P arm (38.6% vs 34.6% for any grade AEs in NSABP B-31; 33.1% vs 27.1% 
Grade 3-5 AEs in NCCTG N9831). The most frequent events were decreased haemoglobin (in NSABP B-
31  only),  decreased  leukocytes  and  decreased  neutrophils.  These  occurred  with  a  higher  incidence  in 
the  AC→PH  arm  compared  with  the  AC→P  arm.  However,  for  Grade  3-5  toxicities,  the  differences 
between the  trastuzumab-containing and control arms were small in the NSABP B-31 (< 1%). In the 
NCCTG  N9831  study,  a  higher  incidence  of  neutropenia  was  observed  in  the  AC→PH  arm  (32.1%) 
compared  with  the  AC→P  arm  (25.8%);  this  correlated  with  the  increased  incidence  of  febrile 
neutropenia in the AC→PH arm (7.2% vs 3.5%). 
In BCIRG006 study the incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia and leucopenia was higher in the AC→DH 
arm (71.3% and 60.1%, respectively) compared with the AC→D arm (63.1% and 51.4%, respectively) 
(see  Table  26).  However,  the  incidence  of  neutropenic  infection  and  febrile  neutropenia  was  only 
slightly  higher  in  the  AC→DH  arm  compared  to  the  AC→D  arm.  The  incidence  of  Grade  3/4  anemia, 
neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia  was  higher  in  the  DCarbH  arm  (5.8%,  65.9%  and  5.4%, 
respectively)  compared  with  the  AC→D  arm  (2.5%,  63.1%  and  1.0%,  respectively).  However,  the 
incidence  of  neutropenic  infection  and  febrile  neutropenia  was  very  similar  in  the  DCarbH  and  AC→D 
arms.  More  patients  in  the  DCarbH  arm  received  prophylactic  treatment  with  granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor (G-CSF) during the first 5 cycles of treatment but by Cycle 6, the frequency of G-CSF 
use  was  similar  in  the  three  arms  (32.6%  in  AC→D,  34.6%  in  AC→DH  and  30.6%  in  DCarbH)  and 
overall,  fewer  patients  in  the  DCarb  H  arm  (40.5%)  used  G-CSF  during  the  study  than  in  the  AC→D 
(45.8%) and AC→DH arms (46.7%).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  of  study  chemotherapy  or  trastuzumab  monotherapy  were 
collected in the BCIRG 006 study.  Non-cardiac AEs led to discontinuation of chemotherapy in a similar 
proportion of patients in each of the anthracycline treatment groups (AC→T 4.2% and AC→T+H 3.6%) 
and  in  fewer  patients  in  the  DCarbH  group  (2.1%).  The  most  common  non-cardiac  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  were  neuropathy-sensory,  fatigue,  rash,  and  allergic  reaction.  Non-cardiac  AEs  led  to 
withdrawal  of  trastuzumab  monotherapy  treatment  in  a  small  proportion  (1.1%-1.2%  of  patients)  in 
each trastuzumab group, the most common reasons being dyspnoea and fatigue 
Discontinuation due to cardiac adverse events 
In Study NSABP B-31, 16% (136/844) of patients discontinued trastuzumab at any time due to clinical 
evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In 
Study  BCIRG006,  a  total  of  2.9%  (31/1056)  patients  in  the  DCarbH  (TCH)  arm  (1.5%  during  the 
chemotherapy  phase  and  1.4%  during  the  monotherapy  phase)  and  5.7%  (61/1068)  patients  in  the 
ACDH  (ACTH)  arm  (1.5%  during  the  chemotherapy  phase  and  4.2%  during  the  monotherapy 
phase) discontinued trastuzumab at any time due to cardiac toxicity. 
Post marketing experience 
The  estimated  cumulative  exposure  to  trastuzumab  since  September 25, 1998  via  commercially 
obtained drug and through clinical trials until March 24, 2010 is 815,060 patients. 
Cumulatively  to  January 31, 2010,  15,920 adverse  events  reported  to  the  MAH  met  the  criteria 
required for inclusion in PSURs.  There were 8941 (56% of the total) serious adverse events and 6979 
(44%) non-serious adverse events in a treated population. 
The most frequently reported AEs were categorized under the following System Organ Classes (SOCs): 
  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (2787 events  [18%  of  the  sum  total  of  all 
AEs]), 
investigations (1654 [10%]), 
 
  cardiac disorders (1630 events [10%]), 
  and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1529 [9.6%]). 
This cumulative analysis replicates to a large extent the findings of the PSUR  covering the period from 
March 25, 2009  to  September 24, 2009  inclusive,  in  which  the  SOCs  into  which  adverse  events  were 
most frequently categorized were: 
investigations: (138 SAEs [15.6% of total SAEs]), 
 
  cardiac disorders (127 SAEs [14.4% of total SAEs]), 
  general disorders and administration site conditions (106 SAEs [12.0% of total SAEs]). 
Overall, the safety profile of trastuzumab appears to have remained essentially unchanged over time. 
3.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  data  provided  by  the  MAH  in  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  confirmed  the  known  safety 
profile  of  Herceptin  with  respect  to  cardiac-related  AE,  haematological  toxicity  and  pulmonary 
reactions. Nevertheless updated information with regard  to adverse events in the early breast cancer 
indication has been included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and in the package leaflet. 
The  main  findings  from  studies  BCIRG  006,  N9831  and  NSABP  B31  have  shown  that  in  patients  with 
EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events was observed when 
Herceptin  was  administered  after  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy  compared  to  administration 
with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was more marked when Herceptin 
was  administered  concurrently  with  taxanes  than  when  administered  sequentially  to  taxanes. 
Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred within the first 18 months 
CHMP variation assessment report  
EMA/234266/2011  
Page 46
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  the  cumulative  incidence  did  not  increase  after  3  years.  In  addition,  the  incidence  of  grade  3/4 
cardiac  dysfunction  (symptomatic  Congestive  Heart  Failure)  was  similar  in  patients  who  were 
administered  chemotherapy  alone  (i.e.  did  not  receive  Herceptin)  and  in  patients  who  were 
administered Herceptin sequentially to a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was highest in patients who were 
administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane (2.0%). 
In  addition  it  has  been  shown  that  in  patients  who  develop  cardiac  dysfunction  the  drop  in  LVEF 
associated  with  combined  trastuzumab  therapy  returned  to  a  level  that  was  consistent  across  the 
treatment  arms  of  all  three  studies;  however  it  did  not  return  to  a  normal  level  after  completion  of 
study treatment. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted (BCIRG006; median follow-up of 5.5 years) 
a  continuous  increase  in the  cumulative  rate  of  symptomatic  cardiac  or  LVEF  events  was  observed  in 
patients  who  were  administered  Herceptin  concurrently  with  a  taxane  following  anthracycline  therapy 
up  to  2.37%  compared  to  approximately  1%  in  the  two  comparator  arms  (anthracycline  plus 
cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin and Herceptin). To address the recovery 
of  the  cardiac  function  after  treatment  with  trastuzumab  the  MAH  has  committed  to  provide  further 
follow-up  data  on  LVEF  from  studies  BCIRG  006  and  N9831.  In  addition,  details  of  evolution  of 
symptomatic events and asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction with the need and changes in the 
treatment  of  these  events  will  be  provided  by  the  MAH  from  an  ongoing  observational  study 
(OHERA/BO20652) as a post-authorisation commitment. 
When symptomatic cardiac events are counted in a combined analysis with disease progression events, 
the  benefit  of  trastuzumab  is  reduced;  however  it  remains  both  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically 
significant in favour of the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arms.  From the data presented, it is still 
unclear  whether  some  patients  with  asymptomatic  LV  dysfunction  may  show  improvements  while 
others may progress to symptomatic LV dysfunction. Thus, long-term monitoring of cardiac safety was 
considered necessary and the MAH is currently addressing this through the extended follow-up of four 
large adjuvant trastuzumab studies and a large prospective observational study (OHERA/BO20652) to 
further investigate cardiac safety in 3,800 patients enrolled in a community hospital setting in Europe.  
A clear analysis of all asymptomatic events and their evolution over time including need for treatment 
is  considered  necessary  and  will  be  provided  by  the  MAH  as  a  post-authorisation  commitment.    The 
MAH  has  been  also  requested  to  perform  a  study  to  address  long-term  cardiac  safety  using 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) as a post-authorisation commitment. 
In addition, the MAH has committed to provide results of sub-studies investigating markers of cardiac 
toxicity when available. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Cardiotoxicity 
In  patients  with  EBC  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  cardiac  events 
was  observed  when  Herceptin  was  administered  after  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy 
compared  to  administration  with  a  non-anthracycline  regimen  of  docetaxel  and  carboplatin  and  was 
more  marked  when  Herceptin  was  administered  concurrently  with  taxanes  than  when  administered 
sequentially  to  taxanes.  Regardless  of  the  regimen  used,  most  symptomatic  cardiac  events  occurred 
within the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow up of 5.5 
years  was  available  (BCIRG006)  a  continuous  increase  in  the  cumulative  rate  of  symptomatic  cardiac 
or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane 
following  anthracycline  therapy  up  to  2.37%  compared  to  approximately  1%  in  the  two  comparator 
arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin and Herceptin). 
[…] 
For  early  breast  cancer  patients,  cardiac  assessment,  as  performed  at  baseline,  should  be  repeated 
every 3 months during treatment and andevery 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 
24  months  from  the  last  administration.  In  patients  who  receive  anthracycline  containing 
chemotherapy  further  monitoring  is  recommended,  and  should  occur    yearly  up  to  5  years  from  the 
last  administration,  or  longer  if  a  continuous  decrease  of  LVEF  is  observedat  6,  12  and  24  months 
following cessation of treatment.

Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
The  frequency  of  the  adverse  reaction  “Ejection  fraction  decreased”  has  been  revised  as  “very 
common”  (instead  of  common)  to  reflect  the  increased  frequency  observed  with  combination  therapy 
following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes. 
In addition the following changes were agreed in the text:

[…] 
In  3  pivotal  clinical  trials  of  adjuvant  trastuzumab  given  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  the 
incidence  of  grade  3/4  cardiac  dysfunction  (symptomatic  Congestive  Heart  Failure)  was  similar  in 
patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (ie did not receive Herceptin) and in patients who 
were administered Herceptin sequentially to a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was highest in patients who 
were administered Herceptin concurrently with a taxane (2.0%).

Lactation 
Reproduction studies have been 
conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys at doses up to 
25 times that of the weekly 
human maintenance dose of 
2 mg/kg Herceptin and have 
revealed no evidence of 
impaired fertility or harm to the 
foetus. Placental transfer of 
trastuzumab during the early 
( days  20–50 of gestation) and 
late (days 120–150 of gestation) 
foetal development period was 
observed. It is not known 
whether Herceptin can affect 
reproductive capacity. As animal 
reproduction studies are not 
always predictive of human 
response, Herceptin should be 
avoided during pregnancy unless 
the potential benefit for the 
mother outweighs the potential 
risk to the foetus.  
In the post-marketing setting, 
cases of oligohydramnios, some 
associated with fatal pulmonary 
hypoplasia of the foetus, have 
been reported in pregnant 
women receiving Herceptin. 
Women of childbearing potential 
should be advised to use 
effective contraception during 
treatment with Herceptin and for 
at least 6 months after 
treatment has concluded.

  Beneficial effects 
Adjuvant  trastuzumab  was  associated  with  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  on 
disease free  survival. In the joint analysis of the NCCTG 9831 and NSABP B-31 trials, the addition of 
Herceptin  to  paclitaxel  chemotherapy  resulted  in  a  52%  decrease  in  the  risk  of  disease  recurrence 
(primary endpoint, DFS). The difference in terms of DFS in favour of the Herceptin arm was 6% or 9% 
at  3  years,  depending  on  the  studies.  With  the  longest  follow-up  available  (median  of  65  months),  it 
was estimated to be 9% at 5 years. 
The  effect  was  observed  in  both  node-negative  and  node-positive  tumours,  and  was  independent  of 
age or menopausal status, type of surgery/radiation therapy, and main tumour characteristics such as 
hormonal receptor status, size, or histological grade. 
In addition a clinically relevant effect on overall survival has been observed. The difference in terms of 
OS was above 2% at 3 years in all studies and with the longest follow-up available, it was estimated to 
be 5% at 5 years.

The  superiority  of  TCH  or  DCarbH  treatments  was  also  observed  in  one  trial  when  compared  to  the 
control  regimen  (AC→T)  with  a  difference  in  terms  of  DFS  estimated  to  be  5%  at  3  years  (6%  at  5 
years).    The  difference  in  terms  of  OS  was  above  2%  at  3  years  and  with  the  longest  follow-up 
available, it was estimated to be 4% at 5 years. 
Adjuvant  treatment  of  trastuzumab  given  concurrently  compared  to  trastuzumab  given  sequentially 
after  completion  of  chemotherapy  shortened  the  therapy  by  around  3 months  (from  18 months  to 
15 months). With the DCarbH regimen the duration of intravenous adjuvant therapy is also shortened 
by  around  3 months  compared  with  the  AC→T+H  regimens  and  by  around  6 months  compared  with 
sequential trastuzumab. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
No  uncertainties  have  been  identified  about  the  benefit  of  the  concurrent  use  of  trastuzumab  with 
chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, 
or  as  part  of  a  treatment  regimen  in  combination  with  docetaxel  and  carboplatin)  in  the  adjuvant 
treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. All tested chemotherapy protocols in the 
provided  randomised  trials  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  increased  progression  free  survival  and 
decreased the risk for relapse. 
A direct comparison of the different chemotherapy protocols was not available. It is therefore possible 
that  there  are  differences  in  efficacy  for  the  different  protocols,  but  the  clinical  relevance  of  these 
differences are unknown. Patient risk factors may determine the choice of the regimen and should be 
assessed in a case by case base according to the current recommendations available in the SmPC. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Important risks that have been identified in the adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab are cardiac 
events including death from cardiac compromise, infection, neutropenia, infusion reactions and 
pulmonary reactions. 
Concurrent administration of trastuzumab with a taxane increased a certain number of taxane-related 
toxicities, including haematological  toxicities.    Most  importantly,  cardiac  toxicity  appeared  worse  than 
with  sequential  administration.  When  taking  into  account  both  symptomatic  CHF  events  and 
asymptomatic declines in LVEF, the cumulative incidence of cardiac dysfunction events - depending on 
the  definition  of  LVEF  decline  -  reached  at  3  years  36%  (AC→T+H)  vs.  24%  (for  AC→T)  in  the  B-31 
and N9831 studies and 11% vs. 5%, respectively, in the BCIRG 006 study.  Results were intermediate 
with sequential administration. 
All  adverse  reactions  and  risks  associated  with  the treatment  have  been  addressed  adequately in  the 
SmPC. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects. 
It is not clear whether a true difference exists in the occurrence of cardiac events between different 
chemotherapy protocols in combination with trastuzumab. AE collection was not standardised and is 
not comparable across trials. Only one chemotherapy regimen (DCarbH or TCH) tested in BCIRG006 
appears to have a considerably lower risk of cardiac events than the other protocols. It is at present 
unknown whether the rate of patients with cardiac compromise will continue to rise in the future. To 
address the recovery of the cardiac function after treatment with trastuzumab the MAH has committed 
to provide further follow-up data on LVEF from studies BCIRG 006 and N9831. In addition, details of 
evolution of symptomatic events and asymptomatic declines in ejection fraction with the need and 
changes in the treatment of these events will be provided by the MAH from an ongoing observational 
study (OHERA/BO20652) as a post-authorisation commitment. 
Moreover, long-term monitoring of cardiac safety was considered necessary and the MAH is currently 
addressing this through the extended follow-up of four large adjuvant trastuzumab studies and the 
CHMP variation assessment report

large prospective observational study (OHERA/BO20652) to further investigate cardiac safety in 3,800 
patients enrolled in a community hospital setting in Europe. The MAH has been also requested to 
perform a study to address long-term cardiac safety using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging 
(CMR) as a post-authorisation commitment. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Survival without recurrence of disease is of utmost importance to the patient in the adjuvant setting. 
The  predominant  short  term  risk,  i.e.  non-fatal  cardiac  AE,  infusion  reactions,  infections  appear  less 
important in this context. Long term or later occurring consequences of cardiac compromise could be 
of  major  importance  to  the  patient  later  in  life.  Given  that  the  majority  of  patients  will  not  have  a 
relapse  (at  least  according  to  current  data)  the  issue  of  cardiac  damage  in  later  life  could  become 
increasingly  important.  The  long-term  consequences  of  the  declines  in  LVEF  observed  after 
trastuzumab therapy are still not well understood while several large scale studies have proven beyond 
doubt that asymptomatic LV dysfunction irrespective of original injury has poor prognosis. 
In  order  to  better  characterise  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  trastuzumab,  a  combined  analysis  of  DFS 
and cardiac dysfunction events was assessed. With beneficial effects in terms of DFS and long-lasting 
cardiac  dysfunction,  this  analysis  becomes  even  more  valuable  in  order  to  better  define  and  quantify 
the margin of benefit allowed by trastuzumab treatment. 
In addition, the new anthracycline-free regimen proposed may decrease the long-term and life-altering 
toxicities (CHF or acute leukemia) of anthracycline-containing regimens. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy protocols is favourable 
and the beneficial effects as reflected in increased PFS and OS outweigh the unfavourable effects.  
Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns, 
no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information. 
4.  Conclusion 
On 17 March 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and recommended  the 
agreed  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and 
Package Leaflet.

To update sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on an interaction with the selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in section 4.5 
and consequential information concerning this 
interaction in section 4.4. The Package leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. 
To update 4.8 of the SmPC to add "Rash exfoliative" 
as a new undesirable effect. 
Furthermore minor editorial correction to DE, HR, NO 
and PL text were introduced. These changes have 
been previously approved for the reference medicinal 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. The MAH 
has submitted an Addendum to Clinical Overview (ACO) to 
provide details of the efficacy and safety of Clopidogrel 
Krka since its approval. In the CHMP’s view the provided 
data do not change the overall knowledge about the 
beneficial effect and safety profile of clopidogrel when used 
in the approved indications. 
The beneficial effect of Clopidogrel Krka remains in line with 
that of the originator product (Plavix), and is considered 
positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommended that Clopidogrel Krka 
Marketing Authorisation can be renewed with unlimited 
validity.

regarding rebound effect (in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8). 
This has generally been observed within 12 weeks after 
stopping fingolimod, but has also been reported up to 24 
weeks after fingolimod discontinuation recommending the 
patient monitoring if treatment discontinuation is deemed 
necessary. 
Furthermore, post marketing data was also provided to 
support changes related to the LEG 037 procedure 
concerning the increased risk of major congenital 
malformations and contraindication of Gilenya use in 
pregnant women and women of child-bearing potential, not 
using effective contraception regarding its reproductive 
toxicity. As a result SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6 have 
been updated to include contraindication regarding 
pregnant women and WCBP not using effective 
contraception.

fingolimod, a baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
should be available (usually within 3 months) as a 
reference. During routine MRI, physicians should pay 
attention to PML suggestive lesions. In case of PML is 
suspected, MRI should be performed immediately for 
diagnostic purposes and treatment with fingolimod should 
be suspended until PML has been excluded.

Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Gilenya continues to be favourable. 
However, since the first launch of the product, the following 
safety issues have been identified with Gilenya: 
bradyarrhythmia, PRES, lymphoma, periodicity of complete 
blood count (CBC), HPS, hypersensitivity following a 
bullous erythema multiform , PML, cryptococcal infections, 
opportunistic infections, BCC, urticarial, angioedema, 
Kaposi sarcoma, Tumefactive relapses, T-wave inversion, 
peripheral oedema, retinal disorders, RCVS, fatal cases 
including unexplained death and safety concerns after 
treatment by DMTs. These issues have led to updates of 
the SmPC and updates of the Pharmacovigilance Plan.

recommended additional information related to the 
mechanism of action (ie redistribution of lymphocytes) and 
the distribution of fingolimod into the brain and male 
semen, respectively, in the SmPC, as follows: 
- Mechanism of action: Animal studies have shown that the 
redistribution of lymphocytes reduces the infiltration of 
pathogenic lymphocytes, including pro-inflammatory Th17 
cells, into the CNS. 
- Distribution: A study in four healthy subjects who 
received a single intravenous dose of a radioiodolabelled 
analogue of fingolimod demonstrated that fingolimod 
penetrates into the brain. In a study in 13 male multiple 
sclerosis patients who received Gilenya 0.5 mg/day, the 
mean amount of fingolimod (and fingolimod phosphate) in 
seminal ejaculate, at steady-state, was approximately 
10,000 times lower than the oral dose administered (0.5

available data regarding fingolimod metabolism, the CHMP 
concluded that no further data were provided that could 
exclude CYP3A4 involvement in fingolimod metabolism and 
therefore support the changes to the SmPC proposed 
initially by the MAH (i.e. deletion of the reference to 
CYP3A4 as an enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway of 
fingolimod and deletion of the cautionary statement related 
to the interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors). The CHMP 
however recommended to reflect in the SmPC on the 
possible involvement of CYP isoenzymes other than CYP4F2 
in fingolimod metabolism. Based on this assessment, the 
MAH did not pursue their initial proposed SmPC changes 
and agreed with the CHMP recommendations.

section 4.4. The warning regarding varicella zoster 
virus (VZV) is updated to ascertain appropriate 
assessment of patient immunity to VZV prior to 
treatment. Section 4.2 was updated regarding signs 
of treatment related abnormalities present prior to 
switching therapy to Gilenya and the introductory 
efficacy/safety paragraph of section 5.1 was 
complemented by mentioning the third study 
completed after authorisation. Annex II and Sections 
2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet were amended

- Neutropenia was replaced by cytopenia regarding the 
signs of relevant treatment related abnormalities when 
switching directly therapy to Gilenya. 
- Some ADRs were grouped (hepatic enzymes increases) 
and some frequencies were updated: hepatic enzyme 
increases, sinusitis, macular oedema, atrioventricular 
blocks and reduction in values for forced expiratory 
volume. This resulted in changes from common to very 
common adverse reactions (ADRs) for hepatic enzyme 
increases and sinusitis.  
- The overall rate of infections was updated. Herpes 
infection was added as a more common lower respiratory 
tract infection seen in Gilenya treated patients but 
observed at a lesser extent than bronchitis. The terms 
“influenza viral infection” and “tinea infections” were 
replaced by “influenza” and “tinea versicolor”, respectively, 
as considered as a more accurate description of these 
ADRs. 
- The following ADRs were deleted: gastroenteritis, 
paraesthesia, eye pain and weight decreased. 
- PRES was included as a warning with physicians advised 
to stop Gilenya treatment if PRES is suspected. 
- The existing warnings to ascertain appropriate 
assessment of patient immunity to VZV prior to treatment 
and on the concomitant use of corticosteroids were 
strengthened.

reporting leucopenia and lymphopenia with at least 
important information such as time to onset and outcomes. 
Incidence of infections in clinical trials was found greater in 
groups of patients with a nadir lymphocyte count 
<0.2x109/L than in group 0.2-0.4x109/L and >0.4x109/L. 
In post-marketing, the lymphocytes counts were unknown 
for a significant number of cases so a correlation between 
infections and lymphocyte count could not be excluded. 
Subsequently to these findings and taking also into account 
the data from last PSUR regarding fatal cases related to 
infections, the CHMP considered relevant to specify a 
periodicity for the complete blood count (CBC) in the 
SmPC. An update of the existing warning was made 
recommending assessment of CBC at month 3 and at least

CHMP requested the MAH to review available data 
regarding the bradyarrhythmia effect of fingolimod and the 
occurrence of lymphoma. Subsequently to assessment of 
the presented analyses, the Product information has been 
updated to include the following concepts: 
- Section 4.4: after the first dose, the decline in heart rate 
starts within one hour, and is maximal within 6 hours. This 
post-dose effect persists over the following days, although 
usually to a milder extent, and usually abates over the next 
weeks. With continued administration, the average heart 
rate returns towards baseline within one month. However 
individual patients may not return to baseline heart rate by 
the end of the first month.  
- Section 4.8: there have been cases of lymphoma of 
different varieties, in both clinical studies and the post-
marketing setting, including a fatal case of Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) positive B-cell lymphoma. The incidence of 
lymphoma (B-cell and T-cell) cases was higher in clinical 
trials than expected in the general population. 
In addition, section 4.8 has been updated to be in line with 
section 4.4 regarding the information on the 
bradyarrhythmia effect and to include hypotension as an 
associated symptom as follows: bradycardia was generally 
asymptomatic but some patients experienced mild to 
moderate symptoms, including hypotension, dizziness, 
fatigue and/or palpitations, which resolved within the first 
24 hours after treatment initiation.

Based on the SmPC recommendation, all patients starting

treatment with Gilenya should have their heart activity 
recommendation for the same first dose monitoring 
and PL 
monitored before receiving the first dose of the medicine 
in specific situations when treatment is re-initiated 
after it was interrupted (reference is also made in 
section 4.2) and to recommend repeated first dose 
monitoring for the second dose in patients requiring 
pharmacological intervention after the first dose. 
Annex II and the Package Leaflet have been 
amended accordingly. Changes to the Product 
Information were also made in accordance with the 
latest QRD templates and the contact details of the 
local representative in Malta was updated. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
and continuously for at least six hours thereafter as some 
patients may develop heart problems such as bradycardia 
(a slow heart rate) or atrioventricular block (a problem with 
the conduction of electricity in the heart). The SmPC of 
Gilenya also recommends that this first dose monitoring be 
repeated if a patient, who was treated for more than 1 
month with Gilenya and stopped taking it for two weeks or 
more, re-starts treatment. The timeframe of Gilenya 
therapy interruption has been investigated by the MAH 
using pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models and titration 
data to better define when such monitoring should be 
considered. Based on these data, the CHMP recommended 
to extend the current advice for heart activity monitoring in 
case of re-initiation of treatment to the following situations: 
1) treatment is interrupted for one day or more during the 
first 2 weeks of treatment, 2) treatment is interrupted for 
more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment. In 
addition, such monitoring should be repeated for the 
second dose in patients requiring pharmacological 
intervention during the first dose.

is as follows: 
Section 4.4: 
Recent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and 
bilirubin levels should be available before initiation of 
treatment with Gilenya. In the absence of clinical 
symptoms, liver transaminases should be monitored at 
Months 1, 3, 6 ,9 and 12 on therapy and periodically 
thereafter. If liver transaminases rise above 5 times the 
ULN, more frequent monitoring should be instituted, 
including serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
measurement. With repeated confirmation of liver 
transaminases above 5 times the ULN, treatment with 
Gilenya should be interrupted and only re-commenced once 
liver transaminase values have normalised. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8: 
In clinical studies, transaminase elevations occurred at any 
time during treatment although the majority occurred 
within the first 12 months.

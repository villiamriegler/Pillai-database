1.  Introduction 
On 19 February 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study Prot. No. 024, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development programme 
The MAH stated that the study, entitled:  
•  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, and 
Immunogenicity of V260/ROTATEQ® (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent) in Healthy 
Chinese Infants is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
The pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies  consisted of a 2 mL, oral solution of 5 live human 
bovine reassortant rotavirus strains (G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8]), which contained a minimum of 2.0 
to 2.8 × 106 infectious units (IU) per reassortant dose, depending on the serotype, and not greater 
than 116 × 106 IU per dose in the aggregate. The reassortants were suspended in a buffered stabilizer 
solution which contained sucrose, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, sodium 
hydroxide, polysorbate 80, culture media (containing inorganic salts, amino acids and vitamins), and 
also purified water. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for:  
•  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, and 
Immunogenicity of V260/ROTATEQ® (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent) in Healthy 
Chinese Infants 
The applicant has provided data published in the literature that China has experienced significant 
morbidity and economic burden associated with rotavirus infection. In 2007, there were an estimated 
12.1 million annual rotavirus diarrhoea episodes, which resulted in 3.5 million rotavirus-related 
outpatient visits and 220,000 paediatric hospital admissions. Rotavirus accounts for approximately 31 
to 50% of hospitalized children with diarrhoea and 25% of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in outpatient 
visits in China.  Among the estimated 11,420 deaths due to diarrhea in children less than 5 years of 
age in 2008, 41.3% were attributable to rotavirus.  
In accordance with the China Regulatory Requirements for licensure of new vaccines, a Phase I study 
(V260 PN028) was completed in 2010 and demonstrated that RotaTeq™ was generally well tolerated in 
Chinese adults, children, and infants.

In order to support the NDA for RotaTeq™ in China, Protocol 024, a Phase III study, was designed as a 
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-centered trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity of RotaTeq™ among infants in China. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of RotaTeq™ against RVGE caused by naturally-
occurring rotavirus (regardless of serotype or disease severity) in Chinese infants. This study also 
assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the China Expanded program in Immunisation (EPI) 
vaccines,  oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and diphtheria, tetanus, acellular  pertussis vaccine (DTaP)  
when given concomitantly with RotaTeq™/placebo in subjects participating in the Concomitant Use 
Cohort.

Study design 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centered study conducted in conformance 
with Good Clinical Practices. The purpose was to investigate clinical efficacy, immunogenicity, and 
safety/tolerability of a 3-dose regimen of V260 (ROTATEQ®) in healthy Chinese infants. Approximately 
4040 eligible infants, at least 6 weeks (42 days) and up to 12 weeks (84 days) of age at time of the 
first vaccination of ROTATEQ®/placebo, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
ROTATEQ® or placebo. In this study, administration of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and diphtheria, 
tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) were allowed according to China Expanded Program on 
Immunization (EPI). OPV and DTaP were administered either in a concomitant-use or in a staggered-
use dosing schedule with ROTATEQ®/placebo. All subjects were followed for efficacy and safety. 
Antibody responses to OPV, DTaP, and ROTATEQ® were evaluated in a subset of subjects. 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 4040 eligible infants, at least 6 weeks (42 days) and up to 12 weeks (84 days) of age at 
time of the first vaccination of ROTATEQ®/placebo, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either ROTATEQ® or placebo. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 vaccination groups to receive either 
RotaTeq™ or placebo. Each subject received 3 doses of RotaTeq™/placebo administered approximately 
4 weeks apart and was followed for a minimum of 30 days following the final vaccination of 
RotaTeq™/placebo for safety follow-up. 
Both OPV and DTaP, the routine China Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines, were 
allowed as standard of care and administered either in a concomitant-use or in a staggered use dosing 
schedule with RotaTeq™/placebo. The subjects were allocated to 1 of 2 Cohorts: 
The Staggered Use Cohort  
ROTATEQ®/placebo was given in a staggered fashion with OPV + DTaP (includes non-immunogenicity 
subgroup and immunogenicity subgroup). A total of 3240 subjects received 3 doses of 
ROTATEQ®/placebo in a 1:1 ratio, administered approximately 4 weeks apart. 
Concomitant Use Cohort

entire study (defined as last subject’s last study visit). 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: 
Primary Analysis 
Statistical methodology: For the primary hypothesis, ROTATEQ® was considered efficacious if the 
lower bound of the 2-sided CI for efficacy was > 0% at the final analysis. To calculate the CI and 
associated p-value, an exact conditional method based on a Poisson distribution was used, which 
evaluates the number of subjects with RVGE in the group that received ROTATEQ® conditional on the 
total number of subjects with RVGE, accounting for any potential differential follow-up between the 2 
vaccination groups. The Clopper-Pearson method was used for the CI. 
Key Secondary Analysis 
The statistical methodology was the same as the primary analysis. 
The Per-Protocol for efficacy (PPE) population served as the primary population for the analysis of 
efficacy in this study. The PPE population was defined as subjects who received the 3 scheduled doses 
of study vaccine, adhered to guidelines for the administration of the study vaccine, and did not have 
important deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the primary efficacy 
endpoint.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/412818/2016 
Page 5/20 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity: 
For the OPV components, the statistical criterion was that the difference in the percentage with 
seroconversion between subjects receiving ROTATEQ® concomitantly with OPV/ DTaP versus subjects 
receiving placebo concomitantly with OPV/ DTaP (ROTATEQ® minus placebo) excluded a decrease of 
10 percentage points or more. One-sided tests of H0: PV260-PPlacebo ≤ -0.10 versus H1: PV260-
PPlacebo > -0.10 was performed at the 0.025 Confidential significance level for each of the poliovirus 
components. The statistical criterion for non-inferiority corresponded to the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in the seroprotection rates (ROTATEQ® minus placebo) excluding a decrease of 10%. The 
95% CI was calculated using the method proposed by Miettinen and Nurminen. 
The Per-Protocol for Immunogenicity (PPI) population served as the primary population for the analysis 
of immunogenicity in this study. The PPI population was antigen specific. Evaluable subjects were 
those who received their scheduled doses without intervening laboratory-confirmed disease specific to 
the antigen earlier than the blood sample collection Postdose 3, adhered to the guidelines for 
administration of vaccine, and had valid values available for analysis within specified day ranges. 
Safety: 
The analysis of safety results followed a tiered approach. The tiers differed with respect to the analyses 
that were performed. Safety parameters or adverse experiences of special interest that were identified 
a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that were subjected to inferential testing for statistical 
significance with p values and 95% CIs provided for between-group comparisons. Other safety 
parameters were considered Tier 2 or Tier 3.Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point estimates with 
95% CIs provided for between group comparisons; only point estimates by vaccination group were 
provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.  
The All-Subjects-as-Treated (ASaT) population was used for the analysis of safety data in this study. 
The ASaT population consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of ROTATEQ or 
placebo. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed  
The disposition of subjects is provided by vaccination group for all randomized subjects in Table 1. Of 
the 4173 subjects screened, a total of 133 subjects were screened for the study but never randomized. 
The most common reason for subjects not randomized was screen failure (98.5%). 
Of the 4040 subjects randomized, 4037 (99.9%) subjects received at least 1 dose of study vaccine. 
Overall, 96.0% of the subjects completed the 3-dose series of study vaccination and 95.9% of the 
subjects completed the study. The number (%) of subjects that discontinued from the study was low 
and similar in the 2 vaccination groups (4.5% in the group that received ROTATEQ® vs. 3.7% in the 
placebo group). The most common reason for study discontinuation was withdrawal by 
parent/guardian. 
Overall, 3 subjects were randomized but not vaccinated and 158 (3.9%) subjects discontinued from 
study vaccination prior to receiving 3 doses. The number (%) of subjects discontinued from the study 
vaccination was low and similar in the 2 vaccination groups (4.2% in the group that received

ROTATEQ® vs. 3.6% in the placebo group). The most common reason for vaccination discontinuation 
was withdrawal by subject (parent/guardian). 
Enrolment was conducted at 5 study sites in Guangxi of China.

Efficacy results 
Primary Analysis of Efficacy Against RVGE Caused by Naturally Occurring 
Rotavirus (regardless of serotype or disease severity) 
A summary of the primary PPE analysis is given in Table 2. This includes an accounting of the subjects 
included in the primary analysis of efficacy in the per-protocol population using the per-protocol case 
definition , as well as a point estimate, confidence interval (CI), and p-value for efficacy. As shown in 
Table 2, the point estimate of primary vaccine efficacy against RVGE caused by naturally-occurring 
rotavirus (regardless of serotype and disease severity), occurring at least 14 days following the third 
dose was 69.3% in the PPE population. The lower bound of the corresponding two-sided 95% CI was 
54.5%, with a p value of <0.0001. Of the 143 subjects classified as RVGE cases according to the per-
protocol case definition, 49 cases were G1 serotype, 5 were G2 serotype, 4 were G3 serotype, 2 were 
G4 serotype, and a total of 132 were G serotypes containing P1A[8].

Efficacy Follow-up Period in the Per-Protocol Population Using Per-Protocol Case Definition 
Analysis of Efficacy Against Any RVGE Occurring at least 14 Days after the First 
Vaccination: 
A total of 147 RVGE cases were included in the ITT analysis. In addition to 143 RVGE cases which were 
included in the PPE analysis, there were 4 RVGE cases identified in the interval from 14 days after the 
first dose to 13 days after the third dose. The efficacy estimate of RotaTeq™ against RVGE caused by 
any rotavirus serotype that occurred at least 14 days after the first dose was 69.0% with a 95% CI 
(54.4, 79.4). 
Analysis of Efficacy Against RVGE Caused by G1, G2, G3, G4, and G serotypes that 
Contained P1A[8]: 
Nearly all of the cases of RVGE that occurred in PN024 were due to serotypes contained in the vaccine. 
Thus, the efficacy against any-severity and severe RVGE caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine 
(G1, G2, G3, G4, and G-serotypes that contain P1A[8] (i.e. G9)) that occurred at least 14 days 
following the third vaccination was 69.9% with a 95% CI (55.2, 80.3) and 78.9% with a 95% CI (59.1, 
90.1), respectively. 
Analysis of Efficacy Against Gastroenteritis by Any Cause: 
A secondary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of RotaTeq™ against gastroenteritis of any 
cause when compared with placebo. Data showed the efficacy of RotaTeq™ against gastroenteritis of

any cause occurring at least 14 days Postdose 3 was 14.1% with a 95% CI (1.9, 24.8) in the PPE 
population, and the efficacy of RotaTeq™ against severe gastroenteritis of any cause occurring at least 
14 days Postdose 3 was 49.9% with a 95% CI (29.0, 65.1) in PPE population. 
Secondary Outcomes 
Immunogenicity Analyses 
A secondary objective of this study was to characterize the antibody responses against oral poliovirus 
vaccine (OPV) and diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) antigens in the populations 
that include any subject who received OPV and DTaP concomitantly (on the same day) with each of the 
3 doses of RotaTeq™/placebo. This was conducted on subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 Immunogenicity 
Subgroup A (Concomitant Use) which included 400 subjects. For antibody responses to OPV, 187 
subjects who received RotaTeq™ and 192 subjects who received placebo were included in the per-
protocol immunogenicity (PPI) analysis. The hypothesis tested was the proportion of subjects who 
achieve the OPV seroprotection criteria: neutralizing antibody titers ([NA] ≥1:8) for poliovirus types 1, 
2, and 3, measured at Postdose 3 of OPV, in subjects receiving OPV concomitantly with V260 is non - 
inferior to that in subjects  receiving OPV concomitantly with placebo. [Noninferiority criterion 
corresponds to the lower bound of the two -sided 95% confidenceinterval on the difference in 
proportions, excluding a decrease of ≥10 percentage points]. The statistical criterion for non-inferiority 
was met; see Table 4. 
In addition, antibody responses to DTaP antigens were characterized; 187 subjects who received 
RotaTeq™ and 194 subjects who received placebo were included in the PPI analysis (Table  5). The 
geometric mean titer (GMTs) and seroprotection rate/seropositivity rate (SPRs) of these antibodies 
were generally comparable between the RotaTeq + OPV + DTaP group and the placebo + OPV + DTaP 
group.

Other secondary objectives included characterizing the immunogenicity of RotaTeq™ as measured by 
1) serum anti-rotavirus total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and 2) serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) 
responses to the human rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8].  
Analysis on anti-rotavirus total IgA was conducted on subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 Immunogenicity 
Subgroup A (Concomitant Use) and Cohort 2 Immunogenicity Subgroup B (Staggered Use), while type-
specific SNA was performed in subjects of Cohort 2 Immunogenicity Subgroup B (Staggered Use). A 
total of 361 subjects who received RotaTeq™ and 372 subjects who received placebo were included in 
the PPI analysis for anti-rotavirus total IgA (Table 6). A total of 175 subjects who received RotaTeq™

Safety:  
The study included a secondary objective to evaluate the safety of RotaTeq™ with respect to all AEs 
within 30 days after each dose of RotaTeq™/placebo. The safety for concomitant vaccination of 
RotaTeq™ together with OPV and DTaP in the Concomitant Use Group (including immunogenicity 
subgroup and non-immunogenicity subgroup) was also assessed. 
All AEs (non-serious and serious) regardless of causality were collected for all randomized subjects for 
30 days following each vaccination of RotaTeq™/placebo. The safety data were collected for Day 1 (day 
of vaccination) to Day 14 using a standardized VRC (vaccine report card). All safety follow-up periods 
include the day of vaccination. The VRC was reviewed with parent/legal guardian at Study Visits 2, 4, 
and 6. All AEs reported by the parent/legal guardian from Day 15 to Day 30 following each dose of 
RotaTeq™/placebo were also collected. All the subjects who received at least 1 vaccination are 
included in the summaries of AEs. 
The safety of RotaTeq™ with attention to elevated temperature (axillary temperature ≥37.5ºC, or 
equivalent), vomiting, diarrhoea (within 30 days following vaccination) and intussusception (IS) was 
also analysed. Maximum axillary temperatures were measured daily through 7 days following each 
vaccination and recorded on the VRC. Pre-specified solicited AEs of diarrhoea and/or vomiting were 
collected through 14 days following each vaccination and recorded on the VRC. 
Subjects with SAEs were followed until resolution or the end of study. SAEs, deaths, and/or cases of IS 
were reported from the time of consent until the end of the study for all subjects (last subject’s last 
study visit) and were reported immediately to study personnel regardless of causality. The broad AE 
categories consisting of the percentage of subjects with any AE, a vaccine-related AE, an SAE, an AE 
which is both vaccine-related and serious, and those who discontinued due to an AE were summarized 
and analysed. 
Adverse Events Among All Subjects in the Study 
Table 8 displays a summary of AEs according to study vaccination received for all vaccinated subjects 
that occurred within 30 days following any vaccination. There were 1,079 subjects (53.5%, 
1,079/2,015) with 1 or more AEs in the group that received RotaTeq™, and 1,077 subjects (53.3%, 
1,077/2,019) in the placebo group. In the group that received RotaTeq™, 116 subjects experienced 
SAEs, and the same number of subjects had SAEs in the placebo group. A total of 29 subjects 
discontinued due to an AE. 
The incidences of subjects with AEs, SAEs, deaths, vaccine-related AEs, vaccine-related SAEs, and any 
discontinuation due to AEs, appeared comparable within the 2 vaccination groups. 
No deaths were reported within 30 days following any vaccination for all subjects. However, one 
(<0.1%) death was reported during the study follow-up period, which occurred in the placebo group 
and was considered to be unrelated to the study vaccination. Two (2) IS cases were reported during 
the trial, and both were observed in the group that received RotaTeq™, but were considered by the 
study investigator to be unrelated to the study vaccination.

The AEs for all subjects in the Concomitant Use Group that occurred within 30 days following any 
vaccination in the group that received RotaTeq™ and the placebo group are summarized in Table 9. 
Table 9 also provides an analysis of AEs between the recipients of RotaTeq™ and placebo in the 
Concomitant Use Group (ASaT). For subjects with one or more AEs, no significant difference was 
observed between the group that received RotaTeq™ and the placebo group. Furthermore, there were 
a similar number of subjects with an SAE reported in the group that received RotaTeq™ (5%) and the 
placebo group for the Concomitant Use Group (5.5%).

incidences were generally comparable between the group that received RotaTeq™ and the placebo 
group.

The most common (incidence ≥10%) AEs were pyrexia (20.5% in RotaTeq™ recipients vs. 20.8% in 
placebo recipients), diarrhea (20.1% in RotaTeq™ recipients vs. 20.1% in placebo recipients) and 
nasopharyngitis (11.3% in RotaTeq™ recipients vs. 11.5% in placebo recipients). 
For these AEs, the incidences in the group of RotaTeq™ were comparable with that of the placebo 
group.

Analysis of Overall Adverse Events in Concomitant Use Group 
The analysis of subjects with AEs (incidence ≥1% in one or more vaccination groups) by system organ 
class, within 30 days following any vaccination in the Concomitant Use Group is summarized in Table 
11. The incidences of AEs appeared to be generally comparable between the group that received 
RotaTeq™ and the placebo group. 
The most common (incidence ≥10%) AEs observed in the group of RotaTeq™ were diarrhoea (22.0%) 
and pyrexia (19.5%). The most common (incidence >10%) AEs in the group of placebo were diarrhea 
(27.5%) and pyrexia (20.5%).

Serious Adverse Events 
The safety of RotaTeq™ with respect to SAEs was evaluated for all subjects throughout the entire 
study. 
Table 12 presents the number (%) of subjects with SAEs (incidence ≥1% in one or more vaccination 
groups). The most common (incidence ≥1%) SAEs were bronchopneumonia (6.4% in RotaTeq™ 
recipients and 7.0% in placebo recipients), followed by bronchitis (4.2% in RotaTeq™ recipients and 
5.0% in placebo recipients) and enteritis (2.3% in RotaTeq™ recipients and 2.0% in placebo 
recipients). The overall incidences of SAE appeared to be comparable between recipients of RotaTeq™ 
and placebo. 
A total of 984 SAEs were reported in a total of 667 subjects during the study. 
There were 3 SAEs considered to be vaccine-related by the investigator in this study (intestinal 
obstruction, rotavirus enteritis and infectious diarrhoea). All vaccine-related SAEs occurred in subjects 
who received placebo. 
There was no report of overdose throughout the trial.

Death 
One death (in the placebo group) due to thalassemia was reported during the study follow-up period. 
The death occurred on Day 124 Postdose 3 of placebo and was considered to be unrelated to the study 
vaccination by the investigator. 
 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
 Adverse Event of Special Interest Excluding Intussusception 
Table 13 presents the results of these comparisons, and includes the number and percentage of 
subjects in each group reporting the AEs of special interest excluding IS (elevated temperature 
[axillary temperature ≥ 37.5ºC, or equivalent], vomiting and diarrhea), as well as the risk differences 
(RotaTeq™ minus placebo), 95% CIs, and p-values for those differences. As shown in Table 13, all p-
values were greater than 0.05, two-sided. 
Overall, there was no clinical evidence of a difference between the group that received 
RotaTeq™ and the placebo group with respect to the incidences of these AEs of special clinical 
interest.

Vaccination (All Subjects as Treated Population) 
Adverse Event of Special Interest In Concomitant Use Group 
The incidences of AEs of special interest excluding IS (elevated temperature [axillary temperature 
≥37.5ºC, or equivalent], vomiting and diarrhea), were also compared in the Concomitant Use Group of 
RotaTeq™/placebo with OPV and DTaP. There was no difference in the incidences of these events of 
special interest between the group that received RotaTeq™ and the placebo group in the Concomitant 
Use Group. 
Intussusception 
There were two cases of intussusception reported in this study, both in the group that received 
RotaTeq™. Neither event of intussusception was considered vaccine related by the investigator. 
Of the two cases of IS, one case was observed in the Concomitant Use group. The first case of IS 
occurred in a 77-day old female on Day 32 Postdose 1. Per the protocol, this subject did not receive 
subsequent doses of RotaTeq™. The second case occurred in a 173-day old male on Day 53 Postdose 
3. Both subjects recovered after receiving treatment (air enema and air enema/surgical reduction, 
respectively).

Maximum Temperatures in Overall Study Population 
Axillary temperatures were collected and reported for all subjects on Days 1-7 following the receipt of 
each of the 3 doses of RotaTeq™/placebo. Temperatures collected via other methods were converted 
to axillary-equivalent temperatures. If the subject presented with an elevated temperature or had a 
reported AE of AGE and dehydration rehydration (DERE), the temperature was recorded. Any 
unscheduled assessment or symptom-driven assessment of temperature was also recorded. Fever 
>38.1°C was reported for 80.5% of subjects who received RotaTeq™ within 7 days following any 
vaccination visit and 81.0% for placebo. 
Maximum Temperatures in Concomitant Use Group 
Fever >38.1°C was reported for 84.9% of subjects who received RotaTeq™ within 7 days following any 
vaccination visit and 86.5% of subjects who received placebo. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study showed that RotaTeq was efficacious against naturally-occurring RVGE regardless of severity 
and serotype occurring at least 14 days following the third vaccination, and was also efficacious against 
naturally occurring severe RVGE regardless of serotype that occurred at least 14 days following the 
third vaccination. The ITT analysis was also consistent with the above observations with respect to 
naturally-occurring RVGE regardless of serotype and severity that occurred at least 14 days after the 
first vaccination. 
RotaTeq was highly efficacious against RVGE caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine that 
occurred at least 14 days following the third vaccination. 
The data regarding all-cause gastroenteritis showed that RotaTeq™ was efficacious against any 
severity and severe all-cause gastroenteritis that occurs at least 14 days following the third vaccination. 
With respect to immunogenicity, the immune responses with respect to Postdose 3 GMTs and SPRs 
from baseline to Postdose 3 to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis toxin, pertussis filamentous among 
recipients of RotaTeq™ were as high as those observed among recipients of placebo. 
The applicant has highlighted the fact that in this study, the proportion of subjects who had a ≥ 3-fold 
rise post vaccination in anti-rotavirus total IgA was 89.4% which is numerically lower than those of 
prior phase III studies (97.3% in PN006, 95.5% in PN007, 95.5% in PN009), which were conducted in 
developed countries. However it is numerically comparable to those observed in other developing 
countries, which was 78.3% in Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Mali) (PN015), 87.8% in Asia (Bangladesh, 
Vietnam) (PN015), and 82.8% in India (PN021). Although the exact mechanism for these differences is 
not clear, it should, nevertheless,  be noted  that there is no proven immune correlate of protection for 
natural RVGE or for rotavirus vaccines. The applicant has also stated that SNA responses to G1, G2, G3, 
G4, and P1A[8] are generally similar to those observed in other phase III studies, including PN007 in 
developed countries, PN015 and PN021 in Asian countries. 
As far as safety is concerned, the data would appear to indicate that Rotateq is generally well tolerated. 
The incidences of AEs were comparable between subjects vaccinated with RotaTeq and placebo. The 
majority of reported AEs and SAEs were determined to be not related to the study vaccine. The 
proportion of subjects, who died, experienced a SAE, experienced a vaccine-related AE or SAE, or 
discontinued from the study due to a SAE were comparable between the 2 vaccination groups.

The proportion of subjects with reported AEs of special interest (elevated temperature, diarrhoea, and 
vomiting) were comparable between the group that received RotaTeq™ and the placebo group.  
It is notable that there were 2 cases of acute intussusception reported in the Rotateq group. 
One case was observed in the Concomitant Use group. The first case of IS occurred in a 77-day old 
female on Day 32 Postdose 1 and accordingly as per the protocol, this subject did not receive 
subsequent doses of RotaTeq™. The second case occurred in a 173-day old male on Day 53 Postdose 3.  
However, neither event was considered vaccine-related by the investigator and both subjects 
recovered. Nevertheless, a small risk of IS caused by Rotavirus vaccine cannot be fully excluded, 
however, this does not significantly impact on the positive benefit risk of vaccination. 
In the Concomitant Use Group of subjects that received RotaTeq™ concomitantly with OPV and DTaP, 
the proportions of subjects with reported AEs of special interest (elevated temperature, diarrhoea, and 
vomiting) were also comparable between the group that received RotaTeq™ and the placebo group. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This study appeared to demonstrate that in healthy Chinese infants, 6 to 12 weeks of age at enrolment, 
RotaTeq™ is efficacious against naturally-occurring RVGE regardless of serotype and severity as well as 
being efficacious against naturally-occurring severe RVGE regardless of serotype that occurs at least 
14 days following the third vaccination. The vaccine is immunogenic with respect to anti-rotavirus total 
IgA response and SNA responses to G1, G2, G3, G4, P1A[8]. 
From a safety perspective, the vaccine is generally well-tolerated with respect to all clinical AEs, and 
immune responses induced by OPV and DTaP are not affected by the concomitant use of RotaTeq™.  
Accordingly, there is no change to the benefit/risk. 
Overall conclusion 
The submission is satisfactory in terms of addressing the requirements of the MAH under Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Entresto 
sacubitril/valsartan 
On 24 September 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Entresto, 
intended for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The 
applicant for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Ltd. 
Entresto will be available as 24 mg/26 mg, 49 mg/51 mg and 97 mg/103 mg film-coated tablets. The 
active substances of Entresto are sacubitril and valsartan, (ATC code: C09DX04) and the medicine works 
in two complementary ways: valsartan blocks the angiotensin II type-1 receptor, suppressing the harmful 
effects of angiotensin II on the cardiovascular system, while sacubitril blocks an enzyme known as 
neprilysin to enhance the protective neurohormonal systems of the heart. 
The benefit with Entresto is its ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or need for heart failure 
hospitalisations as compared to enalapril in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction. The most common side effects are hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment. 
Angioedema occurs uncommonly. 
The full indication is: "Entresto is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (see section 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

Brief description of the product
Chemical class: Cardiovascular therapies; small molecules
Summary  of  mode  of  action:  Mavacamten  is  a  selective  allosteric 
inhibitor  of  cardiac  myosin  that  selectively  targets  cardiac  myosin 
and reversibly inhibits its binding to actin. Mavacamten binds to and 
stabilizes the weakly-bound (“off-actin”) state of myosin, reversibly 
inhibiting the binding of myosin to actin and thereby decreasing the 
power stroke required for contraction. The mechanism of action of 
mavacamten  results  in  the  reduction  of  sarcomeric  contractility. 
Mavacamten is selective for cardiac versus skeletal forms of myosin 
and is inactive toward smooth muscle myosin.

Epidemiologic Characteristics of symptomatic obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM)
oHCM
Incidence 
Prevalence
There are limited studies and data on the incidence of oHCM.
A study conducted by Husser et al1 using InGef, with longitudinal data from 
patients  insured  in  one  of  approximately  70  German  social  health  insurers 
reported  there  was  a  gradual  annual  increase  of  HCM  from  75.8/100,000 
persons (95% CI: 75.2-76.4) in 2011 to 84.2/100,000 persons (95% CI: 83.5-
84.8) in 2015.
Using  the  records  linkage  system  of  the  Mayo  Clinic  and  of  the  Rochester 
Epidemiology Project, which accessed diagnostic data on the entire population 
of Olmsted County, Minnesota, Codd et al. reported an age and sex adjusted 
incidence  of  2.5  per  100,000  person-years  between  1975  and  1984.  The 
incidence of HCM increased from 1.4 per 100,000 in the first 5 years to 3.6 per 
100,000 in the last 5 years of study.2
More  recently,  Moon  et  al.  used  the  NHIS  claims  database,  a  mandatory 
universal health  insurance  service  for  up  to  97%  of  the  entire  South  Korean 
population.  The  incidence  rate  of  HCM  steadily  increased  from  4.15 per 
100,000 person-years in 2010 to 5.6 per 100,000 person-years in 2016, which 
has  been  attributed  to  more  frequent  screening  with  echocardiography. 
Irrespective of gender, the incidence rate of HCM reached the highest value in 
the  age  category  between  70  and  79 years,  beyond  which  the  incidence  rate 
began to decrease. The overall incidence of male HCM was 1.72-fold higher 
than that of female HCM (6.0 vs. 3.5 per 100,000 person-years, p < 0.001).3
Prevalence of HCM
HCM is the most common inheritable genetic cardiomyopathy and is known to 
be an important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality across all ages. 
Its  prevalence  in  the general  population has  been previously  estimated  to  be 
about  1:500  (0.2%).4,5 However,  this  prevalence  includes  individuals  with 
clinically  unrecognized  HCM  in  the  general  population  by  using  aggressive 
echocardiographic  screening;  therefore,  most  of  them  may  not  seek  medical 
attention due to the absence of cardiovascular symptoms.
Numerous studies have been conducted to estimate the prevalence of HCM in 
various  countries in Europe. Estimates ranged  from  4-7  per  10,000  covering 
various timeframes from 1997 through 2016.1,6,7,8,9 Husser et al. is the only 
study to adjust the estimates to the general population.

Table 2.1.1-1:
Epidemiologic Characteristics of symptomatic obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM)
oHCM
the  first 
to  examine 
Several additional studies are often cited as HCM prevalence studies. A recent 
study  by  Lannou  et  al.10 estimated  prevalence  of  HCM  in  France  as  10  per 
10,000.  However,  this  study  only  used  inpatient  records  to  identify  HCM. 
Pujades-Rodriguez  et  al.7 reported  on  the  proportion  of  HCM  patients 
identified in inpatient and outpatient settings, and approximately 30% of HCM 
patients identified did not have a hospitalization for HCM. Therefore, a study 
of  HCM  patients  identified  through  inpatient  records  only,  would  not  be  an 
accurate estimate of disease prevalence. 
The  CARDIA  study5 was 
the  prevalence  of 
echocardiographic  features  of  HCM  (ie, hypertrophied,  nondilated  left 
ventricle and maximal  wall thickness  ≥15 mm  that  were not associated  with 
systemic  hypertension)  in  a  general  population  of  4111  men  and  women.5
Although  this  study  as  well  as  more  recent  population  genetic  studies  have 
shown a prevalence of HCM around 1:500 or even higher, most of the patients 
whose  echocardiograph results met the criteria for HCM were asymptomatic 
and  undiagnosed,  which  is  supported  by  the  observation  that  a  majority  of 
patients  are  asymptomatic  and  do  not  get  diagnosed  in  their  lifetime.  In 
contrast, a recent analysis of the US claims database showed a prevalence of 
clinically established HCM of only approximately 1:3,000 (0.03%). Thus, the 
number of patients with HCM who are diagnosed are much smaller, suggesting 
that most patients  with  HCM  experience a normal  life  span  without  limiting 
symptoms or the need for major treatments.
Prevalence of obstructive HCM
Estimates  of  the  proportion  of  the  HCM  population  with  oHCM  range  from 
22%  to  70%.  Javidonbadi  et  al.  was  the  only  study  to  report  on  oHCM 
specifically: 251 per 1.6 million or 1.6 per 10,000. In this study, only 22% of 
the HCM patients had oHCM.6
In summary, taking all mentioned prevalence studies above, and assuming an 
approximate  70%  proportion  of  patients  with  HCM  have  the  obstructive 
phenotype, prevalence of symptomatic oHCM in the adult population is below 
approximately 5 in 10,000.

Note:  Javidonbadi  et  al.  was  the  only  study  to  report  on  oHCM  specifically,  with  a 
prevalence of 251 per 1.6 million or 1.6 in 10,000. None of studies have distinguished 
between the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic HCM or oHCM.  
Median age at diagnosis of symptomatic oHCM is 47 years. Many studies show 
an age-related prevalence, with much lower rates in patients diagnosed under 
the age of 25 years. Prevalence of oHCM has been shown to increase with age; 
patients  with  HCM  of  more  advanced  age,  beyond  mid-life,  are  being 
increasingly recognized due to heightened index of suspicion for this disease 
and increased penetration of advanced cardiac imaging into practice.
Husser et al,1 demonstrated in the German population, the prevalence increased 
from 7.4 per 100,000 persons (95% CI 5.2–10.1) in 0 to 9 years old to 298.7 
per 100,000 persons (95% CI 276.4–322.4) in patients > 80 years. In all age 
categories,  men  had  a  numerically  higher  prevalence  than  women  with 
significant differences in patients > 30 years. In the Cardiomyopathy Registry 
of the EURObservational Research Programme, the mean age of diagnosis was 
47 years, with the 25th percentile and 75th percentiles at 33 and 59 years of 
age, respectively. Thus, using these data, and assuming an approximate 70% 
proportion of patients with oHCM, prevalence can be estimated as 1 and 21 per 
10,000 (0 to 9 year old and > 80 years, respectively), throughout a wide age 
range.
In  pediatric  registries,  the  prevalence  of  HCM  in  children  is  unknown,  but 
population-based  studies  report  an  annual  incidence  of  0.3  to  0.5  per 
100,000.11,12
HCM  is  most  frequently  transmitted  as  an  autosomal  dominant  trait,  most 
studies report a  small male  preponderance  (60% men).  This  finding remains 
unexplained but might reflect bias in screening strategies as well as genetic and 
hormonal modifiers.13
The  prevalence  of  HCM  in  different  racial  groups  is  similar.  The  HCM 
phenotype appears comparable between black and white populations. Current 
management guidelines  for  oHCM  make  no  distinctions  based  on  racial  or 
ethnic background of patients14 and there is no evidence that disease-related 
genetic variants are more prevalent in the black population.15,16
Risk factors for the disease 
In up to 60% of adolescents and adults with HCM, the disease is an autosomal 
in  cardiac  sarcomere  protein
dominant 
trait  caused  by  mutations

genes.17,18,19,20,21 Twenty percent of patients with HCM have family history 
of SCD and 50% with evidence of familial disease.13
Five to ten percent of adult cases are caused by other genetic disorders
including inherited metabolic and neuromuscular diseases,
chromosome  abnormalities  and  genetic  syndromes22,23 Some  patients  have 
non-genetic  disorders  that  mimic  genetic  forms  of  the  disease,  for  example, 
senile transthyretin-related amyloidosis and AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin 
light chain amyloidosis).24,25
The  main  goals  of  pharmacological  therapy  in  HCM  relate  to  control  of 
symptoms  and  improvement  of  exercise  limitation, abolition  or reduction  of 
dynamic  intraventricular  gradients,  treatment  of  LV  dysfunction  and  HF, 
control of AF and ventricular arrhythmias, and prevention of cardioembolism.
26
Main treatment options 
for 
relief 
include 
tolerated  dose, 
The only medicinal products approved in Europe for use in the management of 
HCM  are  the  β-blockers  propranolol  and  nadolol.  However,  there are no 
targeted treatments or disease-modifying agents for HCM currently available. 
oHCM patients are prescribed a β-blocker as a first-line treatment titrated to 
the  maximally 
followed  by  a  non-dihydropyridine 
calcium-channel blocker or disopyramide.  
Pharmacotherapies 
β-blockers, 
symptomatic 
non-dihydropyridine  calcium-channel  blockers  (diltiazem  or  verapamil),  and 
disopyramide.  Surgical  interventions  are  options  for  those  patients  with  the 
most  severe  form  of  obstructed  HCM  (ie,  symptomatic  oHCM)  and  include 
alcohol septal ablation and septal myectomy.
Non-pharmacologic  therapies  include  septal  reduction  therapies  (surgical 
myectomy  or  alcohol  septal  ablation  therapy),  which  can  be  effective  in 
reducing obstruction and improving LV outflow, do not address the underlying 
myocardial  disease.  ICD,  which  may  be  an  option  used  to  prevent 
oHCM-related SCD, is also an invasive procedure, requiring specialized clinic 
settings, and may not be available to all patients.4,27
Studies identified from the literature review were generally supportive of the 
view  that  pharmacological  interventions  only  provide  variable  symptomatic 
relief to patients with HCM. No medical or surgical therapies have been shown 
to  have  a  disease-modifying  effect.  Medical  device  implants  (eg,  ICD) have 
contributed  to  a  decrease  in  mortality  based  on  their  treatment  of  malignant 
arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden death.
Mortality and morbidity (natural 
history)
Patients with HCM are often symptomatic with shortness of breath (on exertion 
or  at  rest),  fatigue,  chest  pain  and  reduced  exercise  tolerance28 that  impacts 
their daily lives. Among referral-based cohorts of patients with HCM, 30% to 
40%  will  experience  adverse  events,  including:  1)  sudden  death  events; 
2) progressive  limiting  symptoms  because  of  left  ventricular  outflow  tract 
obstruction or diastolic dysfunction; 3) HF symptoms associated with systolic 
dysfunction; and 4) AF with risk of thromboembolic stroke.29
Studies  reporting  relatively 
long-term  HCM  patient  outcomes  have 
demonstrated  that  for  patients  at  risk  for,  or  who  develop  one  of  these,

disease-related complications, the application of contemporary cardiovascular 
therapies  and 
to 
0.5%/year.30,31 One of the major treatment initiatives responsible for lowering 
mortality has been the evolution of SCD risk stratiﬁcation strategies based on 
a number of major noninvasive risk markers, which can identify adult patients 
with HCM at greatest risk for sudden death who are then candidates for ICD 
placement. The decrease in sudden death rates in HCM appears now to have 
shifted focus to HF as the predominant cause of disease-related morbidity and 
mortality and, therefore, greatest unmet treatment need in adults.
Data from SHaRe registry reported that the cumulative morbidity in HCM was 
dominated by complications related to HF and AF. Among patients diagnosed 
before 40 years of age, the risk of having HF or AF by age 60 year was 47% 
(95%  CI:  42-52)  and  62%  (95%  CI:  56-67),  respectively.  For  context,  a 
40-year-old in the US general population has a lifetime risk of 20% to 45% for 
HF  and  23%  to  26%  (women  and  men,  respectively)  for  AF.  SHaRe  also 
demonstrated that regardless of age at diagnosis, the majority of HCM-related 
complications occurred later in life, peaking between 50 and 70 years of age. 
Ventricular  arrhythmia  and  sudden  death  were  rare  in  those  diagnsed  at 
> 60 years  of  age  (2%  cumulative  incidence  in  SHaRe),  all  other  risks, 
including AF, HF, and overall mortality, were greatest in this age group.32
Mortality
Mortality associated with HCM is variable and can be up to 6% annually across
the  patient  population,  but  up  to  11%  per  year  in  patients  with  end  stage 
HCM.33,34 The risk of SCD ranges from 0.5% to 2% per year in adults with 
HCM,  and  HCM  is  the  most  common  cause  of  SCD  in  adolescents  and 
athletes.35 The 5-year risk for SCD as predicted by the ESC risk calculator is 
impacted by age, family history of SCD, history of syncope, and presence of 
non-sustained  ventricular  tachycardia  as  well  as  by  LVOT  gradient  and 
structural parameters (eg, left ventricular wall thickness and left atrial size).4
Preventative  measures  for  SCD  include  exercise  restriction,  anti-arrhythmic 
drugs and ICD.
Data from a large international cardiomyopathy registry (SHaRE) demonstrate 
that mortality in patients with HCM is significantly higher than in the general 
population.32 While  the  SHaRe  data  confirmed  that  absolute  mortality  in 
young patients with HCM is low compared to patients who were 50 years of 
age or older, it was 4-fold higher than expected for 20- to 29-year-olds without 
HCM. Prior natural history studies reported sudden cardiac death as the leading 
cause  of  mortality  in  HCM,  accounting  for  ~40%  of  deaths 36,37 data  from 
SHaRe indicated that 16% of deaths were sudden. Overall mortality in SHaRe 
was  driven  by  HF  and noncardiac  death,  both  of  which  were more  common 
than lethal arrhythmias, consistent with recent evidence from other cohorts. 
The reported rates of all-cause mortality and sudden death in a Europe based 
study was consistent with those reported in US-focused studies. A retrospective 
study in primarily adult patients with HCM evaluating a single center in Greece 
(N = 509; mean age: 51.0 years) between 1995 through 2014 reported a 7.1% 
all-cause mortality rate, 5.5% HCM-related death, 2.8% HF-related death rate,

and  2.2%  sudden  cardiac  death  rate.38 The  study  also  reported  that  AF  was 
associated with higher rates of all-cause (15.1%), HCM-related (12.6%), and 
HF-related (7.6%) mortality.
The key complications or comorbidities associated with HCM are AF, stroke, 
and HF. Variability in the reported frequencies of these adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes,  particularly  for  AF,  may  be  attributable  to  differences  in  patient 
demographics  (eg,  age)  and  clinical/disease  status  (eg,  newly  diagnosed  vs. 
progressed/severe patients who have experienced a hospitalization event). For 
HF,  differences  in  the  definition  and  classification  methodologies may  also 
have been a contributing factor.39,40
Reported  rates  of  AF  ranged  from  4%  (newly  diagnosed  patients)  to  33% 
(hospitalized patients). Reported rates of stroke ranged from 4% (multinational 
registry  study  of  patients  who  received  care  at  an  HCM  specialty  center)  to 
9.2% (hospitalized patients with HCM and AF). The rate of HF related events 
ranged from 15% (multinational registry in pregnant women) to 43% (natural 
history study in patients at a specialty center). A systematic literature review of 
studies published between 1996 through 2016 that described the prevalence of 
HF  among  children  and  adolescents  identified  one  study  reporting  a  13.5% 
prevalence rate for congestive HF in pediatric patients with HCM.41
A  recent  analysis  of  data  from  the  Cardiomyopathy  Registry  of  the 
EURObservational  Research  Program  (N  =  3,208;  1,739  with  HCM,  1,260 
with DCM, rest with other cardiomyopathies) based on adult patients enrolled 
from 2012 through 2016 reported that the majority of patients with HCM have 
NYHA Class II/III HF, with Class II being most common for each condition 
(Class II: 49.9% for HCM; Class III: 16.1% for HCM).13 Among patients with 
HCM (median age at enrollment: 55.0 years), 26.6% had a history of AF, 7.7% 
had  sustained  ventricular  tachycardia,  2.8%  had  resuscitated  ventricular 
fibrillation/cardiac  arrest,  3.4%  had  stroke,  and  9.5%  had  atrioventricular 
block.  Reported  rates  of  AF  and  stroke  in  HCM  were  comparable  to  those 
reported in US-based studies.
Pujades-Rodriguez et al. identified all HCM patients in a UK-based, linked data 
system covering 3 million lives and matched them to non HCM patients. The 
study demonstrated that patients with HCM had a significantly higher risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death, heart failure, AF, 
myocardial infarction, and cardiac revascularization.7
Two  recent  US-based  retrospective  studies  reported  on  predictors  of  death, 
which  included  being  female,  NYHA Class  III/IV HF,  burned  out  HCM 
(defined  as  having  EF  ≤  50%),  and  having  AF,  coronary  artery  disease, 
hypertension, or stroke.42
Although  HCM  tends to  be  more  common  in males,  female  patients  tend  to 
have  more  severe  symptoms  and  be  at  higher  risk  of  adverse  outcomes 
including  death.43 Recent  studies  have  also  shown  that  patients  with  HCM 
with  pathogenic/likely  pathogenic  mutations  in  sarcomeric  genes  may  be  at 
higher  risk  for  adverse  cardiovascular  outcomes,  such  as  death,  HF,  and 
arrhythmias. Pathogenic mutations in MYH7 may confer a particularly severe

Developmental toxicity
All cardiac toxicities in non-clinical studies, including echocardiographic findings, 
reduction in systolic performance, cardiac dilation, cardiac inflammation, death, 
and metaplasia, as well as increased heart weights in rats and QTc prolongation in 
dogs,  were  considered  secondary  to  exaggerated  mavacamten  pharmacology. 
Toxicities (eg, edema and/or congestion) observed in other tissues, including lung, 
liver, pancreas, and pleural cavity, were secondary to decreased cardiac function.
Plasma exposures (AUC) at the no effect doses for adverse effects in rats and dogs 
were less than those in humans at the RHD.
A  study  evaluating the  effects  of  mavacamten  on mating  performance,  fertility, 
and early embryonic development in male and female rats showed no effects on 
these  parameters  at  doses  up  to  1.2  mg/kg/day. Plasma  exposure  (AUC)  of 
mavacamten at the highest dose tested was less than in humans at RHD.
In  a  pre/postnatal  development  study,  mavacamten  was  administered  orally  to 
pregnant  rats  (0,  0.3,  0.75,  and  1.5 mg/kg/day)  from  gestation  Day  6  to 
lactation/postpartum Day  20.  No  adverse  effects  were  observed  in  the  dams  or 
offspring exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through lactation. The dosage 
of  1.5  mg/kg/day  (the  highest  dosage level  tested)  was  considered  to  be  the
NOAEL for F0 maternal systemic toxicity, F1 neonatal/developmental toxicity, F1 
parental  systemic  toxicity,  F1  reproductive  toxicity,  and  F2  embryonic  toxicity 
when mavacamten was administered orally (by gavage) to Crl:CD(SD) rats. The 
maternal exposure at the NOAEL was inferred from the rat developmental toxicity 
study dosed at the same level and was less than the RHD.
When  mavacamten  was  administered  orally  to  pregnant  rats  (0.0,  0.3,  0.75,  or 
1.5 mg/kg/day)  during  the  period  of  organogenesis,  post  implantation  loss, 
decreased  mean  foetal body  weight,  and  foetal malformations  (visceral  and 
skeletal)  were  increased  in  the  high  dose  group.  Visceral  malformations  (heart 
malformation  in  fetuses,  including  one  total  situs  inversus)  and  increased 
incidences  of  skeletal  malformations  (mainly  fused  sternebrae)  were  observed. 
Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no effect dose for embryo-foetal development in 
rats is less than those in humans at the RHD.  
When mavacamten was administered orally to pregnant rabbits (0.0, 0.6, 1.2, or 
2.0 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis, foetal malformations (visceral 
and  skeletal)  were  increased  at  doses  of  1.2  mg/kg/day  and  higher.  Visceral 
findings consisted of great vessels malformations (dilatation of pulmonary trunk 
and/or  aortic  arch)  noted  in  4  fetuses  from  4  litters  at  2 mg/kg/day.  Skeletal 
malformations consisted of higher incidences of fused sternebrae (38 fetuses from

embryo-foetal development  in rabbits  is less  than those  in humans at  the  RHD. 
Based  on  the  developmental  findings  in  rats  and  rabbits,  strict  use  of  effective 
contraceptive methods were required of study participants; pregnancy or plans to 
become pregnant were an exclusion criteria for the mavacamten clinical trials. 
No nephrotoxicity was observed.
Hepatotoxicity  observed  in  preclinical  dog  or  rat  studies  was  secondary  to 
decreased  cardiac  function  and  passive  venous  congestion  and  necrosis  in  the 
centrilobular region because of venous hypertension. No direct hepatotoxicity was 
observed in any rat or dog study.
Mavacamten  was  not  found  to  be  genotoxic  in  reverse  mutation  bacterial  test 
(Ames test), human in vitro lymphocyte clastogenicity, or rat in vivo micronucleus 
assays.
Mavacamten was not carcinogenic in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study at 
doses of up to 2.0 mg/kg/day in males and 3.0 mg/kg/day in females or in a 2-year
rat  carcinogenicity  study  at  doses  up  to  0.6 mg/kg/day  in male  and  female rats. 
Exposures  at  the  high  doses  in  mice  and  rats  were  up  to  3-fold  or  0.2-fold, 
respectively, compared to the RHD.
In a 39-week toxicology study in dogs, there was prolongation of the QTc interval. 
No central nervous system adverse effects were noted in preclinical studies.
No adverse effects were noted other than those related to the heart in preclinical 
studies.
Metabolism  by  CYP2C19  is  the  predominant  mechanism  of  clearance  of 
mavacamten;  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C9  are  also 
in  mavacamten 
metabolism.  CYP2C19 accounts  for  74% of mavacamten metabolism, CYP3A4
for 18%, and CYP2C9 for 7.6%.
Mavacamten Effect on CYP3A4:
In vitro data suggests that mavacamten may be an inducer of CYP3A4. 
Mavacamten Effect on Other CYP 450 Isoenzymes:
Mavacamten does not appear to be an inhibitor of CYP 450 isoenzymes and is 
neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of major drug efflux or uptake transporters.

The observed on target- effect of 
mavacamten is a decrease in 
cardiac contractility, measured as 
a decrease in LVEF. Based on
PK/PD modeling that was used 
for dose selection in 
MYK-461-005 
(EXPLORER-HCM), a decrease 
in LVEF of 5-10% was 
anticipated; therefore, patients 
with an LVEF at the lower end of 
normal were excluded. Also, 
LVEF < 50% was used as a 
criterion for temporary 
discontinuation.  
Patients with NYHA Class IV 
either have or are at risk of LV 
systolic dysfunction, may be 
considered candidates for SRT, 
and would be unable to 
adequately perform CPET. 
Patients with NYHA Class IV 
were excluded from the pivotal 
study, MYK-461-005.
Mavacamten has shown 
teratogenic potential in preclinical

Reason for exclusion
storage disorders, characterized 
by either extracellular infiltration 
of the myocyte or intramyocardial 
deposits, and have other specific 
treatments. Mavacamten has not 
been studied in patients with 
phenocopy diseases that mimic 
oHCM (such as Fabry disease, 
amyloidosis, and Noonan 
syndrome with LV hypertrophy), 
nor is the mechanism of action 
targeted at these diseases.
Patients with infiltrative or 
storage diseases of the heart may 
present with clinical syndromes 
that phenotypically mimic oHCM 
and may demonstrate LV 
hypertrophy on echocardiogram. 
However, these patients are not 
expected to benefit from 
treatment with mavacamten as the 
underlying pathophysiology of 
these diseases differs from HCM 
and, in some cases, other 
therapies exist (eg, Fabry and 
amyloidosis).
Maximal stress testing as a study 
requirement may increase the risk 
of arrhythmias in patients who are 
already at high risk for the 
development of syncope and/or 
serious, life-threatening cardiac 
arrhythmia.  
Symptom-limited cardiac exercise 
stress testing was a primary 
endpoint in MYK-461-005. These 
patients were excluded from the 
MYK-461-005 to minimise risk 
during exercise, as there is higher 
chance for the patients with 
medical history of syncope or 
ventricular tachycardia to 
experience these events with 
exercise.

Following a single 25 mg dose of 
14C labeled mavacamten, 85% of 
the total radioactivity was 
recovered in urine. Only 2% was 
in the form of parent drug. 
Therefore, subjects with mild and 
moderate renal impairment 
(eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
were included in Study 
MYK-461-005. Patients with 
severe renal impairment have not 
been studied during the 
mavacamten clinical program.
At the time Study MYK-461-005 
was designed, mavacamten had 
not yet been studied in patients 
with hepatic impairment. Patients 
with severe hepatic impairment
(Child-Pugh class C) were 
excluded from the study to ensure 
their safety.
Based on study results, patients 
on these medications (potent or 
mild CYP2C19 inhibitors; and 
potentially strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors especially in CYP2C19
poor metabolizers) may 
experience DDIs; therefore, they 
were excluded during clinical 
trials.

Patients with documented 
paroxysmal/intermittent AF could 
have difficulty performing CPET 
and could pose the risk of cardiac 
adverse events occurring. AF can 
also interfere with accurate 
reading of CPET,

cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance.
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
dose adjustment of 
mavacamten due to 
increased exposures.
SmPC provides 
information on the 
metabolism of 
mavacamten primarily 
through CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 enzymes.
Prescribers will assess for 
drug-drug interactions 
with medicines affecting 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 
activity.
Cardiologists who will 
prescribe mavacamten are 
well versed in the standard 
of care management of 
patients with permanent or 
persistent AF and there is 
no reason to expect an 
increase in 
thromboembolic events 
based on the 
pharmacology of 
mavacamten. Patients with 
persistent or permanent 
AF who are anticoagulated 
and adequately 
rate-controlled were 
allowed in Study 
MYK-461-005.
There is no anticipated 
difference in the safety 
profile of mavacamten in 
patients with 
paroxysmal/intermittent 
atrial fibrillation.

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as  those  that  are  rare  or  caused  by  long  latency,  cumulative  effects  and limited prolonged 
mavacamten exposure (> 18 months). Continuing clinical development and safety monitoring will 
support  the  identification  of  new  adverse  reactions  related  to  mavacamten. Consequently,
long-term safety including detrimental CV effects is considered missing information.

insufficient to conclude a causal association for heart failure although a 
contributory role of mavacamten cannot be ruled out. Excessive and/or

Mavacamten exposures (AUC) increase by about 2-fold when it is taken 
with moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors and 3.4-fold with strong CYP2C19 
inhibition  as  demonstrated  in  poor  CYP2C19  healthy  volunteer 
metabolizers. Higher mavacamten concentrations may contribute to new 
events  of  heart  failure  due  to  systolic  dysfunction  or  make  it  more 
difficult to control. Other adverse events may also manifest.
Mavacamten may cause foetal harm in humans based on animal studies. 
No clinical data exists on the safety of mavacamten during pregnancy in 
humans.
Subjects with NYHA Class IV were not included in Study MYK-461-005 
due to limited experience available with mavacamten at the time the study 
was  conducted. There  are  limited  data  in  NYHA  Class  IV  patients  in
Study MYK-461-017 (only 1 patient enrolled).
Patients  on  disopyramide  were  excluded  from  the  pivotal  study
(MYK-461-005) pending  further  understanding  of  the  safety  profile  of 
mavacamten in the indicated treatment population. There are limited data 
available  from  Study MYK-461-017.  In  Study  MYK-461-017,  the
efficacy  and  safety  results  of  patients  receiving  mavacamten  and 
disopyramide were similar to those not receiving disopyramide. There is 
limited  information  available  on  the  potential  for  a  PD  interaction 
between  mavacamten  and  other  substances  that  also  reduce  cardiac 
contractility.
Therapy with a β-blocker or either diltiazem or verapamil as monotherapy 
was allowed in Study MYK-461-005 if the subject was on a stable dose 
of one of these agents, and no dose adjustment was anticipated during the 
course of the study. However, combination therapy  was not allowed in 
Study MYK-461-005 pending a better understanding of the safety profile 
of  mavacamten  in  oHCM. There  are  limited  data  on  combination 
therapies in Study MYK-461-017. In Study MYK-461-017, the efficacy 
and safety results of patients receiving mavacamten in combination with 
β-blockers  and  nondihydropyridine calcium-channel  blockers were 
similar to those receiving mavacamten monotherapy.
Mavacamten  is intended as a chronic therapy for patients with oHCM. 
In  the  oHCM  clinical  development  program,  260 oHCM  patients were 
exposed  to  mavacamten for  periods  up  to 30 months.  57 patients  have 
been  exposed  to  mavacamten  for  ≥ 12  to  18 months,  84 patients  have 
been exposed for ≥ 18 to 24 months, 50 patients have been exposed for
≥ 24 to 30 months, and 27 patients have been exposed for > 30 months.

Potential mechanisms 
Evidence source and strength of evidence 
Characterization of risk 
Mavacamten  is  a  cardiac  myosin  inhibitor  that  reduces 
myocardial  contractility. This  mechanism  leads  to  a 
reduction in LVEF which is expected and generally  well 
tolerated.  Systolic  dysfunction  due  to  an  excessive 
reduction  in  LVEF  (ie,  <  50%) may  be  asymptomatic  or 
result in heart failure.
Systolic  dysfunction  (reversible)  has  been  reported  in 
mavacamten clinical trials.
Heart  failure  due  to systolic  dysfunction  represents  a 
clinical  outcome  of  an  exaggerated  on-target  effect 
(excessive  decrease 
in  myocardial  contractility)  of 
mavacamten  that has  been  seen  alone  or  in  combination 
(eg,  uncontrolled  atrial 
with 
fibrillation,  serious  infection,  stress  cardiomyopathy)  in 
clinical trials. Systolic dysfunction has been reversible in 
the  clinical  program  upon  dose  discontinuation  and 
down-titration.  Excessive  or  prolonged  reduction  in 
ejection fraction can be life-threatening.
The  clinical  data  are  insufficient  to  conclude  a  causal 
association between mavacamten use and heart failure due 
to systolic dysfunction.
intercurrent 
illnesses 
In  the  pivotal  RCT  EXPLORER,  MYK-461-005,  the 
incidence of cardiac failure in the mavacamten treatment 
arm (2.4%) is overall lower than the incidence of cardiac 
failure in the placebo treatment arm (3.9%). Therefore, due 
to  a lack of  imbalance  between  these  2 treatment  groups
(see  Table  1),  heart  failure  is  not  considered  as  an 
identified risk.
Decreases  in  LVEF  <50%  did  not  consistently  correlate 
with  mavacamten  concentrations  exceeding  therapeutic 
levels. Also, patients with reduced LVEF <50% ranged in

History  of  significant

identified  as  prior  risk  factors  for  developing  systolic 
dysfunction leading to heart failure.
Intercurrent  events  of  stress  cardiomyopathy,  atrial 
fibrillation,  infection,  arrhythmias  with  rapid  ventricular

may  contribute  to  new  events  of  systolic  dysfunction, 
which may lead to heart failure or make it more difficult to

Prior  to  initiating  (or  during)  mavacamten  therapy, 
reducing  the  risk  of  arrhythmias  in  patients  who  are 
already  at  high  risk  for  the  development  of  serious, 
life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, adequate rate control 
of  atrial 
treatment  of 
underlying  infections,  and  careful,  step-wise,  dose  up 
titration during the dose adjustment period, are approaches 
that can be taken to reduce the incidence and/or severity of 
potential systolic dysfunction.
Dose adjustment should be based on HCM symptoms and 
Valsalva LVOT gradient, and LVEF should be maintained 
above 50%. LVEF should be assessed 4 weeks after any 
new dose level.
LVEF should  be  monitored  at  treatment  initiation  and  4
weeks 
following  any  dose  adjustment.  Once  an 
individualised  maintenance  dose  is  achieved,  patients 
should  be  assessed  every  12  weeks.  If  at  any  visit  the 
patient’s  LVEF  declines  below  50%,  dosing  with 
mavacamten should be interrupted for 4 weeks until LVEF 
returns to ≥ 50%. 
Consider  assessing  LVEF  for  patients  with  a  serious 
intercurrent  illness  such  as  infection  or  arrythmia  (eg,
atrial fibrillation or uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia), as well 
as for signs of HF (eg, increased shortness of breath, leg 
swelling, etc.).
Events  that  occurred  in  association  with  mavacamten 
plasma  concentrations  in  the  highest  quartile  included 
SAEs  of  cardiac  failure  and  systolic  dysfunction,  and 
although  a  modest  reduction  in  LVEF  is  expected  with 
mavacamten  based  on  the  mechanism  of  action,  a 
contributory  role  for  excessive  pharmacodynamic  effects 
of  mavacamten  at  high  concentrations  is  biologically 
plausible.

Potential mechanisms 
Evidence source and strength of evidence 
Mavacamten  is  extensively  metabolized  primarily  through 
CYP2C19  (74%);  CYP3A4  (18%),  and  CYP2C9  (7.6%). 
Mavacamten exposures (AUC) increase by about 2-fold when 
it  is  taken  with  moderate  CYP2C19  inhibitors. Patients may 
also  be  subject  to  influence  by  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C19 
inhibitors, with the extent dependent on the enzyme inhibited 
and CYP2C19 metabolizer status resulting in elevated plasma 
concentrations  of  mavacamten. Poor  metabolizers  are  more 
strongly  influenced  by  modulators  of  CYP3A4,  while  rapid 
metabolizers  and  ultrarapid  metabolizers  are  more  strongly 
influenced  by  modulators  of  CYP2C19.  Higher  mavacamten 
concentrations  may  contribute  to  new  events  of  systolic 
dysfunction which may lead to heart failure.

The  mechanism  is  unknown.  There  has  been  no  observed 
exposure  to  mavacamten  during  human  pregnancies.  It  is 
assumed  that  susceptibility  to  teratogenicity  in  humans  may 
mirror that seen in animals.
Nonclinical  developmental  toxicity  study  findings  were 
suggestive  of  a  teratogenic  potential  of  mavacamten  at 
therapeutic exposures.
Mavacamten may cause foetal harm in humans based on animal 
studies.  Teratogenicity  (cardiac/skeletal  malformations)  was 
observed  in  rat  and  rabbit  studies  at  maternal  exposures  less 
than  the  maximum  recommended  human  dose.  Decreased 
foetal body weight and increase in post implantation loss were 
also observed. 
The risk of embryo-foetal toxicity due to paternal exposure in 
semen  was  assessed  based  on  preclinical  data,  actual  semen 
concentrations in healthy men volunteers, and the potential for 
these  concentration 
to  cause  maternal  systemic 
exposures that could be teratogenic. Based on measurements of 
mavacamten in semen of 4 male subjects who received 18.5 mg 
mavacamten  for  28  days,  it  was  concluded  that  the  risk  of 
teratogenic  effects  caused  by  mavacamten  transferred  by 
semen or other body fluids is negligible.
No  clinical  data  exists  on  the  safety  of  mavacamten  during 
human pregnancy.

Females  of  childbearing  potential  who  are  not  using  highly

Mavacamten  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in 
women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective 
contraception.  Oral  contraceptives  are  safe  to  use  while  on 
mavacamten (Study MYK-461-010) as their metabolism is not 
significantly  affected  by  mavacamten. Before  initiation  of 
treatment, women of childbearing potential must be informed 
of this risk to the foetus, must have a negative pregnancy test 
and must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
6 months  after  treatment  discontinuation. If  a  patient

suspected  to  be  pregnant,  mavacamten  must  be  interrupted 
until pregnancy is excluded. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product  This  important  potential  risk  may have  impact  on  the

Disopyramide  is  allowed  in  the  ongoing  MYK-461-

in  combination  with  β-blockers  and 
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel  blockers were 
similar to those receiving mavacamten monotherapy.
In  clinical  studies, mavacamten has  been administered 
to 260 oHCM patients for periods up to 30 months. In 
the  oHCM  clinical  development  program,  57 patients 
to  mavacamten  for  ≥ 12 to 
have  been  exposed 
18 months, 84 patients have  been  exposed  for  ≥ 18 to 
24 months, 50 patients have been exposed  for ≥ 24 to 
30 months, and 27 patients have been exposed for > 30 
months; therefore, the adverse effects following longer 
term  treatment  with  mavacamten  are  still  accruing  to 
provide  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  data,  and  to 
provide  additional  data  on  CV  risk,  and  MACE  in 
particular. To date, no known mavacamten adverse drug 
reactions  that  have  a  long  latency,  or  are  due  to 
prolonged  exposure,  or  are  due  to  cumulative  effects 
have been identified.
While the development program showed mavacamten to 
have a positive benefit-risk profile, there is no evidence 
to suggest  that  mavacamten  causes  CV  detriment. 
Long-term  safety  including  detrimental  CV  effects  is 
considered missing information because long-term data 
are limited.
Lactating  women  are  excluded  from  the  mavacamten 
clinical studies. There have been no reports of lactation 
exposure  in  female  subjects  treated  with  mavacamten 
thus far in the clinical program. It is unknown whether 
mavacamten  or  its  metabolites  are  excreted  in  human 
milk. Because  of  the  unknown  adverse  effects  of 
mavacamten  in  breastfed  newborns/infants,  women 
must not breast-feed during treatment with mavacamten.
Mavacamten is extensively metabolized, predominately 
by  CYP2C19  (74%).  Mavacamten  terminal half-life  is 
increased  from  6-9  days  in  normal  metabolizers  to  23 
days in poor CYP2C19 metabolizers. There are limited 
data  on  the  safety  of  mavacamten  in  poor  CYP2C19 
metabolizers in clinical studies.

The  following  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  are  not  considered  PASS  per  definition 
(GVP Module VIII), and are included in Table 3.3-1 under Category 3. These studies are detailed 
below:
Planned Meta-analysis to assess CV outcome safety
A meta-analysis of Phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized studies of mavacamten 
in patients with symptomatic HCM will be conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular safety profile 
of mavacamten. 
The meta-analysis will assess CV safety based on a composite endpoint of time to first occurrence 
of MACE meta-analysis event, where a MACE meta-analysis event is defined as an event of CV 
death,  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke,  CV  hospitalization,  hospitalization  for 
heart failure, hospitalization for arrhythmia, or ICD therapy.
It  will  include  three  clinical  trials  in  the  symptomatic  oHCM  population  (EXPLORER-HCM, 
VALOR-HCM,  China  oHCM  phase  3  trial)  and  one  clinical  trial  in  the  symptomatic  nHCM 
population (ODYSSEY-HCM). The populations of EXPLORER-HCM, VALOR-HCM, and the 
China Phase 3 study  include symptomatic oHCM patients with  LVOT gradients at rest or with 
provocation (ie, Valsalva or exercise) ≥ 50 mmHg. The nHCM Phase 3 trial will enroll patients 
with provoked LVOT gradients < 50 mmHg and dose strengths tested, which will  be similar to 
those used in the oHCM program. Based on the mechanism of action of the drug and similarities 
in the  nature of the disease, co-morbidities  and events, this representation of the  broader HCM 
patient population is considered appropriate for this purpose of CV risk determination.
MYK-461-007/CV027003 (MAVA-LTE):  A  Long-term  Safety  Extension  Study  of 
Mavacamten  in  Adults  with  Hypertrophic  Cardiomyopathy  Who  Have  Completed 
MAVERICK-HCM (MYK-461-006) or EXPLORER-HCM (MYK-461-005)
This is an ongoing, multicenter, dose-blinded, extension study evaluating the long-term safety and 
tolerability  of  mavacamten  in  subjects  with  symptomatic  oHCM  who  completed  the  Phase  3 
EXPLORER-HCM  study  through  Week  38  (EXPLORER-LTE  Cohort)  and  in  subjects  with 
symptomatic  nHCM  who  completed  the  Phase  2  MAVERICK-HCM  study  through  Week  24

controlled  Study  to  Evaluate  Mavacamten  in  Adults  With  Symptomatic  Obstructive 
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Who Are Eligible for Septal Reduction Therapy
This  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multi-center  study  in  the  US  that  will 
evaluate the effect of mavacamten treatment on reducing the number of SRT procedures performed 
in subjects with symptomatic obstructive  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM [also known as 
HOCM]) who are eligible for SRT based on ACCF/AHA 2011 and/or ESC 2014 guideline.
Although,  the  VALOR-HCM  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  period  (Day1  to  Week  16)  was 
completed and reported in the submitted primary CSR, the study is ongoing. Cumulative LTFU 
data from this ongoing study will continue to inform the mavacamten safety profile.

mavacamten
At Week 16, subjects in the mavacamten group continued to receive mavacamten treatment at the 
dose they were receiving at the end of the double-blind period, and subjects in the placebo group 
cross over and start mavacamten dosing with dose adjustments per the recommended mavacamten 
dose titration regimen from Week 16 until Week 32 with echocardiograms every 4 weeks. After 
the Week  32 assessments,  all subjects  continue  once daily  mavacamten dosing  until the  end  of 
study (Week 128). LTFU is used to describe any event that occurs from first day of mavacamten 
treatment. Safety and efficacy results for the LTFU are reported in terms of cumulative number of 
weeks of  mavacamten exposure where  mavacamten treatment begins on Day 1  for those in the 
original mavacamten arm and Week 16 for those in the original placebo arm; therefore, LTFU data 
are inclusive of data in the double-blind period for subjects previously in the mavacamten arm that 
continue treatment during the ongoing LTFU. LTFU data will continue to be analyzed until the 
end  of  study. The  LTFU  data  from the  study  will  contribute  to  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities.

This  is  an  observational,  multicenter  registry  of  prospectively  enrolled  adult  patients  with 
symptomatic (NYHA functional class II-IV) oHCM in the US and Puerto Rico and LVEF ≥ 55% 
at enrollment. The registry aims to recruit an estimated 50 sites in the US and Puerto Rico to enroll 
approximately 1,500 patients with oHCM including at least 700 patients initiating treatment with 
mavacamten at enrollment, once it is available. Enrollment is ongoing and is estimated to require 
two years.
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the incidence rate of new or worsening of HF

mavacamten resulting from interaction with CYP2C19 inhibitors in ultrapid 
and  intermediate  CYP2C19  metabolizers  and moderate  or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors  in  poor  and  normal  CYP2C19  metabolizers, and  embryo-foetal
toxicity.
Rationale for the additional risk minimsation activity:
The Checklist will support the communication of critical tasks and actions by 
the prescriber throughout the patient’s cycle of treatment with mavacamten; 
before  starting  treatment,  during  treatment,  and  after  treatment  has  been 
discontinued.
Target audience and planned distribution path:
Prescribers
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for 
success:
As part of routine pharmacovigilance practice, in the event of a mavacamten 
pregnancy exposure, a PSF will be used to obtain follow-up information. The 
PSF contains adequate elements concerning pregnancy exposure and outcome 
as well as potential exposure during breastfeeding.
Also, on a regular basis, signal detection will be performed as part of routine 
pharmacovigilance  monitoring,  to  monitor  any  changes  in  the  occurrence, 
nature, and outcome of the important safety concerns including heart failure 
due  to  systolic  dysfunction,  adverse  events  due  to  overexposure to 
mavacamten resulting from interaction with CYP2C19 inhibitors in ultrarapid 
and  intermediate  CYP2C19  metabolizers  and  moderate  or  strong CYP3A4

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for CAMZYOS (mavacamten)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for CAMZYOS The RMP details important 
risks  of  CAMZYOS,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be 
obtained about CAMZYOS's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
CAMZYOS's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and  its package  leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how CAMZYOS should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for CAMZYOS should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of CAMZYOS's 
RMP.
I.  The medicine and what it is used for
CAMZYOS is authorised for the treatment of symptomatic (New York Heart Association, NYHA, 
class II-III) obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) in adult patients (see SmPC for the 
full  indication).  It  contains  mavacamten as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by  oral 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of CAMZYOS’s benefits can be found in CAMZYOS’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the
medicine’s 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/what-we-publish-
when/european-public-assessment-reports-background-context.
webpage: 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of CAMZYOS, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about CAMZYOS's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use, in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.

Version 2.0
mavacamten
In  the  case of  CAMZYOS, these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) assessment, so 
that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of CAMZYOS is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  CAMZYOS are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of CAMZYOS. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected  (eg, on  the
long-term use of the medicine).

mavacamten
Systolic dysfunction (reversible) has been reported in mavacamten clinical 
trials.
Heart  failure  due to systolic  dysfunction represents  a  clinical  outcome  of  an 
exaggerated on-target effect (excessive decrease in myocardial contractility) of 
mavacamten  that  has  been  seen  alone  or  in  combination  with  intercurrent 
illnesses  (eg,  uncontrolled  atrial  fibrillation,  serious 
infection,  stress 
cardiomyopathy) in clinical trials. Systolic dysfunction has been reversible in 
the clinical program upon dose discontinuation and down titration. Excessive 
or prolonged reduction in ejection fraction can be life-threatening.
History of significant ischemic events, history of arrhythmias, and history of 
systolic dysfunction are identified as prior risk factors for developing systolic 
dysfunction leading to heart failure.
Intercurrent events of stress cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, infection, 
arrhythmias with rapid ventricular rate, ischemia, and higher mavacamten 
concentrations may contribute to new events of systolic dysfunction or make 
it more difficult to control.
Drug-drug  interactions  with  CYP2C19  inhibitors  or  moderate  or  strong
CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Pharmacokinetic parameters from in vitro studies, population PK modeling and 
drug  interaction  studies  in  healthy  volunteers,  demonstrated  metabolism 
largely by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and increased mavacamten concentrations 
in the presence of CYP2C19 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
In  the  pivotal  EXPLORER  study, 7  (6%)  subjects  in the mavacamten  group 
and 2 (2%) subjects in the placebo group experienced reversible reductions in 
left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF) to  < 50%  (median  48%:  range 
35-49%) while on treatment. Among 7 subjects in the mavacamten group with 
on-treatment LVEF reduction to < 50%, concentration levels were not highly 
correlated with the changes (eg, 4 of 7 events of LVEF < 50% occurred with 
mavacamten  plasma  concentrations  <  700  ng/mL,  and  3  of  7  occurred  with 
mavacamten  concentrations  >  700  ng/mL).  Therefore,  elevation  in  plasma 
concentration did not consistently precede changes in LVEF.
In  all  7  patients  treated  with  mavacamten,  LVEF  recovered  following 
interruption of mavacamten and none of them were associated with an event of 
heart failure.
Patients  who  may  be  receiving  CYP2C19  or moderate  or strong  CYP3A4 
inhibitors  (prescription  drugs,  over  the  counter  [OTC]  medications,  herbal 
products). CYP2C19  poor  metabolizers may  have  increased  mavacamten 
expsoures  (up  to  3  times)  that  can  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of  systolic 
dysfunction compared to normal metabolizers.

Observational Study in Europe
The primary objectives of this study are to:




Estimate  the  incidence  rate  of  heart  failure  with  systolic  dysfunction 
(defined  as  worsening  symptomatic status  with LVEF <50%)  among 
adult patients with oHCM who received mavacamten or non-mavacamten 
treatment during the study period.
Estimate  the incidence rate  of  heart  failure  with  systolic  dysfunction 
among  adult  patients  with  oHCM  who  received mavacamten or 
non-mavacamten treatment during the study period - AND - who received 
a  concomitant  CYP2C19  inhibitor and/or moderate  or  strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors.
Estimate the incidence rate of MACE; a composite endpoint consisting 
of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization due to heart failure, 
and cardiovascular mortality, of the individual components of MACE and 
of  all-cause  mortality  among  adult  patients  with  oHCM  who  received 
mavacamten or non-mavacamten treatment during the study period.
Estimate the  incidence rate  of arrhythmia  (defined as atrial fibrillation, 
atrial  flutter,  sustained  ventricular  tachycardia,  and/or  ventricular 
arrhythmia) among adult patients with oHCM who received mavacamten 
or non-mavacamten treatment during the study period. 
 Compare the risk of heart failure with systolic dysfunction, of MACE (as 
composite  endpoint  and  individual  component  endpoints),  of  allcause 
mortality,  and  of  arrhythmia  among  adult  patients  with  oHCM  who 
received  mavacamten  to  those  patients  who  received  non-mavacamten 
treatment. 
The secondary objectives of this study are to:

Estimate the incidence rate of heart failure with systolic dysfunction, of 
MACE (as  composite  endpoint  and  individual  endpoints), of  all-cause 
mortality,  and  of arrhythmia  among  adult  patients  with  oHCM  who

Rationale and study objectives
received  mavacamten  during  the  study  period  - AND  - who  had 
concomitant  use  of  single  or  combination  use  of  the  following 
medications:
disopyramide and/or
β-blockers  and/or non-dihydropyridine  calcium-channel  blockers 
(verapamil/diltiazem)
 Assess  changes  in  clinical  responses  from  baseline  (as  measured  by 
changes in NYHA class, LVOT gradient, LVEF, and N-terminal-pro B-
type natriuretic peptide (BNP) at select time points for adult patients with 
oHCM who received mavacamten or non-mavacamten treatment during 
the study period.
The exploratory objective of this study is to:
 Assess the primary and secondary objectives in a subset of adult patients 
with  oHCM  - AND  - NYHA  Class  IV  functional  classification  and 
preserved LVEF (>55%) at baseline who received mavacamten or non-
mavacamten treatment during the study period.
A  meta-analysis  of  Phase  3  placebo-controlled,  double-blind, randomized 
studies of mavacamten in patients with symptomatic HCM, will be conducted 
to evaluate the cardiovascular safety profile.
The primary endpoint is a composite defined as time from first randomized 
dose to the first occurrence of a MACE meta-analysis event, where a MACE 
meta-analysis event is defined as an event of CV death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, CV hospitalization, hospitalization for heart 
failure (HF), hospitalization for arrhythmia, or ICD therapy.  
Four  clinical  trials  met  the  selection  criteria  to  be  included  in  the  meta-
analysis,  three  in  the  symptomatic  oHCM  population  (EXPLORER-HCM, 
VALOR-HCM, and China phase 3 trial) and one in the symptomatic nHCM 
population (ODYSSEY-HCM).
The primary objective of this study is as follows:
• To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of mavacamten in participants 
with  HCM previously  enrolled  in  1  of  2  placebo-controlled  trials: 
MAVERICK  HCM  for  non-obstructive  HCM  (nHCM)  and  EXPLORER 
HCM for obstructive HCM (oHCM)
The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:
•  To  assess  the  long-term  effects  of  mavacamten  on  symptoms  and 
echocardiographic measures of cardiac function
• To assess left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction as determined 
by Doppler echocardiography in the EXPLORER-LTE Cohort
The exploratory objective of this study was as follows:
• To assess the long-term effects of mavacamten on disease biomarker
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in 
the United States (U.S.) that will evaluate the effect of mavacamten treatment 
on  reducing  the  number  of  septal  reduction  therapy  (SRT)  procedures 
performed

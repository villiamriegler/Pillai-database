Part VI:  Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Exviera 
This is a summary of the RMP for Exviera (Dasabuvir).  The RMP details important 
risks of Exviera, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about Exviera's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Exviera's SmPC and its package leaflet (PIL) give essential information to HCPs and 
patients on how Exviera should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Exviera should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all of which are part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Exviera's RMP. 
I  The Medicine and What it Is Used For 
Exviera is indicated for use in combination with other medicinal products for the 
treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults (see SmPC for the full indication).  It 
contains dasabuvir as the active substance and it is given by oral route of 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Exviera's benefits can be found in 
Exviera's EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine's webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/exviera. 
II  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or 
Further Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Exviera, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Exviera's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the PIL and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
Important advice on the medicine's packaging; 
• 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine's legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Exviera is not yet available, 
it is listed under "missing information" below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Exviera are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
Exviera.  Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine). 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important identified 
risks 
Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure in patients 
with cirrhosis. 
Important potential 
risks 
Depression and suicide 
Hepatotoxicity among non-users of ethinyl estradiol-
containing medications 
Lack of efficacy/Risk of resistance development 
Missing information  None. 
II.B  Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified Risk - Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure 
in patients with cirrhosis. 
 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Clinical trial data 
Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation and 
hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal 
outcomes, have been reported. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
and advanced liver disease including cirrhosis. 
Risk minimization 
measures 
•  SmPC section 4.2 - Posology and method of 
administration: Exviera should not be used in 
patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).  Exviera is 
administered with Viekirax which is 
contraindicated in patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). 
•  Patient Information Label (PIL) Section 2 - what 
you need to know before you take Exviera 
provides information on signs of worsening liver 
problems. 
•  Monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms of 
hepatic decompensation included in SmPC 
section 4.4 
•  Prescription only medicine. 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialists. 
•  Pack size. 
Important potential risk - Depression and suicide 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Postmarketing data. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk groups may include HCV patients with prior 
medical histories of psychiatric conditions, including 
depression/major depression, bipolar disorder, 
anxiety, unspecified psychiatric conditions, or 
substance abuse. 
Risk minimization 
measures 
•  SmPC section 4.4 - Special warnings and 
precautions for use provides information on 
depression and suicide. 
•  SmPC section 4.8 - Undesirable effects. 
•  PIL Section 2 - What you need to know before 
you take Exviera. 
•  A recommendation for patients and caregivers to 
notify on mood changes and of any suicidal 
ideation per SmPC section 4.4. 
•  Prescription only medicine. 
•  Use of treatment should be initiated and

Risk minimization 
measures 
Off-label use, poor compliance, and medication 
errors (e.g., inappropriate schedule of drug 
administration) may result in suboptimal drug 
exposures that may lead to treatment failure.  For 
antiviral agents, this may lead to subsequent viral 
resistance development.

administration, includes information on dosage 
and duration of treatment for patients for 
genotype 1a, 1b and 4 pending cirrhotic status.

precautions on genotype specific activity, 
combination with other antiviral agents or 
retreatment.

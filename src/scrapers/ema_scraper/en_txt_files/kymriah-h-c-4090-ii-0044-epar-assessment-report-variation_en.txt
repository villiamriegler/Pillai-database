2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a systemic neoplasm of the lymphoid tissue displaying germinal centre 
(GC) B cell differentiation (Carbone, 2019). Tumorigenesis begins in precursor B cells and progresses 
until cells reach the GC maturation step. FL is preceded by an asymptomatic preclinical phase in which 
premalignant B cells carrying a t(14;18) chromosomal translocation accumulate additional genetic 
alterations, although not all of these cells progress to the tumour phase (Carbone, 2019). As it arises 
from B cells, FL is characterised by the expression of B-cell markers such as CD10, CD19, CD20, and 
CD22 (Swerdlow et al., 2016). FL is typically a slow-growing or indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(iNHL), and accounts for approximately 20% of all NHLs, and 70% of indolent lymphomas (Swerdlow 
et al, 2017). Nonetheless, it is considered an incurable, chronic disease in most cases, as it is 
characterised by a relapsing nature. PFS is progressively shorter for each subsequent treatment, 
decreasing from 6.6 years after first-line therapy to 1.5 and 0.83 years after second and third-line 
therapies, respectively (Link et al., 2019). Death generally occurs due to histological transformation to 
DLBCL or because FL becomes refractory to chemotherapy. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced 
disease during the sixth decade of their life, but approximately 25% of patients are ≤ 40 years of age 
(Jaglowski et al 2009). 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The initially claimed indication was: “Kymriah is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of therapy who are refractory, relapsed during or 
within 6 months after completion of anti-CD20 antibody maintenance, or relapsed after autologous 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)”  
Epidemiology  
The estimated number of new cases of FL in the EU was 12,117 in 2013 (RARECAREnet). In the US, 
there were 74200 cases of NHL (12688 cases of FL) in 2019, with approximately 19970 disease-
specific related deaths overall (SEER 2019). Immune suppression or auto-immune diseases, exposure

to herbicides and pesticides, and use of hair spray have been linked to the development of FL. The 
incidence is higher in industrialized countries than in developing countries, and higher in men than in 
women (Carbone et al 2019, Dada 2019). The aetiology of FL is unknown, but family history is thought 
to be important (Goldin et al., 2009).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most FL patients have widespread disease at diagnosis, with peripheral and central lymph node, 
spleen, and bone marrow involvement. Staging is carried out according to the Ann Arbor classification 
system, with mention of bulky disease (>6 cm) when applicable (Dreyling et al., 2021). Ann Arbor 
staging further classifies patients with lymphoma into A or B categories, where A is without B-
symptoms and B is with B-symptoms including unexplained fever of >38C, drenching night sweats or 
loss of >10% body weight within 6 months.  
Histological grading of FL is carried out on lymph node biopsies and reflects the average number of 
centroblasts/high-power field (HPF). Grade 1-2 cases have a marked predominance of centrocytes 
(small to medium-sized cleaved follicular center cells), with few centroblasts (large non-cleaved 
follicular center cells). FL Grades 3a and 3b both have >15 centroblasts/HPF. The two can be 
distinguished in that grade 3b displays sheets of blasts, while grade 3a has centroblasts with 
intermingled centrocytes (Ott et al., 2002; Dreyling et al., 2021). The clinical aggressiveness of FL 
increases with increasing numbers of centroblasts, and subsequently grades. While grade 1, 2 and 3a 
are considered indolent (low-grade) disease, FL grade 3b is at an intermediate stage of large cell 
transformation and usually considered an aggressive (high-grade) lymphoma (Dreyling, 2021). Hence, 
grade 3b FL differs from other forms of FL, with a clinical course similar to that of DLBCL. Biologically, 
grade 3b FL is more closely related to DLBCL than to the other forms of FL (Swerdlow, 2017). As such, 
FL grade 3b is treated as DLBCL in clinical practice. Histological transformation from indolent to more 
aggressive lymphoma, typically DLBCL, occurs at a rate of 2-3% per year (Freedman 2018). 
In terms of prognosis, a recent study found that for 80% of patients, overall survival was >10 years 
(Carbone, 2019), with another study finding a median survival of approximately 20 years (Tan et al 
2013). A retrospective multicenter study of FL patients found median survival to be 7.6 years after 
second-line therapy, and 4.8 years after third-line therapy, with a 10-year survival rate of only 20% 
after third-line treatment (Rivas-Delgado et al, 2019). Prognosis is strongly influenced by duration of 
response (DoR) to first-line chemoimmunotherapy, with the 20% of patients experiencing POD within 2 
years of initial chemoimmunotherapy exhibiting a 5 year OS of only 50% in one study (Casulo et al., 
2015). These patients are referred to as POD24.  
Another commonly used prognostic measure is the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 
(FLIPI) score, which incorporates five clinical factors (age, stage, serum hemoglobin level, number of 
nodes involved, and lactate dehydrogenase level) (Brice et al 1997, Solal-Céligny et al 2004). Inclusion 
of the mutational status of seven genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP and CARD11) 
along with the FLIPI score and ECOG Status led to the prognostic measure termed the m7 FLIPI, which 
improved prognostication of five-year failure-free survival (Pastore et al., 2015). 
Further, prognosis is negatively impacted by histological transformation. Median survival after 
histological transformation to an aggressive lymphoma is 50 months. Prognosis is worse in patients 
with early (< 18 months) versus late (≥ 18 months) transformation after FL diagnosis (5-year OS: 
22% vs. 76%) (Link et al 2013). A pooled study found histological transformation to be the leading 
cause of death in patients with newly-diagnosed FL (Sarkozy et al 2018).

Management 
The aim of the treatment of FL is primarily the alleviation of symptoms, reversal of cytopenias, and 
improvement of QoL. Treatment largely depends on the tumour burden, stage of the disease, as well 
as patient age (Figure 1, Figure 2). In addition, Grades 1, 2 and 3a are considered indolent disease, 
while FL grade 3b is considered an aggressive lymphoma and is therefore typically recommended to be 
treated as such (Dreyling, 2021). At diagnosis, the majority of patients diagnosed with FL have 
advanced (stage III or IV) disease, with a minority of patients diagnosed with localised stages of FL 
(Stages I-II).  
In the patient group with low tumor burden (Figure 1), patients with stage I/II FL are generally to be 
treated with involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT), which can be combined with single-agent 
rituximab. Watch-and-wait or rituximab monotherapy may also be considered. For patients with low 
tumor burden and stage III/IV FL, watch-and-wait is the standard approach, while rituximab 
monotherapy may also be considered. In case of relapse or progression, watch-and-wait is generally 
recommended, and rituximab monotherapy may also be considered. Depending on stage, involved 
node radiation therapy (INRT) or immuno chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also be considered.

Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 10/154 
 
 
 
 
In the patient group with high tumor burden and stage III/IV disease (Figure 2), treatment 
recommendations depend on the age of the patient, with separate recommendations for patients 
above or below 65 years old. For the majority of patients in both age groups with advanced FL (stage 
III or IV) at diagnosis, watch-and-wait is the standard approach in asymptomatic cases, with 
treatment initiated upon the development of symptoms, including B symptoms, hematopoietic 
impairment, bulky disease, vital organ compression, ascites, pleural effusion, or rapid lymphoma 
progression. First-line therapy in both age groups in these patients generally consists of both induction 
and maintenance phases. In the induction phase, obinutuzumab or rituximab in combination with 
CHOP, CVP or bendamustine is used if complete remission and long PFS are the therapeutic goals, or if 
there is evidence of a more aggressive clinical course. Antibody monotherapy (rituximab, 
radioimmunotherapy) or chlorambucil plus rituximab can be alternatives for patients with a low-risk 
profile or when conventional chemotherapy is contraindicated. After immunochemotherapy, rituximab 
maintenance is recommended every 2 months for 2 years. Alternatively, radioimmunotherapy 
consolidation may be considered after chemotherapy (Dreyling et al., 2021). In stage I-II patients with 
a high tumour burden, adverse clinical prognostic features or in cases where ISRT is not feasible, 
systemic therapy, as indicated for advanced stages, should be applied (Dreyling et al., 2021). 
The treatment of symptomatic relapsed or refractory FL in the patient group with high tumor burden 
and stage III/IV disease (Figure 2) in the EU includes non-cross resistant chemo-immunotherapy 
agents, radio-immunotherapy or rituximab monotherapy, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) 
inhibitor idelalisib and duvelisib, the combination of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and the 
immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, and in selected cases autologous/allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) (Dreyling et al., 2021). The PI3K inhibitor idelalisib was approved by EMA 
in 2014, for the treatment of relapsed FL after at least two lines of systemic therapy based on study 
101-09, which showed a complete response rate (CRR) of 14%, ORR of 56% and DOR of 11.8 months 
(Salles et al., 2017). Duvelisib is another PI3K inhibitor (approved by EMA in March 2021) for the 
treatment of adult patients with refractory FL who have received 2 or more prior systemic therapies. 
The pivotal study showed no 0% CR and 40% PR (Copiktra SmPC). The lenalidomide and rituximab 
combination (so called R2) was approved by EMA in 2019 for the treatment of FL patients after ≥ 1 
line of therapy based on the phase 3 AUGMENT and supportive MAGNIFY trials. In AUGMENT, CRR was 
34% and ORR was 81% (Rummel et al., 2020). High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous HSCT 
can also be a therapeutic option for patients with relapsed FL. Median PFS for patients treated with 
autologous HSCT is around 1 year (Sesques et al., 2020). Allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative 
therapy, and can be considered at relapse after autologous HSCT, but only a small fraction of patients 
with an available donor are candidates for it. Transplant-related mortality remains high at 8-17% at 1 
year (Epperla et al., 2017). A more recent study found a 3-year OS of 66%, with treatment-related 
mortality of 25% at 3 years (Sureda et al., 2018). 
The ESMO guidelines specify which treatments are appropriate for which groups in the 
relapsed/refractory FL population (Dreyling et al., 2021). In the case of relapsed disease, localised 
symptomatic disease may be managed with low-dose ISRT, while in early systemic relapses (<12-24 
months), a non-cross resistant chemoimmunotherapy regimen is to be used. Rituximab should be 
added if the previous antibody-containing scheme achieved >6-12-month duration of remission. 
Rituximab maintenance therapy every 3 months for up to 2 years is recommended for most r/r FL 
patients, except for those who have relapsed during their first rituximab maintenance period. In 
rituximab-refractory cases or remissions lasting <6 months, obinutuzumab-bendamustine (or other 
chemotherapy regimen) plus obinutuzumab maintenance is recommended. High-dose chemotherapy 
with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) should be considered in patients who experience brief first 
remissions after rituximab-containing regimens. In relapsed FL, lenalidomide plus rituximab may be

considered for patients with short remissions after chemotherapy. Radioimmunotherapy may be 
considered in elderly patients with comorbidities.  
In later relapses (Figure 2), immunochemotherapy is recommended in case of a long prior remission, 
or lenalidomide plus rituximab or rituximab monotherapy may be used. In selected cases in both age 
groups, radiotherapy may be used, or idelalisib may be used in double-refractory cases. ASCT may be 
used in selected cases in patients under 65 years old. In selected younger patients with later relapses 
with a high-risk profile or relapse after ASCT, allogeneic HSCT may be considered. 
Figure 2 – ESMO Recommendations for high tumor burden FL (Dreyling, 2021) 
The U.S. treatment guidelines (NCCN, 2021) for third-line and subsequent therapies differ somewhat 
from the European guidelines, and include PI3K inhibitors copanlisib, duvelisib and idelalisib in r/r 
patients after two prior therapies, and umbralisib after three prior therapies, also in elderly or infirm 
patients. In addition, the EZH2 inhibitor tazemotastat is recommended for EZH2 mutation positive r/r 
patients after two prior therapies and in EZH2 wild type or unknown r/r patients with no satisfactory 
treatment options. In addition, the CAR-T cell therapy axicabtagene clioleucel is also a treatment 
option after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
There is an unmet medical need in relapsed and refractory (r/r) FL in that treatment efficacy and 
duration of remission decline with every successive line of therapy, with death occurring due to 
histological transformation to DLBCL or because FL becomes refractory to chemotherapy. Thus, there 
can be considered to be an unmet medical need in FL patients with frequent relapses, where therapies

generally result in modest CRR and responses are not durable, thus necessitating further treatments 
with associated toxicities and risk of histological transformation.
2.1.2.  About the product 
Tisagenlecleucel is a CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy using reprogrammed autologous T cells. The T 
cells contain a transgene encoding a CD19-targeted CAR, containing a murine single chain antibody 
fragment recognizing CD19 fused to intracellular signaling domains from 4-1BB and CD3 zeta. The CD3 
zeta component is critical for initiating T cell activation and antitumor activity, while 4-1BB enhances 
the expansion and importantly, persistence of CAR-positive viable T cells. The CAR-T cells are thus 
able to recognize CD19-expressing cells and mount a response where there is T cell activation, 
expansion, target cell elimination and persistence of the CAR-T cells. As CD19 is widely expressed on 
malignant B cells in B-cell lymphomas, including FL (Freedman 2014), but not on pluripotent stem cells 
or non-B cell tissues, this represents an attractive target. 
Kymriah (INN: tisagenlecleucel; product code CTL019) was approved in the EU via a centralised 
procedure (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090) on 23-Aug-2018 and is currently authorised for the 
treatment of two indications, as follows: 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B-cell acute 
•

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Kymriah is designated as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan condition “Treatment of follicular 
lymphoma” (EU/3/21/2464). A copy of this designation was provided in the application. 
Novartis received the confirmation on 21 May 2021 that the PDCO is of the view that the proposed 
indication for adult patients with r/r FL after two lines of therapies fall under the scope of the Decision 
P/0323/2019, as the indication is considered to be covered by the condition “treatment of mature B-
cell neoplasms” (EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01).  The confirmation letter together with the above-
mentioned Decision were included in the Application to fulfil the requirements of Article 8 of Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006. 
The MAH sought CHMP Scientific advice on r/r FL in SA procedure EMA/SA/0000047236, dated 25-Feb-
2021. The SA addressed questions related to the study design of CCTL019E2202 (hereafter referred to 
as study E2202), including patient population, indication wording, study endpoints, sample size and 
duration of follow-up. Further, the Scientific Advice included questions on the systematic literature 
review and the two real-world evidence (RWE) comparisons included in the application to contextualize 
study E2202. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that study E2202 conducted at sites outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC and the 
ICH E6 Guideline for GCP that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.1.  Quality aspects 
Description of Quality changes 
Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) is an autologous T cell product formulated as single-dose cell dispersion for 
intravenous infusion. Tisagenlecleucel consists of autologous T cells genetically modified ex vivo to 
express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) designed to specifically recognise CD19 
expressing cells and to transduce the signal through the 4-1BB (CD137) and CD3ζ (TCRζ) signalling 
domain upon binding. 
With this variation submission, the MAH is proposing the use of tisagenlecleucel in the adult FL 
indication under Scope C.I.6.a, and amendments are required in Module 3 with respect to the 
leukapheresis material and drug product when manufactured for the FL indication. 
The variation includes information on leukapheresis material characterisation and final product 
characterisation. The results of the manufactured tisagenlecleucel final product batches are included in 
the batch analyses section. The current specifications, as registered for the DLBCL indication, are 
applicable to the FL indication and are justified based on additional final product testing results from FL 
batches. 
The variation also includes editorial changes to include the FL indication. 
2.1.1.  Drug Substance 
Characterisation of leukapheresis starting material for FL is presented. FL batches meet the proposed 
current specification and the commercial specification for the starting material is sufficient to assure 
successful manufacturing. 
2.1.2.  Drug Product 
Specifications 
The current specifications as registered for the DLBCL indication are applicable to the FL indication and 
are justified based on additional final product testing results from FL batches. 
2.1.3.  Conclusions on quality aspects 
The current variation includes information on characterisation of leukapheresis material and final 
product characterisation for the proposed FL indication. There are no proposed changes to the

manufacturing process, which is therefore considered to be the same. Relevant batch data is presented 
No changes are proposed for PBMC of DP specifications for the FL indication, which is considered 
adequately justified. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The “Environmental Risk Assessment – GMO” document has been updated from the initially submitted 
assessment. However, the changes consist of “Minor editorial updates to bring document to 
commercially manageable format”. The conclusions on the environmental risk of the product have not 
been revised. This is considered acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Tisagenlecleucel is a cell-based product and thus no dedicated clinical pharmacology studies were 
conducted. The cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r FL were characterised in 
the pivotal Study E2202. No dedicated clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies were conducted 
The term cellular kinetics is used to describe the in vivo kinetics of tisagenlecleucel post infusion. 
Cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel were determined from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples 
analysed by qPCR that detected the CAR transgene levels (i.e. number of copies of CAR per μg of 
DNA), and flow cytometry methods that detected percentage of CTL019 expressing CD3+ cells. Key 
cellular kinetic parameters indicative of expansion (i.e. “absorption”, maximal level of gene modified 
cells in vivo) and persistence (i.e. “elimination”, duration that CTL019 cells are present in peripheral 
blood and tissues) were Cmax and AUC0-28d, AUC0-84d, half-life (t1/2), Clast and Tlast, respectively. 
Methods 
•  Analytical methods 
For the r/r FL indication the MAH has provided three revised method validations. 
Method DMPK R1580100-ig 
Detection and titration of anti-CTL019 antibodies in human serum samples by flow cytometry. The 
purpose of this study is to cross-validate a method for the detection and titration of anti-mCAR19 
antibodies in human serum to support clinical studies. Anti-mCAR19 antibodies are captured by Jurkat 
T cells transduced to express mouse CAR19 (CTL019 Jurkat cells). To differentiate the anti-drug 
antibodies from those specific to the Jurkat T cells, specimens are also tested separately on WT Jurkat 
T cells. During assay development it was found by the MAH that the majority of human sera from 
untreated individuals show antibody binding either to Jurkat WT cells or CAR19 Jurkat cells or both, to 
highly variable extents. For this reason it was decided to use immunoglobulin depleted sera for the 
validation and System Suitability Control sample(s) SSCs. It is expected that most if not all 
encountered study samples will screen assay positive for one or both cell lines. The observed antibody 
binding is assumed specific, as the humanised anti-CAR19 PC antibody does not bind unspecifically to 
the Jurkat WT cells and also the secondary antibody is removed easily. During method transfer at PRA 
(NPH514EL-155143-A) it was noticed that responses in blank matrices used by Novartis and PRA 
differed. To be able to compare the assay performance at PRA to the assay performance at Novartis a 
cross-validation was performed. 
Method DMPK R1701054-pk  
The purpose of this study was to validate an assay for the quantitation of Rituxan in human serum. 
This electrochemiluminescence assay used an anti-Rituximab antibody to capture the Rituxan drug and 
an anti-Rituximab detection antibody conjugated to biotin in conjunction with ruthenium-labelled 
Streptavidin (SA-SulfoTag) to detect the drug. 
Validation of the method included calibration curve response and range, LLOQ and ULOQ, intra- and 
inter-assay precision and accuracy, selectivity, matrix interference, dilutional linearity, MRD, prozone 
effect, and target interference. Working calibration standards were prepared at nominal concentrations 
of 25600, 12800, 10000, 6400, 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, and 50 ng/mL in neat pooled human

serum. Also, validation samples (VS) were prepared prior to validation by spiking Rituxan into pooled 
human serum at 12800 (ULOQ), 10000 (High), 1600 (Mid), 200 (Low), and 100 (LLOQ) ng/mL. The 
assay range was defined by the LLOQ and ULOQ, the lowest and highest VS, respectively, and the 
standard calibrators that meet acceptance criteria for intra- and interassay precision and accuracy. 
Method GDX-RPT1324 
Quantitative detection of Murine CART19 transgene DNA in human blood, human transfected T cells 
and human bone marrow by qPCR. The original validation was performed using human blood and bone 
marrow samples collected from healthy donors and spiked with varying amounts of Jurkat cells 
expressing the murine CART19 construct. These specimens were created in bulk and 200 μL volumes 
were aliquoted into micro-centrifuge tubes and frozen at -80°C. Samples were thawed and DNA 
extracted using the Promega Maxwell CSC in the original validation. The Promega Maxwell CSC DNA 
isolation method was replaced with the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit in the addendum validation to 
accommodate processing of larger sample volumes. DNA was also extracted from 200 μL of 
transfected T cell specimens using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. The concentrations of the stock 
DNA extracted from these samples were determined spectrophotometrically by taking optical density 
readings using the NanoDrop kit. OD readings were recorded at 260nm and 280nm to determine both 
concentration and purity. DNA was either used immediately post extraction or frozen at -20°C until 
required for use. The addendum validation was performed using remnant patient blood samples and 
human blood and bone marrow samples collected from healthy donors and spiked with varying 
amounts of murine CART19 plasmid DNA. The spiked specimens were created in bulk volume and 
aliquoted into micro-centrifuge tubes in volumes of 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 mL and frozen at -80°C. Samples 
were thawed and DNA extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit. The concentrations of the stock 
DNA extracted from these samples were determined by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit kit. If 
the DNA concentration for a specimen was determined to be lower than the minimum required for the 
assay, the specimen DNA was concentrated using the Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit and the 
concentration measured again. The DNA was either used immediately post extraction or frozen at -
20°C until required for use. Parameters validated was linearity and dynamic range, limit of detection, 
lower limit of quantification, accuracy, robustness and precision. 
•  Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r FL were characterised in the pivotal 
Study E2202 (see Table 3 for details). As both qPCR and flow cytometry were used to measure levels 
of transgene and percentage CD3+CAR+ cells, respectively, for the derivation of cellular kinetic 
parameters in Study E2202, a correlation analysis between these two assays was performed to 
evaluate the relationship between the presence of CAR transgene and the functional CAR. The r2 for 
time-matched peripheral blood concentrations from qPCR and flow cytometry was 0.290 indicating a 
moderate degree of correlation between the data from these two different analytical methods (flow 
cytometry and qPCR). Unless stated otherwise, all cellular kinetic parameters presented henceforth in 
this section are based on qPCR methodology as it is a robust and sensitive method.

Table 3. Overview of study E2202 including sampling and analytical methods used 
According to the MAH, blood and bone marrow samples were collected from all patients for the 
assessment of tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics. Additionally, serum samples were collected and 
assessed for rituximab and tocilizumab. 
The entities measured are summarised below: 
•  CAR19 transgene levels as generated by qPCR 
•  CAR-positive viable T-cells measured by flow cytometry of 
o  CD3+ cells 
o  CD3+/CD4+ cells 
o  CD3+/CD8+ cells 
Cellular kinetic parameters assessed in this study are listed in Table 4. Cmax reflects the level of 
maximal expansion of transgene in peripheral blood following the infusion while AUC0-28d and AUC0-84d 
indicate the exposure within the first 28 and 84 days, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of 
tocilizumab have been reported as it is used for the management of CRS. 
Tisagenlecleucel concentrations in peripheral blood and bone marrow were listed, graphed and 
descriptively summarised by time points as assessed by the following: 
• 
Tisagenlecleucel transgene levels as measured by qPCR 
•  CAR-positive T-cells measured by flow cytometry of CD3+ /CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ CAR-
positive viable T-cells. 
Frequency of sampling was intense in blood and sparce in bone marrow. Planned study sampling is 
listed in section 7.2.3.1. in the study Protocol (Clinical Study Report Appendix 16.1.1, v1.0). The 
cellular kinetic parameters listed in Table 4 were estimated from the individual concentration versus 
time profiles using a non-compartmental approach within the modeling program Phoenix® (Pharsight, 
Mountain View, CA). 
Descriptive statistics of cellular kinetic parameters were summarised and reported by BOR and Month 3 
disease response. 
AUC and Cmax were found to be strongly correlated, indicating that each could serve as a surrogate for 
the other (r2 values of 0.950 and 0.868, respectively, for AUC0-28d and AUC0-84d). AUC0-28d being a more 
robust indicator of cellular expansion and exposure for up to 28 days, this parameter has been used 
extensively in this document to discuss the relationships.

For patients whose tocilizumab PK data was collected during CRS, the tocilizumab concentrations were 
summarised by time points, relative to time of tocilizumab dose. Tocilizumab concentrations and PK 
parameters were summarised by CRS grade for the TPAS. Rituximab concentrations were also 
summarised by Month 3 and BOR for the EAS. 
Table 4. Non-compartmental cellular kinetic parameters.  
Data from Study E2202 were used to assess relationships between product attributes and in-process 
parameters, and cellular kinetic, infused dose, and best overall responses. The impact of intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors on cellular kinetics were assessed using cellular kinetic parameters determined from 
non-compartment analyses. 
No population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models have been submitted in support of the current 
application. 
•  Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
Dose-exposure, dose-response, and exposure-response modelling has been performed for both 
efficacy and safety endpoints. No modelling report describing model development have been 
submitted, consequently the methods has not been assessed in detail. Since the models are submitted 
for descriptive purposes and not for dose justification or evaluation of dosing strategies, this issue will 
not be further pursued in the current application. 
Results 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
•  Dose proportionality 
The relationship between log-transformed cellular kinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-84d and AUC0-28d, and 
total tisagenlecleucel cell dose are explored using scatter plot and linear regression. Results of the 
analysis indicated no strong relationship between the dose and the cellular kinetic parameters with r2 
values below or close to 0.1 for all cellular kinetic parameters analysed across the entire studied dose 
range of 0.1 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T cells (Figure 3). Boxplots and summary of cellular kinetic 
parameters by dose quartiles demonstrated that estimated parameters were comparable and within 
overlapping ranges across all dose quartiles.

Demographics 
The cellular kinetic analysis set (CKAS) (n=94) in study E2202 consisted of patients in the efficacy 
analysis set (EAS) who provided an evaluable cellular kinetic profile (at least 1 cellular kinetic 
parameter). The CKAS includes all patients that received tisagenlecleucel manufactured at the US 
manufacturing facility (n=58), Stein, Switzerland (n=11), Les Ulis (formerly Cell for Cure), France 
(n=20), and Kobe, Japan manufacturing facility (FBRI) (n=8). The CKAS was used for summaries 
(tables and figures) of cellular kinetic data. The tisagenlecleucel infused set (all the patients who 
received tisagenlecleucel) was used for listings of cellular kinetic data. The tocilizumab

Cellular kinetics in blood 
The recommended tisagenlecleucel dose range in this study was 0.6 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-
cells. All patients, except for 4, who received a lower dose than specified as per protocol (OOS range: 
0.1 to 0.46×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells), received tisagenlecleucel within the targeted dose range. 
Additionally, one patient received tisagenlecleucel product that was OOS due to lower viability at 
51.7% (specified: ≥ 70%) but with an overall dose of CAR-positive viable T-cells in the targeted dose 
range (dose received: 0.8×108 cells), and one patient received tisagenlecleucel product that was OOS 
due to a higher dose. However, the site was instructed by Novartis to infuse 91% of the volume and 
the patient was administered a dose of 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells that was within 
specification. The median dose administered was 2.06×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells (range: 0.1 to 
6.0×108 cells). The median total viable cell count was 12×108 cells (range: 0.4 to 34.0 ×108 cells). 
The median time from enrolment to infusion was 46 days (range: 23 to 127 days). The median 
duration of follow-up from infusion to the data cut-off date was 16.59 months (range: 10.3 to 25.7 
months) for the Enrolled set and 16.85 months (range: 10.3 to 25.7 months) for the EAS. 
Results: The time course of CAR transgene levels following infusion is presented by BOR in Figure 4. 
Following infusion, tisagenlecleucel typically exhibits an initial rapid expansion phase achieving 
maximal expansion (Cmax) followed by a bi-exponential decline. The area under the curve (AUC0-28d or 
AUC0-84d) of the cellular kinetic profile indicates the transgene exposure (up to 28 or 84 days from 
infusion), whereas the Cmax indicates the level of maximal expansion of the tisagenlecleucel transgene. 
A representative cellular kinetic profile of an individual FL patient, with a complete response based on 
BOR, from Study E2202 is presented in Figure 5.

Summary of peripheral blood cellular kinetic parameters for tisagenlecleucel transgene levels by qPCR 
are shown in Table 5. Shortly for patients in the CKAS, the geometric mean AUC0-84d in responders (CR 
and PR) was similar to that in non-responders (SD and PD) based on clinical best overall response 
(BOR). However, the geometric mean AUC0-28d value of responders was 186% higher compared to non-
responders, while the geometric mean Cmax value was 109% higher in responders compared to non-
responders. Figure 4 shows similar pattern of mean cellular kinetic profiles between responder and 
non-responder patients. The time to maximal expansion (Tmax) was comparable between the two 
groups (median Tmax: 10 days and 13 days in responder and non-responder patients, respectively). For 
10 of the responder patients, the Cmax values were not available or could not be reliably estimated due 
to inappropriate sample processing at the clinical site or because the patients missed 3 or more time 
points of PK assessment, which were documented as protocol deviations. 
CAR-positive viable T cells demonstrated persistence of the tisagenlecleucel transgene for up to a 
maximum of 558 days in responders and a maximum of 366 days in non-responders, as demonstrated 
by maximum Tlast value (time of last quantifiable concentrations) (Table 5, Figure 5).

Cellular kinetics in bone marrow 
Limited data on transgene levels (measured by qPCR) in bone marrow were available as the aspirate 
were collected only in patients with bone marrow involvement. By BOR, the geometric mean transgene 
level in responders (n=12) at Month 3 was 214 copies/μg DNA and range was 59.9 to 2620 copies/μg 
DNA. Further the geometric mean transgene levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow were similar 
at Month 3, demonstrating trafficking of CAR T cells from blood to bone marrow. Similar results were 
observed by Month 3 disease response.  
Summary of partitioning of blood, bone marrow and lymph node concentrations at month 3, including 
the blood to bone marrow partitioning in bone marrow is shown in Table 7.

Cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel by CRS 
The cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel were evaluated by CRS grade to determine whether there are 
differences in expansion by CRS category. To note, no cases of CRS ≥ grade 3 were observed within 8 
weeks of tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022

Cmax was greater in patients with grade 1 or 2 CRS relative to patients with no CRS. The geometric 
mean Cmax (geometric-CV%) was 10100 (381%) copies/μg in patients with grade 1 or 2 CRS (n=40) 
and 2990 (282%) copies/μg in patients with no CRS (n=35). Similar results were observed with AUC0-
28d estimates. The Tmax was approximately 9 days in patients with grade 1 or 2 CRS (n=40), and 13 
days in patients with no CRS (n=35). Consistent with these results, higher expansion was observed in 
patients that received tocilizumab (n=17, tisagenlecleucel infused set), as the administration of 
tocilizumab is associated with the management of CRS, as per the CRS management algorithm. 
The in vivo persistence of tisagenlecleucel (i.e., median Tlast) was similar across all CRS categories, 
suggesting no apparent impact of CRS on in vivo persistence. The median apparent half-life (T1/2) was 
approximately 37 days in patients with grade 1 or 2 CRS (n=31), and 86 days in patients with no CRS 
(n=18). 
Relationship between product attributes and cellular kinetics, dose or response 
The MAH presents data from a number of analyses that were designed to evaluate the relations 
between in-process parameters, final product attributes and cellular kinetics, dose and in vivo 
performance parameters (Table 8). 
Table 8. Evaluation of product attributes vs cellular kinetics, infused dose, and BOR 
The results for FL were similar to that in r/r DLBCL. 
Infused doses were either not correlated or only weakly correlated with both product attributes and in-
process parameters. Thus, dose selection for individual patients would not be affected by the rate of in 
vitro expansion of the product or the final release specifications. From an efficacy perspective, clinical 
responders were observed across the entire range of specifications for release of the final product. 
There was no apparent relationship between product attributes, namely, percentage T cells, total cell 
count, transduction efficiency by flow cytometry, cell viability (%), transduction efficiency by qPCR, 
and IFN-gamma release level and BOR to treatment with tisagenlecleucel when administered within 
the attribute ranges required for use (Table 9).

A comparison of cellular kinetic parameters by manufacturing site was also performed. The geometric 
mean (geometric-CV%) of Cmax were 4850 (449.4), 3950 (233.9), 5170 (226.8), and 14400 (496.5) 
for patients with batches manufactured at Morris Plains (n=45), FBRI (n=8), Les Ulis (n=15), and 
Stein (n=11), respectively. Boxplots of expansion by manufacturing site showed similar mean 
expansion for the product manufactured at the Morris plains, Les Ulis, and FBRI sites, with seemingly 
higher expansion at for product manufactured at Stein facility (Figure 6).

Special populations 
The impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel are summarised by 
descriptive statistics, box plots, and scatter plots. 
The intrinsic parameters evaluated were age, gender, body weight, race, Follicular Lymphoma 
International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) at enrolment, histological grade, baseline lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), disease stage, POD 24 (patients primary refractory or experiencing progression of disease 
within 24 months from initiation of a first-line anti-CD20 mAb containing treatment), and refractoriness 
to last therapy, using summary statistics as well as graphically.

Extrinsic factors such as the effect of concomitant medication and prior therapy were evaluated 
similarly (assessed in the section Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or 
substances). 
• 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No dedicated renal or hepatic impairment studies have been conducted. 
•  Gender 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters by gender showed 106% and 111% higher geometric mean 
AUC0-28d and Cmax values, respectively, for female patients compared with male patients. The geometric 
mean AUC0-28d in copies/μg×days (geometric-CV%) was 78400 (247.4%) and 38000 (487.4%) for 
female and male, respectively and the geometric mean Cmax in copies/μg (geometric-CV%) was 9070 
(269.5%) and 4290 (436.8%) for female and male, respectively. However, considering the high 
variability and overlapping ranges, gender does not appear to influence tisagenlecleucel expansion. 
Figure 7. Boxplot of qPCR cellular kinetic parameters for tisagenlecleucel by gender 
(Tisagenlecleucel infused set).  
•  Race 
Boxplots and summary statistics showed overlapping ranges of cellular kinetic parameters, suggesting 
that race does not appear to impact tisagenlecleucel exposure metrics (Cmax, AUC0-28d, AUC0-84d, and 
Tmax). Race which is self-reported included White (N=73, 75.3%), Asian (N=13, 13.4%) or missing 
(N=10, 10.3%) (N=1 African American patient did not have valid PK parameters and thus was not 
included in the analysis). After adjusting for covariates of age, baseline weight and gender, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 30/154 
 
 
 
 
 
geometric mean ratios (Asian vs. white) are 0.86 (95% CI: 0.32 to 2.31) and 0.53 (95% CI: 0.206 to 
1.36) for AUC0-28d and Cmax, respectively; however, considering the limited number of evaluable 
patients in Asian group and the large variability, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
•  Age 
The impact of age on cellular kinetics was evaluated across the age range of 29 to 73 years. The 
scatter plots of cellular kinetic parameters versus age revealed no apparent relationship between age 
and expansion parameters; AUCs (AUC0-28d and AUC0-84d), Cmax, and Tmax (r2 value ranged from 0.012 
to 0.064) (Figure 8). 
Boxplots (Figure 9) and summary statistics of cellular kinetic parameters by age categories (<65 years 
(N=73) or ≥65 years (N=24)) shows that estimated parameters (AUC0-28d and Cmax) are within 
comparable ranges with lower geometric means in patients ≥65 years, and the differences are not 
considered relevant due to high inter-individual variabilities associated with the parameters.

Infused set).  
•  Weight 
Baseline body weight does not have an effect on the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel. Across the 
weight ranges (44.3-127.7 kg), the scatter plots of cellular kinetic parameters versus weight revealed 
no relevant relationship between the kinetic parameters and baseline weight. The r2 values were close 
to zero, ranging from 0.009 to 0.047. The analysis of baseline weight by quartiles of AUC0-28d and Cmax 
suggested a consistent result. Weight did not influence the expansion of tisagenlecleucel. 
•  Other factors influencing cellular kinetics 
Disease stage 
Categories of disease stage at study entry did not impact tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics (Table 11). 
However, due to the small number of patients with evaluable cellular kinetic parameters in Stage I/II 
category (n=13) relative to the number of patients in Stage III/IV category (n=64), and the large 
variability associated with cellular kinetic parameters, results should be interpreted with caution.

Table 11. Summary of peripheral blood cellular kinetic parameters for tisagenlecleucel by 
disease stage at study entry (Tisagenlecleucel infused set).  
Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) at enrolment  
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters by FLIPI at enrolment (low/intermediate (n=39) vs. high 
(n=58)) demonstrated 47% and 62% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric mean values, respectively, in 
patients with high FLIPI (AUC0-28d: n=46, Cmax: n=47) relative to low or intermediate FLIPI (AUC0-28d: 
n=31, Cmax: n=32).  
Histological grade 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters by histological grade at study entry (grade 1-2, low grade 
(n=87) vs. grade 3A (n=10)) demonstrated 105% and 113% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric mean 
values, respectively, in patients with grade 1-2 FL (AUC0-28d: n=68, Cmax: n=70) relative to grade 3A FL 
(AUC0-28d/Cmax n=9). However, these data should be interpreted with caution due the small number of 
patients in the grade 3A group and the large associated variability. The geometric mean AUC0-28d in 
copies/μg×days (geometric-CV%): 54300 (426.5%) and 26500 (204.8%) for grade 1-2 and grade 3A, 
respectively, and geometric mean Cmax in copies/μg: 6100 (400.5%) and 2860 (269.7%) for grade 1-2 
and grade 3A, respectively. 
Baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters by baseline LDH (≤upper limit of normal (ULN) (n=65) vs. 
>ULN (n=31)) demonstrated comparable AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric-mean values between the two 
categories, considering the high variability associated with these parameters. The geometric mean 
AUC0-28d in copies/µg×days (geometric-CV%) 49800 (469.0%) and 53700 (294.8%) for ≤ULN (n=53) 
and >ULN (n=23), respectively, and geometric mean Cmax in copies/µg (geometric-CV%) were 5540 
(405.7%) and 6190 (372.2%) for ≤ULN (n=55) and >ULN (n=23), respectively.

POD 24 (patients primary refractory or experiencing progression of disease within 24 months from 
initiation of a first-line anti-CD20 mAb containing treatment) 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters for patients who did not report progression of disease (POD) 
within 24 months from anti-CD20 containing first-line therapy (POD24) (n=36) vs. patients who 
reported POD24 (n=61) demonstrated 98% and 199% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric mean 
values, respectively, in patients who did not report POD24 relative to patients reporting POD24. The 
geometric mean AUC0-28d in copies/μg×days (geometric-CV%) were 37000 (211.1%) and 73100 
(769.0%) for patients with POD24 (n=43) and patients without POD24 (n=34), respectively and Cmax 
in copies/μg (geometric-CV%) were 3550 (317.4%) and 10600 (370.5%) for patients with POD24 
(n=46) and patients without POD24 (n=33), respectively. These results indicate that patients who did 
not progress within 24 months following the first line anti-CD20 therapy demonstrated higher 
expansion compared to patients who experienced POD24.  
Refractoriness to last therapy 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters for patients by refractoriness to last therapy (patients 
relapsed (n=18) vs. those who had refractory disease (n=75)) demonstrated 115% higher AUC0-28d 
and Cmax geometric mean values in patients who relapsed relative to patients who had refractory 
disease. The geometric mean AUC0-28d in copies/μg x day (geometric-CV%) for patients who relapsed 
(n=17) was 94400 (428.5%) and 43900 (389.4%) for patients who had refractory disease (n=57). 
The geometric mean Cmax in copies/μg (geometric-CV%) for patients who relapsed (n=17) was 10700 
(494.5%) and 4980 (356.4%) for patients who had refractory disease (n=59).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed with tisagenlecleucel as there is no 
mechanistic basis for a pharmacokinetic drug interaction. T-cells are known to be susceptible to 
immuno-suppressive agents. Immuno-suppressive agents should be used with caution when 
administered following infusion of tisagenlecleucel since such agents may be lymphotoxic. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No additional clinical pharmacodynamics data have been submitted for this application. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
There are potential pharmacodynamic interactions that may occur between tisagenlecleucel, and 
agents administered as part of bridging and/or lymphodepletion conditioning regimens prior to 
tisagenlecleucel treatment. 
Rituximab 
Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is known to cause long term B cell aplasia (Dotan 
et al 2010). Tisagenlecleucel has previously been shown to cause long term B cell aplasia in other 
indications and is an expected effect. In this study, all the patients had received rituximab as a prior 
antineoplastic therapy. With a long terminal half-life (median T1/2=22 days) of rituximab (anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody) reported in NHL patients (Rituxan® USPI), it was not unexpected that high 
levels of rituximab were still measurable at Day 28 and Month 3 following tisagenlecleucel infusion. B 
cell counts in peripheral blood were summarised at baseline and by time point. 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 34/154 
 
 
 
At baseline, in all the patients, the mean cell counts for B-cells cells were low, which could be 
attributed to the heavy pre-treatment. Post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, the mean cell counts of B-cells 
increased over time in some of the patients with corresponding decline in the transgene levels. The 
majority of these patients, however, remained in remission despite the recovery B cell and the decline 
in the transgene level, consistent with the observation noted in DLBCL patients. 
In Study E2202, by BOR, the geometric mean concentrations of rituximab (geometric-CV%) (ng/mL) 
at pre-dose, for responders (n=36) and non-responders (n=6) were 3360 (787.0%) ng/mL and 9810 
(165.9%) ng/mL, respectively. At Day 28 post-infusion the geometric mean concentration (geometric-
CV%) for responders (n=29) was 2230 (679.4%) ng/mL and for non-responders (n=6) it was 5230 
(224.4%) ng/mL. The rituximab levels were overlapping in responders and non-responders with high 
inter-individual variability, at pre-infusion and at post-infusion visits, and therefore does not seem to 
have a relationship with response. 
Similar results were observed by Month 3 disease response. 
Prior bendamustine use 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters for patients by prior bendamustine use (patients who 
received prior bendamustine (n=66) vs. those who did not (n=31)) demonstrated 83% and 15% 
higher AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric mean values, respectively, in patients who did not receive prior 
bendamustine relative to patients who did receive prior bendamustine. The geometric mean AUC0-28d in 
copies/μg×days (geometric-CV%) for patients with prior bendamustine use was 41700 (365.7%) 
(n=54) vs. 76400 (458.9%) for patients who had no prior use (n=23). The geometric mean Cmax in 
copies/μg (geometric-CV%) was comparable between the patients with prior use, 5360 (327.7%) 
(n=54) relative to patients with no use, 6150 (594.6%) (n=25). These results indicate that 
bendamustine has no effect on tisagenlecleucel expansion in the studied population. 
Number of prior lines of anti-neoplastic therapy 
Overall, the number of lines of prior therapy did not impact tisagenlecleucel exposure described by 
AUC0-28d, and Cmax. The exposure parameters were comparable across patients with different number 
of prior therapy lines, considering the overlapping ranges and variability associated with the 
parameters. The geometric mean Cmax (geometric-CV%, n) was similar between patients with ≤2 lines 
of prior therapy (4040 copies/µg, 398.0%; n=22) and in patients with >4 lines of prior therapy (4730 
copies/μg, 415.4%; n=22); however, the mean Cmax was observed to be higher in patients with 3-4 
lines of prior therapy (7640 copies/μg, 364.8%; n=35).  
Prior hematopoietic stem cell treatment (HSCT) status 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters for patients by prior HSCT (patients who received HSCT 
(n=35) vs. those who did not (n=62)) demonstrated 69% and 61% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric 
mean values, respectively, in patients who received prior HSCT (AUC0-28d: n=28, Cmax: n=27) relative 
to patients who did not receive prior HSCT (AUC0-28d: n=49, Cmax: n=52). This difference is considered 
not to have a clinically relevant impact. 
Bridging therapy 
Of the 97 patients infused, 44 patients (45.4%) received optional antineoplastic bridging therapy prior 
to tisagenlecleucel infusion. All infused patients received LD chemotherapy prior to tisagenlecleucel 
infusion. In 5 patients, only corticosteroids were administered as bridging therapy. Furthermore, 2 
patients received bridging radiotherapy – 1 patient received only radiotherapy and the other patient 
received radiotherapy and corticosteroids. 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 35/154 
 
 
 
Comparison of cellular kinetic parameters by bridging therapy demonstrated 96% and 27% higher 
AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric mean values, respectively, in patients who received bridging therapy 
relative to patients who did not received bridging therapy. The geometric mean AUC0-28d in 
copies/μg×days (geometric-CV%) for patients who received bridging therapy (n=31) was 74600 
(245.8%), compared to 38100 (510.2%) for patients who did not receive bridging therapy (n=46). 
The geometric mean Cmax in copies/μg (geometric-CV%) for patients who received bridging therapy 
(n=35) was 6380 (390.8%), compared to 5040 (396.8%) for patients who did not receive bridging 
therapy (n=44) (Appendix 1-Figure 2.2.8.1 and Appendix 1-Table 2.2.8.1). 
Lymphodepletion 
All infused patients received LD chemotherapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. The majority of 
patients (n=92) received fludarabine + cyclophosphamide, and the remaining 5 patients received 
bendamustine. 
Patients who received prior bendamustine had approximately 19% and 42% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax 
geometric mean values compared to patients who received fludarabine + cyclophosphamide. However, 
due to small number of patients that received bendamustine as the LD chemotherapy and high 
variability associated with the parameters, no strong conclusion can be drawn. The geometric mean 
AUC0-28d in copies/μg×days (geometric-CV%): 59000 (118.2%) and 49400 (432.3%) for patients who 
received prior bendamustine and patients who received fludarabine + cyclophosphamide, respectively 
and Cmax in copies/μg: 7780 (143.2%) and 5470 (415.5%) for patients who received prior 
bendamustine and patients who received fludarabine + cyclophosphamide, respectively.). 
CRS management with tocilizumab and corticosteroids 
In study E2202, 48 patients (49.5%) experienced CRS event. A total of 17 patients (17.5%) in the 
Tisagenlecleucel infused set received anti-cytokine medication for CRS. All 17 patients received 
tocilizumab and 4 of them received corticosteroids in addition (Table 12).  
Table 12 Anti-cytokine medications administered during CRS by maximum CRS grade 
Tisagenlecleucel infused set.  
Impact of tocilizumab on cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel 
In Study E2202, tocilizumab was administrated to patients for the management of CRS, and the 
impact of the anti-cytokine medication on the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel was investigated. In 
the study, 48 patients (49.5%) had experienced CRS event. Sixteen patients in the safety population, 
required tocilizumab: 8 patients received one dose, 5 patients received two doses and 3 patients 
received 3 doses. In all the patients, the dose of tocilizumab administered was 8 mg/kg, with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 36/154 
 
 
 
 
exception of one patient who received a slightly higher dose of 8.84 mg/kg. Tocilizumab concentrations 
were collected at different time points post-infusion in patients who received tocilizumab for the 
management of CRS.  
The extent of maximal expansion (Cmax) estimates was nearly 312% higher in patients who received 
tocilizumab for CRS management (n=11, geometric mean Cmax (geometric-CV%): 18300 (628.5%) 
copies/μg) relative to patients who did not receive tocilizumab (n=62, geometric mean Cmax 
(geometric-CV%): 4440 (344.2%) copies/μg). Similarly, the geometric mean AUC0-28d was nearly 
245% higher for patients that received tocilizumab (n=12, geometric mean AUC0-28d estimate: 
137000 (604.9%) copies/μg×days), compared to patients that did not receive tocilizumab (n=59, 
geometric mean AUC0-28d estimate: 39700 (371.3%) copies/μg×days). However, the time of maximal 
expansion (Tmax) for tisagenlecleucel transgene was approximately 10 days, irrespective of use of 
tocilizumab. Boxplot of AUC0-28d and Cmax by use of tocilizumab (Tisagenlecleucel infused set) are 
shown in Figure 10. 
The MAH states that the true influence of tocilizumab on expansion cannot be ascertained directly since 
this observation may have been confounded as tocilizumab is given for management of CRS and 
positive correlation was observed for exposure-CRS relationship. Model based analysis had 
demonstrated that transgene continued to expand and persist following tocilizumab administration 
(Stein et al 2019).

Summary of cellular kinetic parameters by use of corticosteroids 
All patients received corticosteroids post tisagenlecleucel infusion, however only 3 patients received 
corticosteroids for the management of CRS. Systemic anti-cytokine treatment with tocilizumab or 
corticosteroids was required for the management of CRS in 16 patients (34.0%), 13 of whom required 
only 1 (n=8) or 2 (n=5) doses of tocilizumab, and 3 patients required both tocilizumab and 
corticosteroids (i.e. dexamethasone (n=1) and methylprednisolone sodium succinate (n=2)). As per 
the protocol CRS management algorithm, tocilizumab 8 mg/kg could be administered every 8 hours 
starting from grade 2 CRS (for a maximum of 3 doses within 24 h). 
Three patients received corticosteroids for the management of CRS. Higher AUC0-28d observed in 
patients who received corticosteroid for the management of CRS relative to patients that received it for 
other reasons. However, the effect might be confounded by the administration of tocilizumab, CRS 
event, or tumor burden and should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients 
receiving corticosteroids for CRS management. 
Relationship between dose, cellular kinetics and effect 
The dose-response, dose-safety, and dose-cellular kinetics analyses were performed using the data 
obtained from r/r FL patients (data cut-off date: 29-March-2021) in Phase 2 study (Study E2202) to 
assess the impact of dose on exposure, response, and selected safety endpoints in order to select safe 
and efficacious doses for use in the prescribing setting (commercial). 
Dose–response relationships 
The relationship between tisagenlecleucel dose and response (efficacy and safety) was explored. Dose-
efficacy and dose-safety analyses were based on efficacy and safety analysis sets, respectively. The 
relationship between log-transformed cellular kinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-84d and AUC0-28d, and total 
tisagenlecleucel cell dose are discussed above in the section Dose proportionality and time 
dependency. 
Doses administered to r/r FL patients in Study E2202 ranged from 0.1 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable 
T cells, where four patients received a dose lower than the specified clinical trial dose. The lowest dose 
at which CR was observed was 0.46×108 CAR-positive viable cells, similar to the currently approved 
lower end of dose range in DLBCL patients (i.e., 0.6×108 CAR-positive viable cells), although patient 
progressed on Day 560 with a duration of remission of 476 days. Four patients received a dose of 0.8 
×108 CAR-positive viable cells, all with a best overall response of complete response and of which 
three patients are ongoing responders without an event (with longest duration of remission of 451 
days. 
Dose-efficacy relationship 
Efficacy endpoints evaluated for dose-response analysis included BOR, DOR, PFS and time to new anti-
lymphoma therapy. The specific analyses are detailed in Table 13, and were performed using the EAS 
(N=94).

Table 13. Dose-efficacy analysis 
Dose-BOR analysis 
The relation between CAR-positive viable cell dose and the probability of achieving BOR of CR only or 
CR/PR was analysed by logistic regression across the entire studied dose range (0.1 to 6.0×108) 
(Figure 10). Additionally, BOR was summarized by CAR-positive viable cell dose quartiles. 
Favourable clinical responses (CR/PR) were observed across the entire recommended dose range. 
Based on a logistic regression analysis, the odds of achieving a BOR of CR/PR upon doubling the dose 
were estimated to be increased by 67% (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 0.95 to 2.95). 
Dose-response curve for the probability of CR/PR is showing an increasing trend of probability with 
increase in dose towards the lower end of the dose range (<1.0×108 cells). The dose-response curve 
reached a plateau at doses greater than 1.0×108 CAR-positive viable cells. It should be noted that 4 
patients were infused with doses <0.6×108 and the lowest dose at which CR was observed was 
0.46×108 CAR-positive viable cells. Moreover, similar response rates were observed across CAR-
positive viable cell dose-quartiles.

observed proportions (Efficacy analysis set).  
Dose-Duration of response analysis 
In Study E2202, the median dose for Efficacy analysis set was 2.06×108 CAR-positive viable T cells. 
The Kaplan-Meier analysis of duration of response (DOR, time from achievement of CR or PR to an 
event of PD or death due to FL) for patients indicated a similar DOR in patients treated with doses 
greater (N=39) than and equal/less (N=42) than the median cell dose. Based on the Cox regression 
model of DOR by log of dose, doubling the dose is associated with hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI: 
0.390, 1.108) indicating no statistically significant difference in DOR depending on dose. Similarly, 
analysis by quartile of dose infused shows no difference in DOR among the quartiles of dose. 
Dose-Progression free survival analysis 
The relationship between dose and PFS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Similar PFS was 
observed in patients treated with doses greater than and equal or less than median viable cell dose 
with median PFS not yet estimable in either dose category. Based on the Cox regression model of PFS 
by log of dose, doubling the dose is associated with hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.494, 1.138) 
indicating no clinically relevant difference in PFS depending on dose. 
Dose-Time to start of new anti-lymphoma therapy analysis 
The relationship between dose and time to start of new anti-lymphoma therapy was evaluated using 
Kaplan-Meier analyses. Similar results were observed in patients treated with doses greater than and 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022

equal or less than median viable cell dose with median time to new therapy not yet reached in both 
dose categories. Based on the Cox regression model, doubling the dose is associated with hazard ratio 
of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.287, 0.695). Despite the observed relationship between the dose and start of new 
anti-lymphoma therapy, the effect may not be clinically relevant due to limited sample size (only 20 
patients required new anti-lymphoma therapy). In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar 
time to start of new anti-lymphoma therapy by median dose.

transduced viable cell dose (Efficacy analysis set).  
Dose-safety analyses 
To evaluate the impact of dose on safety endpoint, occurrence of cytokine release symptom, impact on 
serious neurological events and time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenias were explored using the 
safety analysis set (N=97). Only events within 8 weeks of infusion were included in all analyses of CRS 
and serious neurological events. Details of the dose-safety analysis are shown in Table 15.

Across the entire studied dose range, no high-grade CRS (grade 3 or higher) was observed within 8 
weeks of infusion, as 47/97 (48.5%) patients experienced CRS of maximum grade 1 or 2. Moreover, 
CRS was manageable with the steps outlined in the CRS management algorithm. Logistic regression 
results shows relatively flat relationship between probability of any grade CRS and dose at higher 
doses (>1×108) indicating that there is no apparent increased risk of CRS with higher CAR-positive 
viable T cell doses. Based on the model estimates, the odds ratio for any grade CRS with doubling of

the infused cell dose was estimated to be 1.41 (95% CI: 0.855 to 2.326). Lower incidence of grade 1 
or grade 2 CRS was observed (32%) at the lowest dose quartile (≤1.4×108) compared to ~54% at all 
other dose quartiles.

observed proportions (Safety analysis set).  
Dose-serious neurological events analysis 
Across the entire studied dose range, only 9 patients (9.3%) out of 97 experienced serious neurologic 
events post tisagenlecleucel infusion within the initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, including 
6 events in the lower dose category (≤2.1×108) and 3 events in the higher dose category (>2.1×108). 
Logistic regression shows a flat relationship between the probability of serious neurologic events and 
CAR-positive viable T cell dose which indicates that there is no apparent impact of CAR-positive viable 
cell dose on the probability of serious neurological events. Based on model estimates, with two-fold 
increase in dose, the odds ratio for any grade serious neurological event is 0.74 (95% CI: 0.383 to 
1.419). 
Dose-hematopoietic cytopenias analysis 
A Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier plot were used to explore the relationship between dose and 
time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenias (based on laboratory data), including neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia. The results showed no apparent impact of dose on the time to the resolution of 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; however, the data are limited and insufficient to support a 
definitive conclusion. 
Exposure-response relationships 
The relationship between tisagenlecleucel exposure and response (efficacy and safety) was explored. 
Exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses were based on efficacy and safety analysis sets, 
respectively.  
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
Exposure-BOR relationship 
Desirable clinical outcomes (CR and PR) were achieved across the entire range of the observed in vivo 
exposure following tisagenlecleucel infusion. BOR by independent review committee (IRC) assessment 
is summarized by quartile of qPCR exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC0-28d) in Appendix 1-Table 4.1-
5. The overall response rates (CR/PR) are comparable across all quartiles of AUC0-28d. 
Logistic regressions analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between disease response and 
exposure parameters of tisagenlecleucel determined by qPCR (Cmax and AUC0-28d) (Figure 13). The 
probability of response appears to be lower for lower exposure levels, however, no strong conclusion 
can be made due to limited number of non-responder patients. As evident from the figure data, 
several of the non-responders are clustered towards the lower end of the exposure curve which may 
further influence the shape of the curves. The model estimated odds ratios for achieving CR or CR/PR 
with two-fold increase in the AUC0-28d were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.976, 1.538) and 1.33 (95% CI: 0.992, 
1.788), respectively, suggesting no overall statistically significant impact of exposure on BOR.

parameters by qPCR, with observed proportions (Efficacy analysis set).  
Exposure-Duration of response relationship 
Kaplan-Meier plots show a favourable trend in DOR in patients with higher than the median exposure 
(median DOR not yet estimable in either exposure category). The Cox regression model showed a 
trend towards a DOR benefit with increasing exposure. Specifically, the associated HR (95% CI) for a 
2-fold increase in Cmax was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.558, 0.951) and for AUC0-28d was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.509, 
0.969). 
Summary of DOR by quartiles of exposure parameters shows that the probability estimates were 
higher for event-free survival with increasing exposure at Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12.

Exposure-Progression free survival relationship 
Similar PFS was observed in patients with low and high AUC0-28d (greater than vs. equal or less than 
median) values, with median PFS not yet estimable in high exposure category (AUC0-28d greater than 
median). The Cox regression model showed a trend towards a better PFS benefit with increasing 
exposure. Specifically, the associated HR (95% CI) for a 2-fold increase in Cmax was 0.78 (0.641, 
0.951) and for AUC0-28d was 0.80 (0.680, 0.951). 
Summary of PFS by Cmax and AUC0-28d quartiles showed no obvious difference in the event free 
probability across all quartiles.

Logistic regression analysis evaluating the impact of tisagenlecleucel exposures on CRS indicated that 
higher tisagenlecleucel exposure is associated with higher probability of any grade CRS. However, in 
Study E2202, none of r/r FL patients did experience high grade CRS (grade 3 or higher) within the 8-
week infusion. Two cellular kinetic parameters, AUC0-28d and Cmax, which represent the expansion phase 
were selected for the analysis because CRS is generally resolved within 7 days of the tisagenlecleucel 
infusion, and these parameters are useful for characterizing expansion. Based on the logistic 
regression model, the odds ratios for a two-fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-28d were 1.4 (95% CI 1.131, 
1.740) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.083, 1.7124) respectively.  
An overall trend of an increasing risk in any grade CRS within 8 weeks of infusion was observed with 
increasing AUC0-28d and Cmax based on quartile analyses for any grade CRS. Patients within the highest 
quartile of AUC0-28d and Cmax showed higher probability of having CRS than patients within the lower 
quartiles of exposure. 
Boxplots of exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC0-28d) by CRS show that patients with CRS grade ½, 
have higher ranges of exposure than patients with no CRS.

Exposure-serious neurological events relationship 
The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that there was no impact of tisagenlecleucel 
exposure (AUC0-28d and Cmax) on probability of serious neurological events (any grade). With increasing 
exposure (AUC0-28d and Cmax), no increase in the probability of any grade serious neurological events 
was observed. These non-serious and serious events were reported in 11 patients, of which 9 patients 
had these events within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion; grade ¾ AEs were reported in 3 
patients.

Analysis of exposure and time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenias 
Post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 76 patients (78.4%) had hematological disorders including cytopenias, 
mostly of grade ≥ 3 (74.2%) severity, regardless of causality. Of these 76 patients, 42 patients 
(43.3%) had AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. These AEs were reported more frequently 
within the initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion than in the periods from >8 weeks to 1 year 
after infusion and >1 year after infusion (75.3% vs. 42.7% and 11.3%). Based on Kaplan-Meier 
analysis of hematological laboratory parameters, by Month 6 the probability of resolution of all the 
cytopenias (leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia) ranged from 70% 
to 100%. 
The time to resolution of hematopoietic cytopenias post-tisagenlecleucel infusion exposure was 
presented. No definitive conclusion can be drawn due to limited number of patients with prolonged 
cytopenias. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies were conducted which is acceptable 
considering the type of medicinal product presented in the current MAA (Guideline on human cell-
based medicinal products EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006). 
Bioanalytical methods 
Validation procedures and acceptance criteria were based on the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation (2001), EMA Guidelines; ICH Guideline S6 
(R1) and USP; White papers: Neyer et al. (2006) and Shankar et al. (2008). The method validation 
from all three methods covers the regulatory expectations for validation of methods used in clinical 
trials. Relevant parameters have been included as well as cross-validation/bridging/stability and 
interference studies where applicable. All three methods are considered to be in line with regulatory 
requirements for this medicinal product. 
Pharmacokinetic methods 
The MAH has used standard NCA to describe cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in patients with FL, 
which is acceptable. qPCR was considered as the most sensitive assay for the determination of cellular 
kinetics, although flow cytometry provides a more functional measure of the transgene (measures CAR 
receptor expression). Cellular kinetic data derived from qPCR has been reported if not otherwise 
stated.  
Dose-exposure, dose-response, and exposure-response modelling has been performed for both 
efficacy and safety end points.  
Dose proportionality 
No apparent relationships between the investigated doses and the observed exposure were identified, 
which is not unexpected considering the nature of tisagenlecleucel, i.e., proliferation of the CAR T-cells 
after administration. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
The tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetic profile showed an initial rapid expansion phase achieving maximal 
expansion around Day 10, followed by a bi-exponential decline with median persistence (Tlast) of 186 
days (range 18.7 to 558). Cmax and AUC0-28d were 109% and 186% higher respectively in CR/PR 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 48/154 
 
 
 
patients relative to SD/PD patients. Median Tmax was comparable between CR/PR and SD/PD patients. 
Longer persistence was observed in responders vs. non-responders with median Tlast of 191 vs. 107 
days, respectively, and the geometric mean t1/2 was approximately 80% longer in CR/PR patients 
relative to SD/PD patients. However, these values should not be directly compared because both Tlast 
and t1/2 are dependent on the time of data cut of/follow up period. 
The MAH provided a typical cellular kinetic profile from a single FL patient where a second peak 
appears in the cellular kinetic profile, possibly reflecting a secondary expansion phase in the respective 
patient. Based upon investigation of listings of plasma concentrations, similar second peaks were 
identified in several patients, although the peak was not present in summary plots. No discussion or 
possible explanation of the second peak was provided by the MAH. 
The geometric mean transgene levels in peripheral blood (n=45) and bone marrow (n=12) were 
comparable at Month 3. The geometric mean blood to bone marrow ratio was 0.539 and is included in 
the SmPC. 
Higher expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients experiencing 
CRS grad 1 or 2 compared to patients not experiencing CRS. There is apparently no impact of CRS on 
in vivo persistence. 
Special populations 
The presented data indicate that there is no relevant impact of the intrinsic factors age (range 29 to 73 
years), body weight (range 44.3 to 127.7 kg), disease stage at study entry or baseline lactate 
dehydrogenase levels on cellular kinetics. Small subgroups and large variability in cellular kinetic 
parameters prevent firm conclusions concerning race. Female patients with FL had slightly higher 
exposure compared to males, 111% and 106% for Cmax and AUC0-28d respectively, and the exposure 
observed in patients ≥ 65 years was lower than in patients <65 years, approximately 40% and 30% 
lower for AUC0-28d and Cmax respectively. High FLIPI at enrolment was associated with 47% and 61% 
higher AUC0-28d and Cmax respectively, compared to low or intermediate FLIPI. Similarly histological 
grade at study entry demonstrated 105% and 113% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax geometric mean values, 
respectively, in patients with grade 1-2 FL relative to grade 3A FL. Further, patients who did not 
progress within 24 months following the first line anti-CD20 therapy demonstrated higher expansion 
(AUC0-28d and Cmax) compared to patients who experienced POD24. When evaluating the impact of 
refractoriness to prior therapy on cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel, a 115% higher AUC0-28d and Cmax 
geometric mean values was seen in patients who relapsed relative to patients who had refractory 
disease. Even though several of the intrinsic factors evaluated showed rather large impact on the 
cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel, the small subgroups and large variability in cellular kinetic 
parameters in study E2202 prevent firm conclusions to be made. 
Relationship between product attributes and cellular kinetics, dose or response 
No apparent relationship between product attributes and in vivo cellular kinetics has been observed.  
The cellular kinetics in patients treated with product from the Stein facility in Switzerland (n=11) had 
higher exposures compared to patients treated with products from the other three facilities. Especially 
for Cmax, the inter-individual variability was considerably higher for patients treated with product from 
the Stein facility compared to patients treated with product from the other manufacturing sites. 
Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
Overall, based on the provided data, the type of LD chemotherapy, prior bendamustine use, number of 
prior lines of therapy, prior HSCT status or type of bridging therapy does not seem to impact the 
Assessment report

cellular kinetic (Cmax and AUC0-28d) to a large extent. However, the relatively small subgroups and large 
variability in cellular kinetic parameters, prevent firm conclusions to be made. 
CRS management with Tocilizumab and corticosteroids 
Higher expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients who required 
tocilizumab to treat CRS. CAR T-cell activation is accompanied by extensive release of toxic levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines which can cause CRS. Thus, patients with higher expansion could be prone 
to develop treatment-requiring CRS. Hence, the true influence of tocilizumab on expansion cannot be 
ascertained directly since, the observation may have been confounded as tocilizumab is given for CRS 
treatment and CRS is associated with higher expansion. 
Relationship between dose, cellular kinetics, and effect 
Dose-exposure, dose-response, and exposure-response modelling was performed for both efficacy and 
safety end points. However, no modelling report describing model development was submitted, 
consequently the methods has not been assessed in detail. Since the models are mainly for descriptive 
purposes and not for dose justification or evaluation of dosing strategies, this issue has not been 
further pursued in the current application. 
Dose-response 
Based on logistic regression and summary statistics by dose quartiles, there was a trend of slightly 
lower response at the lower end of the dose range (<1.0×108 cells). Still, favourable clinical responses 
were observed across the entire recommended dose range (0.6 – 6.0 x 108 CAR-positive viable T 
cells). 
Results from Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier analyses indicates minimal difference in DOR and 
PFS depending on dose. An apparent dose-time to start of new anti-lymphoma therapy analysis 
relationship was identified based on a Cox regression model. Contrary, the Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed similar time to start of new anti-lymphoma therapy by median dose. Considering the small 
number of patients requiring new anti-lymphoma therapy (n=20) and large variability in cellular kinetic 
parameters, firm conclusions cannot be made. 
At the higher doses, the logistic regression analysis shows a relatively flat relationship between 
probability of any grade CRS and dose. Overall, the results indicates that there is no apparent 
increased risk of CRS with higher CAR-positive viable T cell doses, although there appears from the 
logistic regression model, that the risk of CRS is slightly lower at the lower end of the dosing interval 
(32% risk at lowest dose quartile (≤1.4×108) compared to ~54% at all other dose quartiles). There 
seems to be no apparent impact of dose on neurological events and time to resolution of cytopenias. 
Exposure-response 
The presented exposure-response analyses should not be interpreted as exposure-response analyses 
in its traditional sense, because the “exposure” for CAR-T products is dependent on the drug response. 
High exposure could be considered an expression of the drug response rather than the causal driver of 
the drug response. Thus, these analyses are mainly descriptions of the correlation between two 
variables partly expressing the same information. The exposure-efficacy analyses revealed an apparent 
exposure-response relationship, with DOR being longer in patients with exposure above the median 
exposure (Cmax and AUC0-28d). The exposure-BOR analysis shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC0-28d) 
was higher in responding patients compared to non-responding patients. Due to few non-responding 
patients with evaluable Cmax (n=4), as well as high inter individual variability, the findings should be 
interpreted with caution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 50/154 
 
 
 
The results of logistic regression analysis for exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC0 - 28d) and CRS, 
indicates higher probability of any grade CRS with increasing transgene expansion, i.e. higher 
tisagenlecleucel exposures. Anti-cytokine therapies were administered according to a treatment 
algorithm to solve adverse drug reactions regarding CRS (see Clinical Safety). Logistic regression 
analysis indicates no impact of exposure on neurological events. Concerning cytopenias, although 
there seems to be no apparent impact of exposure on time to resolution of cytopenias, it is difficult to 
draw any definitive conclusions due to limited number of patients experiencing long term cytopenias. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The cellular kinetics in FL patients have been characterised and showed higher expansion in CR/PR 
patients relative to SD/PD patients. Longer persistence was observed in responders vs. non-
responders, however, the measures of persistence (Tlast and t1/2) should not be directly compared 
between responders and non-responders because they are both dependent on the time of data cut 
of/follow up period. 
The impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cellular kinetics were assessed using cellular kinetic 
parameters determined from NCA. The small subgroups and large variability in cellular kinetic 
parameters in study E2202 prevent firm conclusions to be made concerning impact of intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors on cellular kinetics.  
Dose-exposure, dose-response, and exposure-response modelling was performed for both efficacy and 
safety end points. Considering the nature of tisagenlecleucel, i.e., proliferation of the CAR T-cells after 
administration, the lack of relationship between the investigated doses and the observed exposure is 
not unexpected. A trend of slightly lower response at the lower end of the dose range of 
tisagenlecleucel (<1.0×108 cells) was observed, still, favourable clinical responses were observed 
across the entire recommended dose range. The exposure-response analyses should not be interpreted 
as exposure-response analyses in its traditional sense, because the “exposure” for CAR-T products is 
dependent on the drug response. High exposure could be considered an expression of the drug 
response rather than the causal driver of the drug response. Thus, these analyses are mainly 
descriptions of the correlation between two variables partly expressing the same information. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal dose-response studies have been carried out for the indication follicular lymphoma. The 
recommended dose for the main study CCTL019E2202 is a single infusion of 0.6 – 6.0 x 108 CAR-
positive viable T cells, which is based on data from studies in CLL, ALL and NHL. The dose-response, 
dose-safety, and dose-cellular kinetics analyses were performed using the data obtained from r/r 
DLBCL patients (data cut-off [DCO] date: 8-March-2017) in Phase 2 study (Study C2201) to assess the 
impact of dose on exposure, response, and selected safety endpoints in order to select safe and 
efficacious doses for use in the prescribing setting (commercial) and Study E2202. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
The primary evidence of efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in FL is obtained from one pivotal phase 2, single 
arm, multicenter open label registration study called E2202. The study was designed to determine the 
efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel (product code: CTL019) in adult patients with r/r FL.

The single arm study E2202 had the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-treatment, Treatment 
and Follow-up. During the Screening phase and prior to enrolment into the study, a patient’s white 
blood cells were collected via leukapheresis. In the Pre-treatment phase, the patient could undergo 
optional bridging therapy and LD chemotherapy. The Treatment and Follow-up Phase included 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, and safety and efficacy follow-up. After the end of this study, patients who 
have received tisagenlecleucel infusion will continue to be followed for long-term safety, efficacy and 
survival under the long-term follow-up protocol CCTL019A2205B for 15 years post infusion per health 
authority guidelines. 
Bridging therapy was administered in some cases, and adhered to the recommendations concerning 
prohibited medications described under concomitant therapies, below.  
A PET-CT scan was performed after bridging therapy and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, except 
when the bridging therapy consisted of steroids only. Patients with no measurable disease at baseline 
after bridging therapy still received tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, all patients were required to receive LD chemotherapy. This step was 
to be omitted in case of significant cytopenia (e.g. WBC <1000 cells/μL, ALC <200 cells/μL) or any 
condition that, in the Investigator’s opinion, precluded LD chemotherapy. The purpose of this 
chemotherapy was to induce lymphopenia to facilitate engraftment and homeostatic expansion of the 
administered CAR-positive viable T-cells. 
Lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy started 1 week before tisagenlecleucel infusion so that the CAR-
positive viable T-cells were given 2 to 6 days after completion of the LD chemotherapy. The LD 
chemotherapy start date varied based on the selected chemotherapy. For LD chemotherapy, 
cyclophosphamide-based regimens were preferred agents due to the vast experience with the use of 
these agents in facilitating adoptive immunotherapy. The first option as LD regimen was fludarabine 
(25 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 3 doses) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 3 doses starting with 
the first dose of fludarabine). If there was previous grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with 
cyclophosphamide, or the patient demonstrated resistance to a previous cyclophosphamide-containing 
regimen, then a regimen with bendamustine 90 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 2 days was allowed. No other 
regimen was allowed for LD chemotherapy. 
Premedication was recommended prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, as side effects from T cell infusion 
can include fever, chills and/or nausea. All patients should be pre-medicated with acetaminophen 
(paracetamol) and diphenhydramine or another H1 antihistamine. These medications can be repeated 
every 6 hours as needed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed if the patient 
continues to have fever not relieved with acetaminophen (paracetamol). Steroids should NOT be used 
for premedication. It is recommended that patients not receive systemic corticosteroids other than 
physiologic replacement, except for serious emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on 
tisagenlecleucel cell expansion and function. 
The tisagenlecleucel product was intended to be prepared and released by the manufacturing facility to 
the study site approximately 4-6 weeks after manufacturing had commenced, provided all required 
safety and quality release criteria had been met. Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous cellular 
immunotherapy product. The recommended dose for adult patients with r/r FL is 0.6 to 6.0 × 108 CAR-
positive viable T-cells administered via a single infusion. Concurrent use of systemic steroids or 
immunosuppressant medications was prohibited except if required for physiologic replacement of 
hydrocortisone, or in the case of a life-threatening emergency, since this could have had an adverse 
effect of tisagenlecleucel cell expansion and function.

The safety and efficacy follow-up lasted for at least 24 months. For all patients who received 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, additional survival followup was to be performed to determine survival status 
every 3 months. Efficacy was evaluated using PET/CT/MRI at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 post-infusion 
and every 6 months thereafter, until EOS, (EOS is defined as when all patients have completed their 
Month 24 evaluation or discontinued prematurely). Also, onsite assessments were to be performed at 
any time disease progression or relapse was suspected, until disease progression or relapse, start of 
new anticancer therapies, death, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent. After the end of this study, 
patients who have received tisagenlecleucel infusion will continue to be followed for long-term safety, 
efficacy and survival under the long-term follow-up protocol CCTL019A2205B for 15 years post 
infusion. 
Concomitant therapies:  
The patient was to notify the investigational site about any medications he/she takes. All clinically 
significant prescription and nonprescription medication, excluding vitamins, and herbal and nutritional 
supplements, and procedure-related (inpatient or outpatient) medications taken by the patient during 
the 30 days prior to screening was to be recorded. At every visit following the screening visit up to the 
end of the study, concomitant medications were to be recorded in the medical record and on the 
appropriate CRF. During selected trial phases, concomitant medication collection was to be modified to 
capture tisagenlecleucel-related toxicity, severity, interventions and response/resolution following 
intervention. Any additions, deletions, or changes of these medications was to be documented. 
The following guidelines must be adhered to during the study: 
• Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) should be avoided due to the potential 
to worsen CRS symptoms. Short acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) should not be 
given within 72 hours of tisagenlecleucel infusion and long acting G-CSF should not be given within 10 
days of tisagenlecleucel infusion. The effects of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on the 
other hand, are unknown. 
• Steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be used as pre-medication for 
tisagenlecleucel therapy or following tisagenlecleucel infusion, except as required for physiological 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy, or under life threatening circumstances. Use of steroids with blood 
product administration should be eliminated just prior to and following tisagenlecleucel if possible or at 
least minimized. 
• Patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms attributable to CRS should be managed with 
supportive care and administration of tocilizumab.

acting growth factors or drugs used for cell mobilization (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor/filgrastim, plerixafor) is not necessary and should be stopped at least 5 days before the 
leukapheresis procedure. Short-acting drugs used to treat leukemia or lymphoma (eg, hydroxyurea, 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors) should not be given within 3 days before the leukapheresis procedure. Other 
cytotoxic drugs, including low-dose daily or weekly maintenance chemotherapy, should not be given 
within 2 weeks before leukapheresis. Pegylated asparaginase should be stopped at least 4 weeks 
before leukapheresis. Clofarabine should not be administered within 8 weeks before leukapheresis 
collection. Vincristine should not be administered within 2 weeks before leukapheresis. It is 
recommended holding intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy before leukapheresis collection. If clinically 
indicated, IT cytarabine may be given and leukapheresis collection started any time following IT 
cytarabine. Leukapheresis collection may be started 1 week or more after IT methotrexate. T-cell lytic 
agents (eg, alemtuzumab) should not be administered within 8 weeks before leukapheresis collection. 
Therapeutic doses of steroids should be stopped at least 3 days before leukapheresis. Physiological 
replacement doses of steroids are allowed, up to 12 mg/m2/d hydrocortisone or equivalent in pediatric 
patients, up to 40 mg/m2/d hydrocortisone or equivalent in adult patients, or as specified in Clinical 
Trial Protocol. Immunomodulatory drugs should be stopped at least 2 weeks before leukapheresis. 
These include checkpoint inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies and small molecule modulators). At least 
12 weeks should have passed from allogeneic stem cell transplant at the time of leukapheresis. Donor 
lymphocyte infusions should be completed at least 4 weeks before leukapheresis. If an allogeneic stem 
cell transplant occurs after leukapheresis collection, the leukapheresis material cannot be used. Any 
systemic drug used to prevent or treat grade 2 to 4 acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) or extensive 
chronic GVHD should be stopped at least 2 weeks before leukapheresis (eg, calcineurin inhibitors, 
methotrexate or other chemotherapy drugs, mycophenolate, rapamycin, thalidomide, 
immunosuppressive antibodies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor α, anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-6R). Topical 
steroids for localized treatment of GVHD are allowed. If grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD or extensive chronic 
GVHD develops after leukapheresis collection, the leukapheresis material cannot be used. 
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel as measured by complete response rate (CRR) determined 
by independent review committee (IRC). The study was considered successful if the lower bound of the 
2-sided exact CI for ORR was >15%, so that the null hypothesis that the CRR was less than or equal to 
15% could be rejected. The null hypothesis employed a 1-sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance. 
The reference CR rate of 15% used for hypothesis testing was defined based on the observed CRR 
(14%) for idelalisib in r/r FL after two lines of therapy (Salles et al 2017). Idelalisib was the therapy 
with best CRR among the approved and widely used treatment options for r/r FL after two or more 
lines of treatment at time of study set up.  
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel as measured by additional efficacy measures, 
including overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
To evaluate safety of tisagenlecleucel 
To characterize the in vivo cellular kinetics (levels, expansion, persistence) of tisagenlecleucel 
transduced cells into target tissues (blood, bone marrow, and other tissues if available) and 
CD3+ tisagenlecleucel cells in peripheral blood, summarized by clinical response 
To characterize the incidence and prevalence of tisagenlecleucel immunogenicity (humoral and 
cellular)

• 
To characterize the impact of pre-existing and treatment induced immunogenicity (cellular and 
humoral) on cellular kinetics, efficacy, and safety 
To describe the effect of tisagenlecleucel therapy on patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
Exploratory objectives: 
The current CSR contains only those exploratory assessments that were evaluated at the time of the 
current DCO, namely: 
•  Characterize B-cell levels and relationship with clinical response 
•  Summarize rituximab PK and explore the relationship between rituximab PK and clinical 
response 
•  Describe composition of T-cell subsets (immunophenotyping in peripheral blood), summarized 
by clinical response 
•  Describe the profile of blood soluble immune factors (e.g. IL-6, gamma interferon) and their 
correlation with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint was Complete response rate (CRR) determined by an Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) in the efficacy analysis set (EAS) based on Lugano 2014 classification response 
criteria (Cheson et al 2014). 
CRR was defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion 
until progressive disease or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever came first. Patients in this 
study who were of unknown clinical response were treated as non-responders. The analysis of the 
primary endpoint was performed on the Enrolled set, Tisagenlecleucel infused set, and per-protocol set 
(PPS) using the same methodology, as well as on the mEAS and EAS excluding patients who achieved 
CR at the radiologic assessment at baseline per IRC. 
Efficacy was evaluated using PET/CT/MRI at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 post-infusion and every 6 
months thereafter, until EOS, (EOS is defined as when all patients have completed their Month 24 
evaluation or discontinued prematurely). Also, onsite assessments were to be performed at any time 
disease progression or relapse was suspected, until disease progression or relapse, start of new 
anticancer therapies, death, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent. After the end of this study, 
patients who have received tisagenlecleucel infusion will continue to be followed for long-term safety, 
efficacy and survival under the long-term follow-up protocol CCTL019A2205B for 15 years post 
infusion. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints included ORR, DOR, PFS, OS, safety, PK (cellular kinetics), immunogenicity, 
and PRO. IRC assessment was used in the main analysis of secondary endpoints that involved disease 
response. All analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints were performed on the EAS. In addition, 
selected analyses were performed for the mEAS, Tisagenlecleucel infused set, and/or for the Enrolled 
set. 
•  ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR or PR. The ORR was summarized 
along with the 2-sided 95% exact Clopper-Pearson CI. 
•  DOR applies to patients whose BOR was CR or PR. It is defined as the time from the date of 
first documented disease response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022

death due to FL. If a patient did not have an event prior to the earliest censoring event, DOR 
was censored at the date of the last adequate assessment on or prior to the earliest censoring 
event. The censoring reason could be: ongoing without an event, lost to follow-up, withdrew 
consent, new anticancer therapy (incl. HSCT), adequate assessments no longer available. If 
there were any patients who responded to tisagenlecleucel but experienced death due to any 
reason other than FL, death due to a reason other than FL was considered as a competing risk 
event to other events of interest (progression or death due to FL). In this analysis, the median 
DOR (if appropriate) as well as proportion of patients without events following response 
(progression or death due to FL) at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, etc. were presented with 95% CI using 
the cumulative incidence function (CIF). Distribution of DOR was also estimated using KM 
methodology, in which, the competing risk event, i.e. death due to reason other than FL was 
censored at the date of the last assessment with response of CR or PR on or prior to the 
censoring event. As HSCT is an important treatment option in responding patients, the date of 
HSCT was considered as censoring date, instead of censoring at the last tumor assessment 
date. Distribution of DOR was estimated using the KM method. DOR was summarized for 
patients with CR only as well as with CR or PR. 
•  PFS is defined as the time from the date of tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of first 
documented progression or death due to any cause. Progression free survival was also 
analyzed as time from enrollment to the date of event defined as the first documented 
progression or death due to any cause for Enrolled set. In case a patient did not have 
progression or death prior to the earliest censoring event, PFS was censored at the date of the 
last adequate assessment on or prior to the earliest censoring event. The censoring reasons 
and PFS estimates by KM methodology are the same as for DOR. Patients who proceeded to 
HSCT after tisagenlecleucel were censored at the time of HSCT. PFS will be estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method and the median PFS as well as proportion of patients without event at 3, 
6, 9, and 12 months will be presented along with 95% confidence interval. 
•  OS was defined as the time from the date of tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of death due 
to any reason. If a death was not observed by the DCO, OS was censored at the date of last 
contact. The distribution function of OS was estimated using the KM method. Overall survival 
was also analyzed as time from enrollment to the date of death due to any reason for Enrolled 
set. 
•  Summary scores of PRO measured by SF-36 version 2, EQ-5D-3L and FACT-Lym QoL 
questionnaires. 
Sample size 
The proposed sample size of 90 patients was based on the null hypothesis of CRR ≤ 15% and 
assuming an underlying CRR of 30%, with a power of 90%, using a 2-look Lan-DeMets group 
sequential design with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary and an exact confidence interval at one-sided 
cumulative 0.025 level of significance (see also section below on interim analyses). With these 
assumptions a CRR of 21/90=23.3% would be needed to claim success. The reference CR rate for 
hypothesis testing was defined based on the observed CRR (14%) for the two PI3K inhibitors idelalisib 
and copanlisib in refractory FL (Salles et al 2017, FDA 2017).  
Assuming 20% enrolled patients would not be infused due to reasons such as manufacturing failure, 
worsening of patient’s condition, etc., it was estimated that at least 113 patients would need to be 
enrolled to ensure 90 patients are treated and hence would be used for the primary analysis.

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The screened set comprised all subjects who have signed informed consent and have been screened 
in the study. 
The enrolled set comprised all subjects who have been enrolled in this study, defined as the point at 
which the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the patients’ leukapheresis product is 
received and accepted by the manufacturing facility.  
The tisagenlecleucel infused set comprised all subjects who have received tisagenlecleucel.  
The efficacy analysis set (EAS) includes all subjects who have received tisagenlecleucel and had 
measurable disease at baseline per IRC. Non-measurable disease at baseline is defined as absence of 
index lesion at baseline disease evaluation (i.e. no disease at baseline).  
The modified efficacy analysis set (mEAS) includes the first 90 subjects who have received 
tisagenlecleucel and had measurable disease at baseline per IRC.  
At the time of interim analysis, the Interim Efficacy Analysis Set (IEAS) comprised all subjects who 
have received tisagenlecleucel infusion at least 166 days (i.e. 6 months considering 14 days time-
window) prior to the DCO date, had measurable disease at baseline per IRC and have either completed 
Month 6 assessment visit or discontinued efficacy follow-up earlier.  
The safety set comprised all subjects who have received tisagenlecleucel, i.e. the same subjects as 
the tisagenlecleucel infused set.  
The per-protocol set (PPS) consisted of a subset of subjects in the IEAS or EAS (at time of the 
interim and primary analysis respectively). Protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PPS 
include: No diagnosis of FL at baseline, Missing or incomplete documentation of disease, and Receiving 
a dose less than the recommended dose of 0.6× 108 tisagenlecleucel transduced viable T cells (i.e. 
total CAR-positive viable T cell count).  
The cellular kinetic analysis set (CKAS) consisted of subjects in the IEAS or EAS (at time of the 
interim and primary analysis respectively) who provide an evaluable cellular kinetic profile (at least 
one cellular kinetic parameter). The CKAS will be used for summaries (tables and figures) of cellular 
kinetic data. The tisagenlecleucel infused set will be used for listings of cellular kinetic data. Note that 
subjects may be removed from the estimation of certain CK parameters on an individual basis 
depending on the number of available samples. These subjects will be identified at the time of the 
analyses. 
The tocilizumab pharmacokinetic analysis set (TPAS) consisted of subjects in the tisagenlecleucel 
infused set who have taken at least one dose of tocilizumab and provided at least one tocilizumab PK 
concentration.  
Hypothesis – Primary Endpoint CRR 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 59/154 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was the CRR defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of 
CR recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until progressive disease as determined by IRC or start of 
new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. Patients who were of unknown clinical response were 
to be treated as non-responders.  
CRR was to be analyzed at the interim look and final look of a group sequential design, based on the 
data observed in the IEAS and the EAS, respectively. The CRR was to be summarized along with the 2-
sided exact Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CI) with coverage level determined by the O’Brien-
Fleming type α-spending approach according to Lan-DeMets as implemented in East 6.3 (Lan and 
DeMets, 1983). The study was to be considered successful if the lower bound of the 2-sided exact CI 
was greater than 15%, equivalent to that the null hypothesis that the CRR is less than or equal to 15% 
could be rejected. A p-value from a binominal exact test was to be provided. 
A sensitivity analysis was to be performed using the local investigator response assessments instead of 
the IRC assessment. The primary analysis will also be performed on the Enrolled Set, tisagenlecleucel 
infused set, and PPS using the same methodology as well as on the mEAS and EAS excluding subjects 
who achieved CR at the radiologic assessment at baseline per IRC.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
IRC assessment will be used in the main analysis of secondary endpoints that involve disease 
response. Unless otherwise specified, all analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints were to be 
performed on the IEAS and the EAS at interim and primary analysis, respectively. In addition, selected 
analyses were to be performed for the mEAS, tisagenlecleucel infused set, and/or for the Enrolled set.  
ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall disease response of CR or PR. The Best 
overall response (BOR) was defined as the best response recorded until progressive disease or start of 
new anticancer therapy or the DCO date, whichever was earlier. The ORR was to be summarized along 
with the 2-sided 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence Intervals. 
DOR, defined as the time from the date of first documented disease response (CR or PR) to the date of 
first documented progression or death due to FL. DOR was to be summarized for patients with CR only, 
as well as with CR or PR. If a patient had not had an event, duration of overall response was to be 
censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. In case a patient did not have progression or 
death due to FL prior to data cutoff, DOR was to be censored at the date of the last adequate 
assessment on or prior to the earliest censoring event. The censoring reason could be: Ongoing 
without event, Lost to follow-up, Withdrew consent, New anticancer therapy, and Adequate 
assessments no longer available.  As HSCT is an important treatment option in responding patients, it 
was seen as appropriate to consider the date of HSCT as censoring date, instead of censoring at the 
last tumour assessment date. In the main analysis of DOR, death due to reason other than FL was to 
be considered as a competing risk event to other events of interest (progression or death due to FL). 
In this analysis, the median response duration (if appropriate) as well as proportion of patients without 
events following response (progression or death due to FL) at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, etc. was to be 
presented with 95% confidence intervals using the cumulative incidence function (CIF). The 
distribution function of DOR was also to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method where the 
competing risk event, i.e. death due to reason other than FL, was censored at the date of the last 
assessment with response of CR or PR on or prior to the censoring event.  
PFS, defined as the time from the date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the first documented 
progression or death due to any cause. If a patient had not had an event, progression-free survival 
was to be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. In case a patient did not have 
progression or death prior to data cutoff, PFS was to be censored at the date of the last adequate 
assessment on or prior to the earliest censoring event. The censoring reason could be: Ongoing 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 60/154 
 
 
 
without event, Lost to follow-up, Withdrew consent, New anticancer therapy (incl. HSCT), Adequate 
assessments no longer available.  
PFS was to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the median PFS, proportion of patients 
without event at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months presented along with 95% confidence intervals. The PFS was 
also to be analyzed as time from enrollment to the date of event defined as the first documented 
progression or death due to any cause for Enrolled set.  
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to date of death 
due to any reason. If a death had not been observed by the date of analysis cutoff, OS was to be 
censored at the date of last contact. The distribution function of OS was to be estimated using the 
Kaplan Meier (KM) method, and the median OS and the proportion of patients alive at 3, 6, 12, 18, 
and 24 months with 95% confidence intervals presented. OS was also to be analyzed as time from 
enrollment to the date of death due to any reason for the Enrolled set  
Interim analyses / Multiplicity 
One interim analysis for overwhelming efficacy was planned for the study when approximately 50 
patients of the planned 90 (55.6%) have received tisagenlecleucel infusion and have either completed 
6 months from study day 1 infusion or discontinued earlier. At the interim analysis it was expected that 
all patients would have been treated, and therefore the study would not be stopped for outstanding 
efficacy regardless of the interim analysis results. An α-spending function according to Lan-DeMets 
(O’Brien-Fleming), as implemented in EAST 6.3, was to be used to construct the efficacy stopping 
boundary based on the actual number of patients included when the interim analysis would take place. 
For example, a 2-sided 99.48% exact confidence interval for CRR would need to be greater than 15% 
to declare statistical significance, and therefore a CRR of 16/50=32% would be needed to claim 
success at the interim analysis. Correspondingly, at the final analysis when 90 patients are treated and 
followed for at least 6 months, a 2-sided 95.16% exact CI would be used, requiring an CRR of 
21/90=23.3% to claim success.

Results 
Participant flow 
At the time of the DCO for the main extended follow-up analysis (29-Mar-2021), 119 patients were 
screened. Of these, 98 (84.5%) patients were enrolled in the study. Median time from screening to 
enrolment for all enrolled patients was 30 days (range 14-72 days). Only one patient was not enrolled 
due to a failure of apheresis.  
The participant flow is shown in Figure 19 below.

Recruitment 
Study E2202 was conducted in 32 sites, with patients enrolled and treated in 30 of these sites. The 
patients were enrolled across 12 countries, including Australia (3 centers), Austria (1), Belgium (1), 
Germany (3), Spain (2), France (2), United Kingdom (2), Italy (2), Japan (3), Netherlands (1), Norway 
(1), and United States of America (9). Infusion in an outpatient setting (i.e., day-care admission for 
infusion followed by ambulatory monitoring) was allowed as per Investigator’s decision. The data 
provided is based on a follow up analysis when 97 patients were infused with tisagenlecleucel and 90 
patients had either completed 12 months of follow-up from the time of infusion or had 
discontinued earlier.  
Study initiation date: 12-Nov-2018 (first patient first visit).

Conduct of the study 
No substantial amendments were made to the original protocol, dated 29-Mar-2018.  
During the study, the Independent Review Committee Charter was modified four times. These changes 
were to provide clarifying edits to the lesion location list, FGD-PET assessment guidance for timepoint 
by timepoint review, and to clarify CR and PR response assessments during global radiology review 
(Version 2); to add the Secondary Radiology Analysis review and the assessment window for bone 
marrow data was updated to align with the protocol language (Version 3); to add Secondary Analysis 
Oncology Review for patients receiving bridging therapy (Version 4).  
In the Enrolled set (n=98), protocol deviations were reported in 58 patients (59.2%); however, these 
deviations were typically minor and were not considered to impact the overall conclusions of the study. 
The most common protocol deviations reported in ≥ 10 patients fell into the following categories: 
• 
‘Other deviations’, were reported in 50 patients (51.0%). The most common subcategories 
reported in ≥ 10 patients were: 
o  18.4% of the patients missed ≥ 3 consecutive PK timepoints (qPCR and/or flow cytometry) 
In 17.3% of the patients, ≥ 3 consecutive PRO questionnaires were not collected as per 
o 
protocol 
o 
o 
In 14.3% of the patients (n=14), safety assessments were not performed as per protocol 
In 13.3% of the patients (n=13), response assessments were not performed as per 
protocol 
• 
Treatment deviations in 15 patients (15.3%) – the majority were due to ‘influenza testing not 
performed within 10 days prior to planned tisagenlecleucel infusion’ 
•  Any inclusion criteria deviation in 11 patients (11.3%) – of which, 3 patients were not r/r after 
≥ 2 lines of systemic therapy (the patients had relapsed >6 months after completion of their 
second-line of therapy), in 3 patients oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was not done, and 
in 2 patients, study procedures were performed prior to obtaining signed ICF (ECG was 
performed in 1 patient and ECG and viral test were performed in the second patient) and the 
other deviations were reported by one patient each. 
There was no impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient enrolment and study population. 
Protocol deviations during the COVID-19 pandemic occurred mainly due to patient concern (23.7%), 
lockdown (11.3%), site issue (11.3%), and patient health status (2.1%). These deviations included: 
• 
In 46 patients visits were not done at the study site due to patient concern (n=19), lockdown 
(n=10), other issues (n=10) and site issues (n=7). 
•  11 patients missed visits due to patient concern (n=5), lockdown (n=2), other issues (n=2), 
health status (n=1) and site issues (n=1) 
• 
In 9 patients assessment/procedure changed due to other reasons (n=5), site issues (n=3) 
and patient concern (n=1) 
•  1 patient discontinued the study due to COVID-19 infection 
Note: A patient could have multiple protocol deviations. 
These deviations did not have an impact on the primary efficacy endpoint at the time of the main 
extended follow-up analysis (29-mar-2021).

Numbers analysed 
The numbers of participants included in each analysis set are shown in Table 17.  
Nine patients (9.6%) were excluded from the EAS (94 patients) to form the PPS (n=85): 
•  5 patients with missing or incomplete documentation of disease at baseline - 4 patients did not 
have bone marrow assessment, but had complete radiological assessments at baseline, and 1 
patient did not undergo a PET scan, but had a CT at baseline 
•  4 patients received a dose lower than the recommended dose

The primary disease history prior antineoplastic therapies in the Enrolled set and EAS are shown in 
Table 19. The demographics of the population in the EAS and mEAS were consistent with the Enrolled 
set. 
The enrolled study population was heavily pre-treated as indicated by the median number of prior lines 
of antineoplastic therapies administered, i.e. 4.0 (range: 2 to 13), with 28.6% of the patients receiving 
≥ 5 lines (Table 19).

SD: standard deviation 
Refractory was defined as failure to respond to previous treatment (SD/PD as best response) or PD 
within 6 months of prior therapy completion. Of the enrolled patients, 76 (77.6%) of patients were 
refractory to their last line of therapy. Of which, 54 patients (55.1%) showed SD/PD as their best 
response to their most recent regimen and 22 patients (22.4%) had disease relapse within 6 months 
from completion of this last regimen. Thirty-six patients received prior HSCT, of whom 15 patients 
relapsed within 12 months from transplant. 
Commonly used prior antineoplastic therapies, i.e. anti-CD20 mAbs, alkylating agents, PI3K inhibitors, 
and HSCT are summarized in Table 20. Commonly used prior antineoplastic medications by PT in 
>20% of the patients included rituximab (100%), cyclophosphamide (94.9%), doxorubicin (89.8%), 
vincristine (68.4%), bendamustine (67.3%) etoposide (54.1%), prednisone (51.0%), cytarabine 
(44.9%), prednisolone (42.9%), dexamethasone (30.6%), melphalan (31.6%), carmustine (30.6%), 
vincristine sulfate (27.6%), ifosfamide (26.5%), obinutuzumab (26.5%), cisplatin (25.5%), 
lenalidomide (22.4%), and carboplatin (21.4%). Twenty-seven patients (27.6%) in the Enrolled set 
received prior radiotherapy, mostly in therapeutic setting (n=23).  
Concomitant medications administered were representative of those routinely prescribed for adult 
patients with FL, treatment and prophylaxis of AEs related to bridging/LD therapy, and treatment of 
CRS and associated events as recommended by the study protocol. 
At the time of the current DCO: 
•  All patients in the Infused set with one exception received non-study concomitant medications 
• 
The most commonly used concomitant medications (in >30% of patients) by ATC class 
included the below, presented in decreasing order: 
o  Anti-infectives for systemic use in 93.8% of patients (primarily Bactrim (42.3%)) 
o  Alimentary tract and metabolism medications in 79.4% of patients (primarily 
ondansetron (32.0%)) 
o  Nervous system medications in 71.1% (primarily paracetamol (53.6%)) 
o  Blood and blood-forming organs medications in 58.8% (primarily 
enoxaparin/enoxaparin sodium (22.7%)) 
o  Dermatologicals in 50.5% (primarily aciclovir (27.8%)) 
o  Musculoskeletal system medications in 50.5% (primarily allopurinol (40.2%))

o  Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents in 47.4% (primarily filgrastim 
(25.8%), which was given following the restrictions defined by the protocol with 
respect to permitted and prohibited concomitant medications. 
o  Cardiovascular system medications in 37.1% of patients 
•  17 patients (17.5%) in the Infused set received anti-cytokine medication for CRS. All 17 
patients received tocilizumab and 4 of them received corticosteroids in addition. 
Table 19: Key prior antineoplastic therapies (enrolled set) 
Bridging therapy 
Of the 97 patients infused, 44 patients (45.4%) received optional antineoplastic bridging therapy prior 
to tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most commonly used agents (in ≥ 5% of patients) were rituximab 
(21.6%), dexamethasone (11.3%), gemcitabine (10.3%), oxaliplatin (7.2%), prednisolone (7.2%), 
etoposide (6.2%), cyclophosphamide (5.2%), and vincristine (5.2%). In 5 patients, only 
corticosteroids were administered as bridging therapy. Furthermore, two patients received bridging 
radiotherapy – one patient received only radiotherapy and the other patient received radiotherapy and 
corticosteroids. 
Lymphadenopathy chemotherapy 
All infused patients received LD chemotherapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. Ninety-two (94.8%) of 
patients received fludarabine + cyclophosphamide, and the remaining 5 patients (5.2%) received 
bendamustine. 
Patient exposure to tisagenlecleucel 
The recommended tisagenlecleucel dose range in this study was 0.6 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-
cells.

Table 20: Tisagenlecleucel dose administration (tisagenlecleucel infused set) 
1 Recommended dose range is 0.6 to 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells 
SD: standard deviation 
Six patients were infused with a tisagenlecleucel batch provided upon the request of the Principal 
Investigator under the exceptional provision procedure for final product that did not meet all 
predefined release specifications (OOS). 
• 
Four patients received tisagenlecleucel products that were OOS due to a lower dose than 
specified as per protocol (OOS range: 0.1 to 0.46×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells) 
•  One patient received tisagenlecleucel product that was OOS due to lower viability at 51.7% 
(specified: ≥ 70%) but with an overall dose of CAR-positive viable T-cells in the targeted dose 
range (dose received: 0.8×108 cells). 
•  One patient received tisagenlecleucel product that was OOS due to a higher dose; however, 
the site was instructed by Novartis to infuse 91% of the volume and the patient was 
administered a dose of 6.0×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells that was within specification 
Note: one patient received only one of the two infusion bags; (actual dose received: 1.45×108 CAR-
positive viable T-cells). 
One patient was not enrolled due to a failure to obtain an apheresis. 
The median time from screening to enrolment in study E2202 for all enrolled patients was 30 days 
(range: 14-72). The median time from enrolment to infusion was 46 days (range: 23-127). The 
median duration of follow-up from infusion to the DCO date of 29-mar-2021 was 16.59 months (range: 
10.3-25.7) for the Enrolled set and 16.85 months (range: 10.3-25.7) for the EAS.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was met at the interim analysis (corresponding to a DCO date of 26-May-2020), 
conducted when at least 50 patients had received tisagenlecleucel infusion and had either completed 6 
months of follow-up or had discontinued earlier for any reason, with a CRR of 65.4% (34/52; 99.5% 
CI: 45.1, 82.4). This result was statistically significant at a 1-sided critical alpha level of 0.0025 to 
reject the null hypothesis (H0) CRR ≤ 15%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 69/154 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the results of the primary analysis (corresponding to a DCO date of 28-Sep-2020), 
conducted when 94 patients had either completed 6 months of follow-up or had discontinued for any 
reason, confirmed these findings, with a CRR per IRC in the EAS of 66.0% (95% CI: 55.5, 75.4). 
Complete response rate 
The CRR results of this analysis, with a median duration of follow-up of 16.85 months (range: 10.3 to 
25.7) from the time of the infusion to the DCO date, were consistent with both the interim analysis and 
the primary analysis.

a new anticancer treatment before Month 3. 
For ORR the 95% exact Clopper-Pearson CIs are displayed. 
The CRR per local Investigator assessment was 72.3% (95% CI: 62.2, 81.1), which is consistent with 
the IRC assessment. Similarly, the ORR 90.4% (95% CI:82.6, 95.5) compared to 86.2% (95% 
CI:77.5,92.4). Results consistent with that of the EAS were observed when CRR was analysed across 
the different analysis sets (Table 23).

The CRRs in the subgroups ranged from 58.3 to 87.9% and were similar to the overall study 
population in the EAS, in particular for these high-risk subgroups: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients refractory to last line of prior therapy (68.9%) 
Patients with bulky disease at baseline (67.2%) 
Patients who were double refractory (66.2%) 
Patients who received bridging therapy (65.9%) 
Patients who received prior HSCT (65.7%) 
Patients with high FLIPI (63.2%) and high LDH (61.0%) 
Patients who received >4 prior lines of treatment (59.3%) 
Patients belonging to POD24 group (59.0%) 
Patients with high total metabolic tumour volume (TMTV) showed a decreased CRR (40%), although in 
this subgroup the ORR was less impacted (75%). These estimates should be interpreted with caution 
given the small number of patients (n=20). The TMTV is a quantitative tumour burden parameter, 
obtained from FDG-PET/CT. A TMTV value >510 cm3 was used as threshold to define high TMTV 
(Delfau-Larue et al 2018).

Secondary endpoints 
ORR per IRC assessment.  
The ORR in the EAS was 86.2% (81/94 patients, 95% CI: 77.5, 92.4) per IRC assessment and 90.4% 
(85 patients, 95% CI: 82.6, 95.5) per local Investigator assessment, demonstrating consistency in the 
results.  Among 31 patients with initial PR per IRC assessment, 15 patients converted to CR (i.e. 
achieved BOR of CR) which occurred within approximately 6 months post-tisagenlecleucel infusion for 
the majority of these 15 patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 72/154 
 
 
 
 
 
The ORR results of this extended follow-up analysis (DCO: 29-Mar-2021) were consistent with the 
interim (82.7%) and primary analyses (86.2%). Data from a more recent DCO (03-Aug-2021) was 
provided in the second assessment round (see ancillary analyses section). No new responders were 
observed with longer follow-up. Therefore, ORR remained unchanged.  
The ORR results were driven by high CRR, and the robustness of the ORR (per IRC assessment) was 
confirmed by the results of predefined sensitivity and supplemental analyses using the mEAS (85.6%), 
PPS (87.1%), and Tisagenlecleucel infused set (86.6%) (Table 23). 
DOR 
At the time of the main analysis (DCO: 29-Mar-2021), the median DOR per IRC was not reached. 
Responses (CR or PR) per IRC review in the EAS set were achieved in 81 patients, with the estimated 
probability of remaining in response for 9 months being 76.0% (95% CI: 64.6, 84.2) (Table 24). Out 
of the 81 responders, 59 patients were censored. The reasons for censoring in these 59 patients were 
as follows: 56 patients were ongoing without an event, 1 patient withdrew consent, 1 patient was lost 
to follow-up, and 1 patient was censored for starting new anticancer therapy other than HSCT.

DOR for CR only, based on IRC 
Of the 65 patients who achieved CR, 11 patients experienced disease relapse (occurring 83 to 476 
days after the onset of response). Of the 16 patients who achieved PR, 11 patients experienced 
disease relapse. The estimated probability of remaining in response for patients achieving CR was 
86.5% at Month 9 vs 25.9% for patients achieving PR as BOR. The median DOR for patients with CR 
was not reached Figure 22. These results demonstrate that CR translates to prolonged DOR, when 
compared to the DOR of patients achieving only PR as BOR.

PFS based on IRC 
At the time of the DCO of 29-Mar-2021, the median PFS per IRC in the EAS was 18.4 months (95% CI: 
12.3, NE); however, this should be interpreted with caution since there were limited numbers of 
patients remaining at risk after Month 18. 
There were 34 PFS events in total (disease progression or death). The estimated progression-free 
probability was 67.0% (95% CI: 56.0, 75.8) at Month 12 (Table 25). The KM plot for PFS per IRC 
assessment is presented in Figure 23.

The estimated PFS for patients achieving CR was 85.5% at Month 12 vs 25.7% for patients achieving 
PR as BOR; the median PFS for patients achieving PR was 6.0 months (Figure 24). These results 
demonstrate that CR translates also into prolonged PFS, when compared with PFS of patients achieving 
PR as BOR. 
PFS results as assessed by local Investigator were consistent with IRC assessment. PFS in the Enrolled 
set were consistent with the EAS; however, in the Enrolled set, the median PFS per IRC was not 
reached.

During the procedure, data from a subsequent DCO (03-Aug-2021) was provided. 12-month PFS 
remained unchanged from the Mar-29-2021 DCO. Median PFS increased from 18.4 months to 29.5 
months at this later DCO, although a low number of patients remained at risk after month 25. For 
further details, see the ancillary analyses section.  
OS 
The median OS was not reached at the time of the 29-Mar-2021 DCO. Seven deaths had occurred in 
the study (Table 26). (See section on Safety) 
In the EAS, the estimated probability of survival was 95.3% (95% CI: 88.0, 98.2) at Month 12 and 
91.6% (95% CI: 81.7, 96.2) at Month 18 (Table 26).

Overall survival was also analyzed in the Enrolled set (from enrollment), the Tisagenlecleucel infused 
set, and the mEAS, all of which yielded similar results. 
During the procedure, data from a subsequent DCO (03-Aug-2021) was provided. In the EAS, 12-
month OS remained unchanged compared to the previous DCO. Please see ancillary analyses section. 
Summary of primary and secondary endpoints for the mEAS. 
The mEAS comprised of the first 90 consecutively infused patients who received tisagenlecleucel and 
had measurable disease at baseline per IRC. These 90 patients were followed for 12 months after 
infusion or have discontinued earlier. Efficacy analyses are additionally provided on the mEAS. The 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the population in the mEAS were consistent with 
the EAS and Enrolled set. 
In summary: 
•  CR per IRC in the mEAS was 68.9% (62 patients: 95% CI: 58.3, 78.2). There were 15 patients 
(16.7%) who achieved PR as best response. 
•  ORR per IRC was 85.6% (77 patients) (95% CI: 76.6, 92.1). 
•  Median DOR was not reached. The estimated event-free probability among responders per IRC 
was 76.4% (95% CI: 64.7, 84.6) at Month 9. 
•  Median PFS per IRC was 18.4 months (95% CI: 12.3, NE); however, this should be interpreted 
with caution since there were limited numbers of patients remaining at risk after Month 18. 
The estimated event-free probability was 68.0% (95% CI: 56.8, 76.8) at Month 12. 
•  Median OS was not reached at the time of the data cut-off. The estimated probability of 
survival was 96.4% (95% CI: 89.1, 98.8) at Month 12 and 92.6% (95% CI: 82.6, 96.9) at 
Month 18. 
Treatment post tisagenlecleucel 
Seventeen patients (17.5%) in the Tisagenlecleucel infused set received at least one new 
antineoplastic medication post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, mostly due to stable disease or progressive 
disease. 
The majority of the patients (n=14) received antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents like 
lenalidomide (n=9), rituximab (n=8), idelalisib (n=4) and etoposide (n=3). In three patients, 
corticosteroids were administered.

Two patients (2.1%) received allogeneic HSCT. 
The effect of tisagenlecleucel therapy on patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
The results of patient report outcomes (PRO) were assessed in the EAS to further evaluate the impact 
of tisagenlecleucel on patients’ health-related quality of life (QoL). The results in this section 
summarize the PRO results from the patients who completed the PRO assessment from the FAS 
(tisagenlecleucel infused population (n=97). 
Three questionnaires were used in this study to capture patient reported outcomes (PROs) at 
Screening, and months 3, 6, 9,1 2, 18, 24 and the end of study for each patient. These were SF-36 
version 2, FACT-Lym and EQ-5D-3L. For patients who relapse or progress, assessments of patient-
reported outcomes (SF-36 version 2; EQ-5D-3L; FACT-Lym) were continued for the subsequent two 
visits. PRO data was collected by electronic devices (i.e. tablet) and the questionnaires were 
administered by the patient themselves.  
FACT-Lym, SF-36v2 and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires: 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) is a questionnaire to assess the 
quality of life in patients with Lymphoma. It consists of a general quality of life questionnaire (FACT-G) 
and a condition specific module called Lym. The FACT-Lym is QOL questionnaire which is validated in 
patients with lymphoma. It includes a module which assesses specific concerns of patients with 
lymphoma. The FACT-G has 27 items that patients are asked to respond to on a Likert-scale by 
choosing one of five standardised response options, (not at all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very 
much). The general module consists of five domains (Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well- Being, 
Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being and Additional Concerns). The Lym module consists of 15 
items that patients are asked to respond to  on the same five-point Likert-scale. 
The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a widely used and extensively studied questionnaire to 
measure health-related quality of life among healthy patients and patients with acute and chronic 
conditions. It consists of eight domains that can be scored individually: Physical Functioning, Role-
Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role- Emotional, and Mental Health. 
Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component 
Summary (MCS) can also be computed. 
The EQ-5D-3L is a widely used, self-administered questionnaire designed to assess health status in 
adults. The questionnaire is divided into two distinct sections. The first section is a questionnaire that 
assesses five dimensions, by one item each (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression). The patients respond to each of these items by choosing one of the following 
response options “no problem,” “some problem,” or “extreme problem.” A composite health index is 
then defined by combining the levels for each dimension.  
The second section of the questionnaire measures self-rated (global) health status utilizing a vertically 
oriented visual analogue scale (VAS) where 100 represents the “best possible health state” and 0 
represents the “worst possible health state.” Respondents are asked to rate their current health by 
placing a mark along this continuum. 
The minimal clinically important difference (MID) is defined as the smallest difference in quality of life 
(QoL) that patients perceive as beneficial and that mandates a change in management.  
Minimally clinically important differences (MID) ranged from 5.5 to 11 for the FACT-Lym TOI, 6.5 to 
11.2 for the FACT-Lym total score, 3 to 7 for FACT-G, and 2.9-5.4 for FACT-Lym-S.

For the SF-36, MIDs were 3 for both PCS (physical component score) and MCS (mental component 
score). 
The FACT Lym scores showed improvement in QoL over time in the majority of patients post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion. Similar results were observed for the SF-36 questionnaire results (Figure 26).

Ancillary analyses 
Updated Efficacy Results in E2202 (DCO 03-Aug-2021): 
Further efficacy data from a subsequent DCO of 03-Aug-2021, corresponding to additional 4 months of 
median follow-up (median follow up: 21 months in the EAS, range: 14-30), were submitted during the 
procedure.  
No new responders and no new conversions from PR to CR were observed with longer follow-up. 
Therefore, CRR and ORR remain unchanged with the DCO of 03-Aug-2021 for the EAS, infused set and 
enrolled set. CRR and ORR by local assessment were consistent with the IRC assessment (Table 28,

Real world data:  
To contextualise the findings presented in the pivotal clinical study E2202, the MAH carried out two 
analyses of real-world data, ReCORD and Flatiron in addition to a systematic literature review.  
ReCORD 
The non-interventional retrospective cohort study of treatment outcomes among adult patients with 
refractory or relapsed FL (ReCORD-FL) based on current standard of care, aimed to provide patient-
level data for an indirect comparison with the single-arm tisagenlecleucel E2202 clinical trial. ReCORD 
(A Retrospective Cohort Study of Treatment Outcomes Among Adult Patients with Refractory or 
Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma). ReCORD included patient level data from centres in Europe and North 
America where 70% of the centres also participated in study E2202.  
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 85/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods: 
ReCORD is a retrospective medical record review in a cohort of patients from multiple centers in 
Europe and North America. To obtain an adequate sample size and to include patients treated with 
different regimens reflecting evolving management strategies in clinical practice over the years (e.g., 
chemo-immunotherapy and PI3K inhibitors), data was collected from patients with r/r FL treated 
between 1998 and 2020. No initial diagnoses of FL before January 1, 1998 were permitted as a key 
treatment in the FL landscape, rituximab, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 1997 and 1998, respectively, for r/r FL. Based on the 
study design, patients diagnosed and managed before the availability of rituximab were excluded. 
Patient-level data was abstracted and provided by physicians or their designated clinical staff from 
Europe and North America (10 sites across France, Germany, Spain, UK, Canada and USA), who have 
been/are treating patients with FL and have agreed to participate in the ReCORD study.  
Wherever feasible, the ReCORD study adopted the same inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria as study 
E2202. The index date must have occurred during the period between January 1, 2000 and December 
31, 2018; initial FL diagnosis must have occurred before the index date but not earlier than January 1, 
1998. Patients could be living or deceased at the time of record abstraction. 
Statistical Methods  
A model for the propensity score, the probability of enrollment into the E2202 study conditional on 
observed baseline covariates, was estimated using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach 
to fitting a logistic regression to the outcome data, employing a robust sandwich variance estimator to 
account for the correlation between repeated observations on the same patient. This was done since 
each patient may be eligible for inclusion at the start of more than one line of therapy and contribute 
multiple correlated observations. The fitted logistic regression was be used to derive a point estimate 
of the propensity score (PS) for each patient in ReCORD at each eligible line of therapy. The potential 
confounders that were considered for inclusion in the PS-model at each line of therapy were:  
•  Age at treatment initiation 
•  Region (Europe or North America) 
•  Gender 
•  History of autologous stem cell transplant 
•  Number of previous lines of systemic treatment 
•  Group stage at initial FL diagnosis 
•  Number of months between initial FL diagnosis and initiation of index treatment 
•  Sites of nodal involvement at treatment initiation 
•  Refractory to systemic therapies 
• 
Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) of initiation of first line of treatment 
For each patient the eligible line of therapy (LoT) associated with the highest PS was to be selected, 
and the PS model recalculated based on this using a logististic regression adjusting for the above 
variables to balance the baseline covariates across the two cohorts. A PS was then to be estimated for 
each patient in the ReCORD study, an estimate of their probability of being included in the E2202 
study given their baseline covariates at the selected LoT. A complete case analysis that only includes 
observations without missing data on the prognostic factors as listed above was to be conducted as a 
sensitivity analysis to address the potential issue of missing data. A conservative ‘worst-case’ scenario 
might also be considered according to the analysis plan.  
Estimates of the causal treatment effect of interest, outcomes across groups were to be compared 
using weighting by odds approach to adjust for potential confounding. This method allowed for the use 
of all patients’ data from ReCORD and study E2202. The method maintains the composition of patients

in the study E2202 (assigning each patient a weight of 1), while patients in ReCORD were assigned 
weights by the odds of being in the trial cohort, 
, to reflect the trial population 
characteristics. To assess covariate balance, the distributions of baseline covariates pre- and post-
�
weighting was to be summarized, standardized mean differences (SMD) reported, and an SMD value of 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃� �1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃� �
<.25 for all the covariates listed was to be considered as balanced. If an imbalance was detected 
additional analyses, such as using trimming or weight truncation, was planned to be mitigate the 
impact of patients with extreme weights on the variability of the treatment effect estimates.  
All time-to-event endpoints was to be evaluated from the start of enrollment in E2202 study and from 
the start date of SOC in ReCORD which was expected to be an adequate approximation of the date of 
prescription. The distribution of each time-to-event endpoint was to be estimated using a weighted 
Kaplan-Meier estimator, and a weighted Cox proportional hazards regression used to estimate the 
hazard ratio. The median survival, proportion of patients without event and corresponding hazard 
ratios were to be calculated at certain timepoints (3, 6, 12 months), and the bootstrap 95% confidence 
intervals provided. 
PFS, defined as time to first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, was to be 
censored, at the date of the starting new anticancer therapy, if the patient did not have disease 
progression before the start of new anticancer therapy. A sensitivity analysis for PFS considering new 
anti-cancer therapy as a PFS event was to be performed. However, progression dates were not 
available for many patients in ReCORD, so the comparison analysis of PFS was performed by 
considering new anticancer therapy as an event for patients in both ReCORD and Study E2202.  
TTNT, defined as time to the start of a new anti-lymphoma treatment (including HSCT) or death due to 
any cause, was to be censored on the last contact date, if the patient did not experience the event.  
The weighted proportion of patients who achieved complete response and any response (partial 
response or complete response) before disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy, 
whichever comes first, was to be evaluated, differences in proportions summarized, and 95% 
confidence intervals was to be calculated using bootstrapping. Patients with unknown clinical response 
was to be treated as non-responders.  
A subgroup analysis of patients with a selected LoT with treatment initiation date in or after 2014 
(coinciding with the introduction of the Lugano criteria as well as the EMA approval of idelalisib) was to 
be performed.  
A comparison of baseline variables between ReCORD patients (at their selected LoT) and Study E2202 
patients before and after ReCORD patients are weighted by their odds of being in Study E2202 are 
shown in

Table 34. Standardized mean differences between the two cohorts were assessed for pre-weighted and 
post-weighted data. Success of the weighting process was evaluated based on the SMD; an absolute 
SMD of <25% for a particular variable was considered balanced [Study E2202 versus ReCORD RWE 
report-Section 6.3]. 
Imbalances between Study E2202 and the pre-weighted ReCORD dataset in selected LoT have been 
reduced by weighting. Since all of the important baseline prognostic variables achieved balance using 
the criterion of absolute SMDs < 25%, the weighting by odds analysis appears to be reasonable to 
adjust for imbalances of measured baseline variables between groups.

The key question of interest is the effect of prescribing tisagenlecleucel vs. SOC in patients who 
participated in Study E2202. As a consequence, weight of 1 is assigned to patients in Study E2202 and

the results of Study E2202 do not change after weighting. The changes in ReCORD study results after 
weighting reflect the adjustment of the population to address the question of interest. 
The median study follow-up time (defined as time to death or last follow-up date) was 15 months for 
Study E2202, and 22 months in the weighted sample for ReCORD (at the selected LoTs). The median 
survival and corresponding HRs for tisagenlecleucel from Study E2202 compared to standard 
treatments from ReCORD were calculated for OS, PFS and TTNT (time to start new therapy) based on 
all patients. The bootstrap 95% confidence intervals were provided. A clinically meaningful and 
consistent improvement for all endpoints was observed before and after weighting in Study E2202 vs. 
ReCORD (Table 35).

A subgroup analysis of patients with at least one eligible line of therapy beginning in or after 2014, to 
coincide with the introduction of the new Lugano response criteria as well as the EMA approval of 
idelalisib, was conducted. The results from this subset of patients treated in or after 2014 are generally 
consistent with results observed in the main analysis presented above. As a sensitivity analysis to 
address the potential issue of missing data in key prognostic factors, a conservative ‘worst-case’ 
scenario was conducted. The results suggest a strong benefit of tisagenlecleucel in increasing patients’ 
response rate and in reducing the risk of death, disease progression and taking additional new anti-
cancer therapy compared to standard treatments. 
Flatiron Health Research Database. 
This non-interventional study utilizing electronic health records was conducted to provide comparative, 
contextual evidence to the existing data on the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel from E2202 based on 
current standard of care. Patient-level data collected from the US Flatiron Health Research Database 
(Flatiron), which covers community cancer practices, was analyzed following a pre-specified analysis 
plan. The study design is shown in Figure 28. 
Figure 28: Study design of Flatiron Non-interventional study for comparison with study 
E2202 
Methodology: 
Of note, not all Study E2202 inclusion/exclusion criteria were adopted in Flatiron.  
Main inclusion criteria: 
1.  Two or more visits in the Flatiron Health network on or after 01-Jan-2011  
2.  Diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (International Classification of Diseases 9th revision [ICD 
9]: 200x, 202x or ICD 10th revision [ICD 10]: C82x, C83x, C84x, C85x, C86x, C88x, C96x), as 
captured in structured data. 
3.  Has a diagnosis of FL with an initial diagnosis date on or after Jan 2011 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 91/154 
 
 
 
 
4.  Has a tumor grade of I, II, or IIIA, or low grade not otherwise specified at time of initial FL 
diagnosis 
5.  Has evidence of medication exposure to at least three lines of systemic therapy for treatment of FL 
6.  Exposed to an anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab, obinutuzmab, or ofatumamab) after FL diagnosis 
7.  Exposed to an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide, carmustine, bendamustine, ifosfamide, 
carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan, dacarbazine, or procarbazine) 
after FL diagnosis. 
8.  Upon applying #6 and #7 above, all lines of therapy after line 2, and after the exposure to an anti-
CD20 and alkylating agent for each patient were selected. The start date of each line was 
considered as the index date. The regimen associated with this line was defined as index regimen. 
After applying the remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria below, each patient in the Real-world 
Cohort may have multiple index dates and index regimens. 
9.  Aged at least 18 years old at index date. 
10. ECOG performance status that was either 0 or 1 within 30 days prior to and including index date. 
For patients with multiple ECOG assessments within this period, the closest assessment to the 
index date was chosen. Patients with a missing or unknown ECOG status during this period were 
included in the study. Internal research by Flatiron has revealed that ECOG is more likely to be 
documented among patients with worse prognosis. As such, it was anticipated that exclusion of 
patients with missing ECOG status at baseline would result in a biased sample. 
11. Index date was on or prior to 31-Mar-2020. Assuming a DCO date of 30-Jun-2020, this criteria 
allowed for a potential minimum follow-up time of 3 months. 
12. Confirmation of index line of therapy via abstraction 
13. Predicted to be FL 3L+ according to the machine learning model. 
14. Index date was on or after 01-Jan-2014. 
Main exclusion criteria (assessed at or before study index date) 
1.  Evidence of histologic transformation prior to and including index date 
2.  Evidence of any of the following prior to index date 
•  Anti-CD19 therapy administration 
•  Gene therapy or adoptive T-cell therapy 
•  Allogeneic HSCT 
•  Document receipt of clinical study drug 
3.  Index regimen includes a clinical trial study drug, anti-CD19 therapy, or gene therapy. 
4.  Evidence of active CNS involvement by malignancy at initial diagnosis or 1L treatment 
initiation. 
• 
This criterion was applied as documented by Flatiron in their analytic guide. Because 
site of involvement was only available at initial diagnosis or 1L treatment initiation, we 
are unable to apply the criteria in the protocol and briefing book, which is excluding 
active CNS involvement by malignancy within 30 days prior to index date. 
5.  Documented tumor grade IIIB at time of initial diagnosis date 
6.  Evidence of a non-FL primary malignancy with a diagnosis date, treatment date, or first 
documentation date occurring on or prior to the index line start date. 
• 
This criterion was applied by Flatiron even though it was listed as one of the infeasible 
criteria in the briefing book. 
Statistical methods 
A model for the propensity score, the probability of enrolment into the E2202 study conditional on 
observed baseline covariates, was estimated using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach 
to fitting a logistic regression to the outcome data, employing a robust sandwich variance estimator to 
account for the correlation between repeated observations on the same patient. This was done since 
Assessment report

each patient may be eligible for inclusion at the start of more than one line of therapy and contribute 
multiple correlated observations. The fitted logistic regression was to be used to derive a point 
estimate of the propensity score for each patient in the Flatiron data at each eligible line of therapy. 
The potential confounders that were considered for inclusion in the propensity score model at each line 
of therapy were:  
•  Age at treatment initiation 
•  Race 
•  Gender 
•  History of autologous stem cell transplant 
•  Number of previous lines of systemic treatment 
•  Group stage at initial FL diagnosis 
•  Number of months between initial FL diagnosis and initiation of index treatment 
•  Sites of nodal involvement at initial diagnosis 
•  Double refractory to systemic therapies 
• 
Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) of initiation of first line of treatment 
For each patient the eligible LoT associated with the highest propensity score was to be selected, and 
the propensity score model recalculated based on this using a logististic regression adjusting for the 
above variables to balance the baseline covariates across the two cohorts. A propensity score was then 
to be estimated for each patient in the Real-World cohort, an estimate of their probability of being 
included in the E2202 study given their baseline covariates at the selected LoT.  
Estimates of the causal treatment effect of interest, outcomes across groups were to be compared 
using weighting by odds approach to adjust for potential confounding. This method allowed for the use 
of all patients’ data from the Real-World cohort and study E2202. The method maintains the 
composition of patients in the study E2202 (assigning each patient a weight of 1), while patients in the 
, to reflect 
Real-world cohort were assigned weights by the odds of being in the trial cohort, 
the trial population characteristics. To assess covariate balance, the distributions of baseline covariates

pre- and post-weighting was to be summarized, standardized mean differences (SMD) reported, and 
an SMD value of <.25 for all the covariates listed was to be considered as balanced. If an imbalance 
was detected additional analyses were carried out, specifically first exploring if inclusion of interaction, 
alternate functional forms, or categorization of variables would sufficiently reduce imbalance. 
Sensitivity analyses using trimming or weight truncation approaches may be implemented to mitigate 
the impact of patients with extreme weights on the variability of the treatment effect estimate.  
All time-to-event endpoints were to be evaluated from the start of enrollment in E2202 study and from 
the start date of SOC in Flatirion which was expected to be an adequate approximation of the date of 
prescription. The evaluation was to include all patients that satisfy inclusion/exclusion criteria. The 
distribution of each time-to-event endpoint was to be estimated using a weighted Kaplan-Meier 
estimator, and a weighted Cox proportionalhazards regression used to estimate the hazard ratio. The 
median survival, proportion of patients without event and corresponding hazard ratios were to be 
calculated at certain timepoints (3, 6, 12 mth), and the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals provided. 
The proportionality assumption was to be examined by Schoenfeld residuals and visual inspection of a 
plot of the log cumulative hazard curves by log of time.  
OS, defined as time to death due to any cause, with the death date being the event date. If a death 
had not been observed, then OS was censored at the patient’s last activity date.  
PFS, defined as time to first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, was to be 
censored, at the date of the starting new anticancer therapy, if the patient did not have disease 
progression before the start of new anticancer therapy.  
Assessment report

TTNT, defined as time to the start of a new line of therapy (including HSCT) or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurred earlier, was to be censored on the last contact date, if the patient did not 
experience the event.  
For CRR and Over All Response Rate All enrolled patients in the Trial Cohort were to be considered. As 
some patients in the Real-world Cohort may not have had any response evaluations during treatment, 
patients from this Cohort with at least one evaluation for response or a documented death during 
treatment were to be considered for the analysis. Weighting by odds was to be carried out to balance 
on baseline characteristics, and proportions and differences in proportions and 95% bootstrapping 
confidence intervals calculated. Patients in the Trial Cohort who discontinued (death or due to other 
reasons) Study E2202 prior to infusion tisagenlecleucel were to be considered as non-responders.  
Several sensitivity analyses were planned, including ones aimed at examining the impact of missing 
data. A presentation of patient characteristics by missingness of ECOG status in the Realworld cohort 
to examine if there were meaningful difference between patients with and without ECOG status was to 
be performed.  
A within-patient analysis comparing time to progression (TTP) on the last prior therapy to the PFS on 
experimental therapy was to be conducted for both the Trial Cohort and the Real-world Cohort. The 
experimental therapy refers to tisagenlecleucel for the Trial Cohort and the selected LoT for the Real-
world Cohort. 
A complete case analysis including only patients with complete data for the covariates considered for 
balancing was planned as a sensitivity analysis, and additionally a conservative ‘worst-case’ scenario 
was to be considered.  
For PFS, a sensitivity analysis considering new anti-cancer therapy as a PFS event was to be 
performed.  
Results: 
A comparison of baseline variables between Flatiron patients and Study E2202 patients before and 
after Flatiron patients are weighted by their odds of being in Study E2202 are shown in Table 19. 
Standardized mean differences between the two cohorts were assessed for preweighted and post-
weighted data. Success of the weighting process was evaluated based on the SMD; an absolute SMD 
value of <25% for a particular variable was considered balanced. 
History of autologous HSCT and sites of nodal involvement at initial diagnosis were removed from the 
propensity score model due to extreme imbalance (standardized mean difference: 0.98 and 0.70, 
respectively) before weighting in order to achieve better overall balance for all other remaining 
variables. This was considered acceptable as more patients with history of autologous HSCT and nodal 
sites are present in Study E2202, i.e., not adjusting for these variables can be considered as 
conservative. The large imbalances between Study E2202 and the pre-weighted Flatiron dataset were 
greatly reduced by weighting (

Table 36); excellent balance was achieved with regards to important prognostic factors between 
Flatiron and Study E2202. Since the majority of the SMDs are < 25%, the weighting by odds analysis 
appears to be reasonable to adjust for imbalances of measured baseline covariates between groups.

Note: the format presented are based on the format included in the weighting model. Number of nodal sites at

The key question of interest is the effect of prescribing tisagenlecleucel vs. SOC in patients who 
participated in Study E2202. As a consequence, weight of 1 is assigned to patients in Study E2202 and 
the results of Study E2202 do not change after weighting. The changes in Flatiron study results after 
weighting reflect the adjustment of the population to address the question of interest. The median 
study follow-up time for patients in Study E2202 was 15 months, and the median follow-up time for 
Flatiron (at the selected LoTs) was 14 months in the weighted sample. The median survival and 
corresponding HRs for tisagenlecleucel from Study E2202 compared to standard treatments from 
Flatiron were calculated for OS, PFS, and TTNT (time to start new therapy) based on all patients. The 
bootstrap 95% CIs were provided. An improvement for all endpoints was observed before and after 
weighting in Study E2202 vs. Flatiron (Table 37).

*10,000 bootstrap samples were randomly drawn to calculate the percentile-based 95% CI 
*All K-M and cox regression results are based on survival data within the first 24 months (patients with survival 
data beyond 24 months were censored at Month 24). 
[1] Only patients with at least one evaluation for response or a documented death during treatment were 
considered for this analysis. Because the model would upweigh/downweigh each individual patient differently 
depending on the propensity score, the final sample size may not necessarily be proportionate to the sample size 
before weighting. 
A number of limitations have been described by the MAH.  
•  Not all inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study E2202 were able to be replicated. 
•  Some prognostic factors captured in Study E2202 were either incomplete or not available in 
Flatiron. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
There may be inherent, unobservable differences between patients in the Flatiron receiving 
standard of care and patients choosing to enroll in Study E2202 who are seeking gene therapy. 
For example, one observed difference was a lower rate of autologous HSCT among patients in 
the real-world cohort. Other unobservable differences may include patient characteristics, such 
as higher socioeconomic status or better access to healthcare, among patients enrolled in 
Study E2202 compared to those in Flatiron. 
Flatiron did not explicitly abstract relapsed/refractory (r/r) status for the Real-world Cohort. 
This differs from the Study E2202 inclusion criteria, which required patient to be refractory to 
second line or later of systemic therapy, relapse within 6 months of completion of second line 
or later systemic therapy, relapse during anti-CD20 antibody maintenance (following at least 
two lines of therapies as above), or within 6 months after maintenance completion. 
The rwR and rwP variables were extracted from RWD collected in the EHR as part of routine 
clinical care, and information about response and progression event(s) were retrospectively 
abstracted from the available clinician documentation. rwR captures a clinician’s assessment of 
change in disease burden following radiographic imaging during a line of therapy, and rwP 
captures each distinct episode in which the treating clinician concludes that there has been 
growth or worsening of disease. This method of data collection, while clinically meaningful, 
differs from prospective collection of progression and response data within the context of a 
clinical trial. Analysis of response and progression-related endpoints when using RWD may 
involve by missing data, absence or lag in routine scanning, imprecise time estimates, and 
imprecise assessments of change in disease status; this may lead to biased, but conservative, 
time-to-event estimates if the assessments were less frequent. However, the scan frequency 
for rwR in the Flatiron study was comparable to that in Study E2202, so potential biases were 
likely mitigated. 
The presence of potential confounding and selection bias necessitated the performance of 
robust statistical analyses in the absence of a randomized controlled clinical trial. More 
specifically, analyses that adjust for differences in key prognostic and confounding factors were 
warranted. It should be acknowledged that despite best attempts, the potential for selection 
bias and unmeasured and residual confounding cannot fully be ruled out. 
Flatiron may contain the inherent limitations of non-interventional RWD. The quality of 
information extracted from RWD depends on the quality of information available in the data 
source. While the dataset has the potential for missing, inaccurate, or incomplete data, 
technology-enabled abstraction by specially-trained human abstractors using documented

policies and procedures and defined QA and QC activities aim to reduce data issues and 
increase completeness. 
Systematic literature review 
The objective of the systematic literature review was two-fold: 
• 
• 
To identify evidence on the clinical efficacy, safety, and patients reported outcomes (PRO) of 
third-line and later (3L+) treatments for FL in the adult (≥18 years) population 
To assess the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of r/r 3L+ FL patients  
Methodology: 
The key biomedical databases including Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online 
(MEDLINE®), Excerpta Medica Database (Embase®), MEDLINE® In-Process, and Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR] were 
searched from January 1998 to 08 April 2021. In addition to these databases, abstracts from five 
relevant conference proceedings were hand-searched for the past three years (2018 to 2021). 
Furthermore, bibliographic screening of previously published SLRs and meta-analysis was conducted to 
identify any data gaps. 
• 
The review was conducted according to a pre-defined study protocol including (i) randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), single-arm trials, and observational studies reporting efficacy, safety 
and PRO of 3L+ treatments for adults FL patients, who have received at least two prior 
therapies (ii) epidemiology studies reporting fraction of patients who needs a 3L+ treatment 
for FL. To be included for the SLR evidence, the study had to meet the following two key 
criteria: 
o  Reporting FL specific data (either FL alone or iNHL study including FL subgroup) 
 
 
For studies including multiple indolent NHL histology, a subgroup data of FL 
was reported 
For studies including multiple indolent NHL histology, ≥75% of FL patients 
contributing to the study population was considered acceptable for this SLR  
o  3L+ lines of therapy data 
•  Majority of patients (≥75%) must have at least 2 prior lines of therapy or prior two regimen 
treated including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent. 
•  A two-stage screening of the references that were retrieved was undertaken based on the 
abstracts and full-text publications. Screening of relevant studies was conducted by two 
independent reviewers and any discrepancies between reviewers were reconciled by a third 
independent reviewer. Data from trials were extracted by a single reviewer with quality check 
undertaken by an independent reviewer. Studies with multiple publications were linked 
together. 
Results: 
The SLR time-frame was determined based on approval for rituximab in the FL indication (1998-April 
2021). However, this extended time interval may introduce chronology bias due to modifications in 
diagnostic criteria/classifications (FLIPI introduction), clinical management, and response criteria 
assessment (Lugano) of FL. The 36 studies identified were further narrowed down to include evidence 
published from 2014 onwards resulting in the inclusion of 24 studies. Of the 24 studies, nine were 
clinical trials (single arm: 6, RCTs: 2, non-RCTs: 1) and 15 were retrospective observational studies. 
Overall, the interventions assessed across this evidence included CAR-T therapies (Tisa-cel; Axi-cel); 
Pi3K inhibitors (Idelalisib; Copanlisib; Duvelisib), lenalidomide + rituximab [R2], tazemetostat, mixed 
interventions for 3L+, auto-SCT, allo-SCT, and salvage therapy post auto-SCT relapse. The efficacy 
outcomes are shown in Table 38.

Studies with populations similar to E2202 (ELARA) trial  
Overall, six studies were identified as historical controls to tisagenlecleucel. These included the 
following approved treatments: PI3K inhibitors (n = 4) (Salles et al 2017, Flinn et al 2019, Dreyling et 
al 2017, Eyre et al 2017), salvage therapies for relapse post ASCT (n = 1) (Sesques et al 2020), and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel (n=1) (Jacobson et al 2020). 
In Sesques et al 2020, patients relapsing after ASCT received heterogenous treatments, including 
radiation therapy (n = 5, 6%), allogeneic HSCT (in consolidation after CR obtained by CT/ ICT) (n = 
11, 12%), rituximab single agent therapy (n = 13, 14%), targeted agents (n = 16, 18%), and 
rituximab chemotherapy combinations or chemotherapy alone (n = 45, 50%).  
Overall, response rates for PI3K inhibitors ranged from 43%-59% (Table 39) while an ORR >86% was 
observed with axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta® USPI) and tisagenlecleucel. A complete response 
between 1% - 20% was observed with PI3K inhibitors, a range between 51% and 53% was observed 
with salvage therapies for relapse after ASCT, while >60% was observed with axicabtagene ciloceulel 
(Yescarta® USPI) and tisagenlecleucel. 
Median DOR was 7.9 to 14.1 months for PI3K inhibitors. The median DOR was not reached for 
axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta® USPI) and tisagenlecleucel, with the median follow-up for DOR of 
14.5 (Yescarta® USPI) and 16.85 months, respectively. 
The PFS rates at 1 year was 43% for idelalisib, approximately 50% for salvage therapies post ASCT 
relapse (Sesques et al 2020) and >65% for axicabtagene ciloleucel (Jacobson et al 2020) and 
tisagenlecleucel. Median OS ranged from 28 to 38 months with PI3K inhibitors, while it was 66 months 
with salvage therapy after ASCT. Median overall survival was not reached with axicabtagene ciloleucel 
(Jacobson et al 2020) and tisagenlecleucel at respective follow-up.

Superiority: The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was performed by 
testing the null hypothesis of Complete Response Rate (CRR) being less than or 
equal to 15% at a 1-sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance, i.e. H0: p ≤ 
0.15 vs. Ha: p >0.15. This hypothesis is based on CRR obtained for Idelalisib in 
same population setting (Salles et al Haematologica 2017).

Supportive study 
One completed pilot phase 2a study CTL019A2101J (hereafter referred to as study A2101J) is reported 
in two articles (Schuster et al 2017, Chong et al 2021). The MAH does not have access to individual 
patient data. This study included participants with DLBCL (n=23) and participants with FL (n=15). In 
the FL patient group, all except one patient received tisagenlecleucel (n=14). This summary of the 
A2101J study is restricted to the FL population.  
Patients were eligible if they had CD19+ FL with measurable residual disease after primary and salvage 
therapies, had relapsed or residual disease after autologous HSCT, or were not eligible for autologous 
or allogeneic SCT. After steady state apheresis to collect peripheral blood leukocytes, the patients 
received LD chemotherapy based on each patient’s treatment history, blood counts, and organ function 
(data not shown). Tisagenlecleucel were infused 1 to 4 days after the completion of LD chemotherapy. 
Enrolled patients received tisagenlecleucel infusions at a dose range of 1.0 to 5.0x108 transduced anti-
CD19 CAR T-cells between 11-Mar-2014 and 02-Aug-2016. The data on the clinical outcomes from the 
study were up to date as of 07-May-2017 (Schuster et al. 2017).  
Analysis set 
A total of 38 patients were enrolled in the study, and 28 patients received treatment as specified in the 
protocol. Among the patients who received tisagenlecleucel, 14 patients (50%) had FL. Ten patients 
did not receive treatment as specified in the protocol owing to rapid disease progression with clinical 
deterioration of which only 1 had FL.  T-cell manufacturing was unsuccessful for 5 patients, all of whom 
Assessment report

had absolute lymphocyte counts of 300/m3 or fewer (3 had poor T-cell growth, and 2 did not undergo 
apheresis owing to the degree of lymphopenia). It is not clear whether these represented patients with 
DLBCL or FL.  
Demographics and Baseline characteristics 
Table 41 provides an overview of patient characteristics at baseline in the A2101J clinical study.  
Table 40: Characteristics of Patients at Baseline (A2101J study) 
The median number of days from apheresis to infusion was 39 (range: 27-145); 36% (10/28) of the 
patients received bridging therapy, which was administered after apheresis and before LD 
chemotherapy. 
Efficacy 
The primary objective of the study was to estimate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in NHL patients by 
measuring the ORR in evaluable patients at 3 months. 
At a follow-up of 3 months, 79% (11/14; 95% CI: 49, 95) of the FL patients who had received ≥ 2 
prior lines of chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy obtained an ORR to tisagenlecleucel infusion 
(Schuster et al 2017), where 50% (7/14) of the patients achieved a CRR and 29% (4/14) reported a

PR. Three of the patients who obtained a PR at 3 months had a CRR by 6 months, and the CRR was 
therefore 71% (10/14; 95% CI: 42, 92) for these patients after 6 months of follow-up. One patient 
continued to have a PR at 6 months and had progressed 1-year post-infusion. At a median follow-up of 
28.6 months, 89% of patients with FL who had a response (95% CI: 43, 98) had maintained the 
response and 70% (95% CI: 38, 88) were reported to be progression-free.  
Additionally, after a median follow-up of 60.7 months, the PFS rate at 5 years was 43% (95% CI: 18, 
66), and 60% (95% CI: 25, 83) of the responders had a sustained response at 5 years. The median 
DOR and median OS were not reached (Chong et al 2021). Of note, the plateau of the PFS KM curve, 
not seen for currently available 3rd line and beyond treatments, could be suggestive of curative 
potential. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Data to support extending the current approved therapeutic indications of Kymriah to r/r FL is based 
on one single arm phase 2 clinical study E2202 that enrolled a total of 98 participants. From a 
regulatory point of view, a RCT would have been preferred based on the availability of alternative 
therapies for parts of the included population (i.e., the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib, which is approved for 
double refractory patients). Instead, the results from the study are contextualised through real world 
evidence based on ReCORD and Flatiron databases and a systematic literature review. This presents 
certain limitations, as discussed below.  
The E2202 clinical study aimed to enroll three distinct patient groups based on the following inclusion 
critera. Patients could be either a) refractory to a second line or later line of systemic therapy 
(including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent) or relapsed within 6 months after 
completion of a second line or later line of systemic therapy or b) relapsed during anti-CD20 antibody 
maintenance (following at least two lines of therapies as above) or within 6 months after maintenance 
completion or c) relapsed after autologous HSCT. Refractoriness was defined as failure to respond to 
previous treatment (SD/PD as best response) or PD within 6 months of prior therapy completion. In 
the first assessment round, a subgroup analysis was requested to ensure consistent efficacy across the 
populations defined by the inclusion criteria. This analysis confirmed similar CRR and ORR across 
groups.  Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered acceptable.  
Study schedules and duration of follow up is considered appropriate.  
It was also noted in the SA (EMA/SA/0000047236) that the primary efficacy analysis specified in the 
study protocol was to be conducted in the infused (mITT) population, but that the enrolled (ITT) 
population should be considered the primary efficacy population for regulatory purposes, as the overall 
treatment includes leukapheresis, LD chemotherapy and tisagenlecleucel administration, and that 
failures in between need to be considered as such. However, considering that the difference between 
the mITT and the ITT populations is only one patient, analysis in the mITT population can be 
considered acceptable.  
Patients were allowed to receive antineoplastic bridging therapies based on the investigators choice to 
stabilize the disease while waiting for tisagenlecleucel infusion. Of the 97 patients infused, 44 patients 
(45.4%) received optional antineoplastic bridging therapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Theoretically, the type of bridging therapy each individual patient received prior to infusion may have 
had an impact on the efficacy outcome of this CAR-T cell therapy. A PET-CT scan was therefore 
routinely performed, with a few exceptions, after bridging therapy and prior to tisagenlecleucel

infusion, to ensure monitoring of the correlation between response to bridging therapy and clinical 
response to tisagenlecleucel. The observed response in terms of CRR in patients who received bridging 
therapy in the EAS was 65.9% (29/44; 95% CI: 50.1, 79.5), and was comparable to that in the overall 
study population. Similarly, CRR for those that did not receive bridging therapy in the EAS was 72% 
(36/50; 95% CI: 57.5, 83.8). These data which were obtained from the subgroup analysis did 
therefore not reveal any influence of bridging therapy on the efficacy outcomes in the studied patient 
population. 
The primary objective of study E2202 was CRR. A single arm phase 2 study based on CRR can be 
accepted in the target population with r/r tumours where limited therapies exist. While ORR is a more 
commonly used endpoint, CRR has been observed to correlate better than PR rate with prolonged 
response in the case of CAR-T cell therapies. The use of CRR as a primary endpoint in this trial is 
therefore considered acceptable. However, as also noted in the Scientific Advice 
(EMA/SA/0000047236), the CRR would need to be assessed in conjunction with DOR, and these data 
would need to be sufficiently mature to establish a benefit also in terms of response durability. For 
comparison, idelalisib demonstrated a median DOR of 11.8 months in an older and more refractory 
patient population (Zydelig EPAR). The secondary and exploratory objectives proposed are considered 
appropriate considering the objectives and overall aim of the study.  
In the Enrolled set (n=98), protocol deviations were reported in 58 patients (59.2%). These findings 
were similar in the EAS which incorporated 55 (58.5%) patients with protocol deviations of which 10 
(10.6%) were inclusion deviations and 1 (1.1%) exclusion deviations. These patients nevertheless 
were part of the EAS and contributed to the endpoint data whilst, in principle, these patients should 
have been excluded from the study. In addition, these deviations add to the heterogeneity of the 
patient population. The MAH states that the deviations were not considered to affect the overall 
conclusions of the study and subsequently provided data on the EAS where these 11 patients were 
excluded from the analysis. In this modified EAS (n=83), CRR is 71.1% and ORR 86.7%, confirming a 
comparable efficacy with the EAS (n=94: CRR 69.1%, ORR 86.2%) and the enrolled set (n=98) with 
CRR 68.4% and ORR 85.7% 
Publications from one supportive study were provided. This pilot phase 2a study A2101J included 
participants with DLBCL (n=23) and participants with FL (n=15). In the FL group, all except one 
patient received tisagenlecleucel (n=14). The study populations were similar in that the A2101J study 
enrolled adults with CD19+ FL having experienced at least 2 prior chemotherapy or immune-
chemotherapy regimens (not including single agent monoclonal antibody therapy), who had a limited 
prognosis (several months to <2 year expected survival) with currently available therapies. The 
therapies were current as of 2014 in agreement with RWE used to contextualise the results. It is not 
possible to compare the study populations further, but both appear to have had advanced disease. The 
dose of tisagenlecleucel was slightly different in the A2101J study than in the E2202 study (1 – 5 x108 
CART-19 cells vs 0.6 – 6 x108 CART-19 cells).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study population 
As noted above, the study population, as defined by the inclusion criteria, could potentially be quite 
heterogeneous. The MAH was therefore requested to further assess the efficacy in the subgroups 
defined by the originally proposed indication wording. This analysis confirmed similar CRR and ORR 
across these subgroups of patients. The enrolled patient population in study E2202 represented FL 
patients with advanced disease with a median of four lines of prior therapy (range: 2 to 13) and 28.6% 
of patients received ≥ 5 lines of prior antineoplastic therapies. Of the enrolled patients, 77.6% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 108/154 
 
 
 
patients were refractory to their last line of therapy. Of these, 54 patients (55.1%) showed SD/PD as 
their best response to their most recent regimen and 22 patients (22.4%) had disease relapse within 6 
months from completion of this last regimen. Thirty-six patients received prior HSCT, of whom 15 
patients relapsed within 12 months from transplant. Moreover, a high percentage of patients had bulky 
disease, high to intermediate FLIPI, POD24, or were double refractory.  
The timing of HSCT in disease and treatment course is not specified in either the inclusion criteria or 
the indication. The number of enrolled participants that had experienced HSCT was small (n=36) of 
which 15 relapsed within 12 months and the remainder thereafter. It is not known when in disease 
course the HSCT had taken place. The majority of patients were refractory to the last line of therapy 
(n=74/94, 78.7%) compared to relapsed (n=17/94, 18.0%).  All patients had received prior anti-CD20 
therapy. Among patients in the EAS relapsing >6 months after the last line of treatment, 5 patients 
relapsed during (n=4) or within (n=1) 6 months from the end of anti CD20 maintenance, while 15 
patients relapsed after HSCT. 
Indication wording: 
 The originally proposed wording of the sought indication was: “Adult patients with follicular lymphoma 
(FL) after two or more lines of therapy who are refractory or relapsed during or within 6 months after 
completion of anti-CD20 antibody maintenance or relapsed after autologous haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT)”. A revised and simplified wording of the indication, reflective of the enrolled 
patients in study E2202 with r/r FL who had received at least two lines of prior systemic therapy, and 
giving consideration to patients with earlier relapse, or with relapse after HSCT, reflective of a more 
aggressive form of FL, for which the benefit/risk of tisagenlecleucel could be assessed, was requested 
in the first assessment round. The MAH was further asked to discuss whether the B/R observed in the 
studied patient population might be extrapolated to other subgroups of FL, in particular patients with 
low-risk disease, that have not been included or are not well represented in the pivotal study.  
The agreed indication is “Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two 
or more lines of systemic treatment”. It is acknowledged that a simplified wording of the indication 
would also encompass patients with FL Grade 3b for which no data is available since they were 
excluded from the clinical study. In clinical practice, these patients are often treated as DLBCL, for 
which tisagenlecleucel is also indicated. The extrapolation of the positive B/R balance of Kymriah 
observed in the studied FL and DLBCL populations to patients with FL grade 3b, as well as grade 3a, 
can therefore be considered acceptable. 
Primary endpoint 
As noted in scientific advice (EMA/SA/0000047236), the CR rate would need to be assessed in 
conjunction with DOR, and these data should be sufficiently mature to establish a benefit also in terms 
of response durability. Whilst the primary outcome, CRR, was met, the secondary outcome of DOR per 
IRC was not reached at the time of the data cut-off (29-Mar-2021). The MAH had been advised to 
potentially revise the timing of the analysis to demonstrate, with high precision, a potential difference 
in median DOR compared to the external data sets (RWD) included to contextualise the results. The 
MAH subsequently provided data from a planned DCO of 03-Aug-2021, corresponding to additional 4 
months of median follow-up (median follow up: 21 months in the EAS, range: 14-30). No new 
responders and no new conversions from PR to CR were observed with longer followup. Median DOR 
was not reached at this DCO either, with 9-month DOR unchanged, and 12-month DOR similar to the 
main analysis (DCO: 29-Mar-2021), supporting a sustained response.  
Statistical analysis

The statistical hypothesis compares the CRR rate in E2202 against that in the idelalisib pivotal study.  
It was noted in the scientific advice (EMA/SA/0000047236), that the pivotal study for idelalisib 
included older (median age 64 vs 56.5 years) and more refractory patients (89.6% vs 78.4% 
refractory to last treatment line) than study E2202. Thus, the validity of the applied reference CR rate 
is uncertain. Nonetheless, as was noted in the SA, this issue is likely overcome by compelling actual 
study results, with a CRR per IRC assessment in the EAS of 69.1% (95% CI: 58.8, 78.3) at the current 
data cut-off date (29-Mar-2021). 
Secondary endpoints 
At the time of the main analysis (DCO 29-Mar-2021), the median DOR per IRC was not reached. 
Responses (CR or PR) per IRC review were achieved in 81 patients, with the estimated probability of 
remaining in response for 9 months being 76.0% (95% CI: 64.6, 84.2) and for 12 months being 
71.6% (95% CI: 58.9, 80.9) Out of the 81 responders, 59 patients were censored. An updated 
analysis (DCO: 03-Aug-2021), corresponding to additional 4 months of median follow-up (median 
follow up: 21 months in the EAS, range: 14-30) also did not reach median DOR. 9-month remained 
DOR unchanged, and 12-month DOR was similar to the main analysis (DCO: 29-Mar-2021).   
At the time of the DCO of 29-March 2021, the median PFS per IRC was 18.4 months (95% CI: 12.3, 
NE); however, this should be interpreted with caution since there were limited numbers of patients 
remaining at risk after Month 18. At a later DCO (03-Aug-2021), with median follow up of 21 months 
(range: 14-30) in the EAS, 12-month PFS remained unchanged, while median PFS increased from 18.4 
months to 29.5 months, with the caveat of a low number of patients at risk after month 25. 
The median OS was not reached at the time of the data DCO. Seven deaths had occurred in the study 
(Table 4). (See section on Safety). In the EAS, the estimated probability of survival was 95.3% (95% 
CI: 88.0, 98.2) at Month 12 and 91.6% (95% CI: 81.7, 96.2) at Month 18. At the DCO of 03-Aug-
2021, 12-month OS remained essentially unchanged. 
Patient reported outcomes 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) were also assessed as part of the study using three validated 
questionnaires. All patients in the tisagenlecleucel-infused population should have completed the 
questionnaires, however, the number of respondents was low at baseline, ranging from 65 to 76 
patients, and declined over time providing a strong potential for selection bias. Patients continued to 
respond to the questionnaire for two visits after disease progression which explains some of the fall in 
respondents, but other reasons for failing to respond to the questionnaire are not provided. There is 
also no control group in the study for comparison. It was noted that anxiety/depression and effects on 
usual activities are noted to be greater than baseline at 6 months post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. This is 
a similar time point where greater deterioration was noted for the mental health component of the 
SF36 questionnaire. A total of 17 participants (17.1%) received further treatments and 2 (2.1%) 
participants received allogenic stem cell therapy post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. It is difficult to assess 
the effect on QoL in the latter group since no data was collected for the two patients that received 
HSCT. Furthermore, data is completely lacking for one of the 17 that received further treatment and 
has insufficient follow-up data for 6-7 of the remaining patients (depending on questionnaire). In 
general, the number of respondents declined over time. Reasons provided by the MAH include device 
issues, patient willingness or covid-19 pandemic related issues. The QoL data corresponding to the first 
three months following infusion was collected pre-pandemic. The non-technical reasons provided could 
nevertheless contribute to selection bias.

Real World Data (ReCORD and Flatiron) 
The real-world analyses were based on two non-interventional studies. Clinically meaningful 
differences in CRR and ORR after weighting were observed for Study E2202 vs ReCORD with 31.8% 
(95% CI: 18.1, 45.3) and 22% (95% CI:9.4, 34.5), respectively, and for Study E2202 vs Flatiron 
51.4% (95% CI: 21.2, 68.8) and 27.4% (95% CI: 3.0, 65.0), respectively. The median OS was not 
reached for Study E2202, ReCORD or Flatiron. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the OS rate at 12 months 
was 96.6% [95% CI: 92.9%, 100%] in Study E2202, 71.7% [95% CI: 61.2%, 82.2%] in ReCORD 
(HR=0.2 [95% CI:0.02, 0.38]), and 84.5% [95% CI: 64.9%, 95.9%] in Flatiron (HR=0.41 [95% CI: 
0.11, 1.47]). The median PFS considering start of a new therapy as an event was not reached for 
Study E2202 and was reached at 13.1 months for ReCORD. The estimated probability of being 
progression-free at 12 months was 70.5% [95% CI: 61.4%, 79.7%] in Study E2202 and 51.9% [95% 
CI: 40.6%, 63.3%] in ReCORD (HR=0.60 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.86]). The median PFS was not reached for 
Study E2202 and was reached at 9.9 months for Flatiron after weighting. The estimated probability of 
being progression-free at 12 months was 73.2% [95% CI: 64.1%, 82.1%] in Study E2202 and 41.8% 
[95% CI: 20.0%, 67.2%] in Flatiron (HR=0.45 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.88]).  
The above adjusted analyses were supported by unadjusted analyses showing similar results. Analyses 
restricted to the time point from 2014 and 2020 have also been provided, based on scientific advice, 
such that the treatment options would be similar to those for the E2202 study, and show similar 
results. Nevertheless, interpretation of the RWD is complicated by the fact that it was not possible to 
fully emulate the inclusion criteria in the E2202 study. As such the patient populations were similar but 
not identical. Important prognostic values were lacking and could not be adjusted for in the analyses. 
Also, response assessments were lacking in the RWD, necessitating changes to the endpoint definition 
(ReCORD), or further exclusion of patient that otherwise would qualify (Flatiron). This provides some 
uncertainty when used to contextualise the pivotal phase 2 clinical study E2202. These studies are 
despite the remaining uncertainty of the effect estimates nevertheless providing valuable context, and 
are in general deemed supportive of the pivotal study, due to the clear differences in outcomes they 
show.  
Supportive studies 
One pilot phase 2a study, A2101J, enrolling 15 patients with FL, of which 14 received tisagenlecleucel, 
was provided in support of the E2202 study. The data is based on articles in the literature. Although 
the sample size was small, the patient population was similar, where all had received at least 2 
systemic lines of prior therapy, and the patients had advanced disease. A total of 11/14 patients 
responded to tisagenlecleucel infusion at Month 3 follow-up (Schuster et al 2017). The CRR was 71%, 
with an ORR of 79%, which can support the findings in the E2202 study. At a median follow-up of 28.6 
months, 89% of patients with FL who had a response (95% CI, 43 to 98) had maintained the 
response.  
Additionally, after a median follow-up of 60.7 months, the PFS rate at 5 years was 43% (95% CI: 18 
to 66), and 60% (95% CI: 25, 83) of the responders had a sustained response at 5 years. The median 
DOR and median OS were not reached (Chong et al 2021) suggesting that the response was durable. 
This supportive study can only provide an indication on CRR and DOR in the longer term, due to the 
small sample size, but supports the potential for a durable response to tisagenlecleucel treatment in 
patients with advanced FL after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the efficacy data presented by the MAH suggests that clinically relevant responses can 
be obtained with Kymriah treatment in relapsed or refractory FL patients after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The RMP, summary of important safety concerns for Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel): 
In B-cell ALL indication, the most common non-haematological adverse reactions are cytokine release 
syndrome (77%), infections (73%), hypogammaglobulinaemia (53%), pyrexia (42%) and decreased 
appetite (38%). The most common haematological laboratory abnormalities were decreased white 
blood cells (100%), decreased haemoglobin (100%), decreased neutrophils (100%), decreased 
lymphocytes (100%) and decreased platelets (97%). 
In DLBCL indication, the most common non-haematological adverse reactions were cytokine release 
syndrome (57%), infections (58%), pyrexia (35%), diarrhoea (31%), nausea (29%), fatigue (27%) 
and hypotension (25%). The most common haematological laboratory abnormalities were decreased 
lymphocytes (100%), decreased white blood cells (99%), decreased haemoglobin (99%), decreased

New safety data are provided for the indication r/r FL (relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma) 
based on data from the pivotal phase 2 Study E2202, including 97 patients treated with 
tisagenlecleucel infusion with a median duration of follow-up post-infusion of 16.59 months (range: 
10.3 to 25.7 months). The enrollment of this study is complete, although the study is ongoing. In the 
pivotal study E2202 patients are followed on-study for at least 2 years post-infusion for safety. After 
the end of the study, patients will continue to be followed for long-term safety, under the long-term 
follow-up protocol (Study CCTL019A2205B). This study aims for 15 years safety follow-up.  
Supportive data is provided from a pilot study (study A2101J) providing safety data on 38 patients 
diagnosed with DLBCL (n = 24) or FL (n = 14) treated with tisagenlecleucel infusion, and which 
followed patients for a median of 60.7 months (5.1 years). The results from the study are published by 
Schuster et al 2017 Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells in refractory B-cell lymphomas. N Engl J Med; 
377(26):2545-5) for the 2 year follow-up and by Chong et al 2021 Lymphoma Program Investigators 
at the University of Pennsylvania. Five-year outcomes for refractory B-cell lymphomas with CART-cell

Patient exposure 
The targeted dose range was 0.6 to 6 × 108 CAR-positive viable T-cells in a single administration. 
All 97 patients received a single dose of tisagenlecleucel. The median number of CAR-positive viable T-
cells administered was 2.06 × 108 cells (range: 0.1 to 6.0 × 108). The median total viable cell count 
was 12 × 108 cells (range: 0.4 to 34.0 × 108). All patients, except 4, received tisagenlecleucel within 
the targeted dose range. 
Median age 57.0 years (range:29-73), 66% male, 75.3% were White, 13.4% were Asian. 
Concomitant therapy 
At the time of the current data cut-off, all patients in the Infused set (97 patients) with one exception 
received non-study concomitant medications. The most commonly used concomitant medications (in 
>30% of patients) by ATC class are listed below, presented in decreasing order of frequency:

•  Anti-infectives for systemic use in 93.8% of patients [primarily sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 
(42.3%)] 
•  Alimentary tract and metabolism medications in 79.4% of patients [primarily ondansetron 
(32.0%)] 
•  Nervous system medications in 71.1% [primarily paracetamol (53.6%) 
•  Blood and blood-forming organs medications in 58.8% [primarily enoxaparin (22.7%) 
•  Dermatologicals in 50.5% [primarily acyclovir (27.8%)

•  Antineoplastic and immuno-modulating agents in 47.4% [primarily filgrastim (25.8%) 
•  Cardiovascular system medications in 37.1% of patients 
Seventeen patients (17.5%) in the Infused Set received at least one anti-cytokine medication for CRS. 
All 17 patients received tocilizumab and 4 of them also received corticosteroids.  
Bridging therapy 
Of the 97 patients infused, 44 patients (45.4%) received optional antineoplastic bridging therapy prior 
to tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most commonly used agents (in ≥ 5% of patients) were rituximab 
(21.6%), dexamethasone (11.3%), gemcitabine (10.3%), oxaliplatin (7.2%), prednisolone (7.2%), 
etoposide (6.2%), cyclophosphamide (5.2%) and vincristine (5.2%). Furthermore, 2 patients received 
radiotherapy alone. 
Lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy 
All infused patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. Ninety-
two of them received fludarabine + cyclophosphamide and 5 received bendamustine

In addition to the cumulative safety data from Study E2202, safety data were derived from 3 epochs 
post-tisagenlecleucel infusion: the initial 8-week period, the periods between 8 weeks and 1 year, and 
subsequently after 1 year. 
The impact of changes implemented due to COVID-19 pandemic on the safety results was considered 
low because mitigation measures like performing safety assessments remotely (by phone, 
telemedicine) were taken. In one patient, tisagenlecleucel infusion was delayed (>8 weeks from 
enrollment) due to site issues. 
Adverse events prior to lymphodepletion phase 
Seventy-five patients (76.5%) experienced a broad range of AEs of all grades prior to treatment with 
LD chemotherapy or tisagenlecleucel infusion. AEs were consistent with those expected in patients

anemia, nausea, constipation, headache and low platelet count. These events were manageable per 
the relevant product information. Of note, 44/97 (45%) patients received bridging therapy prior to 
infusion. 
AEs during LD chemotherapy 
A total of 92 patients received fludarabine+cyclophosphamide and the 5 other patients received 
bendamustine as lymphodepleting regimen. Of the 97 patients who received LD chemotherapy, 5 
patients (77.3%) had at least 1 AE during the LD period (i.e. following LD chemotherapy and before 
administration of tisagenlecleucel). Thirty-six patients (37.1%) had AEs of grade 3/4 severity [Study 
E2202-Table 14.3.1-1.10]. All grade 4 AEs were cytopenia. There was no difference in the safety 
profile between the two LD regimens. The most commonly reported AEs (≥ 10%) irrespective of 
relationship to LD chemotherapy were nausea (35.1%), anemia (12.4%) and headache (10.3%). The 
AEs reported during the LD chemotherapy were consistent with those anticipated due to current and 
prior antineoplastic treatments and due to the underlying r/r FL. 
Adverse events post-tisagenlecleucel infusion 
Of the 97 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel, 96 patients (99.0%) experienced at least 1 post-
infusion AE, irrespective of relationship to treatment. 
The SOC with most commonly reported grade ≥3 AEs in ≥15% of the patients was blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (59.8%) investigations (29.9%) and infections and infestations (15.5%). AEs within 
the‘immune system disorders’ SOC were also very commonly reported (55.7%) as this SOC includes 
CRS, which is an expected AE with tisagenlecleucel.

(16.5%), febrile neutropenia (12.4%) and thrombocytopenia (11.3%). Of note, all CRS events were 
grade 1-2, apart from one fatality more than one year after infusion, attributed to a late onset of CRS 
by the Investigator and described in below.

As observed in other NHL indications, the majority of the AEs occurred within the initial 8- week period 
post -tisagenlecleucel infusion (96.9%). The incidence of AEs decreased after this time period: 83.3% 
at > 8 weeks to 1 year post-infusion and 26.8% (19/71 patients) > 1 year post-infusion. 
The most common AEs reported in ≥ 10% of patients between >8 weeks to 1 year post-infusion were 
neutropenia (19.8%), WBC count decreased (12.5%), and diarrhea (10.4%).  
The most common AEs reported in ≥ 2% of patients >1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were 
neutropenia (4.2%), pneumonia (4.2%), arthralgia (2.8%), COVID-19 (2.8%), thrombocytopenia 
(2.8%) and WBC count decreased (2.8%). 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in a total of 76 patients (78.4%).

patients (n = 7). 
CRS grade 1 or 2 was reported in 48 patients (49.5%). In 47 patients, CRS was reported within 8 
weeks post-infusion and was suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. In 1 patient, CRS occurred 
more than 200 days after infusion and was not suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel, but to other 
antineoplastic treatment given for disease progression after infusion. Moreover, there was 1 fatal event 
attributed to a late onset of CRS more than twelve months after infusion that was suspected by the 
investigator to be related to tisagenlecleucel, see below. 
Tisagenlecleucel-related AEs 
The majority of the patients (78.4%) had AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel that occurred 
anytime post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. The majority of these AEs were reported within the initial 8 
weeks post-infusion. The most commonly reported AEs of any grade with a potential causal 
relationship to tisagenlecleucel are shown in Table 45.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Seven patients died during the course of the study, with all deaths occurring >30 days post 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. Of these 7 deaths, 5 occurred due to progression of the underlying disease.

One patient died 1 year after tisagenlecleucel infusion due to a second episode of CRS as per 
Investigator assessment, and one patient died following euthanasia chosen for worsening progressive 
neurological symptoms due to possible PML. 
A  72-year-old male patient had one episode of CRS on Day 7, which resolved on Day 30. The patient 
received tisagenlecleucel at a dose of 1.1 × 108 CAR positive viable T-cells. On Day 345 in the setting 
of ongoing pancytopenia and pneumonia, the patient had hypotension (60 mm Hg) that was attributed 
to sepsis or hypercytokinemia, with concurrent grade 3 encephalopathy. By means of exclusion, the 
Investigator diagnosed CRS. The treatment included vasopressin initially for progressive hypotension, 
tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, 2 doses) and high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g). On Day 375, 
adalimumab (1 dose) and antithymocyte immunoglobulin (1 dose) were administered. The patient died 
on the same day due to multiorgan failure despite four lines of treatment for CRS. In the absence of a 
definitive diagnosis of sepsis or autoimmune disorder, the Investigator attributed the death to CRS. 
The Investigator suspected a causal relationship between tisagenlecleucel and the death. Novartis 
comment: Transgene levels at Month 3 were 96 copies/μg, and at Month 6 and Month 9 (6 and 3 
months before the death, respectively) were below the limit of sensitivity, which makes a new onset of 
CRS at Month 12 due to tisagenlecleucel unlikely. Since a blood sample for transgene and cytokine 
analysis were not collected at Month 12 and in the absence of supporting investigations at the time of 
the event, the causality of fatal CRS was conservatively considered not assessable with 
tisagenlecleucel. In addition, pancytopenia and pneumonia further confounded the assessment. 
Autopsy results were not available at the time of the study report. 
A 57-year-old female patient received tisagenlecleucel at a dose of 1.8×108 CAR-positive viable T-cells. 
The patient achieved CR at Month 3 assessment. The patient experienced grade 1 CRS on Day 4 that 
resolved. On Day 11, the patient developed encephalopathy. On Day 12, the patient was diagnosed 
with encephalitis due to HHV6 (Human Herpes Virus 6) and was treated with ganciclovir for 3 weeks 
and also corticosteroids, after which the event resolved. Because the HHV6 DNA levels in CSF were at 
the limit of sensitivity, it was not fully diagnostic for HHV6 encephalitis, and the Principal Investigator 
considered that the neurological symptoms could have also been related to tisagenlecleucel and 
recorded 2 distinct events (encephalopathy grade 4 (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome) related to tisagenlecleucel, and HHV6 related encephalitis). Approximately 8 months after 
the infusion, the patient developed non-fluent aphasia and mild left paresis. The MRI showed multifocal 
white matter abnormalities and the CSF was negative for JC virus, although JC virus was isolated in 
the blood. Based on these findings, the Investigator provided a diagnosis of “possible” progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (radiological and clinical findings in keeping with PML, but viral 
screening on CSF negative, so a definitive diagnosis of PML was not possible). One month later, the 
patient presented with worsening of neurologic symptoms (grade 3), as well as new symptoms 
including ptosis and right hemiparesis. The patient chose euthanasia due to progressive neurological 
symptoms and died on Day 302. Last transgene levels performed on Day 250 (11-Jan-2021) were 
139.6 copies/μg [Study E2202- CSR Section 12.2.1]. The patient was in ongoing CR at Month 6. The 
last planned efficacy assessment (Month 9) was not performed due to deterioration of the neurological 
symptoms. The patient did not receive any further anticancer treatment post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Novartis comment: The causality between PML and tisagenlecleucel was considered not assessable. 
Prolonged immunosuppression due to multiple treatments for FL might have contributed to PML. Lack 
of autopsy results preclude a meaningful case assessment.

Other serious adverse events 
Post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, forty-two patients (43.3%) experienced at least 1 SAE, 29 of whom 
(29.9%) had at least 1 SAE suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. Serious AEs were reported 
more frequently within the initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion than in the period from >8 
weeks to 1 year and >1 year post-infusion (27.8% vs. 19.8% and 7.0%). From >8 weeks to 1 year 
post-infusion, 8 patients had SAEs which were considered to be related to tisagenlecleucel and from 
>1year post-infusion, 2 patients had SAEs that were considered to be related to tisagenlecleucel. 
Serious AEs such as CRS (19.6%) and febrile neutropenia (6.2%) were expected tisagenlecleucel-
related events and were managed by standard supportive care and concomitant medications. Two 
individual SAEs were noteworthy. They include a case of encephalopathy followed by possible PML and 
a fatal case of CRS (see above).

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
Forty-seven patients (48.5%) had CRS. With the exception of one fatal grade 5 CRS case, all of these 
patients had either grade 1 (n = 26) or grade 2 (n = 20) CRS. There were no patients with grade 3/4 
CRS. The CRS events had resolved at the time of the data cut-off.  
The median time to onset of CRS was 4.0 days (range: 1 to 14 days) and the median duration of CRS 
events was 4 days (range: 1 to 24 days), excluding the two late events that occurred on Day 207 and 
Day 368, respectively post-infusion:  
One of these cases did not have CRS within 8 weeks after infusion. Following documented disease 
progression (Day 85) the patient received a new antineoplastic investigational treatment (T-cell 
engaging bispecific antibody) since Day 120. Subsequently, the patient developed 3 consecutive 
episodes of grade 1 CRS from Day 207 to Day 222 while he was on the investigational treatment. The 
Investigator suspected a causality for CRS related to the investigational antineoplastic drug but not to 
tisagenlecleucel. The patient subsequently received radiotherapy, rituximab, and lenalidomide. Last 
detectable transgene levels were recorded at Month 6 (25.69 μg/copies of DNA). Transgene levels 
were subsequently not quantifiable at Month 9 and Month 12. The patient was continuing in the study 
for survival follow up at the time of this report. 
The other patient had a first episode of CRS grade 1 after infusion that did not require anti-cytokine 
treatment. Almost 1 year after infusion, the patient developed encephalopathy, fever, persistent 
hypotension and hypoxia in the context of pancytopenia and pneumonia. Despite 4 lines of treatment 
for CRS, this event led to death. (for more information see above)

Concurrent infections were observed in 7 patients (14.9%). These infections were esophageal 
candidiasis, urinary tract infection, HHV6 infection, Pseudomonas sepsis, bacteremia (Staphylococcus 
aureus), Escherichia sepsis and rhinovirus infection. Fever was reported in 43 patients and in the 
remaining 5 patients without concurrent fever, 2 patients had febrile neutropenia/neutropenic fever. 
Organs that were affected with CRS toxicity included the heart (grade 2 cardiac toxicity), the kidney 
(grade 1 blood creatinine increased) and the skin (grade 2 maculopapular rash). Each toxicity was 
reported in 1 patient each. All these toxicities had resolved at the time of the data cut-off date 
Table 48 Description of CRS first episodes (Safety set, in patients with CRS)  
Systemic anti-cytokine treatment with tocilizumab or corticosteroids was required in 17 patients 
(17.5%) in the Infused set, which included 16 of the 47 patients (34.0%) who had CRS in the first 8 
weeks from infusion. Thirteen of those patients required only 1 (n=8) or 2 (n=5) doses of tocilizumab, 
and 4 patients required both tocilizumab and corticosteroids [i.e. dexamethasone (n=1) and 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate (n=3)]. None of the patients received high dose steroids apart 
from the fatal case (described in subsection “Deaths” in section 4.6.4. As per the protocol CRS 
management algorithm, tocilizumab 8 mg/kg could be administered every 8 hours starting from grade 
2 CRS (for a maximum of 3 doses within 24 h). 
According to the Clinical Study Report v1.0, all CRS events, with the exception of one fatal CRS AE, 
were of grade 1/2 severity, indicating adequate management of these events through the CRS 
management algorithm. The absence of grade 3/4 CRS within initial 8 weeks in this trial differs from 
previous experience in DLBCL in the JULIET study and could be explained partially by the less 
aggressive nature of FL, but also by the use of a modified treatment algorithm which includes earlier 
use of anti-cytokine therapy like tocilizumab in the presence of symptoms requiring mild intervention. 
Data suggest this may decrease the incidence of high grade CRS and potential complications from CRS, 
resulting in improved outcomes for the patients.

Serious neurological adverse reactions (SNARs) 
Thirteen episodes of SNAR (including both non-serious AEs and SAEs) were reported in 11 patients 
(11.3%) post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. Nine patients experienced SNARs within 8 weeks post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion. Preferred terms reported were Effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome (4 cases), Encephalopathy (3 cases), Tremor (2 cases), Delirium, Dyskinesia, Dysphagia and 
Muscular weakness (one case each). 
Grade 3/4 AEs (delirium and serious immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS) were 
reported in 3 patients: 
• 
In a 56 year old female patient, the SAE of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome (ICANS) grade 4 (encephalopathy) was reported on Day 11 and was suspected to be 
related to tisagenlecleucel. The ICANS was improved to grade 1 on Day 14 and the event 
resolved on Day 16. Concomitant HHV6 encephalitis was reported as a concomitant SAE for 
this patient. The patient received high-dose steroids (for ICANS treatment) and ganciclovir (for 
Assessment report

HHV6 encephalitis) with complete resolution of the events. The patient subsequently developed 
an SAE of possible PML and died for euthanasia related to worsening neurological symptoms. 
For a more detailed information, see description on fatal cases under “Deaths” in section 4.6.4 
• 
In a 42 year old male, grade 3 delirium was reported on Day 190. At the time of the event, the 
patient’s disease had progressed and treatment had started with a new systemic antineoplastic 
therapy. This event was not suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. It resolved on the 
same day without treatment. 
•  Another patient developed grade 3 encephalopathy (SAE) on Day 345, followed by CRS (SAE), 
approximately 1 year after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The patient died on Day 375 due to CRS 
per Investigator assessment with concomitant organ toxicities of acute kidney injury and 
capillary leak syndrome. For more detailed information, see description on fatal cases  under 
“Deaths” in section 4.6.4 
The MAH states in the Clinical overview addendum that Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome (ICANS) is introduced as a newly selected stand-alone ADR (by PT) in SmPC section 4.8 
based on safety experience in Study CCTL019E2202. The PT ICANS was first introduced as a medical 
term in literature end of 2019 (Lee et al 2019) and subsequently included as PT with the release of 
MedDRA version 23.1 on 19-Apr-2020. Since the currently effective ADR Table 2 is based on statistical 
outputs generated in 2018, ICANS is not presented as ADR by nature. Since ICANS is based on a 
complex definition, appropriate re-mapping of previously reported ADRs reflective of CAR T-cell 
therapy associated neurotoxicity to ICANS is considered not feasible. 
SNARs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel were reported in 8 patients (8.2%). The median 
time to onset of the first SNARs was 9.0 days (range: 4 to 345 days). At the time of the data cut-off 
date, 12 of the 13 SNARs had resolved. At Day 28 (from the day of event onset), the probability of all 
the cases of SNARs having completely resolved was 91.2% (95% CI: 67.7, 99.5), and at Day 91 it was 
100%. There were no fatalities attributable to SNARs. The majority of the tisagenlecleucel-related 
SNARs required no specific protocol-defined intervention other than supportive care, unless an 
additional identified cause was defined (e.g. infection). 
Hematological disorders including cytopenias 
Post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 76 patients (78.4%) experienced AEs of the SOC hematological 
disorders including cytopenias, mostly of grade ≥ 3 (74.2%) severity. Forty-two patients (43.3%) had 
AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. These AEs were reported more frequently within the 
initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion than in the periods from >8 weeks to 1 year after infusion 
and >1 year after infusion (75.3% vs. 42.7% and 11.3%). 
Post-tisagenlecleucel hematological disorders including cytopenias most commonly reported (in ≥ 10% 
of the patients) were neutropenia (42.3%), anemia (25.8%), WBC count decreased (21.6%), 
thrombocytopenia (19.6%), neutrophil count decreased (17.5%), febrile neutropenia (12.4%) and 
platelet count decreased (10.3%). 
Based on KM analysis of hematological laboratory parameters, by Month 6 the probability of resolution 
of all the cytopenias (leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia) ranged 
from 70% to 100% (see Table below).  
These AEs were generally managed with standard measures of observation, blood product support, 
growth factors and/or antibiotics, as indicated in the protocol.

Prolonged depletion of normal B-cells/agammaglobulinemia 
At the time of study entry, 25 patients (25.8%) had hypogammaglobulinemia, 2 patients (2.1%) had 
blood immunoglobulin G decreased. Sixteen patients (16.5%) had AEs of prolonged depletion of 
normal B-cells/agammaglobulinemia post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. These AEs were ongoing in 10 
patients at the time of the data cut-off date. Of the 16 patients, 10 patients (10.3%) had AEs 
suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. One patient had a grade 3 AE. No grade 4 AEs were 
reported. Prophylactic iv immunoglobulins were administered to 33 patients. None of the AEs were 
serious or led to fatal infections. 
Infections 
Infections occurring at any time post-infusion were reported in 48 patients (49.5%), 13 (13.4%) of 
whom had infections suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. Most of the patients had either grade 
1 or 2 infections. Grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 15 patients (15.5%), 8 of whom (8.2%) had 
AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. There were no patients with grade 4 or fatal infections. 
The majority of the patients had infections either within the initial 8 weeks (n=18, 18.6%) or in the 
period from >8 weeks to 1 year post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (n=37, 38.5%). Only 5 patients had 
infections >1 year after the infusion. Infections were managed with standard supportive measures and 
antibiotics. 
Tumor lysis syndrome 
TLS was reported in 2 patients (2.1%):  
• 
• 
In a 46-year-old male patient, the TLS (grade 3), which was suspected to be related to 
tisagenlecleucel by the Investigator, started on Day 10 and resolved on Day 16 with 
rasburicase treatment. 
In a 42-year-old male patient, disease progression was diagnosed on Day 93. The patient 
developed TLS (grade 3) on Day 125 that was not suspected by the Investigator to be related 
to tisagenlecleucel but to progressive disease. Of note, the patients received treatment with 
etoposide, carboplatin, ifosfamide and rituximab from Day 128 to Day 131. The TLS resolved 
on Day 132 with treatment (allopurinol). 
There were no AEs reported concerning Cerebral edema, Generation of replication competent 
lentivirus, Transmission of infectious agents and Decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling 
of the product. 
Aggravation of GVHD 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022

GVHD was observed in one patient. This patient experienced disease progression on Day 91 post-
infusion and subsequently received allogeneic SCT on Day 246. On Day 278, a diagnosis of grade 2 
skin GVHD was made; it resolved with sequelae on Day 288 with treatment (tacrolimus and 
mycophenolate). On Day 292, the patient had grade 3 intestinal GVHD that was considered an SAE. 
The patient was given the same treatment as the first GVHD episode and the event resolved on Day 
345. The events were not suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel but to allogeneic transplant by 
the Investigator. 
Secondary malignancies (including vector insertion site oligo/monoclonality) 
Secondary malignancies were reported in 4 patients (4.1%) of which only one suspected to be related 
to both LD chemotherapy and tisagenlecleucel by the Investigator. The rest of the cases were not 
suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel.  
Laboratory findings 
Local clinical laboratory parameters collected in Study E2202 included hematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, coagulation, pregnancy screening, influenza, viral serology and serum immunoglobulin 
levels. Laboratory data were classified into CTCAE grades using version 4.03. For laboratory tests 
where grades were not defined by CTCAE 4.03, results were graded by the low/normal/high 
classifications based on laboratory normal ranges. 
Hematologic laboratory abnormalities 
Hematologic laboratory abnormalities were frequent. Post-tisagenlecleucel cytopenias were seen in 
78.4% of patients. The hematological laboratory parameters that worsened to grade 3/4 post-baseline 
most commonly (in >50% of patients) are shown in Table 54.

Table 54 Hematology laboratory abnormalities post-tisagenlecleucel infusion based on 
CTCAE grade (Safety set)  
The most common (>25%) Grade 3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were lymphocyte 
count decreased (87%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (71%), 
platelet count decreased (26%) and haemoglobin decreased (25%) (data not shown).   
Clinical chemistry 
Post-baseline clinical chemistry abnormalities were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common clinical 
chemistry abnormalities that worsened to grade 3/4 post-baseline were decreased phosphate (10.9%), 
increased glucose (5.4%) and decreased potassium (5.2%). 
Liver enzymes 
Minor elevations of liver enzymes were observed in a limited numbers of patients - ALT or AST >3× 
ULN was noted in 6 patients, ALT or AST >5× ULN was noted in 2 patients, and total bilirubin >3× ULN 
was noted in 1 patient. One patient had ALT or AST >20x ULN. Four patients had total bilirubin 
(TBL) >2x ULN. There were no serious adverse hepatic events reported.

Urinalysis 
Findings below or above normal ranges for urinary parameters were infrequent. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Abnormal vital signs values, high fever in particular, were mainly associated with events of CRS. The 
abnormal values eventually returned to normal levels with supportive care and were reported as AEs 
when considered clinically relevant by the Investigator. 
Safety in special populations 
In Study E2202, the incidence of AEs was analysed in different subgroups by gender, race, ethnicity, 
and bulkiness of the disease and it was noted that there were no major differences observed in AE 
incidences across these subgroups.

There were no patients with positive pregnancy results at baseline or during the study. However, there 
was one case of pregnancy of a female partner of a male patient (Patient 2008-004). No further 
information was available at the time of this report. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No information provided. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patients discontinued the study due to adverse events at time of DCO (29 March 2021). 
Immunological events 
Humoral immunogenicity 
A patient was only defined as positive for tisagenlecleucel treatment-induced or -boosted anti-mCAR19 
antibodies when the anti-mCAR19 antibody median fluorescence intensity (MFI) at any time post-
infusion was at least 2.28-fold higher than pre-infusion levels for patients whose baseline status was 
positive (boosted) or if the baseline status was negative but any post-baseline interpretation was 
positive (induced). Treatment-induced or boosted anti-mCAR19 antibodies were observed in 27 
patients in the CKAS (cellular kinetics analysis set), while 56 patients did not show induced or boosted 
response.

Table 56: Humoral immunity – Safety set. 
* Summary of at any time post-baseline also includes unscheduled assessments. Patients are counted as positive if 
they have one or more positive samples post-baseline, otherwise negative if they have at least one negative sample 
post baseline and otherwise unknown.  
The geometric mean AUC0-28d was similar in both the groups, whereas the geometric mean AUC0-
84d and Cmax were observed to be 46% higher in patients with treatment-induced or boosted anti-
mCAR19 antibodies post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. CTL019 Transgene levels were found to be highest 
amongst patients with unknown anti-mCAR19 antibody (Figure 32).  
The pre-existing antibodies, i.e. at enrollment, or maximum fold change from baseline to post-infusion 
were not associated with any impact on clinical response (Figure 30 and Figure 31) There was no 
apparent relationship between CRS grade and maximum fold change from baseline for anti-mCAR19 
antibody levels. There were no grade 3 / 4 CRS events within 8 weeks of infusion.

Treatment-boosted or treatment induced anti-mCAR19 antibodies did not appear to have an impact on 
the in vivo expansion of CAR-positive T-cells and persistence or clinical response.

Cellular immunogenicity 
Activation of T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from patients in response to 
mCAR19-derived peptides was used to assess the cellular immunogenicity against tisagenlecleucel. T-
cell activation was measured by the percentage of interferon gamma (IFNg+) cells by flow cytometry. 
The response measured by the assay is referred to as net response (%) and calculated for two 
mCAR19 peptide pools (Pool 1 and Pool 2). The two nonidentical peptide pools are comprised of 
approximately 60 overlapping 15-mer peptides, each, which are derived from the mCAR19 protein 
sequence. 
The analysis for net response (%) versus the exposure metrics suggested no apparent relationship 
between the cellular immunogenicity responses and in vivo expansion and persistence of 
tisagenlecleucel transgene. 
Cellular responses to mCART peptides were measured pre-infusion (enrollment) and post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion. In general, cellular immunogenicity responses were consistent and remained 
low (<1%) for most patients throughout the study, demonstrating that cellular immunogenicity does 
not fluctuate over time. 
The analysis for the maximum net response post-baseline, for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses for 
both Pool 1 and Pool 2 peptides, by BOR response, suggested cellular immunogenicity did not impact 
clinical outcome.

Post marketing experience 
In the post marketing setting between 13-Aug-2020 and 12-Feb-2021, cumulatively an estimated 
3223 patients (1116 patients with B-ALL and 2107 with DLBCL) have been treated worldwide [PSUR 5-
Section 5.2.1]. There were no new or changing safety signals based on the evaluation of safety data 
obtained during the PSUR 5 reporting interval or cumulatively. A critical analysis of the efficacy and 
safety data revealed that the overall benefit-risk profile of tisagenlecleucel remains favourable.  
Supportive data  
Supportive data from the pivotal study A2101J 
The study included 38 patients diagnosed with DLBCL (n = 24) or FL (n = 14). Among the 14 patients 
with FL in Study A2101J, the median age was 59 years (range: 43-72 years). Half of the patients were 
female (7/14). 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy in Study A2101J included bendamustine; cyclophosphamide alone or 
in combination with fludarabine or radiation therapy; carboplatin+gemcitabine and modified EPOCH 
(doxorubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide). 
The most comprehensive description of the AE profile in Study A2101J is available from the 2-year 
follow-up. At this follow-up, most AEs were of grade 1 or 2 in severity with only a few grade 3 or 4 
AEs, and only one grade 5 AE (Schuster et al 2017). 
The publication by Schuster et al 2017 describes efficacy and safety in 28 patients enrolled in the 
study. Severe cytokine-release syndrome occurred in 5 patients (18%). Serious encephalopathy 
occurred in 3 patients (11%); 2 cases were self-limiting and 1 case was fatal. All patients in complete 
remission by 6 months remained in remission at 7.7 to 37.9 months (median, 29.3 months) after 
induction, with a sustained reappearance of B cells in 8 of 16 patients and with improvement in levels 
of IgG in 4 of 10 patients and of IgM in 6 of 10 patients at 6 months or later and in levels of IgA in 3 of 
10 patients at 18 months or later. 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 137/154 
 
 
 
 
Sixteen of 28 patients experienced a CRS. Five patients had CRS events that were grade ≥3 in severity. 
One patient was treated with tocilizumab, experienced a rapid reversal of symptoms and had a 
complete response to treatment. No patients received glucocorticoids. No patient died due to CRS 
(Schuster et al 2017). 
Eleven patients had neurotoxic events such as encephalopathy, delirium, tremor, cognitive 
disturbance, confusion, involuntary movements, memory impairment suspected to be related to 
tisagenlecleucel therapy. All the events were less than grade 3, except 3 events of grade ≥ 3 
encephalopathy occurring in 3 individual patients. One 43-year-old male patient with prior history of 
optic atrophy developed CRS grade 2 and encephalopathy on Day 8 post tisagenlecleucel. He 
experienced protracted worsening of neurological disease and died from encephalopathy on Day 232. 
Post-mortem of this patient revealed diffuse gliosis with severe, widespread neuronal loss and 
degeneration of white matter but did not reveal a viral cause for the PML. There was no evidence of 
herpes simplex virus 1 or 2, cytomegalovirus, varicella–zoster virus, JC virus, adenovirus, or Epstein–
Barr virus. The investigator stated that antecedent history of optic atrophy suggests that the patient 
might have had autoimmune CNS disease prior to receiving tisagenlecleucel (see Section 1.1.3.1.7). 
With the exception of this fatal event, the neurologic symptoms were selflimiting and resolved fully 
within 1 week (Schuster et al 2017, Chong et al 2021). 
At the 5-year follow-up, limited safety data is available from 38 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel. 
Of note, 6 of 38 (16%) patients had secondary malignancies. No cases of RCL were detected (Chong et 
al 2021). No further data on adverse events was described in the publication.  
Death 
One patient with a history of optic atrophy died due to encephalopathy that led to progressive 
neurologic deterioration in Study A2101J. This death was reported at the time of the 2-year follow-up. 
(Schuster et al 2017). No additional deaths were reported in the 5-year follow-up (Chong et al 2021). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data are provided for the indication r/r FL (relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma) based on 
data from the pivotal phase 2 Study E2202, including 97 patients treated with tisagenlecleucel infusion 
with a median duration of follow-up post-infusion of 16.59 months (range: 10.3 to 25.7 months). The 
enrolment of this study is complete, although the study is ongoing. Seventy-one patients had been 
followed-up >1 year at the data cut-off for the study. 
The pivotal study has few patients included, indicating only common AEs are captured, but the data 
presented seems reassuring as AEs events reported in the study is similar to what has been seen in 
adult patients with other NHL indications (B-cell ALL and DLBCL); almost all (99.0%) having at least 
one AE following tisagenlecleucel infusion.  
The current follow-up time is short for capturing long-term AEs. The study is ongoing and all patients 
will be followed for 12 months from infusion. After the end of this study, patients will continue to be 
followed for long-term safety under the long-term follow-up protocol CCTL019A2205B, a category 3 
PASS. The purpose of this PASS is to monitor all patients treated with lentiviral vector based CD19 CAR 
-T- cell therapy in clinical trials for 15 years from the last CD19 CAR -T-cell infusion, to assess the risk 
of delayed AEs suspected to be related to CD19 CAR -T-cell therapy. Based on these aspects the 
number of patients and follow-up time is considered acceptable. 
Most common AEs irrespective of tisagenlecleucel relationship are cytokine release syndrome (CRS, 
49.5%) and cytopenias like neutropenia (42.3%), anaemia (25.8%), white blood cell count decreased 
(21.6%) and thrombocytopenia (19.6%) and febrile neutropenia (12.4%). Hypogammaglobulinemia 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 138/154 
 
 
 
 
were seen in 14.4%. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 12.4% of the patients. Other very common 
AEs were headache (24.7%), diarrhoea (21.6%) and pyrexia (19.6%). 
Cytopenias Grade ≥3 was very common: Neutropenia (42.3%), anaemia (16.5%), white blood cell 
count decreased (17.5%) and thrombocytopenia (11.3%). All cases with febrile neutropenia were of 
Grade ≥3. 
A high degree of the AEs (78.4%) is suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. Most common 
treatment related AEs was CRS (48.5%), headache (7.2%) and blood and lymphatic system disorders 
like neutropenia (20.6%), anaemia (13.4%), thrombocytopenia (7.2%) and febrile neutropenia 
(6.2%). Most common grade ≥3 study drug-related AE was neutropenia (20.6%). 
As observed in other NHL indications, the majority of the AEs occurred within the initial 8-week period 
post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (96.9%). Still a high frequency of patients experienced AEs after this 
time period: 83.3% between 8 weeks and 1 year post-infusion. The frequency is however significantly 
lower > 1 year post-infusion (26.8%). 
Cytokine release syndrome was an expected AE with tisagenlecleucel treatment. The frequency of CRS 
(48.5%) seems to be similar to what have been seen in patients with DLBCL (57%) in study 
CCTL019C2201. However, in contrast to patients with DLBCL (Grade 3/4 CRS: 23%), no patients with 
r/r FL had grade 3 or 4 CRS. This difference might be partly explained by the less aggressive nature of 
the FL disease, partly by the revised CRS management algorithm, which is now reflected in the 
proposed SmPC. The use of a modified treatment algorithm includes earlier use of tocilizumab in the 
presence of mild symptoms requiring intervention. The revised algorithm is considered acceptable. 
All CRS cases occurred within 8 weeks with median TTO 4.0 days (range:1-14 days) and median 
duration was 4 days (range:1 to 24 days). Systemic anti-cytokine treatment with tocilizumab or 
corticosteroids was required in 17.5% of patients experiencing CRS. One grade 5 CRS syndrome 
occurring >1 year post-infusion were considered unlikely related to tisegenlecleucel infusion (see 
below).  
Serious neurological adverse reactions (SNARs) were reported in 11.3%. Grade3 and 4 AEs 
(ICANS/encephaloapthy and/or delirium) were reported in 3 patients (3%). The median TTO was 9.0 
days (range:4 to 345 days). It is estimated that by D91 post-infusion all SNARs have completely 
resolved without specific protocol-defined interventions other than supportive care. The MAH includes 
both serious and non-serious neurological reactions under the umbrella called SNARs.  
ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) is a new PT added as an ADR in 
SmPC section 4.8, table 2, which is considered acceptable. The proposed frequency is “common”, 
which seems reasonable based on the number of cases described in the E2202 study. A footnote listing 
symptoms associated with ICANS is added. 
Monitoring and management of ICANS is discussed in literature recently. It is agreed that the 
combined information on monitoring of neurological adverse reactions reflective of ICANS in (several 
sections of) the SmPC is adequate and that no further guidance is warranted. 
A paragraph on ICANs as selected adverse events in the paragraph concerning Neurological adverse 
reactions in section 4.8. is adequately implemented. 
Cytopenias were reported in 78.4% of patients, of which 74.2% had grade ≥3. These AEs were 
reported more frequently within the initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion than in the periods 
from >8 weeks to 1 year after infusion and >1 year after infusion (75.3% vs. 42.7% and 11.3%). 
Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis of hematological laboratory parameters, by month 6 the probability of 
resolution of all cytopenias range from 70% to 100%. The most common (>25%) Grade 3 and 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 139/154 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
haematological laboratory abnormalities were lymphocyte count decreased (87%), white blood cell 
count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (71%), platelet count decreased (26%) and 
haemoglobin decreased (25%). 
Infections are among the most common safety concerns following CAR-T treatment and is included as 
an important safety concern in the RMP. In FL patients infections were reported in 49.5% of patients, a 
somewhat lower frequency than seen in the DLBCL patients in study CCTL019C2201 (58%). Grade ≥3 
infections were reported in 15.5% of patients. There were no grade 4 infection, but one grade 5 case, 
a suspected case of PML about 8 months post-infusion. Causality was not assessable according to the 
MAH. PML is associated with a life-threatening opportunistic viral infection (JC virus). Cumulatively 
three cases of PML are listed in PSUR 5 for tisagenlecleucel. Two cases of PML have been reported in 
the literature suspected to be related to CAR-T cell treatment (axicabtagene ciloleucel) occurring 14 
months and 7 months post-infusion.  
In the SmPC section 4.4 it is informed that “Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal 
infections, occurred frequently in patients after Kymriah infusion (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated appropriately” and “Infections - pathogen 
unspecified, viral infections, bacterial infections” is listed as very common ADR in SmPC section 4.8.  
PML is not listed specifically as side effect of Kymriah. It is not considered that patients with FL are at 
higher risk of opportunistic infections or PML than other lymphoma patients treated with 
tisagenlecleucel or other CAR-T cell products. The MAH has, as requested, presented narratives of all 
suspected cases with late occurrence of opportunistic infections, agreed to include a text regarding 
monitoring for late occurrence of opportunistic CNS infections in the SmPC section 4.4, and agreed to 
update the RMP and educational materials accordingly. This is acceptable. 
Prolonged depletion of normal B-cells/agammaglobulinemia were seen in 25.8% of patients. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia were reported in 14.4%, similar to what was seen in the DLBCL population 
(17%). One patient had a grade 3 AE. No grade 4 AEs were reported. 10 patients (10.3%) had 
hypogammaglobulinaemia suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. There were two cases of Tumor 
lysis syndrome, of which one was considered related to tisagenlecleucel. There was observed one case 
of GVHD, however this case was not suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Secondary malignancies were reported in 4 patients. Two events in one patient – a grade 2 squamous 
cell carcinoma on Day 283 and a grade 2 malignant melanoma on Day 324 - were suspected to be 
related to both LD chemotherapy and tisagenlecleucel. The events in the three other patients were not 
suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel 
No AEs concerning Cerebral edema, Generation of replication competent lentivirus, Transmission of 
infectious agents and Decrease in cell viability due to inappropriate handling of the product were 
reported in study E2202 in r/r FL patients. 
Seven patients died during the course of the study, with all deaths occurring >30 days post 
tisagenlecleucel infusion. Of these 7 deaths, 5 occurred due to progression of the underlying disease. 
The one death related to CRS syndrome occurring >1 year post-infusion, seems less likely to be 
related to tisagenlecleuecel infusion since transgene levels had been decreasing and were below the 
limit of sensitivity at Month 6 and Month 9 (6 and 3 months before the death, respectively). The other 
deaths was a possible case of PML (see above). 
Supportive data from the pilot study A2101J are provided, based on two publications, one presenting 
data from a 2-year follow-up, the other from 5-year follow-up. The study includes 14 patients with FL. 
The most frequent AEs events were CRS and neurotoxicity. The safety data from the 5-year follow-up 
Assessment report

is not described in detail, but overall, safety data presented from the pilot study A2101J seems in line 
with what has been seen in the pivotal study E2202.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The AEs events reported in the pivotal study including r/r FL patients are similar to what has been seen 
in adult patients with other NHL indications (B-cell ALL and DLBCL). CRS, cytopenias, infections and 
neurotoxicity are the most common AEs and most frequently reported first 8 weeks following 
tisagenlecleucel infusion.  
The revised CRS management algorithm used in the study of FL patients recommends earlier use of 
systemic anti-cytokine treatment with tocilizumab or corticosteroids. It is considered acceptable that 
the revised algorithm is now proposed included in the SmPC section 4.4.  
Serious neurological adverse reactions (SNARs) including cases classified as ICANS were reported in 
11.3% and it is considered acceptable that ICANS is included as a specific term in SmPC section 4.8..  
It can be concluded that the unfavourable effects and risks can be addressed by adequate risk 
mitigation measures in the SmPC and RMP,  which is considered acceptable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: No 
major changes to the PL have been introduced only minor text additions where done. The layout and 
design of the artwork has not been changed.   
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines 
of systemic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The management of symptomatic relapsed or refractory FL in the EU includes non-cross resistant 
chemo-immunotherapy agents, radio-immunotherapy, rituximab monotherapy, the PI3K inhibitor 
idelalisib and duvelisib, the combination of rituximab and lenalidomide, obinutuzumb in combination 
with bendamustine, and in selected cases autologous/allogeneic HSCT. The PI3K inhibitor idelalisib has 
been approved in the EU since 2014, for the treatment of relapsed FL after at least two prior lines of 
systemic therapy, with a CRR of 14%, ORR of 56% and DOR of 11.8 months (Salles et al 2017). 
Duvelisib is another PI3K inhibitor approved by EMA in May 2021 for the treatment of adult patients 
with refractory FL who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapies, with a 0% CRR and 40% PRR 
(Copiktra SmPC). The lenalidomide and rituximab combination (so-called R2) was approved by EMA in 
2019 for the treatment of FL patients after at least 1 prior line of therapy, with a CRR of 34% and ORR 
of 81% (Rummel et al 2020). High-dose therapy (HDT) followed by ASCT can be a therapeutic option 
for certain patients with relapsed FL. The median PFS and OS in patients who relapsed after ASCT 
(n=95) was approximately 1 year after relapse (Sesques et al 2020). Allogeneic HSCT is a potentially 
curative therapy, and can be considered at relapse after autologous HSCT, but only a small fraction of 
patients with an available donor are candidates for it. Transplant-related mortality is 8-17% at 1 year 
(Epperla et al 2017), with a 3-year OS of 66%, and treatment-related mortality of 25% at 3 years 
(Sureda et al 2018). 
The ESMO clinical guidelines specify which treatments are considered appropriate for which groups in 
the r/r FL population (Dreyling, 2021). In general, FL grade 1, 2 and 3a should be treated as indolent 
disease, whereas grade 3b should be treated as an aggressive lymphoma (Dreyling, 2021). In the case 
of relapsed disease, localised symptomatic disease may be managed with low-dose ISRT, while in early 
systemic relapses (<12-24 months), a non-cross resistant chemoimmunotherapy regimen is used. 
Rituximab is added if the previous antibody-containing scheme achieved >6-12-month DOR. Rituximab 
maintenance therapy every 3 months for up to 2 years is recommended for most r/r FL patients, 
except for those who have relapsed during their first rituximab maintenance period (Dreyling et al. 
2021; Vidal et al. 2011). In rituximab-refractory cases or remissions lasting <6 months, 
obinutuzumab-bendamustine (or other chemotherapy regimen) plus obinutuzumab maintenance is 
recommended. High-dose chemotherapy with ASCT may be considered in patients with short-term first 
remissions after rituximab-containing regimens. In relapsed FL, lenalidomide plus rituximab may be 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 147/154 
 
 
 
considered for patients with short remissions after chemotherapy. In symptomatic cases with low 
tumour burden, rituximab monotherapy may be applied. Radioimmunotherapy with yttrium-90 [90Y]-
radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan may be considered in elderly patients with comorbidities. In later 
relapses, a non-chemotherapy approach is recommended, including treatment with lenalidomide plus 
rituximab, and idelalisib and duvelisib in double-refractory cases. In selected younger patients with 
later relapses with a high-risk profile or relapse after ASCT, allogeneic HSCT may be considered.  
There is an unmet medical need in r/r FL in that treatment efficacy and duration of remission decline 
with every successive line of therapy. In the third or later lines of therapy, the overall proportion of 
patients with DOR >6 months among all treated patients remains low at only 18-30%. Death occurrs 
due to histological transformation to DLBCL or because FL becomes refractory to chemotherapy. Thus, 
there can be considered to be an unmet medical need in FL patients with frequent relapses, where 
therapies generally result in modest CRR and responses are not durable, thus necessitating further 
treatments with associated toxicities and the risk of histological transformation.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH has submitted data from one ongoing pivotal phase 2 study E2202 (ELARA) in adult patients 
with r/r FL. In addition, they have submitted the results from a completed supportive pilot phase IIa 
study, A2101J, which is reported in two articles and where the MAH does not have access to individual 
patient data. To contextualise the findings presented in the pivotal single-arm study E2202, the MAH 
carried out two analyses of real-world data, ReCORD and Flatiron, in addition to a systematic literature 
review.  
The pivotal study E2202 is an ongoing open-label, multicenter, single arm, phase 2 study, designed to 
determine the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with r/r FL. Eligible patients were 
either i) refractory to a second line or later line of systemic therapy (including an anti-CD20 antibody 
and an alkylating agent) or relapsed within 6 months after completion of a second line or later line of 
systemic therapy or ii) relapsed during anti-CD20 antibody maintenance (following at least two lines of 
therapies as above) or within 6 months after maintenance completion or iii) relapsed after autologous 
HSCT. The primary endpoint was CRR as assessed by IRC, according to the Lugano response criteria 
(Cheson et al., 2014). CRR was defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR recorded from 
tisagenlecleucel infusion until PD or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever came first. The null 
hypothesis in study E2202 was CRR being less than or equal to 15% at a 1-sided cumulative 2.5% 
level of significance, i.e. H0: p ≤ 0.15 vs. Ha: p >0.15. This hypothesis was based on the CRR reported 
for idelalisib in a similar patient population (Salles et al., 2017). 
Autologous T-cells were harvested from eligible patients who then underwent optional bridging therapy 
and lymphodepleting chemotherapies while the harvested cells were processed into the study product 
Tisagenlecleucel was then re-administered via a single intravenous infusion at a target dose of 0.6 to 
6.0×108 CAR-positive, viable T cells. 
The data provided is based on an extended follow up analysis when 97 patients were infused with 
tisagenlecleucel and 90 patients had either completed 12 months of follow-up from the time of infusion 
or had discontinued earlier. 119 patients were screened, 21 of which did not meet the exclusion 
criteria. 98 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients who received a tisagenlecleucel infusion 
(n=97) were included in the Tisagenlecleucel infused set and the Safety set. Of these, 94 patients who 
had measurable disease at baseline per IRC were included in the EAS. Nine patients were excluded 
from the EAS to form the PPS (n=85). The first visit for the first patient was on 12-Nov-2018. The DCO 
for the interim analysis was 26-May-2020. The DCO for the extended follow-up analysis was 29-Mar-
Assessment report

2021. Database lock was on 07-May-2021. The DCO date for subsequent extended follow-up analysis 
was 03-Aug-2021. The study was ongoing at the time of CAT/CAHMP opinion.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was CRR determined by IRC in the EAS was met at the interim analysis (DCO: 
26-May-2020), with a CRR of 65.4% (34/52; 99.5% CI: 45.1, 82.4). The result was statistically 
significant at a 1-sided critical alpha level of 0.0025 to reject the H0 of CRR ≤ 15%. No further 
significance testing was done at the primary and extended follow-up analyses. At the DCO of 29-Mar-
2021, after a median of 16.9 months (range: 10.3-25.7) of follow-up, the CRR was 69.1% (65/94; 
95% CI: 58.8, 78.3).  
Subgroup analyses showed that the CRRs in various demographic and prognostic subgroups, including 
high-risk patients such as those with high FLIPI score (36/57; 63.2%; 95% CI: 49.3, 75.6), those with 
POD24 (36/61; 59%; 95%CI:45.7, 71.4), those who were double refractory (43/65; 66.2%; 95%CI: 
53.4, 77.4), and those who were refractory to last line of prior therapy (51/74; 68.9%; 95%CI: 57.1, 
79.2) were consistent with that observed in the overall study population. The CRR values by IRC 
assessment ranged from 40.0% to 87.9% in all subgroups analysed. The secondary endpoints were 
supportive of the observed benefit in terms of CRR. The ORR was 86.2% (81/94; 95% CI: 77.5, 92.4) 
per IRC assessment at the 29-Mar-2021 DCO. CRR and ORR remained unchanged at a later DCO (03-
Aug-2021). 
The median DOR per IRC assessment at the DCO of 29-Mar-2021 was not reached, but the estimated 
probability of remaining in response at 9 months was 76.0% (95% CI: 64.6, 84.2). The median OS 
was not reached. The estimated probability of survival was 91.6% (95% CI: 81.7, 96.2) at Month 18. 
At a later DCO (03-Aug-2021), with median follow up of 21 months (range: 14-30) in the EAS, 9-
month DOR, 12-month PFS and OS remained unchanged from the previous DCO. Median PFS increased 
from 18.4 months to 29.5 months, with the caveat of a low number of patients at risk after month 25. 
Supportive evidence for CRR and durable responses comes from the A2101J study 5 year follow up 
analysis. At a median follow-up of 28.6 months, DOR and OS were not reached. CRR was 71% (10/14) 
at 6 months. The probability of remaining in response was 60% (95% CI: 25, 83) at 5 years.  
Contextualisation of the results was provided by two RWD studies, ReCORD and Flatiron. These 
showed a clinically meaningful difference in CRR to study E2202 of 31.8% (95% CI: 18.1, 45.3) and 
51.4% (95% CI: 21.2, 68.8), for ReCORD and Flatiron studies, respectively The Kaplan-Meier estimate 
of the OS rate at 12 months was 96.6% [95% CI: 92.9%, 100%] in Study E2202, 71.7% [95% CI: 
61.2%, 82.2%] in ReCORD (HR=0.2 [95% CI:0.02, 0.38]), and 84.5% [95% CI: 64.9%, 95.9%] in 
Flatiron (HR=0.41 [95% CI: 0.11, 1.47]).  
In a systemic literature review, based on a historical cohort, a similar effect size was only observed for 
axicabtagene ciloleucel which uses the same overall technology as tisagenlecleucel.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The E2202 pivotal single arm phase 2 trial was not a randomised controlled study. This can be 
understood in light of the rarity of the condition, poor prognosis and low response rates to currently 
available therapies, but nevertheless poses uncertainty. The sample size was also limited, with 94 
patients included in the EAS. Patients with FL grade 3b were excluded from the pivotal study, but are 
nonetheless included in the sought indication. Further, few patients with grade 3a FL were included. 
The primary endpoint, CRR, is not an established surrogate endpoint in r/r FL and thus needs to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/211805/2022  
Page 149/154 
 
 
 
supported by sufficiently mature DOR data. At the most recent DCO of 03-Aug-2021, median DOR was 
not reached, thus hampering precise comparisons with external data sets, but nonetheless suggesting 
a durable response. Some support for a sustained DOR is provided in the supportive study A2101J, 
which had longer follow-up, but very few FL patients (n=14) included. The reference CR rate of 15% 
used for hypothesis testing was based on the CRR from the approved PI3K inhibitor idelalisib. 
However, the idelalisib pivotal study includer older and more refractory patients than study E2202, 
thus the validity of the applied reference CR is uncertain. In addition, the interpretation of the efficacy 
results of tisagenlecleucel in terms of relevant time-to-event endpoints such as PFS and OS is difficult 
based on data from only one single-arm study. 
To attempt to contextualize the single arm data, RWE derived from two RW databases, ReCORD and 
Flatiron was used. However, the RWE was not able to incorporate all inclusion criteria from the E2202 
study, and information relating to some important baseline characteristics, such as FLIPI score, was 
unavailable or had missing values in the RW data such that the patient populations were not identical, 
which could not be adjusted for in the analysis, limiting comparability. Also, response assessments 
were lacking in the RW databases, leading to changes in definition of the PFS endpoint for the analysis, 
or further exclusion of otherwise eligible patients, potentially introducing bias and increasing 
uncertainty.  
While the QoL data suggested that patient quality of life improved over time, and the questionnaires 
used were validated for the patient populations, not all patients responded to these questionnaires 
from baseline, and the number of respondents declined by month 18, providing a strong potential for 
selection bias. The reasons for the missing QoL data points included both technical issues, patient 
willingness to respond and complications arising from the covid-19 pandemic. Also, in the absence of a 
control arm, the PRO data are difficult to interpret. Not all RWD for contextualisation included quality of 
life data. In the infused set, 17.5% (17/97) received at least one new antineoplastic medication post 
tisagenlecleucel infusion, mostly due to SD or PD. Two patients received allogeneic HSCT. The timing 
and impact of these events on QoL data is unclear mainly due to missing data (no data for the two 
patients that received HSCT, and incomplete or missing data for the 17 patients that started new anti-
neoplastic treatment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The AEs events reported are similar to what has been seen in adult patients with other NHL indications 
(B-cell ALL and DLBCL). Almost all (99.0%) having at least one AE following tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
A high degree of the AEs (78.4%) are suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel. 
Most common AEs irrespective of tisagenlecleucel relationship are cytokine release syndrome (CRS, 
49.5%) and cytopenias like neutropenia (42.3%), anaemia (25.8%), white blood cell count decreased 
(21.6%) and thrombocytopenia (19.6%) and febrile neutropenia (12.4%). Hypogammaglobulinemia 
were seen in 14.4%. Other common AEs were headache (24.7%), diarrhoea (21.6%) and pyrexia 
(19.6%). 
Few patients had Grade ≥3 CRS (1.0%). Cytopenias Grade ≥3 was very common: Neutropenia 
(42.3%), anaemia (16.5%), white blood cell count decreased (17.5%) and thrombocytopenia (11.3%). 
All cases with febrile neutropenia were of Grade ≥3. 
Most common treatment related AEs was CRS (48.5%), headache (7.2%) and blood and lymphatic 
system disorders like neutropenia (20.6%), anaemia (13.4%), thrombocytopenia (7.2%) and febrile 
neutropenia (6.2%). Most common grade ≥3 study drug-related AE was neutropenia (20.6%).

As observed in other NHL indications, the majority of the AEs occurred within the initial 8-week period 
post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (96.9%). Still a high frequency of patients experienced AEs after this 
time period: 83.3% at > 8 weeks to 1 year post-infusion. The frequency is however significantly lower 
> 1 year post-infusion (26.8%). 
Infections were reported in 49.5% of patients. Grade ≥3 infections were reported in 15.5%. There were 
no grade 4 infection, but one grade 5 case with a possible PML. Late occurring life-threatening 
opportunistic viral infection that can introduce serious complications like PML, may occur following 
CAR-T treatment. The MAH has included a text regarding monitoring for late occurrence of 
opportunistic infections in the SmPC section 4.4 and in educational materials to make both HCP and 
patients aware of the risk. 
Neurological adverse reactions (SNARS) were reported in 11.3%. Grade≥ 3 AEs of ICANS (Immune 
effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) /encephaloapthy and/or delirium) were reported in 3 
patients (3%). ICANS is added to the list of ADRs in the SmPC.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study has few patients included (97 patients), indicating only common AEs are captured   
The current median follow-up time is short for capturing long-term AEs. However, the study is ongoing 
and all patients will be followed until the end of the study when all patients have completed month 24 
evaluation or discontinued prematurely. After the end of the pivotal study, patients will continue to be 
followed for long-term safety under the long-term follow-up protocol for study A2205B, which is 
defined as a category 3 PASS. The purpose of this PASS is to monitor all patients treated with lentiviral 
vector based CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in clinical trials for up to 15 years from the last CD19 CAR-T cell 
infusion, to assess the risk of delayed AEs suspected to be related to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. 
Semiannual and annual evaluations will be performed during this study from the date of infusion on all 
patients. Based on these aspects the number of patients and follow-up time is considered acceptable.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Relapsed and refractory (r/r) FL represents an unmet medical need in that treatment efficacy and 
duration of remission declines with every successive line of therapy, with death occurring due to 
histological transformation to DLBCL or because FL becomes refractory to chemotherapy.  
The results from study E2202 indicate a robust CRR in the r/r FL population (69.1%, 95% CI:58.8%- 
78.3%) in response to a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel at a target dose of 0.6 to 6.0×108 CAR-
positive, viable T cells, with the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval above the pre-specified 
threshold of 15%. The observed CR rate was consistent across high-risk subgroups. Achieving CR, i.e. 
the disappearance of all measurable evidence of disease, is considered relevant for the patient and 
therefore indicative of a relevant favourable effect.  
While the median DOR has not been reached in the pivotal study as the follow-up duration is currently 
too short, achieving a sustained DOR provides some indication that patients may achieve long-term 
remission. Supportive data from study A2101J also suggest potential for a sustained duration of 
response.

Results from secondary endpoints support the primary endpoint. In particular, ORR was 86.2% 
(95%CI: 77.5%-92.4%). Median DOR and OS were not reached, which compares favourably with the 
literature and indicates that the high response rates may translate into a clinical and/or survival 
benefit. 
The main uncertainties regarding the B/R assessment relate to the limited sample size and short 
duration of follow up. Some uncertainties regarding the formal extrapolation to patients with FL grade 
3b remain, as these were not included in the pivotal trial. It is, however, thought that such an 
extrapolation is permissible, as in clinical practice, FL grade 3b is often treated as DLBCL, for which 
tisagenlecleucel is also indicated. Few patients with grade 3a were also included in the pivotal trial. 
Further, there are challenges related to RWE, including capturing an appropriate patient population in 
RW data. However, the uncertainties of the RWE do not detract from the clinical data which showed a 
substantial effect size. 
Based on the number of patients included in the pivotal study, only common AEs have been reported. 
The safety profile in FL patients seems to be similar to what has been seen in other NHL indications 
approved for tisagenlecleucel. Most important safety concerns are cytopenias, CRS, infections and 
neurological reactions. Long-term safety could not be assessed based on the data provided, but will be 
further studied under the long-term follow-up protocol CCTL019A2205B (PASS). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R balance of tisagenlecleucel for the heavily pre-treated patients with r/r FL included in 
study E2202 is considered favourable. Some uncertainties remain concerning the clinical data, such as 
short follow-up duration and limited sample size and single arm study design. However, the benefits 
for the treated population are considered to outweigh the unfavourable effects and risks which can be 
addressed by adequate risk mitigation measures in the SmPC and RMP.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kymriah is positive.  
The MAH should submit the inspection report, including a summary of the findings, for site 1700 (study 
E2202), when available (LEG). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CAT considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular 
lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic treatment for Kymriah. As a consequence, Sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and corresponding sections in the Package Leaflet are 
updated accordingly. The RMP has been updated to version 4.2 to align with the indication extension. 
The updates to Module 3 include mainly the incoming FL material characterization, final product 
characterization and FL batch analyses data. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Kymriah is not similar to Gazyvaro within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CAT reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Besremi 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
On 13 December 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Besremi, 
intended for the treatment of polycythaemia vera without symptomatic splenomegaly. Besremi was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product on 9 December 2011. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG. 
Besremi will be available as a solution for injection (250 microgram/0.5 ml and 500 microgram /0.5 ml). The 
active substance of Besremi is ropeginterferon alfa-2b (ATC code: L03AB15), which inhibits the proliferation 
of hematopoietic and bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells and antagonises the action of growth factors 
and other cytokines involved in the development of myelofibrosis. 
The benefits with Besremi are its ability to achieve complete haematological responses in patients with 
polycythaemia vera. The most common side effects are leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia, fatigue, 
flu-like illness and myalgia. 
The full indication is: "Besremi is indicated as monotherapy in adults for the treatment of polycythaemia vera 
without symptomatic splenomegaly." It is proposed that Besremi is prescribed by physicians experienced in 
the management of the disease.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

Summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Sylvant 
(siltuximab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Sylvant, which details the measures to be 
taken in order to ensure that Sylvant is used as safely as possible. For more information on RMP 
summaries, see here. 
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the EPAR summary and the product information 
for Sylvant, which can be found on Sylvant’s EPAR page. 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
Castleman’s disease is a rare disorder of the lymphatic system (the network of vessels that transport 
fluid from tissues through the lymph nodes and into the bloodstream) in which cells in lymph nodes 
start growing abnormally, causing benign tumours. The disease is called ‘multicentric’ when it affects 
several lymph nodes as well as other organs in the body. Patients have many general symptoms, 
including tiredness, fever, sweating at night, loss of appetite, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in 
the hands and feet causing tingling or numbness) and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Patients 
with multicentric Castleman’s disease can have serious complications, such as problems with their 
immune system which make it difficult to fight infections, and lymphoma (a type of cancer). 
Although the precise incidence of Castleman’s disease is not known, it has been estimated at less than 
1 in 100,000 people in Europe. 
Summary of treatment benefits 
Sylvant is used to treat multicentric Castleman’s disease in adult patients who tested negative for the 
human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and the human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). The active 
substance in Sylvant, siltuximab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed 
to block the action of another protein in the body called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is thought to 
contribute to the abnormal growth of certain cells in the lymph nodes. By blocking the activity of IL-6 
Sylvant stops abnormal cell growth, thus decreasing the size of the lymph nodes and helping to reduce 
the symptoms of the disease. 
Sylvant was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in one main study. This study involved 79 
patients aged 18 years and older who were HIV-negative and HHV-8 negative. Patients in both groups 
also received other medicines to ease their symptoms. The main measure of how well Sylvant worked 
was the proportion of patients who responded to treatment for at least 18 weeks, as shown by a 50% 
reduction (‘partial response’) or complete disappearance (‘complete response’) of tumours and 
symptoms of the disease. Of 53 patients who received Sylvant, 17 showed a partial response and one 
showed a complete response, compared with none of the 26 patients who received placebo.

Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
There is no information in patients who have the localised form (in one lymph node, also called 
unicentric Castleman’s disease) of the disease or in patients who are HIV-positive and/or HHV-8-
positive. There is also no information about the use of Sylvant in children with multicentric Castleman’s 
disease; however, the disease occurs very rarely in children. 
Based on the results from the studies that were conducted to obtain marketing authorisation for 
Sylvant, there is no evidence to suggest that its effects would differ in different ethnic groups.

produce antibodies that affect 
platelets.

Important potential risks 
Risk 
Liver damage  
Serious infections 
What is known  
Increases in hepatic transaminases (liver 
enzymes) and bilirubin levels in the blood may 
occur in patients with Castleman’s disease, 
including those treated with Sylvant. This may 
mean that the liver has been damaged.  
Serious infections may develop in patients with 
Castleman’s disease, including those treated with 
Sylvant. Sylvant blocks the protein IL-6; since IL-
6 is also involved in fighting infections, blocking 
its effects may lead to infections and hide the 
signs of infection such as fever.  
High levels of haemoglobin (the protein in red 
Sylvant blocks the protein IL-6, which may lead to 
blood cells that carries oxygen around the body) 
an increase in haemoglobin above its normal 
and polycythaemia (increased number of red 
levels. This is an uncommon side effect with 
blood cells) 
Cancer 
Sylvant. 
Cancer (including lymphoma) may develop in 
patients with Castleman’s disease, including in 
those treated with Sylvant. Blocking IL-6 may 
have an effect on the immune system, which 
could theoretically increase the risk of cancer.  
Heart (cardiac) problems  
Heart problems may occur in patients with 
Castleman’s disease, including in those treated 
with Sylvant. Risk factors include high blood 
pressure, high levels of cholesterol in the blood, 
diabetes, smoking, age, male gender, being 
overweight, and a family history of cardiac

problems.  
Developing holes or tears in the stomach or bowel 
Tears in the stomach or bowel may develop in 
(gastrointestinal perforation) 
patients with Castleman’s disease, including those 
treated with Sylvant. Prevention includes a 
medical examination to see if a patient is at risk, 
for example having another disease that may 
increase the risk of this occurring. 
Production of antibodies against Sylvant 
The immune system may produce antibodies 
(immunogenicity) 
against Sylvant, which may cause a reaction 
during or after administration, or cause lack of 
effect of Sylvant. Prevention includes a medical 
examination to see if a patient is at risk, for 
example if the patient had a previous similar 
reaction after being treated with a monoclonal 
antibody. 
Missing information 
Risk 
What is known  
Use in pregnant or breastfeeding women 
Sylvant has not been studied in pregnant or 
Use in patients who are ≥65 years of age 
Sylvant has been studied in very few patients 
breastfeeding women. There is no information on 
the use of Sylvant in these patients, therefore 
Sylvant is not recommended in these patients. 
Use in children  
over 65 years of age. There is limited information 
on the use of Sylvant in these patients. 
Sylvant has not been studied in children, as 
Castleman’s disease occurs rarely in children. 
There is no information on the use of Sylvant in 
these patients. 
Use in patients who are infected with the HIV 
Sylvant has not been studied in patients who are 
virus 
infected with HIV. 
Use in patients who are infected with human 
Sylvant has not been studied in patients who are 
herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) 
infected with HHV-8. 
Use in patients who have received vaccines 
Sylvant has not been studied in patients who 
received vaccines during treatment with Sylvant. 
Therefore, there is no information on the use of 
Sylvant in these patients.  
Interaction between Sylvant and other medicines 
In animal models, IL-6 is known to increase the 
activity of liver enzymes belonging to the CYP450 
family, which are involved in breaking down 
medicines. In theory, binding of Sylvant to IL-6 
could cause increased processing of medicines by 
CYP450 enzymes, which could make them less 
effective.

What is known  
Use in patients with reduced liver function 
Sylvant has not been studied in patients with 
reduced liver function. There is limited 
information on the use of Sylvant in these 
patients. 
Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) which provides physicians, 
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals with details on how to use the medicine, and also 
describes the risks and recommendations for minimising them. Information for patients is available in 
lay language in the package leaflet. The measures listed in these documents are known as ‘routine risk 
minimisation measures’. 
The SmPC and the package leaflet are part of the medicine’s product information. The product 
information for Sylvant can be found on Sylvant’s EPAR page. 
This medicine has no additional risk minimisation measures.

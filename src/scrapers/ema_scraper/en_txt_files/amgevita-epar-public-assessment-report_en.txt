About the product 
AMGEVITA (ABP 501) is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Humira (adalimumab).  ABP 501 
is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody which binds and neutralizes human tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a cytokine which mediates the inflammatory response.  The amino acid 
sequence of ABP 501 is identical to that of the reference product, adalimumab.  The ABP 501 and 
adalimumab active ingredients are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells.  ABP 501 has the same dosage form and strength as adalimumab. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 11/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By binding TNFα and preventing its interaction with its receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptor 
superfamily (TNFRSF) 1A (p55) and TNFRSF1B (p75), adalimumab interferes with downstream 
signaling and thereby suppresses immune processes central to several chronic inflammatory diseases.  
Based on extensive similarity data presented herein, ABP 501 is expected to have a safety and efficacy 
profile similar to that of adalimumab in all indications approved for adalimumab.  Thus, the proposed 
indications for ABP 501 are based on those currently approved for adalimumab. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application is an abridged application for a similar biological medicinal 
product under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC.  
Similarity  is  claimed  to  Humira  (adalimumab)  as  the  reference  medicinal  product,  which  has  been 
marketed  in the  European  Union  for  over  10  years.  Humira  40  mg  solution  for  injection  in  a  prefilled 
syringe  was  first  authorised  in  the  EU  on  8  September  2003;  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  is 
AbbVie Ltd. 
ABP 501 is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody with an identical amino acid sequence to 
that of adalimumab. 
Two Scientific advices were obtained; the first one in November 2011 (EMEA/H/SA/2216/1/2011/111) 
and  a 
in  October  2012 
(EMEA/H/SA/2216/1/FU/1/2012/III),  with  questions  concerning  quality,  pre-clinical  and  clinical 
development: 
the  advice  provided  by  CHMP  was  obtained 
follow-up 
to 
CHMP stated that a pivotal study based on 52 weeks on Ps population could be acceptable. However, 
the CHMP considered the PS study as not sufficient as standalone to support biosimilarity and it would 
have  preferred  to  have  the  12  month  data  from  the  RA  study  as  pivotal  or  in  support  of  Ps  data. 
Moreover,  the  preferred  primary  endpoints  by  CHMP  were  PASI  variable  analyzed  as  a  continuous 
outcome in Ps study and ACR20 in RA study.  
The  MAA  is  based  on  a  52  weeks  study  on  Ps  in  which  the  primary  endpoint  is  PASI  percent 
improvement at week 16 and on a 6 months RA study in which the primary endpoint is ACR20.   
Advice was also given on the adequacy of analytical and pharmacological comparability between ABP-
501 and Humira, including possible differences in structural characteristics along with in vitro studies 
(potency assay, FcRn Binding, FcyRIIIa, ADCC- and CDC activity) and ex-vivo pharmacological tests, 
which were selected to evaluate the binding, neutralizing, specificity and effector functionality of ABP 
501. Among the in vitro studies submitted by the Applicant, binding to FcyRs isoforms FcyRIIB and 
FcyRIIIB as well as binding to complement (Cq1) were not taken into consideration. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
AMGEVITA, referred to as ABP 501, has been developed as a biosimilar candidate to Humira 
(adalimumab). ABP 501 is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG1 that specifically binds to 
human tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological 
responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules 
responsible for leucocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1). 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 12/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ABP 501 also binds Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) and induces both antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro.  
The amino acid sequence of ABP 501 is identical to that of the reference product, adalimumab. The 
ABP 501 and adalimumab active ingredients are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology in 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. ABP 501 has the same dosage form and strength as adalimumab. 
AMGEVITA is presented as solution for subcutaneous injection and two strengths are proposed: 
- 20 mg in a single-dose pre-filled syringe (PFS), each containing 20 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 mL (50 
mg/mL) solution; 
- 40 mg in a single-dose pre-filled syringe or single-dose pre-filled pen (PFP) (SureClick, each 
containing 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.8 mL (50 mg/mL) solution. 
Adalimumab is formulated with glacial acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide and 
water for injections. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
ABP 501 is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass expressed in 
the CHO cell line and consists of 2 heavy chains (HC), and 2 light chains (LC) of the kappa subclass. 
ABP 501 contains 32 total cysteine residues involved in both intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds. 
Each HC contains 451 amino acids with 4 intrachain disulfides. Each LC contains 214 amino acids with 
2 intrachain disulfides. Each HC contains an N-linked glycan at the consensus glycosylation site on 
Asn301. As is typical with mammalian cell culture processes, the HC C-terminal Lys451 is mostly 
removed due to the presence of carboxypeptidases during the cell culture process. 
The molecular formula for the predominant ABP 501 HC isoform (C-terminal glycine) is 
C2191H3392N582O677S15, not including N-linked glycans. The molecular formula for ABP 501 LC is 
C1027H1610N282O332S6. The theoretical mass of fully assembled, disulfide-bonded ABP 501 antibody 
with HC C-terminal glycine and without the addition of the N-linked glycans is 145,192 Da. The 
predominant glycan moiety, A2G0F, has an empirical formula of C56H92N4O39 and has an empirical 
mass of 1,445 Da. Thus, the theoretical mass of glycosylated ABP 501 containing 2 N-linked glycans (1 
per heavy chain) is 148,081 Da. The experimentally determined predominant ABP 501 mass is 
148,083 Da, in agreement with the theoretical value. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Amgen Thousand Oaks (ATO), USA, is responsible for active substance manufacture. 
The ABP 501 clonal production cell line was generated at Amgen. The ABP 501 amino acid sequence 
was derived from a commercial lot of Humira (adalimumab). The deduced DNA sequence was 
synthesised for the heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable regions, and the variable region 
DNA was used to construct the ABP 501 HC and LC expression plasmids in a stepwise manner. 
The host cell line used for expression of ABP 501 is a serum-free CHO cell line. This cell line was 
derived by gradually adapting the CHO cell line to grow in serum-free medium. 
The HC and LC expression plasmids were co-transfected into CHO cells. Following a clone screening 
and selection process, final clone 11-1-300-23 was selected as the ABP 501 production cell line.  
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 13/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A two-tiered cell banking system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB) 
was established. The cell banks were characterised in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
A single production lot is initiated from a single WCB vial thaw. The manufacturing process for the 
active substance includes steps for cell culture, harvest, purification with a series of chromatography, 
viral inactivation/filtration and ultra-/diafiltration steps.  
The container closure system for drug substance is a 10 L polycarbonate container with a 
polypropylene screw thread cap and thermoplastic elastomer gasket. 
Reprocessing is not currently proposed during manufacturing of ABP 501 active substance. 
In-process controls (IPCs) are used to monitor the manufacturing process to ensure that the active 
substance and resulting finished product will meet quality requirements, or to monitor process 
consistency. IPCs are part of the control strategy. Justification of the IPC limits is provided. 
Control of materials 
a) Control of source and starting materials of biological origin: 
The Applicant’s viral safety program minimises the potential for introduction of adventitious virus into 
the ABP 501 manufacturing process through contaminated raw material and includes the following: 
- MCB and WCB have been extensively tested and found to be free of detectable adventitious agents; 
- Raw materials have appropriate certification, and no animal derived materials are used in the 
manufacturing process. 
An assessment of risk for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) transmission was performed 
on all raw materials from transfection of the cell line through fill and finish of the finished product. 
Materials not directly used in the process, but which may come into contact with the product during 
manufacturing or primary packaging, were also identified and assessed. 
Based on the complementary strategies of the viral safety program and adventitious agents safety 
evaluation results, Amgen concludes that the viral risk and TSE risk associated with this product are 
negligible. 
b) Raw materials: 
All manufacturing raw materials are received, identified, sampled, quarantined, tested, labeled, and 
released according to established written procedures. A listing of raw materials and process solutions, 
including cell culture media, stock solutions and buffers, used in the ABP 501 active substance 
manufacturing process was provided. Compendial materials are tested to the referenced compendia. 
Specifications are provided for all non-compendial materials and media solutions used in the process. 
c) Source, history and generation of cell substrate: 
The ABP 501 clonal production cell line was generated at Amgen. The source, history and generation of 
the cell substrate and cell line development was described.  
d) Genetic stability of the production cell line: 
The genetic stability for ABP 501 production has been assessed from thaw of the MCB through creation 
of the WCB to the end of production (EOP) for a typical active substance lot and also through the EOP 
to the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) for manufacturing. 
The LIVCA was determined by extending the population doublings from a typical EOP run during ABP 
501 manufacture at the commercial site and scale. The culture age is controlled to less than the LIVCA 
in the commercial manufacturing process through operational controls. 
Lot release data for the active substance generated from the LIVCA production culture confirmed that 
product quality at the defined LIVCA is consistent with results for other lots produced with lower 
population doubling levels.

Page 14/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results for the molecular characterisation of the integrated HC and LC genes demonstrate that the 
ABP 501 cell line is stable throughout the production process to the currently established LIVCA. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process was validated. Validation acceptance criteria for process 
parameters and performance indicators were based on reference product data, process understanding 
gained from prior knowledge, process characterisation and clinical manufacturing. Process validation 
was completed for cell culture, harvest, purification and in-process pool holds. Validation data 
demonstrate that the process is controlled and reproducible while consistently producing active 
substance having the required quality when conducted within the defined operating ranges. 
Manufacturing process development 
Minor changes to controls and processing conditions were implemented during development to ensure 
process robustness. Product quality assessments have demonstrated that the active substance 
produced throughout development is comparable. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure 
All elucidation of structure studies were conducted on an ABP 501 active substance lot.   
ABP 501 was characterised to provide a comprehensive understanding of its structural and functional 
properties and to support an assessment of criticality of product quality attributes (PQAs). ABP 501 
characterisation included the following studies:  
−  Biochemical studies to assess primary structure, glycosylation, disulfide structure, charge 
variants, and size variants; 
−  Biophysical studies to assess secondary structure, tertiary structure, and thermal stability; 
−  Biological studies to demonstrate the mechanism of action, including antigen specificity and Fc 
− 
functionality; 
Forced degradation studies to assess how ABP 501 responds to specific stress conditions to 
reveal potential degradation pathways under typical and atypical conditions and further 
understand PQAs. 
The in vitro biological activity of ABP 501 was studied using recombinant protein and cell-based binding 
and functional assays, assessing both antigen-specific functions and Fc-mediated functions. The 
characterisation methods were intended to assess (1) antigen binding, (2) potency with respect to the 
primary mechanism of action, and (3) Fc functionality. 
ABP 501 exerts its effects in autoimmune diseases primarily via binding to soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α) and 
the membrane-bound precursor form, transmembrane TNF-α (mbTNF-α). Additionally, ABP 501 binds 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) and mediates effector functions such as 
ADCC) and CDC in vitro. 
ABP 501  binds  human  and  non-human  primate  TNF-α  with  high  affinity,  but  does  not  bind  human 
lymphotoxin alpha (LTα).  
Impurities 
Based on comprehensive characterisation of ABP 501, the product-related impurities were identified. 
The product-related impurities were determined to have a potential impact on patient safety or product 
efficacy. The product-related impurities present are present at very low levels in the active substance 
and are controlled to acceptable levels by the manufacturing process.  The risk assessment and overall 
control strategy for each of these product-related impurities was presented. 
Process-related impurities encompass those derived from or introduced during the active substance 
manufacturing process. Included are impurities from the host cell line and raw materials used during 
cell culture and downstream processing.  
The removal of host cell proteins (HCP), DNA, and residual protein A in the active substance process 
was evaluated in commercial-scale runs. Removal of these impurities to predefined acceptance criteria

was demonstrated during challenge studies performed at small-scale during process characterisation 
and confirmed during process validation. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  covers  identity,  purity,  potency,  adventitious  agents  and  general 
tests. 
During the development of ABP 501, a number of analytical procedures were included on the clinical 
active substance specification that have been either removed from the specification due to additional 
product and process understanding and demonstrated process performance, or moved to in-process 
testing due to the presence of redundant testing points. 
The dataset used to calculate and establish the acceptance limits included release testing results from 
the active substance, as well as stability data from active substance lots held at the recommended 
storage conditions. Considerations for establishing the specification acceptance criteria also included: 
Formulation development studies; 
−  Process and product characterisation data; 
−  Manufacturing experience with similar monoclonal antibody processes; 
− 
−  Analytical method performance; 
−  Acceptable safety levels; 
−  World Health Organization (WHO), United States Pharmacopeia (USP), European 
Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  
Active substance lot release results with numerical limits are routinely tracked as part of a data 
monitoring program. The monitoring program establishes statistically derived control limits per internal 
procedures that are more stringent than the lot release and stability acceptance limits.  This additional 
control provides early visibility to potentially adverse product quality trends that may be observed 
during manufacturing and/or stability and ensures a timely response and quality investigations. This 
program helps to ensure that all active substance lots will meet the expected quality profile and 
specified acceptance limits during release testing and throughout the shelf life. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data were provided for all ABP 501 active substance lots used during development 
through process validation. A comparison of product quality results between clinical and commercial 
active substance lots was provided. 
Reference material 
A primary reference standard has been used for lot release testing of all active substance and finished 
product lots manufactured to date and used for the analytical similarity assessment. The primary 
reference standard will be used to qualify future reference standards which will be created, as needed, 
to ensure sufficient supply for release and stability testing.  The primary reference standard was 
qualified. 
Stability 
Based on stability data collected to date, an expiry period is supported for ABP 501 active substance 
stored at the recommended storage temperature. Stability studies were conducted at the 
recommended storage temperature to support the expiry period. The long-term stability studies were 
performed according to ICH Q5C guideline.  
Stability data at the accelerated storage conditions demonstrate the active substance remains stable 
under accelerated conditions. Stability data at the stressed storage condition demonstrate that the 
active substance remains stable under stressed conditions.

sufficient to target pH 5.2 and water for injections. 
The nature and contents of container consist of: 
- 0.4 mL or 0.8 mL solution in PFS (type I glass) with a plunger stopper (bromobutyl rubber) and a 
stainless steel needle (27-gauge [27G] or 29-gauge [29G]) with a needle shield (thermoplastic 
elastomer).  
- 0.8 mL solution for injection in PFP for patient use containing a PFS (type I glass). The pen is a single 
use, disposable, handheld, mechanical injection device.

The active substance and finished product have an identical formulation. The formulation is not 
modified during finished product manufacturing. 
The excipients were chosen to ensure active substance and finished product stability. Active substance 
and finished product stability data confirm the compatibility of ABP 501 with the excipients. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
There are no formula overages in ABP 501 finished product. Syringes are filled to ensure that there is a 
sufficient deliverable volume provided from each syringe. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product has the same formulation and concentration as the active substance. Therefore, 
no dilution is required for finished product manufacturing and the concentrations of active and 
excipients remain the same. 
Reprocessing is not currently proposed during manufacturing of ABP 501 finished product.  
IPCs are used to ensure process consistency and product quality during the manufacture of the PFS. 
The critical IPCs for the finished product manufacturing process are included in the process flow 
diagram of the finished product manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing controls have been established to ensure appropriate assembly of the auto-injector. The 
assembly process has been demonstrated to have no adverse impact to product quality. 
The ABP 501 finished product process validation strategy was designed to demonstrate that the 
manufacturing process is controlled and reproducible, consistently yielding finished product with the 
required product quality. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specification includes identity, purity, potency and other general tests. 
Batch analyses 
Batch  analyses  data  were  provided  for  all  ABP  501  finished  product  lots  using  during  development 
through process validation. 
Stability of the product 
Based on stability data collected to date, in accordance with ICH Q5C guideline, a shelf life of 24 
months is acceptable for the finished product stored at the recommended storage condition of 2°C to 
8°C. Additionally, to enhance convenience and facilitate dosing, storage for 14 days up to 25°C is 
proposed and accepted.  
Stability studies conducted at accelerated storage conditions (25°C and 30°C) demonstrated that the 
finished product remains stable under accelerated conditions for 1 month. Stability data at the stressed 
storage conditions (40°C) demonstrated that the finished product remains stable at the stressed 
conditions for 1 week.   
Stability of the finished product after exposure to light, temperature cycling, typical transport 
conditions, and room temperature at end of shelf life have also been evaluated. Results of these 
studies, together with results from the accelerated and stressed stability studies, demonstrate that the 
finished product is stable in the primary container, protected from light, under conditions that may be 
encountered during transport, storage, handling, and use. Results have also been presented 
demonstrating that the secondary packaging effectively protects the finished product from light 
exposure.

Adventitious agents 
Non-viral Adventitious Agents  
The ABP 501 manufacturing process incorporates control measures to prevent contamination and 
maintain microbial control.  
An assessment of risk for TSE transmission was performed on all raw materials used to produce ABP 
501, from the transfection of the cell line through fill and finish of the finished product.  
The ABP 501 manufacturing process does not use excipients, cell culture media components, or 
purification resins of animal origin. 
In addition, materials not directly used in the process, but which may come into contact with the 
product during manufacture or primary packaging, were identified and assessed for BSE/TSE 
transmission risk. For those materials manufactured using animal tallow derivatives, the processing 
conditions meet the "rigorous processes" criteria defined in EMA 410/01 TSE guideline.  
It is considered that the TSE risk associated with ABP 501 is negligible. 
Viral Adventitious Agents  
Adventitious Agents Testing of Cell banks 
The MCB, WCB and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) have been tested as recommended in 
the relevant ICH guideline. Testing results confirmed that the cell banks are sterile and free of 
detectable mycoplasma or viruses, with the exception of expected A-type and C-type retrovirus-like 
particles (RVLP). No bovine or porcine viruses were detected in any of the cell banks tested.  
Process Viral Clearance Assessment 
Five steps of the ABP 501 manufacturing process were evaluated for their ability to remove or 
inactivate model viruses 
Viral validation studies were carried out in accordance with ICH Q5A guideline. 
Where applicable, the evaluated steps were scaled down from the commercial purification process. 
Scale-down included the use of process intermediates obtained from development or clinical batches 
manufactured by the intended commercial process and scale. Process buffers and solutions were 
prepared in accordance with the commercial process. In addition, processing conditions were 
maintained between scales. 
Comparisons of the relevant process parameters and performance indicators between small-scale 
model and commercial process have been provided in tabular format. The results presented indicate 
that performance was comparable to the commercial-scale production runs.  
The chromatography steps were evaluated with both new and used (cycled) resins to demonstrate that 
the viral clearance capacity does not change for a given column over the lifetime of the resin. Used 
resins were generated during the execution of small-scale chromatography lifetime studies. Upon 
completion of the resin lifetime studies, used resins (were re-slurried and packed into individual 
columns for the virus challenge studies for comparison to new resin. 
Four model viruses were used in viral validation studies. 
Comparability exercise for the finished medicinal product 
ABP 501 has been developed as a biosimilar product to the reference product Humira (adalimumab 
[EU]) (EMEA/H/C/000481). The Applicant performed a comprehensive analytical similarity assessment 
using state-of-the-art methods and has determined that: 
- ABP 501 is analytically similar to the reference product; 
- ABP 501 has the same primary amino acid sequence as the reference product; 
- ABP 501 has the same strength as the reference product. 
The ABP 501 clinical program includes 3 studies to support the application (Table 1). Amgen used both 
US-sourced Humira (adalimumab [US]) (BLA 125057) and EU-sourced Humira (adalimumab [EU]) in 
the clinical program.

Table 1 – ABP 501 clinical studies 
To support the use of clinical data generated using adalimumab sourced from both regions, Amgen has 
established a scientific bridge between adalimumab (US) and adalimumab (EU), which is based on 3-
pair wise analytical and PK comparisons. To complete the analytical comparisons, all 3 products were 
subjected to the same testing plan. Thus, the analytical similarity assessment consists of 3-pair wise 
comparisons (Table 2). 
Table 2 – Definitions for analytical similarity pair-wise comparisons 
The methods used for the analytical similarity assessment were selected based on knowledge 
regarding the structure, function, and heterogeneity of the reference product and ABP 501, including 
those characteristics critical to the biological activity and stability of the product. The Applicant 
performed a comprehensive analytical similarity assessment which included comparative evaluations of 
biological activities, primary structure, higher order structure, particles and aggregates, product-
related substances and impurities, thermal stability and degradation studies, general properties, and 
process-related impurities. The methods were validated or qualified and deemed suitable for their 
intended use.  
To inform analytical similarity assessment, data for similarity assays/attributes that have the potential 
to impact clinical outcomes were evaluated against similarity assessment criteria. In instances where 
the data did not meet the assessment criteria, the differences were justified with regards to its 
potential to impact clinical outcomes. 
The results demonstrate that: 
−  ABP 501 has similar biological activity compared to the reference product. 
−  ABP 501 has the same amino acid sequence and similar structure compared to the reference 
product. 
−  ABP 501 has similar strength compared to the reference product.

−  ABP 501 has a similar glycan map profile compared to the reference product, with minor 
quantitative differences. These minor differences are not considered meaningful. 
−  ABP 501 has a similar profile for size variants compared to the reference product.   
−  ABP 501 has a similar profile for charge variants compared to the reference product.  
−  ABP 501 has a similar particle profile compared to the reference product.  
−  ABP 501 has a similar thermal degradation profile compared to the reference product. 
−  ABP 501 has similar general properties compared to the reference products. 
−  ABP 501 does not have any significant differences in process-related impurities compared to the 
reference product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
The  information  requested  to  support  adequate  control  of  viral  safety  has  been  provided,  the 
characterisation  for  qualification  of  the  MCB,  WCB  and  end-of-production  (EOP)  cells  is  concluded 
acceptable. 
The  descriptions  of  the  different  manufacturing  steps  are  considered  acceptable.  As  requested, 
supplementary  documentation  has  been  provided  supporting  adequate  control  of  elution  of  product 
from the chromatography steps. As previously requested, the Applicant also  confirmed that operation 
of  any  of  the  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  outside  the  defined  acceptable  range  will  trigger  the 
same investigations as is described for action limits controlling IPC tests. 
An  acceptable  justification  has  been  provided  for  not  including  analyses  of  the  primary  and  higher 
order structures in the studies conducted supporting comparability of active substance before and after 
introduction of optimised control of the production bioreactor step. 
In primary assessment, the proposed integrated control strategy was considered insufficient to assure 
that  the  commercial  active  substance  is  of  the  appropriate  quality  (Major  Objection).  Indeed,  control 
strategy as initially proposed seemed to allow a large degree of process flexibility without an adequate 
testing  of  relevant  product  quality  attributes  at  release  (or  in-process)  to  assure  consistency  of 
commercial  lots.  Comprehensive  supportive  documentation  has  been  provided  in  the  Applicant’s 
response,  including  for  example  the  introduction  of  new  IPC  tests  as  well  as  the  tightening  of  action 
limits/specifications  for  tests  applied  for  in  process  and  release  control  of  relevant  product  quality 
attributes to assure consistency of commercial lots. The overall control strategy applied in production is 
considered satisfactorily supported.  
The specification for control of active substance is only limited. However, in-process tests for control of 
purity  are  indicated  at  different  steps  in  the  downstream  process.  Their  designation  as  IPC  tests  in 
production  of  active  substance  is  considered  acceptable  as  the  same  tests  are  controlled  by 
specifications for finished product. The action/rejection criteria proposed for these tests were however 
considered to be set too wide but were tightened to ensure that the finished product will comply with 
the end-of-shelf-life specifications. 
Similarly, tests for control of general properties are indicated as IPC tests. As the Applicant has agreed 
to follow the recommendations given in the primary assessment on the control of these parameters on 
the level of finished product, this is considered acceptable. 
The  upper  limit  proposed  for  specification  hat  were  considered  to  be  set  too  wide  to  assure  that  the 
ADCC activity of commercial ABP501 finished product will remain within the range that has been shown 
to be safe and efficacious has now been tightened and acceptably justified.

Taken  together,  the  stability  data  included  in  the  primary  submission  and  submitted  response,  are 
considered  acceptable  to  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  for  active  substance  of  48  months,  when 
stored at the recommended storage temperature. 
Finished product 
Relevant  tests  are  included  in  the  release  specification  for  the  finished  product.  The  specification  was 
revised in accordance with CHMP request. 
Updated stability data were provided during the review, including up to 36 months data from primary 
and  supportive  stability  lots  in  the  statistical  evaluation  of  data,  giving  satisfactory  support  that 
finished  product  remains  within  the  proposed  stability  specification.  The  statistical  evaluation  of  the 
extended stability data was conducted in line with the recommendations in the ICH Q1E guideline.   
As  requested,  the  Applicant  re-evaluated  and  tightened  the  finished  product  end-of-shelf-life-
specification for acidic species in order to assure that acidic species remain within the range that can 
be considered clinically qualified. In relation to this issue, the Applicant also reduced the shelf life from 
36 to 24 months. This is acceptable 
The maximum of 14 days hold time at up to 25°C and protected from light, within the 24 months shelf 
life of the finished product, is acceptable as the worst case conditions tested give enough assurance of 
the requested stability.   
The information provided regarding adventitious agents safety has been revised in accordance with the 
request by CHMP and is considered acceptable.    
Biosimilarity exercise 
The  design  of  the  biosimilarity  studies  is  considered  acceptable,  including  with  a  few  exceptions 
relevant  analytical  methods  for  assessment  of  comparability  in  the  structure,  function  and 
heterogeneity of ABP 501 and reference product. The concerns raised on whether the ADCC and CDC 
bioassays  where  sufficiently  sensitive  to  detect  differences  related  to  variability  in  the  levels  of  high 
mannose  and  the  galactosylation  profile,  have  been  satisfactorily  addressed,  showing  adequate 
performance of both analytical procedures. 
In  most  aspects,  the  approaches  used  for  establishment  of  the  biosimilarity  assessment  criteria  are 
considered acceptable. However, no discussion or justification was presented supporting the proposed 
definition  of  acceptance  criteria  for  statistical  evaluation  of  data.  According  to  the  proposed  criteria, 
conclusion  on  comparability  will  be  made  if  >  90  %  of  individual  batches  of  biosimilar  product  fall 
within the calculated range of mean + 3 Standard Deviations (SD) for reference product, which leads 
to acceptance of a too wide range in product quality. However, as data from the analysis of individual 
batches are provided for all analyses where results have been statistically evaluated, assessment can 
be made independent of the statistical model used. 
For assays/attributes where a change over time is observed when stored at the recommended storage 
condition, all values were adjusted for material age prior to computing the quality range. Even though 
this  approach  was  considered  theoretically  sound,  it  was  pointed  out  that  this  could  introduce  a  bias 
instead  of  a  correct  age-adjustment.  The  Applicant  gave  satisfactory  reassurance  of  the  reliability  of 
the comparison of data.  
The  ABP  501  product  batches  included  in  the  biosimilarity  assessment  were  not  considered 
representative  for  commercial  production,  as  the  proposed  specifications  opened  for  a  considerably 
wider range in quality of commercial finished product than those studied in the comparative analysis. 
In  response  to  the  raised  concern,  the  specifications  for  control  finished  product  purity  have  been 
tightened. The limits have now been satisfactorily revised and justified. 
Taken together, the data presented is considered acceptable to show that there are no significant 
qualitative or quantitative differences between reference and biosimilar product at end of storage 
besides those that can be attributed to differences in the levels of C-terminal lysine.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of AMGEVITA is considered to be in line with the quality of other monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have 
been sufficiently assured. 
Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Humira has been sufficiently demonstrated. From a 
quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been well 
documented and are acceptable. 
The overall quality of AMGEVITA is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical program is in line with the recommendations in the Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). For some aspects (in vivo toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys), the program goes beyond these recommendations, but these studies were primarily 
conducted in order to fulfil requirements in other regions. The toxicology and toxicokinetics studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys were conducted in accordance with GLP. 
In a CHMP Scientific Advice, given in 2011, an outline of the in vitro biological assay strategy was 
generally agreed. 
The nonclinical program was designed to assess pharmacological activity, PK, and toxicological 
characteristics of ABP 501 as part of the stepwise assessment of similarity. To support a “global” 
development programme, an analytical comparability exercise was performed by Amgen on batches of 
“adalimumab (US) and “adalimumab (EU)”, approach considered acceptable by EMA (Scientific Advice 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/868010/2011, procedure no EMEA/H/SA/2216/1/2011/III), provided that a sufficient 
number of EU reference product batches were included. Advice was given on the adequacy of analytical 
and pharmacological comparability between ABP-501 and Humira, including possible differences in 
structural characteristics along with in vitro studies (potency assay, FcRn Binding, FcyRIIIa, ADCC- and 
CDC activity) and ex-vivo pharmacological tests selected to evaluate the binding, neutralizing, 
specificity and effector functionality of ABP 501. The SA also dealt with the non-clinical PK and 
Toxicology program consisting of a 4-week non-human primate toxicology study, which was designed 
in order to fulfil US-FDA requirements and therefore designed to examine the differences in 
formulation between Humira (US) and ABP 501. Although it was submitted by the Applicant in the 
present MAA, such a study is not required for marketing authorization in the EU.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary Functional Assays for Potency  
For the biosimilarity evaluation, a number of in vitro pharmacological assays have been performed 
where ABP 501 has been compared to commercially available adalimumab (Humira) from both EU and 
US. A limited number of methods have been selected for more extensive comparisons: 
• 
Inhibition of sTNFα-induced apoptosis in U937 cells 
•  Binding to sTNFα 
•  Binding to FcγRIIIa(158V) 
•  Binding to FcRn 
•  Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
•  Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
These evaluations have been performed with assays that are expected to show a good ability to detect 
differences of possible clinical relevance, and have been performed with a large number of lots of each 
product (≥10) in order to address variability. See Quality section of the report for a full assessment of 
these data. The results from the above mentioned studies are considered as the pivotal data set for 
the similarity evaluation.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted in line with relevant guidelines including 
the CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been submitted in line with relevant guidelines including the 
CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted in line with relevant guidelines 
including the CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A toxicokinetic evaluation was performed as part of a repeat dose toxicity program in cynomolgus 
monkeys, please see toxicology section below. There was no meaningful difference in TK parameters 
between animals dosed with ABP 501 and adalimumab (US). 
Distribution 
No distribution studies were submitted in line with the CHMP guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing monoclonal antibodies (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Metabolism  
No metabolism studies have been conducted with adalimumab. These are not considered relevant for a 
therapeutic  protein  because  the  expected  consequence  of  metabolism  is  the  normal  catabolic

degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. As such, classical biotransformation studies 
performed for small molecules are not warranted per current regulatory guidance (ICH S6). 
Excretion 
No  excretion  studies  have  been  conducted  with  ABP  501;  no  specific  studies  were  undertaken  to 
evaluate the excretion of ABP 501 in breast milk either. However, all immunoglobulin G subclasses can 
be transferred into the milk of lactating animals, has been reported into the literature; in light of this 
evidence, it can be deducted that ABP 501 is excreted in lactation fluid. 
Drug-drug Interactions  
No non-clinical or clinical dedicated drug-drug interactions studies were conducted, in order to assess 
the effect of concomitant drugs on ABP 501 PK which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
According  to  the  CHMP/EMA  guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  monoclonal 
antibodies  (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010),  the  conduct  of  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  non-
human primates is not recommended for biosimilar products (this is also in line with Scientific Advice 
provided).  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Two one month comparative repeat dose toxicity studies with weekly SC dosing were performed in 
cynomolgus monkeys with ABP 501 and adalimumab (US).  
The first was interrupted after two doses and only limited toxicity information was acquired in this 
study. In the second study, monkeys were dosed SC with 157 mg/kg ABP 501, adalimumab or vehicle. 
The dose was similar to the highest dose in the Humira development program.

(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005). 
Local Tolerance  
Histologic examination of the SC injection site was performed as part of the 1-month toxicology study 
in monkeys.  Effects at the SC injection site (focal fibroplasia/fibrosis and focal mononuclear or mixed 
cell infiltrates) were considered secondary to the injection procedure since they are commonly 
observed at injection sites and were noted at a similarly low incidence in vehicle control, ABP 501, and 
adalimumab (US) groups.  Although ABP 501 and adalimumab (US) have different formulations, there 
was no apparent difference in local tolerance between the two drug products. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant provided a justification for not submitting any environmental risk assessment studies 
based on the fact that AMGEVITA is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the 
environment which is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
For the in vitro biological biosimilarity evaluation a limited number of methods for more extensive 
comparisons were submitted. These studies are assessed in the Quality section of the report. These 
methods are considered to contain all the important elements for the biosimilarity evaluation and are 
considered pivotal for this purpose. 
Additional studies were performed with less stringently characterized methods and with no more than 
3 lots from each product.  
No differences in activity between ABP 501 and adalimumab (EU) or adalimumab (US) could be 
detected in any of these assays. 
It is clear that a number of these assays are of limited quantitative strength and would only detect 
large differences. The cellular assays and whole blood assays presented in this section are in most 
cases of such nature. The MLR assay is stated to give only qualitative information. For other cellular 
assays, although variable origin of cells or blood resulted in assay variability, a consistent and similar 
activity of the different adalimumab lots was shown.  
In addition to the functionally most important Fc receptor types (FcRn and FCRIIIa), other members of 
the Fc receptor class were studied in this section. These assays were performed with similar 
methodology as the pivotal assays. Although a limited number of lots were tested in these assays, 
similarity was consistently shown. 
An assay program covering a broad spectrum of both TNFα and IgG related biological activities did not 
reveal any differences that could be of biological importance. 
A toxicokinetic evaluation was performed as part of a repeat dose toxicity program in cynomolgus 
monkeys. There was no meaningful difference in TK parameters between animals dosed with ABP 501 
and adalimumab (US). This study showed similar pharmacodynamic lymphoid changes for ABP 501 
and adalimumab (US), characterized by mild to moderate decreased size and number of germinal 
centers in lymph nodes. No unexpected toxicities were observed with ABP 501. While supportive for 
the biosimilarity evaluation, more weight is put on the human PK data. 
In the EU guideline on biosimilar monoclonal antibodies, it is pointed out that non-human primate 
toxicity studies are considered of limited value for biosimilarity evaluation and such studies are not 
generally recommended. The small format of these studies lacks any power to detect differences of 
potential clinical importance. It is however acknowledged that these studies were performed to fulfil 
the requirements in other regions. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Comparative pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data demonstrated biosimilarity 
between AMGEVITA and the reference product Humira. The provided non-clinical comparability 
exercise testing strategy was considered as appropriate. Relevant regulatory guidelines were taken 
into consideration.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Three trials have been submitted in order to demonstrate pharmacokinetic biosimilarity:  
•  Study 20110217 which was a single-dose phase 1, 3-way pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity 
study in healthy men and women comparing ABP 501 with adalimumab (EU) and adalimumab 
(US) 
•  2 randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled phase 3 studies including comparison 
of trough serum concentrations (sparse sampling):  
o  Study 20120262 in adult subjects with moderate to severe RA comparing ABP 501 with 
adalimumab (US) 
o  Study 20120263 in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis comparing ABP 501 with 
adalimumab (EU)  
Pharmacokinetic Study 20110217 
The study was a randomised, 3-arm, single-blind, single-dose parallel group study in healthy adult 
male and female subjects. Each subject received a single 40-mg (0.8 ml) subcutaneous dose of ABP 
501, adalimumab (US), or adalimumab (EU) 50 mg/ml solution for injection in a pre-filler syringe (40 
mg/0.8 ml) in the morning of day 1 following a light break-fast. Blood-samples for analysis of active 
substance were taken pre-dose and 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 240, 312, 360, 
504, 672, 840, 1008, 1176, 1344 and 1488 hours after drug administration. Blood samples for analysis 
of antibodies capable of binding adalimumab were taken pre-dose and day 16, 29 and 63. A total of 
203 adult healthy male (116) and female (87) volunteers aged 18-45 years were enrolled. There were 
7 subjects who prematurely discontinued the study and thus 196 subjects (96.6%) completed the 
study. 
The mean serum concentration-time profiles were similar following a single SC injection of all 3 
treatments over the entire course of sampling.  
The results are presented below.

The extrapolated AUC was less than 20% in most subjects. No pre-dose concentrations were detected 
and no subjects reached tmax at the first sampling point. 
Overall exposure was approximately 20% to 30% lower for all 3 treatments in ADA-positive subjects 
compared to ADA-negative subjects, and consistent with the lower exposure was the shorter t½ in 
ADA-positive subjects. On average, the t½ was 6 to 7 days in the ADA-positive subjects compared to 
12 to 15 days in those subjects who were ADA negative. When comparing ABP 501 to adalimumab 
(EU) in subjects classified as ADA negative, the 90% CIs of the ratios of geometric means were fully 
contained within 0.80 to 1.25.

Table 7 - Summary of statistical assessment of ABP 501, Adalimumab (US) and Adalimumab (EU) 
pharmacokinetic parameters adjusted by protein content factor 
All samples were tested for binding antibodies against the three different sources of adalimumab (ABP 
501, adalimumab (US) and adalimumab (EU)). The three assays performed similarly for all samples, 
indicating that the anti-adalimumab antibodies are not specific for one source of adalimumab. 
The binding antibody incidence by treatment was similar for ABP 501 (54%) and adalimumab (US) 
(55%).  The incidence for subjects treated with a single dose of adalimumab (EU) was higher (67%). 
Neutralizing activity was tested only against ABP 501, as the binding antibody assay demonstrated the 
detected ADAs had equivalent binding capability to ABP 501 and adalimumab (US and EU).  The 
neutralizing antibody incidence by treatment during the study was similar for ABP 501 (18%), 
adalimumab (US) (22%), and adalimumab (EU) (21%).

Phase 3 study 20120263 (psoriasis) 
The study is described in the Clinical Efficacy section below. The pharmacokinetic results are 
summarised in this section.  
From baseline to week 16, the geometric mean trough serum concentrations were considered to be 
similar between Treatment Group A (ABP 501) and Treatment Group B (adalimumab) since no notable 
difference in mean geometric ratios were observed. From baseline to the end of study, the geometric 
mean trough serum concentrations were considered to be similar between all re-randomized treatment 
groups across the various assessed time-points since no notable difference in geometric mean ratios 
was observed between any of the treatment groups.

The study is described in the Clinical Efficacy section further below. The pharmacokinetic results are 
summarised in this section. Pharmacokinetic results revealed that trough serum concentrations, the 
geometric mean, and the geometric coefficient of variability were similar between the ABP 501 and 
adalimumab groups across all study weeks, indicating that investigational product exposure was 
similar between treatment groups in this subject population.

Comparison between PK data in healthy volunteers and in patients 
Due to differences in dosing (single dose versus multiple doses) between the PK similarity study 
(Study 20110217) and the 2 phase 3 studies (Study 20120262 and Study 20120263), direct 
comparison between single-dose PK from healthy subjects with multiple-dose trough concentrations 
from phase 3 studies are not relevant.  Instead, the simulated trough serum concentrations of ABP 501 
or adalimumab in healthy subjects at steady state following 40-mg SC Q2W dosing were estimated for 
comparison with the corresponding trough serum concentrations observed in the phase 3 studies 
(Study 20120262 in subjects with RA and Study 20120263 in subjects with Ps).  Simulated values 
were calculated using the principle of superposition. The trough concentrations derived from the 
ABP 501 study in healthy subjects are highly consistent with those observed from the ABP 501 studies 
in RA and Ps subjects as well as between ABP 501 and adalimumab, indicating consistency in PK of 
ABP 501 (and comparability with adalimumab) across the 3 populations studied.

Special populations 
No studies were performed in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients with renal impairment 
as these are not required for a similar biological medicinal product.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK interaction studies were performed as these are not required for a similar biological medicinal 
product.    
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Specific pharmacodynamic (PD) markers considered relevant to predicting efficacy of adalimumab in 
patients do not exist, although clinical endpoints that reflect the efficacy of treatment for all conditions 
of use for which adalimumab is indicated are well defined and accepted. Therefore, no PD markers 
were incorporated into the ABP 501 PK study, and clinical endpoints were utilized in the phase 3 
studies in subjects with moderate to severe RA (Study 20120262) and Psoriasis (Study 20120263). 
In accordance with EU guidance (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/ 42832/2005; EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), 
clinical evidence for comparability/similarity can be demonstrated by PD surrogate endpoints or clinical 
evidence. In case of AMGEVITA, clinical evidence for similarity was aimed to be demonstrated by 
clinical rather than PD endpoints. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The study design of the pharmacokinetic study (study 20110217) is satisfactory and was accepted in 
the CHMP advice. A parallel design is acceptable considering the long half-life of adalimumab 
(approximately 2 weeks) and the potential influence of immunogenicity. The use of healthy volunteers 
is agreed in line with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 45/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues. The treatment groups were similar in age, ethnicity and 
BMI. Supportive PK data from the phase 3 studies in patients are also available in line with guideline 
recommendations. The 40 mg SC dose is the normally recommended dose (although higher initial 
doses are given for some indications) and the use of this dose is endorsed. Blood samples for analysis 
of antidrug antibodies were taken when there are still remaining drug concentrations in the blood, but 
the ADA assay methods used were assessed for tolerance in presence of drug.  
Analysis with correction for protein content was the primary comparison according to the initial 
statistical analysis plan, but this was revised in a late amendment and instead the unadjusted PK 
parameters were used for the primary analysis.  
For therapeutic proteins there is no firm guidance on content correction. This topic is addressed by 
EMA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) reporting: “Correction for protein content may 
be acceptable on a case-by-case basis if pre-specified and adequately justified, with the results from 
the assay of the test and reference products being included in the protocol”. The difference in protein 
content was large when comparing the batch used as test product (95.8%) and the batch used as EU-
sourced reference product (106.6%). Thus, it is considered relevant to compare protein-adjusted data. 
For unadjusted AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and 
reference products fell within the pre-specified acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when comparing 
ABP 501 to the reference product from EU as well as from US and the 90% confidence intervals 
included 1. Both comparisons are important since the RA study was performed using US reference 
product. Also when comparing the US versus the EU reference products the results fell within the pre-
specified acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for all three parameters, although the confidence 
interval for Cmax did not include 1.  
For the protein content adjusted Cmax and AUClast the 90% CI fall within 0.80-1.25 and include 1. Tmax 
and t½ was similar for all three formulations. However, for AUCinf the 90% CI falls outside the 0.80 – 
1.25 limits and is statistically higher than both US and EU adalimumab (point estimate 16%).  
A higher exposure of ABP 501 compared to the reference product was observed based on the primary 
parameter AUCinf adjusted for protein content (point estimate 16%), which may indicate a difference in 
clearance and/or relative bioavailability. Since the difference in protein content was large (95.8% for 
test product compared to 106.6% for EU reference product) it is considered relevant to compare 
protein-adjusted data. Therefore the Applicant provided an extensive discussion to support the claim of 
PK similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab. The reason why the protein content adjusted 90% CI 
of AUCinf fell outside the BE margin is likely due to shortcomings in the study design, specifically the 
duration of PK plasma sampling was somewhat short. This resulted in exclusion of a relatively large 
proportion (13.3%) of the non-compartmental analysis (NCA) derived AUCinf values, mostly due to a 
large extrapolated area (>20%). The exclusion led to increased imprecision in the comparison between 
the products with respect to AUCinf. As a consequence biosimilarity was not concluded. To further 
investigate these results the Applicant employed a modelling approach using population PK analysis 
and it could be concluded that the current model provides an acceptable description of data and can be 
used for generating AUCinf values for all subjects. Statistical testing was not explicitly made in the 
model; rather, by modelling it was possible to generate individual predicted AUCinf values for all 
subjects including the previously excluded subjects. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio of these 
AUCinf values (ABP 501 vs adalimumab EU) was 0.98 to 1.23 (point estimate 1.10) which is similar to 
the CI for AUClast using NCA evaluation (0.99-1.22, point estimate 1.10), i.e. indicating that if all 
subjects are included, the protein adjusted AUCinf is comparable between the products. The Applicant 
has provided additional supportive evidence from a population PK model that protein adjusted AUCinf is 
comparable between ABP 501 and reference adalimumab. The updated pop PK model supports the 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 46/120 
 
 
 
 
 
explanation that the observed difference in AUCinf is caused by exclusion of data. Based on the totality 
of PK data, PK similarity can be concluded.  
The sensitivity analysis with antidrug antibody negative subjects was within the pre-specified 
acceptance range for the comparison between ABP 501 and the EU reference product. It is clear that 
half-life and exposure is lower in subjects positive for antidrug antibodies compared to subjects 
negative for antidrug antibodies. 
The results indicate a higher formation of binding anti-drug antibodies for adalimumab (EU) and similar 
formation of binding anti-drug antibodies for ABP 501 and adalimumab (US). According to the 
Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and 
clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) a lower immunogenicity for the biosimilar would not 
preclude biosimilarity. 
For study 20120263 it is agreed that trough serum concentrations were similar between ABP 501 and 
adalimumab (EU) treatment groups since no notable difference in mean geometric ratios was observed 
and since the confidence intervals included 1. This supports similar exposure in this population. 
For study 20120262 it is agreed that trough serum concentrations were similar between ABP 501 and 
adalimumab (US) treatment groups. This supports similar exposure in this population. 
No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted as part of this application. This is considered 
acceptable for a biosimilar application. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has sufficiently explained and justified the difference in exposure (protein content 
adjusted AUCinf. Pharmacokinetic similarity has been sufficiently demonstrated between ABP 501 and 
the reference product). Thus biosimilarity can be concluded from a clinical pharmacology perspective 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies were submitted. The selection of dose and dosing regimen for testing in 
Study 20120263 and Study 20120262 was based on that used in the approved indication of Ps and RA 
for Humira (80 mg SC initial loading dose followed by 40 mg SC every other week starting 1 week 
after the initial dose for Ps and 40 mg SC every other week for RA). The dosing regimen proposed for 
ABP 501 in adults with Ps as well as RA would be the same as that approved for Humira.

target population. However, subjects were allowed to have been treated with a single previous 
biological agent (different to Humira or biosimilar of Humira). 
Treatments 
Objectives 
The primary objective for this study was to assess the efficacy of ABP 501 compared with adalimumab.  
The secondary objectives were to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ABP 501 compared with 
adalimumab.  
The exploratory objectives were to assess injection site pain perception based on subject’s rankings for 
ABP 501 compared with adalimumab, and to assess trough serum concentration for ABP 501 compared 
with adalimumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the risk ratio (RR) of ACR20 at week 24.  
ACR20 
To achieve an ACR20 response, at least 20% improvement compared to baseline was required for both 
swollen and tender joint counts (66/68 joint counts) and for at least 3 of the following 5 additional 
parameters: 
•  Subject's Global Health Assessment (on a 0 to 10 horizontal scale) 
• 
• 
Investigator's Global Health Assessment (on a 0 to 10 horizontal scale) 
subject’s assessment of pain (on a 100-mm visual analogue scale [VAS]) 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 49/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (range: 0 to 3)  
• 
serum CRP concentration 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the change from baseline of the Disease Activity Score 28-CRP 
(DAS28-CRP) at each time point (weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24); the RR of ACR20 responses at weeks 
2 and 8; and the RR of ACR50 (50% improvement in ACR core set measurements) and ACR70 (70% 
improvement in ACR core set measurements) responses at week 24. 
DAS28-CRP 
The DAS28-CRP is a continuous scale based on 28 DAS joints from the ACR, the Subject's Global 
Health Assessment score (assessed as a score of 0 to 100 transformed from the results on a 0 to 10 
horizontal scale by multiplying the horizontal scale by 10), and CRP, as follows: DAS28-CRP = 
0.56*(TJC28)0.5 + 0.28*(SJC28)0.5 + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96, where TJC28 is the 
tender joint count of the 28 joints in the DAS; SJC28 is the 28 swollen joint count; CRP is in mg/L; and 
GH is the Subject's Global Health Assessment on a 0 to 100 scale. 
ACR50 and ACR70 
The ACR50 and ACR70 are defined in a similar fashion to the ACR20, but require at least 50% and 
70% improvement compared to baseline, respectively, for both swollen and tender joint counts, and 
for at least 3 out of 5 additional parameters (Subject's Global Health Assessment, Investigator's Global 
Health Assessment, subject's assessment of pain, HAQ-DI, and CRP). 
Sample size 
Approximately 500 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ABP 501 or adalimumab. 
This sample size was chosen to achieve > 90% power to demonstrate equivalence between the ABP 
501 and adalimumab groups for the primary efficacy endpoint RR of ACR20 at week 24 (with a 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05, assuming an expected ACR20 response for both ABP 501 and adalimumab of 
63% at week 24). Additional assumptions included an equivalence margin of (0.738, 1/0.738) and a 
15% dropout by week 24. 
This planned sample size was also expected to provide > 90% power to demonstrate equivalence 
between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups for the secondary endpoint, change from baseline in 
DAS28-CRP with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a standard deviation of 1.7 for both 
treatment groups, with an equivalence margin of ± 0.6 indicating the clinical equivalence between ABP 
501 and adalimumab. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized to receive either ABP 501 or adalimumab in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization was stratified by geographic region (Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America 
and Latin America) and prior biological use for RA (with prior biological use capped at 40% of the study 
population); for the statistical analyses, North America and Latin America were combined because of 
the low number of subjects that was enrolled in Latin America.

Blinding (masking) 
During the study, subjects and all personnel involved with the conduct and the interpretation of the 
study were blinded to the subjects’ randomized treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The primary efficacy assessment evaluated the hypothesis that there were no clinically meaningful 
differences between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups in the RR of ACR20 at week 24. The 
hypothesis was tested by comparing the 2-sided 90% CIs of the RR of the ACR20 at week 24 between 
the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups, estimated using a log-binomial regression model, with an 
equivalence margin of (0.738, 1/0.738). An inferential analysis was performed only for the primary 
endpoint. A sensitivity analysis of the equivalence test for primary endpoint, the RR of ACR20 at week 
24, was also performed using the per-protocol analysis set. 
The rationale for the equivalence margin was based on considerations in the draft US FDA Non-
inferiority Clinical Trials Guidance For Industry (2010). The equivalence margin of (0.738, 1/0.738) for 
the RR of ACR20 responses was chosen based on a published relevant adequate and well-controlled 
trial (Keystone et al, 2004). 
In addition, a 95% CI of the RR of ACR20 between the ABP501 and adalimumab groups is displayed 
descriptively. The numbers and percentages of subjects meeting and not meeting the ACR20 are 
displayed by treatment group. The risk difference (RD) of ACR20 between the ABP 501 and 
adalimumab groups and corresponding 90% and 95% CIs are displayed descriptively. 
Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The analyses on the secondary endpoints were considered descriptive. Treatment differences across 
assessed time points for the DAS28-CRP change from baseline were evaluated with a repeated-
measures analysis. Besides stratification variables, visit (week), treatment group, treatment-by-visit 
interactions, and baseline DAS28-CRP were included in the model. The 90% and 95% CIs were 
constructed for mean difference of DAS28-CRP change from baseline between ABP 501 and 
adalimumab at each time point. 
The RR and RD of ACR20 at weeks 2 and 8, and the RR and RD of ACR50 and ACR70 at week 24 were 
summarized descriptively by treatment group. Also, the corresponding 90% and 95% CIs for RR and 
RD are estimated using the generalized linear model adjusted for stratification factors.

Conduct of the study 
Amendments to the Original Protocol 
The original protocol dated 01 February 2013 was amended once on 06 June 2013. The primary 
endpoint was changed to RR of ACR20 at week 24 (assuming an expected ACR20 response for both 
ABP 501 and adalimumab of 63% at week 24) between ABP 501 and adalimumab. In addition the 
secondary efficacy criteria were changed and efficacy assessments at weeks 2, 8 and 18 were added. 
This amendment was made before the first patient was enrolled. 
Changes in Study Conduct 
During the study, a printing error was discovered in the horizontal VAS that subjects used to assess 
pain at the injection site. All randomized subjects in the US sites assessed their pain at the injection 
site on a 95-mm horizontal VAS instead of a 100-mm scale. It was decided that all US sites were to 
continue to use the 95-mm VAS for current subjects and any new subjects enrolled. The 95-mm VAS 
was converted to a 100-mm VAS by multiplying the result on the 95-mm VAS by a factor of 100/95 
and rounded to the nearest integer.  
Protocol Violations 
A total of 55 of 526 subjects (10.5%) had 1 or more major protocol violations, and the incidence was 
similar in each group (9.5% vs 11.5% in the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups respectively).

The most common major protocol violation was mis-stratification at randomization because of incorrect 
designation to prior biological use category. This occurred in 4.2% of subjects (11 of 262) in the 
adalimumab group and 2.3% of subjects (6 of 264) in the ABP 501 group. All other major protocol 
violations occurred in < 2% of subjects overall and were generally balanced across treatment groups 
Baseline data

BMI = body mass index 
More than 60% of subjects had a duration of RA ≥ 5 years (overall and for each treatment group), 
with a mean of 9.39 years and a median of 7.09 years since diagnosis. The subject proportions were 
similar between the ABP 501 and adalimumab group for positive RF status at screening: 92.0% versus 
91.6%, respectively. The subject proportions were slightly lower in the ABP 501 group compared with 
the adalimumab group for both RF-positive and anti-CCP-positive status at screening: 73.5% versus 
80.5%, respectively.

(188 of 264) in the ABP 501 group and 72.1% of subjects (189 of 262) in the adalimumab group met 
the ACR20 response criteria. Based on the non-responder imputation analysis, the RR of ACR20 for 
ABP 501 versus adalimumab was 1.000 with the 2-sided 95% CI of RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus 
adalimumab (0.899, 1.113) confirming the clinical equivalence between ABP 501 and adalimumab. 
In the Per Protocol analysis set (n=230 in the ABP group, n=233 in the adalimumab group), 76.5% vs 
76.4% met the ACR20 response criteria at week 24. The RR for ABP 501 vs adalimumab was 1.009

DAS28-CRP Remission 
Proportionally more subjects in the adalimumab group achieved remission compared with the ABP 501 
group from week 2 to week 18. At week 24, approximately one-third of subjects in each treatment 
group had achieved full DAS28-CRP remission. At week 24, 74/243 (30.5%) in the ABP 501 treated 
group and 89/251 (35.5%) in the adalimumab-treated group achieved DAS28-CRP remission. The RR 
was 0.853, with 95% CI (0.662, 1.099).The Risk Difference was -4.954%, 95% CI (-13.237%, 
3.330%). At earlier time points, the opposite was seen, i.e. higher proportions achieving DAS28-CRP 
remission in the ABP 501-treated group.

Mean injection site pain rating scores were lower in the ABP 501 group (range: 10.0 to 10.7 mm) 
compared with the adalimumab group (range: 16.1 to 21.4 mm) at each study visit. Some subjects 
had no pain (0 mm) whereas others had the highest possible pain (100 mm). Mean pain scores were 
similar across all study weeks in the ABP 501 group (range: 10.0 to 10.7 mm). However, mean pain 
scores tended to slightly decrease over time in the adalimumab group, from 21.4 mm at baseline to 
16.1 mm at week 12. Similar results were reported using a sensitivity analysis that excluded subjects 
who used the 95-mm VAS scale (see section “conduct of the study” above).

•  Subject was ≥  18 and ≤  75 years of age at time of screening. Subject had stable moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months. 
•  Subject had involved BSA ≥  10%, PASI ≥  12, and sPGA ≥  3 at screening and baseline. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017

•  Subject was a candidate for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
•  Subject had previously failed, had an inadequate response, intolerance to, or contraindication 
to at least 1 conventional anti-psoriatic systemic therapy (eg, methotrexate, cyclosporine, 
psoralen plus ultraviolet light A). 
Key exclusion criteria included subjects with erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate 
psoriasis, medication-induced psoriasis, or other skin conditions at screening that would interfere with 
evaluations of the effect of IP on psoriasis; and prior use of 2 or more biologics for treatment of 
psoriasis, adalimumab, or a biosimilar of adalimumab. 
This study was conducted at 49 centres in 6 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, 
and Poland).

Objectives 
The  primary  study  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  ABP  501  in  subjects  with  moderate  to 
severe  plaque  psoriasis,  as  measured  by  the  Psoriasis  Area  and  Severity  Index  (PASI)  percent 
improvement from baseline, compared with Humira. 
The  secondary  study  objectives  were  to  assess  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  ABP  501  compared 
with Humira and to assess efficacy in terms of PASI 75 response (75% or greater improvement from 
baseline  in  PASI  score),  static  Physician’s  Global  Assessment  (sPGA),  and  percent  body  surface  area 
(BSA) affected. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 66/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover,  the  exploratory  objectives  were  to  assess  the  perception  of  injection  site  pain  based  on 
subjects’ rankings for ABP 501 compared with Humira injections. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The Primary efficacy endpoint was PASI percent improvement from baseline at week 16. 
PASI score 
The PASI score is a measure of the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness 
(scaling), each graded on a 0 to 4 scale of the lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the 4 
main body areas (head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) (Feldman and 
Krueger, 2005).  A higher PASI score indicates greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included PASI percent improvement from baseline to weeks 32 and 50; 
PASI 75 responses at weeks 16, 32, and 50; Static Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) responses at 
weeks 16, 32 and 50, and body surface area (BSA) involvement at weeks 16, 32, and 50 .  
sPGA 
The sPGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease (induration, scaling, and 
erythema). 
BSA 
BSA an estimate made by assuming that the subject’s palm, excluding the fingers and thumb, 
represents roughly 1% of the body’s surface area. 
An additional efficacy analysis defined in the SAP was PASI 50 response at weeks 16, 32, and 50. 
Subject assessment of pain at the injection site was an exploratory endpoint.  The subject's 
assessment of pain immediately after injection of ABP 501 or adalimumab was measured using a 
horizontal visual analog scale (VAS), with extremes ranging from "no pain at all" (0 on the scale) to "a 
lot of pain" (100 on the scale). 
Sample size 
Approximately 340 subjects (170 subjects per treatment group) were to be enrolled. This sample size 
was chosen to provide > 90% power to demonstrate equivalence at a significance level of 0.025 on the 
primary endpoint of PASI percent improvement from baseline at week 16 with margins of (-15, 15). 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by geographic region (Eastern Europe, Western Europe, “Other” 
[Australia and Canada]) and prior biologic use for Ps (yes/no, with prior biologic use capped at 50% of 
the study population). Eligible subjects who continued treatment beyond week 16 were re-randomized 
in a blinded fashion as described above. Subjects without a PASI 50 or better response within the week 
16 visit window were discontinued from the study. 
Blinding (masking)

Statistical methods 
Primary Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint, PASI percent improvement from baseline at week 16, was analyzed 
using the full analysis set with missing values imputed using the last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) method. Clinical equivalence of the primary endpoint was evaluated by comparing the 2-sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference of PASI percent improvement from baseline to week 16 
between Treatment A (ABP 501) and Treatment B (adalimumab) with an equivalence margin of (-15, 
15). The 2-sided 95% CI of the group difference was estimated using an ANCOVA model with baseline 
PASI score and stratification factors (geographic region and prior biologic use for psoriasis) as 
covariates. The PASI percent improvement was summarized descriptively for all measured timepoints. 
The 95% and 90% CIs for the difference of treatments were presented descriptively. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
To assess the robustness of the primary PASI percent improvement from baseline results, the primary 
analysis was repeated using the full analysis set based on observed cases and per-protocol analysis set 
based on observed cases. Another sensitivity analysis was done to explore the impact of the following 
covariates relative to PASI percent improvement at week 16 in addition to the randomization 
stratification factors: age group (< 65 years and ≥  65 years), race, sex, disease duration (< 5 years 
and ≥  5 years), neutralizing antidrug antibody status, concomitant topical steroid use, and prior use of 
systemic or phototherapies. All the covariates were to be included in the model, and backwards model 
selection was used to determine if any of the listed covariates had an impact on the primary efficacy 
endpoint at the significance of 0.10. The model maintained treatment, baseline PASI score, and the 
stratification factors regardless. This sensitivity analysis used the full analysis set with LOCF 
imputation. For each subgroup of stratification factors, age group (< 65 years and ≥  65 years), race, 
sex, disease duration group (< 5 years and ≥  5 years), neutralizing antidrug antibody status, 
concomitant topical steroid use, and prior use of systemic or phototherapies, the PASI percent 
improvement at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 was also examined in the subgroups descriptively. This 
sensitivity analysis used the full analysis set with LOCF imputation. PASI percent improvement was 
also analyzed based on a repeated measures analysis, where data from all assessed timepoints 
through the week 16 visit were included as observed for the full analysis set. In addition to 
stratification variables and baseline PASI score, visit week (as a categorical variable), treatment, and 
treatment-by-visit interaction were included in this mixed model repeated measures analysis.

Amendments to the Original Protocol 
The original protocol, dated 18 March 2013, was amended once on 03 December 2013. 
The following are the most important changes covered by the amendment: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
deleted PASI percent change as a secondary efficacy parameter 
narrowed the equivalence margin used to assess clinical equivalence of PASI percent 
improvement to ± 15 
added additional efficacy assessments at the week 32 visit 
specified that the primary analysis would be based on randomized treatment assignment 
specified that the primary analysis would occur after all subjects completed week 20 
Protocol violations 
A total of 35 of 350 subjects (10.0%) had 1 or more major protocol violations from baseline through 
week 16, and the incidence was similar in each treatment group. The most common protocol violation 
was mis-stratification at randomization because of incorrect assignment to prior biological treatment 
category. All other major protocol violations occurred in ≤ 2% of subjects overall.

Note: The baseline timepoints were offset to provide clarity and each timepoint was equally spaced for all visits for consistency. 
The 95% CI for all sensitivity analyses were within ±10% for all sensitivity analyses, and hence 
consistent with the primary analysis. 
To assess the robustness of the primary PASI percent improvement from baseline results, the primary 
analysis was repeated using the FAS based on observed cases and the PP analysis set based on 
observed cases through week 16. When analysed using the FAS as observed and the PP analysis set as 
observed, the treatment differences in PASI percent improvement from baseline between the ABP 501 
and adalimumab treatment groups were -1.46 (2-sided 95% CI: [-6.31, 3.39]) and -2.64 (2-sided 
95% CI: [-6.89, 1.60]), respectively.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Not performed. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The purpose of this development program was to evaluate similarity between ABP 501 and the 
reference product, adalimumab, including an assessment of the effects of any observed differences 
between the products, if such differences exist.  Therefore, in accordance with regulatory guidances, 
safety studies in special groups (eg, pediatrics and elderly) are not required and are not included in 
this marketing application. Based on demonstrated analytical, nonclinical, PK, and clinical similarity of 
ABP 501 to adalimumab, no additional studies in special populations are warranted. This is supported 
by the CHMP. 
Supportive study 
PK-study 20110217 was a single-dose study in healthy subjects. It is described and discussed in the 
Pharmacological section. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity similarity of ABP 501 to adalimumab is based on data from 
Study 20120262 in adult subjects with moderate to severe RA and Study 20120263 in adult subjects 
with moderate to severe Psoriasis. 
The Applicant has sought CHMP advice on the development program, and broadly followed the received 
recommendations. 
20120262 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
The choice of RA population entails concomitant use of MTX, which due to its immune modulatory 
effect hampers the evaluation of immunogenicity. However, a study in psoriasis was also conducted 
which gathered further data on immunogenicity. 
The inclusion criteria for the RA study are acceptable. The endpoints used are validated and in line with 
scientific advice, and what has been used in previous RA studies. The primary endpoint was proportion 
of ACR20 at week 24, and equivalence measured as Risk ratio (RR). The choice of ACR20 as primary 
endpoint is in accordance with given CHMP Scientific Advice and is endorsed. It is considered 
acceptable to present the results as RR. Secondary efficacy endpoints used are validated and in line 
with what has been used in previous RA studies. 
The sample size of 500 subjects seems adequate to demonstrate equivalence between the ABP 501 
and Humira groups assuming a margin of (0.738, 1/0.738) for the primary efficacy endpoint RR of 
ACR20. The calculation is based on an expected ACR20 response for both ABP 501 and Humira of 63% 
at week 24. The choice of the 0.738 margin on a multiplicative scale would correspond to an absolute 
margin of more than -16% on the additive scale. This could be considered too wide. It is noteworthy 
that if the same multiplicative margin of 0.738 is considered but assuming a higher expected ACR20 
response at week 24 for both arms (i.e. a response of similar magnitude to that obtained in the study: 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 85/120 
 
 
 
 
 
72%) the resulting absolute margin would be inflated to about -20%. However, in light of the results 
observed this does not represent an issue that could compromise the reliability of the study. 
For DAS-28 CRP, the equivalence margin of ±0.6 was chosen. This has been endorsed in a scientific 
advice. 
Sensitivity analyses used the FAS with non-responder imputation, FAS based on observed cases, and 
the per protocol (PP) analysis set based on observed cases.  Inferential analyses were performed only 
for the primary endpoint. 
Randomisation and blinding methods are acceptable. 
All randomized subjects in the US sites assessed their pain at the injection site on a 95-mm horizontal 
VAS instead of a 100-mm scale due to a printing error. Therefore the results captured on the shorter 
VAS scale were multiplied by a factor of 100/95. This may not provide correct results in the extremes 
of the scale, since the choice of point in these regions may be more related to the absolute distance 
from min/max, than proportion of the whole scale. However, there is no apparent better way to handle 
this error, which affected both treatment groups equally (68 subjects in the ABP group, 69 in the 
adalimumab group). It is not considered to significantly impact the evaluation of similarity, which is 
supported by a sensitivity analysis where the results from the US sites were excluded. CHMP 
considered that the issue was appropriately handled.  
The number of protocol violations was relatively high (10.5%) but equally distributed between groups 
(9.5% vs 11.5%). The most common major protocol violation was mis-stratification at randomization 
because of incorrect designation to prior biological use category. This variable was also included as a 
covariate in the primary analysis and has been used in the analysis model for the primary analysis in 
order to be consistent with the randomization scheme, and that covariate values collected via the eCRF 
have been used for subgroup analyses. This is considered acceptable. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were reasonably balanced between the treatment groups.  
Study 20120263: Psoriasis 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable and the study design is generally in line with given 
scientific advice although the chosen primary endpoint is not the same that was discussed in the Follow 
up CHMP scientific advice (proportion PASI 75), but percentage improvement in PASI from baseline at 
Week 16. PASI 75 is used as a secondary endpoint. Primary endpoint was analysed using the full 
analysis set (FAS) with missing values imputed using LOCF. This is considered acceptable. The 
equivalence analysis was based on 95% Confidence Intervals which is endorsed. However, the 
equivalence margin of (-15; 15) in percent improvement in PASI score at week 16 is considered wide. 
However, the Applicant clarified that the sample size calculation was formally derived using PASI 
percent improvement (and not the original endpoint PASI75 response) assuming a Standard Deviation 
(SD) of 31.7. Taking into account the results of the primary endpoint this does not represent an issue 
that could compromise the reliability of the study. 
Randomization and blinding methods are acceptable. 
Discontinuation through week 16 was balanced between the treatment groups. The proportion of 
subjects that completed the IP, as well as the study, was balanced between the 2 groups adalimumab 
treated patients re-randomized to ABP 501, and re-randomized to stay on adalimumab. 
The number of protocol violations was relatively high, but equally distributed between groups. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 86/120 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 59 major protocol violations mainly related to the use of prohibited medication in particular 
topical steroids, were reported. 36 subjects used any topical corticosteroids through the entire study. 
However, through week 16 only three (two in the ABP 501 and one in Adalimumab group) out of the 
36 subjects were identified as using class I (super potent) and/or class II (potent) topical 
corticosteroids that were considered prohibited as for protocol. Of these three subjects, only one 
patient (in the ABP 501 group) was included in the per protocol (PP) analyses. Therefore, this single 
subject is unlikely to have had any meaningful impact on the analysis of similarity of ABP 501 to 
adalimumab.   
Demographics and baseline psoriasis characteristics were reasonably balanced between the treatment 
groups. A total of 241 out of 347 IP treated subjects (69.5%) had used topical medications before the 
study but the medication was stopped before the subject received the first dose of investigational 
product. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 20120262: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
At week 24, 74.6% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and 72.4% of subjects in the adalimumab group 
met the ACR20 response criteria. The RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab was 1.039 with the 
2-sided 95% CI (0.938, 1.152). The point estimate is thus close to 1 with a narrow CI and is 
considered to indicate similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab.  
When calculating the responder rate, LOCF was only used for patients with post-baseline values. A 
sensitivity analysis including patients with baseline values has been provided. The result does not 
change the evaluation of clinical equivalence between ABP 501 and the reference product. 
The chosen equivalence margin for RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab at week 24 has not 
been clinically justified by the applicant. However, the point estimate of the primary endpoint is close 
to 1 and has narrow CI limits. Given that after 24 weeks of treatment an effect plateau may have been 
reached, making the end point less sensitive, the totality of data, including response in the respective 
treatment arms per visit is also highly important. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
At week 2, 35.4% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and 24.5% of subjects in the adalimumab group 
met the ACR20 response criteria. The RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab was 1.421 with the 
2-sided 95% CI of (1.086, 1.860). ABP 501 thus showed a statistically significant superiority over 
Humira after 2 weeks treatment.  At week 4, the difference between ABP 501 and adalimumab was 
smaller than week 2, and no longer statistically significant. At weeks 8 and 18 results were very similar 
between groups, with 95% CI for the risk difference within +/-10%. At week 12, ABP 501 again 
showed a statistically significant better effect. In summary, at week 2 and week 12, a significant 
difference in effect between the original product and the biosimilar is seen. However, since there are 
no statistically significant differences in other variables (ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28-CRP) in early time 
points, the difference seen at early time points in ACR20 is most likely a chance finding rather than a 
real difference in onset of action.  
In contrast to the ACR20 results, for ACR50, the difference at week 2 was not statistically significant, 
although the point estimate was well above 1 (RR 1.7). At week 12, there was a difference in favour of 
adalimumab. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 87/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For ACR70 response, no statistically significant differences were seen and the point estimates of RR 
and RD were low. It should be noted that for ACR70 response, numbers are small, in particular in the 
beginning of the study. 
At week 24, the difference between treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in DAS28-CRP 
also demonstrated similarity. 
At week 24, 30.5% in the ABP 501 treated group and 35.5% in the adalimumab-treated group 
achieved DAS28-CRP remission. At earlier time points, the opposite was seen, i.e. higher proportions 
achieving DAS28-CRP remission in the ABP 501-treated group. Numbers are small, however the results 
also supportive of similarity. 
Mean injection site pain rating scores were lower in the ABP 501 group compared with the adalimumab 
group at each study visit. This difference in scoring rates between groups in favour of ABP 501 is not 
considered to question biosimilarity, since it is most probably due to differences in excipients. 
The incidence of subjects developing binding or neutralizing antibodies was similar between ABP 501 
and adalimumab. 
Study 20120263: Psoriasis 
Primary endpoint 
The PASI score decreased substantially through Week 16 in both groups. The mean percent 
improvement in the ABP 501-treated group was 80.91% vs 83.06% in the adalimumab group. The 
treatment difference was -2.18% with 95% CI (-7.39, 3.02). This is a narrow CI, well within the 
predefined interval of ±15%, and also within the more conservative ±10. The results of the primary 
endpoint are thus considered to be compatible with clinical equivalence.  
Secondary endpoints 
When looking at the results for the originally discussed primary endpoint, proportion of PASI 75, the 
point estimate for the treatment difference at week 16 was -7.73%  in favour of adalimumab.. Also at 
earlier visits the same trend was seen. However, clinical equivalence was evaluated only for the 
primary efficacy endpoint and the margin of ±15 refers only to PASI percent improvement. Moreover, 
the study was not powered to evaluate equivalence of secondary endpoints against the same pre-
defined margin of the primary endpoint. 
The difference between groups in favour of adalimumab that was noted for PASI 75 was detected also 
for sPGA (n.s.). The trend in favour of adalimumab in sPGA was maintained through Week 50. In 
contrast, the BSA involvement results as well as PASI 50 90 and 100 results are compatible with 
similarity.  
After re-randomisation at week 16 the number of patients per group is subsequently smaller. This 
results in more uncertain point estimates with wider CIs.  
Improvement achieved in PASI during the first 16 weeks of treatment was maintained over time, 
equally in both groups.  
Larger differences between ABP501 and Humira were observed in the PASI percent improvement at 
week 16, when patients with neutralizing antibodies are considered. However, from baseline to week 
50 no important differences were observed in PASI percent improvement between ABP501/ABP501 
group and Humira/Humira group in presence of neutralizing-antibodies. Moreover, despite the higher 
incidence of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies reported in the Humira/ABP 501 group compared to both 
ABP 501/ABP 501 and Humira/Humira groups it is of reassurance that patients who shifted from 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 88/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Humira to ABP501 treatment did not show a worsening in efficacy (in terms of PASI percent 
improvement) compared to patients who remained in Humira treatment. In addition, a clinical review 
of individual data for neutralizing ADA positive subjects at week 16 was performed along with the 
titers. Individual data provided, although difficult to analyse, do not seem to suggest a possible 
correlation between neutralizing ADA titre and efficacy results in either treatment group. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, ABP 501 has in the RA study shown similarity to adalimumab in several analyses. The primary 
endpoint was met, and similarity at week 24 was indicated with low point estimates and narrow CI 
intervals both for ACR20 RR and Risk Difference. Also mean change in DAS28-CRP showed high 
similarity at all visits. ACR20 results per visit showed significant differences which may be interpreted 
as indicating a faster onset of effect for ABP 501, which could question similarity. However, these 
results are not seen for DAS28 which is favourable, or for ACR50 or ACR70, and as such it is 
concluded, that the difference seen at week 2 in ACR20 is likely to be a chance finding rather than a 
true difference. 
Also the psoriasis study met the primary endpoint with a point estimate of difference of 2% with 
narrow CIs, indicating similarity. The secondary endpoints PASI 75 and sPGA showed point estimates 
of 7% difference with a wide CI.  
Overall, clinical similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab has been demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1076 subjects were treated with ABP 501 or adalimumab (US or EU) in clinical studies in 
healthy subjects or patient populations (RA or Ps) (Table 45). Safety findings are reported for 582 
subjects administered ABP 501 in the clinical development program.  Of note, in Study 20120263, 
22.0% (77 of 350) of subjects underwent a single transition in treatment from adalimumab to ABP 501 
(adalimumab/ABP 501)

a Sixty-nine subjects were exposed to adalimumab (US); 67 subjects were exposed to adalimumab (EU). 
In Study 20120262, all 526 subjects randomized received at least 1 dose of IP; therefore, the efficacy 
population (FAS) is identical to the safety population. 
In Study 20120263, 347 of 350 (99.1%) subjects randomized received at least 1 dose of IP; thus, the 
efficacy population (FAS) and the safety population were similar.  
In Study 20110217, all 203 randomized received a single dose of IP; therefore, the PK population 
described is identical to the safety population. 
The proposed dosing regimens for ABP 501 are based on those currently approved for adalimumab for 
adult and paediatric patients for the indications for which licensure is sought. 
In Study 20120262, the overall median exposure duration was 155 days (range 1 to 164 days); the 
median duration was identical for both the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups. In Study 20120263, from 
baseline to week 16 (re-randomization), the median exposure duration was 92 days (range 6 to 99 
days); the median duration was identical for both the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups. Post week 16, 
the overall media exposure duration was 225 days (range 1 to 233 days) and was identical for the 3 
treatment groups (ABP 501/ABP 501, adalimumab/adalimumab, and adalimumab/ABP 501). Through 
the entire study (Study 20120263), most subjects received 25 total doses of IP; median exposure was 
330 days.

Common adverse events 
Pharmacokinetic Similarity Study in Healthy Subject 
In Study 20110217, treatment-emergent adverse events reported for more than 5% of subjects 
overall, by preferred term were headache, oropharyngeal pain, sinus congestion, nasopharyngitis, and 
nausea. Of these, headache, oropharyngeal pain and sinus congestion were reported at a higher rate 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 92/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the ABP 501-treated group: 28.4% in the ABP 501 group reported headache, as compared to 
23.2% in the adalimumab(US) group and 19.4% in the adalimumab(EU) group. If adalimumab is 
reported together the report rate for headache would be 21.8%.  
Phase 3 Controlled Clinical Studies 
In Study 20120262, the adverse event by preferred term with the highest subject incidence (≥  5% 
overall) was nasopharyngitis (6.8%), and the rates were similar between the 2 groups (6.4% vs 7.3% 
for the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups respectively). In Study 20120263 through week 16, adverse 
events by preferred term with the highest subject incidence (≥  5% overall) were nasopharyngitis 
(15.0%), headache (8.6%), and upper respiratory tract infection (5.2%), and the rates were similar 
between the 2 groups. 
There were no major differences in frequency of grade 1-4 AEs between treatment groups in either 
study. 
In both studies, treatment-emergent adverse events were most commonly reported in the SOCs of 
Infections and Infestations, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders, Skin and subcutaneous 
disorders and Gastrointestinal Disorders. Generally, adverse events occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects by 
SOC were balanced between the 2 treatment groups, except for General Disorders and Administration 
Site Conditions which occurred at about half the rate in the ABP 501 treatment group in the RA study, 
and two thirds in the psoriasis study through week 16, as compared to the adalimumab treatment 
groups.   
Events of special interest 
The EOIs for the 2 studies in therapeutic indications are based on the known safety risks for 
adalimumab and include the following: infections, malignancies, hypersensitivity reactions, 
demyelinating disease, haematological reactions, heart failure, lupus-like syndrome, liver enzyme 
elevations, and injection site reactions. No events were identified in the EOIs including demyelinating 
disease or lupus-like syndrome in either study.

interest, subjects are included only once for that event of interest in the number of subjects column. Multiple events were counted separately in 
the number of events column. 
Hypersensitivity 
In the RA study, standard searches identified 31 events of hypersensitivity in 24 of 526 subjects 
(4.6%); 18 of these events occurred in 14 of 264 subjects (5.3%) in the ABP 501 group and 13 events 
occurred in 10 of 262 subjects (3.8%) in the adalimumab group. 
The most commonly reported (1% or more of subjects overall) hypersensitivity treatment-emergent 
adverse event was rash (1.9% and 0.4%) for subjects in the ABP 501 and adalimumab treatment 
groups, respectively. 
In the psoriasis study through week 16, standard searches identified 17 events of hypersensitivity in 
15 of 347 subjects (4.3%); 9 of these events occurred in 8 of 174 subjects (4.6%) in the ABP 501 
group and 8 events occurred in 7 of 173 subjects (4.0%) in the adalimumab group. 
In the RA study, 11 ABP 501-treated subjects experienced any kind of rash (PT: rash, rash 
erythematous, rash pruritic, rash morbilliform, drug eruption) compared to 5 in the adalimumab–
treated group (PT rash, rash erythematous, rash pruritic, rash macular). This trend was not observed 
through Week 16 in the psoriasis study. Through Week 16, 3 cases of Rash (including PTs Rash, Rash 
pruritic) were reported from the adalimumab group, 0 for ABP 501. Post Week 16 in the psoriasis study 
3 subjects experienced rash in the ABP group and 1 in the adalimumab group. Two subjects reported 
urticaria after switching to ABP 501, however the AE occurred months after the switching in both 
cases. 
Injection site Reactions 
There  was  an  imbalance  in  both  studies  for  injection  site  reactions,  in  favour  of  ABP  501,  2.3%  vs 
5.0% in the RA study, and 1.7% vs 5.2% in the psoriasis study through Week 16. After the switch in 
Week 16, no infection site reactions occurred in the adalimumab/ABP 501 group. The Applicant states 
that  “the  excipients  in  ABP  501  and  adalimumab  drug  product  are  different,  which  most  likely 
contributed to the difference in pain perception among subjects”.

Liver Enzyme Elevation Adverse Events 
Per protocol, subjects with AST and/or ALT ≥2 times the upper limit of normal at baseline were 
excluded from the phase 3 studies. 
In the RA study liver enzyme elevation events, occurred in 4.9% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and 
in 3.8% in the adalimumab group. 
Also in the psoriasis study, slightly more cases of liver AEs were observed in the ABP 501 group 
through Week 16. After week 16, i.e. after longer use, there was a more obvious imbalance between 
the ABP 501/ABP 501 group and the adalimumab group in liver AE (5.9 vs 2.5%). 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
No subjects died in Study 20110217 or in either phase 3 controlled studies. Serious adverse events 
were reported infrequently, 4.4% of subjects in Study 20120262 and 6.6% of subjects through the 
entire study in Study 20120263. No major differences in frequency or pattern of SAEs between 
treatment arms in the two phase 3 studies have been seen. 
Laboratory findings 
General haematology and chemistry assessments were conducted in the 3 clinical studies. Overall, 
there were no clinically meaningful differences in haematology laboratory results between the ABP 501 
and adalimumab groups in neither the RA nor the Psoriasis study. 
Chemistry Laboratory Results 
Serum chemistry (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase [GGT], 
sodium, potassium, albumin, total protein, non-fasting glucose, urea, and creatinine) laboratory values 
at baseline and change from baseline were summarized using descriptive statistics at each analysis 
visit by treatment. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 96/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were slightly more liver AEs in the ABP 501 treated groups. Other chemistry laboratory results 
did not show major differences between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of adverse events by age, race, and sex, and for study 20120262 prior biological 
use for RA, by SOC showed no notable differences in the subject incidence of adverse events when 
compared with the overall population and between each treatment group.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 1076 subjects were treated with ABP 501 or adalimumab (US or EU) in clinical studies in 
healthy subjects or patient populations (RA or Psoriasis). Safety findings are reported for 582 subjects 
administered ABP 501 in the clinical development program.  Of note, in Study 20120263, 22.0% (77 of 
350) of subjects underwent a single transition in treatment from adalimumab to ABP 501 
(adalimumab/ABP 501). Safety results were reported per study. 
In Study 20120262, in subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, in the ABP-treated 
group, more subjects discontinued investigational product (IP) (6.8% vs 4.6%) and study continuation 
(8.0% vs 4.2%). The major reasons were AEs and consent withdrawal. There was no trend of specific 
AEs leading to withdrawal, and no major difference in frequency between groups.  
In the RA study, 4.6% more subjects in the adalimumab group experienced any AE.In the psoriasis 
study, AEs were reported for 3.6% more subjects in the ABP 501 group at Week 16. If pooled, the 
difference after 16 weeks of treatment was 1.4% in favour of ABP 501. The described differences in AE 
rates between treatment groups within the Gastrointestinal Disorder SOCs are based on small 
numbers, and the difference between groups in the psoriasis study was not seen in the RA study and is 
not considered to question the similarity. 
Through the entire psoriasis study, it was noted that there is a slight difference in any AE rates 
between the group that stayed on adalimumab (78.5%) and the groups that switched to ABP 501 
(85.7%) or received it through the whole study (86.2%). The Applicant provided on request 
recalculated AE tables 26, 27 and 28, where injection site reactions were excluded. When adjusted for

the lower incidence of local reactions for ABP 501, the imbalance in any AEs between groups does not 
increase, probably because most of the subjects with injection site reactions also experienced other 
AEs. No particular PT contributing to the imbalance was identified, and there was no trend for more 
SAEs among the ABP 501-treated subjects. 
In the phase I study in healthy subjects, headache, oropharyngeal pain and sinus congestion were 
reported at a higher rate for the ABP 501-treated group (28.4%), than in the pooled adalimumab 
group (21.8%). In contrast, no difference in headache rate was seen in the RA study, and in the 
psoriasis study the difference was in favour of ABP 501. These diverging results make it plausible that 
they are by chance findings. 
No subjects died in Study 20110217 or in either phase 3 controlled studies. Serious adverse events 
were reported infrequently, 4.4% of subjects in Study 20120262 and 6.6% of subjects through the 
entire study in Study 20120263.No major differences in frequency or pattern of SAEs between 
treatment arms in the two phase 3 studies have been seen. Numerically, slightly more events in the 
ABP 501 group were seen in the psoriasis study, the opposite in the RA study. No difference in SAE 
rates between subjects who continued on Adalimumab in subjects who switched to ABP 501 was seen 
during the 32 weeks after the switch. 
Post Week 16 in the psoriasis study, there was an imbalance between ABP 501 and adalimumab in the 
infection SOC, mainly driven by PTs representing viral infections, or infections where virus is the 
predominant pathogen, (nasopharyngitis, URTI, influenza, Oral herpes, Pharyngitis, Rhinitis, herpes 
zoster, viral infection, laryngitis, viral pharyngitis). In study 20120263 through 16 weeks, the higher 
incidence of infections in the ABP 501 group was not seen, and in study 20120262 the difference was 
smaller. The results are considered to be by chance findings. 
In the RA study, 11 ABP 501-treated subjects experienced any kind of rash (PT: rash, rash 
erythematous, rash pruritic, rash morbilliform, drug eruption) compared to 5 in the adalimumab–
treated group (PT rash, rash erythematous, rash pruritic, rash macular). This trend was not observed 
through Week 16 in the psoriasis study. Through Week 16, 3 cases of Rash (including PTs Rash, Rash 
pruritic) were reported from the adalimumab group, 0 for ABP 501. Post Week 16 in the psoriasis study 
3 subjects experienced rash in the ABP 501 group and 1 in the adalimumab group. Two subjects 
reported urticaria after switching to ABP 501, however the AE occurred months after the switching in 
both cases. 
There was an imbalance in injection site reactions, in favour of ABP 501. This could be explained by 
differences in the excipients in ABP 501 and adalimumab drug product, which most likely contributed 
to the difference in pain perception among subjects. 
In both studies, hypersensitivity AEs was higher in ABP501 arms.  
Data on hypersensitivity and injection site reactions adverse events stratified by ADA and neutralizing 
ADA status has been provided for both studies. Overall, although a certain trend is noted between ADA 
positivity and occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions in ABP501 treated subjects, the limited number 
of subgroups hampers a sound conclusion. 
In the RA study liver enzyme elevation events, occurred in 4.9% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and 
in 3.8% in the adalimumab group. Also in the psoriasis study, slightly more cases of liver AEs were 
observed in the ABP 501 group through Week 16 with a more obvious imbalance between the ABP 
501/ABP 501 group and the adalimumab group post week 16 in liver AE (5.9 vs 2.5%). However, 
numbers are small, and the reported events occurred to a large extent in subjects with abnormal 
baseline values.

Besides the liver AEs discussed above, there were no clinically meaningful differences in laboratory 
results between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups in neither the RA nor the Psoriasis study. 
The purpose of this biosimilar development program is to evaluate similarity between ABP 501 and the 
reference product, adalimumab, including an assessment of the effects of any observed differences 
between the products, if such differences exist.  Therefore, in accordance with regulatory guidances, 
safety studies in special groups (eg, pediatrics and elderly) are not required and are not included in 
this marketing application.  
In the RA study, the incidence of subjects developing binding or neutralizing antibodies was similar 
between ABP 501 and adalimumab. 
When evaluating anti-drug antibodies (ADA), in the RA study, the point estimate for the difference in 
ADA rate is very low, 0.219% (-8.139%, 8.578%). Through Week 16 in the psoriasis study, the 
treatment difference was higher, -8.122% (-18.242%, 1.998%). Since it is in favour of the biosimilar 
candidate, this was considered to be acceptable by CHMP since it is in accordance with “Guideline on 
similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies” 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). In the psoriasis study, subjects did not use MTX concomitantly, and 
this is probably the explanation for the higher rate of ADAs in this population. 
It is noted that the ADA rate was high through the entire psoriasis study, lasting for 52 weeks (68.4%, 
74.7% and 72.7% in the ABP 501/ABP 501, adalimumab/adalimumab, and adalimumab/ABP 501 
groups, respectively). However, there were no indications of an increased incidence of ADAs after 
switching from adalimumab to ABP 501, and no increase in clinical hypersensitivity reactions in the 
adalimumab/ABP 501 group.  
In Study 20110217 immunogenicity between treatments was similar. It is noted that the rates of ADAs 
and neutralizing antibodies are high, and rising over time after only one injection, but the results do 
not question similarity. 
The treatment difference for the rate of neutralizing ADAs did not raise concerns for similarity.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
AMGEVITA is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Humira (adalimumab). The proposed 
indications for AMGEVITA are those approved for Humira. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity similarity of ABP 501 to adalimumab is based on data from 
Study 20120262 in adult subjects with moderate to severe RA and Study 20120263 in adult subjects 
with moderate to severe Plaque Psoriasis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
ABP 501 has been developed as an adalimumab biosimilar. In the development of a biosimilar product, 
there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient per se as this has been shown for the 
reference product. The purpose of a biosimilar application is therefore to demonstrate similarity to the 
reference product. This has been assessed from a quality, non-clinical, pharmacokinetic and clinical 
perspective, and the conclusion is based upon the totality of data. 
From a quality and non-clinical perspective, data has been presented that shows that ABP 501 is highly 
similar to the reference product Humira. 
From a pharmacokinetic perspective, pharmacokinetic similarity is considered sufficiently demonstrated 
between ABP 501 and the reference product. 
From a clinical perspective, two phase 3 studies have been performed, in RA and psoriasis. The point 
estimate of the primary endpoint of the RA study (RR of ACR20 at week 24 between ABP 501 and 
Humira) was 1.039 with the 2-sided 95% CI of RR (0.938, 1.152) and in the psoriasis study the point 
estimate of the primary endpoint (difference in PASI percent improvement at week 16 between ABP 
501 vs Humira) was-2.18 with 95% CI (-7.39, 3.02). Thus, the Primary endpoints were met in both 
studies, with small point estimates for the difference between the reference product and ABP 501, with 
95% CI within narrow limits. Equivalence has been shown. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties or limitations that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance. 
Assessment report Amgevita 
EMA/106922/2017  
Page 116/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of ABP 501 are similar to those of Humira, and this application aimed to show 
that the safety profiles of Humira and ABP 501 are similar. Overall, the safety profile of ABP 501 is 
considered to be highly similar to that of Humira.  No major safety concerns were detected. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Through the entire psoriasis study, it is noted that there is a slight difference in any AE rates between 
the group that stayed on adalimumab (78.5%) and the groups that switched to ABP 501 (85.7%) or 
received it through the whole study (86.2%). The difference does not seem to be driven by particular 
PTs, and recalculating AE tables with local AEs excluded did not change the outcome.  
After week 16, i.e. after longer use, there is an imbalance between the ABP 501/ABP 501 group and 
the adalimumab group in liver AE (5.9 vs 2.5%).  However, numbers are small, several of the ABP 501 
treated subjects with abnormal liver enzymes had elevated values also at baseline, and it is considered 
unlikely that this imbalance reflects non similarity. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The Applicant provided a thorough comparative exercise in terms of quality, efficacy and safety 
parameters in line with EU guidance to demonstrate biosimilarity between ABP 501 and Humira. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Since similarity has been convincingly shown, the benefit-risk balance of ABP 501 is regarded as equal 
to the BR balance of Humira in its authorized indications. Thus, the BR balance of ABP 501 is 
considered as positive. 
With the totality of evidence, the CHMP considered that it was justifiable to extrapolate the equivalent 
clinical efficacy and the comparable safety profile from the ABP 501 studies in RA patients to all of the 
indications where Humira has been approved 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk balance of AMGEVITA is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of AMGEVITA is favourable in the following indication:

Rheumatoid arthritis  
AMGEVITA in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been 
inadequate.  
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously 
treated with methotrexate.  
• 
AMGEVITA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.  
AMGEVITA reduces the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by x-ray and improves 
physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.

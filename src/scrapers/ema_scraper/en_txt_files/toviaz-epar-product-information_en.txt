CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
TOVIAZ is indicated in adults for treatment of the symptoms (increased urinary frequency and/or 
urgency and/or urgency incontinence) that may occur with overactive bladder syndrome.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults (including elderly)
The recommended starting dose is 4 mg once daily. Based upon individual response, the dose may be 
increased to 8 mg once daily. The maximum daily dose is 8 mg.
Full treatment effect was observed between 2 and 8 weeks. Hence, it is recommended to re-evaluate 
the efficacy for the individual patient after 8 weeks of treatment.
2
In subjects with normal renal and hepatic function receiving concomitant administration of potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, the maximum daily dose of TOVIAZ should be 4 mg once daily (see section 4.5). 
Special population

Special warnings and precautions for use
TOVIAZ should be used with caution in patients with:
-
-
-
-
-
-
Clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction at risk of urinary retention (e.g. clinically 
significant prostate enlargement due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, see section 4.3)
Gastrointestinal obstructive disorders (e.g. pyloric stenosis)
Gastro-oesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking medicinal products (such as oral 
bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate oesophagitis
Decreased gastrointestinal motility
Autonomic neuropathy
Controlled narrow-angle glaucoma
Caution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating fesoterodine to patients in whom an 
increased exposure to the active metabolite (see section 5.1) is expected:
-
-
-
-
Hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2)
Renal impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2)
Concomitant administration of potent or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5)
Concomitant administration of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
Dose increases
In patients with a combination of these factors, additional exposure increases are expected. Dose 
dependent antimuscarinic adverse reactions are likely to occur. In populations where the dose may be 
increased to 8 mg once daily, the dose increase should be preceded by an evaluation of the individual 
response and tolerability.
Organic causes must be excluded before any treatment with antimuscarinics is considered. Safety and 
efficacy have not yet been established in patients with a neurogenic cause for detrusor overactivity.
Other causes of frequent urination (treatment of heart failure or renal disease) should be assessed 
before treatment with fesoterodine. If urinary tract infection is present, an appropriate medical 
approach should be taken/antibacterial therapy should be started.
Angioedema
Angioedema has been reported with fesoterodine and has occurred after the first dose in some cases.
Some cases may be associated with upper airway swelling and may be life-threatening. If angioedema 
occurs, fesoterodine should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be promptly provided.
Potent CYP3A4 inducers
The concomitant use of fesoterodine with a potent CYP3A4 inducer (i.e. carbamazepine, rifampicin, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, St John’s Wort) is not recommended (see section 4.5).
QT prolongation
TOVIAZ should be used with caution in patients with risk for QT prolongation (e.g. hypokalaemia, 
bradycardia and concomitant administration of medicines known to prolong QT interval) and relevant 
pre-existing cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure), (see 
section 4.8). This especially holds true when taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.5 
and 5.1).
Lactose
TOVIAZ prolonged-release tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicine.

4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacological interactions
Caution should be exercised in coadministration of fesoterodine with other antimuscarinics and 
medicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e.g. amantadine, tri-cyclic antidepressants, certain 
neuroleptics) as this may lead to more pronounced therapeutic- and side-effects (e.g. constipation, dry 
mouth, drowsiness, urinary retention).
Fesoterodine may reduce the effect of medicinal products that stimulate the motility of the 
gastro-intestinal tract, such as metoclopramide.
Pharmacokinetic interactions
In vitro data demonstrate that the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant 
plasma concentrations. Thus fesoterodine is unlikely to alter the clearance of medicinal products that 
are metabolised by these enzymes.
CYP3A4 inhibitors
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors
Following inhibition of CYP3A4 by co-administration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily, Cmax and 
AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0 and 2.3-fold in CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolisers and 2.1 and 2.5-fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, respectively. Therefore, the 
maximum dose of fesoterodine should be restricted to 4 mg when used concomitantly with potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir (and all ritonavir boosted PI-regimens), saquinavir and telithromycin (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors
Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 
200 mg twice a day for 2 days, Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 
approximately 19% and 27%, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence 
of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit 
juice).
Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors
The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine), was not examined; it is not expected to be in 
excess of the effect of moderate inhibitor.
CYP3A4 inducers
Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, Cmax and AUC 
of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after 
oral administration of fesoterodine 8 mg.
Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to subtherapeutic plasma levels. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St John’s Wort) is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).
CYP2D6 inhibitors
The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. Mean Cmax and AUC of the active 
metabolite are 1.7 and 2-fold higher, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers as compared to 
extensive metabolisers. Co-administration of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in increased 
exposure and adverse events. A dose reduction to 4 mg may be needed (see section 4.4).
5
Oral contraceptives
Fesoterodine does not impair the suppression of ovulation by oral hormonal contraception. In the 
presence of fesoterodine there are no changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral
contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Warfarin
A clinical study in healthy volunteers has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity of a single dose of warfarin.
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of fesoterodine in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity 
studies with fesoterodine in animals show minor embryotoxicity. In animal reproduction studies, oral 
administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in 
fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD), respectively, based on AUC (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
TOVIAZ is not recommended during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether fesoterodine/metabolites are excreted into human milk; therefore, 
breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with TOVIAZ.
Fertility
No clinical trials have been conducted to assess the effect of fesoterodine on human fertility. Findings 
in mice at exposures approximately 5 to 19 times those at the MRHD show an effect on female 
fertility, however, the clinical implications of these animal findings are not known (see section 5.3). 
Women of child bearing potential should be made aware of the lack of human fertility data, and 
TOVIAZ should only be given after consideration of individual risks and benefits.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
TOVIAZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Caution should be exercised when driving or using machines due to possible occurrence of side effects 
such as blurred vision, dizziness, and somnolence (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety of fesoterodine was evaluated in placebo-controlled clinical studies in a total of 
2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 780 received placebo.
Due to the pharmacological properties of fesoterodine, treatment may cause mild to moderate 
antimuscarinic effects like dry mouth, dry eye, dyspepsia and constipation. Urinary retention may
occur uncommonly.
Dry mouth, the only very common adverse reactions, occurred with a frequency of 28.8% in the 
fesoterodine group compared to 8.5% in the placebo group. The majority of adverse reactions occurred 
during the first month of treatment with the exception of cases classified as urinary retention or post 
void residual urine greater than 200 ml, which could occur after long term treatment and was more 
common in male than female subjects.

Description of selected adverse reactions
In clinical trials of fesoterodine, cases of markedly elevated liver enzymes were reported with the 
occurrence frequency no different from the placebo group. The relation to fesoterodine treatment is 
unclear.
Electrocardiograms were obtained from 782 patients treated with 4 mg, 785 treated with 8 mg, 
222 treated with 12 mg fesoterodine and 780 with placebo. The heart rate corrected QT interval in 
fesoterodine treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo treated patients. The incidence 
rates of QTc  500 ms post baseline or QTc increase of  60 ms is 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.5%, for 
7
fesoterodine 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and placebo, respectively. The clinical relevance of these findings 
will depend on individual patient risk factors and susceptibilities present (see section 4.4).
Post-marketing cases of urinary retention requiring catheterisation have been described, generally 
within the first week of treatment with fesoterodine. They have mainly involved elderly (≥ 65 years) 
male patients with a history consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (see section 4.4).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Overdose with antimuscarinics, including fesoterodine can result in severe anticholinergic effects. 
Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. In the event of overdose, ECG monitoring is 
recommended; standard supportive measures for managing QT prolongation should be adopted. 
Fesoterodine has been safely administered in clinical studies at doses up to 28 mg/day.
In the event of fesoterodine overdose, treat with gastric lavage and give activated charcoal. Treat 
symptoms as follows:
-
-
-
-
-
-
Severe central anticholinergic effects (e.g. hallucinations, severe excitation): treat with 
physostigmine
Convulsions or pronounced excitation: treat with benzodiazepines
Respiratory insufficiency: treat with artificial respiration
Tachycardia: treat with beta-blockers
Urinary retention: treat with catheterisation
Mydriasis: treat with pilocarpine eye drops and/or place patient in dark room.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Urinary antispasmodics, ATC code: G04BD11.
Mechanism of action
Fesoterodine is a competitive, specific muscarinic receptor antagonist. It is rapidly and extensively 
hydrolysed by non-specific plasma esterases to the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, its primary active 
metabolite, which is the main active pharmacological principle of fesoterodine.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The efficacy of fixed doses of fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg was evaluated in two Phase 3 randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. Female (79%) and male (21%) patients with a 
mean age of 58 years (range 19-91 years) were included. A total of 33% of patients were ≥ 65 years of 
age and 11% were ≥ 75 years of age.
Fesoterodine treated patients had statistically significant mean reductions in the number of 
micturitions per 24 hours and in the number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours at the end of 
treatment compared to placebo. Likewise, the response rate (% of patients reporting that their 
condition has been “greatly improved” or “improved” using a 4-point Treatment Benefit Scale) was 
significantly greater with fesoterodine compared to placebo. Furthermore, fesoterodine improved the 
mean change in the voided volume per micturition, and the mean change in the number of continent 
days per week (see Table 1 below).

Cardiac electrophysiology
The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was thoroughly evaluated in a 
double-blind, randomised, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel group 
study with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 45 to 
9
65 years. Change from baseline in QTc based on the Fridericia correction method did not show any 
differences between the active treatment and placebo group.
Paediatric population
Fesoterodine was evaluated in a randomised, open-label study consisting of a 12-week efficacy phase 
study followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in paediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of 
age with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Two cohorts were studied. In the Cohort 1, 124 patients 
weighing > 25 kg received a fixed dose of fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets once-daily or active 
comparator oxybutynin XL tablets. In the safety extension phase, patients randomised to active 
comparator tablets were switched to fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets (allocated by the investigator).
In the Cohort 2, 57 patients weighing ≤ 25 kg received a fixed dose of fesoterodine 2 mg or 4 mg 
investigational beads-in-capsule (BIC) formulation once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients 
continued on the dose of fesoterodine to which they had been randomised. For study inclusion, 
patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or 
urodynamically-demonstrated neurogenic detrusor overactivity (see section 4.2).
The primary efficacy endpoint for both Cohorts was the mean change from baseline in maximum 
cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets 
resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for 
paediatric patients in Cohort 1, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine 8 mg 
tablets than for fesoterodine 4 mg tablets. Treatment with fesoterodine 2 mg and 4 mg BIC resulted in 
improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for paediatric 
patients in Cohort 2, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine 4 mg BIC than 
for fesoterodine 2 mg BIC.

Secondary endpoints
Treatment with fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets resulted in statistically significant improvements in 
the urodynamic measure secondary endpoint bladder volume at first involuntary detrusor contraction. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in the efficacy phase were diarrhoea, dry mouth, 
constipation, abdominal pain (including upper abdominal pain) and headache. These mild to moderate 
adverse reactions are consistent with the pharmacological, antimuscarinic properties of fesoterodine.
Increases in heart rate were observed in patients who received TOVIAZ which were not associated 
10
with clinical symptoms. Overall, the safety profile in paediatric patients with neurogenic detrusor 
overactivity was similar to that observed in adults with overactive bladder syndrome.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
After oral administration, due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by non-specific plasma esterases, 
fesoterodine was not detected in plasma. 
Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of 
fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are 
proportional to the dose. The steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in healthy adult subjects following 
fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarised in Table 3.

Abbreviations: AUCtau,ss = steady-state area under the concentration time curve over the 24 hour dosing interval;
Cmax,ss = steady-state maximum plasma concentration; CV = coefficient of variation; N = number of patients with 
PK data; QD = once daily.
Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. Therapeutic plasma levels are 
achieved after the first administration of fesoterodine. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose 
administration.
Distribution
Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low with approximately 50% bound to albumin and 
alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous 
infusion of the active metabolite is 169 l.
Biotransformation
After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed to its active metabolite. 
The active metabolite is further metabolised in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and 
N-desisopropyl metabolite with involvement of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites 
contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Mean Cmax and AUC of the 
active metabolite are 1.7 and 2-fold higher, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers as compared 
to extensive metabolisers.
Elimination
Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active 
metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was 
recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl 
metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in 
faeces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite following oral administration is approximately 
7 hours and is absorption rate-limited.
Age and gender
No dose adjustment is recommended in these subpopulations. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine 
are not significantly influenced by age and gender.
Paediatric population
11
In paediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with neurogenic detrusor overactivity weighing 
35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metaboliser status receiving fesoterodine tablets, the mean values of 
apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to 
be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The Tmax and half-life of 5-HMT are
estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposure in 
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive
metabolisers.
The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in paediatric patients following 
fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarised in Table 4.

Renal impairment
In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 – 80 ml/min), Cmax and AUC of the active 
metabolite increased up to 1.5 and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients 
with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min), Cmax and AUC are increased 2.0 and 2.3-fold, 
respectively. 
Hepatic impairment
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite 
increased 1.4 and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetics of 
fesoterodine in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
In non-clinical safety pharmacology, general toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies no 
clinically relevant effects have been observed, except those related to the pharmacological effect of the 
active substance.
Reproduction studies have shown minor embryotoxicity at doses close to maternally toxic ones 
(increased number of resorptions, pre-implantation and post-implantation losses).
Supratherapeutic concentrations of the active metabolite of fesoterodine, have been shown to inhibit 
K+ current in cloned human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels and prolong action potential 
duration (70% and 90% repolarisation) in canine isolated Purkinje fibres. However in conscious dogs, 
the active metabolite had no effect on the QT interval and QTc interval at plasma exposures at least 
33-fold higher than mean peak free plasma concentration in human subjects who are extensive 
metabolisers and 21-fold higher than measured in subjects who are poor CYP2D6 metabolisers after 
fesoterodine 8 mg once daily.
12
In a study of fertility and early embryonic development in mice, fesoterodine had no effect on male 
reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of
corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable foetuses was observed in female mice administered 
fesoterodine for 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal 
No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic 
development were both 15 mg/kg/day. Based on AUC, the systemic exposure was 0.6 to 1.5 times 
higher in mice than in humans at the MRHD, whereas based on peak plasma concentrations, the 
exposure in mice was 5 to 9 times higher.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What TOVIAZ is and what it is used for
TOVIAZ contains an active substance called fesoterodine fumarate, and is a so called antimuscarinic 
treatment which reduces the activity of an overactive bladder and it is used in adults to treat the 
symptoms. 
TOVIAZ treats the symptoms of an overactive bladder such as 



not being able to control when you empty your bladder (called urgency incontinence)
suddenly needing to empty your bladder (called urgency)
having to empty your bladder more often than usual (called increased urinary frequency)
2. What you need to know before you take TOVIAZ
Do not take TOVIAZ:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
if you are allergic to fesoterodine or to peanut or soya or to any of the other ingredients of 
TOVIAZ (listed in section 6) (see section 2, “TOVIAZ contains lactose and soya oil”)
if you are not able to completely empty your bladder (urinary retention)
if your stomach empties slowly (gastric retention)
if you have an eye disease called narrow angle glaucoma (high pressure in the eye), which is not 
under control
if you have excessive weakness of the muscles (myasthenia gravis)
if you have ulceration and inflammation of the colon (severe ulcerative colitis)
if you have an abnormally large or distended colon (toxic megacolon)
if you have severe liver problems.
if you have kidney problems or moderate to severe liver problems and are taking medicines 
containing any of the following active substances: itraconazole or ketoconazole (used to treat 
fungal infections), ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, saquinavir or nelfinavir (antiviral medicine
for treating HIV), clarithromycin or telithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections) and 
nefazodone (used to treat depression)
32
Warnings and Precautions
Fesoterodine may not always be suitable for you. Talk to your doctor before taking TOVIAZ, if any of 
the following apply to you:
-
if you have difficulties in completely emptying your bladder (for example due to prostate 
enlargement)
if you ever experience decreased bowel movements or suffer from severe constipation
if you are being treated for an eye disease called narrow angle glaucoma
if you have serious kidney or liver problems, your doctor may need to adjust your dose
if you have a disease called autonomic neuropathy which you notice from symptoms such as 
changes in your blood pressure or disorders in the bowel or sexual function
if you have a gastrointestinal disease that affects the passage and/or digestion of food
if you have heartburn or belching. 
if you have an infection of the urinary tract, your doctor may need to prescribe some antibiotics
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Heart problems: Talk to your doctor if you suffer from any of the following conditions
-
you have an ECG (heart tracing) abnormality known as QT prolongation or you are taking any 
medicine known to cause this
you have a slow heart rate (bradycardia)
you suffer from heart disease such as myocardial ischaemia (reduced blood flow to the heart 
muscle), irregular heartbeat or heart failure
you have hypokalaemia, which is a manifestation of abnormally low levels of potassium in your 
blood.

-
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because it is yet to be 
established whether it would work for them and whether it would be safe.
Other medicines and TOVIAZ
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor will tell you whether you can take TOVIAZ with other medicines.
Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines according to the following list. Taking them at 
the same time as fesoterodine may make side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, difficulty in 
completely emptying your bladder or drowsiness more serious or occur more often.
-
-
medicines containing the active substance amantadine (used to treat Parkinson’s disease).
certain medicines used to enhance gastrointestinal motility or to relieve stomach cramps or 
spasm and to prevent travel sickness like medicines containing metoclopramide.
certain medicines used to treat psychiatric diseases, like anti-depressives and neuroleptics.
-
Please also inform your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:
-
medicines containing any of the following active substances may increase the break-down of 
fesoterodine and thus decrease its effect: St. John’s Wort (herbal medicinal product), rifampicin 
(used to treat bacterial infections), carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital (used, among 
others, to treat epilepsy).
medicines containing any of the following active substances may increase the blood levels of 
fesoterodine: itraconazole or ketoconazole (used to treat fungal infections), ritonavir, atazanavir, 
indinavir, saquinavir or nelfinavir (antiviral medicine for treating HIV), clarithromycin or 
telithromycin (used to treat bacterial infections), nefazodone (used to treat depression),
fluoxetine or paroxetine (used to treat depression or anxiety), bupropion (used for smoking 
cessation or to treat depression), quinidine (used to treat arrhythmias) and cinacalcet (used to 
treat hyperparathyroidism).
medicines containing the active substance methadone (used in the treatment of severe pain and 
abuse problems).

33
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not take TOVIAZ if you are pregnant, as the effects of fesoterodine on pregnancy and the 
unborn baby are not known.
It is not known whether fesoterodine is excreted into human milk; therefore, do not breast-feed during 
treatment with TOVIAZ. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
TOVIAZ can cause blurred vision, dizziness, and sleepiness. If you experience any of these effects, do 
not drive or use any tools or machines.
TOVIAZ contains lactose and soya oil
TOVIAZ contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some 
sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
TOVIAZ contains soya oil. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal product. 
3.
How to take TOVIAZ
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.
The recommended starting dose of TOVIAZ is one 4 mg tablet a day. Based on how you respond to 
the medicine, your doctor may prescribe you a higher dose; one 8 mg tablet a day. 
You should swallow your tablet whole with a glass of water. Do not chew the tablet. TOVIAZ can be 
taken with or without food.
To help you remember to take your medicine, you may find it easier to take it at the same time every 
day.
If you take more TOVIAZ than you should
If you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes 
your tablets, contact your doctor or hospital for advice immediately. Show them your pack of tablets.
If you forget to take TOVIAZ
If you forget to take a tablet, take your tablet as soon as you remember, but do not take more than one 
tablet in one day. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.
If you stop taking TOVIAZ
Do not stop taking TOVIAZ without talking to your doctor, as your symptoms of overactive bladder 
may come back again or become worse once you stop taking TOVIAZ.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
34
Some side effects could be serious
Serious allergic reactions including angioedema occurred rarely. You should stop taking TOVIAZ and 
contact your doctor immediately if you develop swelling of the face, mouth or throat as this may be 
life-threatening.
Other side effects
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)
You may get a dry mouth. This effect is usually mild or moderate. This may lead to a greater risk of 
dental caries. Therefore, you should brush your teeth regularly twice daily and see a dentist when in 
doubt.

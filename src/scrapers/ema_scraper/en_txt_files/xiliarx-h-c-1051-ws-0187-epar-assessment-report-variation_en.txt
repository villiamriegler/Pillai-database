1.   Scientific discussion  
1.1.  Introduction 
Vildagliptin is an oral antidiabetic agent which belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors 
class. It was first granted a positive opinion by the CHMP for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) in combination with metformin, a thiazolidinedione or a sulphonylurea in July 2007, under the 
name Galvus. The marketing authorisation was issued by the EU Commission in September 2007. Two 
additional marketing authorisations were granted in EU for duplicate licenses in November 2008 (Jalra 
and Xiliarx). 
Subsequent  to  the  original  application,  and  as  discussed  in  the  EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/06/G 
Type  II  variation,  the  MAH  (Marketing  Authorisation  Holder)  has  accumulated  additional  safety 
experience  with  vildagliptin  and  has  a  large  pooled  clinical  database,  which  now  includes  information 
from  38  completed  clinical  studies  of  up  to  more  than  2  years  duration.  It  represents  more  than 
11,500 patients treated with vildagliptin (resulting in approximately 9,900 subject years exposure). In 
addition to assessing general safety as well as selected safety  topics of interest, the pooled database 
was  also  utilized  to  conduct  an  extensive  analysis  of  the  safety  of  vildagliptin  in  the  populations  of 
patients  for  which  CHMP  expressed  concerns  originally.  The  company  has  accumulated  more 
experience in CHF patients. In addition the pooled analysis did not reveal any CV (cardiovascular) risk 
with  vildagliptin  relative  to  comparators,  including  on  subgroups  of  patients  at  increased  CV  risk. 
Furthermore, vildagliptin has been extensively studied in patients with renal impairment. The variation 
(EMEA/H/C/771/1048/51/WS/149)  reached  a  positive  opinion  on  the  25th  Oct  2011,  resulting  in 
removal of the restrictions with regards to renal function, recommendations on a reduced posology for 
patients  with  moderate  to  severe  (including  patients  with  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD))  renal 
impairment as well as a wording in section 5.1. Since the use of vildagliptin in renal function has been 
thoroughly  discussed  within  the  scope  of  WS/149,  these  data  is  only  briefly  discussed  within  the 
current procedure. 
These  safety  data,  together  with  the  efficacy  data  on  vildagliptin  as  monotherapy,  as  documented 
during the original application, have been provided in support of the proposed monotherapy indication 
in patients who cannot take metformin. 
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
While  this  is  a  type  II  variation  for  a  new  indication,  it  concerns  the  same  population:  patients  with 
type  2  diabetes  mellitus.  Therefore,  there  is  no  need  to  update  the  ERA.  In  addition,  in  the  original 
MAA,  the  monotherapy  indication  was  included  and  the  ERA  performed  at  that  time  covered  this 
indication.  
1.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
The efficacy of vildagliptin as monotherapy has been established in 5 key studies, 2 placebo-controlled 
and  3  active-controlled  (vs.  metformin,  the  sulphonylurea  (SU)  gliclazide  and  the  thiazolidinedione 
(TZD)  rosiglitazone),  which  were  all  previously  submitted  to  CHMP.  Key  results  of  these  studies  are 
also described in the currently approved SmPC. In addition, 2 active-controlled monotherapy extension

studies  (vs.  metformin  and  rosiglitazone)  are  presented  for  completeness.  Both  were  part  of  prior 
submissions to the CHMP.

1.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted and results 
1.3.1.1.  Placebo-controlled trials 
Table 2 summarizes mean changes in HbA1c from baseline as well as placebo-corrected changes from 
baseline with vildagliptin 50 mg bid in the two 24-week, placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. 
Clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  (vs.  placebo)  reductions  in  HbA1c  were  demonstrated 
with vildagliptin  50  mg  bid  in  both  studies.  HbA1c was  reduced  by  -0.79%  from  a  baseline  of  8.56% 
(placebo-subtracted  reduction  -0.49%)  in  study  2301  and  by  -0.72%  from  a  baseline  of  8.38% 
(placebo-subtracted  reduction  -0.73%)  in  study  2384.  Of  note,  the  placebo  response  reducing  the 
HbA1c  reduction  versus  placebo  seen  in  study  2301  but  not  in study  2384  was  driven  by  a  cohort  of 
newly diagnosed patients being randomized at or soon after diagnosis. 
Vildagliptin 50 mg bid did not cause weight gain in the two studies. Body weight changes from baseline 
were  -  0.3  kg  with  vildagliptin  50  mg  bid  and  -1.4  kg  with  placebo  in  study  2301,  and  these 
were  -0.0 kg  and  -1.4  kg,  respectively,  in  study  2384.  No  hypoglycemic  events  were  reported  with 
vildagliptin 50 mg bid or placebo in either study.

The  two  studies  discussed  above  were  included  and  assessed  within  the  original  MAA.  Both  studies 
included additional arms investigating vildagliptin 50 mg qd and 100 mg qd. The conclusion drawn at 
the time of the MAA was that a clinically relevant effect on HbA1c was achieved with vildagliptin 50 mg 
bid when given as monotherapy. 
1.3.1.2.  Active-controlled trials 
Large active-controlled monotherapy studies evaluated vildagliptin 50 mg bid compared to metformin 
and  a  SU  (gliclazide)  in  studies  of  1  to  2  years  duration.  These  studies  are  summarized  below, 
supporting  the  proposed  positioning  of  vildagliptin  as  monotherapy  in  patients  who  cannot  take 
metformin. 
Comparison to metformin 
Study  2309 compared the effects of 52 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg bid to metformin 
up  to  1000  mg  bid  in  drug-naïve  patients  aged  18  to  78  years  (HbA1c  =  7.5%-11%).  A  total  of  780 
patients were randomized to vildagliptin or metformin in a 2:1 ratio.  
In  the  primary  analysis  population  (ITT),  baseline  HbA1c  averaged  8.7%  in  both  treatment  groups. 
Vildagliptin 50 mg bid significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline (-0.96%). This reduction was attained 
by week 12 and sustained over the 52 week study period. The reduction with metformin (mean dose = 
1988  mg/day  at  final  visit)  was  -1.44%.  The  associated  95%  CI  for  the  between-group  difference  in 
mean change was (0.28%, 0.67%) and non-inferiority at a margin of 0.4% was thus not met. Similar 
results were seen in the PP population, with HbA1c reductions of -1.02% from a baseline of 8.6% with 
vildagliptin and -1.60% from a baseline of 8.8% with metformin (95% CI for between-group difference 
0.36, 0.80). Vildagliptin did not induce weight gain (change from baseline of +0.3 kg; NS), while there 
was  an  expected  decrease  in  body  weight  with  metformin  (-1.9  kg).  The  incidence  of  hypoglycemia 
was  low  in  both  groups:  0.6%  of  patients  receiving  vildagliptin  and  0.4%  of  patients  receiving 
metformin  experienced  one  mild  hypoglycaemic  event  each  and  no  serious  (grade  2)  hypoglycaemic 
events occurred in either group. The proportion of patients experiencing one or more AEs in the SOC of 
GI disorders in the metformin group was twice that in patients receiving vildagliptin, due to a 3-4–fold 
higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  metformin  vs.  vildagliptin  group  reporting  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and flatulence.  
This study, already assessed within the original MAA, showed that although a clinically relevant effect 
on  HbA1c  was  observed  with  vildagliptin  50  mg  bid,  metformin  given  at  adequate  doses  showed  a 
significantly  better  HbA1c  lowering  effect.  Thus  the  primary  target  to  show  non-inferiority  in 
comparison  with  metformin  was  not  met  and  only  a  second  line  indication,  restricted  to  patients 
intolerant  (or  with  contraindications)  to  metformin,  could  be  approvable.  The  rate  of  hypoglaecemic

events  was  comparable  between  treatments,  however,  less  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  were 
observed in the vildagliptin treated patients. 
Study  2309E1  was  a  52  week  extension  to  study  2309.  Of  the  569  patients  completing  the  core 
study,  463  patients  entered  the  extension  study  (305  patients  in  the  vildagliptin  treatment  arm  and 
158 in the metformin treatment group). After 104 weeks of treatment, the adjusted mean change from 
baseline  in  the  primary  analysis  population  (extension  ITT)  was  -0.98%  (baseline  8.4%)  with 
vildagliptin  50  mg  bid  and  -1.49%  (baseline  8.8%)  with  metformin  1000  mg  bid  (p  <  0.001  vs. 
vildagliptin). Comparable results were seen in the extension PP population, with HbA1c reductions of -
1.14%  with  vildagliptin  (baseline  8.4%)  and  -1.54%  with  metformin  (baseline  8.8%,  p=0.002  vs. 
vildagliptin). These  reductions  were  very  similar  to those  reported  after  the  1  year  core  phase  of  the 
study, i.e., both vildagliptin and metformin monotherapy sustained a clinically meaningful decrease in 
HbA1c  throughout  2  years  of  treatment.  Body  weight,  hypoglycemia  and  GI  tolerability  were  also 
comparable to the 1 year data.  
Comparison to SU 
Study  2310  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  active-controlled  study  to  compare  the 
efficacy and safety of long-term treatment (104 weeks) with vildagliptin 50 mg bid to gliclazide up to 
320  mg  daily  in  drug-naïve  patients  with  T2DM  (HbA1c  7.5%-11%).  Eligible  patients  (N=1092)  were 
randomized to vildagliptin or gliclazide in a ratio of 1:1. 
Both  treatment  groups  achieved  clinically  relevant  reductions  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  104 
(endpoint), i.e. -0.47% in the vildagliptin 50 mg bid group and -0.61% in the gliclazide group from a 
mean  baseline  HbA1c  of  8.5%  and  8.7%,  respectively,  in  the  primary  (PP)  analysis  population.  The 
associated 95% CI for the between-group difference in mean change was (-0.06%, 0.33%). The study 
narrowly failed to show non-inferiority at a margin of 0.3% in the analysis at 104 weeks. Vildagliptin 
did  not  induce  relevant  weight  gain  and  vildagliptin-treated  patients  reported  less  hypoglycaemic 
events. There was a distinct increase in body weight in the comparator group (mean +1.6 kg increase 
from  baseline,  compared  to  +0.8  kg  in  the  vildagliptin  group).  The  number  of  patients  who 
experienced  a  hypoglycaemic  event  was  low  across  the  study,  but  was  higher  in  the  gliclazide  group 
(1.7% vs. 0.7% in the vildagliptin group).  
This  study  was  assessed  within  procedure  EMEA/H/C/771/II/04.  It  was  concluded  that  it  failed  to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of vildagliptin compared to gliclazide. The absolute reduction of HbA1c with 
vildagliptin  was  somewhat  lower  compared  to  the  comparator.  Thus,  there  are  indications  that 
vildagliptin may be somewhat less effective compared to SU. A description of this study was included in 
the SPC, section 5.1. Concerning safety, vildagliptin had a hypoglycemia profile superior to that of SU. 
Additional data 
While  no  longer  a  marketed  drug  in  the  EU,  a  24-week  study  (Study  2327)  compared  vildagliptin  50 
mg  bid  to  the  TZD  rosiglitazone  (8  mg  qd).  In  the  primary  analysis  population  (primary  ITT)  mean 
HbA1c reductions were -1.13% with vildagliptin and -1.32% with rosiglitazone from baselines of 8.7%, 
and  statistical  non-inferiority  was  established  at  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.4%.  The  HbA1c 
reductions in the PP population (-1.20% vs. -1.48%) were essentially consistent with those seen in the 
primary  ITT  population,  however,  non-inferiority  was  not  achieved.  Patients  receiving  vildagliptin  50 
mg  bid  experienced  no  weight  gain  (-0.3  kg)  while  those  receiving  rosiglitazone  experienced  a  mean 
increase in weight of + 1.6 kg.

1.3.2.  Discussion on Efficacy 
The  studies  supporting  the  monotherapy  indication  were  already  submitted  in  initial  MAA  and 
subsequent type II variations.   
Two  placebo-controlled  studies  were  included  and  assessed  within  the  original  MAA.  Both  studies 
included additional arms investigating vildagliptin 50 mg qd and 100 mg qd. The conclusion drawn at 
the time of the MAA was that a clinically relevant effect on HbA1c was achieved with vildagliptin 50 mg 
bid when given as monotherapy. 
In a study designed to show non-inferiority for vildagliptin vs metformin (already assessed within the 
original  MAA)  it  was  shown  that,  although  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  HbA1c  was  observed  with 
vildagliptin  50  mg  bid,  metformin  given  at  adequate  doses  showed  a  significantly  better  HbA1c 
lowering effect. Thus the primary target to show non-inferiority in comparison with metformin was not 
met  and  only  a  second  line  indication,  restricted  to  patients  intolerant  (or  with  contraindications)  to 
metformin, could be approvable. In the long-term extension of this study efficacy was maintained over 
the  two-year  study  period  in  both  study  groups.  Hypoglycaemic  events  were  comparable  between 
treatments, however, less gastrointestinal events were observed in the vildagliptin treated group. 
A study designed to show non-inferiority for vildagliptin vs a SU (gliclazide) in drug-naïve patients was 
assessed  within  procedure  EMEA/H/C/771/II/04.  It  was  concluded  that  it  failed  to  demonstrate  non-
inferiority of vildagliptin compared to gliclazide. The absolute reduction of HbA1c with vildagliptin was 
somewhat  lower  compared  to  the  comparator.  However,  the  weight  gain  was  less  pronounced  with 
vildagliptin  and  there  was  a  trend  towards  less  hypoglycaemia  compared  to  gliclazide  treatment.  A 
description of this study was included in the SPC, section 5.1. 
In  a  comparative  study  vs  rosiglitazone,  clinically  relevant  effects  on  HbA1c  were  observed  and 
vildagliptin  was  essentially  weight  neutral.  This  study  failed  to  show  non-inferiority  for  vildagliptin  vs 
rosiglitazone in the PP-population.  
Further to these studies, two new studies investigating the use of vildagliptin in patients with moderate 
to  severe  renal  impairment  have  been  submitted  and  discussed  in  the  recently  finalised  Type  2 
variation  (EMEA/H/C/771/WS/149).  This  variation  reached  a  positive  opinion  on  the  25th  Oct  2011, 
resulting in deletion of the restrictions with regards to renal function, recommendations on a reduced 
posology for patients with moderate to severe (including patients with ESRD) renal impairment as well 
as a wording in section 5.1.  
The efficacy of vildagliptin to lower HbA1c when used as monotherapy has been adequately shown with 
consistent findings of across studies.  In all comparative studies the absolute reduction of HbA1c with 
vildagliptin was lower compared to the comparators, thus only a monotherapy indication restricted to 
the  use  in  patients  intolerant  or  with  contraindications  to  metformin  (including  renal  impairment)  as 
proposed by the MAH is acceptable. 
1.4.  Clinical Safety aspects  
Since  the  original  submission  the  clinical  study  dataset  has  been  expanded,  now  comprising 
information from 38 completed clinical studies of up to more than 2 years duration. It represents more 
than  11,500  patients  treated  with  vildagliptin  (resulting  in  approximately  9,900  subject  years 
exposure) as discussed in the recent Type II variation applications.  
No new safety issues have been identified during PSUR assessments. 
A  detailed  overview  of  the  most  current  analyses  of  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  vildagliptin  is 
presented within the submission of the EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G Type 2 variation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/963014/2011 
Page 6/18
 
 
 
 
A detailed discussion of these data is included in the AR for procedure EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G. It was 
concluded that no new safety signals have been identified.  
Based  on  the  CHMP  assessment  of  the  original  application,  following  safety  aspects  are  particular 
relevance for the proposed 2nd line monotherapy indication: 
  A  review  of  the  safety  of  vildagliptin  in  patients  with  CHF  based  on  the  enlarged  experience  with 
the product in this patient population as well as a summary of the CCV safety of vildagliptin in the 
overall  population  including  patients  at  increased  CV  risk,  to  document  absence  of  a  CV  safety 
signal in the overall population and in particular a high CV risk population. 
The safety analyses in patients with CHF and the CV safety analyses in the overall population are 
based on the pooled dataset described above. 
  A review of the safety of vildagliptin in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.  
The  safety  analyses  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  are  based  on  two  recently 
completed, 
stand-alone 
studies,  which  are  not  part  of 
the  pooled  dataset 
(see 
EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149).  As  a  result  of  the  variation  the  restrictions  previously  given  for 
the treatment of patients with impaired renal function have been removed. A reduced posology (50 mg 
qd)  has  been  amended  for  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal  (including  patients  with  end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD)) impairment.  
1.4.1.  Safety in patients with CHF 
To provide an assessment of the safety of vildagliptin when administered to diabetic patients with CHF, 
an evaluation of the overall AE profile of vildagliptin as well as of AEs related to the CV system in this 
population are presented.  
Patients were considered to have CHF if one or more of the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities)  Preferred  Terms  included  in  the  ‘Level  1  Standardized  MedDRA  Query  (SMQ):  Cardiac 
failure,  narrow  search’  were  present  in  the  medical  history  at  baseline.  Of  note,  patients  with  CHF 
NYHA class III and IV were generally excluded from the clinical studies. 
These analyses were previously presented in the EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G Type II variation application 
and  are  also  outlined  within  current  submission.  For  ease  of  reference,  a  summary  of  the  data  is 
provided below. 
Exposure 
In the original application, a total of 72 patients with a history of CHF were identified in the integrated 
monotherapy and add-on dataset presented, including 43 vildagliptin-treated patients and 29 patients 
in  the  all  comparator  group  (including  14  patients  treated  with  placebo).  Additional  data  from  19 
patients with a history of CHF treated with vildagliptin in Study 2308 were also presented. 
In  the  current  expanded  dataset  (all  studies  [excluding  open-label]  safety  population),  a  total  of  184 
patients  with  a  history  of  CHF  at  study  entry  have  been  identified,  including  131  who  received 
vildagliptin treatment and 53 who received comparator treatment. The majority of vildagliptin patients 
(70%) were treated with the 50 mg bid dose (Table 3).  
Table 3.  Of note, the mean duration of exposure was very similar between the vildagliptin 50 mg bid 
(52.3 weeks) and all comparators (51.5 weeks) groups, allowing for direct comparisons between these 
two tables

The number of patients with CHF is still considered to be limited. 
Demographic and background characteristics 
Compared  to  the  overall  population,  vildagliptin-treated  patients  with  a  history  of  CHF  were  as 
expected  older  (mean  age  =  64  vs.  <56  years),  had  a  somewhat  higher  BMI  (32.9  vs.  31.4  kg/m2) 
and a higher percentage of patients had mild renal impairment (nearly 1/2 vs. approximately 1/3). On 
the other hand, glycaemic control (mean HbA1c = 8.0% vs. 8.2%) and disease duration (mean = 4.9 
vs.  4.2  years)  were  similar  in  the  two  populations.  Overall  similar  baseline  characteristics  were 
observed in the CHF patient group exposed to all comparators.  
Adverse Events 
As shown in Table 4, the overall percentage of CHF patients with any AE was similar for vildagliptin 50 
mg bid (60.4%) and all vildagliptin (61.8%) vs. all comparators (62.3%) and lower than that observed 
with placebo (77.8%). There was no dose-response relationship.  
The distribution of AEs by primary SOC was also similar across groups. The four SOCs with the highest 
incidences  of  AEs  across  treatment  groups  were  ‘Infections  and  Infestations’  (28.6%  with  vildagliptin 
50  mg  bid,  29.0%  with  all  vildagliptin  and  32.1%  with  all  comparators),  ‘Nervous  System  Disorders’ 
(23.1%  with  vildagliptin  50  mg  bid,  24.4%  with  all  vildagliptin  and  20.8%  with  all  comparators), 
‘Gastrointestinal Disorders’ (17.6% with vildagliptin 50 mg bid, 17.6% with all vildagliptin and 13.2% 
with  all  comparators)  and  ‘Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders’  (14.3%  with  vildagliptin 
50  mg  bid,  13.0%  with  all  vildagliptin  and  24.5%  with  all  comparators).  No  meaningful  imbalances 
were  observed  in  the  overall  reporting  rates  of  AEs  under  the  hepatobiliary,  skin  and  vascular  SOCs 
between  vildagliptin  50  mg  bid  and  all  vildagliptin  vs.  all  comparators.  The  most  notable  differences 
were observed in the ‘Investigations’ SOC with incidences of 1.1% for vildagliptin 50 mg bid, 1.5% for 
all  vildagliptin  and  13.2%  for  all  comparators,  mainly  driven  by  differences  in  the  Preferred  Terms  of 
‘blood glucose decreased’ and ‘weight increased’.

Primary system organ classes are presented alphabetically. Preferred terms are sorted within primary system organ class 
alphabetically. A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category 
for that treatment. A patient with multiple AEs within a system organ class is counted only once in the total row. 
Total comparators = placebo plus active comparators. 
CHMP  is  of  opinion  that  due  to  the  small  numbers,  these  data  has  to  be  interpreted  with  caution, 
however, no gross imbalances was observed between vildagliptin treated patients and patients treated 
with  active  comparators.  Notably  the  rate  of  cardiac  adverse  events  was  somewhat  lower  in  the 
vildagliptin treated groups compared to active comparator but higher than placebo (only 18 patients). 
Cardiac (arrhythmic, heart failure-related and ischemic) adverse events 
To further evaluate the effect of vildagliptin on AEs related to the CV system in patients with a medical 
history of CHF, the incidences of selected cardiac (i.e. arrhythmic, heart-failure related, ischemic) AEs 
are presented in Table 1.  
The  analysis  did  not  indicate  an  increased  incidence  of  cardiac  (i.e.  arrhythmic,  heart-failure  related, 
ischemic) AEs with vildagliptin relative to all comparators. 
The incidence of any such AE was slightly lower with vildagliptin 50 mg bid (9.9%) and all vildagliptin 
(8.4%)  than  that  observed  for  all  comparators  (13.2%).  This  was  also  true  for  any  arrhythmic  AEs 
(4.4% with vildagliptin 50 mg bid, 3.1% with all vildagliptin and 9.4% with all comparators) and any 
heart-failure related AEs (6.6% with vildagliptin 50 mg bid, 6.1% with all vildagliptin and 7.5% with all 
comparators). The incidence of ischemic events was similar between vildagliptin 50 mg bid (2.2%), all 
vildagliptin (1.5%) and all comparators (1.9%).

The analysis of AEs by SOC as presented in Table 5-2, also revealed a similar or lower overall incidence 
of AEs in the ‘Cardiac Disorders’ SOC with vildagliptin 50 mg bid (13.2%) and all vildagliptin (10.7%) 
relative to all comparators (15.1%).

CHMP is of opinion that the detailed analysis of cardiac events did not reveal any safety concerns. 
Conclusion 
A  total  of  131  vildagliptin-treated  patients  with  a  history  of  CHF  at  study  entry  were  identified  in  the 
current  dataset  (all  studies  [excluding  open-label]  safety  population).  There  was  no  evidence  of  an 
adverse safety signal in these patients. In particular, analysis of data in patients with documented CHF 
did not indicate an increased incidence of overall AEs or cardiac (i.e. arrhythmic, heart failure-related 
or ischemic) AEs with vildagliptin relative to all comparators. 
The  cardiac  safety  of  vildagliptin  in  patients  with  CHF  is  further  characterized  through  a  prospective 
randomized  safety  study  (Study  23118,  -indicated  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  in  the 
pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP), which is currently ongoing. However, the Company believes that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/963014/2011 
Page 10/18
 
 
 
 
 
the pooled data presented allow for meaningful conclusions before the results of the ongoing study are 
available and support the proposed monotherapy indication. 
As  discussed  in  the  AR  concerning  EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G,  the  analysis  of  data  in  patients  with 
documented  CHF  did  not  indicate  an  increased  incidence  of  overall  AEs  or  cardiac  (i.e.  arrhythmic, 
heart  failure-related  or  ischaemic)  AEs  with  vildagliptin  relative  to  all  comparators.  However,  the 
number  of  patients  was  rather  low,  and  patients  with  CHF  III-IV  were  generally  excluded  from  the 
studies.  The  cardiac  safety  of  vildagliptin in  patients  with  CHF will  be  further  characterized  through  a 
prospective  randomized  safety  study  which is indicated  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  in 
the pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP. 
The  additional  data  is,  however,  considered  sufficient  in  mitigating  the  concerns  raised  during  the 
original  MAA  and  the  limitations  of  the  data  does  not  preclude  the  approval  of  the  monotherapy 
indication.  It  is  proposed  that  the  current  warnings  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  regarding  the  lack  of 
data in patients with CHF are changed to only include patients with NYHA III-IV. The CHMP agreed and 
the SmPC has been updated accordingly. 
1.4.2.  Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety in the overall population 
In  order  to  further  document  the  CCV  safety  of  vildagliptin,  its  CCV  safety  in  the  overall  population 
including  patients  at increased  CV  risk  was  analyzed  and  the  analyses  are  also  in line  with  the  CHMP 
revised  draft  “Note  for  Guidance  of  Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  in  the  Treatment  of 
Diabetes  Mellitus”,  addressing  the  issue  of  CV  assessments  required  for  new  or  recently  approved 
antidiabetic  drugs.  These  analyses  were  presented  in  detail  in  the  EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G  Type  II 
variation  application  and  are  also  outlined  in  the  current  addendum.  This  supportive  information  is 
therefore only briefly summarized hereafter for ease of reference.  
The  population  studied  for  these  analyses  was  representative  of  a  T2DM  population  with  multiple  CV 
risk factors and with ~ 1/6 of patients (N=1438) having a high CV risk status (defined as a previous 
history  of  events  in  the  SMQs  of  cardiac  failure,  embolic/thrombotic  events  arterial,  ischemic  heart 
disease and/or ischemic cerebrovascular conditions). 
Vildagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of confirmed CCV events as adjudicated by a pre-
planned independent Adjudication Committee [i.e. acute coronary syndrome, transient ischemic attack 
(imaging  evidence  of  infarction),  stroke  (ischemic  and  hemorrhagic),  and  CCV  death],  SMQ  MACE 
events  or  Custom  MACE  events  relative  to  all  comparators.  The  risk  ratios  (all  vildagliptin  vs.  all 
comparators)  were  0.84  (adjudicated  CCV  events),  0.82  (SMQ  MACE)  and  0.89  (Custom  MACE), 
respectively.  Furthermore,  these  risk  ratios  for  the  3  endpoints  analyzed  met  the  FDA  guidance 
criterion of an upper limit of the 95% CI less than 1.3.  
Subgroup analyses by age, gender, CV risk status and duration of diabetes were performed to address 
applicability of results in higher CV risk populations. Overall there was no increased risk of adjudicated 
CCV events or MACE events with vildagliptin in these subgroups consistent with the overall result. 
The  analysis above  is  further  supported  by  a  separate  analysis of  arrhythmic,  heart  failure-related  or 
cardiac  ischemic  events,  which  demonstrated  that  vildagliptin  at  the  approved  doses  was  not 
associated with an increased risk relative to all comparators.  
Conclusion 
The  following  assessment  was  made  of  the  CV  data  in  EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G:  The  analyses  of 
adjudicated  CCV  events  (ACS,  TIA  [with  imaging  evidence  of  infarction],  stroke  and  CCV  death)  and 
MACE  (SMQ  or  Custom)  events  demonstrated  that  vildagliptin  was  not  associated  with  an  increased 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/963014/2011 
Page 11/18
 
 
 
 
risk of CCV events relative to all comparators. The incidence of SMQ MACE events was similar between 
the  vildagliptin  50  mg  bid  group  (2.1%)  and  the  all  comparators  group  (2.3%).  The  risk  ratios  (all 
vildagliptin vs. all comparators) for the three endpoints analyzed (adjudicated CCV events, SMQ MACE 
and Custom MACE) met the FDA guidance criterion of an upper limit of the 95% CI less than 1.3. This 
may seem reassuring, however, it should be remembered that  the mean duration of exposure is less 
than 50 weeks and only 16-18% of the population was defined as having high CV risk status. Thus, it 
may be questioned whether this scenario reflects the clinical situation and population.  
Taken  together,  the  data  indicate  that  vildagliptin  is  not  associated  with  an  increased  CV  risk  in  the 
overall population or in subgroups of patients at increased CV risk. 
1.4.3.  Safety in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment 
An  additional  patient  population  of  particular  relevance  in  the  context  of  the  proposed  monotherapy 
indication are patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. 
The  safety  and  tolerability  of  vildagliptin  in  these  patients  has  been  established  in  two  large,  stand-
alone,  24-week  studies  (23137  and  23138).  The  results  of  these  studies  were  recently  submitted  to 
CHMP as part of an application to remove the label restriction for vildagliptin in patients with moderate 
or  severe  renal  impairment  (EMEA/H/C/771/WS/149),  which  reached  a  positive  opinion  in  October 
2011. 
The safety and tolerability of vildagliptin has been studied in 371 patients with moderate (N=165) or 
severe (N=206) renal impairment. In line with the PK data, a dose of 50 mg qd was chosen for these 
studies.  
The  main  study  to  establish  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  vildagliptin  in  patients  with  moderate  and 
severe renal impairment is study 23137, which compared vildagliptin to placebo. Additional supportive 
information  comes  from  study  23138,  which  evaluated  vildagliptin  in  comparison  to  another  DPP-4 
inhibitor, sitagliptin, in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Taken together, the available clinical data from studies 23137 and 23138 demonstrate that vildagliptin 
50 mg qd is well tolerated in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, with no new safety 
signals or unforeseen risks identified. 
The  safety  data  from  studies  23137  and  23138  have  been  thoroughly  discussed  in  the  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/771/WS/149 for which an opinion was adopted in October 2011. It was concluded that the 
safety data provided in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment is considered sufficient to 
recommend treatment in these populations. 
1.4.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, special tests 
No  new  information  has  become  available,  which  would  affect  vildagliptin  use  in  monotherapy 
indication. 
1.4.5.  Safety in special populations 
The  special  patient  populations  of  particular  relevance  in  the  context  of  the  proposed  monotherapy 
indication have been discussed above. 
The  safety  of  vildagliptin 
in  elderly  (≥65  years)  was  assessed 
in  a  type  II  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/771/807/1048/051/1050/1049/WS/70).  It  was  concluded  that  “the  submitted  analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/963014/2011 
Page 12/18
 
 
 
 
support  a  similar  efficacy  in  elderly  patients  compared  to  the  younger  population  with  respect  to 
reduction  of  HbA1c  and  FPG.  The  treatment  was  largely  weight  neutral  and  the  incidence  of 
hypoglycaemia  was  low.  No  other  safety  issues  compared  to  comparators  or  the  younger  population 
were identified.” Thus, it was agreed that the wording in section 4.2 recommending caution in elderly 
patients aged 75 years and older could be removed.  
1.4.6.  Prematurely discontinued and unfinished studies 
No studies were prematurely discontinued. 
Main ongoing studies at the time of this application include a study in T2DM patients with CHF (Study 
23118),  as  discussed  above,  and  two  other  studies  (Study  23152  and  Study  23135).  No  unexpected 
safety events were reported in any of these trials.  
1.4.7.  Post marketing experience 
Long-term use 
Data  from  long-term  studies  with  vildagliptin  did  not  identify  any  particular  safety  signals  or 
unforeseen risks for long-term use, as discussed in the previous Type 2 variation applications and also 
summarized in the current SCS-Addendum. 
Post-marketing experience 
Vildagliptin is currently approved in more than 80 countries worldwide and the fixed dose combination 
of vildagliptin/metformin in more than 75 countries worldwide. 
Based  on  the  sales  data  there  is  a  significant  post-marketing  patient  exposure  to  vildagliptin  and 
vildagliptin/ metformin 
The  safety  of  the  product  is  continuously  monitored  and  reported  to  Health  Authorities  regularly  via 
PSURs. PSUR data continue to support the current assessment of the benefit/risk of vildagliptin. 
Following  a  request  by  the  CHMP  (EMA/549257/2010),  the  MAH  has  recently  conducted  a  thorough 
evaluation  of  all  reports  related  to  liver  dysfunction  received  from  marketed  use  of  vildagliptin 
(including Galvus and Eucreas) since the original placing on the market. The review was assessed in a 
type II variation (EMEA/H/C/771/807/1048/1051/1050/1049/WS/125). Seven cases consistent with a 
drug-related liver event were identified. Based on these cases, the safety information referring to the 
post-marketing  experience  in  section  4.8  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  safety  concern  of  drug-
related liver disease. 
1.4.8.  MAH’s safety conclusions 
Subsequent  to  the  original  application,  the  company  has  accumulated  significant  additional  safety 
experience  in  patients  with  CHF  as  well  as  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  as 
outlined below. 
The  additional  clinical  data,  including  from  long-term  clinical  studies,  demonstrated  in  a  considerably 
enlarged  dataset  that  vildagliptin  is  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  AEs,  including 
cardiovascular  AEs,  relative  to  comparators  in  patients  with  T2DM  and  CHF.  Novartis  acknowledges 
that  the  number  of  patients  with  more  advanced  CHF  (NYHA  class  3  and  4)  recruited  in  clinical  trial 
remains  limited,  which  the  product  label  reflects  (SmPC  Section  4.4),  and  is  confirming  the  safety  of

vildagliptin in patients with CHF in a dedicated clinical study, which is currently ongoing (Study 23118 
indicated  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  in  the  pharmacovigilance  plan  of  the  RMP). 
However,  the  MAH  believes  that  the  available  data  in  patients  with  CHF  are  adequate  to  support  the 
proposed monotherapy indication for the following reasons: 
 
The current analyses in a meaningful number of T2DM patients with CHF do not reveal any safety 
signals for vildagliptin treatment as compared to comparators in this population.  
 
The nature and incidences of cardiovascular AEs in T2DM patients with CHF were similar between 
the vildagliptin and comparators treatment groups.  
 
In  the  overall  population,  vildagliptin  is  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  confirmed  CCV 
events  (as  adjudicated  by  a  pre-planned  independent  Adjudication  Committee)  or  SMQ  /  Custom 
MACE events relative to all comparators, even within sub-populations of patients with high CV risk. 
Of  note,  this  includes  a  subpopulation  of  more  than  1,400  vildagliptin-treated  patients  with  a 
previous  history  of  events  in  the  SMQs  of  cardiac  failure,  embolic/thrombotic  events  arterial, 
ischemic heart disease and/or ischemic cerebrovascular conditions.  
Furthermore,  vildagliptin  has  been  extensively  studied  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Vildagliptin 
was  shown  to  be  efficacious  and  overall  well  tolerated  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal 
impairment, with a positive benefit/risk evaluation in these patient populations at a proposed dose of 
50 mg qd. The observed efficacy with vildagliptin 50 mg qd in patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment was of similar magnitude to that seen with vildagliptin 50 mg bid in the overall population 
with a similar baseline HbA1c range (EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149). The overall safety profile of 
vildagliptin in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment was comparable to placebo, with no 
new  safety  signals  or  unforeseen  risks  identified.  The  data  from  the  two  large  clinical  trials,  in  which 
371  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  were  treated  with  vildagliptin,  have  recently 
been  submitted  to  CHMP  (EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149  Type  2  variation  application),  and 
positive  opinion  was  reached  in  Oct  2011,  removing  restrictions  regarding  the  use  in  patients  with 
renal impairment. 
In  addition,  the  proposed  use  of  vildagliptin  as  2nd  line  monotherapy  in  patients  who  cannot  take 
metformin is further supported as follows. 
  A  restriction  for  vildagliptin’s  use  in  elderly  patients  ≥  75  years  was  removed  in  December  2010 
(CHMP  opinion),  based  on  increased  experience  and  a  favourable  benefit/risk  evaluation  in  this 
patient population. 
  Monotherapy  treatment  with  vildagliptin  50  mg  bid  in  drug-naive  patients  with  T2DM  resulted  in 
statistically significant, clinically relevant and sustained HbA1c reductions across studies in a broad 
type  2  diabetic  population.  Although  vildagliptin  was  less  efficacious  than  metformin  in  a  1  year 
study,  it  demonstrated  a  significantly  better  GI  tolerability  profile.  This  underlies  the  company’s 
proposal  to  register  vildagliptin  as  monotherapy  in  patients  who  cannot  take  metformin  due  to 
intolerance. 
The  robust  efficacy  and  safety/tolerability  data  presented  in  this  application  support  that  vildagliptin 
may constitute a suitable alternative to SU or TZD monotherapy. In this context it is noteworthy that 
the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid as monotherapy was shown to be of similar magnitude to the SU 
gliclazide (although non-inferiority was narrowly missed) in a study of 2 years duration, with clinically 
relevant  advantages,  including  a  low  risk  of  hypoglycemia  and  no  weight  gain.  Vildagliptin  has  also 
been demonstrated to provide comparable efficacy to rosiglitazone in a 24-week study (non-inferiority 
established in the primary analysis population) without the weight gain of the TZD.

Furthermore,  in  addition  to  the  established  safety  and  tolerability  in  the  special  patient  populations 
discussed earlier, the (long-term) safety of vildagliptin alone and in combination with other antidiabetic 
drugs has been demonstrated in a large pool of patients, including data from 38 clinical trials of up to 
more  than  2  years  in  duration,  which  further  support  that  vildagliptin  can  be  used  safely  in  a  broad 
range of T2DM patients. This includes a comprehensive assessment of hepatic safety, which has been 
performed  based  on  data  from  the  extensive  clinical  trial  database  coupled  with  a  review  of  the 
increasing  post-marketing  experience.  These  data,  as  discussed  in  detail  in  previous  submissions, 
support use of vildagliptin at a 50 mg bid regimen in clinical practice.  
Taken together, relevant new information is available, which support a positive benefit/risk for the use 
of  vildagliptin  as  monotherapy  in  T2DM  patients  who  cannot  take  metformin  due  to  intolerance  or 
contraindications. This includes patients with CHF or renal impairment, including elderly patients. 
In  addition,  the  company  proposes  that  the  risk  management  activities  outlined  in  the  RMP  are 
appropriate to ensure a safe use of the product in the new proposed indication. 
1.4.9.  Discussion 
The  studies  supporting  the  monotherapy  indication  were  already  submitted  in  initial  MAA  and 
subsequent type II variations.   
At  the  time  of  the  original  MAA,  the  CHMP  raised  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  vildagliptin  as 
monotherapy  in  patients  with  CHF  since  the  number  of  patients  included  in  the  studies  was  low. 
Further to this, due to lack of data in patients with renal impairment, the use of vildagliptin in patients 
with contraindications to metformin (mainly renal impairment) was not recommendable by the CHMP. 
As  discussed  in  the  AR  concerning  EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G,  the  analysis  of  data  in  patients  with 
documented  CHF  did  not  indicate  an  increased  incidence  of  overall  AEs  or  cardiac  (i.e.  arrhythmic, 
heart  failure-related  or  ischaemic)  AEs  with  vildagliptin  relative  to  all  comparators.  The  number  of 
patients was rather low, and patients with CHF NYHA III-IV were generally excluded from the studies. 
The  detailed  analysis  of  cardiac  events,  however,  did  not  reveal  any  safety  concerns.  The  cardiac 
safety  of  vildagliptin  in  patients  with  CHF  will  be  further  characterized  through  a  prospective 
randomized safety study (LAF237A23118).  
These  additional  data  are  considered  sufficient  in  mitigating  the  concerns  raised  during  the  original 
MAA  and  the  limitations  of  the  available  data  does  not  preclude  the  approval  of  the  monotherapy 
indication. It is proposed that the current warnings in section 4.4 of the SPC regarding the lack of data 
in patients with CHF are changed to only include patients with NYHA III-IV. 
An analysis of CV data was assessed in EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G. It was concluded that the analyses of 
adjudicated  CCV  events  and  MACE  events  demonstrated  that  vildagliptin  was  not  associated  with  an 
increased risk of CCV events relative to all comparators. It should, however, be remembered that the 
mean  duration  of  exposure  is  less  than  50  weeks and  only  16-18%  of  the  population  was  defined  as 
having  high  CV  risk  status.  Although  these  data  may  not  fully  reflect  the  clinical  situation  and  target 
population, there are no signals of a negative effect of vildagliptin on CV safety. 
Further  to  this,  the  safety  of  vildagliptin  in  elderly  (≥65  years)  was  assessed  in  a  type  II  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/771/807/1048/051/1050/1049/WS/70).  It  was  concluded  that  the  submitted  analyses 
support  a  similar  efficacy  in  elderly  patients  compared  to  the  younger  population  with  respect  to 
reduction  of  HbA1c  and  FPG  with  a  similar  safety  profile  in  elderly.  As  a  result  of  this  variation  the 
wording  in  section  4.2  recommending  caution  in  elderly  patients  aged  75  years  and  older  could  be 
removed.

Following  a  request  by  the  CHMP  (EMA/549257/2010),  the  MAH  has  recently  conducted  a  thorough 
evaluation  of  all  reports  related  to  liver  dysfunction  received  from  marketed  use  of  vildagliptin 
(including Galvus and Eucreas) since the original placing on the market. The review was assessed in a 
type II variation (EMEA/H/C/771/807/1048/1051/1050/1049/WS/125). Seven cases consistent with a 
drug-related liver event were identified. Based on these cases, the safety information referring to the 
post-marketing  experience  in  section  4.8  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  safety  concern  of  drug-
related liver disease. 
Additional  safety  data  from  two  studies  in  a  total  of  371  patients  with  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment has recently been assessed in variation EMEA/H/C/771/WS/149. It was concluded that the 
safety  profile  did  not  appear  different  in  this  population  compared  to  the  overall  population  when  a 
reduced  posology  of  50  mg  qd  was  applied.  As  a  result  of  this  variation  the  restrictions  previously 
given for the treatment of patients with impaired renal function have been removed. 
The  additional  safety  data  obtained  after  the  initial  approval  of  vildagliptin  is  considered  sufficient  in 
addressing  the  concerns  raised  regarding  the  use  of  vildagliptin  in  patients  with  CHF  and  renal 
impairment. It is proposed that the warnings regarding patients with CHF included in section 4.4 of the 
SPC is changed to only include patients with NYHA III-IV due to lack of data in this patient group. 
1.5.  Risk management plan 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information.  
In  addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant  should  take  the  following  minor  points  into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
The MAH should consider removing patients with moderate or  severe renal impairment,  patients with 
compromised  cardiac  function  (NYHA  functional  class  I-II)  and  elderly  patients  from  the  “missing 
information”  section.  Furthermore,  drug-induced  liver  injury  should  be  escalated  from  an  “important 
potential  risk”  to  an  “important  identified  risk”  and  RMP  should  be  updated  with  additional  data 
regarding the safety of DDP-4 inhibitors in patients with cardiovascular disease. 
1.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
 4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
As monotherapy 
- 
in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin 
is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.

Adults 
When  used  as  monotherapy  or  in  dual  combination  with  metformin  or  a  thiazolidinedione,  the 
recommended daily dose of vildagliptin is 100 mg, administered as one dose of 50 mg in the morning 
and one dose of 50 mg in the evening. 
[…] 
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  requested  further  amendments  to  the  PI  as  discussed  in  detail  in 
section  2.4.1  Safety  in  patients  with  CHF.  The  following  additional  amendments  to  the  PI  have  been 
accepted by the CHMP: 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
[…] 
Cardiac failure 
Experience  with  vildagliptin  therapy  in  patients  with  congestive  heart  failure  of  New  York  Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class I-II is limited and therefore  vildagliptin should be used cautiously 
in  these  patients.  There  is  no  experience  of  vildagliptin  use  in  clinical  trials  in  patients  with  NYHA 
functional class III-IV and therefore use is not recommended in these patients. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  which 
were accepted by the CHMP. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The  present  variation  aims  at  providing  overview  of  safety  and  efficacy  data  in  support  of  a 
monotherapy  indication  in  patients  for  whom  metformin  is  inappropriate  due  to  intolerance  (i.e. 
including  patients  with  GI  side-effects)  or  contraindications  (i.e.  including  patients  with  CHF  or  renal 
impairment). No new data have been submitted, but all data have been previously assessed either in 
the original MAA or in subsequent procedures. 
The efficacy of vildagliptin to lower HbA1c when used as monotherapy has been adequately shown in 
two  placebo-controlled  studies  and  three  studies  with  active  comparator.  The  results  were  consistent 
across  studies  showing  a  placebo-corrected  0.49-0.73  %  lowering  of  HbA1c  over  24  weeks.    In  the 
active comparator studies the HbA1c decreased with 0.47 to 1.13 % (study durations between 24 and 
104  weeks).  In  all  comparative  studies  the  absolute  reduction  of  HbA1c  with  vildagliptin  was  lower 
compared to the comparators. In the study where vildagliptin was compared to metformin, significantly 
better results were observed with metformin, thus only a monotherapy indication restricted to the use 
in  patients  intolerant  or  with  contraindications  to  metformin  (including  renal  impairment)  could  be 
acceptable. 
Compared to metformin, vildagliptin shows a more favourable profile when it comes to gastrointestinal 
side effects, whereas hypoglycaemic events were essentially similar and uncommon in both treatment 
groups. When compared to SU, vildagliptin treated patients report less hypoglycaemias and vildagliptin 
is essentially weight neutral whereas weight gain is observed in SU treated patients. 
The  CHMP  safety  concerns  regarding  treatment  of  patients  with  CHF  and  renal  impairment  have  now 
been addressed. More data is now available in patients with CHF and no safety signals have emerged. 
It should be noted that the data presented only concerns patients with verified CHF. It should be taken 
into  account 
that  most 
likely 
the 
treated  T2DM  population  do 
include  a  number  of 
unidentified/undiagnosed  patients  with  CHF.  Accumulated  data  on  CV  risks  with  vildagliptin  in  the 
overall  study  population,  now  comprising  over  11,500  patients,  has  also  been  provided  and  although 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/963014/2011 
Page 17/18
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these data may not fully reflect the clinical situation and target population (due to short duration and a 
relatively low rate of patients at high CV risk), there are no signals of a negative effect of vildagliptin 
on CV safety. 
Further  to  this,  safety  data  in  elderly  patients  have  been  assessed  and  the  recommendation  on 
cautious use of vildagliptin in this patient group has been removed from the SPC. 
The  additional  safety  data  obtained  after  the  initial  approval  of  vildagliptin  is  considered  sufficient  in 
mitigating  the  concerns  raised  regarding  the  use  of  vildagliptin  in  patients  with  CHF  and  renal 
impairment.  The  warnings  regarding  patients  with  CHF  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  has  been 
changed to only include patients with NYHA III-IV due to lack of data in this patient group. 
In conclusion, the benefit risk balance for vildagliptin as monotherapy in patients intolerant to or with 
contraindications to metformin is considered positive by the CHMP.

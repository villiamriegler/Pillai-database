1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder, Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, (MAH) submitted to the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) on 7 November 2002 an application for a grouping of variations in accordance 
with Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, consisting of an extension of the 
marketing authorisation, a Type II C.1.6a variation and a Type II C.I.4 variation for EMEND. 
The MAH applied for an extension of the marketing authorisation consisting of the addition of a new 
pharmaceutical form (powder for oral suspension ) to support the extension of the target population 
covered by the authorised therapeutic indication for EMEND to treat paediatric patients aged 6 months 
to 11 years with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), grouped with a variation to 
extend the indication for CINV to paediatric patients aged 12 to 17years for 80mg and 125mg hard 
capsules, and a variation to reflect the paediatric results for prevention of post-operative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV) for 40mg hard capsules. 
The applicant applied for the following indication for 125mg powder for oral suspension:  
• 
Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic 
chemotherapy in children, toddlers and infants from the age of 6 months to less than 12 years. 
EMEND powder for oral suspension is given as part of combination therapy (see section 4.2). 
For the approved 80mg and 125mg hard capsules, the applicant requested the following variation: 
•  Update of section 4.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to extend the 
indication for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adults to paediatric 
patients (12 to 17years) for 80mg and 125mg hard capsules. The MAH updated section 4.2 of 
the SmPC with dose recommendation for the use 80mg and 125mg capsule strengths in the 
paediatric population.  
Sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1of the SmPC were also updated to include relevant information about 
a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study that included 302 
children and adolescents (aged 6 months to 17years) receiving moderately or highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy, in which aprepitant was compared to a control regimen for the 
prevention of CINV. Section 5.3 of the SmPC was updated to reflect the non-clinical 
investigations performed for the paediatric development program. 
As a consequence, SmPC section 4.2 of 165mg hard capsules was updated to reflect that other 
pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this population 
as in accordance with the current SmPC guideline. SmPC section 5.3 of the 165mg hard 
capsules was also updated to reflect the conclusions of the juvenile toxicity studies. 
The applicant applied for the following indication for 80mg and 125mg hard capsules:  
• 
Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly and moderately emetogenic cancer 
chemotherapy in adolescents from the age of 12 through 17 years. 
For the approved 40mg hard capsules, the applicant requested the following variation: 
EMEND 
Assessment report

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) continues to be one of the most undesirable side 
effects in subjects receiving chemotherapy. In addition to lowering the quality of life for subjects, CINV 
can potentially delay or reduce the dosage of planned chemotherapy regimens for subsequent cycles 
and may result in a reduction in the number of planned cycles.  
In adults, aprepitant administered concomitantly with a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid regimen 
is considered the standard of care and recommended by the Multinational Association of Supportive 
Cancer Care (MASCC)/ European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the prevention of 
nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and selected MEC regimens 
For children undergoing chemotherapy, current MASCC/ESMO, and ASCO guidelines recommend the 
use of a 5-HT3 antagonist, such as ondansetron, and a corticosteroid to alleviate nausea and vomiting 
associated with emetogenic chemotherapy. However, despite the widespread use of these agents, 
nausea and vomiting continue to occur and remain a major source of distress for children undergoing 
emetogenic chemotherapy. Thus, there is an ongoing need to evaluate antiemetic agents, such as 
aprepitant, in alleviating CINV in children receiving emetogenic chemotherapy. 
About the product 
EMEND (aprepitant, MK-0869) is a substance P (NK1 receptor) antagonist, which in combination with 
other antiemetic agents, is indicated for prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in 
adults. EMEND is previously available as 40 mg hard capsules, currently indicated for prevention of 
post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in adults, and as 80 mg, 125 mg and 165 mg hard 
capsules currently indicated for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in 
adults.  
The approved adult dosage is:  
EMEND 40 mg capsules (PONV): A single 40 mg dose within 3 hours prior to induction of anaesthesia 
EMEND 80 mg and 125 mg capsules (CINV): EMEND is given for 3 days as part of a regimen that 
includes a corticosteroid and a 5-HT3 antagonist. The recommended dose is 125 mg orally once daily 
one hour before start of chemotherapy on Day 1 and 80 mg orally once daily on Days 2 and 3 in the 
morning.  
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 6/100 
 
 
 
EMEND 165 mg capsules (CINV): A single 165 mg dose is given on Day 1 only, approximately one hour 
before the start of chemotherapy, as part of a regimen that includes a corticosteroid and a 5-HT3 
antagonist 
EMEND is not previously approved for paediatric patients (< 18 years).

Line extension 
This grouped variation application includes an extension application for a new paediatric formulation, a 
125 mg Powder for oral suspension, intended for prevention of CINV in children 6 months – 11 years of 
age.  
The reconstituted oral suspension has an aprepitant concentration of 25 mg/ml.  
The proposed dose of the oral suspension for children 6 months to 11 years of age is: 
EMEND is given for 3 days as part of a regimen that includes a 5-HT3 antagonist. The recommended 
dose of EMEND powder for oral suspension is based on weight, as specified in a dose nomogram in 
section 4.2 of the SPC. EMEND is administered orally 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Days 1, 2 and 3. 
If no chemotherapy is given on Days 2 and 3, EMEND should be administered in the morning. See the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing 
information. If a corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, is co-administered with EMEND, the dose of 
the corticosteroid should be administered at 50% of the usual dose (see section 5.1).  
The paediatric indication for the new oral suspension is supported primarily by Study 208.  
Extension of indication for the 80 mg and 125 mg capsules 
This grouped variation also includes an extension of the indication for the previously approved 80 mg 
and 125 mg capsules to include Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly and 
moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adolescents from the age of 12 through 17 years.  
The proposed dose to adolescents is:  
EMEND is given for 3 days as part of a regimen that includes a 5-HT3 antagonist. The recommended 
dose of capsules of EMEND is 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg orally on Days 2 and 3. EMEND is 
administered orally 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Days 1, 2 and 3. If no chemotherapy is given on 
Days 2 and 3, EMEND should be administered in the morning. See the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for the selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information. If a 
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, is co-administered with EMEND, the dose of the corticosteroid 
should be administered at 50% of the usual dose (see section 5.1). 
The extension of indication is supported primarily by Study 208.  
Other variation 
This grouped variation also includes update of the SmPCs for the approved EMEND capsules as follows:  
80 and 125 mg capsules: Include new paediatric information in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. These 
changes are based primarily on CINV paediatric studies 208 (pivotal efficacy/safety study), 134 and 
097.  
40 mg capsule: Update SmPC section 5.1 and 5.2 with results from study 148 for paediatric patients 6 
months to 17 years in PONV. These data are not sufficient to support safe and effective use for the 
prevention of PONV across paediatric population. Therefore, the MAH does not intend to seek an 
indication in this application. 
All capsules (40 mg, 80mg, 125 mg and 165 mg): SmPC section 5.3 update in order to reflect the 
conclusions of the two new juvenile toxicity studies for all capsule strengths  
165 mg hard capsule: Update section 4.2 with a standard sentence as per current SmPC guideline.

and in children, respectively. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for oral suspension containing 125 mg of aprepitant as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: hydroxypropylcellulose (E 463), sodium laurilsulfate (E 487), sucrose, lactose 
(anhydrous), red iron oxide (E 172) and sodium stearyl fumarate (E 485), as described in section 6.1 
of the SmPC. 
The product is available in PET/aluminium/LLDPE sachets. The product is provided with one 5 ml 
polypropylene oral dispenser with silicone o-ring and one polypropylene mixing cup, as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
No new information has been presented with regard to the active substance aprepitant and therefore 
no further assessment has been performed within this line extension application. The proposed daily 
dose (125 mg) is the same as the maximum daily dose for the capsules, so no additional requirements 
for impurities in the active substance specification are needed. The proposed specification of the active 
substance in relation to the new pharmaceutical form is the same as for the capsules. As the first step 
of the manufacturing process of the powder for oral suspension is the same as for the capsules, the 
current specification of the active substance is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a dosage form capable of providing 
dosing flexibility and convenient administration for use in paediatric patients as an alternative to the 
existing capsule formulation. Acceptable taste was also important considering the intended age group 
of 6 months to 12 years of age.  
A powder for oral suspension has been developed which utilizes the same aprepitant colloidal 
dispersion intermediate which is used in the manufacture of the capsule formulations.  
EMEND powder for oral suspension 125 mg is supplied as a sachet containing the lubricated blend for 
reconstitution in water. The sachet contains 125.0 mg of aprepitant in 748.7 mg (theoretical weight) of 
powder.  
Due to the low aqueous solubility of the active substance, the product development focused on 
decreasing the active substance particle size to nanoscale in order to enhance the bioavailability of the 
active substance. Thus, the product manufacture was based on the current formulation intermediate 
(aprepitant colloidal dispersion) and a powder for oral suspension formulation was developed for 
paediatric patients which allows for weight based dosing flexibility to properly address this age range. 
The powder for oral suspension formulation consists of the aprepitant colloidal dispersion coated onto 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 9/100 
 
 
 
 
the lactose substrate. The substrate for the capsules is microcrystalline cellulose; however, in order to 
achieve an acceptable taste, several soluble substrates were investigated. The choice of anhydrous 
lactose was justified.  
The coating process focused on fluid bed coating to maintain similarity to the commercial process 
applied for the capsules. The goal of the fluid bed coating process and formulation development was to 
ensure a robust coating process that gave a soluble coated particle. Developmental batches were 
characterised for assay, PSD, and nanoparticle re-dispersion. 
The excipients were selected based on the following considerations: provide satisfactory suspension 
performance, provide appropriate process robustness for the formulation, and ensure acceptable 
palatability/appearance of the formulation during dosing.  
The excipients of the formulation are completely soluble in water, resulting in a nanosuspension with 
acceptable mouth feel. In addition, the insoluble nature of aprepitant and the addition of sucrose 
(redispersant/binder) and lactose (substrate) to the formulation results in a formulation with 
acceptable taste. The proposed formulation for the powder for oral suspension allows for convenient 
and simple dose adjustment via an oral syringe. 
The formulation contains 16.7% sucrose and 62.6% lactose corresponding to a daily dose of 0.125 g 
sucrose and 0.47 g lactose per day for a 30 kg child. This is considered acceptable for a medicinal 
product which is administered for three days in connection with chemotherapy treatment. Regarding 
the other excipients no specific risks related to the paediatric population are foreseen.  
The homogeneity of the suspension and PSD of the active substance after reconstitution and the risk of 
segregation of the aprepitant particles in-use have been evaluated. It was concluded that the 
suspension is homogeneous after reconstitution and remains homogeneous up to 8 hours of storage. 
No segregation was observed.  
Some slight differences in the formulations used in clinical studies have been presented. However the 
bioavailability of aprepitant is driven by the PSD of aprepitant and thus the exposure of the powder for 
oral suspension is expected to be equivalent to EMEND capsules. The control of PSD is included as an 
in-process control (IPC) tested near the end of media milling and as lubricated blend release 
specification.  
Clinical batches were initially manufactured at a smaller scale. Process development activities were 
conducted at different scales. A summary and comparison of the equipment and scale used during 
development and for the proposed commercial manufacturing process has been presented and is 
deemed satisfactory. 
A risk-based approach was taken for the development of the manufacturing process to consistently 
provide a final product of acceptable quality and stability for patient safety and efficacy. The finished 
product has been designed to meet the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of identity, appearance, API 
content uniformity and assay, degradants/impurities, aprepitant PSD, and sachet hold-up and dosing. 
An overview of the manufacturing process development program was presented. The initial FMEA risk 
assessment indicated that content uniformity and assay are the CQA with the highest potential risk, 
and helped to identify the process steps requiring further understanding and characterisation. 
Development studies indicated that lubricated blend particle size distribution (PSD) may directly impact 
segregation risk and content uniformity. To minimise these risks, fluid bed coating focused on 
minimising spray drying and granulation. Through development activities, additional process 
understanding and controls were implemented that either eliminated or mitigated the risks identified in 
the initial risk assessment. 
After the completion of the development campaign, process characterization studies were transferred 
to the proposed commercial site. An updated risk assessment was completed which focused on the 
potential product impacts created by the change in equipment and scale at the commercial site. A 
series of development batches were run at the proposed commercial site. 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 10/100 
 
 
 
Finally a development campaign was executed at the commercial site on the commercial fluid bed 
column and scale. These batches focused on the potential impact created by the change in fluid bed 
scale. A summary and comparison of the equipment and scale used during manufacturing process 
development was presented.  
Due to an expected low assay from the fluid bed coating process it has been justified that the target 
sachet fill weight will be adjusted for each batch based on the actual assay of the lubricated blend.  
A bulk hold time study was initiated for the final blend using small scale containers to represent 
commercial bulk drums and based on the results the proposed bulk hold time of 12 months in HDPE 
bulk drums is considered acceptable.  
The container closure system is a heat sealed foil laminate sachet. An extractable assessment of the 
sachet laminate confirmed no safety concerns with regards to volatile leachables after sealing. 
The finished product commercial configuration further comprises the following components necessary 
to prepare and administer doses: a mixing cup and a graduated 5 ml oral dispenser (syringe). The 
mixing cup is made of polypropylene which meets regulatory and compendial requirements, and has 
an attached tight-fitting hinged lid that is snapped into place to seal the mixing cup.  Since the mixing 
cup does not meet the definition of a medical device under Article I of Directive 93/42/EEC and does 
not have a specific medical purpose, it would not be regulated as a medical device and does not 
require a CE Mark. The material meets food contact EC Regulation 10/2011/EC and 1935/2004. 
Compatibility studies and in-use testing have demonstrated acceptable compatibility with the 
formulation. 
The oral dispenser is a Class I medical device (as defined in EC Directive 93/42/EEC) with measuring 
function, marked with CE Mark. The graduation marks printed on the dispenser correspond to all doses 
in the dosing table in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The dispenser’s components are the barrel, plunger rod, 
and O-ring. The barrel is composed of polypropylene and lubricated with silicone fluid. The plunger rod 
is composed of polypropylene and a white colorant. The barrel and plunger rod meet the appropriate 
European Directives including Regulation EU 10/2011 and EU 1935/2004/EC. The silicone fluid 
complies with European Pharmacopoeia monograph “Dimethicone or Silicone Oil Used as a Lubricant”. 
The o-ring is moulded from silicone and meets appropriate Ph. Eur. requirements and European 
Directives, including Regulation EU 10/2011. 
Dose accuracy for the dosing syringe has been demonstrated with both water and finished product in 
accordance with Ph. Eur. monograph 2.9.27, “Uniformity of Mass of Delivered Doses from Multidose 
Containers”. It has been also demonstrated that the dosing instructions would yield accurate and 
reproducible results. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process includes the manufacture of the aprepitant colloidal coating dispersion as 
described in the current MAA for EMEND capsules. The main manufacturing steps are: preparation of 
the aprepitant colloidal coating dispersion, screening (pre-sieving) of lactose, fluid bed coating, 
delumping, blending, sachet filling and secondary packaging.  
Critical steps of the process have been identified and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for relevant 
process parameters have been set. The proposed IPCs are considered adequate and the overall control 
strategy is deemed sufficient so that the product meets the CQAs.  
According to Annex II of the process validation guideline, this type of product is not explicitly 
considered as a specialised pharmaceutical dose form, however the list of examples in the guideline is 
non exhaustive. Despite the fact that the coating layer is non-functional, it does contain the active 
substance, which renders it critical and more likely to give rise to scale up difficulties and therefore this 
type of process requires particular attention and should be designated as non-standard process.

Nevertheless the experience of the applicant/ manufacturer with this type of process, being already 
used to manufacture the authorised EMEND capsules (albeit with a different substrate, i.e. 
microcrystalline cellulose instead of lactose) has been taken into account.  
Furthermore, details on several clinical, stability and development batches manufactured with the 
indicated process were provided. Additional batch data presented on five commercial scale fluid bed 
batches showed that the particle size, blend uniformity and assay are comparable to the presented 
development batches. When further processed (filling in sachets), the results showed assay and 
content uniformity results compliant with the specification.  The applicant further provided an 
acceptable validation protocol outlining the formal process validation studies which will be conducted 
on production scale batches before marketing of the product. 
Based on historical data, the amount of knowledge gained during the development of the product, and 
the experience of the applicant/ manufacturer with this type of process, it has been adequately 
justified that the process is standard for the proposed manufacturer.  Considering the overall data and 
justifications the manufacturing process is considered sufficiently validated at the commercial scale.   
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specification include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identity (HPLC-DAD, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), time for constitution and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
A dissolution specification for the finished product was not included in the proposed specification on the 
basis that the solubilisation of the aprepitant active substance occurs instantaneously and that the 
product dispersion in water is controlled by time for constitution testing at release and shelf life. In 
addition the critical quality attribute for bioavailability is the particle size distribution and not API 
solubility. 
Given that the packaging is considered moisture impermeable, the product is considered chemically 
stable, and since the product is manufactured at controlled relative humidity, monitoring water activity 
at release and shelf-life is not required. Also omission of pH testing has been justified based on batch 
data.  
Batch analysis results were provided for three commercial scale batches and five smaller scale 
development batches from a different manufacturer confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 12 
months at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are representative to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for 
appearance, assay, dedradation products and time for constitution. In addition to the release 
specification test methods, dissolution, water activity, pH, particle size distribution, moisture and 
microbial quality were evaluated during the formal stability studies. The analytical procedures for assay 
and degradation products used were shown to be stability indicating.  
Results for assay under the long term conditions were found around (or above) the upper limit because 
these batches were manufactured near the upper bound limit, and due to analytical variability; the 
observed values were not the result of a stability trend. This issue was sufficiently addressed and 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 12/100 
 
 
 
 
corrected by using the actual batch assay for fill weight. Batches produced later at commercial scale 
and equipment and after applying the proposed target sachet fill weight adjustment showed results 
ranging from 98.6% to 100.5 %, thus providing confidence that the proposed shelf-life acceptance 
criteria of 95.0% to 105.0% will be met.  
Results on water activity are in-line with the packaging environmental control and confirm that the 
proposed commercial packaging provides sufficient moisture protection for the product. 
All other results complied with the proposed specification. No trends were seen and no degradation 
products were observed above the reporting threshold.  
In-use stability 
In-use stability was evaluated by reconstituting the powder to oral suspension as per the SmPC 
instructions and holding the suspension in the sample cup for five hours under ambient light, 
temperature and humidity conditions. No trend was seen for assay, degradation products or 
suspension particle size. All results confirm an in-use stability of 30 minutes (SmPC section 6.3). 
Photo-stability 
EMEND powder for oral suspension is packaged in a foil sachet. Since this packaging is impervious to 
light, photo stability was not performed for this product. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without any special 
temperature storage conditions but with recommendation to store in the original package in order to 
protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Aprepitant (EMEND™) is a selective, high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) 
receptors that, in combination with other antiemetic agents including a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and 
a corticosteroid, is approved for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting due to 
highly emetogenic and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults (CINV-HEC and CINV-
MEC, respectively).  
In support of the new pediatric indication the Applicant has submitted two juvenile toxicity studies on 
aprepitant (EMEND™, oral administration) in juvenile rats and two juvenile toxicity studies on 
fosaprepitant (IVEMEND™, intravenous administration) in juvenile dogs. The studies on fosaprepitant 
are submitted because fosaprepitant is rapidly dephosphorylated in vivo to the active moiety 
aprepitant. No new nonclinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to 
support the marketing application for use of aprepitant in paediatrics and only an integrated summary 
is presented. 
An ERA including the pediatric population has also been submitted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Results of the nonclinical pharmacology studies with aprepitant and fosaprepitant were previously 
submitted and reviewed as part of initial and supplemental marketing applications for use of aprepitant 
in adults. No new nonclinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to support the marketing 
application for use of aprepitant in paediatrics. 
Aprepitant is a high affinity, selective NK1 receptor antagonist that penetrates the CNS and has long 
central duration of activity. Aprepitant has excellent functional selectivity at NK1 receptors in vitro and 
in vivo against substance P challenges. Extensive cross screening revealed no significant off target 
activities of aprepitant or its metabolites, which suggests that the pharmacological activity observed in 
vivo is likely attributable to NK1 receptor antagonism. Importantly, no activity was detected at 
previously recognized sites (5-HT3 and dopamine D2 receptors) for anti-emetic activity. Aprepitant has 
excellent efficacy against acute and delayed cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Results of the nonclinical pharmacokinetics studies with aprepitant and fosaprepitant were previously 
submitted and reviewed as part of initial and supplemental marketing applications for use of aprepitant 
in adults. No new nonclinical pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted to support the marketing 
application for use of aprepitant in pediatrics. 
The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant has been evaluated thoroughly in the rat and dog. Aprepitant is a 
low (dog, mouse) to moderate (rat) clearance compound in nonclinical species, with a plasma half-life 
of approximately 3 hours in rodents and approximately 7 hours in dogs. The plasma half-life in humans 
ranges from approximately 9 to 13 hours. In rats, dogs, and humans, aprepitant is cleared via 
metabolism and excretion of metabolites into urine and bile (or feces when bile was not collected). The 
major routes of metabolism involve a variety of primary and secondary oxidation pathways that lead to 
the formation of multiple metabolites. All metabolites observed in humans were detected in rats, mice, 
and/or dogs. CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for the oxidative metabolism of aprepitant in human liver 
microsomes. Aprepitant is a weak or a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 using different probe reactions 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 14/100 
 
 
 
(IC50 or Ki values 2 to 21 µM) but a weak inhibitor (IC50 and Ki values >10 µM) of other CYP enzyme 
mediated reactions in human liver microsomes. 
Systemic exposure multiples are based on the exposure in pediatric patients 6 months to <12 years of 
age (AUC0-24hr = 20.9 µg•hr/mL). This exposure is similar to the exposure in adult patients for the 3-
day aprepitant 125/80/80 mg regimen (AUC0-24h = 19.6 µg•hr/mL and 21.2 µg•hr/mL on Day and 
Day 3, respectively). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Aprepitant has a low order of acute toxicity following oral administration to rodents (approximate LD50 
>2000 mg/kg). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The primary treatment-related findings in the adult rat repeated-dose toxicity studies were in the liver 
and/or thyroid (e.g., hepatocellular hypertrophy, thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia), and were 
considered secondary to hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzyme induction. In rodents, aprepitant has been 
shown to induce hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, to increase the rate of thyroxine clearance, and 
to induce its own metabolism. Similar changes in the liver and thyroid have been seen with structurally 
and pharmacologically dissimilar compounds that have been shown to induce hepatic P-450 enzymes. 
These rodent-specific findings are of limited toxicological significance to human risk assessment. 
Systemic exposures to aprepitant in these studies were approximately 2-fold (female rats) or lower 
than (male rats) the exposure at the recommended pediatric dose. The high dose used in these studies 
was the maximum feasible dose. 
In repeated-dose toxicity studies in dogs with aprepitant, systemic exposure to aprepitant at the NOEL 
was approximately 13-fold the exposure at the recommended pediatric dose. The primary changes 
noted in dogs (significant decreased body weight gain or body weight loss, testicular degeneration, and 
prostatic atrophy) occurred at systemic exposures >30-fold the exposure at the recommended 
pediatric dose, and are of minimal toxicological significance to human risk assessment.  
Genotoxicity 
Aprepitant was shown to be neither mutagenic nor genotoxic in assays conducted to detect  
mutagenicity, DNA strand breaks, and chromosomal aberrations. 
Carcinogenicity 
Although carcinogenicity studies are not required for a CINV indication due to the limited and episodic 
duration of patient treatment, studies in mice and rats were conducted up to the maximum feasible 
dose to support other potential therapeutic indications. Treatment-related neoplastic changes were 
limited to increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas (mice and rats) and 
thyroid follicular cell adenomas and/or carcinomas (rats). These findings in the liver and/or thyroid 
were considered to be secondary to hepatic P-450 enzyme induction. This tumor promotion 
phenomena observed in rodents caused by hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzyme inducers has not been 
shown to occur in humans. Systemic exposures to aprepitant in these studies were up to 
approximately 3-fold higher (mice), approximately 1.5-fold (female rats), or less than (male rats) the 
exposure at the recommended pediatric dose. 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 15/100 
 
 
 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Aprepitant had no effects on female or male fertility in rats at systemic exposures approximately 1.5-
fold (females) or less than (males) the exposure at the recommended pediatric dose. Aprepitant was 
not teratogenic nor did it cause any embryo-fetal toxicity in rats or rabbits at doses in which 
transplacental exposures were demonstrated. Maternal systemic exposures were approximately 1.3-
fold the exposure at the recommended pediatric dose. In addition, no effects on pre- and post-weaning 
development of the F1 generation were seen in rats. Significant lactational transfer of aprepitant was 
demonstrated. 
Juvenile toxicity studies 
Study TT #08-7605 (aprepitant) and study TT #10-9013 (fosaperepitant) are non-GLP dose-range 
finding studies in rat and dog, respectively. The pivotal studies TT #09-7200 (aprepitant) and TT #10-

Initially the log Kow of 4.75 at pH 7 indicated potential for bioaccumulation, however based on the 
results of a bioconcentration study in fish where the BCFss was in the range of 39.2-47.9 it can be 
concluded that aprepitant has little potential to bioaccumulate. Therefore, aprepitant is not considered 
as a PBT substance. Aprepitant showed potential to adsorb to organic matter in soil, however the log 
Koc sludge value is less than the trigger value of 4 and terrestrial studies are not required. 
Aprepitant was not readily biodegraded and a DT50 for the whole system in the OECD 308 study was 
not reproted due to steadily increase of test item in the sediment compartment. However, the DT50 of 
the whole system was calculated to 388 and 1131 d (12°C). Thus, aprepitant is considered as very 
persistent even though evidence of some degradation was observed. There was significant shifting to 
the sediment compartment and a sediment risk assessment was conducted. 
Aprepitant was of low toxicity to microbials, algae, Daphnia, fish and Chironomus riparius. In addition 
to the required chronic tests acute toxicity studies were submitted for Daphnia and fish. These studies 
are of low relevance to the overall risk assessment. 
All PEC/PNEC quotients were below 1 (0.1 for micro-organisms) indicating that aprepitant, in the 
proposed use, does not pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Two juvenile toxicity studies on aprepitant in juvenile rats and two juvenile toxicity studies on 
fosaprepitant in juvenile dogs have been submitted. The studies on fosaprepitant in dogs are submitted 
because fosaprepitant is rapidly dephosphorylated in vivo to the active moiety aprepitant. 
In the pivotal study on aprepitant the rats were dosed by oral gavage at 10, 250 and 1000 mg/kg, 
b.i.d. between PND 10 and PNW 9, followed by a 2 months recovery period.  
There was a decreased body weight gain from PND 10 to 12 in all aprepitant-treated groups 
(female/male: 26%/20%, 66%/64%, and 78%/77% below control in the 10-, 250-, and 1000-mg/kg 
b.i.d. groups, respectively). However thereafter body weight gains were similar to control.  
At PND 28, the first day of observation, all female rats in the 250-mg/kg b.i.d. and 1000-mg/kg b.i.d. 
groups displayed vaginal opening compared to 20% in controls, i.e. aprepitant treatment led to an 
earlier vaginal opening. The mean day of occurrence in the 10-mg/kg b.i.d. group (PND 32.8 ± 2.7) 
was similar to the control group (PND 31.7 ± 2.8). In male rats, the mean days of appearance of 
preputial separation in the 10-, 250-, and 1000-mg/kg b.i.d. groups (PND 46.2 ± 2.9, 47.4 ± 2.9, 48.2 
± 3.1, respectively) were delayed 2, 3, and 4 days compared to controls (PND 44.2 ± 3.1). There 
were, however, no treatment-related effects on mating performance, fertility or embryonic/fetal 
survival and no pathological changes in the reproductive organs at necropsy. 
At interim necropsy in PNW 9, increased hepatic weights (males and females, from 10 mg/kg b.i.d) 
that correlated with hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased thyroid weights (males and females, 
from 250 mg/kg b.i.d.) that correlated with follicular cell hypertrophy were observed. However, at the 
final necropsy in PNW 14 no gross pathological or histomorphologic changes were found and there was 
an absence, or a notable reduction, in liver and thyroid weight increases, indicating reversibility. 
Similar toxicological findings in the liver and thyroid were found in previous studies in adult rats and 
were considered to be due to microsomal enzyme induction in the liver and a subsequent increased 
thyroxine clearance with compensatory TSH elevation, a well-known effect in rodents. 
Review of the toxicokinetic data in rats revealed that there were consistent sex differences in systemic 
exposures across all dose groups (at PNW 6 and PNW 9, but not at PNW 4). Female rats had 
approximately 1.9-4.5 fold higher systemic exposure values compared to male rats. A similar gender 
EMEND

difference in exposure level has been seen also in previous studies in adult rats where a higher 
metabolism was seen in males, possibly due to differences in P-450 enzyme expression between males 
and females. A plateau in systemic exposure (AUC0-24h and Cmax) was observed between 125 and 
1000 mg/kg b.i.d. in PNW 4 and PNW 9 (study nr TT#08-7605) and between 250 and 1000 mg/kg 
b.i.d. in PNW 6 (study nr TT#09-7200). This has been observed previously also in adult rats as a result 
of saturation of absorption of aprepitant. 
The exposure in rats at 10 mg/kg b.i.d. (NOAEL=<10 mg/kg b.i.d. in study nr TT#09-7200), AUC0-
24h level of 7.33 µg*h/ml in males and 13.8 µg*h/ml in females, gives margins to clinically relevant 
exposure of less than 1 in both males and females, based on 20.9 µg*h/ml, mean AUC in pediatric 
human subjects given 3 mg/kg aprepitant (day 1).    
In adult rats after repeated dosing the target organs were the thyroid and the liver and there were a 
number of changes in clinical pathology parameters (similar as in the juvenile animals), at exposure 
levels similar to, or lower, than the clinically relevant exposure.   
In the pivotal study on fosaprepitant in juvenile dogs there was a decreased body weight gain (PND 14 
to PND 42) by 18% for males at 6 mg/kg/day and by 32% and 15% for females at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day, 
respectively, compared to controls.  
A decreased heart to brain weight was observed in males at 6 mg/kg/day (23% below control values) 
and in females at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (30% and 24%, respectively, below control values). However, 
there were no histomorphologial changes in the heart and no electrocardiographic changes. 
A decreased testicular weight and a reduced size of Leydig cells were seen in 4 males at 6 mg/kg/day. 
The exposure in males at 4 mg/kg/day (NOAEL) of 35.8 µg*h/ml gives a margin to clinically relevant 
exposure of approximately 1.7 based on 20.9 µg*h/ml, mean AUC in pediatric human subjects 6 
months-<12 years given 3 mg/kg aprepitant (day 1). Endometrial and myometrial hypertrophy of the 
uterine horns and body associated with increased uterine weight, hypertrophy of the cervical 
muscularis, and edema of the lamina propria and submucosa of the vagina were seen in 1 female at 4 
mg/kg/day and in 4 females at 6 mg/kg/day. The exposure level at 2 mg/kg/day fosaprepitant 
(NOAEL), AUC0-24h level of approximately 15.9 µg*h/ml, gives a margin to clinically relevant 
exposure of less than 1, based on 20.9 µg*h/ml, mean AUC in pediatric human subjects 6 months-<12 
years given 3 mg/kg aprepitant (day 1).  
In previous studies in adult dogs (oral administration of aprepitant) the target organs were the 
reproductive organs (prostate, testis and ovaries). Testicular degeneration was seen from 25 mg/kg 
b.i.d. The exposure level at 5 mg/kg/day (NOAEL) gives a margin towards clinical relevant exposure of 
approximately 13. The findings in the female reproductive organs were not seen previously in adult 
animals.  
Regarding the dog juvenile findings the applicant argues that since there was no disruption of tissue 
architecture in the reproductive organs the findings are probably reversible. This can be agreed on, 
however, there is no data substantiating this, as no recovery group was included in the study. The lack 
of histomorphological changes in both rats and dogs, and the lack of effects on reproduction 
performance in rats is reassuring. Of importance in the discussion on clinical relevance is the duration 
of treatment in children versus the animal studies. Animals were exposed for a substantial longer 
duration than children (49 days for rats and 28 days for dogs, versus 3 days per chemotherapy cycle 
for children), and therefore any possible transient effect on the endocrine system is unlikely to be of 
clinical relevance and will not lead to a change in the B/R of aprepitant.  
Review of the toxicokinetic data in dogs showed that there was a rapid conversion in plasma of 
fosaprepitant to aprepitant. The mean plasma levels of fosaprepitant 5 minutes post dose were 14-46 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 21/100 
 
 
 
fold lower (all dose levels) compared to the plasma level 2 minutes post dose. There were no sex 
differences in exposure to fosaprepitant or aprepitant.  
In the pivotal study in juvenile rats, they were evaluated from PND 10 to PNW 9, consequently the 
corresponding early stage (1 month to 12 years) of development in humans is considered covered (the 
pivotal study on fosaprepitant in dogs, treatment time PND 14-PND 42 corresponds to an age of 1 
month-2 years in human). Thus, the age-group of paediatric subjects of 6 months to <12 years 
intended for the use of the applied powder for oral suspension formulation is considered to be covered 
non-clinically. The Applicant also has applied for extending the indication for the already approved 80 
mg and 125 mg hard capsules (approved in adults) to include paediatric patients from 12 to 17 years 
of age. This age group can be considered to be covered by repeat dose 5- and 27-week toxicity studies 
(submitted as part of the initial Marketing Authorization Application) in which the rats were 
approximately 40 days old at study start (corresponding to an approximate 10 year old human). In 
these studies, twice daily administration of aprepitant up to 1000 mg/kg/ b.i.d did not result in any 
histomorphological effects on any reproductive organ, mammary glands, or bone. 
The findings in the reproductive organs of rat and dogs are considered unlikely to be clinically relevant 
at short term treatment and at recommended dose regimen; these findings are appropriately reflected 
in the SmPC, section 5.3.  
The new powder for oral suspension formulation of aprepitant contains no excipients that could cause 
concern, nor are there any impurities that need toxicological qualification.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from post natal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier 
vaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from 
10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no treatment-
related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/fetal survival, and no pathological changes in the 
reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from post natal day 14 to day 42, a 
decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/d and increased 
uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were seen in 
females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of aprepitant. For 
short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are considered unlikely 
to be clinically relevant. These findings are appropriately reflected in the SmPC, section 5.3. 
Considering the above data, aprepitant is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Paediatric pharmacokinetic data for aprepitant were obtained from studies 134 and 097 (CINV), and 
from study 148 (PONV).  
Biopharmaceutics 
No biopharmaceutic studies have been performed to characterise the new powder for oral suspension 
(PFS), i.e. there is no comparative bioavailability study vs. the capsules and no food effect study. The 
bioavailability for the previously approved 80 mg and 125 mg capsules is about 60-70%. Data in the 
original application for the capsules demonstrated that the bioavailability of aprepitant is dependent on 
the particle size of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Introduction of the aprepitant colloidal 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 24/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dispersion greatly increased the bioavailability from the capsule as compared with early tablet 
formulations. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (aprepitant colloidal dispersion with controlled 
particle size) is the same. Importantly, all pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data for the paediatric 
patient population <12 years, for which the PFS is indicated, was obtained using the final PFS 
formulation. Furthermore, the capsule and the PFS are not intended to be interchangeable.  
Based on data in the original application, the food effect for aprepitant appears also to be largely 
dependent on particle size of the active substance. The bioavailability of the capsules increased 40%, 
i.e. is expected to be about 100% with a standard breakfast. This effect is not considered clinically 
relevant and the capsules can be administered with or without food. Assuming similar fasting 
bioavailability for the PFS, the food effect cannot be relevantly larger for the PFS. The PFS was 
administered without regard to concomitant food in the pivotal study. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The Applicant has proposed dosing per kg bodyweight in paediatric patients <12 years, while the adult 
flat dose is proposed for adolescent patients. Pharmacokinetic data with the proposed body-weight 
based dosing to children <12 years is relatively limited. However, based on more extensive 
pharmacokinetic data from three different paediatric studies covering the age range 0.5-17 years and 
different dosing regimens, the Applicant developed a population pharmacokinetic model. The model 
adequately describes the observed data across all age categories. There was no significant residual 
trend in IIV of CL vs age suggesting that the included maturation function on CL is sufficient to 
describe the change in CL with age over the whole age span. 
The population pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate exposure with the proposed body-weight 
based dose in children <12 years as well as the flat dose in adolescents. Pharmacokinetic data, 
observed as well as simulated, demonstrate that with these doses, mean exposure (AUC) is somewhat 
lower in paediatric patients and adolescents than what has previously been observed in adult cancer 
patients. The lowest simulated mean AUC was seen in patients aged 6-<12 years.  Mean Cmin values 
were generally lower in children < 12 years than in adults and adolescents. Simulated pharmacokinetic 
parameters are shown in Figure 1 to Figure 4.

The Applicant suggests that the observed Cmin values in paediatric patients are at the plateau of the 
previously established (in adults) concentration-response curve in terms of receptor occupancy and

that based on trough concentrations of about 100 ng/ml, at least 90% receptor occupancy can be 
expected in paediatric patients < 12 years (Figure 5). Therefore, and as efficacy was demonstrated in 
the pivotal efficacy trial, the Applicant suggests that the pharmacokinetic differences between 
paediatric and adult patients is not clinically relevant.

receptors (previous, adult data) 
Proposed dose nomogram 
In the pivotal efficacy and safety study, aprepitant was dosed strictly according to bodyweight in the 
children <12 years. However, in order to facilitate dosing in clinical practice, the Applicant has 
proposed a dose nomogram for the SmPC, where dosing is proposed over a small range of weights 
(“bins”). The relative difference between the low and high end of the weights within each range, or bin, 
is between ~20-30%. The basis for the doses is predicated upon the weight-based regimen (3.0 mg/kg 
on Day 1 followed by 2.0 mg/kg on Days 2 and 3) applied to the highest weight in the range with small 
adjustments owing to the volume and precision of the oral dispenser (5 mL) required for 
administration. Considering that the efficacy of lower aprepitant exposures in children has not been 
determined, and that aprepitant appears to have a good clinical margin of safety and tolerability, the 
application of 3 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 2 mg/kg on Days 2 and 3 was targeted to the upper end 
of each weight range in order to maintain the clinical benefit demonstrated in the clinical trials.  
In order to support the proposed dose nomogram, which has not been verified in a clinical trial, the 
Applicant performed a series of simulations of the predicted exposure, using the population 
pharmacokinetic model based on paediatric data from studies P097, P134 and P148. 
The simulations indicate that using the nomogram results in slightly higher (~30%) aprepitant 
exposures compared to the individualised weight-based regimen.

Special populations 
No data in paediatric patients with hepatic or renal impairment which is acceptable. The population 
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no clinically relevant effect of gender or race on aprepitant 
pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new interaction studies in paediatric patients were submitted 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Aprepitant (EMEND) is a selective, high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) 
receptors. 
The mechanism of emesis is believed to be similar in adults and children, that is a complex process 
between neurotransmitters and receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems initiated 
by the stimulation of dopamine, opiate, histamine, acetylcholine, neurokinin (NK1) and/or serotonin 
type-3 (5-HT3) receptors. Neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists have been identified as a novel 
class of anti-emetics. Substance P is the preferred agonist for NK1 receptors and belongs to a family of 
neuropeptides known as tachykinins. In experimental models, NK1 receptor antagonists have been 
shown to have potent and usually long-lasting, anti-emetic activity against a broad spectrum of both 
central and peripheral emetogens whereas 5-HT3 antagonists show a more limited spectrum of activity 
with efficacy mostly against peripheral emetogens. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
For children, no new pharmacodynamic data are submitted. The pharmacodynamic profile is 
sufficiently investigated in adults. The absence of news data is acceptable.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Biopharmaceutics 
The lack of biopharmaceutic studies for the new PFS is acceptable. It is agreed that based on the 
similarity of the PFS with the previously approved capsule and in particular the colloidal dispersion of 
the active substance, which is identical, bioavailability can be expected to be in the same range for the 
two formulations. Even if there would be a small difference, strict bioequivalence between the two is 
not necessary. All efficacy and safety data for paediatric patients < 12 years (for which the PFS is 
indicated) were obtained using the final market formulation of the PFS, and the PFS and the capsules 
are not intended to be used interchangeably. It is also agreed that a clinically relevant food effect for 
the PFS is unlikely.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The population pharmacokinetic model adequately describes the change in CL over the whole 
paediatric age span and is considered adequate for simulations. The pharmacokinetic data, observed 
as well as simulated, indicate that mean exposure (AUC0-24) is lower in paediatric patients (0.5-17 
years) than that previously observed in adults. Trough (Cmin) values were lower in paediatric patients 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 29/100 
 
 
 
 
<12 years than in adults, while adolescents had trough values in the same range as adults at the 
125/80/80 mg dose regimen.  
Based on a previously established PKPD relationship, the Applicant suggests that the trough 
concentrations seen in paediatric patients at the proposed doses are sufficient to obtain at least 90% 
receptor occupancy and therefore sufficient anti-emetic efficacy may still be expected. However, the 
Applicant has in a previous application presented an analysis (Figure 6), where the upper part of the 
established PKPD curve on receptor occupancy vs. concentration (depicted in Figure 5 above) is super-
imposed with the observed trough concentration ranges in adults at different dosing regimens (shaded 
bars in Figure 6 below). It is noted that trough concentrations of around 100 ng/ml, obtained at the 
proposed doses for children < 12 years, are between a regimen that produced sub-maximal efficiency 
in CINV in adults in early studies (40 mg/25 mg) and regimens shown to be maximally effective in 
CINV in adults (125/80/80 mg and 375/250 mg).  
Figure 6. Striatal NK1-Receptor Occupancy and Ranges of Mean Aprepitant Trough Plasma 
Concentrations Achieved With Different Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Dosing 
Regimens for Aprepitant 
Thus, pharmacokinetic data cannot be considered fully supportive of the chosen dose regimens for 
paediatric patients. In response to questions, the Applicant simulated exposure and Cmin (C48 and 
C72) values at higher dose regimens in children <12 years. A regimen of 4/3/3 mg/kg on Day 1, 2 and 
3, respectively, would give concentrations that are significantly higher than what has previously been 
established as safe in adults and is not relevant to consider. A regimen of 3/3/3 mg/kg on each of Day 
1, 2 and 3 could possibly give C48 and C72 levels more in the range of what has been observed in 
adults at efficacious doses than the currently proposed doses of 2 mg/kg on Days 2 and 3. However, 
there were also other differences than pharmacokinetics between the study populations in the 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 30/100 
 
 
 
 
paediatric and adult studies that may have affected treatment outcome. Available data are therefore 
not sufficient to determine whether the pharmacokinetic differences are of clinical importance. As the 
currently proposed dose regimen led to clinically relevant response rates in all age groups, it is 
considered acceptable (see discussion of clinical efficacy below).  
Proposed dose nomogram 
The dose nomogram proposed for the SmPC has not been confirmed in a clinical trial. Simulations 
indicate that using the nomogram results in slightly higher (~30%) aprepitant exposures compared to 
the individualised weight-based regimen. This was not unexpected, as the dose per weight group was 
set to aim for target exposure at the highest weight in each group. The approach is acceptable, given 
the somewhat lower exposure seen in paediatric patients as compared with adults with the strict 
bodyweight-based dosing, and the favourable safety profile of aprepitant. The increase in exposure 
when using the nomogram is not larger than other exposure changes that have been considered not 
clinically relevant, e.g. the food effect of 40%. The proposed nomogram is therefore acceptable. 
Interactions 
As aprepitant is a substrate for as well as an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inducer via PXR (e.g. CYP2C9 
and 3A4), its pharmacokinetic profile (characterised in adults by auto-inhibition and auto-induction) 
and interaction potential may be somewhat different in the smallest children, in which enzyme 
maturation is ongoing. Overall, however, the interaction potential is expected to be largely similar in 
children, adolescents and adults. Interaction studies cannot be required in small children. A statement 
that interaction data in children is not available has been added to section 4.5 of the SmPC, which is 
adequate.  
It was previously shown that addition of dexamethasone, a mild to moderate inducer, to aprepitant 
treatment did not relevantly affect aprepitant exposure in adults. On the other hand, aprepitant 
increased the exposure to dexamethasone, and the dexamethasone dose should be reduced if co-
administered with aprepitant as reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Aprepitant is a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. The pharmacodynamics has been thoroughly 
assessed in previous Market authorisation applications for adult indications. Aprepitant is 
recommended to be given in combination with 5HT3 inhibitors for optimal antiemetic effect. The 
pharmacodynamics of aprepitant is believed to be the same in children and adults and the aim of the 
paediatric dose finding was therefore to obtain similar exposure in children as in adults.  
Over the whole age range, paediatric patients (0.5 – 17 years) receiving the proposed doses of 
3/2/2 mg/kg in children <12 years and 125/80/80 mg in adolescents are predicted to have lower 
exposure on Day 1 (AUC0-24) than what has previously been observed in adults. Cmin (C48 and C72) 
values are predicted to be lower in the children < 12 years than in adults. However, as the studied 
dose regimen led to clinically relevant response rates in all paediatric age groups (see Clinical Efficacy), 
the observed pharmacokinetic differences do not give raise to objections against the proposed dose 
regimen.   
The biopharmaceutic characterisation of the new paediatric powder for oral suspension is considered 
sufficient.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The general approach to dose selection for the paediatric trials taken by the applicant was to match 
drug exposures to those previously demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in adults. In adults, 
plasma exposures associated with the approved adult dosing regimen of 125 mg aprepitant on Day 1 
followed by 80 mg aprepitant on Days 2 to 3 (125/80/80 mg regimen) result in CNS NK1 receptor 
occupancy >95%. Doses higher than the 125/80/80 mg regimen were not associated with greater 
efficacy in a clinical study, whereas doses associated with CNS NK1 receptor occupancy <80 to 85% 
were submaximally efficacious. The Applicant therefore considered it reasonable and prudent to assess 
whether a positive benefit-risk relationship in children could be demonstrated at exposures similar to 
those shown to be well tolerated and maximally efficacious in adults. 
The initial aprepitant paediatric study conducted was Protocol 097 (P097), which was a double-blind, 
Phase III pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and exploratory efficacy study for the prevention of CINV in 
adolescent subjects 12 to 17 years of age. This study utilized the approved adult dosing regimen of 
125 mg aprepitant on Day 1 followed by 80 mg aprepitant on Days 2 to 3, administered concomitantly 
with ondansetron and dexamethasone. The results of this study suggested that PK parameters in 
adolescents were similar to those in adults and that aprepitant was generally well-tolerated, and 
therefore further evaluation of the adult regimen in adolescents was reasonable. 
The second study conducted, Protocol 134 (P134), was an open-label, Phase I study that evaluated the 
PK, safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy in subjects 6 months to 17 years of age. This study 
consisted of five parts, described below (Supportive studies), evaluating oral aprepitant in either a 
poweder for solution (PFS) or capsule formulation and fosaprepitant dimeglumine, an intravenous (IV) 
prodrug of aprepitant.  
Pharmacokinetic data from Protocols 097 and 134, as well as PK data from a separate paediatric PONV 
trial that studied a single lower dose of aprepitant, Protocol 148 (P148), were used to develop a 
population PK model. This model was used to conduct simulations on paediatric dose adjustments for 
subjects 6 months to <12 years of age that would approximate PK parameters associated with safe 
and efficacious exposures in adults. This efficacy and safety of this dose regimen was further evaluated 
within Protocol 134 (Part IV) as well as Protocol 208 as noted below.  
The results of the population PK model supported the doses chosen for the confirmatory phase 3 study 
P208.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Table 4. Objectives and endpoints P208 
Primary objective and hypothesis 
Endpoint 
Efficacy: To compare the three-day oral aprepitant 
regimen (aprepitant plus ondansetron), to 
ondansetron alone with respect to the efficacy 
endpoint of Complete Response in the 25 to 120 
hours following the initiation of emetogenic 
chemotherapy in Cycle 1 (delayed phase). 
Hypothesis: superiority 
Secondary objectives 
Efficacy: To compare the three-day oral aprepitant 
regimen, to the control regimen with respect to the 
efficacy endpoint of Complete Response in the 0 to 
24 hours following the initiation of emetogenic 
chemotherapy in Cycle 1 (acute phase). 
Efficacy: To compare the three-day oral aprepitant 
regimen, to the control regimen with respect to the 
efficacy endpoint of Complete Response in the 0-120 
hours following the initiation of emetogenic 
chemotherapy in Cycle 1 (overall phase). 
Efficacy: To compare the three-day oral aprepitant 
regimen, to the control regimen with respect to the 
efficacy endpoint of No Vomiting, regardless of 
rescue medication use, in the 120 hours following the 
initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1 
(overall phase). 
Complete Response: The proportion of patients 
with no vomiting, no retching, and no use of 
rescue medication. 
Endpoint 
Complete Response: The proportion of patients 
with no vomiting, no retching, and no use of 
rescue medication. 
Complete Response: The proportion of patients 
with no vomiting, no retching, and no use of 
rescue medication. 
No Vomiting: The proportion of patients with no 
vomiting, irrespective of use of rescue 
medication. 
Safety: To assess the safety and tolerability of the 
three-day oral aprepitant regimen in patients from 6 
months to 17 years of age who are receiving 
emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1. 
Clinical and laboratory adverse events that are 
considered drug-related, serious, serious drug-
related, or lead to discontinuation of study 
therapy.  
There are no pre-specified events of clinical 
interest (ECI) for this study, other than the 
Merck-standard ECIs of overdose and Drug-
Induced Liver Injury events. 
Exploratory objectives and endpoints 
Efficacy: The number of emetic episodes in the 120 hours following initiation of emetogenic 
chemotherapy (overall phase); 
Efficacy: The time to first rescue medication in the 120 hours following initiation of emetogenic 
chemotherapy (overall phase); 
Efficacy: The time to first vomiting in the 120 hours following initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy 
(overall phase); 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 37/100 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy: The number of patients with no use of rescue medication in the 120 hours following initiation of 
emetogenic chemotherapy (overall phase). 
Safety: To describe the adverse event profile of the aprepitant regimen when administered to paediatric 
cancer patients receiving additional cycles of emetogenic chemotherapy. 
Vomiting Assessment: A vomiting episode was defined as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion 
of stomach contents through the mouth) or retches (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of 
stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes are, by definition, separated by the absence of emesis 
and retching for at least one minute. The timing (date and time) of each vomiting episode was 
recorded by the patient/parent/guardian in the diary at the time of the occurrence. 
Sample size 
This study was planned to randomize approximately 150 patients into the aprepitant regimen group 
and 150 patients into the control regimen group and has 80% power to demonstrate the superiority of 
the aprepitant regimen over the control regimen at an overall one-sided, 2.5% alpha-level, if the 
underlying treatment difference in Complete Response is 15 percentage points. The power and sample 
size are based on the following assumptions: 1) an approximately 3% (overall) dropout rate, and 2) an 
underlying response rate of 60% for the control regimen. The minimum criterion for success is that the 
one-sided p-value < 0.025. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized centrally and assigned to 
one of the two treatment regimens via the IVRS. At the time of randomization via IVRS, subjects were 
stratified by age on Day 1 of Cycle 1 into the appropriate age cohort (6 months to < 2 years; 2 to < 6 
years; 6 to <12 years; or 12 to 17 years). 
Patients were further stratified based on planned use of a chemotherapy agent associated with a Very 
High Risk of emetogenicity in Cycle 1 (Yes or No) and planned use of dexamethasone as an antiemetic 
in Cycle 1 (Yes or No). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study, conducted under in-house blinding conditions. The study medication for 
Cycle 1 was supplied in a blinded manner based on a Component Identification Number (CID). At the 
time of subject randomization, the IVRS assigned a CID number for the randomized subjects. Site staff 
retrieved the corresponding clinical supply (identified via the CID) for administration to the subject. 
Unblinded personnel were not required to prepare the study medication as the study medication for 
Cycle 1 (aprepitant and placebo) was supplied in a blinded manner. 
Clinical supplies for Cycles 2-6 were open-label. 
Dexamethasone, when administered, was sourced locally and prepared by the unblinded pharmacist in 
order to maintain the blind. A dose reduction of dexamethasone was required for patients in the 
aprepitant regimen; as such, unblinded personnel was required to prepare the dexamethasone 
according to the patient’s treatment group assignment. The unblinded pharmacist or designee 
prepared the intravenous dexamethasone in a manner that allowed site staff to remain blinded when 
administering the corticosteroid. 
Zofran™/ondansetron was sourced locally and was open-label for all study cycles.

Statistical methods 
Nominal p-values were computed for other efficacy analyses as a measure of strength of association 
between the endpoint and the treatment effect rather than formal tests of hypotheses. Unless 
otherwise stated, all statistical tests were conducted at the α=0.05 (2- sided) level. 
The treatment comparisons for Complete Response and No Vomiting was made using the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) test stratified by age (<2 years, 2 to 17 years), use of dexamethasone as an 
antiemetic in Cycle 1 (yes, no), and receipt of very high risk emetogenic chemotherapy agent in Cycle 
1 (yes, no). The superiority hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing the 1-tailed p-value to 0.025 
and significance declared if the p-value was≤0.025. 
A supportive analysis was performed using a logistic regression model that included terms for 
treatment (aprepitant regimen, control regimen), use of dexamethasone as an antiemetic in Cycle 1 
(yes, no), receipt of a very high risk emetogenic chemotherapy agent in Cycle 1 (yes, no), and age 
(<2 years, 2 to 17 years). The final model did not include treatment interaction terms. 
Any vomiting, retching, dry heaves, or use of rescue therapy within a phase (acute or delayed) would 
define a patient as having an unfavorable response for that phase and for the overall analysis 
(regardless of missing data at other time points) for all 3 efficacy patient populations (ITT, FAS, and 
PP). In the ITT and FAS, response to therapy in a particular phase was to be assessed based on the 
observed data in that phase. Patients with missing binary data for the primary and secondary 
endpoints were to be classified as non-responder/failure in both the ITT and FAS efficacy analyses. In 
the PP population, any missing data (in the absence of vomiting or use of rescue therapy at another 
time point) would exclude the patient from the analysis for that phase and for the overall analysis. 
For the exploratory analysis of time to first use of rescue medication, Kaplan-Meier curves depicting 
the percentage of patients who did not use rescue medication, since the initiation of emetogenic 
chemotherapy, were presented. Kaplan-Meier curves depicting the percentage of patients who are 
vomiting-free, ignoring rescue, since the initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy were also be 
presented

Recruitment 
Trial Initiation Date 22-Sep-2011, Trial Completion Date 16-Aug-2013. 
Conduct of the study 
Study P208 underwent three protocol amendments. The first and third were minor. 
The second amendment (11 July 2012) included changes made in response to regulatory agency 
feedback obtained after the trial began. These included interchange of primary and secondary 
objectives (following advice from FDA), change of primary analysis population to the Intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, change of primary analysis method to Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) test, and 
change minimum age for inclusion from 0 to 6 months.  
The changes to the protocol did not affect the study results or interpretation thereof. A rationale for 
excluding patients below the age of 6 months were given in the context of the Paediatric Investigation 
Plan (PIP): “A waiver was granted for the development of the product from birth to less than 6 months 
based on the grounds of safety concerns since it will be difficult standardizing the dose in subjects less 
than 6 months of age due to unpredictable cytochrome P450 enzyme levels compared to patients > 6 
months.” 
Baseline data 
Somewhat more male than female patients were enrolled, 54 vs. 46%. With regard to age group, the 
youngest age group represented nearly 12% of study participants while the other three age groups 
represented approximately 30% each. A majority of patients were white (76%). 
With regard to stratification factors (concerning planned use), a majority of patients actually received 
chemotherapy with very high risk of emetogenicity (66.2%), while a majority of patients did not 
receive dexamethasone as part of the antiemetic regimen in Cycle 1 (71.5%).

Table 5. Baseline characteristics, P208 
Tumour type 
The most common primary malignancies were Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma (~11%), followed 
by rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma, representing approximately 8% of the population and 
medullablastoma and acute lymphocytic leukaemia, which represented 7% of the population. In 
general, the treatment groups were balanced with regard to primary malignancies. 
Overall, the baseline demographic and disease characteristics, as well as use of dexamethasone and 
very high emetogenic chemotherapy (VHEC) were balanced across study arms.

Table 6. Disposition of subjects, Cycle 1, Study P208 
Following Cycle 1, 171 subjects elected to participate in the optional cycles (Cycles 2-6). Of those, 
all but one subject received study medication in Cycle 2. This patient was excluded from further 
efficacy and safety analyses.  
Table 7. Disposition of subjects, Cycle 2-6, Study P208 
Thus, 27% of the patients included in Cycle 1 also completed all Cycles 2-6. For 30 % of patients this 
was explained by the fact that they completed the chemotherapy regimen before a total of 6 cycles 
had been administered. Another large proportion (15%) did not fulfil the additional inclusion criteria for 
cycle 2-6. Only 1% discontinued due to adverse event.

 Overall Phase: 0 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy. 
In the delayed phase, significantly (p<0.0001) more patients on the aprepitant regimen had Complete 
Response compared to those on the control regimen. The aprepitant regimen was also more effective 
than the control regimen in the acute phase (nominal p=0.0135) and the overall phase (nominal 
p=0.0002). 
The result in the primary endpoint, the delayed phase, was statistically significant well above the 
threshold for superiority. Similarly, the results in the acute and overall phases both had nominal p-
values < 0.02. The difference between arms in the proportion of patients with complete response is 
considered clinically relevant with the responding portion approximately doubled in the overall phase 
(absolute difference 20%), as well as in the delayed phase (absolute difference 25%), and increased 
by more than ¼ in the acute phase (absolute difference 14%). 
The corresponding table for the primary endpoint in the FAS population (ITT minus one patient) 
showed nearly identical figures, percentages and annotations, except for one less patient included in 
the control arm (m= 149 instead of 150), thus supporting the primary analysis (not shown).  
In addition, analysis of Complete response in the ITT population was performed using the originally 
planned logistic regression model resulted in the same frequencies and achievement of clinical 
significance (not shown).  
The results in the PP population were very similar to the primary analysis in the ITT, thereby 
supporting the results (see table below).

 Overall Phase: 0 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy. 
In the overall phase, more subjects on the aprepitant regimen reported No Vomiting compared to 
those on the control regimen (nominal p=<0.0001). The aprepitant regimen was also more effective 
than the control regimen in the acute phase (nominal p=0.0023) and the delayed phase (nominal 
p=<0.0001). 
With regard to No vomiting, the difference between arms in the proportions responding is very similar 
(slightly larger) in all three phases compared with the primary endpoint (Complete response), 
supporting the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoint – Number of Emetic Episodes 
Details for acute and delayed phase, respectively, are shown in the tables below.

Table 13. Number (%) of Patients With Vomiting During the Delayed Phase by Frequency and

In both phases (acute and delayed), the largest difference between arms were seen in the categories 
with 2 episodes of vomiting and particularly in the group with >3 emetic episodes. 
Secondary endpoint – Time to First Vomiting 
Figure 7. Kaplan-Meier Curves for Time to First Vomiting Episode From Start of Chemotherapy 
Administration in the Overall Phase-Cycle 1 (Intent to Treat population) P208 
The estimated median time to first vomiting was 94.5 hours in the aprepitant regimen group compared 
with 26.0 hours in the control regimen group (nominal p<0.0001, based on log-rank test). 
The difference in vomiting-free time appears clearly clinically relevant. In the first 8 hours there 
appears to be no added benefit from aprepitant for this outcome measure, in line with the lower 
difference in responders in the acute phase observed for other endpoints.

Male patients in the aprepitant arm responded in a higher frequency than female patients in all study 
phases, which was not the case in the control arm. 
Use of corticosteroid and VHEC 
The add-on efficacy of aprepitant was consistent in patients receiving and not receiving 
dexamethasone as anti-emetic in Cycle1, with around 20% additional responding patients in both 
groups in the overall phase. The add-on efficacy of aprepitant was also largely consistent in patients 
receiving and not receiving Very High Risk Emetogenic Chemotherapy (VHEC) in Cycle1, with 16-21% 
additional patients achieving Complete response in the overall phase.  
Within each age group, the number of subjects who received ondansetron and dexamethasone was 
comparable between the 2 treatment groups. In addition, the mean daily doses for ondansetron and 
dexamethasone were either similar between treatment groups or higher in the control regimen group. 
The one exception is in the 12 to 17 age group where the mean daily ondansetron dose was higher in 
the aprepitant regimen group than in the control regimen group (14.6 vs. 11.9 mg), but the difference 
in effect between treatment arms in this age group was large and not likely explained by the difference 
in ondansetron use. As expected, the mean daily doses increased with increasing age. Differences in 
ondansetron or dexamethasone dosing are considered unlikely to have biased the interpretation of the 
clinical trial results in favour of aprepitant. 
Duration of chemotherapy 
The add-on efficacy was clearly higher in patients receiving a 1-day chemotherapy regimen 
(approximately 40-50% difference in Complete response in the three study phases) compared with 
chemotherapy regimens over more than one day (11-19% difference between arms in the three study 
phases). 
Age 
Different patterns of efficacy and add-on benefit of aprepitant were observed for all age groups with 
regard to proportions achieving Complete response in the three study phases: 
The benefit of aprepitant was clearly clinically relevant in all three study phases in the 12-17 year age 
group, receiving the adult aprepitant regimen. The difference between arms in terms of complete 
response was thus 18%, 41% (an increase x 5 from 10 to 51%) and 30% for the acute, delayed and 
overall phases, respectively. 
In the 6-11 year old group, the efficacy in the overall phase appears low, with only 8% difference 
between arms. However, in the acute and delayed phases the difference was larger, 14% and 17%, 
respectively. This pattern indicates that the patients failing in the acute phase were others than those 
failing in the delayed phase.  
In the 2-5 year age group, the efficacy in the acute phase was high for both regimens (80.0% and 
76.7%, respectively), resulting in a very small difference of 3% between regimens. For the delayed 
phase an 18% difference favouring aprepitant was seen, however, which was further propelled to the 
overall phase.  
For the youngest group, 6 months – 1 year olds, the add-on benefit of aprepitant was consistently 
22% in all three study phases, indicating that largely the same patients failed in the acute and delayed 
phase. 
Overall, the demonstrated add-on efficacy in terms of Complete response is considered clinically 
relevant, with differences compared with the control arm at around 20% or above in the delayed and 
overall phases, while often smaller in the acute phase. In the age group 6-11 years (n=84), the add-
on benefit of aprepitant appeared somewhat lower, however, coinciding with a lower mean AUC

predicted in this age group, compared with the other age groups by the population PK model based on 
studies P134, P097 and P148. However, other differences between adults and children than PK, such 
as chemotherapy regimens, may also have affected outcomes, and the effect observed at present dose 
is considered clinically relevant in all age groups.

Summary of Efficacy for trial MK-0869-208 
Title:   
A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial, Conducted Under 
In-House Blinding Conditions, to Examine the Efficacy and Safety of Aprepitant for the Prevention of 
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in Pediatric Patients 
Study identifier 
Protocol 208 
EudraCT number:  2011-00651-16 
Design 
Hypothesis 
A worldwide, multi-center, phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-
group study with in-house blinding to assess the efficacy and safety or oral 
aprepitant for the prevention of CINV in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 
17 years, receiving emetogenic chemotherapy for a documented 
malignancy. 
Eligible patients were male or female, 6 months to 17 years of age, with 
documented malignancy at either original diagnosis or relapse, and 
scheduled to receive chemotherapeutic agent(s) associated with moderate, 
high risk, or very high risk of emetogenicity. 
Duration of main phase: 
19 - 29 Days 
Duration of Run-in phase:  Maximum of -28 days 
Maximum of 6 months 
Duration of Extension 
phase: 
Primary Efficacy Hypothesis: The three-day oral aprepitant regimen will 
provide superior control of CINV compared to the control regimen as 
measured by the proportion of patients with Complete Response in the 25 
to 120 hours following the initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy in Cycle 1.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Since this application consists of one single pivotal trial (Protocol 208) and exploratory, supportive data 
from two smaller studies (Protocols 097 and 134), no formal pooled efficacy analyses were performed 
across these studies as differences in the study designs and conduct did not support such an approach.

Assessment report  
Page 56/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, the results of the exploratory efficacy analyses from the supportive studies were 
generally consistent with those of the pivotal study.  
For example, the observed Complete Response proportions (%) in the overall phase (0 to 120 hour 
following chemotherapy) for subjects treated with aprepitant were 40.1, 28.6, and 45.0 in Protocols 
208, 097, and 134, respectively. Comparing the active-controlled studies only (Protocols 208 and 097), 
the between-group difference in proportions (i.e., the difference in percentages of subjects achieving 
Complete Response in the overall phase, between the aprepitant and control arms) were 20.1 and 23.0 
percentage points, respectively. The corresponding values for Complete Response in the acute phase 
(14.4 and 21.8, respectively) and delayed phase (24. 7 and 30.1, respectively) demonstrate a similar 
pattern. Although the smaller study size of Protocol 097 limits the ability to interpret subgroups, 
Complete Response rates were consistently higher in patients treated with aprepitant, which supports 
the findings observed in Protocol 208. These comparisons suggest that after accounting for differences 
in study populations, study designs and sample size, the efficacy of aprepitant was generally 
consistent. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
This variation intends the addition of a new pharmaceutical form (125 mg powder for oral suspension) 
for use in paediatric subpopulations with an age of 6 months to 11 years. No new data are submitted 
for other age groups than the paediatric population. This is accepted.

Protocol 134 (P134) 
“A Multi-center, Open-label, 5-Part Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of 
Aprepitant and Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine in Pediatric Patients Receiving Emetogenic Chemotherapy” 
• 
In this study both oral (aprepitant), IV (fosaprepitant), and combined IV + oral regimens were 
studied. All patients in all study parts received concomitant ondansetron IV +/- 
dexamethasone IV. 
Protocol 134 enrolled a total of 91 paediatric subjects across the 5 Parts of the study who were 6 
months to 17 years old (enrolment of subjects from birth to <6 months old was unsuccessful, despite 
over 2 year enrolment period), had a documented malignancy, and were undergoing emetogenic 
chemotherapy (HEC or MEC). Unique subjects were enrolled in Part I (Steps A and B) and Part II 
(Steps A and B). Those subjects enrolled in Part III could continue into the subsequent Parts (Part IV 
and Part V); subjects could also enrol in Part IV and/or Part V without participating in a previous Part. 
Of the 19 subjects who enrolled in Part III, 15 subjects continued into Part IV and 12 of those subjects 
continued into Part V.

Baseline data 
With regard to type of malignancy, the variation of diagnoses across study steps and parts was quite 
wide, reflecting the rareness of the conditions and the small number of patients included in each part. 
In part I (ages 12-17) bone sarcomas dominated, while in the younger age groups of parts II-V (6 
months -12 years) different -blastomas and other visceral neoplasms were predominant.  
The heterogeneity with regard to malignancies and main emetogenic chemotherapy is summarised 
below.

The small numbers and nonrandomised nature of the study precludes any firm conclusions with regard

“control” is limited due to the different HEC/MEC chemotherapy, among other heterogeneities across 
study parts.

Complete Response = No vomiting and no use of rescue therapy. 
Source: CSR, Table 11-25, Table 11-26, and Table 11-27. 
The proportions of patients in Part IV (6 months – 11 years; Aprepitant 3 mg/kg PO Day 1 + 
Aprepitant 2 mg/kg PO Day 2 + 3) achieving Complete response are noted: 80% in the acute phase, 
60% in the delayed phase and 45% in the overall phase. This is very similar to the two age groups 6 
months -1 year and 2 -5 years in the pivotal study P208, but higher than the 6-11years group. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed; however, no generalizations can be made due to the small 
number of subjects in each subgroup. 
Protocol 097 (P097) 
“A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel- Group Study, Conducted Under In-House 
Blinding Conditions, to Examine the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Aprepitant for the Prevention of 
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Associated With Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Adolescent 
Patients.” 
• 
In this study the adult aprepitant regimen was tested in adolescents.  
Design: Multicentre, randomized, double-blind parallel-group, placebo controlled trial with in-house 
blinding to assess the safety, tolerability, plasma concentration and efficacy of aprepitant in the 
prevention of CINV in adolescent patients with confirmed malignancies and who were treated with an 
emetogenic chemotherapy regimen. The protocol had 2 parts. Part One of the protocol had 2 
components with 2 dosing regimens: standard therapy regimen and aprepitant triple therapy regimen. 
The first component, which was blinded, focused on the first cycle (Cycle 1) of chemotherapy. The 
second component consisted of an optional open-label multiple-cycle extension for up to 9 subsequent 
cycles of chemotherapy (maximum of 10 cycles total). All patients received aprepitant during the 
multiple-cycle extension. Part 2 of the protocol had 2 components with 1 dosing regimen: aprepitant 
triple therapy in both Cycle 1 and in the multiple-cycle extension. As in Part One of the protocol, the 
first component focused on the first cycle (Cycle 1) of chemotherapy and the second component 
focused on the multiple-cycle extension for up to 9 subsequent cycles of chemotherapy (for a 
maximum of 10 cycles total). 
Objectives: Safety was the primary objective of this study. Efficacy and PK were secondary 
objectives. 
EMEND 
Assessment report

The study had 2 treatment groups: 
Aprepitant triple therapy regimen = Aprepitant 125 mg P.O. on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on 
Days 2 and 3 plus ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg x 3 doses) IV on Day 1 and 2 and dexamethasone 8 mg 
P.O. on Day 1 and 4 mg P.O. once daily on Days 2 to 4. 
Standard therapy regimen = Ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg x 3 doses) IV on Day 1 and 2 plus 
dexamethasone 16 mg P.O. on Day 1 and 8 mg P.O. once daily on Days 2 to 4. 
Numbers analysed: 50 patients were randomised, 32 to the aprepitant arm, 18 to standard therapy.  
Baseline factors 
The distribution of known risk factors for CINV (female gender; history of alcohol use, morning 
sickness, motion sickness, and prior chemotherapy-induced vomiting) and the number of patients with 
and without prior chemotherapy was similar between treatment groups. 
Median age was 15 years. 72% were male, 28% female.  
Bone sarcoma was the most common primary cancer diagnosis. Of all patients entered in the study, 32 
(64%) had bone sarcoma. Bone sarcoma occurred more frequently in the standard therapy group than 
in the aprepitant triple therapy group (83.3% and 53.1%, respectively). 
Complete response 
Table 21. Number (%) of Patients With Complete Response by Treatment and Phase (Modified-
Intention-to-Treat Population) - Cycle 1 Part 1, P097 
The response rates in P097are roughly around similar levels as those in the pivotal study P208. (P208 
Complete response frequencies for aprepitant (ITT): Overall 40%, Delayed 51%, Acute 66%). 
Studies P134 and P097 are considered supportive of the results of the pivotal study P208.  
Protocol 148 (P148) 
In Protocol 148 Part II, 5-8 patients in each age group (6 months-<2 years; 2-6 years; 6-<12 years; 
12-17 years) were randomized to receive a single oral dose of aprepitant (total N=27) or intravenous 
ondansetron (total N=25) prior to surgery. Ondansetron was administered as a single dose of 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 60/100 
 
 
 
 
 
0.1mg/kg IV for patients weighing <40kg, and as a single fixed dose of 4mg IV for patients weighing 
≥40kg. The dose of aprepitant administered in Part II was based upon the PK assessment for each age 
group in Part I: 15 mg + 1.1 mg/kg of aprepitant for patients 6 months to <12 years. Patients 12-17 
years of age received 40 mg of aprepitant. 
The efficacy assessment in Protocol 148 was exploratory. No Vomiting (No Vomiting, retching or dry 
heaves) and Complete Response (No Vomiting and no use of rescue medication) over the first 24 hours 
following surgery were the endpoints of primary interest. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population served 
as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in this study. The FAS population was as a 
subset of all enrolled patients with subjects excluded for the following reasons: (1) failure to receive a 
full dose of active study therapy; (2) failure to have the surgery; and (3) lack of at least one post -
treatment efficacy assessment.

P148 is not considered supportive with regard to efficacy for the present extension application (powder 
for solution) or the new sought paediatric indications, since used in a different indication (PONV). The 
data were not sufficient to determine a final dosing recommendation in this indication and no benefit 
compared with ondansetron was shown. Nevertheless the CHMP considers study P148 adequate to 
support the suggested SmPC updates (inclusion of the study results into sections 5.1 and 5.2) for the 
EMEND 40 mg capsules (PONV indication), where no new indication or new posology is proposed.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Protocol 208 (P208) randomized 307 paediatric subjects (302 were treated) with a documented 
malignancy undergoing moderate – very high emetogenic chemotherapy. Subjects were randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive either aprepitant in combination with ondansetron (aprepitant regimen) or 
ondansetron alone (control regimen). Intravenous (IV) dexamethasone was only administered as part 
of the antiemetic regimen at the discretion of the investigator. Randomization was stratified into one of 
four age cohorts (12 years to 17 years, 6 years to <12 years, 2 years to <6 years, and 6 months to 
<2 years) based on the subject’s age on Day 1 of chemotherapy in Cycle 1. There was an 
approximately even distribution of subjects in the 2 <6 year, 6 to <12 year, and 12 to 17 year cohorts 
(29.1%, 27.8%, and 31.5%, respectively), with similar distribution of age in each age cohorts between 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 61/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the two treatment regimens. Due to enrolment challenges, the youngest cohort (6 months to <2 years 
of age) enrolled 11.6% of subjects. Subjects were further stratified in Cycle 1 based on the planned 
use of a chemotherapy agent associated with a Very High Risk of Emetogenicity (VHEC) and planned 
use of dexamethasone as part of the antiemetic regimen in Cycle 1. More than half of subjects 
received a VHEC agent (66.2%), while only 28.5% of subjects received prophylactic dexamethasone. 
Use of a VHEC agent and use of prophylactic dexamethasone was approximately evenly distributed 
between the treatment regimens. 
P208 was a 1:1-randomised double-blind trial. The predefined definition of superiority was purely 
statistical requiring that a one-sided p-value < 0.025 was met.  
Changes were made to the study protocol during the study with regard to primary and secondary 
objectives (delayed vs. overall study phase), and methods for analyses. In view of the results, these 
changes did not affect the overall results or interpretation thereof, however. The minimum age for 
inclusion was also changed from 0 to 6 months, in line with a waiver in the Paediatric Investigation 
Plan. 
Concerning the optional Cycles 2-6 it is noted that only 27% of the patients included in Cycle 1 also 
completed all Cycles 2-6. For 30 % of patients this was explained by the fact that they completed the 
chemotherapy regimen before a total of 6 cycles had been administered. Furthermore, a large 
proportion (15%) did not fulfil the additional inclusion criteria for cycle 2-6. Only 1% discontinued due 
to adverse event. Still, there remains approximately 22% who did not complete due to patient (11%) 
or physician decision (11%). This could lower somehow the degree of evidence gained from this part of 
the study, (safety objectives only) but was not considered by the CHMP to a have a significant impact 
on the validity of the data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was Complete response, defined as the proportion of patients with no vomiting, 
no retching, and no use of rescue medication, in the 25 to 120 hours following the initiation of 
emetogenic chemotherapy (delayed phase) in Cycle 1. In the ITT population, complete response in the 
delayed phase was achieved in 50.7% vs. 26.0% (p<0.0001) of patients in the aprepitant and control 
regimens, respectively. I.e. the proportion with Complete response was approximately doubled (with 
an absolute difference of 25%). The proportion with Complete response was also doubled (from 20 to 
40%, nominal p=0.0002) in the overall phase (0-120 hours after chemotherapy start), and increased 
by one fourth (from 52 to 66%, nominal p=0.0135) in the acute phase (0-24 hours after start). 
The Complete response results for the three study phases in the ITT population by the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) test method (primary endpoint, primary analysis population, and primary 
analysis method) were supported by very similar results in the FAS and PP populations, as well as by 
the results using a logistic regression model initially planned. As such, the results of the primary 
endpoint are considered robust. 
The results from the secondary endpoint No vomiting further supported the primary endpoint with very 
similar (slightly larger) and highly statistically significant differences (by nominal p-values) between 
arms in the proportions of patients responding (i.e. having no vomiting) in all three phases.  
The secondary endpoint Number of emetic episodes showed that in both the acute and delayed phase, 
the largest difference between arms was seen in the category with more than 3 emetic episodes, while 
smaller differences or similar proportions were seen for the categories with1, 2 or 3 emetic episodes. 
Thus, there is a relevant magnitude of effect in the group with the worst problems. 
The estimated median time to first vomiting was 94.5 hours in the aprepitant regimen group compared 
with 26.0 hours in the control regimen group (nominal p<0.0001, based on log-rank test). This 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 62/100 
 
 
 
difference in vomiting-free time appears clearly clinically relevant. In the first 8 hours there appears to 
be no added benefit from aprepitant for this outcome measure, in line with the lower difference in 
responders in the acute phase observed for other endpoints. 
With regard to the endpoint No use of rescue medicine, the difference in proportions between arms is 
similar, although somewhat smaller, in all phases compared with the primary endpoint, reflecting that 
use of rescue medicine is a less frequent event and being one of the components of the composite 
primary endpoint Complete response. 
Subgroup analyses 
Male patients in the aprepitant arm responded in a higher frequency than female patients in all study 
phases, which was not the case in the control arm. 
The add-on efficacy of aprepitant was consistent in patients receiving and not receiving 
dexamethasone as anti-emetic in Cycle1, with around 20% additional responding patients in both 
groups in the overall phase. The add-on efficacy of aprepitant was also largely consistent in patients 
receiving and not receiving Very High Risk Emetogenic Chemotherapy (VHEC) in Cycle1, with 16-21% 
additional patients achieving Complete response in the overall phase.  
The add-on efficacy was clearly higher in patients receiving a 1-day chemotherapy regimen 
(approximately 40-50% difference in Complete response in the three study phases) compared with 
chemotherapy regimens over more than one day (11-19% difference between arms in the three study 
phases). 
Different patterns of efficacy and add-on benefit of aprepitant were observed for all age groups with 
regard to proportions achieving Complete response in the three study phases.  
Overall across age groups, the demonstrated add-on efficacy in terms of Complete response is 
considered clinically relevant, with differences compared with the control arm at around 20% or above 
in the delayed and overall phases, while often smaller in the acute phase.  
The largest treatment effects were observed in the 12-17 year age group, receiving the adult 
aprepitant regimen, with absolute differences between arms of approximately 30% for the overall 
phase and 40% for the delayed phase (increased x 5, from 10 to 51%). 
In the age group 6-11 years (n=84), the add-on benefit of aprepitant appeared generally somewhat 
lower, however, with 14% difference between arms in the delayed phase, compared to 22, 18, and 
41% differences in the other age groups (6 m-2 y, 2-6y, 12-17y, respectively). This observation 
coincides with a lower mean AUC predicted in this age group compared with the other paediatric age 
groups by the population PK model based on studies P134, P097 and P148. Further PK-PD modelling 
analysis indicated that increasing doses on Day 2 and 3 in children under the age of 12 could increase 
concentrations to be more in the adult range; however available data are not sufficient to conclude 
that this would lead to clinically relevant improvements in outcomes. No change in dosing 
recommendations is therefore requested.  
Supportive studies 
The results of studies P134 (subset of main interest was part IV in ages 6-months-11 years receiving 
powder for oral solution) and P097 (adolescents receiving adult aprepitant regimen), both in the CINV 
indication, are considered supportive of the results of the pivotal study P208. Efficacy endpoints were 
exploratory in these studies.  
The results from P148 were not sufficient to determine a final paediatric dosing recommendation in the 
PONV indication and did not indicate superior efficacy compared with ondansetron. With regard to 
efficacy, P148 is only relevant to the suggested SmPC changes for the EMEND 40 mg capsules (PONV 
EMEND 
Assessment report  
Page 63/100 
 
 
 
indication), where no new indication or new posology is proposed. The outcomes of the study are 
considered appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The demonstrated add-on efficacy of EMEND (aprepitant) to an antiemetic regimen consisting of the 5-
HT3 inhibitor ondansetron with or without dexamethasone in paediatric patients in terms of Complete 
response (no vomiting/retching and no use of rescue medication) is considered clinically relevant, with 
increased proportions around 20% or more in the delayed and overall phases. The differences between 
arms were larger for the secondary endpoint No vomiting, where supportive rescue medication was not 
included as an event.  
The superiority criterion for the primary objective was met (one-sided p-value < 0.025). While some 
differences in the magnitude of effect were seen in subgroups, the overall results of the pivotal study 
P208 are consistent across endpoints, study phases, analysis populations and methods, and therefore 
considered robust and convincing for the proposed extension of indication.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The purpose of this application is to support approval for the use of aprepitant for the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the pediatric population. Exposure to aprepitant 
in this application includes a 3-day oral regimen with aprepitant in a powder for suspension (PFS) for 
children 6 months to <12 years of age and the oral aprepitant capsules (adult formulation) in 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age along with a 5-HT3 antagonist with or without dexamethasone. This 
regimen was investigated in 3 clinical studies:

As the MK-0869-208 (Phase III, Efficacy and Safety) is the pivotal study and comprises the majority of 
patients, main focus will be on this study whereas data from MK-0869-097 and MK-0869-134 will be 
regarded as supportive.  
Data presented below refers to study 208 unless otherwise noted.

A table showing exposure in the various age groups (6 months to<2y, 2y to <6y, etc) may have been 
more relevant, but almost all patients in study 208 fulfilled study treatment in Cycle 1 as seen in the 
table.  
In the table below from module 2.7.4, exposure in the various paediatric age-groups is shown. For the 
combined group of patients from studies 208 and 097, all patients <12 years of age are from study 
208 as study 097 enrolled only adolescents 12 to 17 years.

Subjects in Part IV of Study 134 were 6 months to <12 years of age and received aprepitant in the 
same regimen as in Studies 208 and 097. 
Extent of Exposure - Ondansetron Cycle 1 
All randomized subjects were required to receive ondansetron on Day 1; branded ondansetron 
(ZofranTM) was required in Cycle 1. The dose of ondansetron was determined by the investigator 
based on the product label for pediatric usage or local standard of care.

Subjects receiving multi-day chemotherapy were permitted to receive preventative antiemetic 
treatment with ondansetron after Day 1 on days that chemotherapy was administered, if clinically

indicated and consistent with local standard of care. Once the chemotherapy regimen was complete, 
ondansetron was no longer permitted as prophylactic treatment. Ondansetron exposure when used as 
rescue medication is not reflected in this table. 
Extent of Exposure - Dexamethasone Cycle 1 
Subjects  in  both  treatment  regimens  were  permitted  to  receive  preventative  antiemetic 
treatment with intravenous dexamethasone on each day that chemotherapy was administered, at the 
discretion of the investigator. Once the chemotherapy regimen was complete, dexamethasone was no 
longer permitted as prophylactic treatment. 
The dose of dexamethasone was determined by the investigator based on the product label for 
pediatric usage or local standard of care. If dexamethasone was administered to a subject randomized 
to receive aprepitant, the dose of intravenous dexamethasone to be administered was reduced by 50% 
on Days 1-4 due to the effects of aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone 
Table 28. Extent of Exposure to Dexamethasone by Dose for Aprepitant Regimen <Cycle 1> 
Table 29. Extent of Exposure to Dexamethasone by Dose for Control Regimen <Cycle 1> 
Exposure of the co-medications ondansetron and dexamethasone was similar in the 2 arms during 
cycle 1, except the lower dose of dexamethasone prescribed for subjects in the experimental arm.

In both protocols  208  and  097,  eligible  subjects  had  the  opportunity  to  receive  open-label 
aprepitant in subsequent cycles identical to the aprepitant treatment plan in Cycle 1 (up to 6 cycles in 
Protocol 208 and up to 10 cycles in Protocol 097), if they elected to participate. Many subjects did not 
participate in all additional cycles for a variety of reasons, such as completion of chemotherapy cycles,  
lack  of  response  to  chemotherapy,  progression  of cancer, and/or chemotherapy side effects.

The duration of exposure to aprepitant has been further clarified following the D120 LoQ. Patients in 
P148 were exposed to aprepitant on a single day, and patients in P134 were exposed for a maximum 
of 3 days in conjunction with a single cycle of chemotherapy resulting in a higher number of subjects 
exposed from 1-3 days. Exposures in the two studies that offered an open – label extension for 
subsequent chemotherapy cycles allowed for exposures up to 18 days in P208 and up to 30 days in 
P097. This explains why the majority of paediatric subjects (comprising all studies and all formulations) 
had an exposure of 1-3 days. 
In study 208 a similar number of subjects from each Cycle 1 treatment regimen entered the optional 
Cycles 2-6: 83 subjects from the aprepitant regimen and 88 subjects from the control regimen elected 
to participate in the optional cycles.  
Assessment report  
Page 70/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 37 Number of Subjects in Each Cycle, Cycles 2-6 
The purpose of the optional extensions was primarily to provide additional supportive evidence for the 
safety and tolerability of the aprepitant regimen, in support of the primary evidence derived from the 
controlled portion of the study (Cycle 1). Discontinuations during the optional extensions could in 
theory bias the interpretation of these supportive data, given the overall similarities in the 
safety/tolerability profiles between Cycle 1 and the optional extension cycles. 
Adverse events

Table 34. Adverse Event Summary by Age Category <Cycle 1> 
Assessment report  
Page 71/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events were reported by 236 (78.1%) of the 302 subjects included in the safety analysis and 
were comparable between the treatment regimens. In general, the adverse event profile observed was 
typical of a patient population with cancer receiving emetogenic chemotherapy. 
Table 12-9 displays the adverse events summary by age category and treatment group. Although 
some variability was observed for the incidence of serious adverse events between the treatment 
regimens and age categories, there was no consistent pattern noted within an age category or specific 
adverse event. All other adverse event subgroups appear similar between treatment groups. 
Table 35. Adverse Event Summary <Cycles 2-6> 
Table 36. Adverse Event Summary by Age Category <Cycles 2-6> 
As for treatment cycle 1, there was no consistent pattern noted within an age category or specific 
adverse event. Most AE categories occurred in somewhat higher percentages during cycles 2-6 than 
during cycle 1, which may be expected due to the larger cumulative exposure of chemotherapy.  
Following the CHMP’s request during this evaluation, the MAH also provided tables summarizing 
incidences of severe (grade 3-5) AEs in the aprepitant and control arms, and age the groups in 
respective arms. A similar table has also been presented for cycles 2-6. In cycle 1 there was some 
variability observed for the incidence of serious adverse events between the treatment regimens and 
age categories, but no consistent pattern was noted within an age category or specific adverse event. 
Assessment report  
Page 72/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In cycles 2-6, the adverse event profile was generally similar to that observed in Cycle 1, and no new 
safety signals were identified based on toxicity grading. 
Overall adverse events 
The adverse events mentioned above occurred at similar incidence between both treatment regimens, 
with the exception of anemia, which occurred at a slightly higher incidence in the control regimen. 
Overall, the adverse events observed were comparable to the types of adverse events observed in 
patients with cancer receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.

Adverse Events by National Cancer Institute Toxicity Criteria – Cycle 1 
The most commonly reported severe clinical adverse events (NCI Toxicity Grades 3 and 4) overall were 
febrile neutropenia, anaemia, and neutrophil count decrease. 
Assessment report  
Page 76/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 38. Subjects With Specific Adverse Events by Maximum Toxicity Grade (Incidence 
≥5% in One or More Treatment Groups) <Cycle 1> 
Assessment report  
Page 77/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In the table above, specific adverse events appear if the overall incidence of the event, regardless of 
grade, was ≥5%. In cases where only the System Organ Class (SOC) appears, e.g., ‘Infections and 
Infestations’, the incidence of adverse events from that system organ class was ≥5%, though not one 
single adverse event within that SOC reached that incidence.  
The severe clinical adverse events (NCI Toxicity Grades 3 and 4) seem overall similar between the 
arms. The incidence of the adverse event of anemia as measured by the NCI criteria was slightly 
higher in subjects in the control regimen as compared with subjects in the aprepitant regimen (16.7% 
and 7.9%, respectively) for Grade 3 toxicity. The incidence of anemia classified as a Grade 4 toxicity 
was similar between treatment regimens. 
Adverse Events by National Cancer Institute Toxicity Criteria – Cycles 2- 6 
According to the CSR 208, and as further clarified in the responses from the MAH, there were only 
small differences between the treatment arms for Cycle 1 and the adverse event profile in cycle 1 and 
cycles 2-6. The most frequently reported events were haematological (anemia, febrile neutropenia, 
neutropenia) and gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting) in nature. While these events occurred at a 
higher incidence in cycles 2-6 compared to cycle 1, this is not unexpected given subjects receiving 
multiple cycles of chemotherapy are more susceptible to experience more hematologic and 
gastrointestinal adverse events. The most commonly reported severe clinical adverse events (NCI 
Toxicity Grades 3 and 4) overall were febrile neutropenia and anaemia.

Drug related AEs were infrequent in both arms. No significant differences were seen between the arms, 
especially considering the context of concomitant emetogenic therapy. 
Drug-Related Adverse Events –Cycles 2 - 6 
Seven subjects (4.1%) had an adverse event that the investigator determined to be related to study 
medication (aprepitant and/or ondansetron). These events were mostly singular occurrences, except 
for ALT and AST increased (3 subjects each) and fatigue (2 subjects).

Two subjects in the aprepitant regimen had a serious adverse event that was determined by the 
investigator to be drug-related. A summary review of the serious drug-related adverse events is 
provided below: 
Assessment report  
Page 81/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A 1.2 year old female subject with a diagnosis of Yolk Sac tumor had a serious drug-related 
adverse event of Clostridium Difficile infection that occurred on the 3rd day post initiation of 
study medication (Day 3). The investigator considered this event related to aprepitant and 
ondansetron. The subject completed Cycle 1 then discontinued from the study. 
•  A 16 year old female subject with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma had a serious drug-related 
adverse event of electrocardiogram T wave inversion that occurred on the 8th day post 
initiation of study medication (Day 8), 5 days after the last dose of study medication. No 
concomitant medication or treatment was given to the subject for this event. The adverse 
event of “T wave inversion” was considered an “other important medical event”; the intensity 
of this event was mild and the NCI toxicity grade was 1. On Day 20, the subject’s ECG tracing 
spontaneously returned to baseline. The investigator considered this event possibly related to 
aprepitant and chemotherapy agents doxorubicin and cisplatin. The subject completed Cycle 1 
then discontinued from the study. 
No patients in the control regimen experienced a serious adverse event that was considered drug-
related.

Serious Adverse Events - Cycles 2 - 6 
Table 41. Subjects With Specific Serious Adverse Events By System Organ Class (Incidence 
> 0% in One or More Treatment Groups) <Cycles 2-6> 
Assessment report  
Page 83/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In general, the serious adverse event profile was typical of a patient population with cancer receiving 
multiple cycles of chemotherapy. 
The most commonly reported serious adverse events occurred in the blood and lymphatic system 
organ class, with febrile neutropenia occurring most frequently. 
One subject had a serious adverse event that was determined by the investigator to be drug- related: 
•  A 9 year old female subject with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma had a serious drug- related 
adverse event of anaphylactic shock that occurred on the 1st day of study medication in Cycle 
2. On Day 1 of Cycle 2, the subject received open-label aprepitant (3.48 mL powder-for-
suspension) and 12,000.00 mg of intravenous methotrexate. At the end of the methotrexate 
infusion, the subject experienced anaphylactic shock; the exact onset time of the adverse 
event relative to aprepitant and methotrexate administration was not provided. The intensity of 
this event was severe and the NCI toxicity grade was 4. The subject was treated with 
corticosteroids and recovered from the event in approximately 1 hour. One day later, the 
subject had another serious adverse event, which was methotrexate toxicity (“toxicity to 
various agents”). The intensity was moderate and the NCI toxicity was 2. The patient received 
hydration and leucovorin calcium and recovered within 8 days. The investigator considered 
both events (the anaphylactic shock and methotrexate toxicity) related to aprepitant and 
methotrexate. The subject was discontinued from study medication on Day 1 of Cycle 2. 
For adjudication of the possible relation of the anaphylactic shock described above and aprepitant, it 
has been clarified that the patient did not receive aprepitant in cycle 1. 
A combined table listing the most frequent SAEs for cycle 1 and cycles 2-6, respectively, has been 
provided by the Applicant following CHMP request. Similar to the non-serious adverse events, there 
were only small differences between the 2 treatment arms for Cycle 1. Incidence of SAEs were 
Assessment report  
Page 84/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
generally more frequent in Cycles 2-6, as expected due to the longer exposure both to aprepitant and 
to chemotherapeutic agents. 
Deaths 
One subject on the aprepitant regimen died: 
•  A 6 year old male subject with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma experienced a seizure 4 days post 
initiation of study medication in Cycle 1 (Day 4), one day after the last dose of aprepitant, 
which resolved spontaneously within 30 seconds. The adverse event diagnosis was ‘worsening 
neuroblastoma’. The investigator did not consider this event related to study medication. The 
subject completed Cycle 1, then discontinued from the study. The subject did not participate in 
Cycles 2-6. The AE of ‘worsening neuroblastoma’ was not resolved at the time the subject 
discontinued from the study. The subject died approximately 9 months after the subject 
discontinued from the study (298 days after the last dose of study medication was 
administered).  
There were no deaths in Cycles 2-6. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory Values Over Time – Cycle 1 
Summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) were calculated for baseline and post-treatment 
laboratory tests (selected tests only) for Days 6-8 and Days 19-29. No formal hypotheses testing was 
performed. Differences were noted from baseline for many of the laboratory safety tests, which were 
not unexpected given the effects of chemotherapy on bone marrow and liver function. Common 
changes for Days 6-8 included increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and decrease in platelet count. A small numerical difference in the mean 
change for ALT and AST is noted between the treatment arms, with the subjects in the aprepitant 
treatment regimen experiencing a greater change from baseline to post-treatment. 
There were no notable differences between groups with respect to mean alkaline phosphatase or total 
bilirubin. The mean change for platelet count decrease was generally similar between the treatment 
regimens. Changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and platelet 
count were less prominent by the Day 19 to 29 visit.  
The increase in AST Days 6-8 appear to be of the same magnitude as that of ALT, both here and when 
results are combined with study 097 (module 2.7.4, Table 55). Differences between the two treatment 
arms were less pronounced on Day 19-29. In the overall AEs (see above) there were no notable 
differences regarding elevation of liver parameters.  
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Toxicity Rating – Cycle 1 
Data from the protocol-specified laboratory safety tests performed at baseline (prior to study 
medication) and at the Day 6 to 8 and Day 19 to 29 visits were summarized using NCI toxicity criteria. 
Although tests were scheduled to be performed on Days 6 to 8 and Days 19 to 29, the visits may 
include lab data captured outside the scheduled visit window. 
The severity of laboratory safety test results were categorized using the standardized NCI common 
toxicity criteria. No formal hypothesis testing was performed. Based on the NCI toxicity criteria, the 
Assessment report  
Page 85/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
treatment regimens were generally similar across laboratory tests when taking into account differences 
at baseline. 
The laboratory tests with the greatest increase in NCI toxicity grade incidence from baseline to follow-
up were white blood cell (WBC) count (grade 4), hemoglobin (grade 3), neutrophil count (grade 4), 
and platelet count (grade 4). The increase in incidence for these laboratory tests were similar between 
the treatment regimens and are generally considered an expected result for patients receiving 
chemotherapy. 
Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities - Cycle 1 
The number of subjects whose laboratory values were outside pre-specified limits, as determined by 
using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (grade 3 and 4), for the period 
between Days 6 and 29 is presented in Table 12-24. 
Table 42. Number (%) of Subjects with a Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities 
(CSLA) - Cycle 1 Days 6 to 29 
Though some numerical differences in CSLA are seen, the changes are those generally expected in this 
population.

Laboratory Findings That Met Predetermined Criteria: Hepatic Safety – Cycle 1 
Table 44. Subjects With Liver Function Laboratory Findings That Met Predetermined Criteria 
All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) Population <Cycle 1 Treatment and Follow-Up Phase> 
Table 12-26 displays the number of subjects with a liver function test result during the treatment 
and/or follow-up period met pre-determined criteria. The normal range was defined at a site level by 
the site’s local laboratory. The incidences of subjects with alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) >10X 
and >20X the upper limit of normal were slightly higher in the aprepitant group (7/151 [4.6%] and 
3/151 [2.0%]) compared to the control group (3/149 [2.0%] and 1/149 [0.7%]). Of those with an 
elevation >20 times the upper limit of normal, all 4 subjects were treated with methotrexate, which is 
known to cause hepatotoxicity. No other hepatic parameter imbalances were noted. 
Thus, there was no patient with liver function test aberrations fulfilling Hy’s law.

Table 45. Subjects With Liver Function Laboratory Findings That Met Predetermined Criteria 
All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) Population <Cycles 2-6> 
Considering the concomitant chemotherapy given, the observed changes do not seem unexpected. 
Safety in special populations 
No dose adjustment of oral aprepitant is required based on gender, age, body weight or race. 
Additionally, no dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with renal insufficiency or for subjects with 
end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, or for subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
insufficiency (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9). There are no clinical data in subjects with severe hepatic 
insufficiency (Child-Pugh score >9). 
Immunological events 
Listings of subjects with hypersensitivity Adverse Events from the paediatric trials have been provided 
by the Applicant following the D120 LoQ. This includes a variety of AEs (eg “dermatitis allergic”, “rash”, 
“urticaria”) where only a single event is termed “anaphylactic shock”. In study 208, 10/19 
hypersensitivity AEs occurred in Cycle 1. In the listings of all AEs no clear difference is seen regarding 
hypersensitivity reactions between the 2 treatment arms and the causal relation to aprepitant remains 
uncertain. The current SmPC includes a precaution against hypersensitivity adverse events such as 
isolated reports of immediate hypersensitivity reactions including flushing, erythema, and dyspnea 
have occurred during infusion of fosaprepitant. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Current prescribing information contains extensive information on drug interactions for oral aprepitant 
in adults. The findings in adults are expected to be sufficient and relevant to the paediatric population.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Four subjects who participated in the open-label cycles discontinued study medication due to an 
adverse event: 
•  A 4 year old male subject with a diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma experienced febrile 
neutropenia 11 days post initiation of study medication in Cycle 3 (Day 11). The subject 
received 1.8 mL of aprepitant PFS on Day 1, then 1.2 mL on Days 2 and 3. The adverse event 
of ‘febrile neutropenia’ was considered a serious adverse event, moderate in intensity, with a 
toxicity grade of 3. The investigator did not consider the event to be related to study 
medication. The study medication in Cycle 3 was completed 9 days prior to the onset of the 
event; no action was taken with the study medication. The subject completed Cycle 3, then 
discontinued from the study. The subject was treated with cefotaxime sodium, amikacin, 
platelets, red blood cells, and acetaminophen, The subject recovered from the event of febrile 
neutropenia in 5 days. 
•  A 9 year old male subject with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma experienced four adverse events in 
Cycle 2, which led to discontinuation of study medication. On Day 1 of Cycle  2,  the  subject  
received  open-label  aprepitant  (3.92  mL  PFS)  and  methotrexate (13200.00 mg). On the 
same day, the subject experienced alanine aminotransferase increase (ALT; 2238.0 IU/L), 
aspartate aminotransferase increase (AST; 2738.0 IU/L), and lactate dehydrogenase increase. 
On the following day (Day 2 of Cycle 2), the patient experienced blood bilirubin increase (2.18 
mg/dL). The adverse event of ‘ALT increase’ was considered moderate in intensity, with a 
toxicity grade of 4, and resolved in 21 days. The adverse event of ‘AST increase’ was 
considered moderate in intensity, with a toxicity grade of 4, and resolved in 15 days. The 
adverse event of ‘lactate dehydrogenase increase’ was considered moderate in intensity, with a 
toxicity grade of 3, and resolved in 21 days. The adverse event of ‘blood bilirubin increase’ was 
considered mild in intensity, with a toxicity grade of 1, and resolved in 8 days. The investigator 
considered all four events related to study medication. Study medication was discontinued on 
Day 1 of Cycle 2. The subject discontinued from the study after the Cycle 2 follow-up visit. 
•  A 9 year old female subject with a diagnosis of osteogenic sarcoma [mentioned earlier under 
‘Serious AEs’] experienced four adverse events in Cycle 2, which led to discontinuation of study 
medication. On Day 1 of Cycle 2, the subject received open-label aprepitant (3.48 mL PFS) and 
methotrexate (12000.0 mg). One the same day, the subject experienced ALT increase (1059.0 
IU/L), AST increase (2031.0 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase increase (1070.0 IU/L), and 
anaphylactic shock. The adverse event of ‘ALT increase’ was considered moderate in intensity, 
with a toxicity grade of 4, and resolved in 16 days. The adverse event of ‘AST increase’ was 
considered moderate in intensity, with a toxicity grade of 4, and resolved in 11 days. The 
adverse event of ‘lactate dehydrogenase increase’ was considered moderate in intensity, with a 
toxicity grade of 1, and resolved in 10 days. The adverse event of ‘anaphylactic shock’ was 
considered severe in intensity, with a toxicity grade of 4, and resolved in 1 hour. The 
investigator considered all four events related to study medication. Study medication was 
discontinued on Day 1 of Cycle 2.  The subject discontinued from the study after the Cycle 2 
follow-up visit. 
•  A 6 year old female subject with a diagnosis of gliosarcoma experienced a convulsion in Cycle 
2, which led to discontinuation of study medication. The event of ‘convulsion’ was considered 
moderate in intensity, with a toxicity grade of 1. The investigator considered the event related 
to study medication. The study medication was discontinued on Day 2. The subject was treated 
with acetazolamide, carbamazepine, and topiramate. The subject discontinued from the study 
after the Cycle 2 follow-up visit. The event of convulsion resolved in 2 days.

In 3 of the 4 cases the investigator considered that the AEs were related to aprepitant, but it is not 
clear whether a causal relation was classified as possible, probable, or certain. In each case, the 
withdrawal of the patient from study seems reasonable as an act of caution. However, it seems likely 
that other factors, notably the patient’s medical condition and/or concomitant chemotherapy, may at 
least have contributed to these adverse events. 
Post marketing experience 
From post-marketing experience of aprepitant, a total of 47 reports contained 90 (28; [31%] serious) 
adverse events in the pediatric population. Most reported events were single occurrences, many of 
which are already labelled, and the findings do not by themselves suggest the existence of significant 
unidentified risks. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the paediatric studies in CINV 208, 097 and Part IV of 134, a total of 308 paediatric patients have 
been exposed to aprepitant. During cycle 1, aprepitant was always combined with ondansetron and 
sometimes with dexamethasone. In study 208, AEs were recorded in 79 % and 77 % in the aprepitant 
and control arm, respectively. Serious AEs were observed in 30 % of subjects in the aprepitant arm 
and 27 % of subjects in the control arm. There were no clear differences in the incidence of severe 
AEs, ie grade ≥3, in the two arms or in separate age groups. Likewise there are no obvious differences 
seen when the incidence of various AEs are presented by Maximum Toxicity Grade. 
No clear differences between the aprepitant and control arms are seen when AEs are summarised by 
system organ class. The most commonly reported adverse events from both treatment groups were 
within the blood and lymphatic system organ class, most notably anemia (20.9%), febrile neutropenia 
(15.9%), and neutropenia (12.9%), as well as gastrointestinal disorder of vomiting (15.2%). Vomiting 
was only reported as an adverse event if the vomiting episode occurred outside of the efficacy 
assessment period, or if the vomiting met the criteria of a serious adverse event. 
The adverse events mentioned above occurred at similar incidence between both treatment regimens, 
with the exception of anemia, which occurred at a slightly numerically higher incidence in the control 
regimen. 
Overall, the adverse events observed were comparable to the types of adverse events expected in 
patients with cancer receiving emetogenic chemotherapy. Listings of subjects with hypersensitivity 
Adverse Events from the paediatric trials have been provided. This includes a variety of AEs (eg 
“dermatitis allergic”, “rash”, “urticaria”) where only a single event is termed “anaphylactic shock”. In 
study 208, 10/19 hypersensitivity AEs occurred in Cycle 1. In the listings of all AEs no clear difference 
is seen regarding hypersensitivity reactions between the 2 treatment arms and the causal relation to 
aprepitant remains uncertain. The current SmPC includes a precaution against hypersensitivity adverse 
events such as isolated reports of immediate hypersensitivity reactions including flushing, erythema, 
and dyspnea have occurred during infusion of fosaprepitant. 
Transaminase increases in the aprepitant arm, >10X and >20X the upper limit of normal were slightly 
higher in the aprepitant group (7/151 [4.6%] and 3/151 [2.0%]) compared to the control group 
(3/149 [2.0%] and 1/149 [0.7%]). Of those with an elevation >20 times the upper limit of normal, all 
4 subjects were treated with methotrexate, which is known to cause hepatotoxicity.  
Assessment report  
Page 91/100 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In general, the differences in AEs between the arms in study 208 were small and of doubtful 
significance, not least in regard of concomitant chemotherapy. However, the clinical studies only 
describe short-term exposure to aprepitant. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In the clinical paediatric studies of aprepitant for the treatment of CINV, safety and tolerability of 
aprepitant combined with ondansetron and optional dexamethasone seems moderate and on par with 
that of only ondansetron with optional dexamethasone. The toxicity profile of aprepitant includes 
anemia, febrile neutropenia, vomiting, neutropenia, nausea, and neutrophil count decreased reflecting 
a typical patient population with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The somewhat higher incidences of 
anemia and neutrophil count decrease (control regimen) and dizziness (aprepitant regimen) do not 
lead to a concern. No new safety concerns in paediatric subjects as compared to adults were identified 
in the current clinical studies.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that study P097 and study P134 which are contained in the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan, P/0008/2014 and have been completed after 26 January 2007, are 
considered as significant. 
According to the criteria for assessing the significance of studies pursuant to article 45(3) of the 
paediatric regulation it is concluded that study P097 fulfils the following criterion for “significance”: 
• 
comparative efficacy studies (randomised/active control or placebo) 
According to the criteria for assessing the significance of studies pursuant to article 45(3) of the 
paediatric regulation it is thus concluded that Study P134 fulfils two of the criteria for “significance”: 
• 
• 
dose-finding studies; 
studies to obtain a new age-appropriate formulation, if this is expected to be of clinical 
relevance for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product in the paediatric population 
P134 cover several paediatric subsets, except the one for which a waiver has been granted (0-6 
months). Both studies P097 and P134 are considered supportive for the claimed indication.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The pivotal study for the present application is Protocol 208 (P208). This was a 1:1-randomised, 
double-blind, phase III, multicentre study that included paediatric patients aged 6 months - 17 years 
of age with a documented malignancy undergoing moderate – very high emetogenic chemotherapy 
(VHEC). Subjects were randomized to receive either aprepitant in combination with ondansetron 
(aprepitant regimen) or ondansetron alone (control regimen). Children less than 12 years of age 
received aprepitant as a new liquid oral formulation, powder for suspension (PFS), while patients aged 
12-17 received the adult regimen with hard capsules. All subjects received 3 days of aprepitant. 
Intravenous (IV) dexamethasone was given at the discretion of the investigator. Randomization was 
stratified into one of four age cohorts, and further by planned use of a VHEC chemotherapy agent and 
planned use of dexamethasone as part of the antiemetic regimen in Cycle 1. Efficacy was evaluated in 
a single cycle (Cycle 1). Optional open-label aprepitant was offered in the extension phase (Cycles 2 to 
6). The predefined definition of superiority was purely statistical requiring that a one-sided p-value < 
0.025 was met. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The primary endpoint was Complete response, defined as the proportion of patients with no vomiting, 
no retching or dry heaves, and no use of rescue medication in the 25 to 120 hours following the 
initiation of emetogenic chemotherapy (delayed phase) of Cycle 1. In the ITT population, complete 
response in the delayed phase was achieved in 50.7% vs. 26.0% (p<0.0001) of patients in the 
aprepitant and control regimens, respectively. I.e. the proportion with Complete response was 
approximately doubled (with an absolute difference of 25%). The proportion with Complete response 
was also doubled (from 20 to 40%, nominal p=0.0002) in the overall phase (0-120 hours after 
chemotherapy start), and increased by one fourth (from 52 to 66%, nominal p=0.0135) in the acute 
phase (0-24 hours after start). 
The Complete response results for the three study phases in the ITT population by the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) test method (primary endpoint, primary analysis population, and primary 
analysis method) were supported by very similar results in the FAS and PP populations, as well as by 
the results achieved using a logistic regression model. As such, the results of the primary endpoint are 
considered robust. 
The results from the secondary endpoint No vomiting further supported the primary endpoint with very 
similar (slightly larger) and highly statistically significant differences (by nominal p-values only) 
between arms in the proportions of patients responding (i.e. having no vomiting) in all three phases.  
The secondary endpoint Number of emetic episodes showed that in both the acute and delayed phase, 
the largest difference between arms was seen in the category with more than 3 emetic episodes, while 
smaller differences or similar proportions were seen for the categories with 1, 2 or 3 emetic episodes. 
Thus, there is a relevant magnitude of effect in the group with the worst problems. 
The estimated median time to first vomiting was 94.5 hours in the aprepitant regimen group compared 
with 26.0 hours in the control regimen group (nominal p<0.0001, based on log-rank test).  
Subgroup analyses 
The add-on effect of aprepitant was generally somewhat smaller in the acute phase compared with the 
delayed and overall phases, in females than in males, and in patients receiving chemotherapy over 
Assessment report  
Page 95/100 
 
  
  
 
 
more than one day compared with 1-day regimens. The magnitude of effect was largest in the 12-17 
age group (including an x 5 increase from 10 to 51% in the delayed phase), and appeared smaller in 
the group aged 6-11 years, with only 8% absolute difference between arms in the overall phase. The 
difference in the acute and delayed phases was larger, however, 14% and 17%, respectively. 
Supportive studies 
The exploratory efficacy results of studies P134 (including patients 6-months-11 of age years receiving 
powder for oral solution) and P097 (adolescents receiving adult aprepitant regimen), both in the CINV 
indication, are considered supportive of the results of the pivotal study P208.  
Concerning post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), the results from P148 were not sufficient to 
determine a final paediatric dosing recommendation for aprepitant in this indication and no benefit 
compared with head-to head ondansetron was shown. No new indication or new posology is proposed 
for PONV but the outcomes of the study are considered appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Pharmacokinetic data indicated lower exposure (AUC0-24) in all paediatric groups than what has 
previously been observed in adults, with the lowest mean AUC seen in the group aged 6-11 years, 
which also had the lowest response rate in the pivotal trial. Overall, children <12 years had lower Cmin 
values than adults. Further PK-PD modelling analysis indicated that increasing doses on Day 2 and 3 in 
children under the age of 12 could increase concentrations to be more in the adult range; however 
available data are not sufficient to conclude that this would lead to clinically relevant improvements in 
outcomes. Therefore no change in dosing recommendations is requested.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In the paediatric studies in CINV 208, 097 and Part IV of 134, a total of 308 paediatric patients have 
been exposed to aprepitant. During cycle 1, aprepitant was always combined with ondansetron and 
sometimes with dexamethasone. In study 208, AEs were recorded in 79 % and 77 % in the aprepitant 
and control arm, respectively. Serious AEs were observed in 30 % of subjects in the aprepitant arm 
and 27 % of subjects in the control arm. 
No clear differences between the aprepitant and control arms are seen when AEs are summarised by 
system organ class. The most common reported adverse events from both treatment groups were 
within the blood and lymphatic system organ class, most notably anaemia (20.9%), febrile neutropenia 
(15.9%), and neutropenia (12.9%), as well as gastrointestinal disorder of vomiting (15.2%).  
Anaemia occurred at a higher incidence in the control regimen (aprepitant regimen 27 (14.7%), 
control regimen 38 (22.6%)). Dizziness occurred more often in the aprepitant regimen 9 (4.9%) vs 1 
(0.6%) in the standard regimen. But overall, the incidences of the adverse events mentioned above 
did not suggest significant differences between both treatment regimens. Findings were similar in the 
supportive studies 097 and 134. Also, the safety pattern observed in paediatric subjects does not 
suggest any clear differences to that already known for adults. 
Listings of subjects with hypersensitivity Adverse Events from the paediatric trials have been provided 
by the Applicant following CHMP’s request. This includes a variety of AEs (e.g. “dermatitis allergic”, 
“rash”, “urticaria”) where only a single event is termed “anaphylactic shock”. In study 208, 10/19 
Assessment report  
Page 96/100 
 
  
  
 
 
hypersensitivity AEs occurred in Cycle 1. In the listings of all AEs no clear difference is seen regarding 
hypersensitivity reactions between the 2 treatment arms and the causal relation to aprepitant remains 
uncertain. The current SmPC includes a precaution against hypersensitivity adverse events such as 
isolated reports of immediate hypersensitivity reactions including flushing, erythema, and dyspnoea 
have occurred during infusion of fosaprepitant. 
In total, there were 2 patients in cycle 1 who discontinued study medication due to an AE in the 
aprepitant arm, whereas no subjects in the control regimen discontinued study medication due to an 
AE. Four subjects discontinued study treatment (i.e. aprepitant) in cycles 2-6 due to AEs. These 
discontinuations may be due to a reasonable precaution taken by investigators in a clinical trial and do 
not necessarily implicate intolerability of aprepitant in the respective subjects. 
Transaminase increases in the aprepitant arm, >10X and >20X the upper limit of normal were slightly 
higher in the aprepitant group (7/151 [4.6%] and 3/151 [2.0%]) compared to the control group 
(3/149 [2.0%] and 1/149 [0.7%]) and liver enzyme increase is reflected in the SmPC. It is worthwhile 
to note that of those with an elevation >20 times the upper limit of normal, all 4 subjects were treated 
with methotrexate, which is known to cause hepatotoxicity.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There remains a possibility that the encountered safety issues represent mostly those seen during 
short-term exposure to aprepitant. Considering that aprepitant is for short term treatment this 
considered of minor importance.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The possibility of avoiding the very problematic adverse reactions of nausea and vomiting induced by 
moderately to very highly emetogenic anticancer agents is considered particularly valuable in children. 
As such, demonstrated improvement over standard antiemetic therapy is considered clinically relevant. 
The unfavourable effects were similar across treatment arms in Study 208, i.e. the addition of 
aprepitant to the ondansetron backbone did not add significantly to the toxicity profile of the anti-
emetic regimen. The added aprepitant ADRs are therefore considered unlikely to be of significant 
clinical importance.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall and across age groups, the demonstrated add-on efficacy in terms of proportion of patients 
achieving Complete response compared with the control arm, at around 20% or above in the delayed 
and overall phases, is considered clinically relevant. Similarly, the difference in median time to first 
vomiting of 68 hours is also of clear clinical value.  
In general, the ADRs of aprepitant appear minor, particularly in relation to the concomitant 
chemotherapy. Hypersensitivity reactions, although a concern, did not seem overrepresented in the 
aprepitant arm of study 208, and the observed reactions appear to have been generally manageable. 
Implemented routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient for informing the prescriber. 
The benefits of add-on EMEND (aprepitant) to an antiemetic backbone of 5-HT3 blockade 
(ondansetron) with or without a corticosteroid (dexamethasone) for the prevention of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients are therefore considered to outweigh the risks.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Any reduction in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is considered of clinical value, 
particularly in children and adolescents. The unfavourable effects were similar across treatment arms 
in Study 208 and are considered of marginal clinical significance especially in relation to those of the 
background of concomitant chemotherapy.  
While PK modelling indicate that increasing the dose on Days 2 and 3 in children less than 12 years 
could increase Cmin levels to be more in line with what was previously observed in adults, there are also 
other differences than pharmacokinetics between the studied paediatric and adult populations that 
could contribute to the differences in outcomes. It cannot therefore be unequivocally concluded that 
increasing the dose would lead to clinically relevantly better outcomes in children. As the B/R balance 
is clearly positive at the studied doses, no change of posology is required.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of 
EMEND 125mg powder for oral suspension in the Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with 
highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in children, toddlers and infants from the age 
of 6 months to less than 12 years, EMEND powder for oral suspension is given as part of combination 
therapy (see section 4.2) 
And  
EMEND 80mg and 125mg hard capsules in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with 
highly and moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adults and adolescents from the age of 12 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation for the new 
pharmaceutical form and the extension of the indication for the 80mg and 125mg hard capsules.

Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0008/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

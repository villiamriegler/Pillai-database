Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Mepsevii (vestronidase 
alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Mepsevii (vestronidase alfa), which 
details the measures to be taken in order to ensure that Mepsevii is used as safely as possible.  
Mepsevii’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Mepsevii should be used.  
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR) summary and the product information for Mepsevii.  
I. The medicine and what it is used for  
Mepsevii (vestronidase alfa) is indicated for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations of 
Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII, Sly syndrome). It contains vestronidase alfa as the active 
substance and it is administered by intravenous infusion every two weeks.  
This treatment should be supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the management 
of patients with MPS VII or other inherited metabolic disorders. Administration of Mepsevii should 
be carried out by an appropriately trained healthcare professional with the ability to manage 
medical emergencies.  
Further information about the evaluation of the Mepsevii’s benefits can be found in the Mepsevii’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Mepsevii, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the medicinal product risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for a medicinal product include:  
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, advice on administration and 
undesirable effects in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;  
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (with 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. 
Additionally, the prospective, longitudinal program (UX003-CL401) is planned to assess the long-
term effectiveness and safety of Mepsevii in treated patients with MPS VII.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Mepsevii is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” below.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Mepsevii are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Mepsevii. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based 
on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected.

•  Assess long-term effectiveness of Mepsevii in patients with MPS VII.  
•  Assess long-term safety of Mepsevii including hypersensitivity reactions and immunogenicity in

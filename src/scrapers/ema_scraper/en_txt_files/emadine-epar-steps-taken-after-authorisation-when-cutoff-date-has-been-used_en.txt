In accordance with Article 10(3) of Council Directive 92/27 EEC of 31 March 1992, the EMEA 
issued on 4 February 1999 a Notification for deletion of the second repetition of the term ‘eye 
drops  solution’  on  the  labels  and  in  addition  minor  linguistic  changes  to  the  package  leaflets. 
The Commission amended the Commission Decision on 16 March 1999. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  on  15  February  1999  a  Corrigendum  to  the 
Danish SPC in order to rectify the missing shelf life in section 6.3. The Commission amended 
the Commission Decision on 4 March 1999. 
On  13 March 2000 the Marketing Authorisation  Holder submitted an application  for a Type  I 
variation  relating  to  a  change  of  the  manufacturing  sites  for  part  or  all  of  the  manufacturing 
process  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  procedure  started  on  15  March  2000.  The  EMEA  on 
24 March 2000  approved  this  variation,  which  required  amendments  to  the  Commission 
Decision. The European Commission amended the Decision on 31 May 2000. 
On  11  July  2000  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  6  applications  for  Type  I 
variations. Three variations relate to a change in test procedure of active substance. The fourth 
variation is for an extension of the retest period of the active substance and the fifth variation is 
a change in the name of a manufacturer of the active substance. The procedure for the first five 
variations  started  on  13  July  2000.  The  sixth  variation  is  a  minor  change  of  manufacturing 
process of the active substance. Additional information for this variation was requested and the 
procedure for this variation started on 17 July 2000. On 4 August 2000 the EMEA approved all 
six variations, which did not require amendments to the Commission Decision.

Regulation   (EC)  No 542/95  of  10 March   1995,  as  amended,  and  Annex   II  point  3  (iv).  The 
CPMP  during  its  February  2002  plenary  meeting  considered  the  application  acceptable  and 
issued  on  21  February  2002  a  positive  Opinion  for  granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for

required amendments to the Commission Decision, on 20 June 2002.  
On 7 October 2002, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a Type II 
variation  in  accordance  with  Art.  6  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  as  amended. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  applied  for  an  update  of  the  SPC,  Package  Leaflet  and 
Labelling in order to harmonise the multi-dose and single dose presentations of EMADINE eye 
drops  solution  and  to  harmonise  EMADINE  with  the  other  Alcon  products  approved  through 
the centralised procedure. Additionally, the Package Leaflet for the single dose presentation was 
amended  to  reflect  the  results  of  readability  testing.  The  CPMP  during  its  February  2003

Opinion  on the Type II  variation. The  corresponding  Commission Decision  was issued  on 19 
May 2003.

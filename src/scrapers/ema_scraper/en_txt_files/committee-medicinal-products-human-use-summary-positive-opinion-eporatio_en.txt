SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION* 
for  
EPORATIO 
International Nonproprietary Name (INN): epoetin theta 
On 23 July 2009 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion,** recommending to grant a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Eporatio, 1000 
IU/0.5 ml, 2000 IU/0.5 ml, 3000 IU/0.5 ml, 4000 IU/0.5 ml, 5000 IU/0.5 ml,10000 IU/1.0 ml, 20000 
IU/1.0 ml, 30000 IU/1.0 ml, solution for injection intended for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia 
associated  with  chronic  renal  failure  in  adult  patients  and  in  adult  cancer  patients  with  non-myeloid 
malignancies receiving chemotherapy. The applicant for this medicinal product is Ratiopharm GmbH. 
The active substance of Eporatio is epoetin theta, a recombinant human erythropoetin. Eporatio is an 
antianaemic  medicinal  product  that  stimulates  the  proliferation  and  differentiation  of  red  blood  cell 
progenitors, leading to more red blood cells and increased oxygen-carrying capacity. 
The  benefit  with  Eporatio  is  its  correction  of  anaemia  in  patients  with  chronic  renal  failure  and  in 
cancer  patients  with  non  myeloid  malignancies  receiving  chemotherapy.  The  most  common  side 
effects are hypertension, influenza-like illness and headache. 
A pharmacovigilance plan for Eporatio, as for all medicinal products, will be implemented as part of 
the marketing authorisation. 
The approved indication is: Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in 
adult  patients  and  treatment  of  symptomatic  anaemia  in  adult  cancer  patients  with  non-myeloid 
malignancies receiving chemotherapy.  
Detailed  recommendations  for  the  use  of  this  product  will  be  described  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SPC) which will be published in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
The  CHMP,  on  the  basis  of  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  data  submitted,  considers  that  there  is  a 
favourable  benefit  to  risk  balance  for  Eporatio  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation.

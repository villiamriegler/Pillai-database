Summary of the risk management plan for Omalizumab
This is a summary of the RMP for Xolair. The RMP details important risks of Xolair, 
how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained 
about Xolair’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Xolair’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Xolair should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP Xolair should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Xolair’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Xolair is authorized in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age) for 
IgE (immunoglobulin E) mediated Allergic Asthma. It is also authorized as add-on 
therapy  for  the  treatment  of  Chronic  Spontaneous  Urticaria  (CSU)  in  adult  and 
adolescent  (12  years  and  above)  patients  with  inadequate  response  to  H1 
antihistamine treatment. It is also approved for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis 
with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adult patients (18 years and above) with inadequate 
response  to  intranasal  corticosteroids.  It  contains  omalizumab  as  the  active 
substance  and  it  is  given  subcutaneously  every  2  or  every  4  weeks  for  AA  and 
CRwNP (75 mg to 600 mg according to body weight and baseline IgE levels) and 
every 4 weeks for CSU (300 mg) 
Further information about the evaluation of Xolair benefits can be found in Xolair’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website, 
under the medicine’s webpage link:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Xolair, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Xolair’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use,  in  the  package  leaflet  and  SmPC  addressed  to  patients  and  healthcare 
professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
•
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
•
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Xolair is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Xolair are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Xolair. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine 
is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected 
(e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Important identified risk: Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid 
reactions
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Although incidences of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid 
reactions in omalizumab clinical trials are rare, based on 
post-marketing experience a causal association between 
omalizumab and Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions 
has been established. In post-marketing reports, the 
frequency of anaphylaxis in patients exposed to Xolair 
use was estimated to be 0.2% based on a total number 
of anaphylactic reactions observed from an estimated 
exposure of over 500,000 patient years (SmPC). The 
post-marketing reporting rate remained stable over 
time and mostly ranged between 0.1-0.2/100 PTY. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Patients with previous history of anaphylaxis, children, 
atopic individuals and asthmatics.

Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma 
medicinal products, including omalizumab, may present 
or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These 
events are commonly associated with the reduction of 
oral corticosteroid therapy. No cases of CSS/HES was 
reported in clinical trials. All cases of CSS were reported 
in the post-marketing setting and the RR is 0.48/1000 
PTY.

Table 3
(ATEs)
Important potential risk: Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
A causal association between omalizumab and ATE 
events has not been established. In controlled clinical 
trials and during interim analyses of an observational 
study (EXCELS), a numerical imbalance of ATE was 
observed. In the final analysis of the observational 
study, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years was 7.52 
(115/15,286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients 
and 5.12 (51/9,963 patient years) for control patients. 
In a multivariate analysis controlling for available 
baseline cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio 
was 1.32 (95% CI 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of 
pooled clinical trials, which included all randomised 
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials lasting 8 
or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1,000 patient years 
was 2.69 (5/1,856 patient years) for Xolair-treated 
patients and 2.38 (4/1,680 patient years) for placebo 
patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.24-5.71).

Table 4

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
A causal association between omalizumab and 
malignancies in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of 
age has not been established. In the pooled clinical 
trials analysis, when adjusted for observation time, the 
rates of primary malignancy were 4.14 events per 
1,000 patient-years for omalizumab and 4.45 events 
per 1,000 patient years for placebo, with a RR of 0.93 
(95% CI: 0.39, 2.27). These results do not support an 
association between use of omalizumab and increased 
malignancy risk, a conclusion supported by  data from 
the EXCELS study:
In EXCELS, incidence RR of primary malignancies 
(Xolair to non-Xolair cohort) was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62, 
1.13).

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
A causal association between omalizumab and 
malignancies in children 6 to less than 12 years old has 
not been established. No cases of malignancy in 
patients treated with omalizumab were reported in any 
pediatric clinical trials. There were limited number of 
cases reported in the post-marketing setting and causal 
association with omalizumab could not be established in 
those cases.

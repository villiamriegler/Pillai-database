SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Delstrigo in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Based on two non-clinical studies, Section 5.1 of the SmPC 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of SmPC based on two non-
clinical studies (Study PD011: Assessment of in vitro 
antiviral activity against HIV-1 Resistant mutant, 
Y318F, alone and in combination with 12 other 
NNRTI mutants and Study PD012: In vitro antiviral 
activity of doravirine (MK-1439) Against a panel of 
viruses bearing NNRTI resistance-associated 
Mutations). In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in the

has been updated as follows: 
SmPC new text: 
Doravirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture 
starting from wild-type HIV 1 of different origins and 
subtypes, as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV 1. Observed 
emergent amino acid substitutions in RT included: V106A, 
V106M, V106I, V108I, F227L, F227C, F227I, F227V, 
H221Y, M230I, L234I, P236L, and Y318F. The V106A, 
V106M, V108I, H221Y, F227C, M230I, P236L, and Y318F 
substitutions conferred 3.4-fold to 70-fold reductions in 
susceptibility to doravirine. Y318F in combination with 
V106A, V106M, V108I, and F227C conferred greater 
decreases in susceptibility to doravirine than Y318F alone, 
which conferred a 10-fold reduction in susceptibility to

No new safety findings are reported as a result of the

multicenter, double-blind, randomized active 
comparator-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of doravirine/ /lamivudine/ 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate once daily compared 
with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate once daily in treatment-naïve HIV-1 
infected patients, as well as the study P018, a phase 
3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-
comparator-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of doravirine 
compared with ritonavir-boosted darunavir, each 
given in combination with emtricitabine/ tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate or abacavir/lamivudine, in 
treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to

consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
in combination with a ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted PI, or 
cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, or an NNRTI to Delstrigo 
was evaluated in a randomized, open-label trial (DRIVE-
SHIFT), in virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected adults. 
In the DRIVE-SHIFT trial, an immediate switch to Delstrigo 
was demonstrated to be non-inferior at Week 48 compared 
to continuation of the baseline regimen at Week 24 as 
assessed by the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 
40 copies/mL. Consistent results were seen for the 
comparison at Study Week 24 in each treatment group. 
Sections 5.1 of the SmPCs (Delstrigo, Pifeltro) have been 
updated with this data. 
The safety evaluation from this switch study did not reveal 
any new issues as compared to the safety findings in the 
prior pivotal studies. However, section 4.8 of the SmPC has 
been updated to include revised adverse reaction based on 
the Summary of Product Characteristics of 3TC and/or TDF.

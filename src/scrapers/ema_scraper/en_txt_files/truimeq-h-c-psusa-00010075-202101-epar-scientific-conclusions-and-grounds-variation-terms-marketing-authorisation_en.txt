Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dolutegravir, dolutegravir / 
abacavir / lamivudine, dolutegravir / lamivudine, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data mostly on spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal 
relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship 
between dolutegravir and “panic attack” is at least a reasonable possibility.  
The data available indicate that not only patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders are affected 
from this problem but also patients without any previously diagnosed psychiatric problems as well. Since 
there is enough evidence supporting a causal relationship between the administration of DTG-containing 
medicinal products and the onset of panic attack, the PRAC concluded the product information of 
product containing DTG should include “panic attack” as an ADR with a frequency allocation of 
‘uncommon’. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dolutegravir, dolutegravir / abacavir / lamivudine, 
dolutegravir / lamivudine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal 
product(s) containing dolutegravir, dolutegravir / abacavir / lamivudine, dolutegravir / lamivudine is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

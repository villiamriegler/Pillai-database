2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Exforge/Dafiro/Copalia/Imprida  is  an  oral  antihypertensive  product  consisting  of  a  fixed  dose 
combination  a  combination  of  valsartan,  an  angiotensin  II  receptor  antagonist,  and  amlodipine,  a 
calcium channel blocker.  
The approved indications are: 
“Treatment of essential hypertension. 
[Exforge/Dafiro/Copalia/Imprida]  is  indicated  in  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  adequately 
controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy.” 
The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure 
to a greater degree than either component alone. 
The amlodipine component inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular 
smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant 
effect  on  vascular  smooth  muscle,  causing  reductions  in  peripheral  vascular  resistance  and  in  blood 
pressure.  
Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively 
on  the  receptor  subtype  AT1,  which  is  responsible  for  the  known  actions  of  angiotensin  II.  The 
increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate 
the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor. 
The Marketing Authorisation for Exforge in the EU was granted  on 17 January 2007, for Dafiro on 18 
January 2007, for Copalia on 17 January 2007 and for Imprida on 17 January 2007.  
Exforge,  Copalia,  Dafiro  and  Imprida  have  been  marketed  globally  in  over  110  countries  since  2007.  
The currently approved doses of the fixed dose combination of valsartan/amlodipine in the EU are 80/5 
mg, 160/5 mg, and 160/10 mg. 
The purpose of this worksharing application is to update section 5.1 of the SmPC with additional clinical 
efficacy  data,  collected  from  five  completed  phase  3b/4  studies,  in  patients  likely  to  require  dual 
therapy including patients with stage 2 hypertension, patients not adequately responding to commonly 
prescribed  monotherapies,  and  specific  subgroups  including  black  patients,  diabetics  and  obese 
patients.  In  support  of  the  proposed  wording  on  consistent  efficacy  of  the  valsartan/amlodipine  fixed 
combination in obese and diabetic patients, reference is made not only to the 5 clinical study reports 
completed  since  marketing  approval,  but  also  to  5  clinical  study  reports  already  presented  in  the 
original marketing authorisation application.

the MAH took the opportunity to update the SPC in line with the latest QRD template and to update the 
contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet; 
-  Variation 3: Update of section 5.1 of the SPC with information on efficacy in patients not adequately 
responding  to  any  monotherapy  and  in  obese  and  diabetic  patients  based  on  studies  VAA  2401,  VAA 
2402,  VAA  2403,  VAA  2404  and  VAA  US02  (as  well  as  original  dossier  studies  VAA  2201,  VAA  2305, 
VAA 2306, VAA 2307 and VAA 2308). 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Clinical efficacy 
Variation 1 
The MAH proposed the following statement in section 5.1 of the SmPC as part of variation 1: 
“In two additional active-controlled studies of 1,612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects 
for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy 
including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and 
diuretics. 
Active controlled trials in stage 2 hypertensive patients 
Two active-controlled studies of 1,195 patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg 
and  <200 mmHg  were  conducted.  In  the  first  study  in  639  patients  (baseline  blood  pressure 
171/95 mmHg),  an  Exforge  regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  significantly 
reduced sitting blood pressure after 4 weeks by 30/13 mmHg compared to 24/9 mmHg with a regimen 
of amlodipine 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. The second active-controlled study, specifically designed to 
evaluate the efficacy of Exforge in 556 black patients, compared an Exforge regimen of 5 mg/160 mg 
force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  with  an  amlodipine  regimen  of  5 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg.  In  this 
4
  
 
 
study  (baseline  blood  pressure  171/98 mmHg),  Exforge  significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure 
after 4 weeks by 31/13 mmHg compared to 27/11 mmHg with amlodipine.” 
In  support  of  the  proposed  wording,  the  MAH  submitted  studies  VAA  2402  and  VAA2403  which  are 
summarized below:  
Study VAA 2402 
A  12-week  double-blind,  randomized,  multicenter,  parallel  group  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  orally  administered  valsartan  /  amlodipine  combination  based  therapy  versus  amlodipine 
monotherapy in Black patients with stage II hypertension. 
The  study  was  conducted  in  74  centres  in  Colombia,  Ecuador,  South  Africa  and  the  USA  from  June 
2006 to April 2007. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  superior  efficacy  of  the  combination  of 
valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  and  320/10  mg  treatment  regimen  in  Black  patients  with  stage  II 
hypertension, by testing the hypothesis that the valsartan/amlodipine combination treatment regimen 
produces a superior reduction in mean seated systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) from baseline compared 
to amlodipine monotherapy at Week 8. 
Inclusion criteria:  
- Black male or female outpatients ≥ 18 years of age.  
- Stage II hypertension, defined as MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and MSSBP < 200 mmHg, measured using a 
validated automated oscillometric device at Visit 2 at the study site. 
- Treatment naïve patients had a MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg and < 200 mmHg at Visit 2.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  change  from  baseline in  MSSBP  (mmHg)  at  Week  8  LOCF  and  was 
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).    
Secondary  efficacy  variables  were  change  from  baseline  MSDBP  at  Week  8  (last  observation  carried 
forward;  LOCF);  change  from  baseline  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  at  Weeks  2,  4  and  8  and  12;  overall  BP 
control rate after 12 weeks of treatment (MSSBP <140 mmHg and MSDBP <90 mmHg).

the  difference  between  LS  means, 
(valsartan/amlodipine vs. amlodipine) and two-sided 95% confidence interval were presented. 
The ITT population was used for analysis. 
Patient disposition by treatment strategy (Randomized population) 
The ITT population was defined as the randomised patients with at least 1 post baseline measurement 
and consisted of 278 (97.2% of randomised) in the valsartan/amlodipine arm and 278 patients (97.2% 
of randomised) in the amlodipine  arm. 
Protocol  deviations:  higher  in  the  amlodipine  treatment  strategy  (38.1%)  compared  to  the 
valsartan/amlodipine  treatment  strategy  (32.5%).  Most  of  these  were  major  protocol  deviations 
(24.1%  for  valsartan/amlodipine,  and  26.2%  for  amlodipine).  The  most  frequently  reported  major 
deviations were time of BP measurement < 20 or > 30 hours after the last dose of study medication 
(12.2% for valsartan/amlodipine; 14.7% for amlodipine), study drug interruption > 3 consecutive days 
prior  to  Visit  6  (4.2%  for  valsartan/amlodipine;  5.2%  for  amlodipine),  and  MSSBP  <  160mmHg  or  ≥ 
200 at Visit 2 (4.2% for valsartan/amlodipine; 3.5% for amlodipine). 
Baseline characteristics: The mean age was 53.2 years (SD 11.01), 96% of patients were <75 years. 
60.1%  were  females.  The  mean  (SD)  MSSBP  was  170.5  (9.27)  mmHg,  the  mean  (SD)  MSDBP  was 
98.3 (9.27) mmHg.

Patients received either amlodipine 5mg (uptitrated to 10mg at week 2) or valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 
mg  (with  uptitration  to  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  at  week  2).  This  is  not  in  accordance  with  the 
authorised indication.  
The  discontinuation  rate  was  rather  high  for  a  hypertension  trial,  13.6%  and  12.6%,  in  the 
valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  arms,  respectively,  and  approximately  25%  of  patients  having 
major protocol deviations. 
Patients were sufficiently balanced at baseline; a preponderance of females included is noted. 
The  study 
is  only  partially  relevant 
for  the  European  Union  setting  as  patients 
in  the 
valsartan/amlodipine arm were optionally uptitrated at week 4 to 320/10 mg, a strength which is not 
authorised in the EU.  The applicant has therefore focused the data review largely on week 4 since this 
was  the  last  visit  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  could  be  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg 
monotherapy.  However,  at  that  point  in  time  those  patients  had  not  received  the  antihypertensive 
treatment with valsartan/amlodipie 160/10 mg and amlodipine 10 mg for more than 2 weeks, which is 
not regarded as sufficient to judge its efficacy.  
In  summary,  it  is  acknowledged  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  seems  more  effective  than 
amlodipine  10  mg  in  the  treatment  of  systolic  hypertension  >160mmHg  and  <200mmHg  in  a 
population  of  Black  patients  that  was  either  treatment  naïve  or  was  treated  with  non-specified 
antihypertensives (i.e. not according to the authorised indication). However, a final judgement on this 
cannot  be  made  as  these  analyses  were  made  after  2  weeks  of  treatment  which  is  considered  too 
short.  Furthermore,  the  conduct  of  the  study  was  not  adequate  as  indicated  by  the  high  number  of 
discontinuations  and  protocol  violations.  This  study  is  therefore  not  considered  supportive  of  the 
proposed statement regarding Black patients with grade 2 hypertension. 
Study 2403: 
Patients were included if they had systolic hypertension >160 mmHg and <200mmHg corresponding to 
grade  2/3.  There  were  no  requirements  regarding  the  type(s)  of  previous  antihypertensive  therapy; 
also treatment naïve patients could be included.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  evaluated  at  week  4,  i.e.    2  weeks  after  forced  uptitration  of  the  drugs  in 
both treatment arms. This period is considered too short to evaluate the antihypertensive effect. Also 
according  to  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of 
hypertension (CHMP/EWP/238/95 Rev.2 and EMA//238/1995/rev.3) a tested dose should remain stable 
for at least 4 weeks.  
The  discontinuation  rates  were  comparable  in  both  treatment  arms;  approximately  10%  and  major 
protocol deviations occurred in around 14% of patients in either treatment arm. LOCF seemed not to 
be specified to be applied for the primary analysis.  
In  summary,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  seems  more  effective  than 
amlodipine  10  mg  in  the  treatment  of  systolic  hypertension  >160mmHg  and  <200mmHg  in  a 
population  that  was  either  treatment  naïve  or  was  treated  with  non-specified  antihypertensives  (i.e. 
not  according  to  the  authorised  indication),  a  final  judgement  on  this  approach  cannot  be  made  as 
these  analyses  were  made  after  2  weeks  of  treatment  which  is  considered  too  short.  This  study  is 
therefore  not  considered  supportive  of  the  proposed  statement  regarding  patients  with  grade  2 
hypertension.  
Thus, the provided studies are not considered sufficiently robust and are not in line with the authorised 
indication. As a consequence, the wording that was proposed by the MAH: 
10
 
"In two additional active-controlled studies of 1,612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects 
for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy 
including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and 
diuretics. 
Active controlled trials in stage 2 hypertensive patients 
Two active-controlled studies of 1,195 patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg 
and  <200 mmHg  were  conducted.  In  the  first  study  in  639  patients  (baseline  blood  pressure 
171/95 mmHg),  an  Exforge  regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg 
significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  30/13 mmHg  compared  to  24/9 mmHg 
with a similar regimen of amlodipine 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. The second active-controlled study, 
specifically  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  Exforge  in  556  black  patients,  compared  an  Exforge 
regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  with  a  similar  regimen  of 
amlodipine  5 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg.  In  this  study  (baseline  blood  pressure  171/98 mmHg), 
Exforge  significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  31/13 mmHg  compared  to 
27/11 mmHg with amlodipine." 
can therefore not be accepted.  
Variation 2 
The MAH proposed the following wording (underlined) in section 5.1 of the SmPC as part of variation 2: 
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5 mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema and amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/160 mg  produced  numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine 
10 mg  with  a  4-fold  lower  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema.  In  patients  adequately  controlled  on 
amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may 
achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.” 
In support of the proposed wording, the MAH submitted study VAA2404, which is summarized below:  
Study VAA 2404 
A  12-week  randomized,  double-blind,  multicenter,  parallel  group  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy, 
tolerability, and safety of treatment with the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared 
to amlodipine 10 mg in patients with essential hypertension not adequately controlled with amlodipine 
5 mg alone. 
The study was conducted from January to November 2007 in 148 centres in Germany, Spain, France, 
Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Argentina, Sweden, Norway, Ecuador, Finland, and Chile. 
The co-primary objectives of this study were: 
- To confirm that the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg is non-inferior to amlodipine 10mg 
alone when comparing the reduction of MSSBP from baseline to week 8 (LOCF) (Visit 4) between the 
two treatment groups (primary efficacy objective). 
-  To  confirm  that  the  combination  of  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5mg  induces  less  peripheral  edema 
compared to amlodipine 10mg alone up to Visit 4 (week 8) quantified as adverse event (AE) reported 
peripheral edema (primary safety objective). 
Inclusion criteria: 
- Male or female outpatients ≥ 55 years of age. 
11
 
 
-  Patients  with  essential  hypertension  measured  using  a  validated  automated  oscillometric  device  at 
Visit 1 (Non-treated patients had to have a MSSBP ≥ 140 mmHg and ≤ 160 mmHg and patients pre-
treated on monotherapy prior to Visit 1 had to have MSSBP ≤ 160 mmHg). 
- To be eligible for randomization at Visit 2 (Day 1) all patients had to have a MSSBP ≥ 130 mmHg and 
≤ 160 mmHg. 
- No peripheral edema at Visit 2 (randomization)

antihypertensive  medication  that  required  a  gradual  downward  titration,  the  tapering  down  was  done 
according to manufacturer’s instructions and the last dose was taken by week -2 prior to randomization. 
Primary efficacy variable: Change from baseline in MSSBP (mmHg) at week 8 LOCF.  
Secondary  efficacy  variables  were  the  change  from  baseline  MSDBP  at  week  8  (LOCF),  the  change 
from baseline in MSSBP and MSDBP at weeks 4, 8 and 12, systolic control rate (MSSBP <130 mmHg) 
at  weeks  4,  8  and  12,  systolic  response  rate  (MSSBP  <130  mmHg  or  ≥  20  mmHg  reduction  from 
baseline in MSSBP) at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and overall BP control rate (MSSBP/MSDBP <140/90 mmHg 
for non-diabetics and <130/80 mmHg for diabetics) at weeks 4, 8 and 12. 
For  the  primary  safety  objective,  investigators  also  evaluated  patients  for  the  presence  of  edema  at 
every visit. 
Statistical methods 
The  first  primary  hypothesis  for  non-inferiority  in  MSSBP  reduction  from  baseline  to  Week  8  LOCF 
between  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  and  amlodipine  10  mg  was  analyzed  using  analysis  of 
covariance  with  treatment,  region  and  diabetic  status  as  fixed  factors  and  baseline  MSSBP  as  a 
covariate for the ITT population. The non-inferiority margin was 3 mmHg. 
The  second  primary  hypothesis  for  a  difference  between  valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  with 
regards to the proportion of patients who developed peripheral edema up to and including Week 8 was 
analyzed  using  logistic  regression  with  treatment,  region,  and  diabetic  status  as  fixed  factors  in  the 
model for the Safety population.

***Visit 2 
Protocol deviations occurred in 40.7% of the patients in the valsartan/amlodipine group, and in 47.7 % 
of  the  patients  in  the  amlodipine  group.  Most  of  these  were  minor  deviations  (35.3  %  for 
valsartan/amlodipine;  37.2  %  for  amlodipine).  The  most  frequently  reported  major  deviations  (i.e. 
those  that  led  to  exclusion  from  the  Per  Protocol  population)  were  no  study  medication  taken  for  the 
last  3  days  prior  to  Visit  5  (2.5  %  for  valsartan/amlodipine;  7.4  %  for  amlodipine),  chronic  use  of 
NSAIDs  (3.5  %  for  valsartan/amlodipine;  4.9  %  for  amlodipine)  and  poor  compliance  (≤  80%)  with 
study medication (1.7 % for valsartan/amlodipine; 6.6 % for amlodipine). 
Baseline  characteristics:  The  mean  age  was  65.5  years  (SD  10.33),  86.7  %  of  patients  were  <75 
years.  51.9  %  were  males.  The  mean  (SD)  MSSBP  was  143.9  (8.09)  mmHg,  the  mean  (SD)  MSDBP 
was 83.8 (8.60) mmHg. 77.5 % had prior antihypertensive medication.

Peripheral  oedema  resolved  in  more  than  half  of  patients  who  switched  from  amlodipine  to

Furthermore,  during  the  procedure  in  response  to  a  CHMP  request  for  an  alternative  analysis  to  the 
pre-defined  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  analysis  performed  in  Study  A2404,  the  MAH 
performed  a  mixed-effect  model  for  repeated  measures  analysis  which  addressed  the  imbalance  in 
study discontinuations between the two treatment groups. 
During  the  preparation  for  the  mixed-effect  model  analyses,  inconsistencies  in  the  original 
programming  for  deriving  LOCF  values  in  the  ITT  analysis  (but  not  the  Per  Protocol  analysis)  were 
discovered. As a result, all of the original efficacy analyses related to blood pressure (i.e., change from 
baseline  in  msSBP  and  msDBP,  overall  BP  control  rate,  systolic  BP  control  rate,  and  systolic  BP

responder rate) were repeated using corrected efficacy datasets. The results of these revised analyses 
are  consistent  with  those  presented  in  the  original  CSR  and  type  II  variation  application,  and  are 
presented below.  
In addition, the per-protocol analysis results are in line with the original conclusions, indicating that the 
disproportionate discontinuation rate in the amlodipine group has not impacted the treatment effect. 
Study A2404 – Revised efficacy analyses 
At week 8 (LOCF), the primary analysis time point, a statistically non-inferior least square (LS) mean 
reduction  from  baseline  in  msSBP,  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  and  msDBP  was  observed  with 
valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 5 mg. 
These results are consistent with the LOCF analysis presented in the original CSR and type II variation 
application.

In  Study  A2404,  overall  BP  control  was  defined  as  BP  <140/90  mmHg  for  non-diabetic  patients  and 
<130/80 mmHg for diabetic patients. Systolic BP control was defined as msSBP <130 mmHg. Systolic 
BP  response  was  defined  as  msSBP  <130  mmHg  or  at  least  20  mmHg  reduction  from  baseline  in 
msSBP. 
At weeks 4 and 8, statistically significant greater overall BP control rates, systolic BP control rates and 
systolic BP response rates were achieved with valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg compared to amlodipine 
10 mg. At week 12, rates were numerically superior for valsartan/amlodipine compared to amlodipine, 
but no longer statistically significant as would be expected since patients in both treatment strategies 
had been receiving valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg from week 8 onwards. These results are consistent 
with the analysis presented in the original CSR and type II variation application.

Study 2404 – A mixed-effect model for repeated measures analyses 
Upon request from CHMP during the procedure, alternative analyses were conducted by the MAH using 
a  mixed  effect  model  for  repeated  measures.  These  analyses  confirmed  that  the  original  conclusions 
are  upheld,  indicating  that  the  disproportionate  discontinuation  rate  in  the  amlodipine  group  has  not 
impacted the treatment effect. 
The  new  analyses  use  a  likelihood-based  estimation  method  to  utilize  all  available  data,  including 
subjects with missing value. It accounts for the repeated measures structure in the data by adding the 
“visit”  and  “visit  by  treatment”  interaction  on  top  of  the  original  model  (i.e.,  treatment,  region,  and 
diabetes  status  as  factors  and  baseline  msSBP  as  covariate).  An  unstructured  covariance  matrix 
assumption  was  used.  The  patient’s  week  4  and  week  8  blood  pressure  reductions  were  included  as 
repeated measurements. Repeated measures analyses were performed for the change from baseline in 
msSBP, the primary efficacy variable, and msDBP, and are presented below. 
At weeks 4 and 8, a statistically non-inferior least square (LS) mean reduction from baseline in msSBP 
was  observed  with  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg  (primary  efficacy 
variable). The changes from baseline at weeks 4 and 8 were similar for both the valsartan/amlodipine 
and  the  amlodipine  treatment  groups  confirming  that  the  disproportionate  discontinuation  rate  in  the 
amlodipine group did not have an impact on the between treatment effects at week 8.

In  addition,  upon  request  by  the  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  the  MAH  clarified  the  fact  that  the 
already existing SmPC wording in section 5.1: 
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.”  
is  based  on  data  collected  from  the  two  multi-factorial  studies  [Study  A2201]  and  [Study  A2307] 
submitted as part of the original MAA for the fixed dose combination valsartan/amlodipine. 
Study  A2201  and  Study  A2307  were  both  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  multifactorial, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group trials. After a 2 week washout period, patients entered a 2-4 week 
single-blind  placebo  run-in  period,  followed  by  randomization  to  an  8  week  double-blind  treatment 
period  with:  placebo,  valsartan  monotherapy  doses,  amlodipine  monotherapy  doses,  and  the 
respective combinations of valsartan/amlodipine doses. Study A2201 and Study A2307 evaluated the 
lower and higher ends of the dose response curves, respectively. Patients were randomized with mild 
to  moderate  essential  diastolic  hypertension  (grades  1  or  2  WHO  classification  msDBP  ≥  95  mmHg 
and < 110 mmHg). The primary objective was to assess the blood pressure lowering effects of a once 
daily  regimen  of  the  various  combinations  of  valsartan  and  amlodipine,  compared  to  their 
monotherapy components and placebo. The primary efficacy variable was mean sitting diastolic blood 
pressure  (msDBP).  Both  trials  enrolled  male  and  female  outpatients  at  least  18  years  of  age. 
Exclusion criteria were very similar for both trials.

Study design (Study A2307) 
Baseline demographics and characteristics as presented in the table below were generally comparable 
between the two studies with the one exception of more Black patients enrolled in Study A2201 and 
more Oriental patients in Study A2307. 
Based  on  the  similarity  of  designs  and  study  populations,  qualitative  treatment  comparisons  can  be 
made  across  the  two  studies  after  correcting  for  differences  in  placebo  response.  Baseline 
msSBP/msDBP was 153/99 mmHg in Study A2201 and 157/99 mmHg in Study A2307.

amlodipine 10 mg (26/207, 12.6%). 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy - Variation 2 
Study 2404 
This  study  had  a  classical  non  responder  design.  Patients  included  were  >55  years,  and  had  mild 
systolic hypertension (grade 1).  
The  study  was  characterised  by  disproportionate  discontinuations  and  protocol  violations. 
Discontinuations  and  major  protocol  violations  were  considerably  higher  in  the  amlodipine  group; 
almost  20%  of  patients  discontinued  treatment  in  the  amlodipine  group  and  2.5%  of  patients 
discontinued  treatment  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  group.  The  majority  of  patients  in  the  amlodipine 
group discontinued treatment due to adverse events.  
Major  protocol  violations  occurred 
in  72  out  of  592  randomised  patients  (12%) 
in  the 
valsartan/amlodipine group and in 155 out of 591 randomised patients (26%) in the amlodipine group.  
22
 
 
 
 
 
The non-inferiority margin chosen was 3 mmHg for MSSBP. As this is a non-inferiority study also the 
PP  population is  relevant  for  the  analysis.  This  has been  provided  in  the  study  report  for  the  primary 
endpoint (see above) and complements the ITT analysis.  
The  primary  analysis  used  LOCF  in  order  to  account  for  missing  data.  However,  due  to  the  large 
difference in the rate of discontinuations between the 2 treatment arms (almost 20% in the amlodipine 
arm  vs.  2.5% 
in 
the  valsartan/amlodipine  arm), 
this  analysis  may  have 
favoured 
the 
valsartan/amlodipine arm.  
Upon  request  by  the  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  the  MAH  provided  revised  primary  LOCF  (ITT) 
analyses  for  Study  A2404  using  corrected  efficacy  datasets  as  it  was  discovered  that  there  were 
inconsistencies  in  the  original  programming  for  deriving  LOCF  values  in  the  ITT  analysis  (but  not  the 
Per Protocol analysis). All of the original efficacy analyses related to blood pressure (i.e., change from 
baseline  in  msSBP  and  msDBP,  overall  BP  control  rate,  systolic  BP  control  rate,  and  systolic  BP 
responder rate) were repeated using corrected efficacy datasets. 
Furthermore,  a  revised  analysis  for  change  in  BP  at  week  8  (ITT,  without  LOCF)  was  performed  in 
Study 2404.  
An additional mixed-effect model for repeated measures analysis was performed for Study 2404. 
The  proposed  wording  in  section  5.1  focuses  on  the  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  compared  to 
amlodipine  alone  in  the  context  of  oedema  incidence  rather  than  on  the  oedema  incidence  itself  as 
described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. According to the MAH, this information provided in section 5.1 is 
relevant  for  the  prescriber  as  it  presents  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  in  the  approved  doses  of  5 
mg/80  mg  and  5  mg/160  mg  as  a  benefit  in  relation  to  oedema  incidence  versus  amlodipine  in 
monotherapy. Thus, the proposed SmPC wording provides additional reassurance to the prescriber on 
efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine fixed combination in relation to oedema reduction. 
Oedema  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  amlodipine  monotherapy  group.  In  this  respect,  it 
should also be kept in mind that only patients 55 years or older were included in the study. Oedema is 
dose-dependent  with  amlodipine  therapy  and  the  clearance  of  amlodipine  is  reduced  in  the  elderly, 
resulting in a higher exposure. It is therefore likely that the incidence of amlodipine in this study may 
be exaggerated due to the chosen study population. 
The  MAH  acknowledged  that  patients  aged  55  years  and  over  were  selected  in  Study  A2404  to 
demonstrate the effect of valsartan/amlodipine compared to amlodipine monotherapy on the reduction 
of  oedema  incidence.  According  to  the  MAH,  as  recognised  by  guidelines  for  the  management  of 
arterial hypertension, the patient population selected in Study A2404 (≥ 55 years old) is representative 
of the hypertensive population at risk. Age (men >55 years; women >65 years) is considered a factor 
influencing  prognosis  of  cardiovascular  risk  and  should  be  used  to  stratify  the  risk  of  cardiovascular 
disease.  Older  patients  may  be  more  prone  to  develop  peripheral  oedema  on  non-dihydropyridine 
calcium  channel  blockers  due  to  the  effects  of  aging  on  the  peripheral  vasculature.  Therefore, 
according  to  the  MAH,  this  is  the  population  that  may  have  the  greatest  benefit  with  respect  to 
attenuation in the development of oedema but does not preclude a benefit in younger patients.  
It  is  reassuring  that  all  the  presented  analyses  are  consistent  and  yield  similar  results.  However,  it 
should  be  kept  in  mind  that,  albeit  statistically  significant,  the  differences  in  BP  reductions  between 
valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  and  amlodipine  10  mg  are  not exceptionally  different  and  there  is  no 
obvious reason to insert a statement on ”numerically greater reductions in blood pressure compared to 
amlodipine 10 mg”, derived from a not completely recognized subgroup of patients with hypertension 
(those >55 years), into section 5.1 of the SmPC. In spite of the fact that the age of >55 years is an 
agreed risk factor for males for CV disease (65 years for females), it is not recognized as a subgroup 
for hypertension trials.  
23
 
The SmPC guideline states on section 5.1:  
”…It  may  be  appropriate  to  provide  limited  information,  relevant  to  the  prescriber,  such  as  the  main 
results  (statistically  compelling  and  clinically  relevant)  regarding  pre-specified  end  points  or  clinical 
outcomes  in  the  major  trials,  and  giving  the  main  characteristics  of  the  patient  population.  Such 
information  on  clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should  summarise 
evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication. The magnitude of effects should be described 
using  absolute  figures.  (Relative  risks  or  odd  ratio  should  not  be  presented  without  absolute 
figures)….” 
Consequently,  as  mentioned  above  with  reference  to  the  SmPC  guideline,  the  efficacy  part  of  the 
proposed wording is not considered appropriate. Therefore, the proposed wording (highlighted):  
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5 mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema and amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/160 mg  produced  numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine 
10 mg  with  a  4-fold  lower  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema.  In  patients  adequately  controlled  on 
amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may 
achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.” 
is not acceptable to the CHMP and thus the context of the proposed safety information on oedema is 
not relevant. The existing information on oedema in section 4.8 of the SmPC is regarded sufficient for 
prescribers. 
Furthermore,  during  the  procedure  the  CHMP  questioned  the  validity  of  the  already  existing  SmPC 
wording in section 5.1: 
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.”  
Upon request by the CHMP, the MAH clarified that this wording was based on data collected from the 
two multi-factorial studies [Study A2201] and [Study A2307] submitted as part of the original MAA for 
the fixed dose combination valsartan/amlodipine. 
Following  the  assessment  of  all  data  provided,  the  CHMP  did  not  consider  it  appropriate  to  compare 
two  different  studies  in  order  to  obtain  a  statement  on  BP  results  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  The 
studies  are  not  considered  completely  comparable  with  respect  to  the  included  patient  population 
which is demonstrated by the differences in age categories (28.6% patients >65 years in study A2307 
compared  to  18.2%  in  study  A2201)  and  ethnic  origin  (10.4%  of  Black  patients  in  study  A2201  as 
compared  to  0.4%  in  study  A2307.  Study  A2307  had  in  contrast  a  higher  percentage  of  oriental 
patients, 13.7%, as compared to study A2201 (1.6%)). 
Following  the  CHMP  assessment  of  these  data,  the  MAH  acknowledged  the  CHMP  comments  and 
revised the current wording in the product information to more accurately reflect the data generated in 
the multi-factorial Study A2201 and Study A2307. However, according to the MAH, the percentage of 
patients  in  active  treatment  groups  achieving  BP  control  (msDBP  <90  mmHg)  could  be  considered 
similar  for  valsartan/amlodipine  80/5  mg  (39.1%)  [Study  2201]  and  amlodipine  10  mg  (37.5  %) 
[Study  2307]  after  adjusting  for  placebo  control  rates.  The  CHMP,  however,  considered  the  placebo 
control  rates  very  different:  33.9%  (studyA2201)  and  42.6%  (study  2307)  and  furthermore,  the 
24
 
 
 
MSDPB and msSPB reductions for amlodipine 10 mg do not seem comparable to valsartan/amlodipine 
80/5  mg  but  seem  to  lie  in  between  the  results  for  amlodipine  5  mg  and  valsartan/amlodipine  80/5 
mg. These facts indicate that it is not appropriate to compare the two studies with regard to BP results.  
Consequently, the suggested amendment to the existing wording as proposed by the MAH in response 
to the CHMP Request for supplementary information, to more accurately reflect the data generated in 
the  multi-factorial  Study  A2201  and  Study  A2307,  and  the  mentioning  of  the  age  range  to  avoid 
ambiguity regarding the population studied in Study A2404 was rejected by the Committee: 
“5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
(...) 
Amlodipine/Valsartan 
(...) 
 In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg  Patients  receiving  amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/80 mg  may  achieve  blood  pressure  control  similar  to  amlodipine  10 mg  with  less  oedema.  In 
patients  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema, 
amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema. 
In  an  additional  active-controlled  study  of  1183  patients  aged  55  years  or  older  not  adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/160  mg  produced  numerically  greater 
reductions in blood pressure compared to amlodipine 10 mg with a 4-fold lower incidence of peripheral 
oedema.” 
Moreover, the CHMP was of the view that the existing paragraph, although previously accepted by the 
Committee by mistake, should be removed from the SmPC since it was considered that the text might 
be misleading for prescribers. 
In conclusion, the wording suggested by the MAH as part of variation 2 is not acceptable to the CHMP. 
In addition, the already approved paragraph should for the reasons outlined above be deleted from the 
SmPC. As part of variation 2, the MAH took the opportunity to update the SmPC in line with the latest 
QRD  template  and  to  update  the  contact  details  of  the  local  representatives  in  the  Package  Leaflet, 
which is acceptable. 
Variation 3 
The MAH proposed the following wording in section 5.1 of the SmPC as part of variation 3: 
a) “In two additional active-controlled trials of 1612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects 
for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy 
including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and 
diuretics.” 
and  
b) “Age, gender, race, body mass index or diabetes status did not influence the response to Exforge.” 
The first part of the variation: 
a) With reference to efficacy in patients not adequately responding to any monotherapy, the MAH has 
submitted  studies  VAA  2401  and  VAA  US02  in  support  of  this  statement  and  these  studies  are 
summarised below:

Study VAA2401 
A  double-blind,  randomized,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  combination  of 
valsartan and amlodipine in hypertensive patients not controlled on monotherapy. 
The study was conducted in 118 centres in the USA, France, Spain, Canada, Norway, Belgium, Slovakia 
and Switzerland from February 2006 to January 2007. 
The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of patients reaching blood pressure (BP) control, 
i.e.  MSSBP  <140  mmHg  and  MSDBP  <90  mmHg  for  non-diabetics,  or  MSSBP  <130  and  MSDBP  <80 
for  diabetic  patients,  after  16  weeks  of  treatment  with  a  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10mg  treatment 
strategy or a valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg treatment strategy in hypertensive patients not controlled 
with monotherapy. 
Inclusion criteria:  
- Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age; 
-  MSSBP  of  ≥  140  mmHg  and/or  MSDBP  ≥  90  mmHg  (Non-diabetic  patients)  /  MSSBP  ≥  130  mmHg 
and/or MSDBP ≥ 80 (Diabetic patients ) at Visits 1 and 2;  
-  Patients  treated  with  monotherapy  at  a  dose  considered  as  adequate  by  the  investigator  for  a 
minimum of two months prior to Visit 1.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  blood  pressure  control  at 
endpoint (Week 16), defined as MSSBP/MSDBP <140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic patients or <130/80 
mmHg for diabetic patients. 
Secondary  efficacy  variables  were  the  proportion  of  patients  who  reached  blood  pressure  control  at 
Pre-HCTZ  Endpoint  (Week  8),  the  number  of  BP  controlled  patients  by  study  week;  change  from 
baseline in MSDBP and MSSBP, and diastolic BP control rate. 
Statistical methods:

All efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT population. The unadjusted control rates (expressed 
as  a  percentage)  for  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5mg  and  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10mg  at  Endpoint 
(Week  16,  LOCF)  were  presented  with  the  corresponding  asymptotic  two-sided  95%  confidence 
intervals. The proportion of controlled patients in each treatment group at endpoint was analyzed using 
a  logistic  regression  model.  Terms  for  treatment  and  diabetic  status  were  included  in  the  model 
(supplementary  analysis).  The  point  estimate  for  the  odds  ratio  (valsartan/amlodipine  160/10mg  vs. 
valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg) and two-sided 95% confidence interval were presented. 
The null hypothesis was rejected and superiority was established if the p-value <0.05.

The ITT population was defined as the randomised patients with at least 1 post baseline measurement 
and  consisted  of  440  (99.3%  of  randomised)  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5mg  arm  and  449 
patients (99.6% of randomised) in the valsartan/amlodipine 160/10mg arm. 
Protocol violations occurred in 24.8% of the patients in the valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg treatment 
strategy,  and  29.3%  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  treatment  strategy;  however,  few 
patients  had  major  protocol  violations,  and  they  occurred  at  similar  frequencies  in  both  treatment 
strategies. 
Baseline characteristics: Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment arms. The mean 
age  was  58.5  years  (SD  12.17),  89.6 %  of  patients  were  <75  years.  49.6  %  were  males.  The  mean 
(SD) MSSBP was 150.1 (10.11) mmHg, the mean (SD) MSDBP was 90.7 (7.65) mmHg. 
Prior  medication:  ARBs  39.4%,  ACE-inhibitors  22.1%,  beta  blockers  14.8%,  calcium  channel  blockers 
13.9%, diuretics 8.9%, other 0.9%. 
Results: 
Primary endpoint 
The  proportion  of  patients  reaching  BP  control  after  16  weeks  of  treatment  was  slightly  higher  for 
valsartan/amlodipine 160/10mg (74.8%, 95%CI 70.82, 78.85) than for valsartan/amlodipine 160/5mg 
(72.7%, 95%CI 68.57, 76.89). 
Supplementary  analysis: The  estimated  odds  of  being  controlled  at  Endpoint Week  16  were  1.35  and 
1.64  for  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  and  160/10  mg  treatment  strategies,  respectively.  The 
estimated  odds  ratio  for  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  versus  160/10  mg  was  0.82,  favouring 
valsartan/amlodipine 160/10 mg over valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg.

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  show  that  the  aggressive  Exforge  treatment  regimen  was 
superior  to  the  moderate  Exforge  treatment  regimen  with  respect  to  change  from  baseline  in  mean 
sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) at Week 4. 
Inclusion criteria:  
- Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age; 
-  Diagnosis  of  uncontrolled  systolic  hypertension  prior  to  study  randomization  on  ARB  monotherapy. 
Patients  must  have  had  a  MSSBP  ≥  150  mm  Hg  and  <  200  mm  Hg  ARB  at  Visits  1,  2,  and  3  while 
either  naïve  to  antihypertensive  treatment  or  on  any  single  agent  antihypertensive  therapy  or  on 
monotherapy for a minimum period of 28 days prior to randomization.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  mean  MSSBP.  The  main  analysis  time 
point was Week 4; other analysis time points were Weeks 2, 8, and 12. 
The key secondary efficacy variable was change from baseline in MSDBP. 
Statistical methods: 
To compare the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in MSSBP between the two treatment regimens, 
an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  was  utilized  with  baseline  MSSBP,  treatment,  olmesartan 
dosage  in  runin  phase,  and  sub-study  based  stratum  (Patients  were  classified  into  3  strata  based  on 
which type of center they belonged to. The centers that made up the 3 strata for the primary analysis 
29
 
 
 
 
were ABPM sub-study centers, AI sub-study centers, and centers that were neither ABPM (ambulatory 
BP monitoring)  nor AI (augmentation index) sub-study centers) as explanatory variables and with the 
change from baseline to Week 4 in MSSBP as the response variable. Based on this fitted model a two-
sided  95%  CI  for  the  mean  treatment  difference  between  the  two  treatment  regimens  and  the 
associated  p-value  was  obtained.  The  least-squared  means  of  each  treatment  arm  were  also 
computed.

The ITT population was defined as the randomised patients with at least 1 post baseline measurement 
and consisted of 366 patients (99.2% of randomised) in the high dose arm and 357 patients (99.4% of 
randomised) in the moderate dose arm. 
Protocol violations occurred in 24.8% of the patients in the valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg treatment 
strategy,  and  29.3%  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg  treatment  strategy;  however,  few

Second part of the variation: 
 b) With reference to efficacy not influenced by body mass index or diabetes status: 
This  proposal  is  based  on  subgroup  analyses  from  the  9  studies  that  support  the  efficacy  of 
valsartan/amlodipine in hypertensive patients regardless of BMI or diabetes status.   
This includes post-hoc analyses of 4 studies in the original submission [Study A2201], [Study A2305], 
[Study A2306] and [Study A2307], and the 5 studies completed since the marketing approval [Study 
A2401], [Study A2402], [Study A2403], [Study A2404] and [Study US02]. The continuous variables of 
change from baseline in MSSBP and MSDBP are displayed. 
Efficacy results by diabetic status: 
The definition of diabetes varied across studies.  In [Study A2401], [Study A2402], [Study A2403] and 
[Study A2404], diabetes status came from a specific question on the Medical History case report form.  
In [Study A2201], [Study A2307], [Study A2305], and [Study A2306] diabetes status was determined 
according to concomitant medication use at baseline and medical history, using WHODRL and MedDRA 
terms  in  place  at  the  time  of  the  original  Exforge  submission.    In  [Study  US02],  subgroup  analyses 
based on diabetes status at baseline defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dL vs. FPG ≤ 
126  mg/dL  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  variables.    Patient  diabetic  status  was 
determined  post-hoc  according  to  concomitant  medication  use  at  baseline  and  medical  history,  using 
WHODRL and MedDRA terms at the time of CSR completion. 
Efficacy  data  were  only  analyzed  within  each  study.    No  pooling  for  efficacy  analysis  was  performed 
because  of  the  differences  in  study  designs,  patient  populations,  and/or  doses  or  dosing  regimens 
across the trials.

The  table  below  presents  the  raw  mean  changes  from  baseline  at  the  primary  endpoint  (Week  8)  in 
MSSBP  and  MSDBP  by  treatment  and  diabetic  status  in  the  previously  submitted  placebo-controlled

The table below presents the raw mean changes from baseline at the primary endpoint in MSSBP and 
MSDBP  by  treatment  and  diabetic  status  in  the  two  trials  completed  since  the  marketing  approval  in 
patients with stage 2 hypertension.  The time points of interest are considered to be Weeks 4 and 8 in 
[Study A2402] (conducted in Black patients) and Week 4 in [Study A2403].  In study A2402, Week 4 
was important because it was the last visit that valsartan/amlodipine 160/10 mg was administered and 
Week  8  was  important  because  it  was  the  last  visit  before  HCTZ  could  be  added.    In  Study  A2403, 
Week  8  was  important  because  it  was  the  last  visit  before  HCTZ  could  be  added.    The  total  ITT 
population of [Study A2402] included 85 (15.3%) diabetics.  The total ITT population of [Study A2403] 
included 70 (11.0%) diabetics.  Greater reductions in both MSSBP and MSDBP were observed with the 
combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine  studied  compared  to  amlodipine  monotherapy  regardless  of 
diabetic status.

the ITT population of this study.  To be eligible for randomization in this study, patients had to have an 
inadequate  response  to  amlodipine  5  mg  with  an  MSSBP  ≥  130  mmHg  and  ≤  160  mmHg,  which  is 
lower  than  all  other  studies.    The  reductions  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  were  numerically  greater  with 
valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg than with amlodipine 10 mg regardless of diabetes status

obese patients.  The total ITT population of [Study A2307] included 384 (30.8%) obese patients.  The 
combinations  of  valsartan/amlodipine  studied  were  effective  in  reducing  MSDBP  and  MSSBP  in 
comparison  with  placebo  regardless  of  BMI  category.    Further,  for  the  vast  majority  of  combination 
dose  groups,  each  component  of  the  combination  therapies  appeared  to  contribute  to  the  total 
antihypertensive effect of the combination regardless of BMI category.

Week  8  was  important  because  it  was  the  last  visit  before  HCTZ  could  be  added.      The  total  ITT 
population of [Study A2402] included 321 (58.2%) obese patients.  The total ITT population of [Study 
A2403]  included  279  (43.7%)  obese  patients.    The  combination  of  valsartan/amlodipine  studied  was 
effective in reducing MSDBP and MSSBP in comparison with the active amlodipine control regardless of 
BMI  category.    The  mean  reductions  at  Week  4,  which  was  common  to  both  studies,  were  similar 
regardless of BMI category.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy - Variation 3 
Study 2401:  
The  study  was  not  conducted  in  line  with  the  authorised  indication  as  patients  with  any  previous 
hypertensive monotherapy medication could be included. Patients treated with monotherapy "at a dose 
considered  as  adequate  by  the  investigator"  for  a  minimum  of  two  months  could  be  included.  This 
inclusion criterion is not meaningful; it is too large and unspecific in order to allow for any conclusions 
to be drawn on the target population.  
At visit 2 (randomization) patients discontinued their previous medication and were randomized to the 
study medication; either val/aml 160/10 mg or val/aml 160/5 mg. Both treatment arms had the option 
to add HCTZ stepwise after 8 weeks if BP was uncontrolled.  
The difference in discontinuations is striking in both arms, being 17% in the 160/10 mg arm and 8% in 
the 160/5 mg arm. The main reasons for discontinuations were adverse events.  
The primary endpoint is not relevant for this variation as it is influenced by the addition of HCTZ. The 
applicant  has  also  presented  changes  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  from  baseline  at  different  time  points  in 
order  to  be  consistent  in  the  analyses  for  this  variation  application  (this  was  a  secondary  endpoint). 
However, this information is hardly relevant as there was no wash-out phase (before initiation of study 
treatment) and the baseline is an expression of previous varying monotherapy and dosages, i.e. not in 
accordance with the authorised indication. Furthermore due to the large differences in discontinuations 
between the treatment groups, LOCF may not be the appropriate way to address missing data.  
Study US02:  
Naïve  patients  and  patients  who  remained  uncontrolled  with  regard  to  systolic  hypertension  on  any 
single antihypertensive medication other than ARBs were eligible for the run-in phase (treatment with 
olmesartan 20mg and 40mg, respectively, for 28 days). Patients treated with ARB monotherapy (other 
than  valsartan  [Diovan])  for  28  days  who  remained  uncontrolled  were  eligible  for  the  double-blind 
phase. This means that the conditions prior to randomisation were different, either there was a run-in 
therapy with 2 different doses of olmesartan or patients could directly enter the double-blind phase if 
being  treated  with  another  ARB  than  valsartan  for  28  days.  This  is  not  in  line  with  the  authorised 
indication.  Apart  from  this  deviation,  only  one  of  the  treatment  arms  in  the  double-blind  phase  is 
considered relevant from an EU perspective. The "moderate" dose of 160/5 mg is authorised, whereas 
40
 
 
the comparator arm with the "aggressive" dose of 320/5 mg (with forced titration to 320/10 mg after 2 
weeks) is not. With reference to the 160/5 mg dose, only the first 4 weeks of the double-blind period 
are relevant due to the forced titration thereafter with HCTZ.  
Discontinuations were almost comparable between treatment groups, but discontinuations due to AEs 
were  doubled  in  the  160/5  mg  group  as  compared  to  the  320/5  mg  group,  which  appears  rather 
bizarre.  
Both  studies  (2401  and  US02)  that  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  proposed  change  in  5.1 
concerning  the  efficacy  in  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  any  monotherapy  including  ACE 
inhibitors,  ARBs,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and  diuretics  were  not  conducted  in 
accordance  with  the  authorised  indication,  i.e.  in  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  or 
valsartan monotherapy. This is not in accordance with the SmPC guideline which states the following: 
"…Such  information  on  clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should 
summarise  evidence  from  relevant  studies  supporting  the  indication."  Furthermore,  the  proposed 
statement may encourage prescribers to off-label prescriptions of Exforge. 
Further,  the  submitted  studies  were  not  conducted  in  an  appropriate  way  to  support  the  proposed 
statement. Deficiencies relate to inclusion criteria, conduct of the study and handling of data.  
The proposed statement:  
"In  two  additional  active-controlled  trials  of  1612  patients,  additional  blood  pressure  lowering  effects 
for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy 
including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and 
diuretics" 
is therefore not acceptable. 
Diabetic patients: 
The Applicant has presented subgroup analyses from the 9 studies submitted to support the efficacy of 
valsartan/amlodipine in hypertensive patients regardless of diabetes status.   
Patients  with  type  1  diabetes  as  well  as  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and  poor  glucose  control  were 
excluded from these studies.  
As mentioned by the applicant the definition of diabetes was not universal across the studies: 
"The  definition  of  diabetes  varied  across  studies.    In  [Study  A2401],  [Study  A2402],  [Study  A2403] 
and [Study A2404], diabetes status came from a specific question on the Medical History case report 
form.    In  [Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  and  [Study  A2306]  diabetes  status  was 
determined  according  to  concomitant  medication  use  at  baseline  and  medical  history,  using  WHODRL 
and MedDRA terms in place at the time of the original Exforge submission.  In [Study US02], subgroup 
analyses based on diabetes status at baseline defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dL vs 
FPG  ≤  126  mg/dL  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  variables.    For  the  purpose  of  the 
diabetes  analyses  performed  for  this  Clinical  Overview  Addendum,  patient  diabetic  status  was 
determined  post-hoc  according  to  concomitant  medication  use  at  baseline  and  medical  history,  using 
WHODRL and MedDRA terms at the time of CSR completion." 
Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made by WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria for fasting glucose levels 
(plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L (126mg/dL) or plasma glucose levels 2-hours after 75 mg oral glucose 
load of ≥11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL), or newly diagnosed with mixed meal tolerance test or oral glucose 
tolerance screening or casual glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL) with symptoms.  
As a consequence, diabetic status in the studies referred to is therefore not necessarily confirmed.  
41
 
As mentioned previously, studies 2401, US02, 2402 and 2403 were not conducted in accordance with 
the  authorised  indication.  It  is  therefore  not  considered  justified  to  claim  any  inclusions  in  the  SmPC 
based  on  post  hoc  subgroup  analyses  concerning  diabetic  status  based  on  the  results  from  these 
studies.  Notwithstanding  this  fact,  the  reductions  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  in  studies  2401  and  US02 
seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.  
In study 2402 the week 8 analyses for the val/aml combination is of limited value, as patients could be 
uptitrated from 160/10 mg to 320/10 mg at week 4. 
Also  in  study  2404  the  presented  analyses  were  not  pre-specified.  Also  in  this  study  the  reduction  in 
MSSBP and MSDBP seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients. 
In  the  previously  submitted  studies  2201,  2307,  2305  and  2306  the  subgroup  analyses  by  diabetic 
status are based on very small numbers of patients by treatment group (n=8-18)  which do not allow 
for strong conclusions. 
In summary, the presented post-hoc analyses do not justify the inclusion of a statement regarding the 
efficacy  of  Exforge  by  diabetic  status  for  the  following  reasons:  1)  Different  definitions  were  used  to 
determine diabetic status; 2) The post-hoc analyses were either based on very small patient numbers 
(studies  2201,  2307,  2305,  2306),  or  were  based  on  studies  not  conducted  in  accordance  with  the 
authorised indication; 3) The efficacy of Exforge does not seem as good in diabetic patients as in non-
diabetic subjects. 
These  analyses  do  therefore  not  justify  the  inclusion  of  the  proposed  statement  in  section  5.1 
regarding the efficacy of Exforge by diabetic status. 
BMI: 
The MAH has presented subgroup analyses for obese patients with BMI >30 and patients with BMI < 
30.  Focussing  on  the  studies  that  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  authorised  indication  the 
proportion  of  obese  patients  with  BMI  >  30  was  in  the  range  of  30  -50%.  Although  no  statistical 
analyses  were  presented,  the  anti-hypertensive  effect  of  Exforge  seemed  similar  in  obese-  and  non-
obese subjects. The presented information on reduction in MSSBP and MSDBP are considered sufficient 
to allow a statement on response to Exforge by BMI to be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC with the 
following modification:  
"Age,  gender,  race,  or  body  mass  index  (  ≥30kg/m2,  <30kg/m2) or  diabetes  status  did  not  influence 
the response to Exforge. 
2.2.2.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  valsartan/amlodipine  was  thoroughly  evaluated  during  the  assessment  of  the  initial 
marketing authorisation application and re-assessed in each of the PSURs submitted since approval of 
val/aml  fixed  dose  combination  in  the  EU.    The  double-blind,  active-  or  placebo-controlled  safety 
population  in  the  original  submission  [Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  [Study  A2306], 
and  [Study  A2308]  included  5175  patients,  2613  of  whom  received  valsartan/amlodipine  treatment. 
The studies completed since the granting of the marketing authorisation included 4014 patients, 2815 
of  whom  received  valsartan/amlodipine  treatment.  These  studies  had  a  double-blind  treatment 
duration ranging from 8-16 weeks. 
The  focus  of  the  safety  data  presented  in  the  current  dossier  is  the  additional  safety  information 
provided  for  the  use  of  valsartan/amlodipine  in  diabetics  and  obese  patients  (BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2);  this 
includes safety data from 10 studies (2 placebo-controlled and 3 reference therapy-controlled studies 
42
 
from the original MAA, and the 5 reference therapy-controlled studies completed since the approval of 
the MAA). The data presented below represent the safety population. 
Subgroup assessment of AEs according to diabetic status (yes/no) 
The definition of diabetes varied across studies (please refer to the efficacy section above for variation 
3).  The proportion of patients with diabetes in the 5 studies completed since the approval of the MAA 
and the controlled trials dataset from the original dossier ranged from 7.9-17.2%. 
AEs by diabetic status in patients with stage 2 hypertension and in Black patients 
Study A2402, Black patients: 
This  study  included  88  diabetics  (15.4%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving  val/aml 
was  similar  in  diabetic  (44.7%)  and  non-diabetic  (44.4%)  patients.  The  most  common  AEs  in  the 
valsartan/amlodipine  diabetic  group  were  bronchitis,  fatigue  and  headache,  each  reported  for  2 
patients  (4.3%).  The  only  AE  reported  more  frequently  in  diabetic  patients  in  both  the 
valsartan/amlodipine and amlodipine group was muscle spasms (2.1% and 4.9%, respectively). 
Study A2403, stage II hypertension: 
This  study  included  71  diabetics  (11.0%).  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving 
valsartan/amlodipine was similar in diabetic (34.3%) and non-diabetic (35.3%) patients with the most 
common AEs in the valsartan/amlodipine diabetic group being peripheral oedema (n=5 (14.3%)) and 
pain in extremity (n=2 (5.7%)). 
Study A2404, Patients inadequately controlled on Amlodipine 5 mg alone: 
This  study  included  204  diabetics  (17.2%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving 
valsartan/amlodipine was similar in diabetic (41.5%) and non-diabetic (44.4%) patients with the most 
common  AEs  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  diabetic  group  being  peripheral  oedema  (n=5  (4.7%))  and 
rhinitis (n= 4 (3.8%)). 
AEs by diabetic status in non-responder trials 
Study A2401, Patients inadequately controlled on monotherapy: 
This  study  included  146  diabetics  (16.3%).  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  total  population  of 
patients  receiving  valsartan/amlodipine  was  slightly  higher  in  diabetics  (53.4%)  vs.  non-diabetics 
(48.5%). The most frequently reported AEs in the overall valsartan/amlodipine diabetic subgroup were 
peripheral  oedema  (n=24  (16.4%)),  back  pain  (n=6  (4.1%),  hypotension  (n=4  (2.7%)),  and  muscle 
spasms (n= 4 (2.7%). 
Study US02, Patients inadequeately controlled on ARB monotherapy: 
This  study  included  125  diabetics  (17.2%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving 
valsartan/amlodipine  was  similar  in  diabetic  (38.4%)  and  non-diabetic  (36.7%)  patients.    The  most 
frequently reported AEs in the overall valsartan/amlodipine diabetic subgroup were peripheral oedema 
(n=8 (6.4%)) and dizziness (n=4 (3.2%)) 
AEs by diabetic status in reference- and placebo-controlled trials in the original submission 
In the original submission diabetic status was available for 5175 patients in the total safety population 
of  the  pooled  studies  ([Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  [Study A2306],  and  [Study 
A2308]). The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving valsartan/amlodipine was slightly higher in 
diabetic (47.1%) vs. non-diabetic (41.7%) patients. Peripheral oedema (5.3%) and headache (5.3%) 
were  the  most  common  AEs  in  the  valsartan/amlodipine  diabetic  subgroup,  both  frequencies  being 
lower than in the valsartan/amlodipine non-diabetic subgroup.

Subgroup assessment of adverse events according to BMI (≥ 30 and < 30 kg/m2)  
AEs by BMI category in patients with stage 2 hypertension and in Black patients 
Study A2402, Black patients:  
This study included 333 obese patients (58.6%). The overall incidence of AEs in patients receiving both 
valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  was  slightly  greater  in  obese  compared  to  non-obese  patients 
(47.6% vs. 40.2% and 46.1% vs. 44.9%, respectively). The most common AE in obese and non-obese 
patients  was  peripheral  oedema  (14.9%  vs.  9.4%  (valsartan/amlodipine)  and  10.9%  vs.  7.6% 
(amlodipine). 
Study A2403, stage II hypertension:  
This  study  included  280  obese  patients  (43.5%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving 
both  valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  was  slightly  greater  in  obese  patients  compared  to  non-
obese patients (41.0% vs. 31.0% and 39.0% vs. 35.0%, respectively). The most common AE in obese 
and non-obese patients was peripheral oedema (14.9% vs. 11.2% (valsartan/amlodipine) and 16.4% 
vs.18.2% (amlodipine).  
Study A2404, Patients inadequately controlled on Amlodipine 5 mg alone:  
This  study  included  425  obese  patients  (36.3%).    The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  patients  receiving 
both  valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine  was  49.3%  vs.  40.9%  and  65.3%  vs.  50.6%  in  obese  vs. 
non-obese,  respectively.  The  most  common  AE  in  obese  and  non-obese  patients  was  peripheral 
oedema (7.9% vs. 7.0% (valsartan/amlodipine) and 38.8% vs. 27.5% (amlodipine). 
AEs by BMI in non-responder trials 
Study A2401, Patients inadequately controlled on monotherapy:  
This study included 352 (39.7%) obese patients. The overall incidence of AEs in the total population of 
patients  receiving  valsartan/amlodipine  was  53.7%  vs.  46.4%  in  obese  vs.  non-obese  patients.  In 
obese  and  non-obese  patients,  the  most  common  AE  in  the  overall  valsartan/amlodipine  group  was 
peripheral oedema (18.5% vs. 15.5%).  
Study US02, Patients inadequately controlled on ARB monotherapy: 
This  study  included  404  obese  patients  (55.6%)  included  404  obese  patients  (55.6%).    The  overall 
incidence of AEs in the total valsartan/amlodipine population was slightly higher in obese (39.1%) vs. 
non-obese (34.1%) patients.  In obese and non-obese patients, the most common AE was peripheral 
oedema 7.2% vs. 5.9%).

In the total safety population of the pooled studies in the original submission ([Study A2201], [Study 
A2307], [Study A2305], [Study A2306], and [Study A2308]) 2187 patients (42.5%) were obese (BMI 
data  was  available  for  5149  patients).    42.8%  were  obese  among  patients  treated  with 
valsartan/amlodipine  and  amlodipine.  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  slightly  greater  in  obese 
compared  to  non-obese  patients  in  all  treatment  groups,  including  placebo.  In  both  obese  and  non-
obese patients, peripheral oedema and headache were the most common AEs overall. The incidence of 
peripheral  oedema  was  less  in  both  obese  and  non-obese  patients  receiving  valsartan/amlodipine 
regimens compared to amlodipine.

Deaths and other serious or clinically significant adverse events  
No deaths occurred in any of the studies completed since the original submission. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety  
The  safety  data  presented  in  the  submitted  dossier  provides  supportive  safety  data  from  five  new 
valsartan/amlodipine  randomized,  controlled  studies.  No  new  or  altered  safety  signals  have  emerged 
from the new trials. Safety data have also been provided for sub-groups with and with-out diabetes as 
well  as  obese  and  non-obese  patients  (≥  30  and  <  30  kg/m2).  Though  obese  patients  had  higher 
frequencies of overall AEs than non-obese no clinically relevant differences were observed in the safety 
profile  of  valsartan/amlodipine  in  diabetics  and  obese  patients  when  compared  to  the  patient 
populations with-out these clinical entities. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion 
Variation 1:   
The scope of this variation was the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on efficacy in 
patients with stage 2 hypertension and in black patients based on studies VAA 2402 and VAA 2403. 
Studies  2402  and  2403  were  submitted  to  support  efficacy  in  patients  with  grade  2  systolic 
hypertension  and  study  2402  was  conducted  in  Black  patients.    Several  deficiencies  relating  to  the 
study  designs  for  both  studies  have  been  identified.  In  both  studies  valsartan/amlodipine  160/10  mg 
seems more effective than amlodipine 10 mg in the treatment of systolic hypertension >160mmHg and 
<200mmHg  in  a  population  that  was  either  treatment  naïve  or  was  treated  with  non-specified 
antihypertensives.  This  means  that  in  neither  study  2402  nor  in  study  2403  patients  were  treated  in 
accordance with the authorised indication, as Exforge is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is 
not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  or  valsartan  monotherapy.  The  SmPC  is  a  document  that 
provides  information  on  a  particular  medicinal  product  and  is  not  issued  as  a  general  treatment 
recommendation.  The  SmPC  guideline  states  in  section  5.1  clinical  efficacy  and  safety:  “It  may  be 
appropriate  to  provide  limited  information,  relevant  to  the  prescriber,  such  as  the  main  results 
(statistically compelling and clinically relevant) regarding pre-specified end points or clinical outcomes 
in the major trials…… supporting the indication.”  
Furthermore, final judgement on efficacy cannot be made as the relevant analyses were made after 2 
weeks  of  treatment  which  is  considered  too  short.  According  to  the  guideline  on  the  clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  treatment  of  hypertension  (CHMP/EWP/238/95  Rev.2  and 
EMA//238/1995/rev.3) a tested dose should remain stable for at least 4 weeks.  
In  summary,  the  provided  studies  are  not  considered  sufficiently  robust  and  are  not  in  line  with  the 
authorised indication. As a consequence, the wording that was proposed by the MAH: 
"In two additional active-controlled studies of 1,612 patients, additional blood pressure lowering effects 
for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy 
including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and 
diuretics. 
Active controlled trials in stage 2 hypertensive patients 
Two active-controlled studies of 1,195 patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg 
and  <200 mmHg  were  conducted.  In  the  first  study  in  639  patients  (baseline  blood  pressure 
171/95 mmHg),  an  Exforge  regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg 
significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  30/13 mmHg  compared  to  24/9 mmHg 
with a similar regimen of amlodipine 5 mg force-titrated to 10 mg. The second active-controlled study, 
45
 
specifically  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  Exforge  in  556  black  patients,  compared  an  Exforge 
regimen  of  5 mg/160 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg/160 mg  for  2  weeks  with  a  similar  regimen  of 
amlodipine  5 mg  force-titrated  to  10 mg.  In  this  study  (baseline  blood  pressure  171/98 mmHg), 
Exforge  significantly  reduced  sitting  blood  pressure  after  4 weeks  by  31/13 mmHg  compared  to 
27/11 mmHg with amlodipine." 
can therefore not be accepted.  
In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed not to pursue the proposed wording. 
Variation 2 
The scope of this variation was the update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on the efficacy 
and  safety  of  valsartan/amlodipine  160/5  mg  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg  based  on  study  VAA 
2404.  
The  proposed  wording  in  section  5.1  focuses  on  the  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  compared  to 
amlodipine  alone  in  the  context  of  oedema  incidence  rather  than  on  the  oedema  incidence  itself  as 
described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. According to the MAH, this information provided in section 5.1 is 
relevant  for  prescribers  as  it  presents  efficacy  of  valsartan/amlodipine  in  the  approved  doses  of  5 
mg/80  mg  and  5  mg/160  mg  as  a  benefit  in  relation  to  oedema  incidence  versus  amlodipine  in 
monotherapy. Thus, the proposed SmPC wording provides additional reassurance to the prescriber on 
efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine fixed combination in relation to oedema reduction. 
Oedema  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  amlodipine  monotherapy  group.  In  this  respect,  it 
should also be kept in mind that only patients 55 years or older were included in the study. Oedema is 
dose-dependent  with  amlodipine  therapy  and  the  clearance  of  amlodipine  is  reduced  in  the  elderly, 
resulting in a higher exposure. It is therefore likely that the incidence of amlodipine in this study may 
be exaggerated due to the chosen study population. 
The  MAH  acknowledged  that  patients  aged  55  years  and  over  were  selected  in  Study  A2404  to 
demonstrate the effect of valsartan/amlodipine compared to amlodipine monotherapy on the reduction 
of  oedema  incidence.  According  to  the  MAH,  as  recognised  by  guidelines  for  the  management  of 
arterial hypertension, the patient population selected in Study A2404 (≥ 55 years old) is representative 
of the hypertensive population at risk. Age (men >55 years; women >65 years) is considered a factor 
influencing  prognosis  of  cardiovascular  risk  and  should  be  used  to  stratify  the  risk  of  cardiovascular 
disease.  Older  patients  may  be  more  prone  to  develop  peripheral  oedema  on  non-dihydropyridine 
calcium  channel  blockers  due  to  the  effects  of  aging  on  the  peripheral  vasculature.  Therefore, 
according  to  the  MAH,  this  is  the  population  that  may  have  the  greatest  benefit  with  respect  to 
attenuation in the development of oedema but does not preclude a benefit in younger patients.  
Albeit statistically significant, the differences in BP reductions between valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg 
and  amlodipine  10  mg  are  not  exceptionally  different  and  there  is  no  obvious  reason  to  insert  a 
statement  on  ”numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine  10  mg”, 
derived  from  a  not  completely  recognized  subgroup  of  patients  with  hypertension  (those  >55  years), 
into section 5.1 of the SmPC. In spite of the fact that the age of >55 years is an agreed risk factor for 
males for CV disease (65 years for females), it is not recognized as a subgroup for hypertension trials.  
The SmPC guideline states on section 5.1:  
”…It  may  be  appropriate  to  provide  limited  information,  relevant  to  the  prescriber,  such  as  the  main 
results  (statistically  compelling  and  clinically  relevant)  regarding  pre-specified  end  points  or  clinical 
outcomes  in  the  major  trials,  and  giving  the  main  characteristics  of  the  patient  population.  Such 
information  on  clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should  summarise 
evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication. The magnitude of effects should be described 
46
 
using  absolute  figures.  (Relative  risks  or  odd  ratio  should  not  be  presented  without  absolute 
figures)….” 
Consequently,  as  mentioned  above  with  reference  to  the  SmPC  guideline,  the  efficacy  part  of  the 
proposed wording is not considered appropriate. Therefore, the proposed wording (highlighted):  
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5 mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema and amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/160 mg  produced  numerically  greater  reductions  in  blood  pressure  compared  to  amlodipine 
10 mg  with  a  4-fold  lower  incidence  of  peripheral  oedema.  In  patients  adequately  controlled  on 
amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan  5 mg/80 mg  may 
achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.” 
is not acceptable to the CHMP and thus the context of the proposed safety information on oedema is 
not relevant. The existing information on oedema in section 4.8 of the SmPC is regarded sufficient for 
prescribers. 
Furthermore,  during  the  procedure  the  CHMP  questioned  the  validity  of  the  already  existing  SmPC 
wording in section 5.1: 
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.”  
Upon request by the CHMP, the MAH clarified that this wording was based on data collected from the 
two multi-factorial studies [Study A2201] and [Study A2307] submitted as part of the original MAA for 
the fixed dose combination valsartan/amlodipine. 
Following  the  assessment  of  all  data  provided,  the  CHMP  did  not  consider  it  appropriate  to  compare 
two  different  studies  in  order  to  obtain  a  statement  on  BP  results  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC.  The 
studies  are  not  considered  completely  comparable  with  respect  to  the  included  patient  population 
which is demonstrated by the differences in age categories (28.6% patients >65 years in study A2307 
compared  to  18.2%  in  study  A2201)  and  ethnic  origin  (10.4%  of  Black  patients  in  study  A2201  as 
compared  to  0.4%  in  study  A2307.  Study  A2307  had  in  contrast  a  higher  percentage  of  oriental 
patients, 13.7%, as compared to study A2201 (1.6%)). 
Following  the  CHMP  assessment  of  these  data,  the  MAH  acknowledged  the  CHMP  comments  and 
revised  the  current  product  information  wording  to  more  accurately  reflect  the  data  generated  in  the 
multi-factorial  Study  A2201  and  Study  A2307.  However,  according  to  the  MAH,  the  percentage  of 
patients  in  active  treatment  groups  achieving  BP  control  (msDBP  <90  mmHg)  could  be  considered 
similar  for  valsartan/amlodipine  80/5  mg  (39.1%)  [Study  2201]  and  amlodipine  10  mg  (37.5  %) 
[Study  2307]  after  adjusting  for  placebo  control  rates.  The  CHMP,  however,  considered  the  placebo 
control  rates  very  different:  33.9%  (studyA2201)  and  42.6%  (study  2307)  and  furthermore,  the 
MSDPB and msSPB reductions for amlodipine 10 mg do not seem comparable to valsartan/amlodipine 
80/5  mg  but  seem  to  lie  in  between  the  results  for  amlodipine  5  mg  and  valsartan/amlodipine  80/5 
mg. These facts indicate that it is not appropriate to compare the two studies with regard to BP results.  
Consequently,  the  amendment  to  the  existing  wording  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  response  to  the 
CHMP  Request  for  supplementary  information,  to  more  accurately  reflect  the  data  generated  in  the 
multi-factorial Study A2201 and Study A2307, and the mentioning of the age range to avoid ambiguity 
regarding the population studied in Study A2404 was rejected by the Committee: 
47
 
 
“5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
(...) 
Amlodipine/Valsartan 
(...) 
 In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg  Patients  receiving  amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/80 mg  may  achieve  blood  pressure  control  similar  to  amlodipine  10 mg  with  less  oedema.  In 
patients  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema, 
amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema. 
In  an  additional  active-controlled  study  of  1183  patients  aged  55  years  or  older  not  adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  5mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/160  mg  produced  numerically  greater 
reductions in blood pressure compared to amlodipine 10 mg with a 4-fold lower incidence of peripheral 
oedema.” 
Moreover, the CHMP was of the view that the existing paragraph, although previously accepted by the 
Committee by mistake, should be removed from the SmPC since it was considered that the text might 
be misleading for prescribers: 
“In  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  5  mg,  amlodipine/valsartan  5  mg/80  mg  may 
achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema. In patients adequately 
controlled  on  amlodipine  10 mg  but  who  experience  unacceptable  oedema,  amlodipine/valsartan 
5 mg/80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.”  
In conclusion, the wording suggested by the MAH as part of variation 2 is not acceptable to the CHMP. 
In addition, the already approved paragraph should for the reasons outlined above be deleted from the 
SmPC. As part of variation 2, the MAH also took the opportunity to update the SmPC in line with the 
latest QRD template, including a revision of the presentation of the ADRs in section 4.8, and to update 
the contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet, which is acceptable. 
In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed not to pursue the proposed wording. 
Variation 3 
This variation had several scopes:  
The update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on efficacy in patients  
 
 
not adequately responding to any monotherapy and in  
obese and diabetic patients  
based on studies VAA 2401, VAA 2402,VAA 2403, VAA 2404 and VAA US02 (as well as original dossier 
studies VAA 2201, VAA 2305, VAA 2306, VAA 2307 and VAA 2308).  
Regarding the first part of the variation:   
Both  studies  (2401  and  US02)  that  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  proposed  change  in  5.1 
concerning  the  efficacy  in  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  any  monotherapy  including  ACE 
inhibitors,  ARBs,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and  diuretics  were  not  conducted  in 
accordance  with  the  authorised  indication,  i.e.  in  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  amlodipine  or 
valsartan  monotherapy.  This  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  SPC  guideline  which  states  the  following 
"…Such  information  on  clinical  trials  should  be  concise,  clear,  relevant  and  balanced,  and  should 
summarise  evidence  from  relevant  studies  supporting  the  indication."  Furthermore,  the  proposed 
statement may encourage prescribers to off-label prescriptions of Exforge. 
48
 
Further,  the  submitted  studies  were  not  conducted  in  an  appropriate  way  to  support  the  proposed 
statement. Deficiencies relate to inclusion criteria, conduct of the study and handling of data.  
The proposed statement:  
"In  two  additional  active-controlled  trials  of  1612  patients,  additional  blood  pressure  lowering  effects 
for Exforge were observed compared to baseline in patients not adequately responding to monotherapy 
including  ACE  inhibitors,  angiotensin  receptor  blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  beta-blockers  and 
diuretics" 
is therefore not acceptable. 
In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH decided to accept the comments regarding 
“efficacy  in  patients  not  adequately  responding  to  any  monotherapy”  and  agreed  not  to  pursue  the 
proposed wording as part of variation 3. 
Regarding the second part of the variation: 
Diabetic patients: 
The Applicant has presented subgroup analyses from the 9 studies submitted to support the efficacy of 
valsartan/amlodipine in hypertensive patients regardless of diabetes status.   
Patients  with  type  1  diabetes  as  well  as  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and  poor  glucose  control  were 
excluded from these studies.  
As mentioned by the applicant the definition of diabetes was not universal across the studies: 
"The  definition  of  diabetes  varied  across  studies.    In  [Study  A2401],  [Study  A2402],  [Study  A2403] 
and [Study A2404], diabetes status came from a specific question on the Medical History case report 
form.    In  [Study  A2201],  [Study  A2307],  [Study  A2305],  and  [Study  A2306]  diabetes  status  was 
determined  according  to  concomitant  medication  use  at  baseline  and  medical  history,  using  WHODRL 
and MedDRA terms in place at the time of the original Exforge submission.  In [Study US02], subgroup 
analyses based on diabetes status at baseline defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 126 mg/dL vs 
FPG  ≤  126  mg/dL  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  variables.    For  the  purpose  of  the 
diabetes  analyses  performed  for  this  Clinical  Overview  Addendum,  patient  diabetic  status  was 
determined  post-hoc  according  to  concomitant  medication  use  at  baseline  and  medical  history,  using 
WHODRL and MedDRA terms at the time of CSR completion." 
Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made by WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria for fasting glucose levels 
(plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L (126mg/dL) or plasma glucose levels 2-hours after 75 mg oral glucose 
load of ≥11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL), or newly diagnosed with mixed meal tolerance test or oral glucose 
tolerance screening or casual glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (200mg/dL) with symptoms.  
As a consequence, diabetic status in the studies referred to is therefore not necessarily confirmed.  
As mentioned previously, studies 2401, US02, 2402 and 2403 were not conducted in accordance with 
the  authorised  indication.  It  is  therefore  not  considered  justified  to  claim  any  inclusions  in  the  SmPC 
based  on  post  hoc  subgroup  analyses  concerning  diabetic  status  based  on  the  results  from  these 
studies.  Notwithstanding  this  fact,  the  reductions  in  MSSBP  and  MSDBP  in  studies  2401  and  US02 
seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.  
In study 2402 the week 8 analyses for the val/aml combination is of limited value, as patients could be 
uptitrated from 160/10 mg to 320/10 mg at week 4. 
Also  in  study  2404  the  presented  analyses  were  not  pre-specified.  Also  in  this  study  the  reduction  in 
MSSBP and MSDBP seemed numerically lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients. 
49
 
In  the  previously  submitted  studies  2201,  2307,  2305  and  2306  the  subgroup  analyses  by  diabetic 
status are based on very small numbers of patients by treatment group (n=8-18)  which do not allow 
for strong conclusions. 
In summary, the presented post-hoc analyses do not justify the inclusion of a statement regarding the 
efficacy  of  Exforge  by  diabetic  status  for  the  following  reasons:  1)  Different  definitions  were  used  to 
determine diabetic status; 2) The post-hoc analyses were either based on very small patient numbers 
(studies  2201,  2307,  2305,  2306),  or  were  based  on  studies  not  conducted  in  accordance  with  the 
authorised indication; 3) The efficacy of Exforge does not seem as good in diabetic patients as in non-
diabetic subjects. 
These  analyses  do  therefore  not  justify  the  inclusion  of  the  proposed  statement  in  section  5.1 
regarding the efficacy of Exforge by diabetic status. 
In view of the outcome of the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed not to pursue the proposed wording 
in diabetic patients. 
BMI: 
The MAH has presented subgroup analyses for obese patients with BMI >30 and patients with BMI < 
30.  Focussing  on  the  studies  that  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  authorised  indication  the 
proportion  of  obese  patients  with  BMI  >  30  was  in  the  range  of  30  -50%.  Although  no  statistical 
analyses  were  presented,  the  anti-hypertensive  effect  of  Exforge  seemed  similar  in  obese-  and  non-
obese subjects. The presented information on reduction in MSSBP and MSDBP are considered sufficient 
to allow a statement on response to Exforge by BMI to be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC with the 
following modification:  
"Age,  gender,  race,  or  body  mass  index  (  ≥30kg/m2,  <30kg/m2) or  diabetes  status  did  not  influence 
the response to Exforge. 
Following the CHMP assessment, the MAH agreed to revise the proposed wording as requested by the 
CHMP.  
3.  Conclusion

 
The studies submitted by the MAH in support of the variation are not sufficiently robust; 
The studies submitted by the MAH in support of the variation are not in line with the authorised

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically and with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of inflammatory 
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), plaque psoriasis (Ps), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). 
Problem statement 
Spondyloarthritidis is a group of diseases that share common clinical, radiographic, and genetic 
features. This includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis, 
enteropathic or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related arthritis and undifferentiated 
spondyloarthritis (SpA). Because there is an overlap of features among these diseases, there is some 
variability in the way physicians may interpret and apply these diagnoses in clinical practice. An 
alternative way of categorizing SpA patients would be to define them by their primary clinical 
manifestation – axial or peripheral SpA. The Assessments in Spondyloarthritis International Society 
(ASAS) Working Group has proposed and validated new classification criteria for patients with axial 
SpA and for those with peripheral SpA.1,2 This new set of criteria incorporates the use of magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) for visualizing sacroiliitis in addition to traditional x-rays.

There is a medical need in patients with axial SpA who have disease features similar to patients with 
AS, but who do not fulfill the modified New York criteria for AS by virtue of not having evidence of 
structural damage in the form of radiographic sacroiliitis. Patients with non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-
axSpA) can present with disease features and a level of disease activity similar to those observed in 
patients with AS.  
While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in treating the signs and symptoms 
of axial SpA in some patients, traditional anti rheumatic therapies such as methotrexate or 
sulfasalazine are not effective for the axial component of SpA and the use of systemic corticosteroids is 
not supported by evidence. When NSAIDs fail to provide adequate control of the disease, patients with 
non-radiographic axial SpA do not have alternative treatments available. However, such patients may 
continue to experience signs and symptoms similar to AS patients but without alternative treatment. 
Scope of the variation  
In this submission the MAH applied for a new therapeutic indication for the treatment of adults with 
severe axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response 
to conventional therapy or are intolerant to NSAIDs. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated accordingly as well as Annex II and IIIB. Some editorial changes have also been made 
throughout the SmPC.  
The initially applied wording for the extension of indication reads as follows (additions and deletion to 
the existing approved AS indication): 
Axial spondyloarthritis including Ankylosing spondylitis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis, including active 
ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy or are intolerant 
to NSAIDs. 
The following variation application is made in this submission:

Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/141/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/141/2011 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Development programme  
A clinical program was developed by the MAH to study the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in 
patients with axial SpA who do not fulfil the modified New York criteria for AS. This development 
program consists in a currently ongoing, single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (Study M10-791) aiming 
to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 40 mg given subcutaneously (SC) every other 
Assessment report

week (eow) versus placebo in adult subjects with axial SpA diagnosed according to the published 
criteria of the ASAS working group. 
The pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design of study M10-791 was chosen to 
demonstrate the efficacy of adalimumab in subjects with active axial SpA not fulfilling the modified 
New York criteria for AS who had an inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or more NSAIDs, or had a 
contraindication for NSAIDs. Study M10-791 includes a 12-week, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled 
period and a 92-week open-label (OL) treatment period.  
The 40 mg adalimumab dose was chosen in accordance with the AS and PsA dosage recommendations 
in the EU SmPC. Moreover, the adalimumab clinical trial safety database across multiple disease 
indications is also largely comprised of data recorded with the 40 mg eow dose, which is also the 
approved maintenance dose for adult patients across all other indications. 
Compliance with scientific advice  
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. 
Compliance with CHMP guideline  
There is no specific guideline for the development of medicinal products for the treatment of non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Reference was made to the CHMP 2009 Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation for Medicinal Products for the treatment of AS (CPMP/EWP/4891/03). 
Although ASAS20 is commonly used in placebo-controlled trials in AS for some products (e.g. NSAIDs), 
ASAS40 was chosen as the primary endpoint also considering that a more stringent efficacy 
improvement may be required in certain circumstances, particularly in the case of products belonging 
to therapeutic classes different from NSAIDs. 
Overall the study M10-791 was in line with the EMA guideline (CPMP/EWP/4891/03) and in particular 
with respect to study design, main efficacy endpoint and secondary endpoints. 
General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
The clinical trial submitted in support of this variation was performed in accordance with GCP as 
claimed by the applicant. The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted 
outside the Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 
2001/20/EC. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) data were not collected in Study M10-791 as the PK of adalimumab have been 
previously established (as described in section 5.2 of the approved SmPC).  
Since non-radiographic axial SpA, AS, and PsA all belong to the spondyloarthritides group of diseases, 
the 40 mg adalimumab dose was chosen in accordance with the approved AS and PsA dosage 
recommendations in the EU SmPC. No new clinical pharmacology data are being submitted as part of 
this application. 
The approach taken in order to select the dose is considered appropriate by the CHMP.

1.2.2.  Clinical efficacy 
1.2.2.1. Main pivotal study 
Study M10-791 
Study M10-791 is a multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the human anti-TNF 
monoclonal antibody adalimumab in subjects with axial spondyloarthritis. 
Methods 
Study M10-791 includes a 12-week double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled phase followed by a 92-week 
open-label (OL) phase. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either adalimumab 40 mg SC eow or matching 
placebo for 12 weeks during the DB period. Following the DB period, at Week 12 all subjects entered 
the OL arm of the study in which they received adalimumab 40 mg SC eow for up to an additional 
92 weeks (all subjects on placebo were started on adalimumab and subjects already on adalimumab 
continued during the 92 weeks of the OL period). 
Figure 2 Study design schematic 
Subjects were to visit the study site at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 during the DB period, and at Weeks 16, 
20, 24, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 68, 80, 92, and 104 during the OL period. If, during the course of study 
drug administration, the subject prematurely discontinued study drug use, the procedures outlined for 
the termination visit were to be completed within 2 weeks of the last dose of study drug, and 
preferably prior to the initiation of another therapy. 
MRI of the spine and sacroiliac (SI) joints was performed at screening and on Weeks 12, 52 and 104.

azathioprine) within 28 days prior to the Baseline visit was prohibited. 
Opioid analgesics (other than tramadol) within 14 days prior to Baseline visit were prohibited. 
Only one intra-articular corticosteroid injection for a peripheral joint was to be allowed during the first 
24 weeks of the study. After Week 24, intra-articular corticosteroid injections were to be allowed at the 
investigator's discretion. Once a joint was injected it was to be considered not evaluable/assessable 
during the 28 days following injection. No spinal, para-spinal, or sacroiliac joint injections were to be 
allowed during the first 24 weeks of the study. 
Treatments 
Study drug was to be provided as a sterile SC injection solution in 1-ml pre-filled syringes containing 
either adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 mL or matching placebo for adalimumab. Study drug was to be self-
administered SC eow at approximately the same time of day. The day of the first dose of study drug 
was designated as Day 1. 
Objectives 
The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 40 mg given eow 
subcutaneously compared to placebo for 12 weeks followed by OL safety and efficacy assessments in 
subjects with active axial SpA not fulfilling the modified New York criteria for AS who had an 
inadequate response to, or intolerance to 1 or more NSAIDs, or had a contraindication for NSAIDs. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable for this study was the proportion of subjects who achieved ASAS40 
response at the Week 12 visit. A subject was to be categorized as an ASAS40 responder at the Week 
12 visit if the subject achieved: 
Improvement of ≥40% and absolute improvement of ≥20 units (on a scale of 0 to 100) from Baseline 
in ≥3 of the following 4 domains with no deterioration at all in the potential remaining domain: 
 
Patient's Global Assessment – Represented by the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease 
Activity VAS score (0 to 100 scale)

Pain – Represented by the total back pain VAS score (0 to 100 scale) 
Function – Represented by the BASFI score (10 VAS scales on functional items, like putting on 
socks, bending for a pen, doing a full day’s activities (0 to 100 scale). Mean of the ten scores is 
calculated.)

Sample size 
The study was powered to detect differences in ASAS40 response rates at Week 12 in SpA subjects 
with axial disease. Assuming an expected ASAS40 response rate of 15% in the placebo group and 35% 
in the adalimumab group, a total sample size of 194 subjects (that is, 97 placebo and 97 adalimumab 
subjects) will provide approximately 90% statistical power to detect the difference between the two 
treatment groups. This sample size calculation assumed a 1:1 randomization ratio, and was based on a 
2-sided chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either adalimumab or matching placebo for 12 
weeks. At the Week 12 visit all subjects were then to receive OL adalimumab to be administered 
through Week 104. 
Blinding 
The MAH, the investigator, study site personnel, and the subject were to remain blinded to each 
subject's treatment throughout the 12-week blinded period of the study. An Interactive voice response 
system was to provide access to blinded subject treatment information in the case of medical 
emergency. Subjects could be unblinded after the database lock on the blinded portion of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses of the endpoints described above were conducted on the following analysis sets: 
 
Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) 
The ITT population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of blinded 
study drug. However, as a result of investigator noncompliance, the MAH determined that 7 
Assessment report  
Page 9/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects enrolled at a specific site should be excluded from the efficacy analyses. Therefore, no 
analyses were conducted using the ITT population except as a sensitivity analysis for the primary 
endpoint and ranked secondary endpoints.  
●  Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
All efficacy analyses were conducted on the FAS, which is a subset of the ITT population that 
excludes the 7 subjects. Efficacy analyses on the FAS were conducted according to subjects' 
assigned treatment groups. 
●  Per Protocol Population (PPP) 
In order to evaluate the impact of major protocol violations on the results of the trial, additional 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable was conducted on the PPP, which consists of all FAS 
subjects who completed the DB portion of the study and did not meet any major protocol 
violation during the DB portion. The exclusion of subjects was determined via classification prior 
to interim database lock for data pertaining to the DB period. 
●  Open-Label (OL) population 
The OL population was comprised of all randomized subjects who completed Week 12 and had at 
least 1 dose of OL study drug. This population is a subset of the FAS. No PPP is defined for the OL 
population. 
●  Any Adalimumab Set 
The Any Adalimumab set includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
adalimumab any time during the study, with the exception of the 7 subjects. This population is a 
subset of the FAS and was analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of adalimumab over time. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders according to ASAS40 response criteria 
at Week 12, and the response rate observed in the group randomized to adalimumab 40 mg eow was 
to be compared to that in the placebo group. The null hypothesis associated with this comparison 
states that there is no difference in response rates between the adalimumab and placebo groups; the 
alternative hypothesis is that the response rates are different. The response rates were tested using a 
two-sided Pearson's chi-square test with α = 0.05. Subjects with missing ASAS40 response at Week 12 
were to be treated as non-responders according to the NRI method. 
The ranked secondary efficacy endpoints were tested in hierarchical order. The first secondary 
endpoint was tested at α = 0.05; if the null hypothesis was rejected, next hypothesis in sequence was 
tested at α = 0.05; this process was to continue until the null hypothesis for a particular endpoint was 
accepted. 
Discrete variables were summarized using count and percentages and were compared between 
adalimumab and placebo groups using Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test (if ≥25% of the cells 
have expected counts less than 5). Continuous efficacy variables were to be summarized by summary 
statistics (number of subjects, mean, 95% confidence interval, standard deviation, first quartile, 
median, third quartile, minimum, maximum) at Week 12. Change from Baseline at Week 12 in the 
continuous variables was to be compared between adalimumab and placebo groups using an analysis 
of covariance method adjusting for the Baseline score. This was to be done for both observed and 
LOCF imputed values. 
The OL data (beyond Week 12) were summarized descriptively. 
Safety analyses were to be carried out using the safety population, which include all subjects that 
received at least 1 dose of study medication. Treatment-emergent, and pre- and post-treatment AEs 
were to be summarized and reported.

Results 
Participant flow and number analysed 
Study M10-791 is currently ongoing. This submission includes interim data collected from the study 
through 02 February 2011. As of this cut-off date, all active subjects have completed the 12-week DB 
phase and at least 12 weeks of OL treatment (i.e. data through Week 24 are available for all active 
subjects) and treatment was ongoing in the study as of the data cut-off. Additionally, longer-term OL 
data are included for those subjects who enrolled earlier in the study, with some subjects having 
approximately 1 year of adalimumab exposure. 
A total of 192 subjects with active axial SpA were enrolled at 37 study sites. All 192 subjects were 
randomized; however, the MAH identified an investigator noncompliance with protocol requirements at 
an investigative site. As a result of this finding, the 7 subjects enrolled at this site were excluded from 
the efficacy analyses conducted on 185 subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), but were included in the 
safety analysis. As of the data cut-off date (02 February 2011), 154 subjects were ongoing in the study 
(Figure 3). 
Table 1  Disposition of subjects (Full Analysis Set) 
The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was  "other"  (8.6%  of  all  randomised  patients),  which 
included lack of efficacy, protocol violation, investigator's decision and pregnancy; followed by adverse 
events (5.9 %). 
The flow of subjects from randomization through the cut-off date of 02 February 2011 is outlined in

Subject flow diagram (Full Analysis Set) 
Major protocol deviations, as defined according to ICH guidelines, that occurred in the FAS during the 
DB Period and the OL Period through the data cutoff date included entry criteria violations and the use 
of excluded concomitant treatment (Table 2). The FAS does not include the 7 subjects who were 
excluded from a site. Major protocol deviations which may have impacted primary efficacy analysis 
were accounted for by exclusion of the pertinent subjects from the PPP and did not impact the 
interpretation of efficacy based on the primary endpoint for the study.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol had 4 amendments. Eighty-three subjects were enrolled under the original 
protocol, one subject was enrolled under Amendment 1, 73 were enrolled under Amendment 2, 35 
Assessment report  
Page 12/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects were enrolled under Amendment 3, and no subjects were enrolled under Amendment 4.  
Amendment 1 included updates made for general consistency throughout the protocol; modifications 
made to the inclusion/exclusion criteria for clarity and added direction for the sites; clarifications of 
procedures added for direction to the sites. Amendment 2 included the correction to the SAE process 
and minor typographical errors. Amendment 3 included clarification of acceptable time frames for 
evaluations at screening of the ASAS criteria; correction and clarification to concomitant medication 
acceptability; additional clarification that the Week 12 MRI should be completed prior to Week 12 
open-label dose. Amendment 4 included the addition of a confirmatory HLA-B27 test if the result is 
initially reported as equivocal.  
Statistical Changes 
In Amendment 1, BASMI2 was changed to linear BASMI. BASMI2 was added to the non-ranked 
secondary endpoints in addition to the linear BASMI for comparison to earlier study data. The 
summarization of the anterior uveitis assessment and HCRU were also added to the non-ranked 
secondary endpoints in Protocol Amendment 1 to reflect changes in the eCRF during the study. No 
changes to the planned statistical analyses were made with Protocol Amendments 2 through 4. 
Changes from last Amendment to final statistical analysis plan: the MAH identified an investigator 
noncompliance with protocol requirements at an investigative site. As a result, all 7 subjects enrolled 
at this site were excluded from the efficacy analyses. The FAS was therefore defined in the SAP as the 
subset of the ITT population excluding subjects from the site of this investigator. All efficacy analyses 
were conducted on the FAS with the ITT population only used for sensitivity analysis. The analysis of 
categorical and continuous data was incorrectly stated in the final SAP. Treatment group homogeneity 
for categorical demographic data (sex, race, ethnicity, and age categories) was to be assessed using a 
one-way ANOVA model using treatment as the independent factor. For continuous demographic data 
(age and baseline weight), treatment group homogeneity was to be evaluated using the appropriate

Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The majority of subjects in the Full Analysis Set were female, white, and <40 years old. No statistically 
significant differences were observed between treatment groups. 
Axial SpA medical history 
Subjects reported having had symptoms of axial SpA for a mean of approximately 10 years, but the 
majority (70.3%) had been diagnosed with axial SpA for ≤ 3 years prior to Baseline. 
Approximately one-half of the subjects in each arm met the ASAS axial SpA criteria-defined evidence 
of sacroilitis on MRI (Table 3). The majority of subjects were HLA-B27-positive. Almost all subjects 
(97% in each arm) had back pain that was inflammatory in nature as defined in the ASAS axial SpA 
criteria. Less than one-half of the subjects had a history of elevated CRP. 
The majority of subjects had no history of anterior uveitis or of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's 
disease or ulcerative colitis). None of the subjects reported a history of psoriasis (this would have been 
a protocol violation as subjects with psoriasis were excluded from the study).

Baseline disease activity 
No statistically significant differences in baseline disease activity were observed between treatment 
groups. Baseline disease activity was generally similar to what has been reported for the AS population 
in the ATLAS study (Study M03-607), a global, randomized, controlled trial of adalimumab (van der 
Heijde 2006). However, Baseline BASFI and BASMI2 scores were noted to be lower than in the ATLAS 
study, implying better functionality and less spinal mobility restriction among subjects with non-
radiographic axial SpA than those with AS. There is evidence of significant baseline disease activity 
with approximately two-thirds of patients having BASDAI >6 and almost all of the subjects falling 
under the ASDAS "high" or "very high" disease activity states. Few patients had evidence of peripheral 
disease as measured by tender and swollen joint counts, dactylitis count, MASES, and 
presence/absence of plantar fasciitis. Approximately one-third of subjects had abnormal CRP (hs-CRP 
[high sensitivity] or pooled) at Baseline.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab treatment group achieved 
ASAS40 responses at Week 12 compared with placebo. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the ITT 
population to assess the impact of omitting the 7 subjects from the non-compliant site from the 
efficacy analyses, and on the PPP to assess the impact of major protocol violations. Both sensitivity 
analyses resulted in statistically significant outcomes in favor of adalimumab.

A pre-planned sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of omitting the 7 subjects from the non-
compliant site from the efficacy analyses was performed for the ranked secondary endpoints using the 
ITT population. In this sensitivity analysis, the first 5 ranked endpoints met the criteria for statistical 
significance, but ranked endpoint No. 6 (mean change from Baseline in HAQ-S total score) missed 
statistical significance (p = 0.096). Although, the hierarchical testing was interrupted with item 6 not 
meeting the requirements, the remaining ranked endpoints met the criteria for statistical significance 
in favour of the adalimumab treatment group (p value ranged from <0.001 to 0.003 compared with 
placebo). 
Supportive secondary endpoints 
Supportive efficacy endpoints assessed using observed cases (OC) at Weeks 12 and 24 demonstrated 
the effect of adalimumab on multiple components of active axial SpA. Many of these endpoints 
achieved statistical significance in favor of adalimumab at Week 12, with results being sustained or 
improving further at Week 24 (Table 9). As of the data cut-off, improvements continued to be 
observed through Week 52.

Comparison of results in subpopulations 
Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of Baseline conditions on efficacy (ASAS40 
response at Week 12). A logistic model with treatment and a prespecified subgroup in the model was 
performed to assess the treatment and subgroup interaction. If the interaction term was significant 
(P≤0.10), then treatment effect needed to be assessed for components of the subgroup. The only 
significant interaction terms were for the age category and pooled CRP subgroups (Table 10) 
Within the age category subgroup, a statistically significant treatment effect in favor of adalimumab 
was observed among subjects <40 years old (P<0.001) but not for subjects 40 to 65 years old 
(P=0.616); only 2 subjects in the adalimumab group and no subjects in the placebo group were >65 
years old, thus treatment effect could not be assessed in this age category. Within the pooled CRP 
subgroup, a statistically significant treatment effect in favor of adalimumab was observed among 
subjects with abnormal pooled CRP (P<0.001) but not among subjects with normal pooled CRP 
(P=0.199). 
These results should be considered with caution because of the limited number of patients. 
There were 3 logistic models that did not converge (race, concomitant use of NSAIDs at Baseline, and 
presence of IBD at Screening) due to insufficient data. 
Non-significant results of the interaction analyses imply that subjects who received adalimumab had 
better clinical responses compared to placebo regardless of subgroup category. The finding that there 
are overall better clinical responses with adalimumab compared to placebo in all of the subgroups 
investigated suggests a treatment benefit with adalimumab for active axial SpA patients regardless of 
the specific Baseline characteristics evaluated.

Evaluation of the primary and 9 ranked secondary endpoints at Week 12 and up to 52 weeks of

data cutoff date (02 February 2011). The primary and all ranked secondary endpoints achieved 
statistical significance in favour of adalimumab at Week 12; assessments that were conducted at later 
time points indicated continued improvements with further adalimumab treatment.

1.2.2.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study M10-791 
The clinical development program for adalimumab in subjects with severe nr-axSpA included a single 
pivotal Phase 3 study, Study M10-791. This was a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized 
study in subjects with active axial SpA who had an inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or more 
NSAIDs, or a contraindication for NSAIDs. Study M10-791 was ongoing at the time of submission of 
this application. A data cut-off of 02 February 2011 was used for this submission. As of the data cut-off 
date, 154 subjects were ongoing in the study and 166 patients completed week 24 (80 ADA/ADA arm 
and 86 PBO/ADA arm).  Data from this study form the basis for all efficacy data to support the claimed 
indication.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of Study M10-791, aimed to improve clinical signs and symptoms of active axial SpA, 
reflects the recommendation of the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the 
treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (CPMP/EWP/489/03). The objective of the study was to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of SC adalimumab 40 mg given eow compared to placebo for 12 weeks followed 
by OL safety and efficacy assessments in subjects with active axial SpA not fulfilling the modified New 
York criteria for AS who had an inadequate response to, or intolerance to 1 or more NSAIDs, or had a 
contraindication for NSAIDs. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects who achieved 
ASAS40 response at the Week 12 visit. ASAS response is a composite variable assessing four domains: 
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (represented by the Patient's Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity VAS score), Pain (represented by the total back pain VAS score), Function 
(represented by the BASFI score) and Inflammation (represented by the mean of the 2 morning 
stiffness-related BASDAI VAS scores). It is an established outcome measure for AS, but is not 
validated for spondyloarthritis. There is no regulatory guideline describing the endpoints for evaluating 
treatments of axial spondyloarthritis,however, the CHMP considered justified to use ASAS response as 
AS is the most representative type of axial SpA (CPMP/EWP/4891/03).  
The primary endpoint ASAS40 at week 12, a composite efficacy endpoint requiring a relative 
improvement of ≥40% and absolute improvement of ≥20 units (on a scale of 0 to 100) from Baseline 
in ≥3 of these 4 domains, without worsening in the remaining domains, is considered a stringent tool 
to evaluate adalimumab efficacy. The specified 9 ranked secondary endpoints at Week 12 aimed to 
assess inflammation, spinal mobility, symptoms of pain, discomfort, stiffness and fatigue, patient’s 
global status are in line with the guideline. The choice of the mean change in SPARCC MRI score for the 
sacroiliac joints, as MRI scoring system for grading inflammation is considered acceptable as results 
obtained with this score are reproducible and reliable. 
Concerning the inclusion and exclusion criteria the CHMP considered that they were reasonable in 
relation to the proposed axial spondyloarthritis classification criteria and the well known safety profile 
of adalimumab. During the procedure, the MAH clarified that the inadequate response to NSAIDs, in 
terms of doses and treatment duration, was not univocally defined but based on investigator’s expert 
discretion as for local standard of care and that the same definition was previously used in other 
adalimumab clinical trials i.e. in M03-607 which is the pivotal study for AS indication. Almost all 
patients have been treated with at least one NSAID and more than one third (36.3%) took 2 NSAIDs 
before study entry. Patient’s distribution according to the number of NSAIDs prior to baseline is 
considered well balanced between adalimumab group and placebo. The reported mean and median 
duration of NSAID use is in line with the natural history of axial SpA. The results indicated that the 
duration of prior NSAID use (≥ versus < median duration of 20.5 months) did not affect the likelihood 
of achieving Week 12 ASAS40 response. 
Assessment report  
Page 21/43
 
 
 
 
In the inclusion criterion: “MRI evidence of active inflammatory lesions of sacroiliac joints (past or 
present) with definite bone marrow oedema/osteitis”, the MAH clarified that the protocol did not 
specify the allowed interval between a "past" positive MRI and Baseline visit. However, of the 89 
subjects who were reported to have "MRI evidence of active inflammatory lesions of SI joints," only 9 
were based on "past" MRI findings. Six had past MRI within 12 months or less prior to the Baseline 
visit, while 3 had past MRI anywhere from 3 to 5 years prior to the Baseline visit. For completeness a 
revised subgroup analysis excluding the 3 patients was submitted. The week 12 ASAS40 response was 
similar to that in the previous analysis. Based on the non-significant interaction P value, past or 
present MRI evidence of sacroiliitis does not influence Week 12 ASAS40 results. 
Generally, the main inclusion criteria were consistent with the ASAS criteria for axial spondyloarthritis, 
with the modification that psoriasis was excluded as criterion and that established AS i.e. radiographic 
signs of inflammation of the SI joints was not allowed. The ASAS criteria for Axial SpA include both AS 
and psoriatic arthritis but these conditions, for which the MAH already hold a marketing authorization 
were contraindications for entering the study to avoid a bias. 
The demographic characteristics of enrolled patients were well balanced between the placebo and 
adalimumab groups. As current evidence suggests that obesity is associated with a lower response to 
various biologic agents in RA and spondyloarthritides, the MAH provided information on the subjects 
Body Mass Index (BMI). Mean BMI at Baseline was similar between adalimumab and placebo groups. 
Approximately 45% of the subjects in the study had normal BMI.  
Baseline patients’ characteristics were also well balanced and representative of the studied population. 
Patients had axial SpA symptoms for a mean of approximately 10 years before enrolment. This time 
period is similar to that reported in the ATLAS study, the pivotal registration study for the indication of 
adalimumab in AS.  
Almost all subjects (97% in each arm) had back pain that was inflammatory in nature as defined in the 
ASAS axial SpA criteria. Less than 40% of the subjects had a history of elevated CRP. The majority of 
subjects had no history of anterior uveitis or of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or 
ulcerative colitis). In half of the enrolled patients (45.7% placebo and 50.5% adalimumab) past or  
present evidence of active inflammatory lesions on MRI of sacroiliac joint was documented. The 
majority of subjects were HLA-B27-positive. As no grading of baseline inflammation has been initially 
presented, the MAH reported the number of subjects who had the SPARCC MRI score for both 
sacroiliac joints and for spine unchanged, improved (decreased) or worsened(increased) from baseline 
to week 12. Overall, at Week 12, more subjects in the adalimumab arm had improvement (any 
decrease) in their MRI scores for the SI joints and spine. Although similar percentages of patients had 
worsening (any increase) in the SI joint MRI SPARCC scores, there were more subjects in the placebo 
arm who had worse spine MRI SPARCC scores compared to the adalimumab group. There were more 
subjects in the placebo arm that had unchanged MRI scores at Week 12, but almost half of these 
subjects had scores >0, whereas most of the subjects in the adalimumab arm who had unchanged MRI 
scores had baseline scores of 0. Among patients (SI joints and spine) who had SPARCC score at week 
12 unchanged, the large majority (79% SI joints and 60% spine in adalimumab group) had baseline 
score equal to zero.  
The baseline disease activity status of patients enrolled in the M10-791 study was high in score 
(ASDAS mean values 3.36 placebo and 3.22 adalimumab) and comparable between placebo and 
adalimumab arm. The disease activity status was also generally similar to that reported in the ATLAS 
study, except for functional indices such as the BASFI and the BASMI which were lower in the M10-791 
study. The BASFI score, assessed with 0-10 cm VAS, was 5.6 placebo - 5.2 adalimumab mean values 
in the ATLAS study and 4.8 placebo-4.5 ADA mean values in the M10-791 study. The baseline BASMI2 
based on 0-2 scale for each of the 5 clinical measurements, was 4.2 placebo - 3.8 adalimumab mean 
Assessment report  
Page 22/43
 
 
 
 
values in the ATLAS study and 1.8 placebo - 1.8 adalimumab mean values in the M10-791 study. This 
difference implies a better functionality and spinal mobility of patients diagnosed with nr-axSpA (M10-
791 study) compared with AS patients (ATLAS study) which reflect the common clinical presentation of 
the two forms of spondyloarthritis. 
Efficacy data and additional analysis 
A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab treatment group achieved 
ASAS40 responses at Week 12 compared with placebo (36.3% vs 14.9%; p<0.001). Sensitivity 
analyses were performed on the ITT population to assess the impact of omitting the 7 subjects from 
the non-compliant site from the efficacy analyses, and on the PPP to assess the impact of major 
protocol violations. Both sensitivity analyses resulted in statistically significant outcomes in favor of 
adalimumab (ITT: 14.4 vs 34.7; p<0.001 and PPP: 14.1 vs 35.9; p<0.002). These results, both in the 
primary analysis and in all sensitivity analyses, show a significant and robust clinical benefit of 
adalimumab treatment in axial SpA at 12 week. 
Seven (7) patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis, after their site was closed due to 
compliance issues. In addition, a total of 25 subjects did not meet entry criteria but still received study 
medication. Seven (7) of these do not appear to have met the proposed axial spondyloarthritis criteria. 
For another 4 patients, concomitant medication issues were reported. From a GCP standpoint, a total 
of 29 major protocol deviations is a high number in relation to the total number of subjects enrolled. 
However, as they are evenly distributed between the 2 groups they have not affected the overall 
results. 
The Week 12 data analysis shows that there was a statistically significant difference in favour of 
adalimumab 40 mg eow versus placebo for all 9 ranked secondary efficacy endpoints. As expected, a 
higher percentage of patients (30.9% placebo and 51.6% adalimumab) reached the ASAS20 endpoint 
as compared to ASAS40. Consistent results were observed in the in SPARCC MRI score with 
adalimumab-treated patients showing a significant reduction (mean change from baseline±SD) for 
both sacroiliac joints (-0.6 ±6.19 PBO group and -3.2 ±8.34 adalimumab group, p=0.003) as well as 
for spine (-0.2±3.32 PBO group and -1.8 ±4.51 ADA group, p=0.001).  
Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of Baseline conditions on efficacy (ASAS40 
response at Week 12). The only significant interaction terms were for the age category and pooled CRP 
subgroups, where the subgroup with elevated CRP showed a statistically significant treatment effect in 
favour of adalimumab (P <0.001) but not among subjects with normal pooled CRP. Within the age 
category subgroup, a statistically significant treatment effect in favor of adalimumab was observed 
among subjects <40 years old (P <0.001) but not for subjects 40 to 65 years old (P = 0.616).  
During the procedure the CHMP questioned the reliability, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of 
the ASAS classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis to define a subgroup with early axial 
spondylarthritis who could benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. The new criteria allow for 
identification of patients before the apparition of radiographic changes of the SI joints, which can take 
several years after the start of symptoms. Nevertheless, as the diagnosis of nr-axSpA does not require 
the presence of active inflammation as detected by MRI of the SI joints or spine, there is a potential to 
treat patients with no inflammatory back pain. The problem of delayed AS diagnosis was acknowledged 
by the CHMP, however, little is known about what proportion of nr-axSpA patients actually develop AS.  
The MAH presented further data in order to demonstrate that the ASAS classification criteria for axial 
spondyloarthritis were sufficiently reliable, sensitive, specific and predictive to define a subgroup with 
non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis who could benefit from the treatment. The MAH compared the 
ASAS criteria for axial SpA to other SpA criteria. The ASAS criteria were shown to be superior both 
Assessment report  
Page 23/43
 
 
 
 
 
regarding specificity and sensitivity. The MAH clarified that the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the 
proposed ASAS criteria for Axial Spondyloarthritis has been calculated to be 89% in the targeted 
cohort where the prevalence of disease was 60%. To further address the CHMP’s concerns, and 
consistent with the ASAS recommendation, the MAH proposed to require that nr-axSpA patients who 
are candidates for adalimumab treatment exhibit objective measures of inflammation by elevated CRP 
or MRI, in addition to having severe active disease despite treatment with NSAIDs. The CHMP 
acknowledged that requiring the presence of a positive MRI or elevated CRP improves the specificity of 
the adalimumab treatment patient population, thereby reducing the likelihood that a patient without 
nr-axSpA will be treated with adalimumab. In addition, a publication from Rudwaleit et al (Rudwaleit et 
al, Ann Rheum Dis 2009), where the ASAS criteria for AxSpA are presented, showed that in the 
presence of positive MRI the PPV raised to 97.5 in the 60% cohort, which constitute a significant 
improvement.  
In addition to improving the specificity of the adalimumab treatment patient population, this 
modification is supported by the results of the subgroup interaction analyses for Study M10-791. In 
that study, patients with elevated (abnormal) CRP levels had an approximately 2-fold greater likelihood 
of clinical response based on the Week 12 ASAS40 response. Patients with a baseline MRI SPARCC SI 
joint score ≥2 had a numerically higher response rate than those with a score <2, although the P value 
for the interaction analysis for subgroups based on baseline MRI SPARCC SI joint score was not 
statistically significant. However, a significant interaction with treatment was observed based on 
logistic regression between continuous MRI SPARCC SI joint scores at baseline and ASAS40 response 
at Week 12 (P = 0.046, NRI). Of the patients with a MRI SPARCC SI joint score of < 2 at baseline, 
49% had objective evidence of inflammation in the spine on MRI with a baseline MRI SPARCC spine 
score of ≥ 2. Thus, the same analysis was conducted for subgroups based on baseline SPARCC scores 
of ≥ 2 for either the SI joint or spine compared to those who had scores < 2 for both SI joint and 
spine, and a similar trend was noted. The same analysis was also conducted for the target nr-axSpA 
population (positive MRI defined by a SPARCC score ≥ 2 for either the SI joint or spine, or elevated 
CRP). The Week 12 ASAS40 response was significantly higher in the ADA group compared to PBO for 
the proposed candidate nr-axSpA population for adalimumab therapy (PBO = 13.7%, ADA = 40.6%, P 
< 0.001, NRI), but there was no difference in clinical response between PBO and ADA among patients 
who did not have a positive MRI or elevated CRP. The interaction analysis did not result in a significant 
P value, but it should be noted that the patient population that did not have a positive MRI or elevated 
CRP was quite small (PBO, n = 20; ADA, n = 22). All 9 ranked secondary efficacy endpoints for Study 
M10-791 also met statistical significance when analyzed for the proposed nr-axSpA population with a 
positive MRI or elevated CRP at baseline, further supporting the efficacy of adalimumab in this 
subgroup of nr-axSpA patients. 
Taken all this information together, requiring that candidates for adalimumab treatment exhibit 
objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP or MRI increases the specificity in identifying the 
target population and reduces considerably the possibility of treating patients with non inflammatory 
disease. Also, based on the data presented, this allows identifying a subgroup of patients with non-
radiographic axial spondylarthritis who benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. For clarification 
the CHMP required a change to the indication wording requiring the presence of an elevated CRP 
and/or a positive MRI in the target population to make clear that patients displaying both signs of 
inflammation are also covered in the indication. This was accepted by the MAH. 
One aim of early treatment of axial spondylarthritis with a biologic could be to reduce the risk for 
progression to AS, with associated structural damage. No data are available to confirm whether any 
treatment intervention for nr-axSpA can slow or prevent the progression to AS. Due to the relatively 
slower radiographic progression in axial SpA compared to other rheumatologic diseases such as RA, 
and varying degrees by which patients progress, it is not ethical to conduct a controlled clinical trial to 
Assessment report  
Page 24/43
 
 
 
 
assess the impact of adalimumab treatment on progression of nr-axSpA to AS. Regardless of any 
potential impact of adalimumab treatment on the long term progression of nr-axSpA, treatment of the 
signs and symptoms of disease, as shown by the results of study M10-791, is considered clinically 
relevant. 
Long-term efficacy up to Week 52 was assessed through the OL phase of the M10-791 study during 
which placebo–treated patients were shifted to adalimumab treatment. Results for primary and ranked 
secondary endpoints (ASAS20, ASAS40, ASAS 5/6, ASAS partial remission, and BASDAI50) for 
PBL/ADA-treated patients and ADA-ADA treated patients have been separately reported at week 24, 36 
and 52. Overall a clinical benefit of adalimumab treatment was observed for all endpoints throughout 
the 12-52 week period. Patients switched to ADA treatment from PBL achieved ASAS20, ASAS40, 
ASAS 5/6, ASAS partial remission, and BASDAI50 response by Week 24 (i.e. after 12 weeks of OL 
adalimumab treatment) at a rate comparable to that seen in patients treated with ADA/ADA patients at 
both Week 12 and 24. Additional data up to Week 68 became available during the procedure, with all 
remaining patients having now received at least 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab in the open-
label phase of the study. The observed clinical response rates at Week 12 were, in those patients who 
maintained in the study, sustained up to Week 68. In these patients, both HAQ-s and SF-35 improved 
between Week 12 and 52. Overall, the observed clinical response rates were sustained up to Week 68 
of the study, supporting the durability of clinical response and benefit of continued adalimumab 
therapy up to 68 weeks. Within this procedure the MAH extended the duration of Study M10-791 from 
2 to 3 years after which supplementary data would become available to further describe adalimumab 
long term efficacy. As described in the RMP the MAH will submit the final results of Study M10-791 by 
Q4 2013. 
There are current data in the literature3,4 suggesting that continuous anti-TNF therapy is needed for 
nr-axSpA patients to maintain clinical response or remission over time. To further validate thes
e 
observations in a controlled setting, the MAH committed to conduct a post-approval randomized, 
controlled, remission-withdrawal-retreatment study in nr-axSpA subjects who have had an inadequate 
response to at least 2 NSAIDs or are intolerant or have a contraindication for NSAIDs. The results of 
such a study will provide information on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom 
there is no disease activity following treatment for 24 weeks; what proportion of patients treated early 
in their disease achieve remission and also on the safety and efficacy of re-treatment after disease 
flare. Active disease for study entry will be defined as BASDAI ≥ 4 on a numerical rating scale, ASDAS 
≥2.1, and total back pain ≥4 on a numerical rating scale. The study will have 2 treatment periods. In 
Period 1, all subjects will receive open-label adalimumab for 24 weeks. Those who achieve ASDAS 
Inactive Disease (ASDAS <1.3) at Weeks 20 and 24 of open-label adalimumab treatment will be 
randomized in a blinded manner to continued adalimumab therapy or placebo (withdrawal of therapy) 
during Period 2. Subjects who flare during Period 2 will be provided rescue therapy with open-label 
adalimumab. The MAH will provide the results of this study by Q3 2015 as described in the RMP. 
1.2.2.3. Additional expert consultation  
During the procedure at the CHMP’s request an ad-hoc expert group meeting was organized. Amongst 
the experts there was a consensus that Axial Spondyloarthritis is a clinical entity established in the 
rheumatology community and that symptom control is an acceptable treatment goal. The responses to 
the four questions asked to the experts by the CHMP are reproduced below.

1. 
Is the new clinical entity Axial Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) established enough in the 
rheumatology community to justify its adding as an indication? 
There was consensus amongst the experts that AxSpA is a clinical entity sufficiently established 
nowadays in the rheumatology community. Whether this would justify as an indication was 
subject to debate with a majority of experts in favour of not considering this diagnosis 
classification as an indication on its own. It was agreed that this entity was recognised as a way 
of classifying a group of patients but this differed from identifying a group of patients who 
needed treatment. Therefore, other parameters such as the severity should be taken into 
account to define a sub-group of patients with AxSpA for whom treatment is indicated. One 
expert however recognized AxSpA as an established clinical entity as well as an established 
indication.  
2.  What would be the aim of anti-TNF treatment in this population? If the aim is symptomatic 
treatment, what would the appropriate study duration be to define the   benefit for such 
treatment?  
There was a consensus amongst the experts that the aim of anti-TNF treatment in AxSpA is 
symptom control. The experts also agreed that it is unknown whether such treatment has an 
impact on the structural damage.  
From a clinician’s perspective the aim of symptomatic treatment was deemed valuable even 
without knowing whether the treatment could slow-down structural damage. The patient 
representatives stressed that minimising the symptoms (e.g. pain) as much as possible is of 
particular relevance (“it is the 1st priority for the patients”).  
The experts agreed that a 3 month period could be considered as sufficient to define the benefit 
of symptomatic treatment. It will be important nevertheless to perform a long term follow-up of 
patients to investigate the impact on disease’s progression as well as the long term safety in this 
patient population. The duration of such follow-up should be > 1 years (2-3 years was 
mentioned). It was generally agreed that long term follow-up of patients through a registry 
would be extremely valuable. 
Furthermore, the relapse study proposed by the applicant was considered important.  
3. 
AxSpA includes patients with and without signs of sacroiliitis on MRI. Is there reason to make a 
distinction regarding treatment strategy between these two groups? 
Based on the applicant’s data and results the experts recognised that patients who show 
objective evidences of inflammation by MRI [MRI (+)] and by CRP [CRP (+)] benefit the most 
from the anti-TNF treatment compared to MRI (–) and CRP (-) patients. As such MRI constitutes 
important and helpful criteria to anticipate a clinical response. Nevertheless there was discussion 
amongst the experts to which extent MRI can be used to decide whether treatment should be 
initiated or not.  It was mentioned that MRI has a sensitivity of ~60% therefore other 
concomitant criteria must be met for a diagnosis of AxSpA (inflammatory back pain, uveitis, 
HLA-B27 (+), elevated CRP, etc...) in order to trigger anti-TNF treatment.  
Overall, the majority of experts agreed that MRI was seen as one potential helpful tool to 
identify a group of patients for treatment, although there might be other diagnostic tools. One 
expert voiced that the clinical diagnosis of inflammatory back pain needs to be taken into 
consideration.  
Discussing the complexity, as an example MRI (+) patients treated by NSAIDs could become 
MRI (-) although not responding anymore to NSAIDs and might benefit from anti-TNF treatment. 
Assessment report  
Page 26/43
 
 
 
 
 
Also it was pointed out that some patients can be without signs of sacroiliitis on MRI but display 
inflammatory signs in the spine on MRI and hence be eligible for the anti-TNF treatment.  
4. 
Are there criteria which are sufficiently precise and validated that can be used to define a 
subpopulation of the nra AxSpA population who could benefit from anti-TNF treatment? 
The experts agreed that the criterion “patients presenting inflammatory chronic back pain with 
age of onset <45 years and who have had inadequate response to, or intolerance to NSAIDs 
together with objective evidence of inflammation by MRI or by CRP” allow to define enough a 
subgroup of patients who could benefit most from an anti-TNF treatment. These criteria were 
seen as sufficient to define a subgroup of patients that had been shown to particularly benefit 
from anti-TNF treatment in the trial that had already been conducted by the applicant.  
The experts agreed that the history of NSAID use was important to consider and that more than 
one NSAID should be used in appropriate doses before anti-TNF treatment was initiated in this 
condition. The experts mentioned that further subgroup analysis of this trial might be useful to 
optimise efficacy possibly by taking into account variables such as the degree of elevation in CRP 
and the MRI appearances. 
1.2.2.4. Conclusion on clinical efficacy  
The submission is based on a single pivotal Phase 3 study, Study M10-791, in about 192 adult subjects 
with nr-axSpA randomized to adalimumab 40mg eow or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Thereafter, all 
received open label adalimumab. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an 
ASAS40 response at Week 12. The Week 12 analysis showed that a statistically significantly greater 
proportion of subjects in the adalimumab treatment group achieved ASAS40 responses compared with 
placebo. Similar results were observed using the Per Protocol Population (35.9% versus 14.1%, P = 
0.002). Consistent results were obtained in an ITT sensitivity analysis (ITT: 14.4% vs 34.7%, 
p<0.001). Significant effects were also demonstrated at week 12 for all ranked secondary efficacy 
endpoints, including two MRI endpoints (SPARCC MRI score sacroiliac joints, and for the spine, 
p=0.003 and 0.001, respectively). In addition a number of “supportive secondary endpoints” were 
assessed with an overall pattern of results favoring active treatment. This is overall considered a 
robust effect, and of clinical relevance in terms of symptomatic treatment. A clinical benefit of 
adalimumab treatment was also observed for all endpoints throughout the 12-52 week period. 
Additional data up to 68 weeks showed that the observed clinical response rates at Week 12 were 
sustained up to Week 68. As described in the RMP the MAH will submit the final results of Study 
M10-791 Q4 2013 which will bring additional data to further characterize the long term benefit of 
adalimumab treatment of nr-axSpA patients. 
During the procedure the CHMP questioned reliability, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the 
ASAS classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis to define a subgroup with early axial 
spondylarthritis who could benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. As the diagnosis of nr-axSpA 
does not require the presence of active inflammation as detected by MRI, there is a potential to treat 
patients with no inflammatory back pain. As the data presented showed that patients with evidence of 
either inflammation on MRI of either the spine or SI joints, or an elevated CRP, are more likely to 
achieve better clinical responses to adalimumab, the MAH proposed to require the presence of an 
elevated CRP or a positive MRI in the target population in addition to having severe active disease 
despite treatment with NSAIDs. The CHMP agreed with this measure as it helps reducing considerably 
the possibility of treating patients with non inflammatory disease and thereby identifies a population in 
whom the benefit/risk balance is positive. For clarification the CHMP required a change to the wording 
requiring the presence of an elevated CRP and/or a positive MRI in the target population to make clear 
Assessment report  
Page 27/43
 
 
 
 
 
that patients displaying both signs of inflammation are also covered in the indication. This was 
accepted by the MAH.  
Overall the CHMP agreed that the original AS indication remains unchanged and is supplemented with 
the indication in the treatment of patient with axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of 
AS but who display objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI. Both indications are 
under a common heading of axial spondyloarthritis.  
1.2.3  
Clinical safety 
Safety data were collected in the form of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, and 
laboratory tests throughout the treatment period and up to 70 days after the last injection of the study 
drug. Safety data with a cutoff date of 02 February 2011 were assessed. Two datasets were utilized for 
the analysis of safety: 
1. 
The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of the study drug 
(placebo subjects =97; adalimumab subjects =95; total subjects =192). Safety analyses were 
conducted according to the actual treatment received by subjects, irrespective of treatment 
group assignment. No subjects were excluded from the safety analyses. 
2. 
The Any Adalimumab Safety Set is comprised of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 
dose of adalimumab any time during the study (placebo subjects [in the open-label phase] 
=95; adalimumab subjects =95; total subjects =190). No subjects were excluded from the 
safety analyses. 
Patient exposure 
The majority of subjects (180 of 185 subjects; 97.3%) received at least 76 days of the study 
treatment during the DB period with a total of 41.6 patient-years (PY) of exposure to the study drug 
(table 10). Among subjects exposed to adalimumab at any time during the study, a majority (142 of 
190 subjects; 74.7%) received at least 175 days of treatment with adalimumab with a total of 131.1 
PY of exposure to adalimumab.

Note: 
If a subject discontinued during the DB period of the study, then the duration of exposure was the number of days 
between the first dose of study drug and the last dose if study drug + 14 days.  If a subject continued into the OL period 
of the study, then the duration of exposure was the number of days between the first dose of study drug and the day prior 
to the first OL dose. 
Adverse events 
All AEs discussed are treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), unless otherwise noted. TEAEs are defined as 
AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of the study medication, and up to 70 days after the last

dose of the study medication. The only exception was for those subjects who continued on adalimumab 
therapy after the end of study participation. These subjects were not required to complete the 70-day 
follow-up and any new AEs were reported through the mechanism used for all post-marketing adverse 
experiences. 
All AEs were collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. In addition, serious 
AEs (SAEs) were collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent. SAEs 
are defined as AEs that resulted in death, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, spontaneous or elective abortion, an important 
medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome, and AEs that were 
life-threatening. 
During the DB period of the study, the most frequently reported AE were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and 
headache in the adalimumab group and nausea and diarrhoea in the placebo group (Table 13). All 
other AEs were reported by <5% of subjects in either the placebo or adalimumab treatment groups.

More subjects in the adalimumab treatment group (32.6%) compared with the placebo group (21.6%) 
reported AEs that the investigator considered possibly or probably related to study drug (table 15). 
The frequency of any specific possibly or probably related AEs were similar between treatment groups. 
However, more subjects in the adalimumab treatment group reported injection site reactions (4.2%) 
and nasopharyngitis (7.4%) compared with placebo (0 and 1.0%, respectively). Other frequently 
reported (3%) possibly or probably related AEs were injection site erythema, injection site pain, and 
nausea. All other events were reported by <3% of subjects in either treatment group.

Adverse events of special interest were specifically monitored. These events were of special interest 
because they were considered potential safety issues due to the immunomodulating mechanism of 
action of adalimumab or due to higher rates of some events in the axial SpA population. The results 
showed that no cases of opportunistic or parasitic infections, PML, malignancies (including lymphomas, 
NMSC, melanoma, HSTCL, and leukemia), lupus-like syndrome, demyelinating disease, hematologic 
events, cutaneous and noncutaneous vasculitis, diverticulitis, intestinal perforation related events, 
intestinal stricture related events, CV events (including MI, CVA, and CHF), pulmonary embolism, 
interstitial lung disease, medication error related events, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema 
multiforme-related events, pancreatitis, sarcoidosis, RPLS, or ALS were reported during the study. 
Deaths 
A male with a history of heavy alcohol use and anxiety who received placebo during the DB period of 
the study experienced intermittent headaches beginning on Day 2, sinusitis on Day 24 that ended on 
Day 32, abdominal bloating on Day 59, and diarrhoea on Day 84. All of these events were not serious 
and considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator. The subject continued into the OL 
period of the study and withdrew consent for lack of efficacy. The subject committed suicide on Day

223 (40 days after the last dose of adalimumab).  The investigator assessed this event as not related 
to study drug. 
Events of special interest 
Infections and serious infections 
Infections were reported by 45.8% of subjects during any adalimumab exposure throughout the study.  
The most frequently reported infections were nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and upper 
respiratory tract infection; all other infections were reported by <5% of subjects each

No serious infections were reported during the DB period of the study. Three subjects reported serious 
infections during the OL period of the study; 1 subject who received placebo in the DB period 
(postoperative wound infection) and 2 subjects who received treatment with adalimumab in the DB 
period (TB, sinusitis) 
The TB case was a 20 year old white male who was PPD negative at Screening and had no known risk 
factors for TB, reported pulmonary TB on Day 274. Subsequently, the subject was hospitalized and 
discontinued study drug. The event was ongoing as of Day 380. The investigator considered this event 
to be probably related to study drug. 
Psoriatic Condition 
Two subjects with no prior history of psoriasis discontinued adalimumab treatment due to an AE of new 
onset psoriasis on Day 116 and Day 257. The events were described as mild in severity and reported 
as probably (psoriasis) and possibly (guttate psoriasis) related to study drug.  
Injection Site Reactions 
During the DB period of the study, injection site reactions were reported by 8.4% of subjects in the 
adalimumab treatment group and 3.1% of subjects in the placebo group. Among subjects who 
received adalimumab at any time during the study, 8.9% reported injection site reactions. 
No individual injection site reaction-related AE term was reported by more than 4.2% of subjects in 
any treatment group. Injection site pain was reported by 1.1% of subjects treated with adalimumab 
Assessment report  
Page 34/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during the DB period. All injection site reactions were considered possibly or probably related to study 
drug by the investigator, except for 1 event during the OL period which was assessed to be not related. 
The most frequently reported injection site reaction-related AE terms in the DB period of the study and 
among subjects who received adalimumab at any time during the study were injection site reaction 
and injection site erythema. 
Allergic Reactions 
No serious allergic reactions were reported during the study.  Two subjects, 1 in each of the placebo 
and adalimumab treatment groups, reported allergic reactions during the DB period of the study 
(urticaria and eyelid edema, moderate and mild in severity, respectively). No other allergic reactions 
were reported. 
Hepatic-Related Events 
Hepatic-related events were infrequent and no individual hepatic-related AE term was reported by 
more than 2 subjects in any treatment group.  One subject in the adalimumab treatment group 
reported acute hepatitis during the DB period of the study: a male with a relevant history of current 
moderate alcohol use (2 to 4 drinks/day), who had a positive screening PPD test with subsequent 
isoniazid prophylaxis and received adalimumab in the DB period of the study, experienced severe acute 
hepatitis with onset on Day 1. The subject was hospitalized on Day 23. Isoniazid and adalimumab were 
discontinued due to the event, with the last dose of each drug administered on Day 15. Treatment 
medication for the event included enoxaparin. The subject was discharged from the hospital on Day 26, 
and the event was considered resolved on Day 50. The investigator considered this event probably not 
related to study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
Statistically significant mean changes in haematology parameters during the DB period of the study, 
from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 12, were observed between the placebo and adalimumab treatment 
groups for haemoglobin and platelets. Anaemia and elevated platelet counts can be associated with 
ongoing inflammation. Overall, mean increases in haemoglobin and mean decreases in platelets were 
observed for the duration of the study.   
Other hematologic parameters remained essentially constant throughout the study, with mean changes 
from Baseline that were not considered clinically meaningful. 
Although some statistically significant differences were observed between the placebo and adalimumab 
treatment groups, overall, none of the mean changes in clinical chemistry parameters from Baseline 
during the DB period of the study to Weeks 4, 8, and 12 was considered clinically meaningful. 
Overall clinical chemistry parameters remained stable throughout the study duration (from the first 
dose of adalimumab through 12, 24, 36, 52, and 60 weeks of adalimumab exposure). None of the 
mean changes from Baseline was considered clinically meaningful. Although a trend for slight increases 
in cholesterol and triglycerides was noted, these tests were done on non-fasting samples. 
Changes in liver function tests meeting the criteria for potential clinical significance (ALT, AST, or 
alkaline phosphatase ≥2.5 ×ULN or total bilirubin ≥1.5×ULN) were infrequent during the DB period of 
the study. All alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin values were <1.5 ×ULN.   
Assessment report  
Page 35/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elevations in ALT and AST rarely exceeded 3 × ULN: 1 subject in the adalimumab treatment group 
(Subject 2102) experienced ALT and AST elevations of ≥8 × ULN (this subject reported an AE of acute 
hepatitis on Day 1 of the DB period), 1 subject in the placebo group (Subject 4603) experienced an 
ALT ≥ 3 ×ULN, and 1 subject in the adalimumab treatment group (Subject 502) experienced AST 
elevations ≥ 3 ×ULN. 
Changes in liver function tests meeting the criteria for potential clinical significance were also 
infrequent during any adalimumab exposure. In addition to those subjects treated with adalimumab 
experiencing elevated LFTs during the DB period, one additional subject (Subject 4705) had transient 
AST elevations of ≥5 × ULN during the OL period. No subjects experienced ALT elevation ≥3 × ULN 
during the OL period. All LFT elevations, other than for the case of acute hepatitis, which resulted in 
study discontinuation, resolved before the final dose of study drug. All other LFT values were <3 ×≥ 
ULN throughout any adalimumab exposure during the study. 
Shifts in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters were infrequent and were not considered 
clinically meaningful in the DB period or during any adalimumab exposure.  Shifts in urinalysis 
parameters during the DB period and during any adalimumab exposure were infrequent and were not 
considered clinically meaningful. 
Most elevations in clinical chemistry values were transient and resolved prior to the final value. Four 
subjects had CTCAE toxicity grade 3 at the final visit (that includes cases of hyperuricaemia, elevated 
uric acid, hyperglycemia and elevated triglycerides). 
Safety in special populations 
No clinically meaningful differences in AEs were observed by subgroups (sex, age, and weight) 
examined.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interactions were not evaluated. No clinically meaningful differences in AEs were observed by 
subgroups (DMARD and NSAID use) examined.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Within the DB period and among subjects who received adalimumab at any time during the study, all 
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 1 subject each, with the exception of headache (2 
subjects in the Any Adalimumab group). A listing of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs leading to 
discontinuation that were considered possibly or probably related to study drug by the investigator 
during the study is provided in table 19.

Post marketing experience 
No post marketing data is available for the use in axial SpA. The following summarises the experience 
across other approved indications. The safety profile of adalimumab is well established. Treatment with 
adalimumab is connected with several potentially serious risks. There have been infrequent post-
marketing reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis following Humira administration. A 
causal relationship with adalimumab therapy has not been established. Rare post-marketing reports of 
HSTCL, a rare and aggressive lymphoma, have been identified in patients treated with adalimumab. 
Most of the patients had prior infliximab therapy as well as concomitant azathioprine or 
6 mercaptopurine use for CD and UC. The causal association of HSTCL with adalimumab is not clear. 
Additionally, rare events of cutaneous vasculitis, reactivation of hepatitis B, demyelinating disorders 
(e.g. optic neuritis, Guillain − Barré syndrome), intestinal perforation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
erythema multiforme, angioedema, alopecia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, lupus-
like syndrome, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis have been 
reported during post-marketing use of adalimumab as well as cases of diverticulitis, and new onset or 
worsening psoriasis. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size; 
therefore, it is not possible to reliably establish a causal relationship to adalimumab exposure.

1.2.3.1. Discussion on clinical safety 
The most frequently reported AE during the DB phase were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and headache. 
Among subjects who received adalimumab at any time during the study through the data cutoff, the 
most frequently reported AE included nasopharyngitis, spondylitis, diarrhea, headache, nausea, 
sinusitis, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. Among subjects who received adalimumab at 
any time during the study through the data cutoff, the most frequently reported possibly or probably 
related AEs were nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site 
reactions, and injection site erythema. The frequencies of possibly or probably related AE terms were 
similar between treatment groups. However, more subjects in the adalimumab treatment group 
reported injection site reactions (4.2%) and nasopharyngitis (7.4%) compared with placebo (0 and 
1.0%, respectively). Other frequently reported (≥3%) possibly or probably related AEs were injection 
site erythema and nausea. All other events were reported by <3% of subjects in either treatment 
group. 
Overall the majority of AEs reported in the DB phase were mild or moderate in severity. The AEs 
classified as possibly or probably related to the study drug where AEs already known and reported in 
previous adalimumab studies.  
The SAEs experienced by patients either during the DB period as well as at any time throughout the 
study were reported by one subject each. The subjects who experienced a serious event (during 
administration of adalimumab at any time throughout the study) were 13 (6.8%) of whom 4 (2.1%) 
had a SAE possibly drug-related, as assessed by the investigators. The majority of SAEs were 
considered not related or probably not related to treatment by the investigator. One death in the 
adalimumab group (suicide) occurred in the study but was assessed as not related to the study drug. 
Known serious adverse events with adalimumab or other anti-TNF agents were also evaluated. No 
cases of opportunistic or parasitic infections, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, malignancies 
(including lymphomas, NMSC, melanoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, and leukemia), lupus-like 
syndrome, Demyelinating disease, hematologic events, cutaneous and noncutaneous vasculitis, 
diverticulitis, intestinal perforation related events, intestinal stricture related events, cardiovascular 
events (including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and congestive heart failure), 
pulmonary embolism, interstitial lung disease, medication error related events, Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, erythema multiforme related events, pancreatitis, sarcoidosis, reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were reported during the study. 
A total of 10 adverse events (including 2 cases of psoriasis and one case of tuberculosis) leading to 
discontinuation possibly or probably related to study drug were reported in the adalimumab group. 
There were no serious infections reported during the DB period. Three subjects reported serious 
infections during the OL period of the study; 1 subject in the PBO/ADA treatment group (postoperative 
wound infection) and 2 subjects in the ADA/ADA treatment group (sinusitis and tuberculosis). The 
subject in the ADA/ADA treatment group during the OL period of the study who experienced a serious 
infection of TB was discontinued from the study. The risk of primary as well as reactivated TB is well 
known and addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The risk of TB occurring in patients receiving 
adalimumab therapy is already included in the Humira RMP as an important identified risk. In addition 
to routine Pharmacovigilance measures (which includes the use of specialized questionnaires to identify 
the results of screening, medical history and administration of TB prophylaxis therapy), the risk of TB 
is managed via additional minimization tools that educate prescribers on relevant precautions and 
special safety concerns in order to help prevent the reactivation of TB under adalimumab treatment. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that the current RMP adequately addresses risks associated with TB 
Assessment report  
Page 38/43
 
 
 
 
 
 
infection. No new activities in addition to those already being performed are needed to monitor this 
risk. 
Two cases of new onset of psoriasis emerged. Both required discontinuation of the study drug. It may 
be suspected that the targeted population may run a greater risk to develop psoriasis triggered by 
adalimumab treatment than others, given the fact that psoriasis is one of the features of the 
spondyloarthritides and there is a higher risk that an individual belonging to this population have a 
predisposition to develop this disease than the average individual. New onset or worsening of psoriasis 
is labelled in the SmPC for Humira. It is also addressed in the RMP as in important identified risk. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers that the current RMP adequately addresses this risk. No new activities 
in addition to those already being performed are needed to monitor this risk. 
No serious allergic reactions were reported during the study. Two subjects, 1 each in the placebo and 
adalimumab treatment groups, reported allergic reactions (urticaria and eyelid edema). Allergic 
reaction is already addressed in the SmPC. It is also addressed in the RMP as in important identified 
risk. No new activities in addition to those already in place are needed to monitor this risk. 
During the study, 8.9% of subjects who received adalimumab reported injection site reactions 
(including injection site erythema). Injection site reaction is a known and common event with 
adalimumab administration and is addressed in the SmPC and RMP. It continues to constitute the most 
frequently reported event, although most of these events are mild to moderate in severity and 
transient in nature. No new activities beyond those already in place are needed to monitor this risk at 
this time. 
Additional data up to Week 68 became available during the procedure. As of Week 68 of the open-label 
period of the study, the rates of AEs for patients who had at least 1 dose of adalimumab (Any 
Adalimumab Safety Set) were generally consistent with AE rates observed during the double-blind 
period and in clinical trials of adalimumab for other disease indications. There was no indication that 
increased duration of exposure results in an increased rate of AEs. Safety data presented for the target 
nr-axSpA population who either has a positive MRI or elevated CRP at baseline are consistent with 
those observed for the entire study population. 
1.2.3.2 Conclusion on clinical safety  
Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during each phase of the study. The most common AE was 
non serious infections, such as nasopharyngitis. No new safety signal has been identified in the Axial 
SpA clinical development program submitted. The AE pattern in this study does not differ from the 
known safety profile of adalimumab. Adalimumab has a well characterised safety profile in several 
authorised indications, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Data submitted 
in this application confirm the known safety profile observed with the approved indications. Overall, the 
safety profile of adalimumab in the treatment of nr-axSpA appears to be similar with the one known 
for other approved indications. 
In the study M10-791, AEs of special interest for adalimumab have been monitored and no safety 
signal has been detected. Safety data were also presented for the target nr-axSpA population for 
adalimumab therapy who either has a positive MRI or elevated CRP at baseline, and the results are 
consistent with those observed for the entire study population. Further data will become available to 
further characterise the long term safety of adalimumab in axial SpA patients as soon as the 3-year 
study is completed.

2. Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The submission is based on a single pivotal Phase 3 study, Study M10-791, in about 192 adult subjects 
with non-AS axial SpA randomized to adalimumab 40mg eow or matching placebo for 12 weeks. 
Thereafter, all received open label adalimumab. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients 
achieving an ASAS40 response at Week 12. The Week 12 (end of DB period) analysis showed that a 
statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab treatment group achieved 
ASAS40 responses compared with placebo. Similar results were observed using the PPP (35.9% versus 
14.1%, P = 0.002). Significant effects were also demonstrated at week 12 for all ranked secondary 
efficacy endpoints, including two MRI endpoints (SPARCC MRI score sacroiliac joints, and for the spine, 
p=0.003 and 0.001, respectively). In addition a number of “supportive secondary endpoints” were 
assessed with an overall pattern of results favoring active treatment. This is overall considered a 
robust effect, and of clinical relevance in terms of symptomatic treatment. 
Assessment report  
Page 40/43
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the data available so far from the ongoing study, a clinical benefit of adalimumab treatment 
was observed for all endpoints throughout the 12-52 week period. Additional data up to 68 weeks 
showed that the observed clinical response rates at Week 12 were sustained up to Week 68. The 
duration of Study M10-791 is 3 years. As described in the RMP the MAH will submit the final CSR of 
Study M10-791 by Q4 2013 which will bring additional data supportive of beneficial long term effect of 
adalimumab treatment of nr-axSpA patients. 
During the procedure the CHMP questioned the reliability, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of 
the ASAS classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis to define a subgroup with early axial 
spondylarthritis who could benefit the most from adalimumab treatment. The problem of delayed AS 
diagnosis was acknowledged by the CHMP. It is recognized that there are currently patients who do not 
have radiographic signs of the disease; but who do not respond adequately to NSAIDs and thereby are 
in need of an alternative treatment option. Nevertheless, there is a potential to treat patients who have 
no inflammatory back pain as the diagnosis of nr-axSpA, applying these criteria, does not require the 
presence of active inflammation as detected by MRI. In response to this concern, and as the data 
presented showed that patients with evidence of either inflammation on MRI of either the spine or SI 
joints, or an elevated CRP, achieve better clinical responses to adalimumab, the MAH proposed to 
require the presence of an elevated CRP or a positive MRI in the target population in addition to having 
severe active disease despite treatment with NSAIDs. The CHMP agreed with this measure as it allows 
reducing considerably the possibility of treating patients with non inflammatory disease and thereby 
identifies a population in whom the benefit/risk balance is positive. For clarification the CHMP required 
a change to the wording requiring the presence of an elevated CRP and/or a positive MRI in the target 
population to make clear that patients displaying both signs of inflammation are also covered in the 
indication. This was accepted by the MAH. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
To further study the need for continuous anti-TNF therapy for nr-axSpA patients to maintain clinical 
response or remission over time, the MAH committed to conduct a post approval randomized controlled 
remission-withdrawal-retreatment study in nr-axSpA subjects which is endorsed by the CHMP. The 
results of such a study will provide more information on whether it is possible to discontinue treatment 
in subjects in whom there is no disease activity following treatment for 24 weeks; what proportion of 
patients treated early in their disease achieve remission and also on the safety and efficacy of re-
treatment after disease flare. The MAH will provide the results of this study by Q3 2015 as described in 
the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The AE pattern in the study supporting this application does not differ from the established safety 
profile of adalimumab. There were no new safety concerns identified. Adalimumab was generally well 
tolerated during each phase of the study and the most common AE was non serious infections, such as 
nasopharyngitis.  
Adalimumab has a well characterised safety profile in several authorised indications, including AS or 
PsA. Data submitted in this application confirm the known safety profile observed with the approved 
indications. Overall, the safety profile of adalimumab in the treatment of nr-axSpA appears to be 
similar with the one known for other approved indications.

In general, treatment with adalimumab is connected with several more serious risks i.e. serious 
infections, risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, malignancies or demyelination event. These serious 
risks have not been observed in study M10-791. As described in the RMP, these risks are monitored 
through extensive ongoing follow up programs (including registries) in rheumatologic diseases with 
focus on RA; in which long term safety data is collected and reported annually for several years. 
Additional data up to Week 68 in study M10-791 showed that the rates of AEs for patients were 
generally consistent with AE rates observed in clinical trials of adalimumab for other indications. As 
described in the RMP the MAH will submit the final CSR of Study M10-791 by Q4 2013 which will bring 
additional data on the long term safety of adalimumab treatment of nr-axSpA patients. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For AS patients who continue to have active disease despite NSAIDs, adalimumab is an approved 
therapy. However, nr-axSpA patients, who may have the same signs, symptoms and level of disease 
activity as AS patients, currently have no treatment alternative to NSAIDs. Traditional disease 
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SSZ) have 
not been shown to be effective for axial SpA. Patients with nr-axSpA suffer from signs and symptoms 
that can have a significant impact on their day to day and/or work-related activities, and therefore 
require effective therapies. It is acknowledged that there is a group of patients with an inflammatory 
spinal disease that have not yet led to changes detectable by x-ray, but who still suffer from the same 
symptoms as those AS patients who have radiologic changes, and who are in need of a therapeutic 
option when NSAID treatment does not have an adequate effect. Results from study M10-791 showed 
that treatment with adalimumab 40 mg sc eow conferred a significant clinical benefit to patients with 
nr-axSpA. These data are considered valuable and of clinical relevance. 
The safety profile of adalimumab is well established. Treatment with adalimumab is connected with 
several potentially serious risks. In Study M10-791 the most common AE was non serious infections, 
such as nasopharyngitis. No new safety signal has been identified in the Axial SpA clinical development 
program submitted. The safety profile of adalimumab in the treatment of Axial SpA appears to be 
similar with the one known for other approved indications. 
Benefit-risk balance  
The applicant has shown that adalimumab has a robust effect in the studied nr-axSpA patient 
population and this is of clinical relevance in terms of symptomatic treatment. The safety profile of 
adalimumab in the studied population does not differ from the established safety profile of adalimumab 
in other approved indications. Study M10-791 demonstrated that there is a greater likelihood of clinical 
response among patients with either elevated CRP or positive MRI, with no differences in safety 
compared to the overall study population. Therefore, nr-axSpA patients who are candidates for 
adalimumab treatment must have severe active disease, inadequate response to, intolerance to, or 
contraindication for, NSAIDs, and evidence of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI. Requiring an 
objective measure of inflammation reduces the potential to treat patients with no inflammatory back 
pain and thereby allows identifying a population in whom the benefit-risk balance is positive. In 
addition, long-term efficacy and safety in subjects with up to 68 weeks of adalimumab treatment 
further support a positive benefit-risk profile for adalimumab in this population.  
In conclusion, based on the available efficacy and safety data presented, the benefit risk balance of 
adalimumab is considered positive for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis 
without radiographic evidence of AS, but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or

MRI, who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs. 
3. Conclusion 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore does recommend, by consensus, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6 Change(s) to 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
II 
therapeutic indication(s) 
an approved one. 
Extension of indication for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of AS, but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, who 
have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated accordingly as well as the package 
leaflet and Annex II.

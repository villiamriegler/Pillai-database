2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Bosutinib was granted conditional approval in the European Union (EU) on 27 March 2013 for the 
treatment of adult patients with CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML previously treated with 1 or more TKIs and for 
whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options.  
The current regulatory submission is being made in support of an additional indication for bosutinib to 
include the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CP CML. 
Bosutinib was designated as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of chronic myeloid 
leukemia on 4 August 2010. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Bosulif (bosutinib) is proposed for the treatment for adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic phase (CP) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CML accounts for 20% of adult leukemias (Union for International Cancer Control, 2014). The number 
of new cases of CML has been estimated as 1.8 per 100,000 men and women per year in the United 
States (US) (SEER Cancer Stat Facts, CML) and 1.2 per 100,000 men and women per year in the UK 
(Cancer Research UK CML Statistics). CML can occur in all age groups but occurs predominantly among 
adults and more frequently among males than females (Union for International Cancer Control, 2014). 
The median age at diagnosis is approximately 65 years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a reciprocal t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation that 
results in the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome containing the p210 BCR-ABL1 (hereafter 
referred to as BCR-ABL) oncogene (Chereda, 2015). The BCR-ABL oncogene encodes the BCR-ABL 
kinase that activates several downstream signaling pathways, which mediate myeloproliferation, 
resistance to apoptosis, and genetic instability. 
The BCR-ABL gene fusion translocation is observed in all cases of CML, and detection of the gene 
together with identification of the Ph chromosome by karyotyping is used to confirm the diagnosis of 
CML (Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2006). In most patients with CML, BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts are 
characterized by b2a2 and/or b3a2 junctions (Faderl et al, 1999). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/187737/2018  
Page 7/93 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
CML comprises 3 distinct phases, which are differentiated by clinical characteristics and laboratory 
findings: a Chronic Phase (CP), an accelerated phase (AP), and a blast phase (BP). CML is usually 
diagnosed in the CP (Chereda, 2015; Quintas-Cardama & Cortes, 2006;Faderl et al, 1999). 
Patients may present with fatigue, anemia, splenomegaly, abdominal discomfort, or infections, but 
often are asymptomatic, with diagnosis occurring after evaluation of routine blood work for an 
unrelated medical reason. Untreated CML commonly progresses within 3 to 5 years to blast crisis (BC), 
also termed BP, usually preceded by AP. Disease progression is characterized by a progressive loss of 
white blood cell (WBC) differentiation and is defined by a blast cell count of 15-29% (peripheral blood) 
in AP and ≥ 30% (blood and/or marrow) in BP (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] 
2017). BP CML, which resembles acute leukemia, generally leads to patient death due to infection, 
thrombosis, or anemia. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has changed the CML treatment landscape 
dramatically. Their use has resulted in a marked decrease in the transformation of CP CML to more 
advanced, lethal phases of CML (Druker et al, 2006) and has improved life expectancy for patients 
with CML so that it is comparable with the general population (Flynn & Atallah, 2016). The goal of 
treatment has changed from focusing on delaying disease progression to prolonging life while 
maintaining as normal a quality of life as possible. 
Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) was the first TKI to be approved for adult and paediatric patients with 
newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) CML for whom bone marrow 
transplantation is not considered as the first line of treatment in the European Union (EU) in 2006.  
Other TKIs against the kinase domain of BCR-ABL have been developed as second-generation 
(dasatinib and nilotinib) and third-generation (ponatinib) TKIs for the treatment of CP CML. In the EU, 
dasatinib was approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed (Ph+) CML in the 
chronic phase in 2010 and nilotinib was approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed (Ph+) CML in the chronic phase in 2010. 
About the product 
Bosutinib belongs to a pharmacological class of medicinal products known as kinase inhibitors. 
Bosutinib inhibits the abnormal BCR ABL kinase that promotes CML. Modeling studies indicate that 
bosutinib binds the kinase domain of BCR ABL. Bosutinib is also an inhibitor of Src family kinases 
including Src, Lyn and Hck. Bosutinib minimally inhibits platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor 
and c Kit (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Bosulif has been authorised in 2013 for treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated 
phase, and blast phase  Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) 
previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and 
dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/187737/2018  
Page 8/93 
 
 
 
 
Bosulif  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with:  newly  -diagnosed  chronic  phase  (CP) 
Philadelphia chromosome -positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Ph+ CML) (SmPC, section 4.1). 
The CHMP adopted this indication without changes. 
The recommended dose for the newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML is 400 mg bosutinib once daily (SmPC, 
section 4.2). 
Two phase 3 studies have been conducted in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CP CML: pivotal Study 
AV001 and supportive Study B1871008 (Study 1008). Supportive Study 1008 was conducted prior to 
the  start of  pivotal  Study  AV001  and  provided  the  basis  for  the  design  of  Study  AV001. Both  studies 
support the extension of indication application. 
In addition, the MAH submitted an updated SmPC with safety and efficacy date from studies B1871006 
and B1871008.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
In support of the development of bosutinib for the treatment of adults patients with newly diagnosed 
Ph+ CP CML with an oral dose of 400 mg daily, additional pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluations 
have been completed. The new pharmacokinetics information includes: systemic exposure to bosutinib 
and its metabolites in the carcinogenicity study in rats, toxicokinetics of bosutinib in juvenile rats, and 
in vitro evaluation of the potential for bosutinib to inhibit various drug transporters. The new toxicology 
information includes: a juvenile toxicity study in rats, a local vascular irritation study in rabbits, in vitro 
studies of the blood compatibility of IV formulation in rabbit and human blood, and the revision of the 
comparison of exposures achieved in animals with those in humans to reflect the planned human 
clinical dose of 400 mg daily.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No pharmacology studies were conducted. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
For  the  toxicokinetic  evaluation  in  juvenile  rats  (131468VSMB_PGC_R1)  the  former  validated  and 
assessed  LC/MS/MS  method  for  the  quantification  of  bosutinib  a  revised  LC-MS/MS  assay  validation 
was conducted for the determination of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic parameters in plasma of the 
juvenile  rats.  For  this  method,  using  0.5  mL  rat  plasma  volume,  the  assay  was  linear  from  1  to  500 
ng/mL  instead  of  5  ng/mL  to  500  ng/mL  (rat  and  dog)  respectively  10  ng/mL  to  500  ng/mL  (mouse 
and rabbit) in the former assay. 
In vitro Transporter Inhibition by PF-05208763 (Study PF-05208763) 
The purpose of this study was to determine the inhibitory potency of Bosulif (PF-05208763) for human 
breast  cancer  resistance  protein  (BCRP),  human  organic  anion  transporter  (OAT)  1  and  3,  human 
hepatic  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptides  (OATP)  1B1  and  1B3,  and  human  organic  cation 
transporter (OCT) 1 and 2 when stably expressed in a mammalian cellular system. 
The following stably transfected cell lines and their corresponding probes were used for analysis:

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
An Oral (Gavage) Toxicity Study of PF-05208763 in Juvenile Rats (Study Number WIL-655073; 
Sponsor Number 13GR351) 
A juvenile toxicity study (GLP-compliant) was conducted in rats to evaluate the effects of 3, 10, 30, 
and 75 mg/kg/day bosutinib administered by oral gavage from postnatal day (PND) 7 to PND28. 
Bosutinib was not tolerated at ≥10 mg/kg, with severe body weight loss and mortality leading to 
termination of these dose groups between PND14 and PND21 (just prior to weaning). No adverse 
findings were observed in the 3 mg/kg dose group resulting in a no-observable-adverse effect- level 
(NOAEL). Cmax exposure was 1,160 ng/mL and AUC24 exposure was 20,100 ng h/mL.

Exposures on PND7 were greater than expected based on exposures obtained in adult rats at similar 
doses on a mg/kg basis in prior studies. This is attributed to the limited liver metabolic capability in 
pre-weaning rats. The exposures on PND7 at 10 mg/kg were 275x (male) and 56x (female) the 
exposure in more mature rats at the same dose on a mg/kg basis. Plasma concentrations on PND17 
and PND18 indicate these high exposures were maintained through at least the first 10 days of the 
study. Post-weaning exposures on PND28 in the 3 mg/kg dose group were subtherapeutic.  
Local Vascular Irritation Study of bosutinib(PF-05208763) in New Zealand White Rabbits (Study 
14LJ062) 
The purpose of this non-GLP study was to investigate the local tolerance of bosutinib following single 
intravenous infusion or perivascular injection in rabbits. Male New Zealand White rabbits (4/group) 
were administered bosutinib, vehicle (, or 0.9% saline by intravenous infusion and perivascular 
injection). 
Doses  were  given  by  intravenous  infusion  (caudal  left  marginal  ear  vein)  and  perivascular  injection 
(rostral portion of the right ear) to each animal once on Day 1. The dose volumes for intravenous and 
perivascular  administration  were  constant  at  80  mL  and  0.05  mL,  respectively.  Due  to  the  large 
volume of total drug required, intravenous doses were delivered as an infusion via indwelling catheter 
over 2-3 hours at a rate of 20 mL/kg/h using an infusion pump. Flow rates were calculated using the 
lowest  animal  body  weight.  Observations  and  measurements  were  collected  from  day1  until  day  4. 
Clinical signs of irritation were evaluated as follows: Day 1: prior to dosing, immediately following, and 
1  and  3-4  hours  following  dosing,  Days  2-3:  twice  daily,  Day  4:  prior  to  termination.  Tissues  were 
collected on day 4 only. 
Dose  administration  sites  were  monitored  for  the  following  endpoints:  redness,  swelling,  thickening, 
discoloration, exudation, and sore development. Each endpoint was scored on a scale of 0-4 (0 =  no 
finding; 1 = minimal; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe finding. 
Following  intravenous  infusion,  minimal  swelling  observed  in  2/4  bosutinib-treated  animals  was 
considered  test  article-related  because  it  was  not  observed  in  either  the  saline  or  vehicle-treated 
groups.  Minimal  thickening  observed  in  1/4  rabbits  correlated  with  microscopic  findings  of  dermal 
fibrosis and was also considered test-article related. 
Following  perivascular  injection,  minimal  thickening  and  minimal  fibrinoid  necrosis  of  a  vessel  wall, 
each in 1/4 bosutinib-treated animals, were considered test article-related as they were not observed 
in  either  the  saline  or  vehicle-treated  groups.  Increased  incidence  and/or  severity  of  dermal 
hemorrhage,  dermal  fibrin/edema  and  dermal  fibrosis  were  attributed  to  vehicle  and/or  bosutinib. 
Dermal hemorrhage findings across all groups correlated with irritation scores of discoloration. 
Two-Year Oral (Gavage) Carcinogenicity Study in rats (Study RPT-80077) 
A  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  was  conducted  in  S-D  rats  (60/sex/group).  Rats  were  gavaged  once 
daily with 0 (distilled water), 0 (vehicle), 0 (vehicle), and males with 2.5, 7.5, or 25 mg/kg bosutinib 
for  up  to  91  weeks  and  females  with  1.5,  5,  or  15  mg/kg  bosutinib  for  up  to  100  weeks.  Based  on 
reduced survival in males at 25 mg/kg/day bosutinib, the dose level was decreased to 15 mg/kg/day 
on  Week  78.  Vehicle  was a  mixture of  0.5%  methylcellulose  (4000  cps)  (w/v),  2.0% polysorbate  80, 
NF (w/v), 0.06% glacial acetic acid, NF (w/v) and distilled water. 
Plasma toxicokinetics of bosutinib and its metabolites M2 and M5 were evaluated in satellite groups on 
days 182-183 with mean exposures (AUC(0-24) bosutinib) of 14.9, 51, and 313 ng hr/mL in males at 
2.5,  7.5,  and  25  mg/kg/day,  and  18.2,  116,  and  645  ng  hr/mL  in  females.  Exposure  levels  were 
equivalent to 0.1, 0.3, and 1.8-fold the unbound AUC in humans for males and 0.1, 0.7, and 3.8-fold

for  females  following  the 400  mg  dose.  The  exposures  to  the  M5  metabolite in  males  and  females  at 
the  highest  dose tested  (unbound  AUC(0-24)  of 94 and  15.3  ng• hr/mL,  respectively)  were  2.7x  and 
0.4x  the  predicted  M5  unbound  AUC  in  humans  following  the  400  mg  dose.  The  exposure  to  the  M2 
metabolite  in  males  (total  AUC(0-24)  of  175  ng∙hr/mL;  unbound  fraction  not  available  for  M2)  was 
0.3x the predicted M2 total AUC in humans following the 400 mg dose, while negligible exposures were 
measured in female rats. 
In  high  dose  males  (25/15  mg/kg/day)  survival  was  significant  lower  compared  to  control  groups. 
Dosing  for  this  group  was  stopped  on  Week  79  when  the  surviving  animals  were  reduced  to  20. 
Surviving  males  in  this  group  were  euthanized  on  Week  86.  Remaining  groups  of  males  were 
euthanized  on  Weeks  90-91.  Reduced  survival  in  female  high  dose  group  resulted  in  cessation  of 
dosing  in  Week  92.  All  female  groups  were  euthanized  in  weeks  97-100.  In  females,  there  were  no 
statistically  significant  differences  at  termination  in  survival  in  treated  groups  versus  controls. 
Decreases  in  absolute  body  weight  and  body  weight  gain  were  observed  in  high  dose  males  (25/15 
mg/kg/day)  and  females  (15  mg/kg/day).  Statistically  significant  decreases  were  evident  beginning 
Week 6 in males and Week 53 in females. Decreased body weight and bodyweight gains in high dose 
groups correlated with decreased food consumption. 
Main  non-neoplastic  findings  were  erosions/ulceration  and  inflammation/edema/hemorrhage  in  the 
forestomach 
of 
high 
dose 
females 
(15 
mg/kg/day), 
mucosal 
congestion/hemorrhage/erosions/ulceration  and  mucosal  necrosis  in  the  small  and  large  intestine  of 
mid and high dose males and females and collagen deposition in lamina propria at all treated groups. 
Chronic progressive nephropathy was observed in mid and high dose males and tubular atrophy in the 
kidney  of  high  dose  males  and  females.  Epithelial  hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis  of  the  squamous 
epithelium of the forestomach was seen in mid and high dose males and high dose females. Lymphatic 
vessel  proliferation,  ectasia  and  fibrosis  in  the  mesenteric  lymph  nodes  were  observed  in  all  dosed 
males and mid and high dose females. Multifocal lobular atrophy with inflammation and fibrosis in the 
exocrine pancreas in mid and high dose males and high dose females were also seen as well as  sinus 
erythroctosis/erythrophagocytosis  of  the  mesenteric  lymph  nodes  in  all  treated  male  groups  and  mid 
and high dose females. 
Based  effects  seen  at  all  dose  levels  in  this  study  no  NOAEL  for  nonneoplastic  findings  was  derived. 
There were no neoplastic findings resulting from administration of bosutinib at dose levels up to 25/15 
mg/kg/day (males) and 15 mg/kg/day (females) for up to 2 years. 
In Vitro Comparability of the IV Formulation of bosutinib (PF-05208763) with Rabbit Blood (Study 
Number 14LJ047) 
The hemolytic potential of 0.5 mg/mL bosutinib (two different IV formulations) and its vehicle () were 
evaluated with rabbit blood using the modified Dacie method of erythrocyte fragility. Both test 
formulation containing 0.5 mg/mL of bosutinib and its vehicle caused toxicologically significant 
hemolysis in vitro (see Table 4).

In Vitro Comparability of the IV Formulation of PF-05208763 with Human Blood (Study Number 
14LJ048) 
The hemolytic potential of 0.5 mg/mL of bosutinib IV formulation and its vehicle [] were evaluated with 
human blood using the Reed and Yalkowsky method. Formulation containing 0.5 mg/mL of bosutinib 
did not cause significant hemolysis at [I:4], [I :6], [I:10] and [1:20]. In a similar manner, vehicle did 
not cause significant hemolysis at [I:6], [I:10] and [I:20]. However, 2% hemolysis was observed with 
the Vehicle at [I:4] which is considered negligible. No precipitation was observed with bosutinib (PF-
05208763) IV formulation and the vehicle in all the dilutions tested.

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In order to develop potential DDI of bosutinib, the inhibitory potency of bosutinib for human breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP), human organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and 3, human hepatic

organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, and human organic cation transporter 
(OCT) 1 and 2 was evaluated according to the EMA Guidance and at the clinically relevant 
concentrations of 400 and 500 mg QD. The data indicated that bosutinib has the potential to inhibit 
BCRP in the GI-tract but showed a low systemic DDI. The potential of bosutinib to cause DDI by 
inhibiting OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 is considered to be low. The analysis of the potential to inhibit OCT1 
was not performed according to the EMA Guidance. According to the EMA guidelines there is the 
possibility that bosutinib has the potential to inhibit OCT1. 
In conclusion the in vitro studies indicated that bosutinib has a low potential to inhibit breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP, systemically), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, 
organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2 at clinically relevant 
concentrations, but may have the potential to inhibit BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract and OCT1 
(SmPC section 4.5). 
The analysis of TK data in the newly performed juvenile rat study showed greater exposures on PND7 
than expected based on exposures in adult rats at similar doses in prior studies. It is not expected that 
these findings are of clinical relevance because of the possible immature metabolic pathway of 
bosutinib in the juvenile rats. Furthermore, the high exposures observed in PND7 rats do not translate 
into the clinical setting since the known metabolic pathway for bosutinib is fully mature by one year of 
age in humans (Lacroix et al, 1997; Stevens et al, 2003). 
A pre- and postnatal development rat study will be completed post approval of bosutinib in first-line 
therapy. The MAH will submit the results of the study as soon as they become available (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
The local tolerance study in rabbits showed that perivascular injection was less tolerated compared to 
intravenous injection.  
Data of the 2-year carcinogenicity study have already be performed and assessed during the original 
submission of Bosulif in 2012. Since the posology the new application is intended with an oral dose of 
400 mg daily instead of 500 mg of the original indication, this study was reassessed for underlining the 
dose of 400 mg. No relevant treatment related increases in neoplastic lesion were observed. 
A 6-month transgenic rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study will be completed post approval of bosutinib 
for first line therapy. The MAH will submit the results of the study as soon as they become available 
(see Risk Management Plan). 
The hemolytic potential of bosulif was evaluated in two in vitro studies. These comparability studies 
showed that bosutinb lead to toxicologically significant hemolysis in vitro in rabbit blood but showed no 
toxicologically relevant hemolysis in vitro in human blood. Therefore, it is unlikely that bosulif will 
cause hemolysis in vivo in human blood. 
The active substance bosutinib is not expected to pose a risk to surface water, groundwater, sediment 
and soil compartments. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies evaluated so far support the proposed new indication from 
a non-clinical point of view.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This submission included bosutinib PK data for 267 patients with newly diagnosed CP CML (Ph+ and 
Philadelphia chromosome negative [Ph-]) in Study AV001 based on a data cutoff date of 11 August 
2016. 
An updated population PK analysis was conducted based on 4 studies (Study 1006, 1008, 1012, and 
Study AV001). In addition, an exposure-response analysis of key safety and efficacy endpoints was 
conducted based on 2 Phase 3 first-line studies in adult CML patients (Study 1008 and Study AV001). 
Methods 
A method (Report TRTPR14-036) was validated for measuring bosutinib in human plasma (K3EDTA) in 
study AV001. Samples were analysed using a 100 μL aliquot volume and a liquid/liquid extraction 
procedure followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Bosutinib 
concentrations were calculated with a 1/x2 linear regression over a concentration range of 
1.00-200 ng/mL using bosutinib-d8 as an internal standard. An API 4000 was operated in the Multiple 
Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode under optimized conditions for detection of bosutinib and bosutinib-
d8 positive ions formed by electrospray ionization. The method met the acceptance criteria as specified 
in SOP LABOP105 (Table 8).

The experimentally determined recovery of the analyte, bosutinib, was approximately 68-76% across 
the low, mid, and high QC levels, while the recovery determined for the isotopically labelled internal 
standard was around 100%. Since the chemical nature of both compounds is similar, recovery of both

would be expected also to be similar. The raw documentation for this experiment was reviewed, but no 
error is apparent.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Study AV001 / Population modelling PMAR-EQDD-B187j 
In the phase III study AV0001 pharmacokinetic profiles of bosutinib were determined using sparse 
sampling and population PK analysis approach. 4 PK samples per patient were drawn. All patients in 
the bosutinib treatment group provided pre-dose blood samples on days 1, 28, 56 and 84. Per 
protocol, the PK samples were collected within 180 minutes before study drug administration. Samples 
taken at Day 1 were not used in the analysis as they were taken before any drug had been 
administered. 
The PK population in study AV001 included all subjects, regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status, 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had sufficient plasma results collected in order to 
create reliable PK parameter results. The PK population was used for all PK analyses (n=267). 
Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables were summarized by descriptive statistics (sample 
size [n], mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum and 95% confidence interval). 
Categorical variables were summarized in frequency tables (n, frequencies, and percentages). 
In addition, the concentration of study drug was analysed using population PK methodology. 
Population mean values of PK parameters (e.g., clearance [CL/F], volume of distribution [V/F]) were 
estimated. PK relationships between plasma study drug concentration and selected outcome measures 
were characterized using a population approach. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population

A summary of trough bosutinib plasma levels over time is provided in Table 9. The median bosutinib 
trough concentration averaged over Days 28, 56, and 84 was 61.10 ng/mL (range: 0.50-453.00 
ng/mL).

Study AV001 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect – efficacy endpoints 
Median trough plasma bosutinib concentrations were higher at each time-point in subjects with MMR 
compared to those without MMR at 12 months. Plasma bosutinib concentrations were also higher at 
Day 56, Day 84, and overall in subjects with CCyR vs. without CCyR by 12 months. 
Figure 4 Trough bosutinib plasma concentrations (ng/mL)

b  by CCyR response 
Logistic regression was used to analyse the probability of achieving MMR at 12 months and CCyR by 12 
months for subjects in the PK Population. The Day 84 trough bosutinib concentration was associated 
with a probability of achieving CCyR by 12 months (2-sided p=0.006). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect – safety 
At Day 28, there was a difference in bosutinib concentration between subjects with (median 
concentration: 44.6 ng/mL) and without (median concentration: 59.7 ng/mL) Grade ≥3 
thrombocytopenia. There was also a difference in bosutinib concentration between subjects with 
(median concentration: 3.9 ng/mL) and without (median concentration: 59.4 ng/mL) Grade ≥3 
vomiting at Day 28; this is based on 3 subjects with Grade≥3 vomiting in the PK Population. Logistic 
regression was used to analyse the probability of experiencing specific AEs for subjects in the PK 
Population. The Day 56 trough bosutinib concentration was associated with a probability of rash (2-
sided p=0.031) and nausea (2-sided p<0.001) AEs. 
Relationship between efficacy and safety 
The probability to experience specific ADRs was separately analysed for MMR and CCyR responders.

2.3.1.  PK/PD modelling 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect –efficacy endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints were MMR, CCyR, and CHR. Efficacy endpoint MMR was assessed at 48 weeks. 
If patients discontinued bosutinib treatment before the 48 weeks assessment, they were counted as a 
non-responder (-). For efficacy endpoints CCyR and CHR, the assessment was cumulative, ie, any on-
treatment response (+) was counted as a response if it occurred by 48 weeks. For the E-R analysis, 
each patient was required to have an estimated parameter of bosutinib exposure. A total of 512 
patients were included in the E-R analysis of MMR and CHR. For endpoint CCyR, the E-R analysis was 
conducted in Ph+ patients only (N=493). 
Table 13 Patients included in the model efficacy analysis  
Exploratory plots of the bosutinib exposures ( 
Figure 9) suggest E-R relationship between the efficacy endpoints of interest for this analysis and 
bosutinib exposures. 
Figure 9 Efficacy endpoints vs bosutinib exposures prior to event (Cavg, Ctrough, cAUC) 
Both time on treatment and bosutinib exposure were statistically significant predictors of the 
probability of achieving MMR at 48 weeks. However, time on treatment appears to play a bigger role 
than bosutinib exposure. A longer time on treatment leads to a higher probability of achieving MMR at

48 weeks. 
Bosutinib exposure is a statistically significant predictor of the probability of achieving CCyR and CHR 
by 48 weeks. The predicted probability curves are close to plateau (Figure 11) at the exposure 
expected from a daily dose of 400 mg, which suggests that differences in doses (400 mg versus 500 
mg once daily) will likely not translate into a clinically relevant difference in CCyR and CHR by 48 
weeks.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect –safety 
The  E-R  for  safety  was  performed  in  newly  diagnosed  CP  CML  patients  from  Studies  B1871008  and 
AV001.  Only  the  first  occurrence  of  the  highest  observed  AE  grade  in  the  first  year  of  bosutinib 
treatment (366 days) for each patient was used for the analysis. 
An  E-R  relationship  was  identified  for  AE  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting  with  time  to  event.  In  the 
final  model,  time  to  event  and  log(Cavg),  Ctrough,  and  Cavg  were  found  to  be  statistically  significant 
predictors  (p<0.05)  for  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting,  respectively.  No  demographic  covariates

were found to be statistically significant on any of these safety endpoints. 
The  predicted  probabilities  of  patients  experiencing  diarrhoea  and  nausea  Grade>0  are  shown  in 
Figure 12. The plots show that patients have a lower probability of moving from one AE grade to the 
subsequent higher AE grade as time goes on; however the probability of moving from one AE grade to 
the subsequent higher one earlier in treatment (one week) is higher as bosutinib exposure increases.

2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK population in the pivotal phase III study AV001 included all subjects, regardless of Philadelphia 
chromosome status, who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had sufficient plasma 
results collected in order to create reliable PK parameter results. The PK population was used for all PK 
analyses (n=267).

In study AV001 the average geo-mean bosutinib trough concentration was 59.4 ng/mL, as calculated 
from sparse blood sampling and was in the same range as the estimates in the submitted new 
population pharmacokinetic model estimations. The bosutinib trough concentrations suggest 
differences between e.g. age groups and groups of creatinine clearance which became more 
pronounced the longer the patients were on treatment. 
An updated popPK model for bosutinib was built on a pooled dataset based on the previous model 
assumptions (PMAR-219, submitted with initial MAA dossier) and, specifically, on studies B1871006, 
B1871008, B1871012 and AV001 under the assumption that the PK of bosutinib would not change 
between patients treated with first-line or second-line bosutinib therapy. This assumption is 
acceptable. The MAH was asked for an explanation of the apparent approx. 20-fold higher median AUC 
estimates in the new model and it was clarified that in the new model AUCτ had been reported over a 
28-day interval. The newly estimated geo-mean values for AUCτ on Day 140 are ~2.4 and 3.2 
µg*hr/mL for the 400 mg and 500 mg dose levels, respectively, which are in the same range as those 
previously reported and stated in the SmPC. 
For renal impairment, the previous model was already updated once by inclusion of data from the renal 
impairment study B1871020 to be able to provide reliable dosing recommendations for renally 
impaired patients. These ‘Alldata’ model PK data resulted in the current approved dose adjustment 
recommendations for 500mg. The proposed new dose adjustment recommendations in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC for moderate and severe renally impaired patients in first line CML for the 400mg dose are 
considered sufficiently justified and hence acceptable.   
The modelling approach did not include a covariate analysis of the full dataset. A covariate analysis is 
considered necessary, in order to provide information on the potential for dose adjustments. The MAH 
is planning to develop a more comprehensive population PK model and further identify sources of 
variability, including the patient data from AV001. The MAH should investigate in the new model 
covariates that might have an influence on the plasma concentrations to improve dosing. In addition,  
the MAH should further address the following issue: The lines representing the median and percentiles 
for the observed data do not always follow the depicted observed data, e.g. at time points around 150 
to 200 h after first dose for the 500 mg dose plot, the data seem to be excluded from the analyses. 
Finally, confidence intervals for the observed data should be submitted. The MAH proposed to submit 
the population modelling analysis report by the fourth quarter of 2018. This is endorsed. 
Similar to what was revealed for first-line CML patients with 500mg during the initial MAA procedure, 
in study AV001 with 400mg responders had higher bosutinib trough plasma concentrations than non-
responders (at least 25% higher for responders) so that Ctrough was a predictor of CHR, CCyR and 
MMR. The deeper the response was (CHR < CCyR < MMR) the higher was Ctrough already after 28 
days. In addition for MMR, longer time on treatment predicted higher probability for response, though 
only predictable at 48 weeks from the underlying dataset. Derived from this model it seems more 
important to stay on treatment than to receive a higher dose. However, the potential to increase 
concentrations in patients not responding in order to improve therapy outcome should be evaluated 
and in this respect, the investigation of covariates in the popPK analyses could provide potential to 
improve dosing. But as the MAH committed to submit an updated popPK model in Q4/2018, this aspect 
will be further analysed therein. 
In addition, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated with new data from long-term treatment in 
studies 200-WW and 3000-WW concerning eGFR decline over time, which is overall acknowledged. 
A statistically significant and positive exposure-response relationship between bosutinib exposure and 
incidence of rash, elevated ALT, and elevated aspartate amino transferase (AST) (Grade >0) was 
Assessment report

observed. A statistically significant and inverse exposure-response relationship between bosutinib 
exposure and incidence of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (Grade>0) was observed.  
Lower bosutinib exposure is predicted to decrease the probability of AEs earlier on treatment for 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, and at any time on treatment for rash, elevated ALT, and AST. 
Comparing the 2 Phase 3 study results, 38 patients (14.2%) in Study AV001 (starting dose of 400 mg 
once daily) permanently discontinued treatment due to a AE compared to 52 patients (21.0%) who 
permanently discontinued treatment due to a AE in Study 1008 (starting dose of 500 mg once daily). 
The MMR at 48 weeks in Study AV001 was 47.2% versus 38.0% in Study 1008, suggesting that a 
lower dose did not compromise efficacy, but rather reduced the risk of permanent discontinuations due 
to AEs. These findings suggest that a lower starting dose of bosutinib may allow patients to remain on 
treatment longer, and that time on treatment plays a bigger role in efficacy than dose. 
Differences in bosutinib concentration between subjects with and without Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia 
and between subjects with and without Grade ≥ 3 vomiting at Day 28 were observed. Logistic 
regression was used to analyse the probability of experiencing specific AEs for subjects in the PK 
Population. The Day 56 trough bosutinib concentration was associated with a probability of rash and 
nausea AEs. 
The probability of experiencing certain ADRs (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, rash and 
thrombocytopenia) was separately analysed for ‘All patients’ vs. MMR responders vs. CCyR 
responders in study AV001. Except for diarrhoea ≥ grade 1, patients who were responders for MMR 
and CCyR experienced more ADRs independently of lower or higher bosutinib concentrations. 
Generally, the higher the trough plasma concentrations were, the higher was the probability of ADRs in 
all cases. 
A statistically significant and positive exposure-response relationship between bosutinib exposure and 
incidence of rash, elevated ALT, and elevated aspartate amino transferase (AST) was revealed. In 
contrast, significant statistical results suggest an inverse exposure-response relationship between 
bosutinib exposure and incidence of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (Grade>0). 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  relevant  changes  in  the  overall  bosutinib  clinical  pharmacology  profile  that  were  identified  based 
on the new PK and PD data submitted in this variation application have been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Prior  clinical  studies  with  bosutinib in  CML  used  a  starting  dose  of  bosutinib of  500  mg  daily,  both  in 
first-line (BELA/Study 1008-3000WW) and in later lines of treatment (Study 200WW). In both studies, 
a  considerable  number  of  subjects  reported  toxicities  which  were  managed  in  most  of  the  cases  by 
treatment interruption and/or dose reduction. 
In  first-line  CP  CML  patients  recruited  in  BELA/Study  3000,  a  total  of  92/250  (37%)  patients  treated 
with  bosutinib  had  a  dose  reduction  from  500  mg  to  400  mg  of  bosutinib/day  as  of  the  15  months’ 
follow-up.  The  median  time  to  first  dose  reduction  to  400  mg  was  53.5  days  with  a  range  from  2  to 
612 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/187737/2018  
Page 31/93 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of TEAEs overall as well as unique TEAEs were lower following dose reduction from 500 
mg to 400 mg. The overall incidence of Grade 3/4 TEAEs decreased from 88% to 71%. All of the most 
frequently reported TEAEs (all grades) also decreased: diarrhea (70% to 40%), ALT increased (39% to 
30%),  nausea  (38%  to  23%),  vomiting  (33%  to  24%),  AST  increased  (33%  to  23%),  and 
thrombocytopenia (30% to 21%). It is notable that the median time on treatment for patients prior to 
dose  reduction  was  53.5  days  (range:  2-612  days)  while  the  median  time  on  treatment  for  patients 
post dose reduction was 449 days (range: 0-1142 days).  
The efficacy of bosutinib in patients who received dose reductions to 400 mg remained favorable with 
46%  of  patients  achieving  a  CCyR  after  the  dose  reduction  to  400  mg  (compared  to  58%  in  the  ITT 
Population) and 16% of patients maintaining a previously attained CCyR. In addition, 40% of patients 
were able to achieve a MMR while on 400 mg of bosutinib (compared to 45% in the ITT Population). Of 
those dose reduced to 400 mg and who attained a CCyR and MMR, the majority of patients (68% and 
71%  respectively),  were  still  on  treatment  and  retaining  their  response  at  the  time  of  the  24-month 
follow-up analysis. 
The  starting  dose  of  imatinib  selected  in  this  study  (400  mg)  is  in  accordance  with  the  approved 
product label for CML patients.

Treatments 
The  starting  dose  for  all  subjects  was  400  mg  once  daily  of  either  bosutinib  or  imatinib,  orally, 
recommended to be taken in the morning with a meal and 200 mL of water. Patients were permitted to 
have their dose increased for suboptimal response to a maximum of 600 mg for bosutinib and 800 mg 
for  imatinib  or  reduced  due  to  toxicity  as  necessary  in  accordance  with  existing  CML  guidelines  (eg,

• 
Evaluate  patient-reported  outcomes  (PRO),  including  quality  of  life  (QoL),  using  Funtional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) and  EuroQoL:-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), in 
both treatment arms. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint was MMR defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by international scale 
(corresponding to ≥3 log reduction from standardized baseline) by RQ-PCR with at least 3,000 ABL 
transcripts analyzed by the central laboratory. 
In this study, a MMR at 12 months (48 weeks) was counted only if the response was demonstrated at 
the 12 month (48 week) visit; a MMR gained and lost before the 12 month (48 week) visit was deemed 
a nonresponse. 
Secondary endpoints  
•  Duration of MMR was defined as the time from the first date of MMR until the date of the loss of 
MMR or of progressive disease (earliest date in case of multiple events). Progressive disease was 
captured in the database as disease progression to AP/BP CML on the treatment discontinuation 
form.  
•  Duration of CCyR was defined as the time from the first date of CCyR until the date of the loss of 
CCyR or of progressive disease (or earliest date in case of multiple events).  
• 
EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of the earliest of the following 
events while on treatment: death due to any cause; transformation to AP or BP at any time on 
treatment; loss of CHR (defined as a hematologic assessment of non-CHR [CP, AP, or BP confirmed 
by 2 assessments at least 4 weeks apart);  loss of CCyR (defined as ≥1 Ph+ out of <100 
metaphases confirmed by a follow-up cytogenetic analysis >1 month later); for subjects not 
achieving a CHR: doubling of WBC count at least 1 month apart with the second value >20 x 109/L 
and maintained in subsequent assessments for at least 2 weeks; subjects without an event were 
censored at the last cytogenetic or hematologic assessment. 
•  OS, defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of death due to any cause. Subjects 
without death documented were censored at the last date on which they were known to be alive. 
Exploratory endpoints  
•  MMR at 3, 6, 9 and 18 months. 
•  MMR at 12 months in the Ph unrestricted (ie, Ph+ and Ph-) subject population. 
•  MR1 and MR2 at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. 
•  MR4 and MR4.5 at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. 
•  MR4 and MR4.5 (≥4 and ≥4.5 log reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts) were defined as a 4 and 
4.5 log reduction in the BCR-ABL from the standardized baseline or ≤0.01 and ≤0.0032 BCR-
ABL/ABL %, respectively, on the IS, measured by RQ-PCR. 
• 
Time to MMR (data collection not complete, but available results presented in this CSR) 
measured from randomization to the first date of MMR. Subjects without response were 
censored at the last molecular assessment. 
•  Cumulative confirmed CHR in both Ph+ and Ph unrestricted (ie, Ph+ and Ph-) subject 
population.

• 
Time to CCyR in both treatment arms (data collection not complete, but available results 
presented in this CSR) measured from randomization to the first date of CCyR (or MMR if MMR 
was achieved and no valid cytogenetic assessment was available). Subjects without response 
were censored at the last cytogenetic assessment. 
Time to on-treatment transformation to AP or BP measured from randomization to the first 
date of transformation. Subjects without transformation were censored at the last hematologic 
assessment. 
Presence of newly observed BCR-ABL mutations in subjects post-baseline andcorrelation with 
response to treatment in imatinib and bosutinib treatment arms. 
Sample size 
A total sample size of 500 Ph+ subjects harboring b2a2 and/or b3a2 transcripts was required for the 
study  to  provide  ≥90%  power  to  detect  at  least  15%  difference  (assuming  25%  in  the  imatinib  vs 
40% in the bosutinib arm) in the MMR rates at 12 months using a 1-sided alpha of 2.5% and figuring 
in  two  interim  futility  analyses  at  33%  of  patients  and  at  66%  of  subjects  with  adequate  follow-up. 
Early  stopping  was  intended  for  futility  only  (nonbinding,  O’Brien-Fleming  analog  beta  spending 
function). Nonbinding for the futility implied that the futility boundary would be constructed in such a 
way that it could be overruled if desired by the Sponsor and/or IDMC without inflating the type-1 error 
rate  and  without  decreasing  the  power.  Since  Ph  status  was  not  needed  for  randomization,  as  CML 
diagnosis was instead confirmed by presence of BCR-ABL transcript, Ph– was identified retrospectively 
after enrolment, a total of approximately 530 Ph+ and Ph- patients were expected to be randomized in 
1:1 ratio. 
Randomisation 
Upon completion of the screening evaluation and confirmation of eligibility, patients were randomly 
assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was done no more than 3 
business days prior to first dose of treatment. Randomization of patients into each arm were  
prospectively stratified based on the patient’s Sokal score at screening ( Low risk: Sokal score <0.8 vs 
Intermediate risk: Sokal score 0.8 to 1.2 vs High risk: Sokal score >1.2) and geographical region ( 
Region 1: United States, Canada, and Western Europe vs Region 2: Eastern Europe, Latin America and 
South Americava Region 3: Rest of World) in which the patient is enrolled.

Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) Population was the primary analysis population and was used for 
the  primary  efficacy  comparison.  The  mITT  Population  included  all  randomized  subjects  with  Ph+  CP 
CML  harboring  the  b2a2  and/or  b3a2  transcript  and  baseline  BCR-ABL  copies  >0  with  study  drug 
assignment designated according to initial randomization. All efficacy analyses were based on the mITT 
Population,  with  the  exception  of  the  duration  of  response  (based  on  responders)  and  selected 
secondary/exploratory endpoints.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/187737/2018  
Page 36/93 
 
 
 
 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population included all randomized subjects (ie, Ph+ and Ph) with study drug 
assignments  designated  according  to  initial  randomization.  The  ITT  Population  was  only  used  for 
additional  selected  secondary  efficacy  analyses  of  time  to  event  (OS)  and  additional  selected 
exploratory efficacy analyses.  
The  Safety  Population  included  all  subjects,  regardless  of  Ph  status,  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
study  medication  with  treatment  assignments  designated  to  actual  study  treatment  received.  The 
Safety Population was the population used for all safety analyses.  
The  Evaluable  Population  was  comprised  of  subjects  who  met  criteria  (randomized  and  received  at 
least one  dose of  a  test  article;  no  major protocol  deviations.;  and  at  least  1 adequate  post-baseline 
disease  assessment).  Supportive  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were  also 
performed in the Evaluable Population. 
Primary Analysis 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  test  stratified  by 
Sokal score and geographic region as baseline factors at time of randomisation. The asymptotic 95% 
confidence  intervals  (CIs)  for  the  adjusted  odds  ratio  (OR),  rates  and  rate  difference  along  with 
asymptotic 95% CI of MMR at 48 weeks were also calculated. Efficacy was demonstrated if there was a 
statistically significant difference in the proportion of subjects with MMR at 48 weeks, when comparing 
the treatment arms at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level.  
Interim analyses 
Two interim futility analyses were performed based on the MMR status of approximately the first 33% 
and  the  first  66%  of  the  randomized  Ph+  subjects,  who  were  Ph+  harboring  b2a2  and/or  b3a2 
transcripts  (ie,  the  mITT  Population).  The  IA  allowed  stopping  the  study  for  reasons  of  futility.  The 
provision to stop for futility was nonbinding.

Recruitment 
In study AV001, a total of 183 sites were initiated but 37 of these sites did not randomize any subjects 
(including 32 sites that did not screen any subjects). Thus, of the 151 sites that screened subjects, 5 
sites had screen failures. The study randomized subjects at 146 centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, 
Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Hungary,  Israel,  Italy,  Mexico,  Netherlands, 
Norway,  Poland,  Singapore,  Slovakia,  South  Africa,  South  Korea,  Spain,  Sweden,  Taiwan,  Thailand, 
Ukraine, UK and USA.

a. Not MMR included subjects not having a MMR at the Month 12 (Week 48) assessment.  
b. The p-value was based on a CMH test for general association between treatment and response with stratification 
by  Sokal  risk  group  (low,  intermediate,  high)  and  Region  (1-3)  as  determined  at  time  of  randomization.  If  odds 
ratio  of  bosutinib  vs  imatinib  >1  then  the  1-sided  p-value=1-probnorm  (square  root  (CMH  statistic)).  If  the  odds 
ratio  is  ≤1  then  the  1-sided  p-value=1-probnorm  (-square  root  (CMH  statistic)),  where  probnorm=normal 
distribution  function.  Note:  Percentages  were  based  on  number  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm.  MMR  was 
defined  as  ≤0.1%  BCR-ABL  ratio  on  international  scale  (corresponding  to  ≥3  log  reduction  from  standardized 
baseline) with a minimum of 3000 ABL transcripts assessed by the central laboratory.  
Table 18: 95% Confidence Intervals for MMR at Month 12 and associated odds ratio by 
treatment arm - mITT Population (Study AV001) 
Data  for  MMR  at  12  months  in  the  Ph  unrestricted  (ie,  Ph+  and  Ph-)  subject  population  (ITT 
Population) were similar to the Ph+ mITT Population: a higher proportion of subjects achieved MMR in 
the  bosutinib  arm  compared  to  the  imatinib  arm  (125  [46.6%]  subjects  vs  97  [36.2%]  subjects, 
respectively;  1-sided  p-value=0.0063  based  on  CMH  test  stratified  by  Sokal  score  and  Region  (data

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Major Molecular Response (MMR) at Month 18  
The results for the analysis of the exploratory endpoint, MMR at Month 18 based on a database 
snapshot date of 30 March 2017 (data cutoff date of 02 February 2017 were provided as 
supplementary information to the results of the primary endpoint analysis based on a database 
snapshot date of 02 November 2016 (data cutoff date of 11 August 2016). Whereas the MMR rate 
increased in both treatment arms between the 12-month and 18-month time points, the MMR rate at 
Month 18 in the mITT Population remained higher in the bosutinib arm (56.9%, 95% CI: 50.7, 63.1) 
than in the imatinib arm (47.7%, 95% CI: 41.4, 54.0), with a 1-sided p-value (CMH test stratified by 
Sokal score and geographic region) = 0.0208.  
The results in the ITT Population were consistent with the results in the mITT Population: the MMR rate 
was higher in the bosutinib arm (56.7%, 95% CI: 50.8, 62.6) than in the imatinib arm (46.6%, 95% 
CI: 40.7, 52.6), with a 1-sided p-value (CMH test stratified by Sokal score and geographic region) =

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Duration of MMR and CCyR 
Data for duration of MMR and CCyR were not mature at the data cut-off date. Of the 142 (57.77%) 
patients in the bosutinib arm and 122 (50.6%) patients in the imatinib arm that achieved MMR 
anytime on-treatment in the mITT Population, 4 patients (3 patients in the bosutinib arm and 1 patient 
in the imatinib arm) had events at the time of data cut-off (events defined as confirmed loss of 
response, treatment discontinuation due to disease progression to AP/BP CML, and deaths that 
occurred due to disease progression within 28 days after last dose). 
Of the 197 (80.1%) subjects in the bosutinib arm and 175 (72.6%) subjects in the imatinib arm that 
achieved CCyR anytime on-treatment in the mITT Population, 6 patients (3 patients in each treatment 
arm) had events at the time of the data cut-off (data not shown).

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Event-free Survival 
Data for on-treatment EFS was not mature at the data cut-off date; 4 on-treatment deaths were 
reported (0 death in the bosutinib treatment arm and 4 deaths in the imatinib arm). Of 246 patients in 
the bosutinib arm, 10 (4.1%) patients had events of interest (defined as either death, transformation 
to AP or BP, doubling of WBC without CHR, loss of CCyR or loss of CHR) and 49 (19.9%) patients had 
competing risk events (treatment discontinuation without an EFS event). Of the 241 (49.5%) patients 
in the imatinib arm, 15 (6.2%) patients had events of interest with competing risk events reported for 
56 (23.2%) subjects.  The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of EFS events at week 48 was 3.7% (1.8, 
6.7) in the bosutinib arm and 6.4% (3.7, 10.0) in the imatinib arm in the mITT Population (data not 
shown). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  Overall      Survival 
Data for OS was not mature at the data cut-off date; at this time-point 7 patients had died during the 
study.  The K-M estimate of OS at Week 48 was 99.6% (95% CI: 97.0, 99.9) in the bosutinib arm and 
97.9% (95% CI:  95.0, 99.1) in the imatinib arm in the mITT Population (data not shown). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Updated results 
Updated efficacy results from study AV001 are presented after a minimum of 24 months of follow-up 
(time from last patient enrolled to data cutoff of 12 July 2017).

blast proliferation, other than in spleen. 
f.  Cumulative incidence curves adjusting for the competing risk of treatment discontinuation without the event. 
g.  EFS is defined as death due to any cause, transformation to AP or BP at any time on treatment, loss of CHR 
(defined as a hematologic assessment of non-CHR [CP, AP, or BP] confirmed by 2 assessments at least 4 weeks 
apart), loss of CCyR (defined as ≥1 Ph+ out of <100 metaphases confirmed by a follow-up cytogenetic analysis >1 
month later), and for subjects not achieving a CHR: doubling of WBC count at least 1 month apart with the second 
value >20 x 109/L and maintained in subsequent assessments for at least 2 weeks.

* Of the 10 transformation events reported, 5 were not considered to be true transformation events. Three (3) of 
the bosutinib arm patients and 2 of the imatinib arm patients had CP CML that transformed to AP/BP CML within 2 
weeks  after  randomization,  and  none  of  the  5  patients  permanently  discontinued  treatment  due  to  disease 
progression or death. It was considered that these events were not true transformation events, since their clinical 
courses were not consistent with AP/BP. The remaining 
5  patients  had  CP  CML  that  transformed  to  AP/BP  CML  during  Weeks  12  to  36,  and  all  5  patients  permanently 
discontinued treatment due to disease progression (1 patient in each treatment arm had CP CML that transformed 
to  BP  CML).  One  patient  in  each  treatment  arm  who  had  CP  CML  that  transformed  to  AP/BP  CML  by  Week  2 
achieved MMR after transformation. 
Type of BCR-ABL mutations present at treatment completion/discontinuation or suboptimal 
response in each treatment arm and presence of newly observed BCR-ABL mutations in subjects post-
baseline, and correlation with response to treatment in imatinib and bosutinib treatment arms:  
Of the 173 subjects with mutation testing at the end of treatment visit, a similar proportion of subjects 
(1.6%, 4/246 subjects) in the bosutinib arm had an emergent mutation compared to subjects (4.1%, 
10/241) in the imatinib arm. 
Subject Reported Outcomes 
Patient-reported  HRQoL  was  assessed  by  the  FACT-Leu.  All  subscales  showed  either  improvement 
(Emotional  Well-Being,  Leukemia  symptoms,  FACT-total  score)  or  maintenance  (Physical,  Functional, 
and  Social  Well-Being,  FACT-General,  and  the  Trial  Outcome  Index)  of  HRQoL  at  12  months  (48 
weeks)  for  both  bosutinib and  imatinib,  with  no  differences  observed  between the  treatment  arms  at 
any time-point, up to and including Month 12. 
Functional  health  status  as  measured  by  the  EQ-5D  utility  score,  was  maintained  up  to  Month  12  for 
bosutinib, and was improved with imatinib at Month 12, however, there were no differences between 
bosutinib and imatinib at any time-point up to Month 12 (data not shown).

MMR was defined as ≤ 0.1% BCR-ABL 
(corresponding to ≥3 log reduction from 
standardized baseline) with a minimum of 
3000 ABL transcripts as assessed by the 
central laboratory. MMR was counted only if 
the response was demonstrated at the Week 
48 visit; an MMR gained and lost before the 
Week 48 visit was deemed a non-response. 
CCyR: defined as having 0% Ph+ 
chromosome present based on analysis of 
20 to 99 metaphases from bone marrow or if 
0 Ph+ out of <20 metaphases were 
available, then CCyR was imputed only if 
MMR was observed on that assessment 
date.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Subgroup comparisons in Study AV001 were undertaken to evaluate whether treatment differences in 
MMR rates at 1 year varied according to baseline characteristics. Characteristics included age (<65 vs 
≥65 years), race (white vs non-white [including Asian,  Black or African American, or other]), gender 
(male vs female), ECOG performance status at baseline (0 vs >0), Sokal risk (low, intermediate, high), 
and  geographic  region  (Region  1:  US,  Canada,  and  Western  Europe;  Region  2:  Eastern  Europe  and 
Latin America; Region 3: ROW).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study  AV001  was  designed  to  evaluate the  efficacy  of  bosutinib 400  mg  compared  with  imatinib  400 
mg  in  the  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  Ph+  CP  CML.  The  design  of  Study  AV001  was 
generally  similar  to  that  of  the  previously  conducted  Study  1008  in  which  bosutinib  500  mg  was 
compared  with  imatinib  400  mg  in  the  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  Ph+  CP  CML. 
However, in the approximately 5.5 years between the start of Study 1008 and Study AV001, MMR has 
replaced  CCyR  as  the  standard  method  of  disease  assessment,  and  physicians  have  improved  their 
handling of AEs secondary to bosutinib therapy due to the growing experience with the drug. 
The  bosutinib  dose  of  400  mg  was  chosen  for  Study  AV001  based  on  the  safety  experience  with 
bosutinib 500 mg per day in Study 1008. Imatinib was chosen as the active comparator because it was 
the  first  TKI  approved  for  the  treatment  of  CML  and  is  the  most  frequently  used  agent  of  those 
approved  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  Ph+  CP  CML.  The  use  of  imatinib  as  the  active 
comparator in both studies is in accordance with the NCCN guidelines ( NCCN 2017) and the European 
Leukemia  Net  Recommendations  (Baccarani,  2013),  in  which  imatinib,  dasatinib,  and  nilotinib  are  all 
considered  standard  of  care  in  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  Ph+  CML  who  are  not  eligible  for  stem

cell  transplant.  Moreover,  imatinib  was  also  used  as  the  active  comparator  in  investigations  of  both 
dasatinib  and  nilotinib.  In  conclusion,  the  selection  of  the  comparator  as  well  as  the  400  mg  dose  of 
bosutinib is well justified and was agreed during the study planning. 
Study  AV001  employed  an  open-label  design  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  dosing  regimens  allowed 
(due to the different doses and different steps for dose escalation and dose reduction that were used). 
This is fully acceptable due to the use of objective efficacy outcome measures such as MMR and CCyR 
which  minimize  potential  bias  created  by  the  open-label  design.  Moreover,  an  open  design  was  also 
used in other pivotal trials in CML and the differences in safety profile (high incidence of diarrhoea in 
bosutinib) would have additionally affected any blinding attempt. The CHMP considered that the open 
trial  design  was  acceptable,  taken  into  account  the  applicant’s  efforts  to  reduce  bias  and  considering 
that nilotinib and dasatinib also were investigated in unblinded pivotal clinical trials. 
Both  Ph+  and  Ph-  CP  CML  patients  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  Study  AV001.  This  was  done  to 
facilitate  enrollment  and  improve  access  to  treatment  for  newly  diagnosed  patients.  Cytogenetic 
assessment  for  the  Ph  chromosome  was  not  required  for  enrollment  into  Study  AV001,  but  Ph 
chromosome  status  was  identified  at  screening.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  selection  of  the  patient 
population  based  on  the  presence  of  BCR-ABL  RNA  transcripts  reflects  the  current  approach  to  the 
diagnosis  of  CML  (NCCN  2017)  and  is  consistent  with  the  choice  of  primary  endpoint  (MMR  at  12 
months) in Study AV001. 
Stratification  was  performed  based  on  known  prognostic  characteristics.  Patient  characteristics  were 
comparable across treatment arms in Study AV001 and were consistent with those for both treatment 
arms in Study 1008. They were generally reflective of the population of newly diagnosed patients with 
Ph+ CP CML expected to receive treatment with bosutinib, ie, older adults. 
The efficacy outcome measures used in Study AV001 are standard measures used in the evaluation of 
the treatment of CML (NCCN 2017; Baccarani, 2013). MMR at 12 months was chosen as the primary 
endpoint in Study AV001 rather than CCyR at 12 months, which was  used in the previously designed 
Study  1008.  The  achievement  and  maintenance  of  MMR  has  become  increasingly  recognized  as  an 
important  endpoint in  CML  therapy  as  it  appears  to  be  predictive of  long-term  EFS  (Hanfstein,  2012; 
Hughes,  2014).  MMR  at  12  months  was  the  primary  endpoint  in  ENESTnd,  a  Phase  3,  randomized, 
open-label,  multicenter  study  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  nilotinib  with  imatinib  in  patients 
with newly diagnosed CML (Saglio, 2010; Saglio, 2013). 
The primary endpoint of MMR at 12 (and 18 months) has now replaced CCyR as the standard method 
of  disease  assessment  in  CP-CML  and  is  the  most  relevant  accepted  surrogate  endpoint  for  overall 
survival in the target population. This is reflected by the recent change in the relevant EMA guideline 
document on CML which recommends that superiority versus a licensed comparator should be shown 
for the primary endpoint of major molecular response at 18 months.  However, MMR at 12 months is 
also  acceptable  since  MMRs  at  12  months,  compared  with  no  MMRs  at  this  time  point,  is  associated 
with superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival after 36 months. 
Exploratory  endpoints  in  Study  AV001  included  MMR  at  3  months  and  also  MR4  and  MR4.5,  which 
represent  deep  and  stable  molecular  responses,  as  these  are  considered  predictive  of  long-term 
outcomes  (Fava,  2015).  Depth  of  response  is  an  important  clinical  objective  for  patients  with  CML; 
patients  who  achieve  complete  molecular  response  (MR4  and  MR4.5)  have  better  event-free  and 
failure-free survival which confers a better outcome (Jabbour, 2011; Hanfstein, 2012; Etienne, 2014). 
CCyR  was  included  as  a  secondary  endpoint  in  Study  AV001  which  was  acceptable.  Moreover,  the 
Assessment report

applicant analysed also MMR at 18 months as a key secondary endpoint. Results for MMR at 18 months 
were included as supplementary information in this regulatory submission based on a later data cutoff 
date than the one that was used for the 12-month analysis. This is reasoned due to the fact that this 
slightly  more  conservative  endpoint  is  recommended  in  the  relevant  CHMP  guideline  document  as 
primary endpoint for superiority trials in the EU. It is welcomed to have this result for confirming the 
robustness of the clinical outcome of the pivotal trial. 
The mITT Population was the pre-specified primary efficacy analysis population in the protocol and was 
chosen to align the populations for the molecular and cytogenetic endpoints as CCyR is only assessable 
for Ph+ CP CML patients. Inclusion into the mITT Population was based on baseline transcript and Ph 
status determined at screening, and thus introduced minimal bias as a subgroup ITT analysis. 
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  discussed  the  study  design,  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints,  the 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  as  well  as  the  statistical  approach,  and  concluded  thatthere  are  no 
relevant concerns regarding the design of study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In Study AV001, treatment with bosutinib 400 mg once daily resulted in a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of MMR at 12 months (48 weeks) compared 
to imatinib (47.2% vs 36.9%, 1-sided p-value=0.0100). Therefore, the pivotal trial reached its primary 
objective and demonstrated adequately the claimed superiority over imatinib in the intended first line 
CP-CML target population. Consistent with the results of Study AV001, the MMR rate at 12 months (48 
weeks) was also higher in the bosutinib arm than in the imatinib arm of supportive Study 1008 which 
might be a chance finding, but also could reflect the more constant drug levels in trial AV001 due to a 
better tolerability of the 400 mg dose in comparison to the previously administered 500 mg bosutinib. 
This  may  be  caused  due  to  a  change  in  the  treatment  paradigm  from  2008  to  2017  whereby  more 
patients  had  their  dose  escalated  on  imatinib  allowing  them  to  achieve  a  better  response.  The 
improvement  in  MMR  at  12  months  in  favor of  bosutinib  was  maintained  in the  sensitivity  analysis in 
the ITT Population and the subgroup analysis (Sokal score, geographic region, age, gender, and race). 
With respect to secondary endpoint MMR at 18 months the superiority seems to be also robust in both 
analysis  populations:  56.9%  in  the  bosutinib  arm  vs  47.7%  in  the  imatiniob  arm,  1-sided  p-
value=0.0208 in the mITT Population and  56.7% in the bosutinib arm vs 46.6% in the imatiniob arm, 
1-sided p-value=0.0099 in the ITT Population). 
The  efficacy  of  bosutinib  in  Study  AV001  was  further  supported  by  the  analysis  of  the  secondary 
endpoint of CCyR by 12 months (48 weeks), which was statistically significantly higher in the bosutinib 
arm than in the imatinib arm (77.2% vs 66.4%, 1-sided p value= 0.0037). In Study 1008, the CCyR at 
12 months (48 weeks) was similar in both treatment arms likely due to the higher and earlier rate of 
permanent discontinuations due to AEs in the bosutinib arm vs the imatinib arm; however, the CCyR 
by  Month  12  rates  were  consistent  with  Study  AV001.  Moreover,  other  secondary  endpoints  as 
duration of MMR (57.7% vs. 50.6%), duration of CCyR (80.1% vs 72.6%), event-free survival (3.7% 
vs.  6.4%)  and  overall  survival  (99.6  vs  97.9%)  were  also  consistently  in  favour  for  bosutinib. 
However,  it  should  be  considered  that  results  for  these  endpoints  are  not  mature  at  12  months  and 
long  term  experience  is  necessary.  As  requested  the  applicant  has  provided  an  update  of  efficacy 
outcome after 24 months. In conclusion, the updated 24 months results indicated no clinical relevant 
change in the efficacy benefit shown for bosutinib at 12 months; the benefits of bosutinib over imatinib 
continued  to  be  clinically  meaningful  at  24  months  and  remain  stably  in  both  the  mITT  and  ITT 
populations.

On-treatment transformations events to AP or BP CML were low for both treatment arms in both Study 
AV001 and Study 1008, and were numerically lower in patients in the bosutinib arm vs imatinib in both 
studies.  These  results  further  support  the  suggestion  of  a  more  beneficial  long-term  outcome  with 
bosutinib. 
As  would  be  expected  with  effective  therapies  used  over  a  long  period  of  time,  few  EFS  (defined  as 
death, transformation to AP or BP, doubling of WBC without CHR, loss of CCyR, or loss of CHR) were 
observed  in  either  treatment  arm  after  a  minimum  of  12  months  of  follow-up.  Although  data  for  this 
endpoint were not mature at the data cutoff date it is reported that patients in the bosutinib arm had 
less events on treatment [(B: 10 (4.1%) vs I: 15 (6.2%)] and remains consistent in favour also after 
longer observation times; at 24 months B:5.3% vs I: 7.1% were reported. 
With  respect  to  patient-reported  outcome  HRQoL  was  maintained  for  up  to  12  months.  All  subscales 
showed  either  improvement  (EWB,  Leukemia  symptoms,  FACT-total  score)  or  maintenance  (PWB, 
FWB, and SWB, FACT-General, and the TOI) of HRQoL at 12 months (48 weeks) for both bosutinib and 
imatinib,  with  no  statistically  significant  differences  observed  between  treatments.  This  is  consistent 
with the long-term maintenance of HRQoL observed in Study 1008-3000WW. 
In  Study  AV001  onset  of  CCyR  and  MMR  was  more  rapid  and  showed  deeper  levels  of  molecular 
response in patients treated with bosutinib, as reflected in higher percentages of patients obtaining an 
MR4 and MR 4.5, than imatinib. This might indicate a better long-term outcome.  
As seen for other second generation TKIs after longer periods (24 months) the difference regarding the 
efficacy  outcomes  becomes  smaller,  which  is  deemed  to  indicate  rather  a  well  known  difference  in 
reponse kinetic for imatinib compared with other second generation CML TKIs than a lost of efficacy. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  Study  AV001  bosutinib  400  mg  has  demonstrated  a  robust  statistical  significant  superiority  in 
efficacy comparare to imatinib in terms of the primary endpoint MMR in newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML 
adult  patients.  Therefore,  a  significant  clinical  benefit  in  this  patient  population  was  convincingly 
demonstrated.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety results for individual studies and pooled sets of studies are presented as follows: 
Safety Set 1 
Results from the pivotal Phase 3 Study AV001 conducted in newly diagnosed Ph+ CP 
CML to evaluate the safety profile of bosutinib 400 mg in this target population. In 
addition, safety of bosutinib 400 mg given once daily is compared with imatinib 400 
mg given once daily. 
Safety Set 2 
Comparison of Study AV001 versus Study 1008-3000WW. An evaluation of the safety 
of bosutinib 400 mg/daily in Study AV001 with that of bosutinib 500 mg/daily in Study 
1008-3000WW (12-Month Analysis) was conducted in order to evaluate differences in 
safety between the 2 doses of bosutinib in the newly diagnosed CML patient 
population. For this analysis, the studies were not pooled together and results are 
given at 12 months analysis, respectively. Imatinib arms are not included in the 
analysis.

Safety Set 3  Newly diagnosed CP CML pool. An evaluation of the bosutinib safety profile from a 
pooled analysis of Studies AV001, 1008 (5 year data), and 1040 (Study 1008 first line 
patients only with an additional 2 years of data) was conducted in order to identify any 
potential safety issues specific to the target population of newly diagnosed CML 
patients regardless of starting dose. This pool is described as “Patients with Newly 
diagnosed CP CML” in the SCS. 
Safety Set 4 
All Leukemia Pool. An evaluation of the bosutinib safety profile, regardless of diagnosis, 
line of therapy, and starting dose, in patients with CML and Ph+ ALL from a pooled 
analysis of Studies AV001, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1039, and 1040 (all patients regardless 
of line of therapy) was conducted to potentially identify any adverse events associated 
with bosutinib that may not have been evident from the individual studies or a smaller 
pool.  
This pool includes long-term safety information from 4 and 5 years of follow-up in 
Studies 1006 and 1008, respectively, and approximately 6 and 7 years of follow-up 
from Studies 1006 and 1008 patients, respectively, who rolled over to Study 1040. 
Safety Analyses 
All safety variables were summarized using the Safety Population. AE summaries included incidence of 
treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  by  treatment  and  system  organ  class  (SOC)  and  preferred  term, 
SAEs, AEs that led to study drug discontinuation, AEs by maximum severity and relationship to study 
drug were also summarized by treatment, SOC and preferred term. AEs and AESI categories including 
cardiac,  hemorrhage,  effusion,  edema,  myelosuppression,  anemia,  thrombocytopenia,  liver  function, 
infection, rash, hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal toxicity, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and renal toxicity 
were summarized. 
AE summaries included the number and percentage of subjects having each event and the number of 
events. Subjects with multiple occurrences of the same event were counted only once for a specific PT. 
Comparisons  among  treatment  arms  were  performed  using  Fisher’s  exact  test  for  AESI  and  AE 
incidence  of  ≥5%,  ≥10%,  and  ≥20%  and  other  AE  summaries  as  deemed  appropriate.  No 
adjustments  for  multiple  comparisons  were  made.  Digital  ECG  data  were  collected  (in  triplicate  and 
averaged) at screening and on Days 1, 28, 56 and 84 pre-dose and at the treatment completion visit. 
ECHO or MUGA scans were performed at Screening (within 2 weeks of starting treatment) and at end 
of treatment or at 2 years, whichever was soonest and as clinically indicated.  
Mean  change  from  baseline  to  each  visit  were  analyzed  for  ECG  parameters  QT,  RR,  PR,  and  QTc, 
using  a  fixed-effects  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  model,  adjusted  for  baseline,  with  term  of 
treatment  on  the  raw  and/or  rank  transformed  values,  as  appropriate.  The  RR  interval  was  analyzed 
for  change  from  baseline  only.    Digital  ECG  data  were  collected  (in  triplicate  and  averaged)  at 
screening  and  on  Days  1,  28,  56  and  84  pre-dose  and  at  the  treatment  completion  visit.  ECHO  or 
MUGA  scans  were  performed  at  Screening  (within  2  weeks  of  starting  treatment)  and  at  end  of 
treatment or at 2 years, whichever was soonest and as clinically indicated. Mean change from baseline 
to each visit were analyzed for ECG parameters QT, RR, PR, and QTc, using a fixed-effects analysis of 
variance  (ANOVA)  model,  adjusted  for  baseline,  with  term  of  treatment  on  the  raw  and/or  rank 
transformed values, as appropriate. The RR interval was analyzed for change from baseline only.

Adverse events 
The following Table 28 shows the general safety outcome of the pivotal trial AV001 in which patients 
were  treated  with  400  mg  bosutinib od.  Moreover the  table  allows  a  direct  comparison  to  the  results 
observed  in  the  supportive  trial  1008-3000WW  in  which  the  500  mg  bosutinib  dose  was  used  in  the 
same population.

The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥ 5%) were ALT increased, thrombocytopenia, AST 
increased  and  lipase  increased,  diarrhea,  and  neutropenia  for  patients  receiving  bosutinib  compared 
with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lipase increased for patients receiving imatinib. The Grade 3 
or 4 TEAEs that were reported at a higher incidence (≥ 5% difference) in the bosutinib arm compared 
with the imatinib arm were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, ALT increased, and AST increased. 
The Grade 3 or 4 TEAE that was reported at a higher incidence (≥ 5% difference) in the imatinib arm 
compared with the bosutinib arm was neutropenia.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
In  Study  AV001,  the  overall  incidence  of  cardiac,  effusion,  hypersensitivity,  hypertension,  renal,  and 
vascular AESIs was <8% in both treatment arms.  
Myelosuppression 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  myelosuppression  TEAEs  was  similar  between  both  treatment  arms.  In  the 
bosutinib  arm,  myelosuppression  was  predominantly  due  to  Thrombocytopenia/Platelet  count 
decreased (35.1% vs 19.6%) which were primarily Grade 1 or 2 in severity, while in the imatinib arm, 
myelosuppression  was  predominantly  due  to  Neutropenia/Neutrophil  count  decreased  (11.2%  with 
bosutinib  and  20.8  %  with  imatinib);  the  incidence  of  Anemia/Hemoglobin  decreased  was  essentially 
the same in each treatment arm (18.7 vs 18.9%). 
Hemorrhage 
Haemorrhage events occurred slightly rarer in the bosutinib arm (15.3% bosutinib vs 16.2% imatinib), 
although thrombocytopenia/Platelet count decreased were more often reported in bosutinib (B:35.1% 
vs I:19.6%). This is explained by the fact that most of thrombocytopenia events were Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity; at this grade consequences in terms of increased bleeding events are generally not expected.  
Infection 
Whether the higher infection rates in the imatinib arm (44.4% bosutinib vs 47.2% imatinib) are really 
reflecting  a  clinical  relevant  difference  may  be  challenged,  as  the  difference  between  both  arms 
regarding infection is small.

Edema  AESIs  were  lower  in  the  bosutinib  arm  (10.1 %  bosutinib  vs  38.9%  imatinib)  and  rash  AESIs 
(33.6% vs 22.6%) were higher in the bosutinib arm. 
Gastrointestinal 
Diarrhoea events, occurred significantly more frequent in the bosutinib arm compared with the imatinib 
arm  (B:70.1%  vs  I:  33.6%).  The  majority  of  these  events  were  Grade  1  in  severity,  and  few  led  to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug (2 patients in each treatment arm). 
Grade 1 diarrhoea was reported in 42.9%, Grade 2 in 19.4% and Grade 3 in 7.8% of patients in the 
bosutinib  arm  compared  with  26.8%  ,  6.0%  and  0.8%,  respectively,  of  patients  in  the  imatinib  arm. 
No Grade 4 or 5 Diarrhoea was reported in either arm. Diarrhoea resolved in 75.5% of patients in the 
bosutinib  arm  and  58.4%  of  patients  in  the  imatinib  arm.  The  onset  of  diarrhoea  with  bosutinib  was 
primarily within the first month of treatment. Diarrhoea decreased in incidence and severity at Month 
2. Among those patients with persistent diarrhoea, the severity was primarily Grade 1. The incidence 
of  diarrhoea  with  imatinib  was  low  but  persisted  throughout  treatment.  In  the  few  patients  who  had 
dose escalations, there did not appear to be any dose-related increase in Diarrhoea in either treatment 
arm. 
Liver-related and GI  
The  overall  incidences  of  liver-related  and  GI  TEAEs  were  higher  in  the  bosutinib  arm.  Of  the  liver-
related  events,  ALT  increased  and  AST  increased  had  notably  higher  incidences  in  the  bosutinib  arm 
than  in  the  imatinib  arm. However,  most  patients  were  successfully  rechallenged  with  study  drug.  Of 
the 69 patients in the bosutinib treatment arm who had temporary treatment discontinuations, 76.2% 
(48/63  were  successfully  rechallenged,  defined  as  having  no  subsequent  AE  of  that  type  or  not 
permanently discontinued due to that type of AE. No cases of Hy’s law were identified in either arm. In 
the few patients who had their daily dose escalated to 500 mg or 600 mg, there did not appear to be 
any dose-related increases in ALT or AST in either treatment arm. Comparing bosutinib 400 mg daily 
(Study AV001) and bosutinib 500 mg daily (Study 1008) after a minimum of 12 months of follow-up, 
the overall incidence of liver-related TEAEs was lower for the bosutinib 400 mg daily dose than for the 
bosutinib  500  mg  daily  dose  (39.9%  vs  46.4%);  however,  the  incidence  of  AST  increased  and  ALT 
increased were similar between the 2 doses. 
The  incidence  of  GI  TEAEs  of  any  severity  grade  was  similar  for  patients  receiving  bosutinib  400  mg 
daily  and  bosutinib  500  mg  daily  (76.1%  vs  75.0%  respectively).  The  incidences  of  Diarrhoea  and 
Nausea  were  similar  for  each  dosing  regimen;  however,  the  incidence  of  Vomiting  was  lower  in 
patients  receiving  bosutinib  400  mg  daily  compared  with  patients  receiving  bosutinib  500  mg  daily 
(17.9% vs 31.9%, respectively). 
No new safety signals with regards to AESIs were identified in the newly diagnosed CP CML pool or the 
All Leukemia pool. 
Immunological events 
The  overall  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  TEAEs  was  <2.5%  in  both  treatment  arms  in  AV001.  In  the 
bosutinib  arm,  the  only  hypersensitivity  TEAE  that  occurred  in  more  than  1  patient  was 
hypersensitivity  (0.7%;  2/268)  compared  with  hypersensitivity,  seasonal  allergy,  and  drug 
hypersensitivity, which occurred in 2 patients (0.8%) each in the imatinib treatment arm.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event (SAEs) 
In  Study  AV001,  the  overall  incidence  of  all-causality  SAEs  was  slightly  numerically  higher  for  the 
bosutinib (20.1%) and imatinib (17.0%) arms. No SAEs were reported with an incidence ≥2% in either 
treatment arm. The overall incidence of treatment-related SAEs [TR-SAEs] was 10.1% (27/268) in the 
bosutinib  arm  compared  with  4.5%  (12/265)  in  the  imatinib  arm.  No  treatment-related  SAE  PT  was 
reported in more than 1.5% of patients in either arm.

A comparison of safety set 2 results showed that the overall incidence of SAEs is significantly lower for 
the  400  mg  daily  dose  than  for  the  500  mg  daily  dose  (400  mg:  20.1  vs  500  mg  25.0%)  after  a 
minimum of 12 months of follow-up. There were no SAEs with an incidence ≥2% in patients receiving 
bosutinib  400  mg  daily,  but  the  known  toxicities  are  unmasked  in  the  population  receiving  bosutinib 
500  mg  daily  in  which  Diarrhoea  (3.6%),  ALT  increased  (2.8%),  and  Thrombocytopenia  and 
Pneumonia (2.4% each) occurred as SAEs with an incidence ≥2%.   
Deaths 
In  the  pivotal  trial,  there  were  few  deaths  at  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff:  1  patient  (0.4%)  in  the 
bosutinib arm and 6 patients (2.3%) in the imatinib arm. There were no on-treatment deaths on the 
bosutinib arm. A total of 4 patients died on treatment (ie, within 28 days of last dose) in the imatinib 
arm.  Of  these  4  deaths,  2  were  due  to  AEs  unrelated  to  study  drug  (Cerebrovascular  accident  and 
Pneumonia), 1 was due to a related AE of sepsis, and 1 was due to disease progression (Table 33).

An additional 3 patients (2 patients in the imatinib arm and 1 patient in the bosutinib arm) died more 
than  28  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  Of  the  3  deaths  that  occurred  off  treatment,  the  1 
death in the bosutinib arm (patient 120-10-01) was due to an AE of Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung 
(death  occurred  approximately  9  months  after  stopping  bosutinib  treatment  and  was  unrelated  to 
study drug), and the 2 deaths in the imatinib arm were due to disease progression.  
Laboratory findings 
In Study AV001, on-treatment, the overall incidence of Grade 3/4 laboratory test results was higher in 
the bosutinib arm compared with the imatinib arm (48.1% vs. 32.5 %) as shown in Table 34:

Data cutoff dates: AV001: 11 August 2016. 
Grades are based upon the NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0). 
Baseline is defined as the latest lab prior to first dose of the test article.

Abnormality', baseline maximum grade across all lab tests is summarized. 
Hepatotoxicity 
For ALT, 62 (23.1%) patients in the bosutinib treatment arm had a shift from baseline to Grade 3 or 4 
on treatment compared with 7 (2.7%) patients in the imatinib arm. 
For AST, 32 (12.0%) patients in the bosutinib treatment arm had a shift from baseline to Grade 3 or 4 
on  treatment  and  8  (3.0%)  patients  in  the  imatinib  arm  had  a  shift  from  baseline  to  Grade  3  on 
treatment. 
For bilirubin, 3 (1.1%) patients in the bosutinib treatment arm had a shift from baseline to Grade 3 on 
treatment  and  2  (0.8%)  patients  in  the  imatinib  arm  had  a  shift  from  baseline  to  Grade  3  on 
treatment. No patients in either arm had shifts to Grade 4 on treatment.  
There  were  no  cases  of  Hy’s  law  or  permanent  liver  injury  identified in  the  study,  although  three  (3) 
patients  in  the  bosutinib  arm  (400  mg  daily)  did  report  concomitant  transaminase  and  bilirubin

increases  that  met  the  laboratory  criteria  of  Hy’s  law  and  warranted  further  investigation,  which 
excluded the occurrence of severe drug induced liver injury.  
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) 
In Study AV001, the MDRD equation was used to calculate eGFR at baseline and on treatment. Shifts 
from baseline in eGFR by maximum KDIGO grade on treatment to Grade 3 or higher were reported for 
24 patients (Grade 3 a: 22 patients (8.2%) and Grade 3b: 2 patients [0.7%]) in the bosutinib arm. Of 
the  22  patients  with  Grade  3a  reported  at  baseline  in  the  bosutinib  arm,  11  (50.0%)  patients 
continued to have a maximum of Grade 3a on treatment; 7 (31.8%) patients were reported to have a 
maximum  of  Grade  3b,  and  1  (4.5%)  patient  was  reported  to  have  a  maximum  of  Grade  4  on 
treatment.  
In  the  imatinib  arm,  20  patients  were  reported  to  have  Grade  3a  at  baseline;  9  (45.0%)  patients 
continued to have a maximum of Grade 3a, 7 (35.0%) patients were reported to have a maximum of 
Grade 3b, and 3 (15.0%) patients were reported to have a maximum of Grade 4 on treatment. 
ECG and QT prolongation 
In Study AV001, on-therapy PCI changes in ECG were reported for 9 (3.5%) patients in the bosutinib 
arm compared with 6 (2.4%) patients in the imatinib arm who had at least 1 assessment (SCS Table 
51). When the QT interval was corrected using Bazett’s formula, only 1(0.4%) patient (in the imatinib 
arm) had an increase of >60 msec from baseline. There were no patients who had an increase of >60 
msec  from  baseline  when  the  QT  interval  was  corrected  using  Fridericia’s  formula.  One  (1  [0.4%]) 
patient in the bosutinib arm and no patients in the imatinib arm had a QTcF of >500 msec. 
ECHO or MUGA scans 
Cardiac events were infrequent in both arms. There were no shifts to Grade 4 LVEF decline and only 1 
Grade 3 shift in the bosutinib arm versus 0 Grade 3/4 in the imatinib arm.  
Safety in special populations 
In Study AV001, no statistical analyses were performed to compare the incidence or severity of TEAEs 
on  the  basis  of  age,  race,  or  gender.  However,  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  to  examine  the 
incidence of all-causality TEAEs and provide descriptive comparisons of results by age (<65 years, >65 
years),  race  (Black  or  African-American,  Asian,  White,  Other),  and  gender  (male,  female).  The 
treatment groups were balanced with respect to these characteristics. Of note, the majority of patients 
in  the  study  were  White  and  less  than  65  years  of  age,  and  there  were  slightly  more  males  than 
females  in  both  treatment  arms.  In  addition,  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  Grade  3/4/5 
TEAEs and SAEs. Deaths were summarized by age, race, or gender. 
Most  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  (safety  population)  were  <65  years.  In  the  bosutinib  arm  215 
(80.2%) patients were <65 years, and 53 (19.8%) patients were >65 years; in the imatinib arm 219 
(82.6%)  patients  were  <65  years  and  46  (17.4%)  patients  were  >65  years  (Table  35).  In  the 
bosutinib  arm,  TEAEs  were  reported  in  97.7%  of  patients  <65  years  and  100.0%  of  patients  >65 
years.  Grade  ≥3  TEAES  were  reported  in  54.0%  of  patients  <65  years  and  66.0%  of  patients  >65 
years.

There was a higher proportion of male than female patients in both treatment arms. In the bosutinib 
arm, 156 (58.2%) patients were male and 112 (48.1%) patients were female; in the imatinib arm 153 
(57.7)  patients  were  male  and  112  (42.3)  were  female.  TEAEs  were  reported  in  96.8%  of  male 
patients and 100.0% of female patients. Grade ≥3 TEAES were reported in 56.4% of male patients and 
56.3%  of  female  patients.  The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  (≥20%  of  patients)  in  the  bosutinib

A number of the most commonly reported TEAEs were more frequent (≥5% difference) among female 
than  male  patients,  including  diarrhoea,  nausea,  AST  increased,  rash,  fatigue,  abdominal  pain, 
anaemia,  vomiting,  headache.  of  these,  nausea,  rash,  anaemia,  vomiting,  and  headache  showed  a 
difference  of  ≥10%  between  the  2  groups.  Thrombocytopenia  was  more  frequent  (≥5%  difference) 
among male than female patients. SAEs were reported with a lower overall incidence among male than 
female  patients  (17.9%  vs.  23.2%).  As  most  individual  SAE  PTs  were  reported  for  1  or  2  patients  in 
each gender group, no conclusions can be made regarding differences in types of SAEs between male 
and female patients. 
In the bosutinib arm, TEAEs were reported in 98.1% of White, 97.0% of Asian, 100.0% of Other, and 
100.0% of Black or African-American patients. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in 55.7% of White, 
69.7% of Asian, 35.7% of Other, and 50.0% of Black or African-American patients. The most

a. Totals of the No. of Patients at a higher level are not necessarily the sum of those at the lower levels since a 
patient may report 2 or more different adverse events within the higher level category. 
Hepatotoxicity expressed in ALT increased (4.9%) and AST increased (2.2%) was only seen in patients 
receiving  bosutinib  while  Thrombocytopenia  (1.5%)  and  Myalgia  (1.1%)  were  the  most  important 
reasons for discontinuation in patients receiving imatinib:  
Treatment delay and Dose-reduction due to AEs 
Consistently, also the incidence of AEs leading to temporary treatment delays in trial AV001 was higher 
in the bosutinib arm than in the imatinib arm (56.7% vs 37.0% respectively). Again most of the delays 
were due to ALT increased (19.0% in the bosutinib arm vs 1.5% in the imatinib arm); AST increased 
(11.2% vs 1.5%, respectively), and Thrombocytopenia (14.6% vs 5.7%, respectively).  
And similarly also the incidence of AEs leading to dose reduction was higher in the bosutinib arm than 
in  the  imatinib  arm  (34.0%  vs  18.1%  respectively).  The  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  (≥1%) 
leading  to  dose  reduction  were  Thrombocytopenia  (6.7%),  ALT  increased  (6.0%),  Lipase  increased 
(4.5%),  AST  increased  (3.4%),  Neutropenia  (2.6%),  Diarrhoea  and  Nausea  (2.2%  each),  Rash 
(1.9%), Anaemia (1.5%), Amylase increased, Transaminases increased, Fatigue, and Vomiting (1.1% 
each) in patients receiving bosutinib compared with Neutropenia (3.8%), Thrombocytopenia and Rash 
(1.5%), Muscle Spasm and Myalgia (1.1% each) in patients receiving imatinib. 
In Set 2 Safety population (Studies AV001 and 1008; Non-Pooled Month 12 Analysis) the incidence of 
AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  14.2%  (38/268)  for  patients  receiving 
bosutinib 400 mg daily and 21.0% (52/248) for patients receiving bosutinib 500 mg daily. 
In  Set  4  Safety  population  (Patients  with  Newly  Diagnosed  CP  CML  and  All  Leukemia  Pools)  the 
incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 21.9% (113/516) in patients with newly 
diagnosed CP CML and 22.6% (287/1272) in the All Leukemia pool.  
Dose-dependence of discontinuation: 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  was  lower  for  patients  who  received 
bosutinib 400 mg than for those who received bosutinib 500 mg (14% vs 21%).  
Assessment report

Also the incidence of AEs leading to treatment delay was lower for patients who received bosutinib 400 
mg  in  Study  AV001  than  those  who  received  bosutinib  500  mg  in  Study  1008  (56.7%  vs  62.5%).  A 
similar number of patients in both treatment arms required dose reductions (34.0% vs 37.1%). 
Post marketing experience 
Bosutinib  is  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  CP,  AP  and  BP  Ph+  CML 
previously  treated  with  one  or  more  TKIs,  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib,  and  dasatinib  are  not 
considered appropriate treatment options. A 500 mg dose is recommended and used in this indication. 
Due  to  the  intensified  review  approach  as  consequence  of  a  conditional  approval,  and  the  need  for 
annual renewals, the MAH has submitted a number of Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) since the 
initial approval for bosutinib.  As of 15 February 2017, 8626 patients worldwide had been exposed to 
bosutinib commercially since approval. It is estimated that 2383 patients worldwide had participated in 
Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials, 2046 of whom had been exposed to bosutinib either as a single agent, 
in combination with placebo, or in combination with other study drug. 
From  this  data  the  important  identified  risks  for  bosutinib  in  the  current  RMP  are  hepatotoxicity,  GI 
toxicities,  hypersensitivity  reactions  (including  anaphylaxis),  fluid  retention,  myelosuppression,  QT 
interval  prolongation,  respiratory  tract  infections,  bleeding  events,  renal  dysfunction,  rash,  and 
pancreatitis.  The  important  potential  risks  of  bosutinib  are  cardiac  toxicity  (excluding  QT  interval 
prolongation),  interstitial  lung  disease,  thyroid  dysfunction,  tumour  lysis  syndrome,  bone  turnover 
/bone mineral metabolism disorders, and immunotoxicity.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Bosutinib  was  granted  conditional  marketing  authorisation  in  the  EU  on  27  March  2013  for  the 
treatment of adult patients with CP, AP and BP Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs, and 
for whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options.  
For  this  late  line  indication  a  higher  dose  of  500  mg  bosutinib  was  approved  and  post-marketing 
experience from more than 8000 patients as well as long term clinical study data (up to more than 5 
years) from Study 1008-3000WW is available. This issue substantiated the view that the general safety 
profile of bosutinib can be seen as well characterized for an orphan disease entity.  
Specific safety information supporting the newly applied treatment with a lower bosutinib dose of 400 
mg in the first-line CP-CML target population is assessed from the results of the pivotal trial AV001. All 
treated patients were included in the safety population.  
Supportive  results  from  the  previous  pivotal  phase  III  trial  Study  1008-3000WW  allows  a  better 
understanding of dose dependence of toxicities and adverse events observed. This trial was conducted 
prior  to  the  start  of  Study  AV001  and  failed  to  reach  the  expected  outcome,  but  provides  long  term 
safety outcome in the applied population up to 5 years of bosutinib treatment. However, it has to be 
considered  that  this  data  was  generated  with  the  higher  500  mg  dose  and  the  pooled  analysis  with 
AV001 reports the 12 months outcome only. 
As indicated by duration of study treatment (14.1 months for bosutinib vs. 13.8 months for imatinib), 
exposure in the pivotal trial AV001 was sufficient to conclude on safety in this orphan disease entity. 
Slightly  lower  median  dose  intensity  in  the  bosutinib  arm  (391.8  mg/daily  for  bosutinib  and  400.0 
mg/daily for imatinib) confirmsed that bosutinib has a more pronounced toxicity than imatinib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/187737/2018  
Page 74/93 
 
 
 
 
This  assumption  is  further  confirmed  by  the  consistently  higher  rates  for  TEAEs  (B:98.1%  vs.  I: 
97.0%),  grade  3  and  4  TEAEs  (B:56.0%  vs.  I:41.9%)  and  SAEs  (B:20.1%  vs.  I:17.0%)  and  also 
reflected by the finding that patients in trial AV001 in the bosutinib arm were more likely to experience 
a  dose  reduction  (B:34.7%  vs.  I:17.4%)  or  treatment  delay  (56.3%  vs.  35.8%)  due  to  AEs  than 
patients in  the  imatinib  arm.  This  is  in-line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  bosutinib  and  the  results 
from the previous direct comparison with imatinib in trial 1008-3000W.  
From  the  experience  in  the  approved  later  line  CML  population  and  the  reports  from  post-marketing 
bosutinib’s toxicities seemed to be tolerable and manageable. This is confirmed by the similar rates of 
permanent discontinuations due to AEs (B:14.2% vs. I: 10.6%)  and the finding that a similar number 
of  patients  treated  with  bosutinib  versus  imatinib  remained  on  treatment  (78.0%  vs.  73.2% 
respectively) in the safety population in the current pivotal trial AV001.  
In general it is acknowledged that both second generation TKI (nilotinib and dasatinib) as well as the 
approved third generation TKI ponatinib are known to have a more pronounced toxicity than imatinib. 
Insofar,  a  higher  toxicity  in  comparison  to  imatinib  can  be  expected  also  for  bosutinib  and  was  also 
documented in the initial trial 1008-3000WW.  
The  main  safety  risk  derived  from  bosutinib  are  due  to  higher  hepatotoxicity  (AST/ALT  elevations), 
gastrointestinal  adverse  events  (diarrhoea,  nausea  vomiting)  and  rash,  while  specific  concerns 
regarding cardiac safety or arrhythmias are rather minor according to the safety data available.  
In general, types and frequencies of TEAEs in Study AV001 were fully consistent with the known safety 
profile  of  bosutinib  and  no  new  safety  signal  was  identified  from  the  new  data.    The  most  common 
TEAEs  (incidence  ≥20%)  reported  were  diarrhoea  (70.1%),  nausea  and  thrombocytopenia  (35.1% 
each),  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  increased  (30.6%),  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST) 
increased (22.8%) for patients receiving bosutinib compared with nausea (38.5%), diarrhoea (33.6%), 
muscle spasms (26.4 %), and neutropenia (20.8%) for patients receiving imatinib. 
TEAEs  that  were  observed  with  a  higher  incidence  (>5%  difference)  in  the  bosutinib  arm  compared 
with the imatinib arm were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, ALT increased, AST increased, lipase increased, 
rash,  pruritus,  headache,  and  thrombocytopenia.  a  higher  incidence  (>5%  difference)  in  the  imatinib 
arm compared with the bosutinib arm were observed for oedema peripheral, muscle spasms, myalgia, 
pain in extremity, neutropenia, leukopenia, periorbital oedema, eyelid oedema, lacrimation increased, 
and hypokalaemia. 
Also similar to previous findings the rate of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was higher for bosutinib compared with 
imatinib  (56.0%  vs.  41.9%).  The  most  common  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  (≥5%)  reported  were  ALT 
increased  (19.0%),  thrombocytopenia  (13.8%),  AST  increased  and  lipase  increased  (9.7%  each), 
diarrhoea (7.8%), and neutropenia (6.7%) for patients receiving bosutinib compared with neutropenia 
(12.1%), thrombocytopenia (5.7%), and lipase increased (5.3%) for patients receiving imatinib.  
Cardiac events were infrequent in both arms. There were no shifts to Grade 4 LVEF decline and only 1 
Grade  3  shift  in  the  bosutinib  arm  versus  0  Grade  3/4  in  the  imatinib  arm.  There  was  1  Grade  3  QT 
prolongation (>500 msec) in the bosutinib arm versus 0 in the imatinib arm. The overall incidence of 
patients with a clinically significant ECG abnormality while on treatment was 7.5% in the bosutinib arm 
and 6.9% in the imatinib arm and thus, similar risk for arrhythmic events is likely.  
As expected from the known safety profile of bosutinib the overall incidence of gastrointestinal TEAEs 
was higher in the bosutinib arm (76.1%) than in the imatinib arm (53.6%). This is caused mainly by a 
notable  difference  in  reported  diarrhoea  (B:  70.1%  vs  I:  33.6%),  but  the  majority  of  these  events 
were  Grade  1  and  only  very  few  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  (2  patients  in  each  treatment 
arm).  The  lower  dose  of  400  mg  seems  to  be  associated  with  a  significant  reduction  of  vomiting  in 
comparison  to  the  500  mg  bosutinib  dose  (AV001:  400mg:  13.8%  vs  3000WW:  500  mg:  24.6%)  It 
Assessment report

can  be  speculated  that  decreased  vomiting  in  the  target  population  may  have  had  also  an  relevant 
impact  on  bosutinib’s  bioavailability  and  insofar  may  have  contributed  also  to  the  slightly  better 
efficacy outcome in AV001 compared with 1008-3000WW.  
The overall incidence of liver-related TEAEs was again higher in the bosutinib arm (39.9%) than in the 
imatinib  arm  (13.6%),  which  was  expected  from  the  known  safety  profile.  The  most  common  liver-
related  TEAEs  (≥20%)  were  ALT  increased  (30.6%  all  toxicity  grades  and  19.0%  Grade  3/4  for 
bosutinib and 5.7% and 1.5% for imatinib respectively), AST increased (22.8% all toxicity grades and 
9.7% Grade 3/4 for bosutinib and 6.4% and 1.9% for imatinib, respectively). Although most of these 
patients  were  successfully  re-challenged  with  bosutinib  (of  the  69  patients  who  had  temporary 
treatment discontinuations, 76.2% [48/63] were successfully re-challenged), the risk for drug induced 
liver injuries remains open. However, Hy’s law cases were again not observed in this trial. 
The overall incidence of rash TEAEs was higher in the bosutinib arm than in the imatinib arm (33.6% 
vs. 22.6%).  
Comparison  of  the  safety  profile  of  bosutinib  400  mg  daily  (Study  AV001)  with  that  of  bosutinib  500 
mg  daily  (Study  1008  12-month  analysis)  showed  that  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  (98.1%  vs. 
95.6%,  respectively).  Of  the  most  common  TEAEs  (≥10%)  the  only  notable  differences  (≥5% 
difference in frequency) in the incidence of AEs were fatigue (19.4% vs. 11.3%) and headache (18.7% 
vs. 11.3%), which were higher with the bosutinib 400 mg daily dose, and Vomiting, which was lower 
with the 400 mg daily dose (17.9% vs. 31.9%) compared with the 500 mg daily dose. The incidence of 
SAEs was 20.1% for the 400 mg dose and 25.0% for the 500 mg dose. No patients were reported to 
have  treatment-emergent  SAEs  with  an  incidence  ≥2%  with  the  bosutinib  400  mg  daily  dose  (Study 
AV001). 
The  incidence  of  myelosuppression  TEAEs  was  similar  in  the  bosutinib  (45.5%)  and  imatinib  (43.4%) 
arms.  In  the  bosutinib  arm  myelosuppression  was  predominantly  due  to  Thrombocytopenia/Platelet 
count  decreased  (35.1%  with  bosutinib  vs.  19.6%  imatinib),  which  were  primarily  Grade  1  and  2. 
While  in  the  imatinib  arm  myelosupression  was  predominantly  due  to  neutropenia/neutrophil  count 
decreased  (11.2%  with  bosutinib  vs.  20.8  %  with  imatinib).  Anemia/hemoglobin  decreased  rates  in 
both arms were essentially the same (18.7% vs. 18.9 %). 
On-treatment, the overall incidence of Grade 3/4 of laboratory test results was higher in the bosutinib 
arm  compared  with  the  imatinib  arm  (48.1%  vs.  32.5  %).  This  is  mainly  caused  due  to  the  higher 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  bosutinib  arm  than  in  the  imatinib  arm that  had  increased  ALT  and  AST 
levels.  
The eGFR shift from baseline for all grades was similar for both treatment arms with regards to degree 
of change over time. 
No relevant signal regarding the use of bosutinib in special population was detected.  
In the Phase 3 clinical study in patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML treated with bosutinib 400 mg, 
there  were  no  patients  in  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  with  an  increase  of  > 60 ms  from  baseline 
when the QT interval was corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety results from the submitted studies were generaly consistent with the known safety profile of 
bosutinib. No new safety signals were identified.

2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
In addition, the MAH should submit the following safety data within the next PSUR: 
•  Report any data of (1) patients with clinically significant cardiac disease (such as recent 
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or unstable angina recent or ongoing) and (2) 
with clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder e.g. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, or 
prior total or partial gastrectomy treated with bosutinib and the outcome, which allows to 
assess whether or whether not bosutinib can be safely administered in these patients. 
•  Report and briefly discuss on the number of cases with concomitant use of bosutinib with 
strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers/ inhibitors and/or PPIs. The discussion should include an 
assessment of causality of the reported ADRs with potential drug interaction in the respective 
cases (in line with current established guidelines – e.g. WHO-UMC). Finally the need for 
strategies/risk minimization measures to make physicians more vigilant for the risk of drug 
interactions of bosutinib with CYP3A4 inducers/ inhibitors and/or PPIs should be discussed. 
•  Report on ongoing and planned studies, in which real-world use including concomitant use of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers /PPIs will be captured, and to report on available evidence for 
concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors/PPIs with bosutinib in real-world use from these 
studies in the next PSUR (e.g. real-world use of bosutinib in the UK and the Netherland, 
Apperley et al. BSH, 2017) 
•  Report how many of the patients included in the supportive trial 1008-3000WW received 
bosutinib and CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors and/or PPIs concomitantly, and how this potentially 
affected treatment (dose reduction of bosutinib, treatment interruption, no change in 
treatment etc.) and outcome.

The MAH should submit an updated RMP per separate type II variation within the next 3 months 
updating the following: 
1.  update the summary of saferty concerns with  “Increased toxicity due to interactions with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, “Lack of efficacy due to interactions with CYP3A4 inducers or PPIs” as 
important identified risks and keep “long-Term Safety [>365 Days])” as a missing information. 
Please update the whole RMP accordingly. 
2.  update section III.2 and III.3 in line with “guidance on the format of the risk management plan 
(RMP) in the EU – in integrated format”.  In particular the “PASS short name summary” should 
be included for all additional pharmacovigilance activities (III.2) and specific safety concerns 
should be listed (III.3). Safety concerns listed here need to be in line with the summary of 
safety concerns. In example, the rat pre- and post-natal development study addresses the 
safety concern “pregnancy”. Multiple safety concerns can be addressed in one study. E.g. 
studies CT B1871039 and Study CT B1871040 are “hepatotoxicity”, “GI toxicities”, “QT 
prolongation”, “renal dysfunction”, “cardiac safety”, “safety in patients with cardiac 
impairment” and “safety in patients with recent or ongoing clinically significant gastrointestinal 
disorders”. Please update in the RMP sections III.2, III.3 and other affected sections 
accordingly. 
3.  submission of a track change version of the RMP (indicating changes between the RMP v4.1 of 
this variation and the latest version) 
4.  add the column “Additional pharmacovigilance activities” for the missing information 
pregnancy, along with the respective non-clinical study, in section II.B (table 54). 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC 
have been updated.  The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the SmPC is being updated with safety and efficacy data from studies B1871006 and 
B1871008. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which 
were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. In addition, the list of local representatives in the 
PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representative of Malta. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Bosulif is currently approved in EU for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated 
phase, and blast phase Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and 
for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered  appropriate  treatment  options.  A 
consultation with target patient groups (readability testing) was undertaken by an external consulting 
company  during  the  initial  MAA.  The  report  from  the  above  consultation  was  considered  as 
satisfactory. 
The  current  application  is  supporting  the  approval  of  a  new  indication  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
Assessment report

patients  with  accelerated  phase,  and  blast  phase  Ph+  CML  previously  treated  with  one  or  more 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor(s)  and  for  whom  imatinib,  nilotinib  and  dasatinib  are  not  considered 
appropriate  treatment  options.  The  changes  to  the  Package  Leaflet  due  to  this  new  application  are 
limited  to  the  indication  wording  and  do  not  significantly  alter  the  readability  of  the  approved 
document. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Bosulif (bosutinib) is proposed for the additional therapeutic indication of treatment for adult patients 
with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia 
(Ph+ CP CML). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Imatinib was approved for adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) CML for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as 
the first line of treatment in the EU in 2006. In 2010, dasatinib (Sprycel, orphan market exclusivity 
ended on 22 November 2016) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
(Ph+) CML in the chronic phase and nilotinib (Tasigna, orphan market exclusivity until 21 November 
2019) was approved the same year for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed (Ph+) 
CML in the chronic phase. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy is based on the AV001 study, a multicenter phase 3 randomized, open-
label study of bosutinib versus imatinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  the  pivotal  trial  AV001  treatment  with  bosutinib  400  mg  once  daily  was  statistically  significant 
superior  in  reaching  the  primary  endpoint  of  MMR  at  12  months  (48  weeks)  in  comparison  to  the 
comparator  400  mg  imatinib  [B:  47.2%  vs  I:  36.9%,  1-sided  p-value=0.0100,  mITT).  Sensitivity 
analyses  demonstrated  that  the  improvement  in  MMR  at  12  months  in  favor  of  bosutinib  was 
maintained also in the ITT population. 
Superiority with respect to in MMR rate in the bosutinib arm over the imatinib arm was also consistent 
at  18  months  (B:  56.9%  vs  I:47.7%,  1-sided  p-value=0.0208  in  the  mITT  population;  56.7%  vs 
46.6%,  1-sided  p-value=0.0099  in  the  ITT  population)  in  the  pivotal  trial  AV001.  Pre-specified 
subgroup  analyses  by  baseline  characteristics  of  age,  race,  and  gender  in  Study  AV001  showed  that 
the benefit of bosutinib treatment on the primary endpoint was consistent with the benefit of bosutinib 
treatment in the overall population.  
Assessment report

Consistency  of  efficacy  was  confirmed  by  the  outcome  of  the  key  secondary  endpoint  of  CCyR  by  12 
months  (48  weeks)  which    indicated  a  statistically  significant  superiority  for  bosutinib  compared  with 
imatinib (B: 77.2% vs I: 66.4%, 1-sided p value=0.0037). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
N/A 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (≥ 5%) were ALT increased, thrombocytopenia, AST 
increased  and  lipase  increased,  diarrhea,  and  neutropenia  for  patients  receiving  bosutinib  compared 
with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lipase increased for patients receiving imatinib. The Grade 3 
or 4 TEAEs that were reported at a higher incidence (≥ 5% difference) in the bosutinib arm compared 
with the imatinib arm were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, ALT increased, and AST increased. 
The Grade 3 or 4 TEAE that was reported at a higher incidence (≥ 5% difference) in the imatinib arm 
compared  with  the  bosutinib  arm  was  neutropenia.The  overall  incidence  of  SAEs  was  20.1%  in  the 
bosutinib arm vs. 17.0% in the imatinib arm. No SAEs were reported with an incidence of greater than 
or equal to 2% in either treatment arm. 
The rate of discontinuations due to AEs was only slightly higher similar for the bosutinib arm and the 
imatinib  arm  (14.2%  vs.  10.6%).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  in 
patients  receiving  bosutinib  were  ALT  increased  (4.9%)  and  AST  increased  (2.2%)  compared  with 
thrombocytopenia (1.5%) and myalgia (1.1%) in patients receiving imatinib.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Based  on  significantly  improved  MMR  and  CCyR  at  12  months,  together  with  evidence  of  faster  and 
deeper  molecular  responses  observed  with  CCyR  and  MMR,  bosutinib  in  the  pivotal  Study  AV001  has 
demonstrated clinically relevant superior efficacy in comparison to the standard of care imatinib in the 
treatment of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CP CML.  
The  well-known  safety  risks  associated  with  bosutinib  treatment  (most  important:  hepatotoxicity, 
gastrointestinal toxicity and myelotoxicity) were confirmed by the consistently higher TEAE, SAE, grade 
3/4 event rates in the bosutinib arm. However, the only slightly higher permanent discontinuation rate 
for bosutinib indicated that these risks can be seen as tolerable and manageable in clinical practice due 
to the broad experience with these types of agents.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In  conclusion,  in  view  of  the  robust  efficacy  benefit  over  standard  treatment  (imatinib)  in  terms  of 
MMR  at  12  months  and  the  observed  manageable  toxicity,  the  benefit-risk  balance  in  the  proposed 
indication is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Similar to other approved second and third generation CML-TKIs, bosutinib treatment was associated 
with a more rapid and deeper molecular responses compared with imatinib. This might indicate the 
potential for a more beneficial long-term outcome with bosutinib.  
The fact that the drug has been approved since 2012 and the availability of post-marketing data in 
more than 8000 patients (in an orphan disease population), have contributed to the safety database 
and hence, the risks of bosutinib are considered well known. No new sfety have been identified in the 
trial AV001.  
In general, there is some overlap in adverse event profile and safety risk due to disease immanent and 
drug class effect safety events between bosutinib and the direct comparator imatinib as well as other 
approved second generation CML-TKIs.  
In comparison to imatinib, bosutinib has a significantly higher hepatotoxicity detectable mainly in 
AST/ALT and bilirubin elevations. This risk seems to be the threefold higher with bosutinib; however, 
no Hy’s law case was observed in trials AV001 and 1008-3000WW.  
The gastrointestinal toxicity indicated by significantly higher incidence rates for diarrhoea, nausea and 
vomiting or increased lipase levels is clinical relevant and important as it may potentially impact 
patient’s quality of life and well-being significantly. Although in this context it is reassuring that QoL 
data failed to show a difference between both arms and a decrease of vomiting and a trend for 
decreased severity of gastrointestinal TEAEs in general was observed for the applied 400 mg dose. 
However, no signal for an increased rate of gastrointestinal malignancies or other long term 
consequences of drug induced diarrhoea was detected up to now.  
In conclusion, the higher general toxicity, particularly the hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity is 
clinically important and long term consequences remain not fully evaluable at present. Although the 
slightly higher permanent discontinuation rate in bosutinib arm seems to confirm an inferiority 
regarding safety in comparison with imatinib, this seems to be not very pronounced. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bosulif is positive.

Extension of Indication to include treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
Chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Phase (CP) Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia (CML) for Bosulif 
based on study AV001. In addition, the MAH updated the SmPC with safety and efficacy information 
from studies B1871006 and B1871008. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 
and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Moreover, the updated 
RMP version 4.1 was agreed during the procedure. Furthermore, the Annex IIIA is brought in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package 
Leaflet and Labelling and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Bosulif is not similar to Iclusig and Tasigna within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
Chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Phase (CP) Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia (CML) for Bosulif 
based on study AV001. In addition, the MAH updated the SmPC with safety and efficacy information 
from studies B1871006 and B1871008. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 
and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Moreover, the updated 
RMP version 4.1 was agreed during the procedure. Furthermore, the Annex IIIA is brought in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.

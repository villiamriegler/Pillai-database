2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Adalimumab, the active ingredient of Amsparity (also referred as adalimumab-Pfizer and PF-06410293) 
is a genetically engineered recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which 
binds specifically to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and neutralises its biological function by 
blocking interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates 
biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion 
molecules responsible for leukocyte migration. Adalimumab belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group 
“immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors” (ATC code: L04AB04).  
Amsparity has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Humira (adalimumab) 
according to Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC. All the indications labelled for the EU reference 
product are claimed for the current biosimilar product, i.e. treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA), active enthesitis-related arthritis, axial 
spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), adult and paediatric plaque psoriasis (PsO), adult and 
paediatric Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult and adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa 
(HS), adult and paediatric non-infectious uveitis (UV). 
Amsparity is presented as a 0.8 mL solution for injection, containing 40 mg adalimumab, in a single 
dose pre-filled syringe, pre-filled pen and vial to be administered via subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
Amsparity is also available as 0.4 mL single dose pre-filled syringe, containing 20 mg adalimumab, to 
be administered via SC injection. 
2.2.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application is an abridged application for a similar biological medicinal 
product under Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC.  
Similarity is claimed to Humira (adalimumab) as the reference medicinal product, which has been 
marketed in the European Union for over 10 years. Humira 40 mg solution for injection in a prefilled 
syringe was first authorised in the EU on 8 September 2003; the Marketing Authorisation Holder is 
AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG. 
For their development, the applicant has applied several guidelines. The most important guidance 
applied related to the guideline on similar biological medical products (CHMP/437/04 Rev.1), guideline 
on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies: non-clinical and clinical 
issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1). In addition to the aforementioned CHMP guidelines the 
applicant has complied in their development program also with the FDA guidelines to allow global 
development. 
The applicant received CHMP scientific advice for the product development on six occasions pertaining 
to the quality, non-clinical, and clinical development and one qualification advice on clinical 
comparative studies of biologic therapies in Rheumatoid Arthritis. The pivotal study and the 
development programme overall were compliant with CHMP guidance/scientific advice. 
The applicant has not applied for a PIP for the current development program, which is acceptable as 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 12/112 
 
 
 
 
this is a biosimilar medicinal product. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a single-use, sterile, preservative-free solution for administration 
via SC injection containing 40 mg of adalimumab as active substance in 0.8 mL. For paediatric use, the 
solution contains 20 mg of adalimumab as active substance in 0.4 mL. The final concentration is 50 
mg/mL.  
Other ingredients are: L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, disodium edetate 
dihydrate (EDTA), L-methionine, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
The product is available in four presentations: single use vial (type I glass), fitted with rubber 
stoppers, aluminium crimps and flip off seals; single use pre filled syringe (type I glass) with a rubber 
plunger stopper  and a needle with a needle shield  for adult and paediatric use; single use pre filled 
pen containing a pre filled syringe. The syringe inside the pen is made from type 1 glass with a rubber 
plunger stopper and a needle with a needle shield.  
Amsparity is developed as a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab, AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG). 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (INN: adalimumab, manufacturer’s code PF-06410293) is an IgG1 kappa 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells with two identical heavy 
(H) chains and two identical light (L) chains, covalently linked with four inter-chain disulfide bonds. The 
N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence, NST, in the CH2 region is essentially fully occupied with 
asialo, core-fucosylated, complex-type biantennary N-linked glycans with zero or one terminal 
galactose residue, abbreviated as G0F and G1F, respectively. The active substance is capable of 
binding to human TNF in a dose dependent manner and neutralizing its effects. TNF is a naturally 
occurring cytokine that promotes normal inflammatory and immune responses when bound to its 
receptor. However, overexpressed TNF-α has been implicated in numerous autoimmune diseases. 
Blocking the TNF receptors results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways leading to decreased 
cytokine release and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture and quality control (QC) testing of the active substance occurs at Wyeth BioPharma, 
Andover, MA, USA, which is authorized according to current GMP regulations.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Adalimumab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described.  The production 
cell line is a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. 
The manufacturing process for the active substance includes steps for fermentation, harvest, 
purification with a series of chromatography, viral inactivation/filtration and ultra-/diafiltration steps.

The formulated active substance is stored and transported under appropriate conditions. There are two 
possible reprocessing steps (the virus reduction filtration and final filtration). Reprocessing conditions 
are appropriately described. The manufacturing process, with process controls, has been clearly 
outlined in flow-diagrams. Overall, the manufacturing process has been adequately discussed in the 
dossier. The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with 
acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described for each step. 
Process parameters and controls have been appropriately presented and appropriate justification and 
clarification have been provided for the assignment of process parameters and their criticality. A 
detailed description of the container closure system is provided. Extractable/leachable and toxicological 
assessment studies have been performed to identify possible safety risks. The proposed container 
closure system is considered adequately qualified and suitable for storage of the active substance. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
provided. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No human or 
animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and acceptable 
documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell 
substrate. 
Recombinant CHO cells expressing the monoclonal antibody adalimumab were established by 
transfection of the expression vector followed by genetic selection. Generation and testing of the 
expression vectors were described. A two-tiered cell banking system for Master Cell Banks (MCB), WCB 
and end-of-production cells (EOP) is in place. The CHO-cells are well characterised and are established 
according to ICH Q5A, ICH Q5B and Q5D guidelines. The cell banks are tested to be free from 
adventitious agents. The limit of in vitro cell age is determined and genotypic and phenotypic stability 
of the recombinant cell line at the limit of cell age is demonstrated. A protocol is presented for the 
preparation, qualification and storage of renewal of working cell banks, thus no variation is expected 
when a new WCB is established.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The in-process controls, including process parameters and material attributes with acceptable ranges 
and in-process tests with control limits as well as the targets and normal operating ranges (NORs) for 
manufacturing of the active substance have been presented with their classification as critical or non-
critical.  
Overall, the presented process controls are deemed appropriate, and the Applicant has appropriately 
described the regulatory procedures (i.e. variation procedures) foreseen in case of changes introduced 
into IPTs. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. The overall control strategy is considered 
satisfactory and is clearly linked to critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Process validation 
The intended commercial manufacturing process for the adalimumab active substance has been 
validated at the intended commercial scale. The manufacturing process has been validated adequately, 
including removal of product- and process-related impurities, inactivation/removal of viral and 
adventitious agents, process intermediate hold time studies, chromatography column resin lifetime 
studies, UF/DF membrane re-use cycles, media and buffer hold time studies, reprocessing, and 
shipping qualification. Consistency in production has been shown on four independent full-scale 
batches. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria 
for the in-process tests were fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces

adalimumab active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined 
specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
The adalimumab active substance manufacturing process was developed using the Applicant’s 
preferred CHO host cell line and mAb cell culture and purification processes. The Applicant has 
employed the intended commercial process already at the earliest stages of development and all 
batches used for nonclinical and clinical studies were manufactured at the intended commercial launch 
site using the intended commercial process. Only minor changes) were introduced to the process 
during development to support consistency of the process. The implemented changes can be 
considered minor optimization to the process and the provided evidence on comparability of the 
processes is considered sufficient. 
Characterisation 
The adalimumab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of an IgG1-
type antibody. 
The  characterisation  of  adalimumab  active  substance  involved  determination  of  structure  (primary, 
secondary,  and  higher-order),  post-translational  modifications  (N-linked  glycans,  disulfide  bonds), 
charge variants, aggregation and fragmentation, and biological activity. These studies are discussed in 
the Section for Biosimilarity as the characterisation studies are also part of biosimilarity assessment. In 
order to better understand possible degradation pathways of the active substance forced degradation 
studies for the active substance and finished product were performed. In general, the studies included 
in  the  characterization  are  considered  relevant  and  comprehensive.  In  addition,  the  Applicant  has 
clarified  that  no  evidence  of  O-glycans  or  meaningful  levels  of  potentially  immunogenic  glycan 
structures was observed in the active substance. 
Specification 
The set of agreed specifications includes tests for appearance, protein concentration, identity, purity 
and impurities, biological activity and microbiological tests.  
All test parameters proposed to be included in the adalimumab active substance specification have 
been discussed separately and justification and historical data has been provided for each parameter. 
Overall, the test parameters proposed to be included in the adalimumab active substance specification 
are considered relevant and in line with current guidance.  
Most  of  the  tests  included  in  the  release  specification  are  also  part  of  the  shelf  life  specification.  No 
differences in the acceptance criteria are foreseen. 
Analytical methods 
Appropriate method descriptions have been provided for all analytical methods. In general, validation 
for all methods has been performed adequately following ICHQ2 (R1). All predetermined validation 
acceptance criteria were met and all methods were considered validated for their intended use. For 
microbiological testing validation results are presented and these meet the requirements set in the Ph. 
Eur. 
Batch analysis 
Batches of active substance used for development studies, nonclinical studies, clinical studies, stability, 
and produced during process validation have been appropriately listed. Batch analyses data was

provided for development batches, Clinical Inventory/ Stability Batches and Clinical Inventory/ Process 
Validation Batches. The results are all within the pre-defined specifications and confirm consistency of 
the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The reference standards used throughout the product development have been adequately described. 
The Applicant has established a two-tiered system for in-house reference material involving primary 
and working reference standards.  
The characterisation tests and analytical procedures for establishing a new WRM were provided.  
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed container when stored at the recommended storage condition. 
The stability program has been designed following relevant ICH guidelines. The analytical procedures 
used in the stability monitoring program have been validated and their stability indicating properties 
have been confirmed. Most attributes, test methods and acceptance criteria in the shelf-life 
specification are identical to those in the release specification.  
Real time stability data at long term conditions, stability data at accelerated conditions, and supportive 
stability data, were provided on an adequate number of batches.  The data indicate that there have 
been no significant changes in terms of quality, purity or potency for the active substance when stored 
at the long term and accelerated conditions.  All results were within the acceptance criteria.   
Testing under stressed conditions (thermal stress and photostability stress) were also completed.  The 
Applicant has demonstrated that the product is photolabile. The applicant has committed to complete 
the ongoing stability studies according to the submitted protocol. Any confirmed out-of-specification 
result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA

AI) 40 mg/0.8 mL. The PFP encloses an Amsparity 40 mg/0.8 mL PFS.  
The finished product does not contain any overages. Each prefilled syringe contains an overfill to 
assure the nominal dose is delivered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 16/112 
 
 
 
 
All excipients are established pharmaceutical ingredients of compendial grade, and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation.   
Pharmaceutical development 
The intent of adalimumab finished product development was to obtain a product that is both 
pharmaceutically acceptable and highly similar to the reference adalimumab product on a global basis. 
As there are five presentations of the reference adalimumab product available across various regions, 
this involved developing a single active substance that could be used to manufacture any of the 
finished products: 10, 20, 40 mg PFS, 40 mg vial and a 40 mg PFP. The formulation development 
program evaluated the active substance in multiple buffer and pH conditions and evaluated additional 
excipients to determine if the excipients are effectively stabilizing the active substance. The 
formulation development has been presented in detail, and the differences in the chosen formulation in 
respect to the originator have been presented. 
The manufacturing process development has been described in detail. All finished product 
presentations have been manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing facility and scale for 
the entirety of the clinical development program. The formulation composition and protein 
concentration have remained the same throughout development for all presentations. The 40 mg 
prefilled syringe manufactured at the intended commercial scale was used in clinical studies, along with 
the 40 mg prefilled pen. 
The primary packaging is: a) single-use vial (type I glass), fitted with rubber stoppers, aluminium 
crimps and flip-off seals; b) single-use pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with a plunger stopper  and a 
needle with a needle shield; c) single-use pre-filled pen containing a pre-filled syringe. The syringe 
inside the pen is made from type 1 glass with a plunger stopper and a needle with a needle shield. The 
primary packaging materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure systems has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
The finished product PFP is defined as a medicinal product under Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, 
as the device component forms a single integral product intended exclusively for use in combination 
with the PFS. Design changes to the pen and instructions for use (IFU) made during development have 
been presented. The Applicant presents evidence that retesting of finished product quality attributes 
for the finished product PFP release and PFP stability studies is not required when the testing is already 
performed on the corresponding PFS component of the PFP. This is considered acceptable. 
Quality attributes relevant to the finished product were assessed using risk management principles for 
criticality for the finished product quality and for relevance to similarity within the context of the 
finished product target for development.  
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was developed, including the product attributes relevant to 
similarity and expectations for pharmaceutical acceptability. The QTPP describes the finished product in 
terms of quality characteristics to be achieved at the end of the manufacturing process. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process has been satisfactorily described. It is a non-standard 
aseptic process normally associated with biological product manufacture. Manufacture includes 
formulation and fill finish activities. The material is sterile filtered, filled and sealed. has been 
satisfactorily described.

EMA/2756/2020  
Page 17/112 
 
 
 
 
Clear step-by-step descriptions and flow charts of the Amsparity finished product manufacturing 
processes including IPCs were provided for all presentations and are considered appropriate overall. 
The finished product PFP is manufactured using the PFS 40 mg. The intended manufacturing activities 
used to produce the final finished product PFP are simple assembly operations similar to existing 
processes for other pen delivery systems and are designed to ensure no impact to the PFS container 
closure integrity. The description of PFP manufacturing process is appropriate. 
Finished product manufacturing process controls and control limits for relevant manufacturing steps. 
The finished product (vial and PFS presentations) manufacturing process has been validated. The 
validation studies for the vial and PFS presentations included: manufacturing process validation, hold 
times validation, aseptic filling procedure validation and shipping validation. . Overall, the finished 
product manufacturing process can be considered successfully validated and it can be concluded that it 
is capable of consistently producing sterile finished product as demonstrated by the manufacture of full 
scale finished product lots, all meeting the established acceptance criteria. 
The validation studies for Amsparity PFP included process validation and shipping validation. The PV 
lots met the predetermined protocol acceptance criteria demonstrating that the assembly process 
produces Amsparity PFPs of consistent quality. Sufficient information of the PFP process validation has 
been provided. 
Product specification 
The specifications for Amsparity vials, PFS and PFP for intended commercial batch release include 
compendial and non-compendial assays: appearance, protein concentration, identity tests, purity and 
impurity tests, biological activity and other general tests.    
The non-compendial analytical procedures used for batch release and stability studies, are largely 
common to both the active substance and finished product and have been described and discussed. 
Overall, the batch data and justification of specification support the proposed acceptance criteria set 
for the specifications. The proposed specifications for Amsparity PFP include demonstrating appropriate 
functional performance. The batch data supports the proposed acceptance criteria set for the 
specifications. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on batches of the finished product at the intended commercial scale, and including 
clinical batches, were provided for all presentations. The results are within specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference materials used for analysis of Amsparity finished product are the same as those used for 
the active substance. 
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data for the PFS and vial a proposed shelf-life of 36 months, when stored 
protected from light, at the recommended temperature of 2 to 8 °C as stated in the SmPC is 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 18/112 
 
 
 
 
acceptable. Similarly, on the basis of the available stability data for the PFP, a proposed shelf-life of 36 
months when stored at 2 to 8 °C for the PFP is agreed. 
A single Amsparity pre-filled syringe / pre-filled pen / vial may be stored at temperatures up to a 
maximum of 30°C for a period of up to 30 days. The pre-filled syringe / pre-filled pen / vial must be 
protected from light and discarded if not used within the 30-day period.  This is supported by the 
accelerated and thermal cycling stability data provided. 
The stability program has been designed following relevant ICH guidelines. The analytical procedures 
used in the stability monitoring program have been validated and their stability indicating properties 
have been confirmed. The parameters tested are largely the same as for release.  
Real-time/real condition stability data, accelerated stability data and thermal stress study data were 
provided. 
The Applicant has provided data that indicate that the product is photolabile. The Applicant has 
demonstrated that the design of the PFP, its final assembly, labelling and packaging processes, have 
no impact on the PFS and finished product quality. Therefore, the results and conclusions from the 
stability studies on the PFS are considered applicable to the quality of the finished product when stored 
in the PFP and used to set the overall shelf life claim of the PFP itself.  
The applicant has committed to complete the ongoing stability studies according to the submitted 
protocol.  In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or 
significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

Adventitious agents 
The Applicant has addressed both non-viral and viral contaminants. 
In the intended commercial manufacturing process no material from animal or human origin is used 
and hence the risk of TSE contamination from the raw materials used is considered to be negligible. 
The CHO cell line used for the production is well characterised. MCB, WCB and EPC have been 
characterised for the absence of contaminating viruses according to ICHQ5A and CPMP/BWP/268/95. 
Tests for viruses as well as sterility and mycoplasma have been conducted for the cell banks. A virus 
validation study was performed according to CPMP/BWP/268/95. Viruses for the clearance studies can 
be considered to represent a wide range of physico-chemical properties that demonstrates the ability 
of the system to eliminate viruses in general.

versus Humira (EU) and Humira (US). The evaluation of the analytical biosimilarity is based on the 
comparison with Humira (EU) batches.  
Comparability criteria 
Statistical analysis was applied to attributes with moderate to very high level of potential impact to 
support assessment of results, and generally included assays that evaluate clinically relevant 
mechanism(s) of action (MoA) of the product for each indication for which approval is sought and 
attributes that could impact these MoA.  
Method qualification 
Descriptions of analytical methods data have been provided for all methods used for characterisation of 
the biosimilar product. Validation data is provided for the methods used also for routine release 
testing. In addition, qualification reports for biological assays have been provided. In general, the 
assays are qualified for accuracy, intermediate precision, linearity, and range. In addition, some of the 
assays have been qualified for specificity, and the controls used are appropriate.

Critical evaluation of analytical biosimilarity 
On the quality level, a comprehensive biosimilarity exercise has been performed following the general 
principles outlined in the guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance; Quality issues (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012). The 
comparability exercise is mostly based on comparison of analytical characterization data collected 
during the years of pharmaceutical development. For most quality attributes, a high degree of 
similarity has been demonstrated. 
A high degree of similarity between Amsparity and Humira-EU can be demonstrated using the following 
quality attributes: 
- 
Primary structure 
-  Higher order structure 
-  Dimers, aggregations, and fragments 
-  Glycosylation, with the exception of total afucosylation/high mannose variants 
-  Charge variant profile 
-  Binding to both sTNF and mTNF 
-  C1q binding and CDC activity. 
For the following quality attributes minor differences between Amsparity and Humira-EU are not 
expected to have significant clinical impact, however further justification and/or control was requested: 
- 
The levels of high mannose variants differ. Based on Applicant’s discussion and previous 
knowledge on other anti-TNF antibodies, it was agreed that the minor difference between 
Amsparity and Humira-EU high mannose levels is not expected to have clinical impact. 
- 
Lower level of ADCC function correlating with lower levels of total afucosylation. This trend was 
not as visible in the assays that are most representative of the physical situation.

- 
In addition to discussion on the structure function relationships, new data on ADCC activity has 
been provided during the procedure. ADCC PBMC assay was performed on the V/V high affinity 
binding genotype. A similar trend of lower ADCC activity was observed with healthy donor 
PBMC V/V cells. Mostly the results are overlapping and can be accepted.  
In addition, an ADCC assay was performed also on IBD patient donor cells and the results are 
discussed in the non-clinical section. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The data provided support biosimilarity versus the EU reference medicinal product (Humira (EU)) at 
the quality level. In addition, the non-EU comparator (Humira (US)) used in pivotal clinical trials has 
been shown to be representative of the EU reference medicinal product. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Adalimumab used in the nonclinical studies was produced using the intended manufacturing process at 
the intended commercial sites and scale and represents the intended commercial product. Humira-EU 
40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection was used as a reference product. In addition, Humira-US has been 
used in the studies for the globally harmonised development purposes. 
The nonclinical studies comprised the comparative battery of in vitro analyses of biological activity and 
a GLP-compliant 1-month repeated dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys. The 
nonclinical  in  vivo  testing  strategy  was  designed  to  meet  the  requirements  for  a  global  development 
strategy. 
The nonclinical development of Amsparity (PF-06410293, adalimumab-Pfizer)  was done in accordance 
with the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies: non-
clinical and clinical issues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and the “Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and 
clinical issues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1).

2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Adalimumab is a recombinant fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
which binds to TNF and inhibits its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, thereby 
neutralising the effect of TNF found in inflammatory conditions.  
It is an IgG1 kappa antibody that binds, via the variable region complementarity determining regions, 
to both soluble TNF (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (mTNF) with high avidity. The primary mechanism 
of action is binding of the fragment antigen binding (Fab) domain of adalimumab to sTNF. This results 
in disruption of TNF ligand-receptor signalling and inflammatory cascade, with downstream down-
regulation of adhesion molecule expression and a reduction of inflammatory cell infiltration. This 
mechanism of action is applicable across all disease indications.  
To support the biosimilarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and the reference product Humira-EU (but 
also Humira-US), the in vitro pharmacology of adalimumab-Pfizer was assessed with respect to its Fab 
and fragment crystallizable (fc)-based biological activity in a number of functional and binding assays. 
The in vitro functional characterisation data are summarised in Table 1. The Fab-related functions 
including inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis and endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) 
expression, binding to soluble and membrane bound TNFα, and reverse signalling indicate similar 
activity of Amsparity and Humira-EU (and Humira-US). Fc-related functions were comparatively 
assessed by ADCC and CDC assays and complemented with binding assays for the FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, 
FcγRIIIa and b, FcRn and C1q. The binding and functional activity was similar for Amsparity and 
Humira-EU in regards of the binding to FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIb, FcRn and C1q, and CDC activity. In 
addition, Amsparity and Humira-EU showed similar inhibition of T-cell proliferation regardless of 
FcγRIIIa genotype of PBMCs. 
Therefore, results from these assays demonstrated that adalimumab-Pfizer was similar to Humira-EU 
(and also Humira-US).  
Stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were not conducted and are not required. Cardiovascular 
endpoints and respiration rate were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys in the repeat dose toxicity 
study with adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. There were no treatment-related changes. 
In vivo pharmacodynamics, secondary pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
studies were not conducted and are not required. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative toxicokinetic data were obtained from a 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys receiving weekly SC dosing of 157 mg/kg of PF-06410293 or Humira-EU (see 
toxicology section 2.4.4. below).  
The absence of studies evaluating the distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions is consistent with CHMP guidance (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies, EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicokinetic (TK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) evaluations in male and female cynomolgus monkeys 
were conducted in support of a 1-month SC repeat-dose toxicity study with adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 25/112 
 
 
 
 
Animals received a weekly SC dose of 157 mg/kg of PF-06410293 or Humira-EU and respective 
vehicles. Dose selection was based on the high dose used for the 4-week study in cynomolgus 
monkeys for the reference product Humira. The adalimumab active substance used in the toxicity 
study was manufactured using the same process that is intended for market supply and is therefore 
representative of the intended final manufacturing process. 
Comparable safety profile was demonstrated. Microscopic findings in the spleen consisted of minimally 
decreased cellularity of lymphoid follicles and germinal centers, which corresponded with 
immunohistochemistry findings of decreased CD21, IgG, and IgM positive cells. These findings were 
similar in incidence and severity in PF-06410293 and Humira-EU treated animals, and were consistent 
with previously reported expected pharmacologic activity of adalimumab in cynomolgus monkeys. The 
TK profiles were comparable, but there was a tendency for higher exposures (AUC168 and Cmax) in 
animals treated with PF-06410293 in comparison to Humira-EU on day 22. The exposures were 
approximately 1.2–fold higher in PF-06410293 treated animals. The low number of animals/group is 
however limiting the value of the study to draw further conclusions.  
Adalimumab-Pfizer did not elicit anti-drug antibody formation in treated monkeys. One ADA-positive 
animal was reported in the Humira-EU treated group. The analytical methods (ELISA) employed for 
determination of adalimumab concentration in the cynomolgus monkey serum were sufficiently 
validated. However, the ECL assay for determination of anti-adalimumab antibodies in the monkey 
samples may have underestimated the ADA positivity due to the drug interference and may not have 
fitted the purpose. Consequently, the data do not allow drawing conclusions on the similarity or 
dissimilarity of PF-06410293 and Humira-EU on triggering the ADA formation in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Overall, these differences did not affect the safety profile of PF-06410293 in comparison to Humira-EU 
Nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies were not 
conducted as these are not warranted when the proposed product and the reference product have 
been demonstrated to be highly similar through extensive structural and functional characterization 
and animal toxicity studies. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) consisted in a justification for not submitting ERA studies. 
The active substance is a natural substance, a protein, the use of which will not alter the concentration 
or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, adalimumab is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of Assessment report EMA/CHMP/559383/2017 Page 25/111 medicinal products for human 
use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The characterisation studies of Fab-related functions indicate similar activity for Amsparity and Humira-
EU. However, there were some differences observed in the antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in primary NK-cells. Although the ADCC activity effector functions are not 
considered to play a major role in the functionality of adalimumab, triggering of the ADCC can be 
mediated by the membrane bound TNF. There were some analytical differences observed in the high 
mannose content and afucosylated species between the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. Lower 
afucosylated species content range was reported in adalimumab-Pfizer in comparison to Humira EU. In 
the comparative ADCC study in primary NK cells (high affinity genotype) the adalimumab-Pfizer lots 
were located in the lower activity range of the reference product, and the Humira-EU to the upper 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 26/112 
 
 
 
 
range. This could be interpreted that adalimumab-Pfizer triggered less ADCC response in primary NK 
cells than Humira-EU. Further ADCC assays were conducted in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs). These studies indicated similar ADCC activity in PBMCs, which in general could be considered 
more representative of physiological condition but is also less sensitive than the studies in NK-cells. 
The reporter gene assay (RGA-assay) was employed using stable Jurkat cell line expressing FcγRIIIa 
for analysing the similarity of triggering the early steps of ADCC pathway. In this study, adalimumab-
Pfizer and Humira-EU can be considered similar in regards of triggering the early steps in ADCC 
pathway. There were also small differences in the FcγRIIIa –binding activities but these were not in line 
with the ADCC activity findings. 
In order to test the potential functional effects of differences noted in high mannose N-glycan content 
between the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU, cellular uptake of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-US 
into rat alveolar macrophages was investigated in the absence and presence of mannan. It has been 
reported that therapeutic IgGs containing high-mannose glycans in the Fc region are cleared more 
rapidly in humans than other glycan forms. The differences in high mannose glycan species could in 
principle impact pharmacokinetics via differential clearance through binding to mannose-binding 
receptors and ADCC function through binding to FcγRIIIa. However, the uptake was similar for 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-US. The excess mannan did not significantly inhibit the adalimumab-
Pfizer or Humira-US uptake to the rat alveolar macrophages, and it was concluded that the mannose 
receptor was not the major receptor mediating the adalimumab cellular uptake. However, the 
relevance of the assay for characterisation of potential functional effects of high mannose N-glycan 
content differences in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU is considered low. 
In conclusion, the functional characterisation studies implicated similar Fab-related activities for 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU, and revealed some differences in the ADCC effector functions in 
primary NK-cells. In light of the pharmacokinetic differences seen between adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU during the evaluation, the difference in high mannose variant and total afucosylation levels 
needed further discussion. The applicant was asked to further discuss the clinical impact of the 
observed differences in the ADCC activity and total afucosylation species content and high mannose 
variants between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU to serve as part of the scientific justification for 
extrapolation for the IBD indications, for which, the effector functions are plausible mechanisms of 
action of adalimumab. This question overlapped with Quality concerns. In their response, the applicant 
provided data from the in vitro ADCC PBMC assay comparing the adalimumab-Pfizer, Humira-US and 
Humira-EU activity using effector cells from IBD-patient donors.  
Quantitative comparison of the results could not be done due to the low signal to noise ratio (possibly 
related to the lowered ADCC response of the IBD-patient donor cells). However, no meaningful 
differences between the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU (or Humira-US) in triggering the ADCC 
response in the IBD patient cells was noted. The clinical impact of high mannose content on the PK was 
clarified and is expected to be minor. It was estimated (extrapolation of the Goetze experimental data) 
that the decrease in the AUC for the Humira-EU and Humira-US would range from 2.1 – 2.3%, while 
the decrease for adalimumab-Pfizer would be ~0.4%. Thus, it can be concluded that the differences in 
high mannose, and its impact on the PK of adalimumab, is not expected to be significant. 
In conclusion, from the nonclinical point of view, the clinical impact of the observed differences in the 
ADCC activity and total afucosylation level and high mannose variants between adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU is solved. 
There was a tendency for higher exposures (1.2 –fold higher AUC168 and Cmax) in animals treated 
with adalimumab-Pfizer in comparison to Humira-EU on day 22. The low number of animals / groups is 
however limiting the value of the study to draw further conclusions. Furthermore, these differences did 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 27/112 
 
 
 
 
not affect the safety profile of adalimumab-Pfizer in comparison to Humira-EU. Comparable safety 
profile was demonstrated. 
The assay for determination of anti-adalimumab antibodies may not have fitted the purpose and may 
have underestimated the ADA positivity due to drug interference in the monkey serum samples. 
Consequently, the data do not allow drawing conclusions on the similarity or dissimilarity of 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU on triggering the ADA formation in cynomolgus monkeys. However, 
this is not further pursued from the nonclinical side taking into consideration the small number of 
animals in the study and comparable safety characteristics. The pharmacokinetics has been evaluated 
in patients in the biosimilarity programme (see Clinical aspects 2.5. ). 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
During the evaluation, no major objections were identified in the nonclinical part of the dossier. The 
applicant clarified the differences identified in the high mannose and afucosylation levels, which could 
possibly reflect differences in the ADCC activity (as tested in the NK cells) and justify the lack of impact 
in extrapolation to all indications (e.g. IBD). It could be concluded, that there were no meaningful 
differences between the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU (or Humira-US) in triggering the ADCC 
response in the IBD patient cells. The clinical impact of high mannose content on the PK was clarified 
and is expected be minor. 
In conclusion, the available non-clinical data support the biosimilarity between Amsparity and the 
Humira-EU.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity profiles of adalimumab-Pfizer were investigated in four 
clinical studies: 2 single-dose subcutaneous (SC) PK similarity studies in healthy subjects, 1 single SC 
dose PK comparability study using a prefilled syringe (PFS) or a prefilled pen (PFP) in healthy subjects, 
and 1 multi-dose clinical comparability study in subjects with moderately to severely active RA, which 
included an optional device substudy using a PFP. 
Analytical methods 
The methodologies used in the analysis of biological samples for the detection of drug concentrations 
(PK), antidrug antibodies (ADAs), and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) were fully validated. Furthermore, 
the respective assays were designed and conducted in accordance with regulatory guidance. 
The following analytical methods were used: ELISA for the determination of adalimumab 
concentrations in human serum, Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay for the detection of 
ADA and a cell-based immunogenicity assay for the detection of Nab against adalimumab in human 
serum from healthy subjects and RA patients. 
The adalimumab concentration in the serum was determined by a validated ELISA method. In this 
assay, adalimumab is captured by a recombinant human TNF-α and an HRP-conjugated goat anti-
human IgG antibody is used to detect the bound analyte. The use of Humira-EU as a reference 
standard for calibration curve preparation can be agreed as the analytical similarity from three full 
standard curves independently prepared from adalimumab-Pfizer, Humira-EU, and Humira-US was 
demonstrated. The same analytical method was used for the determination of adalimumab in the 
serum from healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is acceptable as the 
method demonstrated also selectivity for RA serum.  
The validated ADA method is an ECL immunoassay based on MSD technology using a ruthenium (Ru) 
metal chelate as the ECL label. Affinity purified human monoclonal anti-adalimumab antibody was used 
as a positive control. All serum samples were screened in Tier 1 to detect the presence of binding 
antibodies to adalimumab. Tier 1 positive samples were analysed to confirm specificity of the response 
in Tier 2. Tier 2 positive samples proceeded with End Point Tier analysis (EPT Tier 3). Two methods 
were validated: B5387005 (using biotin and ruthenium labelled adalimumab-Pfizer) and B5387006 
(using biotin and ruthenium labelled Humira-EU). A one-assay approach, using labelled adalimumab-
Pfizer, was chosen for subsequent studies due to high cross-reactivity (>95%) for ADA-positive 
samples between the two assay methods observed in study B5381001. This is agreed. Following 
request on positive controls, the applicant has presented additional method development data. The 
positive controls used are suitable to monitor assay performance. No matrix interference was observed 
using normal or RA serum. The absence of interference by lipemic or haemolysed plasma samples was 
also demonstrated.  
The validated cell-based method was used for the evaluation of neutralising capacity of antibodies 
present in ADA-positive samples. Two methods were validated: B5387002 (detection of neutralising 
anti-adalimumab-Pfizer antibodies using adalimumab-Pfizer) and B5387004 (detection of neutralising 
anti-Humira-EU antibodies using Humira-EU). A one-assay approach, using adalimumab-Pfizer, was 
chosen for subsequent studies due to high cross-reactivity (>95%) for NAb-positive samples between 
the two assay methods observed in study B5381001. The drug tolerance of the assay has been 
adequately discussed and justified by the applicant.  
Overall, the analytical methods used in each study were validated in line with the EMA bioanalytical 
method validation guidelines.

Clinical study B5381001 in healthy subjects  
The study was a double-blind (Sponsor-open), randomised (1:1:1), parallel group, 3-arm, single-dose, 
PK  similarity  study  of  adalimumab-Pfizer  and  adalimumab  sourced  from  the  US  and  EU  administered 
SC in the lower abdomen by a PFS to healthy adult subjects.  
The objectives of the study were: 
•  To compare the PK of adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU, and adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-US 
(primary objective). 
•  To compare the PK of Humira-EU to Humira-US. 
•  To evaluate the single-dose safety and tolerability. 
•  To evaluate the immunogenicity. 
The test product was adalimumab-Pfizer (40 mg of adalimumab in a PFS; open label supply) and the 
reference/comparator products were Humira-EU (40 mg of adalimumab in a PFS) and Humira-US (40 
mg of adalimumab in a PFS). 
A total of 210 healthy subjects (209 males, 1 post-menopausal female; aged 18-54 years; BMI 17.5 to 
30.5 kg/m2) were randomised to 1 of the 3 study treatment groups. The demographic data were 
generally comparable in the studied treatment groups. Sixty-nine (69) subjects received adalimumab–
Pfizer, 70 subjects received Humira-EU and 71 subjects received Humira-US. Two (2) subjects 
discontinued from the study due to withdrawal by subject (1 subject in the adalimumab-Pfizer group 
and 1 subject in Humira-EU group). The discontinued subject in the Humira-EU group was still 
evaluable in the PK population. Eleven (11) subjects were excluded from the primary PK analysis 
(3 subjects in the adalimumab-Pfizer group, 4 subjects in the Humira-US group, and 4 subjects in the 
Humira-EU group). 
Of these 11 subjects, 2 subjects were excluded because the measured serum concentration of 
adalimumab in the pre-dose sample was greater than 5% of the Cmax for each of the subjects. The 
study was a parallel group study in healthy subjects. Consequently, clarification was needed for the 
high adalimumab concentrations in pre-dose samples. The applicant tried to find the reason for the 
pre-dose adalimumab concentrations > 5% of the Cmax; however, no reason could be found. The 
amount of subjects having the high pre-dose adalimumab concentrations was small and the subjects 
were in different study groups, so it can be considered that the exclusion of these subjects from the 
primary PK analysis did not affect the results. An additional 9 subjects were excluded because their PK 
profiles exhibited an insufficient terminal phase, due to missing concentrations at later time points (PK 
samples were not collected at these time points) or because of the impact of ADA on the terminal 
phase. For each subject, the terminal phase was considered sufficient if the profile showed: 1) 
measurable concentrations to at least the 504-hour time point; and 2) measurable concentrations at a 
minimum of 3 time points after the observed Tmax. 
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at 0 (pre-dose), and at 3, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 
168, 192, 264, 336 (= 2 weeks), 504, 672, 840, 1008 h (i.e. 42 days/6 weeks) post-dose. Blood 
samples were collected for determination of ADA and NAbs to adalimumab at day 1 (pre-dose), day 
15, day 29, day 43, day 71 and at extended follow-up. The applicant was advised by the CHMP that 
the sampling time period should be extended to at least 10 weeks; however, the advice was not 
followed. Consequently, there existed almost 50% of subjects (N =39 [59%] in the adalimumab-Pfizer 
group, N = 30 [45%] in the Humira-EU group and n =25 [37%] in the Humira-US group), whose AUCt 
did not cover at least 80% of AUCinf (i.e. the late elimination phase of the PK profile was not optimally 
characterised). 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 34/112 
 
 
 
 
The PK parameters included: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-2wk, and AUCt; primary PK parameters were not pre-
specified in the protocol. In addition, if data permitted, AUCinf, CL/F, Vz/F and t½ were also estimated. 
The PK parameters were summarised using descriptive statistics according to treatment group. A one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as a factor was performed for each natural log 
transformed PK parameter (AUC0-2wk, AUCt, AUCinf or Cmax). PK similarity for a given test-to-reference 
comparison was considered demonstrated if the 90% CIs for the test-to-reference ratios of Cmax, AUCt, 
and AUCinf fell within the 80.00% to 125.00% bioequivalence window. 
Exploratory analysis was performed to examine the relationship between weight and PK parameters. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as factor and baseline weight as covariate was used 
for this analysis. The 90% CI between 2 treatment groups was constructed for Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt, 
and AUCinf in the same way as ANOVA. 
Additional exploratory PK analysis was planned for assessing potential effects of ADA at low drug 
concentrations at 1680 hours; however, due to the high rate of ADA observed, and the small number 
of subjects (n = 16-25/group) with measurable concentrations at 1680 hours, there were insufficient 
data to perform the analysis. Descriptive summary of PK parameters (day71) is, however, presented 
and the results are in accordance with other PK results (i.e. the Cmax and AUCs with adalimumab-Pfizer 
are slightly higher than with Humira). 
PK results 
The shape of concentration profiles for the test and the reference products can be considered similar; 
however, the median concentrations from 48-hour post dose until the end of the sampling period were 
higher in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the reference/comparator product groups (Figure 1).

Consistent with the median concentration-time profiles, the mean Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt and AUCinf 
estimates were slightly higher for adalimumab-Pfizer than for Humira-EU and Humira-US. The inter-
subject variability for each of the PK parameters was similar across the 3 study drugs, with %CV 
values of 30% to 31% for Cmax, 31% to 32% for AUC0-2wk, 30% to 33% for AUCt, and 39% to 43% for 
AUCinf (Table 3).

a. Tmax is reported as median. 
The PK similarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU (and also between adalimumab-Pfizer 
and Humira-US) was demonstrated in Cmax and AUC0-2wk; however, in AUCt and AUCinf the PK similarity 
was not formally met (Table 4). Exposure to adalimumab (in terms of mean AUCs and Cmax) was 
numerically systemically higher in adalimumab-Pfizer treatment group than in Humira-EU and Humira-
US. The test-to-reference ratios of adjusted means in all exposure indicating parameters were above 
100% and the 90% CIs for the test-to-reference of AUCs exclude 100% (the 90% CI adalimumab-
Pfizer 100.1-127.8% vs Humira-EU, 109.8-140.1% vs Humira-US).

a. The ratios (and 90% CIs) are expressed as percentages. 
In the exploratory analysis, in which the weight was used as a covariate, the point estimates for AUCs 
and Cmax were still above 100%; however, the 90% CIs for the Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt and AUCinf were 
within 80.00-125.00% (including 100.00%) in comparison of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. In 
the comparison of AUCs between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-US and Humira-EU and Humira–US, 
the 90% CIs were all above 100% (the upper limit being even > 125.00%). 
The percentage of ADA was high (85.5% in the adalimumab-Pfizer and 90% in Humira-EU; see section 
2.7. Clinical safety). Differences in the percentage of ADA and NAb, and onset ADA formation time 
between studied products were thought by the applicant to contribute to the failure of the AUCt to 
meet the PK similarity criteria. ADA formation against adalimumab is known to be accompanied by 
increased clearance and reduced exposure (and possible loss of efficacy) and in this study, the mean 
apparent clearance (CL/F) values were slightly higher and AUCs were slightly lower with Humira-EU 
and Humira-US than with Amsparity. 
Clinical study B5381007 in healthy subjects  
This study was a double-blind (Sponsor-open), randomised (1:1:1), parallel-group, 3-arm, single-
dose, definitive PK similarity study of adalimumab-Pfizer and adalimumab sourced from the US and EU 
administered SC in the lower abdomen by a PFS to healthy adult subjects.  
This study was performed because PK comparability between Amsparity and Humira-EU could not be 
unambiguously shown in study B5381001. Scientific advice was received from CHMP. CHMP considered 
that another single-dose study in healthy subjects will add some evidence to the question on whether 
differences in immunogenicity and PK measures in the study B5381001 were real, or a play of chance. 
This study was designed based on observed data from the clinical study B5381001. Table 5 shows the 
main study design differences between studies B5381001 and B5381007.

The study design of B5381007 was improved by increasing sample size, the PK sampling period was 
extended to 49 days (being still too short), the randomisation was stratified by 3 weight categories and 
the heterogeneity was reduced by narrowing age and weight ranges.  
Primary objective was to compare the PK of adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU, and of adalimumab-
Pfizer to Humira-US. 
Secondary objectives were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the PK of Humira-EU to Humira-US. 
To evaluate the single-dose safety and tolerability. 
To evaluate immunogenicity. 
The test product was adalimumab-Pfizer (40 mg of adalimumab in a PFS) and the 
reference/comparator products were Humira-EU (40 mg of adalimumab in a PFS) and Humira-US 
(40 mg of adalimumab in a PFS).  
A total of 362 healthy subjects were randomised to 1 of the 3 study treatment groups. The number of 
subjects who received the study drugs was 359 (226 males and 133 females; aged between 18-45 
years; BMI 19.5-30.5 kg/m2). One hundred and twenty-one (121) subjects received adalimumab–
Pfizer, 119 subjects received Humira-EU and 119 subjects received Humira-US. Three (3) subjects in 
the Humira-US group were randomised but did not receive any study treatment. Following dosing, 
19 subjects discontinued before the end of the study, including 5 subjects in the adalimumab-Pfizer 
group and 7 subjects in both the Humira-US group and the Humira-EU group. Forty-eight (48) dosed 
subjects were excluded from the primary PK analysis (15 subjects in the adalimumab-Pfizer group, 
18 subjects in the Humira-US group, and 15 subjects in the Humira-EU group). There were 4 subjects 
excluded from the primary PK analysis, because the serum drug concentration in the pre-dose sample 
was >5% of the Cmax. The study was parallel group study in healthy subjects. Consequently, 
clarification was needed for the high adalimumab concentrations in pre-dose samples. The applicant 
tried to find the reason for the pre-dose adalimumab concentrations > 5% of the Cmax; however, no 
reason could be found. The number of subjects having the high pre-dose adalimumab concentrations 
was small and the subjects were in different study groups, so it can be considered that the exclusion of 
these subjects from the primary PK analysis did not affect the results.

Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at 0 (pre-dose), and at 3, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 
168, 192, 264, 336 (= 2 weeks), 504, 672, 840, 1008 and 1176 h (i.e. 50 days/~ 7 weeks) post-dose. 
Blood samples were collected for determination of ADA and NAbs to adalimumab at day 1 (pre-dose), 
day 15, day 29, day 43, day 50 and 71 and at follow-up.  
The primary PK parameters included: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-2wk, and AUCt. In addition, if data permitted, 
AUCinf, CL/F, Vz/F and t½ were also estimated. The statistical methods and analyses were the same as 
in the study B5381001 (except the exploratory analysis using weight as a covariate, see above). 
PK Results: 
Among the 359 subjects receiving the assigned study drug, 311 (106 in adalimumab-Pfizer, 101 in 
Humira-US and 104 in Humira-EU) met the PP criteria and were eligible for the primary analysis for the 
PK similarity determination. 
The 3 study drugs exhibited a comparable PK profile, which was characterised by an increase of serum 
drug concentration following SC dosing, with the maximum serum concentration achieved after 
approximately 5-6 days, followed by a multi-phasic decline in drug concentrations (Figure 2).

A descriptive summary of PK parameters for adalimumab-Pfizer, Humira-US and Humira-EU is 
presented in Table 6. The mean Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt and AUCinf estimates were similar among the 3 
study drugs, with estimates of these parameters for adalimumab-Pfizer being slightly higher. 
The inter-subject variability for each of the PK parameters, though considerable, was similar across the 
3 study drugs, with %CV values of 28-29%, 26-29%, 29-33%, and 33-40% for Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt 
and AUCinf, respectively.

Consistent with the serum drug concentration-time profiles and the PK parameter summary statistics, 
the mean numerical values in all exposure indicating PK parameters (i.e. Cmax, AUCs) were slightly 
higher in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the Humira-EU and Humira-US group (Table 7). All 90% 
CIs for test-to-reference ratios of Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt and AUCinf were within the pre-specified

acceptance window of 80.00% to 125.00% (in comparison of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU). The 
biggest differences were in the Cmax and AUC0-2wk values, in which, the 90% CIs for test-to-reference 
ratios did not include 100%, but were above 100%. There existed many subjects, whose AUCt did not 
cover at least 80% of AUCinf; however, the amount of these subjects (N = 23 [22%] in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer group, N =34 [33%] in the Humira-EU group and N = 22 [22%] in the Humira-US 
group i.e. total amount > 20%) was smaller than in the study B5381001 (almost 50%). The secondary 
PK endpoints were quite comparable across treatment groups. 
The similarity in PK between Humira-EU and Humira-US was demonstrated. The 90% CIs for the 
primary PK parameters were all within 80.00-125.00% (including 100.00%).

In the study B5381007, the percentage of ADAs/NAbs in the adalimumab-Pfizer group was higher than 
in the Humira-EU group indicating that the Applicant’s argument that adalimumab-Pfizer may be less 
immunogenic (on the basis of the ADA/NAb results in the study B5381001 and B5381007) is not fully 
confirmed (see the details of ADA/NAb results in relation to PK from section 2.7. Clinical safety). 
However, it is accepted, that seemingly lower immunogenicity in the 2 studies (in the failed PK study 
and the study in RA patients) plays some role in the slightly higher exposures seen in adalimumab-
Pfizer group. 
Clinical study B5381005 in health subjects (PFS compared to PFP) 
This study was a randomised, open-label, single-dose, parallel group, 2-arm, phase I comparability 
study to assess the PK of adalimumab-Pfizer following SC administration using a PFS or a PFP in 
healthy adult subjects.  
Primary objective was to compare the single-dose PK of adalimumab-Pfizer administered SC with a 
pre-filled pen (PFP) device as compared to that of the pre-filled syringe (PFS), in healthy adult 
subjects. 
Secondary objectives were: 
•  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of adalimumab-Pfizer administered with the PFP device 
compared to the PFS. 
•  To evaluate the full PK profile following a single-dose of adalimumab-Pfizer administered with 
the PFP device and the PFS.

EMA/2756/2020

Exploratory objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of adalimumab administered with the PFP 
device and with the PFS. 
The randomisation was stratified by the 3 body weight groups (i.e. > 50 kg but ≤ 60 kg, > 60 kg but ≤ 
80 kg and > 80 kg). 
Blood samples were collected at 0 h, 3 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 144 h, 168 h (= 1 week), 
192 h, 264 h, 336 h (= day 15), 504 h (= day 22), 672 h (= day 29), 840 h (=day 36), 1008 h 
(~ 6 weeks; i.e. at the end of study). The sampling time for PK was also in this study too short to 
capture the terminal elimination phase. 
Primary PK endpoints were Cmax and AUC0-2wk for demonstration of PK comparability, because the 
applicant had an opinion that differences in the delivery devices were not anticipated to impact the 
terminal phase of the PK profiles. 
Other PK endpoints were Tmax, AUCt. In addition, if data permitted, AUCinf, CL/F, Vz/F and t½ were also 
estimated. 
Generally, in the device comparison studies, the primary PK parameters were the same as the ones 
used in the PK comparison studies of the products in healthy subjects i.e. AUCinf and Cmax in case of SC 
administration (often also AUClast); however, it can be accepted that the selected PK parameters were 
enough to find differences between the studied devices.  
PK results 
A total of 163 subjects (80 subjects in the PFS arm and 83 subjects in the PFP arm) were included in 
the PP population. Forty-eight (48) and 58 subjects in the PFS and PFP arm, respectively, had a well-
defined disposition terminal phase and therefore, estimation of AUCinf, CL/F, Vz/F and t1/2 was 
performed for those subjects. 
For the PK comparisons between the 2 device study arms, the 90% CIs for the test-to-reference ratios 
of primary (Cmax and AUC0-2wk) PK endpoints were within the pre-specified acceptance window of 
80.00% to 125.00% (Table 8).

The concentration profiles for adalimumab-Pfizer administered by PFP and PFS were quite similar; 
however, between 48 h and 192 h, the median concentrations of adalimumab-Pfizer administered by 
PFP were slightly higher (Figure 3).

The Tmax ranges also differed slightly between devices (for PFS Tmax range 48-674 h, median Tmax 166 h 
and for PFP 45-336 h, median Tmax 142 h). The sampling period of 6 weeks was too short to accurately 
characterise the elimination phase and consequently, for 32 and 25 subjects in the PFS and PFP, 
respectively, the elimination phase could not be estimated; however, the mean/median concentration 
profiles for PFP and PFS seem to be almost similar in the elimination phase and consequently, the PK

similarity between PFP and PFS following administration of a 40 mg SC adalimumab-Pfizer dose in 
healthy adult male and female subjects is considered demonstrated. 
The clinical phase III study in RA patients (B5381002) included also a sub-study, in which 50 patients 
in 19 study sites switched to receive adalimumab-Pfizer injections with PFP for 3 months (6 injections). 
The results of this sub-study were that PFP device was safe, quite easy to learn to use correctly and it 
was also preferred by patients. 
Clinical study B5381002 in patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an 
inadequate response to MTX  
This study was a multi-national, 2-arm, randomised (1:1), double-blind, parallel-group study designed 
to  evaluate  the  safety,  efficacy,  population  PK,  and  immunogenicity  of  adalimumab-Pfizer  versus 
Humira-EU administered SC in the abdomen or thigh by a PFS, both in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX) to treat subjects with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX 
therapy. 
The study is described in Chapter 2.6.1. Main study. The PK results are summarised below. 
The evaluation of PK of Amsparity to Humira-EU was a secondary objective in this clinical study. The 
serum drug concentrations were measured in treatment periods 1 and 2 (TP1 and TP2). In addition, 
population PK assessment was planned with the drug concentration-time data from TP1 (prior to the 
week 26 injection) using a nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach in accordance with regulatory 
guidance. The population PK analysis was reported separately, in a population modelling analysis 
report (PMAR). 
PK results 
The applicant stated that mean and median serum concentration data should be interpreted with 
caution due to sampling and dosing deviations, likely introducing additional inter-subject variability and 
it is true that there were a lot of deviations in relation to the PK sampling. The mean serum 
concentrations were slightly higher for the Amsparity group than Humira-EU group throughout the 
whole study (Table 9 and Table 10).

There existed considerable overlap in serum concentrations between the studied groups and the 
variation in the concentrations was high (CVs ranging from 48-75% in TP1 and 65-81% in TP2). The 
PK data (i.e. trough concentrations) received from this study support the same phenomenon, which 
was also seen in the PK studies i.e. with adalimumab-Pfizer the serum concentrations are slightly 
higher than with Humira-EU. The applicant was requested to perform direct comparison of the trough 
concentrations between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU, presenting point estimates and 90% CIs. 
This comparative analysis was asked to be provided for all visits where the PK measurements were 
done. In addition, the same was asked to be provided for ADA-positive and ADA-negative subgroups 
separately. The applicant performed the direct comparison of the trough concentrations between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU, as requested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 45/112 
 
 
 
 
 
In ADA-positive subjects, on days 15 and 43, the 90% CI included 1.00; however, the upper limits 
were over 1.25. On days 85 and 183, the 90% CI range was wide. The lower limits were < 0.80 and 
upper limits > 1.25. In addition, the CV% was high in both study groups at every studied time points. 
In ADA-negative subjects, the 90% CI was between the BE range i.e. 0.80-1.25 (including 1.00) and 
the CV% was much lower than in ADA-positive subjects. 
The 90% CIs for all subjects were as follows: on day 15, the lower limit was > 1.00 and the upper limit 
was 1.25. In all other time points, the lower limit was < 1.00 (the range including 1.00); however, the 
upper limit was > 1.25. The CV%s were quite high in both study groups. 
The trough concentrations were similar levels in ADA negative subjects between the studied 
treatments. The mean trough concentrations in ADA-positive subjects were much lower than in ADA-
negative subjects and the variability in the trough concentrations were very high in both treatments. 
The geometric mean ratios of trough concentrations were higher on days 15, 43 and 183 in 
adalimumab-Pfizer group and on day 85 in Humira-EU group. The slightly higher mean trough 
concentrations in ADA-positive and in ADA-negative subjects in the adalimumab-Pfizer group impact on 
the trough concentrations in all subjects. The mean trough concentrations were slightly higher in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the Humira-EU group; however, the variability in trough 
concentrations was high and it can be considered that the differences in trough concentrations are not 
clinically relevant. 
The mean steady-state trough concentrations (i.e. ~ 5-8 µg/ml) were at the same level as informed in 
the Humira SmPC in RA patients with MTX. 
Root cause investigations before the marketing authorisation application (MAA) submission 
Before submission of the MAA, extensive root cause examinations were done by the applicant to find 
reasons for slightly higher concentrations of adalimumab-Pfizer compared to the Humira-EU and 
Humira-US. The investigations included as follows: 
• 
sensitivity analyses with protein content adjusted PK parameters 
•  ADA/NAb result in relation to the PK 
• 
extensive evaluation of quality attributes related to the similarity and their potential impact on 
activity, PK/PD, safety and immunogenicity. 
Including the protein-content in the comparisons had only minimal impact on the PK parameter ratios 
and corresponding 90% CIs compared to the original comparisons. The percentage and 
minimum/maximum titres of ADAs and NAbs appeared rather similar across all treatment arms; 
however, some inconsistencies in immunogenicity patterns between studies are evident. Some 
differences in the early PK parameter ratios may represent, at least in part, the contribution from the 
difference in the percent of molecules with high mannose species. The Humira reference/comparator 
products have higher mannose glycoform levels, which may contribute to faster clearance than with 
the test product. 
Population PK analyses 
Two population PK analysis reports were presented in the dossier: One for data from studies B5381001 
and B5381007 (single dose in healthy subjects; dense PK sampling) and another for data from study 
B5381002 (multiple doses in RA patients; sparse PK sampling). 
The PPK model for healthy subjects was a two-compartment model with absorption lag-time, first order 
absorption and first order elimination. A body weight based allometric function with fixed values 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 46/112 
 
 
 
 
(0.75 for CL/F and Q/F, 1 for Vc/F and Vp/F) was applied to clearance and distribution parameters. 
Adalimumab-Pfizer was estimated to have an approximately 8% lower CL/F than Humira-EU (bootstrap 
95% CI 1.57% - 10.20%), which is in line with the observed higher AUC values of adalimumab-Pfizer 
in studies B5381001 and B5381007. The other identified covariates on CL/F, i.e. increased clearance in 
subjects with anti-drug antibodies (parameterised as time-varying ADA titer) and decreased clearance 
with increasing serum albumin level, are biologically plausible and previously reported in the literature. 
No major deficiencies in the model were identified and it is appropriate for describing the PK of 
adalimumab after a single SC injection in healthy subjects. However, the population PK analysis for 
healthy subjects was an exploratory analysis, which is not considered to be relevant in concluding 
whether adalimumab-Pfizer is biosimilar with Humira. 
For RA patients, independent PPK models were developed for each product (adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU). These models had several uncertainties and it cannot be concluded that the presented 
models adequately describe the pharmacokinetics of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU in patients 
with moderately to severely active RA. Clarifications in regard with the models are not requested, 
however, because PPK modelling is not considered to be relevant in concluding whether adalimumab-
Pfizer is biosimilar with Humira. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic (PD) data were evaluated in the Phase 1 bioequivalence studies in healthy 
volunteers since the validated PD markers do not exist for the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors. Regarding 
the primary PD a set of non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed. The studies on 
secondary PD have not been provided and neither been required according to the EMA guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
hs-CRP 
Hs-CRP (High sensitivity C-reactive protein) was among the biochemistry parameters investigated in 
the clinical efficacy and safety study in RA patients (B5381002). No clinically significant differences 
were revealed in the reached hs-CRP levels. See section 2.6. Clinical efficacy for the outcome of the 
hs-CRP analysis. 
Vectra-DA 
In addition, exploratory biomarker endpoints included Vectra-DA [MBDA disease activity] score and 
individual Vectra-DA components up to Week 26 (TP1) in ITT population in study B5381002. Vectra-DA 
score was measured at Week 0, 6, 12, and 26. Vectra-DA is composed of 12 biomarkers (VCAM-1, 
TNFR-I, IL-6, EGF, VEGF, YKL-40, MMP-1, MMP-3, resistin, leptin, SAA, and CRP). Multi-biomarker 
disease activity (MBDA) score was calculated using a proprietary validated algorithm to provide a 
score, on a scale of 1 to 100. 
Serum levels of total rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) were 
evaluated as additional biomarker assessments. 
Mean Vectra-DA score showed similar high baseline disease activity with a mean (SD) Vectra-DA of 
57.2 (14.44) for the adalimumab-Pfizer arm and 58.3 (15.34) for the Humira-EU arm, and 78.45% and 
81.67% of subjects were in the high Vectra-DA score category (>44) at baseline for the adalimumab-
Pfizer and Humira-EU arms, respectively. 
The Vectra-DA scores were similar between the 2 treatment arms at each study visit up to Week 26. 
Mean changes from baseline were similar between treatment arms in the ITT population. Mean (SD) 
Vectra-DA scores decreased by 11.9 (14.02) and 12.4 (13.82) at Week 6 in the adalimumab-Pfizer and

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of Amsparity was compared to Humira-EU in three clinical studies (studies B5381001, 
B5381007 and B5381002).  
Studies B5381001 and B5381007 in healthy subjects were PK studies, in which adalimumab was 
administered 40 mg SC as a single-dose. Study B5381002 was performed in RA patients and 
adalimumab was administered 40 mg SC every other week up to week 78. The administration device 
was the PFS in all these studies; except the clinical study B5381002 has an additional sub-group study 
with PFP. In addition, PK of adalimumab-Pfizer was evaluated in one clinical study (B5381005), in 
where the adalimumab was administered from the PFP or PFS in healthy subjects. 
The development programme to demonstrate the PK similarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira 
was in general adequate; however, all recommendations given by the CHMP were not followed (e.g. 
duration of PK sampling time in PK comparability studies). 
PK study B5381001 
The study B5381001 was performed in healthy subjects to establish comparability between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU and Humira-US in terms of Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt and AUCinf. The 
applicant was advised by the CHMP before the study conduction that the sampling time period should 
be extended to at least 10 weeks; however, the advice was not followed, and the sampling time period 
was only up to 6 weeks. Consequently, there existed a lot of subjects (almost 50%) whose AUCt did 
not cover at least 80% of AUCinf and consequently, the whole PK profiles including the late elimination 
phase can be considered not optimally characterised. 
The PK similarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU was demonstrated in Cmax and AUC0-2wk; 
however, in AUCt and AUCinf the PK similarity was not formally met. All exposure indicating mean PK 
parameters (i.e. AUCs and Cmax) were numerically higher in adalimumab-Pfizer treatment group than 
in Humira-EU and Humira-US. The test-to-reference ratios of adjusted means in all exposure indicating 
parameters were above 100% and the 90% CIs for the test-to-reference of AUCt and AUCinf excluded 
100%. In the exploratory analysis, in which the weight was used as covariate, the point estimates for 
AUCs and Cmax were above 100%; however, the 90% CIs for the primary PK parameters were within 
80.00-125.00% (including 100.00%) in comparison of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. In the 
comparison of AUCs between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-US and Humira-EU and Humira–US the 
90% CIs were all above 100% (the upper limit being even > 125.00%). 
The percentage of ADA was high (85,5% and 90% in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU; see results 
from Chapter 2.7. Clinical safety) and differences in the percentage of ADA and NAb, and ADA onset 
time between studied products was thought by the applicant to contribute to the failure of the AUCt to 
meet the PK similarity criteria. ADA formation against adalimumab is known to be accompanied by 
increased clearance (CL) and reduced exposure (and possible loss of efficacy) and in this study, the 
mean CL and AUCs were slightly lower with the reference/comparator products than with the test 
product. 
Pivotal PK study B5381007 
This additional single-dose PK study in healthy subject was conducted upon request from CHMP during 
scientific advice. The aim was to clarify if the differences in immunogenicity and PK measures in the 
first study B5381001 were real, or a play of chance. 
The study design of B5381007 was improved by increasing sample size (based on an observed inter-
individual variability of 43% for AUCinf in the study B5381001). The randomisation was stratified by 3 
weight categories and the heterogeneity was reduced by narrowing age and weight ranges. The 
Assessment report

sampling period for PK was expanded from 6 weeks to 7 weeks. The sampling period was still too short 
and there exist many subjects, whose AUCt did not cover at least 80% of AUCinf; however, the amount 
of these subjects (> 20%) was smaller than in the study B5281001. Also in this study, it can be noted 
that the characterisation of the whole PK profiles was not optimal. In the study B5381007, the 
biosimilarity in PK can be considered formally met between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU (and 
also between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-US; all 90% CIs for test-to-reference ratios of Cmax, AUC0-
2wk, AUCt and AUCinf were within the pre-specified acceptance range of 80.00% to 125.00%) and the 
results from this study can be considered to support the biosimilarity in PK. The point estimates in 
exposure indicating PK parameters, however, were all above 100% i.e. adalimumab-Pfizer 
concentrations were slightly higher than the concentrations of the reference/comparator products. The 
biggest differences between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU were in the Cmax and AUC0-2wk values, in 
which the 90% CIs for test-to-reference ratios did not include 100%, but were above 100%. The 
90%CIs for test-to-Humira-US ratios in primary PK parameters were all above 100%. 
In the study B5381007 the percentage of ADAs/NAbs in the adalimumab-Pfizer group was higher than 
in the Humira-EU group indicating that the applicant’s argument that adalimumab-Pfizer may be less 
immunogenic (on the basis of the ADA/NAb results in the study B5381001 and also in the study 
B5381002) may be questioned. However, it is accepted, that seemingly lower immunogenicity in the 
2 studies (in the failed PK study and the study in RA patients) possibly plays some role in the slightly 
higher exposures seen in the adalimumab-Pfizer group. 
There were discrepancies in the reported protein contents of the batches used in the studies B5381001 
and B5381007. Upon request, the applicant adequately clarified the reasons for the differences in the 
reported protein contents of the batches used in the studies B5381001 and B5381007 and the correct 
protein contests of the batches were presented. In addition, the appropriate certificates of analysis for 
protein concentrations (CoAs) and test reports were provided by the applicant. 
Two subjects in the study B5381001 and 4 subjects in the study B5381007 were excluded from the 
primary PK analysis, because the serum drug concentration in the pre-dose sample was >5% of the 
Cmax. The studies were parallel group studies in healthy subjects. Consequently, clarification was 
needed for the high adalimumab concentrations in pre-dose samples. The applicant tried to find the 
reason for the pre-dose adalimumab concentrations > 5% of the Cmax; however, no reason was 
identified. The number of subjects having high pre-dose adalimumab concentrations was small and the 
subjects were in different study groups, hence, it can be considered that the exclusion of these 
subjects from the primary PK analysis did not affect the results. 
Clinical study B5381002 in RA patients with MTX 
The mean serum concentrations (adalimumab trough concentrations) were slightly higher for the 
adalimumab-Pfizer group than Humira-EU group throughout the whole study. It can be agreed that 
there existed considerable overlap in serum concentrations between the studied groups and the 
variation in the concentrations was high (CVs ranging from 48-75% in TP1 and 65-81% in TP2). The 
steady-state mean trough concentrations were at the similar level (i.e. ~ 5-8 µg/ml) as reported in RA 
patients with MTX in the Humira SmPC. Consequently, although the mean adalimumab concentrations 
were slightly higher with adalimumab-Pfizer than with Humira-EU, the differences in concentrations 
would not be expected to have any clinically significant impact on efficacy and safety. Upon request, 
the applicant performed direct comparison of the trough concentrations between adalimumab-Pfizer 
and Humira-EU, presenting point estimates and 90%CIs. The results confirmed the earlier conclusion 
that the differences in trough concentrations are not clinically relevant.

EMA/2756/2020

Clinical device comparison study B5381005 
The equivalence in absorption phase between PFP and PFS in administration of 40 mg SC was 
demonstrated and also the 90%CIs for the ratios of the geometric means (PFP/PFS) for AUCinf and 
AUClast were within the limits of 80.00% to 125.00% (including 100.00). Consequently, the PK 
similarity between PFP and PFS following administration of a 40 mg SC adalimumab-Pfizer dose in 
healthy subjects can be considered demonstrated. 
Population PK analyses 
One population PK analysis for healthy subjects and another for RA patients was presented in the 
dossier. These exploratory analyses are not considered to be relevant in concluding whether 
adalimumab-Pfizer is biosimilar with Humira. 
Root cause investigations before the MAA submission 
Based on the root cause investigations (see Chapter 2.4.3. Pharmacokinetics) there are a number of 
factors that may have contributed to the variable results obtained for the terminal elimination PK 
parameters in PK studies B5381001 and B5381007. These factors most likely represent a combination 
of study design factors, including powering limitations for study B5381001, and small differences in 
immunogenicity across the 2 studies. The high mannose N-linked glycans and protein concentration of 
the clinical batches might have had an additive effect contributing to the slightly higher PK parameters 
and trough concentrations observed in the clinical studies. 
Other issues 
No clinical studies in special populations and no in vitro or in vivo drug-drug-interaction studies were 
conducted with adalimumab-Pfizer and this is acceptable. 
In the proposed adalimumab-Pfizer SmPC the PK text in the Section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” 
was taken straight from the Humira SmPC. If the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira are considered to be 
biosimilar it is acceptable to use Humira SmPC text. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The mean concentrations were slightly higher with adalimumab-Pfizer compared to the Humira-EU in 
all clinical studies. The sampling times for characterisation of the whole PK profiles of studied products 
in the clinical studies B5381001, B5381005 and B5381007 were too short. However, the biosimilarity 
of adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU are supported by the PK data from the studies B5381007 
(although the point estimates were above 100%) and B5381002 (although the means of trough 
concentrations were slightly higher for adalimumab-Pfizer compared to Humira-EU). The steady-state 
mean trough concentrations were in the same level (~ 5-8 µg/ml) in the study B5381002 as reported 
for RA patients with MTX in the Humira SmPC. The slightly higher concentrations with adalimumab-
Pfizer compared to the Humira-EU can be considered clinically non-relevant. 
Also, the PK data including the weight as covariate in clinical study B5381001 supports the 
biosimilarity of adalimumab-Pfizer. 
No specific PD biomarkers are available for TNF-α functional studies and the data provided has been 
based on non-clinical primary pharmacodynamic studies. This is approvable since the question here is 
about biosimilar development and not of a novel treatment entity. The applicant has attached hs-CRP 
data, which did not reveal clinically significant differences in the reached hs-CRP levels. The descriptive 
data from the Vectra-DA analysis, which was composed of 12 biomarkers showed similar high baseline 
disease activity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. The scores were similar between the 2

treatment arms at each study visit up to week 26. 
In conclusion, the available PK/PD data support biosimilarity between Amsparity and the reference 
product Humira-EU.  
2.6.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.1.  Main study (B5381002) 
The main study (B5381002) was a multi-national, 2-arm, randomised, double-blind, parallel group 
study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, population PK, and immunogenicity of PF-06410293 
versus adalimumab-EU in combination with methotrexate (MTX) to treat subjects with moderately to 
severely active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX therapy. This study was also designed to 
evaluate clinical response, safety and immunogenicity after study drug transition (randomised blind 
single transition) from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293 after 6 or 12 months of adalimumab-EU 
treatment. The study design is presented in Figure 6.

Treatments 
The study treatment was provided through 3 treatment periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment period 1 (TP1) began with the first dose of study drug at Week 0 (Day 1) and 
concluded with the completion of Week 26 pre-dose assessments. Subjects were blindly 
randomised into adalimumab-EU and PF-06410293 in a 1:1 ratio. 
Treatment period 2 (TP2) began with the study drug dosing for Week 26, and concluded with 
the completion of Week 52 pre-dose assessments. At the beginning of TP2, eligible subjects 
from the adalimumab-EU arm were blindly re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to remain on 
adalimumab-EU or transition to PF-06410293. Week 52 was the end of the blinded treatment 
periods in this study.   
Treatment period 3 (TP3) began with Week 52 study drug dosing, with last study drug dosing 
scheduled on Week 76 and the end of treatment (EOT) visit on Week 78. At the beginning of 
TP3, all the remaining subjects on adalimumab-EU were switched to PF-06410293 (open label). 
Follow-Up Period: 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to Week 92). 
Investigators remained blinded to treatment assignments during TP1 and TP2 until the final study 
database lock. 
Following the first abdominal injection at the site, the study subjects self-administered 40 mg SC 
Amsparity or Humira-EU in a prefilled syringe (PFS) on a regular day of the week every other week 
throughout the study treatment periods. The treatment was according to the reference product 
labelling. 
The subjects received the stable background regimen of oral or intramuscular methotrexate (10 to 
25 mg per week). Subjects were also required to receive a stable background dose of oral folate. 
Subjects could also have been treated with additional concomitant therapies including low dose oral 
corticosteroids, 1 non–steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or cyclooxygenase–2 (COX–2) 
inhibitor, and non–opioid and allowed opioid analgesics, if meeting the study inclusion criteria and not 
meeting any exclusion criteria.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of Study B5381002 was to compare the treatment efficacy (ACR20 at Week 12) 
between Amsparity and Humira-EU. The hypothesis tested was the equivalence between the 
treatments. 
The secondary objectives were: to evaluate the overall safety (including immunogenicity) and 
tolerability; to evaluate the multiple composite and individual parameters of clinical response; to 
evaluate the overall safety, tolerability and immunogenicity; to evaluate the population 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) response.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ACR20 (20% improvement by American College of Rheumatology 
definition of improvement criteria) at Week 12. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  ACR20 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26. 
•  ACR50 and ACR70 at Week 12 and other time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26). 
• 
Individual components of the ACR criteria (including HAQ DI) with change from baseline at 
Week 12 and other time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26). 
•  Mean change from baseline in disease activity measured by DAS28 4 (CRP) at Week 12 and 
other time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26). 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects with a no, moderate, or good response, defined according to the EULAR 
response criteria, at Week 12 and other time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26). 
Proportion of subjects with DAS remission (DAS ≤ 2.6) at Week 12 and other time points 
(Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26). 
Proportion of subjects with ACR/EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) remission at 
Week 12 and other time points (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 18 and 26). 
Sample size 
This study planned to enrol approximately 560 subjects. The sample size was determined to have 
approximately 85% power to demonstrate equivalence between the 2 treatment arms (PF-06410293 
and adalimumab-EU) at Week 12 if the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed 
difference in ACR20 response rates fell within the equivalence margin of (-14%, 14%) in ITT 
population. The power calculation assumed the expected Week 12 ACR20 response rates for PF-
06410293 and adalimumab-EU to both be 60.0%. Sample size was calculated using the method 
provided in Chow, et al (2008)1. 
The sample size was higher than planned, 596 subjects were enrolled.  
The equivalence margin was derived using a meta-analysis of historical published study data from 
4 studies (Keystone 20042, Weinblatt 20033, Kim 20174, Chen 20095). This margin was also derived to 
demonstrate ≥50% preservation of the historical Week 12 ACR20 response rate difference based on 
the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for Humira as compared with placebo, in RA subjects with 
inadequate response to MTX. The equivalence margin was endorsed by CHMP.

Randomisation 
On Day 1, prior to study drug dosing, subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment 
arms to receive Amsparity or Humira-EU. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region ([North 
America, and Western Europe]; Japan; [South Korea and Taiwan]; Latin America; Rest of the World). 
A second randomisation was performed prior to dosing at Week 26 for all subjects who were continuing 
into TP2; subjects with insufficient disease response were withdrawn from further study treatment at 
the end of TP1 and were not re-randomised. At the time of the second randomisation, all subjects 
received a new randomisation code. Only subjects initially randomised to the Humira-EU treatment 
arm were potentially impacted, as these subjects were blindly re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either 
remain on Humira-EU or to switch Amsparity starting with the Week 26 dose. All subjects were to 
receive open label treatment with Amsparity starting at Week 52. 
Blinding (masking) 
Amsparity or Humira-EU PFS were supplied packaged as blinded supplies in which the external 
packaging cartons for Amsparity and Humira-EU appeared identical and were identifiable with a unique 
study drug container number. The study drug was labelled such that the subject and study staffs were 
unable to determine from the dispensed syringe packaging which treatment was assigned to the 
subject. 
Subject unique identifiers were associated with their randomisation and re-randomisation schedules 
and treatment assignments, and were retained centrally throughout the study. The pharmacist or 
approved representative who dispensed the study drug remained blinded to the assigned study drug(s) 
in TP1 and TP2 of the study. The study subjects, investigators, site staff, pharmacist, and Sponsor’s 
personnel directly involved in the study conduct remained blinded to the individually weighted residuals 
(IWRS) treatment assignments in TP1 and TP2 throughout the study conduct. The only exception was 
when unblinding was required in the event of an emerging safety issue. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-treat population (ITT) was defined as all subjects who were randomised to study 
treatment. The ITT population was used as the primary analysis population. This population was used 
for subject accountability and all efficacy analyses. 
The per protocol (PP) population was defined as all subjects who were randomised and received the 
study treatment as planned up to Week 12, had a Week 12 evaluation, and had no major protocol 
deviations. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a 20% or greater improvement 
in ACR clinical response at Week 12. The proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response rate at 
Week 12 was analysed by calculating a point estimate with 95% CIs for the difference between the 
2 treatment arms. The 95% CI was calculated using two different methods: Farrington-Manning score 
statistic and an unconditional approach. Neither of the methods was considered primary. 
The primary analysis for ACR20 was performed with the missing data imputed using a non-responder 
imputation method. This method imputed missing ACR20 response at Week 12 as ‘non-response; it 
also set to ‘non-response’ those ACR20 responses observed at Week 12 for subjects who discontinued 
treatment prior to Week 12.

study 
The ITT population is defined as all subjects who were re-randomised to TP2. 
One Subject treated with adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and one treated with PF-06410293/PF-06410293 withdrew from 
treatment due to AEs and completed the follow-up per protocol, but were incorrectly recorded as “Discontinued from Study” due to 
AEs on the end of study page.   
a. One subject was re-randomised but never received any treatment in TP2. This subject’s final dose of study treatment was in TP1, 
and this subject should not have been re-randomised into TP2.

Recruitment 
First subject first visit in study B5381002 was on the 25th of June 2015. Last subject completing week 
26 visit was on the 31st of August 2016 and the last subject completing week 52 visit was on the 1st 
of March 2017. 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
Six protocol amendments were implemented globally or locally, out of which numbers 4-5 were 
implemented after the study start. These latest amendments 4 and 5 affected the patients screening, 
inclusion/ exclusion criteria, and concomitant treatment. 
The applicant clarifies the impact of protocol amendments 4 and 5 on proper study conduct. 
Protocol 4 amendments having an impact on subject enrolment included beta-D-glucan testing to 
exclude patients with an invasive fungal infection and anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) (anti-dsDNA) anti-dsDNA antibody testing in Japanese subjects to exclude lupus, lupus-like 
syndromes, hepatitis, or other conditions associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies (other 
than rheumatoid arthritis [RA]). The latter testing was scheduled in Screening, Week 26, Week 52 and 
Week 78. Only one subject developed anti-dsDNA antibodies at screening with reported lupus-like 
syndrome, which resolved on Study Day 443. Regarding the former the applicant claims the given 
eligibility criteria to have no impact on study conduct.  
Protocol amendment 5 contained the allowance of inclusion of subjects with past medical history of 
seizures, not present in recent 5 years, inclusion of subjects with Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) 
and Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and inclusion of subjects who were previously treated for latent 
TB after at least 4 weeks of treatment to be enrolled. According to the applicant these enrolment 
criteria did not have any impact on study conduct.  
Based on the Applicants response the baseline DAS28-CRP prior and after the protocol Amendment 5 
in 577 and 20 patients, respectively, did not deviate significantly on median and mean values. The 3 
Japanese patients who were excluded based on Amendment 5 were not assessed for the RA status. 
Their exclusion is not expected to affect the overall outcome of the trial. Based on these data the 
introduction of the Amendment 5 is not expected to interfere with the main study results. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 30 (10.1%) subjects in the Amsparity arm and 46 (15.3%) subjects in the Humira-EU arm 
were excluded from the PP population. The most frequent reasons for exclusion were not receiving 
complete investigational product up to Week 12 and failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Three subjects in Humira-EU group received incorrect study drug and 1 subject did not receive all 
6 injections before Week 12 evaluation. Also, few protocol violations before Week 12 in the use of 
prohibited concomitant biologic medication and required concomitant MTX as well as in the protocol for 
joint count measurement occurred.  
The applicant clarified that the three subjects in the Humira-EU treatment arm who received incorrect 
study drug and 1 subject in the Humira-EU treatment arm that did not receive all 6 injections before 
the Week 12 evaluation were excluded from the PP population. The sensitivity analysis in the PP 
population did not show different result to the ITT population these protocol violations are not 
considered to have an impact on the overall study outcome.

In general, no significant difference in numbers of protocol violations were seen between compared 
groups. 
GCP inspection 
A routine GCP inspection was performed at three investigator sites for study B5381002. Overall, twelve 
major findings and a number of minor findings were reported by the inspectors from all three sites. No 
critical findings were reported at any site. The inspection team considered that the trial was performed 
in compliance with ethical and GCP principles and the data from the inspected sites was considered by 
the inspectors to be of sufficient quality. The CHMP considered that the GCP findings reported did not 
impact on the study results and conclusions.

The baseline characteristics between compared treatment groups are highly similar at TP1 baseline as 
well as at TP2 baseline. The mean MTX dose 15.2 mg/week was the same between groups as well as 
the percentage of patients with prior corticosteroid use (appr. half of the patients).  
The baseline rheumatoid arthritis characteristics were similar in RA duration, positive RF status, joint 
status, DAS-28 score, patient and professional global assessment and pain assessment as well as prior 
MTX, DMARD, and biologics use. Also, concomitant drug treatment and rescue therapy use was 
infrequent and the groups did not deviate significantly regarding it.

The primary analysis for ACR20 at Week 12 was performed with non-response imputed for subjects 
who discontinued treatment earlier than Week 12, or had a missing Week 12 assessment (NRI 
method).  Treatment comparison for the ITT population using NRI is presented in Table 18. The 95% 
CI for the difference in ACR20 response rate point estimate of -2.98 at week 12 between the 
treatments [−10.38%, 4.44%] in ITT population was well within the pre-defined equivalence margin of 
±14%. The robustness of the result was supported by the analysis in the PP population applying non-
responder analysis. The 95% CI for the treatment difference was -4.14% [−11.79%, 3.61%] (Table 
18, Figure 7, Figure 8).

For subjects who discontinued treatment earlier (prior to Week 12) or had a missing Week 12 assessment for any reason, a non–
responder was assigned to their Week 12 ACR20 assessment. 
PP Subject had Week 12 ACR20 assessment on Day 71 (14 days before Day 85); however, the assessment fell outside of the 
Week 12 data analysis window (Day 72-Day 106) by 1 day, resulting in a missing Week 12 ACR response.  This subject was 
excluded from the PP analysis. 
No imputation was applied for the PP population 
a. Score statistic method was the main primary analysis method used. If it did not converge then the unconditional approach was 
to be used. 
This plot is based on exact score statistic method. 
Comparisons between treatments are computed as PF-06410293 versus adalimumab-EU.

PF-06410293 and Adalimumab-EU, Using Non-Responder Imputation for Missing Data – TP1 
(90% CI and Asymmetric Margin) 
The sensitivity analysis of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 (with observed data) adjusting for region 
was  also  within  equivalence  margin  containing  also  value  0  (no  difference)  in  both  ITT  and  PP 
population.  The  analyses  assuming  all  the  missing  observations  in  adalimumab-Pfizer  arm  as  non-
responders  and  all  the  missing  observations  in  adalimumab-EU  arm  as  responders  and  vice  versa 
showed the 95% CI within acceptance margin, which included also value 0. 
Secondary outcomes 
A mixed-effect repeated measures model was used to estimate the difference in DAS28-4 (CRP) at 
visits up to Week 26. The differences between the treatment arms at each visit were all less than the 
minimal clinically important difference of 0.6 for DAS28-4 (CRP) in both ITT and PP populations. Mean 
changes from baseline in DAS28-4 (CRP) in the ITT population are presented in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Mean change from baseline in DAS28-4 (CRP) by visit, ITT population – TP1 
In  addition,  a  tipping  point  analysis  was  conducted  which  showed  the  mean  change  from  baseline 
across  all  visits  in  TP1  is  within  the  range  of  (-1.1,  -2.8)  suggesting  that  the  missing  data  do  not 
substantially  impact  the  conclusion  for  the  DAS28-4  (CRP)  change  from  baseline  at  Week  12 
treatment comparison. 
A  total  of  54.5%  and  49.0%  subjects  had  a  good  EULAR  response  in  the  adalimumab-Pfizer  and 
Humira-EU arms, respectively, at Week 26. 
The  difference  in  ACR20  response  rate  between  the  treatment  arms  ranged  from  -4.17%  to  2.26% 
across  all  study  visits  in  the  ITT  population  and  ranged  from  -3.64%  to  2.82%  in  the  PP  population, 
the  95%  CI  being,  although  not  pre-specified,  contained  within  equivalence  margin  set  for  Week  12 
[-14%, 14%] (Figure 10).

Similarly  ACR50  and  ACR70  response  rates  were  very  similar  between  compared  groups  with  the 
treatment  differences  in  response  rates  ranging  from  -1.88%  to  4.93%  and  2.50%  to  0.79%, 
respectively, across all study visits in the ITT population up to Week 26. 
Mean baseline PAAP score was 63.7 for the adalimumab-Pfizer arm and 65.9 for the Humira-EU arm. 
The  mean  score  decreased  over  time  by  35.1  in  the  adalimumab-Pfizer  arm,  and  by  33.5  in  the 
Humira-EU arm at Week 26 as compared to the baseline values. Mean baseline PGA score was 64.4 
for the adalimumab-Pfizer arm and 68.1 for the Humira-EU arm. The mean score decreased over time 
by 36.2 in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm, and by 36.3 in the Humira-EU arm at Week 26 as compared to 
the baseline values. 
Mean baseline hs-CRP concentration  was 21.3 mg/L for the adalimumab-Pfizer arm and 22.8 mg/L 
for  the  Humira-EU  arm.  Mean  (SD)  hs-CRP  level decreased  by  9.5  (22.81)  mg/L  and 12.2 (25.59)  in 
the  adalimumab-Pfizer  and  Humira-EU  arm,  respectively,  at  Week  12,  while  the  respective  decrease 
was 11.1 (21.92) and 13.6 (26.47) mg/L at Week 26 as compared to the baseline values Figure 11.

Subgroup Analysis (TP1) 
The subgroups were analysed in their ACR20 response rate at Week 12 and 2-sided 95% CI was 
calculated. Small number of subjects in each subgroup does not allow reliable comparison, but no clear 
evidence of marked differences at study Week 12 was seen. 
Geographic region 
The main differences were seen in the Latin American (including Mexico) subgroup in which high rates 
of Week 12 ACR20 response overall were seen (see Figure 12). 
ADA and NAb development 
In both arms, ACR20 response rate at Week 12 trended higher in the ADA negative and in the 
neutralising antibody (NAb) non-positive subjects, as compared to the ADA positive and NAb positive 
subjects, respectively. Week 12 ACR20 response rates were 63.7% and 65.7% for the adalimumab-
Pfizer and Humira-EU ADA-positive subgroups, respectively, and 70.9% and 77.2% for the 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU ADA-negative subgroups, respectively. Week 12 ACR20 response 
rates were 50.0% and 64.0% for the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU NAb-positive subgroups, 
respectively, and 70.9% and 74.0% for the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU NAb-non-positive 
subgroups, respectively. 
ACR20 week 26 results also trended higher in the ADA-negative and particularly in the NAb-non-
positive subjects. The response rates were similar between the 2 treatment arms for each ADA and 
NAb status group. The ACR20 response rates at Week 26 were 81.82% and 77.48% for the 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU ADA-positive subgroups, respectively, and 84.85% and 79.59% for 
the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU ADA-negative subgroups, respectively. Week 26 ACR20 
response rates were 65.8% and 66.7% for the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU NAb-positive 
subgroups, respectively, and 86.3% and 80.5% for the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU NAb-non-
positive subgroups, respectively. The CIs for the Week 26 ACR20 risk differences (test minus

reference) in each of the ADA positive/negative subgroups all included 0 with the exception of the NAb 
non-positive subgroup with 90% CI.

(95% CI; Symmetric Margin) 
Treatment period 2 (TP2) 
Mean DAS28-4 (CRP) value at Week 26 pre-dose was 3.2, 3.4, and 3.0 in the Amsparity/Amsparity, 
Humira-EU/Humira-EU, and Humira-EU/Amsparity groups, respectively, and decreased over TP2 in all 
study groups to 3.0, 3.2 and 2.8 at Week 52, respectively. The decreases from Week 26 pre-dose to 
Week 52 were comparable among the 3 treatment groups, and the differences between the treatment 
groups at each visit were all less than the minimal clinically important difference of 0.6 for DAS28-4 
(CRP). 
At Week 26 pre-dose, 56.9%, 49.6% and 59.7% of subjects had reached good EULAR response in 
the Amsparity/Amsparity, Humira-EU/Humira-EU, and Humira-EU/Amsparity groups, respectively; the 
response rates were 59.7%, 45.2% and 63.4% at Week 52, respectively. 
The ACR20 response rates at Week 26 pre-dose for the re-randomised TP2 subjects (ITT population), 
prior to the first injection of study drug in TP2, were 86.6%, 84.4% and 86.6% for the 
Amsparity/Amsparity, Humira-EU/Humira-EU, and Humira-EU/Amsparity groups, respectively. The 
corresponding ACR20 response rates at Week 52 were 82.7%, 79.3% and 84.3%. The ACR20 response 
rate was maintained in all 3 treatment groups during TP2. 
Overall, also the ACR50 and ACR70 response rates were comparable among the 3 treatment groups 
over TP2.

No clinically meaningful differences were observed in the other secondary endpoints although the 
Amsparity/Amsparity group had marginally worse outcome compared to Humira-EU/Humira-EU group 
at TP2.

2.6.2.  Supportive study – Study B5381002b 
This study was an open-label, multi-national, single arm, pre-filled pen (PFP) sub-study in a subset of 
subjects (n=50) from the main study with rheumatoid arthritis on concomitant methotrexate 
participating in protocol B5381002. 
The primary endpoint was a delivery system success rate (DSSR) based on participant (actual PFP 
User) and investigator/designated observer observations of the success of adalimumab-Pfizer 
administration by PFP. 
Substudy subjects received 6 consecutive bi-weekly adalimumab-Pfizer doses over a period of 
10 weeks using the PFP device (Figure 13). The 1st, 3rd, and 6th doses were injected under the 
supervision of the investigator or a designated observer. The rest of the injections were administered 
at home by subjects or their caregiver.

Methods 
Study participants 
The substudy (B5381002b) was conducted in 19 centres in 4 countries. 
The participants were between 18 to 65 years old (mean (54.9 years old) representing both genders 
(26% males and 74% females). 
Participant flow 
Only one subject out of 50 withdrew from the substudy and two subjects chose to continue with PFS 
device once they had completed the substudy with the PFP. 
Baseline data 
At baseline (week 52) the mean swollen joint count and number of tender joints was 1.9 (SD=4.7) and 
5.4 (SD=8.7), respectively. The mean DAS28-CRP was 2.87 (SD=1.14) at baseline. The mean length 
of prior RA history was 8 years (SD=10.4 years) and six subjects had additional medical history in 
upper arm (2 subjects had carpal tunnel syndrome, 1 finger joint contracture, 3 hand or wrist tendon 
rupture, 1 hand or wrist tendon rupture). None of the subjects had prior experience on the use of auto 
injector or injection pen. 
Numbers analysed 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population was defined as all subjects who are randomised to study 
treatment. The ITT population was used as the primary analysis population. 
The safety population was defined as all substudy subjects who received at least a portion of 1 dose of 
adalimumab-Pfizer using the PFP device. 
If the subject engaged in multiple PFP injection attempts at a visit, only the first attempt (i.e, the first 
PFP) was to be included in the calculation of the DSSR at the visit. 
Results 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
The DSSR at each visit was 100.0% with the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI exceeding 92% and 
the upper bound being 100.0%. 
The Observer Assessment Tool (OAT) observers recorded all injections as successful. Specific non-
physical help was reported by the observer for 3 (6.0%) subjects at Week 56 and 1 (2.3%) subject at 
Week 60. 
A total of 3 PFP users entered open text information in the Patient Assessment Tool (PAT) Question 7 
‘Other’ field, of whom 2 subjects received verbal help with 1 or more of the instruction steps during the 
substudy. One (1) subject answered ‘NA (not applicable)’ for the PAT Question 7 ‘Yes – I could not get 
the cap off’. 
Secondary outcomes 
Characterization of unsuccessful PFP injections 
The  DSSR  at  each  visit  and  overall  DSSR  were  100.0%.  A  high  proportion  of  completed  substudy 
subjects  (95.9%)  selected  to  continue  PFP  injections  for  the  remainder  of  the  B5381002  study 
treatment.  The  2  substudy  subjects  who  selected  the  PFS  device  injections  for  the  remainder  of  the

main  B5381002  study  were  one  with  PAT  comments  including  difficulty  ‘hearing  the  first  click’  and 
difficulty ‘making sure it’s in’ and other who had no PAT comment. 
A determination, by inspection, of the correct mechanical function of returned PFP devices 
The inspection of 292 used PFPs confirmed successful injection of the full drug volume for all returned 
used PFPs. There were no medical device complaints presented. CT scans documented a bent needle 
after use in 5 (1.7%) of the returned used PFPs. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal phase 3 study B5381002 
The design and conduct of the clinical equivalence study are generally considered as adequate. The 
study design was in accordance with the principles and expectations outlined in the EMA guidelines, 
following an equivalence design with symmetric inferiority and superiority margins. The overall design 
was also agreed by the CHMP in Scientific Advice. The primary efficacy endpoint was ACR20 response 
rate at week 12. The pre-defined equivalence margin ±14% is based on meta-analysis of four 
representative studies and preserves ≥50% of the treatment effect based on the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI for week 12 ACR20 response rate.  
The version of adalimumab-Pfizer used in the clinical studies was identical to the to-be-marketed 
product. The dose regimen was according to the posology and labelling of the reference product in RA 
and the one-year duration of treatment was adequate to evaluate the comparability in the preservation 
of the treatment effect, safety and long-term immunogenicity. The switching of the treatment from the 
reference product to adalimumab-Pfizer and the demonstration of interchangeability was not a 
requirement for biosimilars within EU (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1), but it supported the 
global development programme. This is acceptable since the adequate number of patients were 
included for one-year comparison between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups. 
The patients included in the trial were diagnosed with RA for at least 4-month fulfilling Class I, II or III 
of the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for Global Functional Status in RA, with moderately to severely active 
disease and who were on MTX for at least 12 weeks and been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks 
prior to first dose of study drug and on a stable dose of oral folic acid or oral folinic acid 
supplementation for at least 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug. The patient population 
chosen was an adequate sensitive population to detect differences between adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU.  
Based on the demographic features and baseline characteristics of the study subjects the compared 
groups were balanced including the RA disease status [e.g prior duration of RA, the number of swollen 
and tender joints, DAS28-4 (CRP) level], prior treatments as well as the previous medical history in 
general. There were no notable differences at baseline after re-randomisation. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were appropriate.  
Several protocol amendments (6) were implemented and some of them after the first subject visit. The 
proportion of protocol violations was very similar between the treatment arms, but more protocol 
deviations leading to exclusion of subjects from PP population were reported for adalimumab-EU arm 
compared to adalimumab-Pfizer arm. The protocol amendments and exclusion of subjects did not have 
a significant impact on the study outcome. The patients excluded from the PP population and the 
sensitivity analysis in this population supported the result obtained in the ITT population and 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 78/112 
 
 
 
 
biosimilarity in efficacy. The number of informed dropouts was relatively low and balanced in all 
treatment arms. There were more discontinuations in Humira-EU group as compared to the 
adalimumab-Pfizer during TP 1. During TP 2, there were more discontinuations in adalimumab-
Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer group as compared to other two treatment arms. However, it is considered 
that the frequency of discontinuation is too low to cause interference to the study outcome. The 
applicant has provided the region/country/centre specific data on dropouts and although the data in 
Latin American region seem exceeding the normal response rate expected in adalimumab-Pfizer its 
impact on the overall study outcome is limited. 
The objectives of the study were appropriately set. The chosen primary endpoint and equivalence 
margin are acceptable, justified and sensitive while the primary endpoint time point was selected from 
the still ascending part of the time-response curve although the steepest phase had already been 
passed at week 12. The chosen secondary endpoints comprising also continuous endpoint DAS28-4 
(CRP) and ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 measured in eleven time points up to one year are appropriate. 
The study was adequately powered (87%) and the sample size measurements were appropriate for 
equivalence design with symmetric inferiority and superiority margins for EU of [-14%, 14%] with a 
total sample size of 596 subjects in a 1:1 ratio. The selected study populations and their definitions 
with sensitivity analysis performed in PP population were acceptable although both ITT and PP 
populations should have been kept equally important in primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses for 
ACR20 and DAS28-4 (CRP) at week 12 were performed using various imputation methods for missing 
data to explore the potential impact of assumptions regarding missing data, which is agreed. The 
randomisation procedure and stratification conditions of study sample were set appropriately. 
The B5381002b substudy 
The study design and the endpoints are acceptable as well as the duration of the study and the 
posology, which is according to the labelling. In addition, the sample size of 50 subjects is adequate. 
The baseline demographic characteristics are appropriate with a wide age range (also elderly) and both 
genders presented. The applicant has explained how the subjects were selected to the screening from 
the TP2 population and the criteria how the eventual study population was enrolled (50 subjects 
entered the substudy of 63 subjects screened). The compliance of the study was high with only one 
subject discontinuing the study. 
Human factor (HF) validation studies were performed in parallel to the preparation for and conduct of 
the B5381002b substudy. Multiple iterations of the IFU were tested on both trained and untrained 
participants with a variety of previous experience of using autoinjectors in seven (7) formative studies 
and one (1) summative human factors test (data not shown). It was determined from the formative 
studies that prior training of users was not required in order to ensure safe and effective use of the 
PFP. The Summative HF study was, therefore, conducted with untrained participants only. 
In the B5381002 substudy training was provided for the study subjects or their caregivers on proper 
use of the device with the available product instructional material, and the first injection was 
administered at the clinic under the supervision of the investigator. The investigator or designated 
observer determined whether the subject or their caregiver was able to correctly administer the 
injection with PFP.  
In principle the population indicated would represent the population possessing problems in self-
administration. Thus, a statement has been added to the PFP and PFS product labelling stating “After 
proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Amsparity if their physician 
determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary”. The healthcare provider 
can determine if the patients are suitable for using an injector device and provide suitable training 
using the instructions for use provided with the product before first use of the product. Based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 79/112 
 
 
 
 
validation data the PFP presentation is easy to hold and safe to use, but the subjects with more severe 
hand disability need further evaluation by the physician on their ability to use the injector device. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal Phase 3 study B5381002 
The primary endpoint, ACR20 response rate at week 12, in ITT population was 68.4% (203/297) and 
71.3% (214/300) in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU treatment groups, respectively, the point 
estimate for the difference being -2.98% (-10.38%, 4.44%). The 95% CI for the difference in 
response rate was well within the pre-determined equivalence margin of ±14% including also zero. 
The corresponding figures in PP population were 71.1% (189/266) and 75.2% (191/254), the point 
estimate for the difference in efficacy being –4.14% (-11.79%, 3.61%). Thus, the equivalence was 
contained within the equivalence margin also in PP population and the response rates consistent using 
both the observed data and non-responder imputation. Similarly, the equivalence was reached also in 
geographic area covariate-adjusted analysis. 
The secondary endpoint, mean DAS28-4 (CRP) value at week 12, in ITT population was -2.2 (n=290; 
SD=1.20) and -2.3 (293; 1.26) in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups, respectively, the 
difference between treatments being less than the minimally clinically important difference of 0.6. This 
was demonstrated also with tipping point analysis of the missing values. Similarly, in the other time 
points measured up to week 26 the difference between treatments was minimal and not clinically 
important indicating low disease activity. The curves of the mean change from baseline in DAS28-CRP 
over time were superimposable in ITT population, with slightly higher improvement in Humira-EU 
group. The results in the other secondary variables ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates by visits 
supported also the similarity with highly similar time-response curves throughout the period up to 
week 26. Slightly higher response rate was seen in adalimumab-Pfizer group at the later time points 
up to week 26, but the opposite was seen in the number of tender and swollen joints. The difference 
and treatment effect in ACR and DAS28-4 (CRP) remained the same during the TP2 up to week 52 
without any signs of the withering effect. The difference between treatments was seen in the mean 
change from baseline in hs-CRP by visit in ITT population, the change being larger in Humira-EU group 
after week 1 visit. However, also the baseline level was higher in Humira-EU group explaining larger 
decrease in this group. The absolute CRP level reached did not differ meaningfully between the 
treatments. Similarity was seen also in global patient and professional assessment and EULAR/ACR 
components. Altogether, the secondary outcomes were in line with the primary outcome supporting 
the biosimilarity claim. 
The subgroup analysis by ADA status showed similar ACR20 response in ADA-positive subjects 
between treatment groups at week 12 (63.7% vs. 65.7% in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups, 
respectively), the response rate overall being slightly lower comparing to the ADA-negative subjects. 
The respective response rate in ADA-negative patients was 70.9% and 77.2%. Instead, the difference 
in ACR20 response at week 12 was significantly higher in Humira-EU group (64.0%) compared to 
adalimumab-Pfizer group (50.0%) in NAb-positive subjects. Based on descriptive data the point 
estimate for ACR20 difference in ADA-positive patients was -1.98 (95% CI -15.4; 11.4) and in the 
more sensitive antibody negative patients -6.33 (95% CI -14.9; 2.25). In NAb-positive patients the 
difference was -14% (95% CI -39.6; 11.6) and in NAb-negative patients -3.05 (95% CI -10.6; 4.5). 
Although, this difference in efficacy in NAb-positive patients might be related to the low number of 
patients in this NAb-positive subgroup leading to the low precision and wide CI, the applicant was 
requested to demonstrate the temporal impact of the ADA- and NAb positivity in efficacy and whether 
withering effect is present in ADA- or NAb-positive patients in clinical efficacy. At week 12, the number 
of subjects with Nab was higher (n= 32) in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the Humira-EU group 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 80/112 
 
 
 
 
(n=25). At week 26, however, the number of NAb positive subjects was similar (41 vs. 42 in 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira–EU, respectively). The difference in ACR20 response rate had 
decreased from the 14% at week 12 and was small (-0.813%), though still in favour of Humira-EU, at 
Week 26. The differences between groups were statistically non-significant at both time points. 
Analyses performed with the more sensitive DAS28-4(CRP) endpoint showed a significant overlap in 
the mean (+/- SD) for both NAb and ADA status with no withering effect or trending down overtime in 
Nab positive subjects. A small and statistically non-significant difference was seen in the change of 
DAS28-1 (CRP) value from baseline to week 12 (appr. -1.6 vs. -2; difference -0.4) increasing slightly 
at week 26 (appr. -1.8 vs. -2.6; difference -0.8). The DAS28-4 (CRP) values were closely similar 
overtime in ADA positive subgroups of the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU arms of the study. 
Hence, the observed slight differences in treatment response between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-
EU groups are considered clinically non-relevant regardless of Nab and ADA status. The small 
differences are deemed not to exclude biosimilarity. 
Since geographic area variation in ACR20 response between treatments was seen the possible centre 
effect was inspected by the applicant by comparing the data from the centres with at least 10 study 
subjects (ranging from 10 to 19 by centre). Based on the data, heterogeneous results were obtained, 
the treatment response difference ranging from the positive difference of 42.9% on benefit of 
biosimilar candidate to negative difference of 33.33%. Although the numbers of subjects per compared 
treatment group per centre were not provided the data did not imply some of the centres to drive the 
efficacy outcome and bias the study.  
Extrapolation from RA to other indications where neutralising the soluble TNF-ɑ is the primary 
mechanism involved, e.g. psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, is acceptable. The applicant has 
provided supportive documentation and justification for the extrapolation to all indications registered 
for the originator with the discussion on the impact of slightly higher exposure on safety in various 
indications. Based on the provided supportive data the extrapolation to all Humira-EU indications is 
acceptable from the clinical point of view. 
The B5381002b substudy 
The data showed good usability of the PFP device in the selected population in self injection with the 
delivery system success rate being 100% in all study participants and good functionality of the device. 
However, the data from patients with extreme manual disability is missing. The training and evaluation 
of patients for self-injection is required and is included in the instructions in the labelling of the 
product.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The main efficacy and safety study B5381002 showed therapeutic equivalence between Amsparity and 
Humira-EU in the sensitive RA study population supporting the similarity claim in efficacy. These 
findings are supported by the secondary endpoints results in TP1 and TP2 that were similar for 
Amsparity and Humira-EU as well as the data on the sustained treatment effect seen in TP3. 
Extrapolation to all Humira-EU indications is also acceptable from the clinical point of view. 
Furthermore, the data showed good usability of the PFP device in the selected population with self-
injection. Based on the clinical data the claim for the biosimilarity between Amsparity and Humira-EU is 
supported.

2.7.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of Amsparity was investigated in 4 clinical studies: 2 single subcutaneous (SC) dose 
PK studies in healthy volunteers, 1 single SC dose study using a pre-filled syringe (PFS) and a pre-
filled pen (PFP) in healthy volunteers, and 1 multi-dose safety and efficacy study in subjects with 
moderately to severely active RA which included an optional device substudy using a PFP.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 1,329 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication, 950 of them Amsparity. The 
number of subjects in each treatment group is also provided in Table 2. 
Healthy volunteers 
In study B5381001, a total of 210 subjects were randomised and treated in 1 of the of 3 study 
treatment groups: 69 subjects received Amsparity, 71 subjects received Humira-US, and 70 subjects 
received Humira-EU. 
In study B5381007, a total of 359 subjects were randomised and treated in 1 of 3 study treatment 
groups: 121 subjects received Amsparity, 119 subjects received Humira-US, and 119 subjects received 
Humira-EU. 
In study B5381005, a total of 164 subjects were randomised and treated in 1 of 2 study treatment 
arms: 81 subjects received Amsparity treatment dosed with the PFS device, and 83 subjects received 
Amsparity treatment dosed with the PFP device. 
The safety follow-up in the PK studies ranged from 6 to 10 weeks.  
Rheumatoid arthritis patients (Study B5381002) 
Treatment Period 1 (week 26) 
A total of 597 subjects were randomised and 596 subjects received treatment in the safety population 
of TP1: 297 subjects in the Amsparity arm, and 299 subjects in the Humira-EU arm. The median 
duration of both Amsparity and Humira-EU treatments in TP1 was 24.1 weeks for each of the 
treatment arms. The subjects received Amsparity or Humira-EU during TP1, injected SC by PFS in 
either the thigh or the abdomen. 
Treatment Period 2 (week 52) 
Prior to Week 26 dosing, 552 subjects were blindly re-randomised at entry into TP2: 283 and 135 
subjects originally assigned to Amsparity and Humira-EU in TP1 remained on their original study drug, 
respectively, and 134 subjects originally assigned to Humira-EU blindly switched to Amsparity. One 
subject in the Humira-EU/Amsparity group was re-randomised but not treated in TP2; therefore, the 
safety population included 283 subjects in the Amsparity/Amsparity, 135 subjects in the Humira-
EU/Humira-EU, and 133 subjects in the Humira-EU/Amsparity treatment groups. 
Treatment Period 3 (week 52 – week 78; and follow-up study week 79 – week 92) 
The  median  duration  of  treatment  was  24.1  weeks  during  TP3  for  all  3  treatment  groups.  Drug 
exposure was generally balanced across the 3 treatment groups, the median total dose of study drug 
received in TP3 being 520.0 mg in all 3 treatment groups. 
Safety Analysis of One-Year Safety Data  
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 82/112 
 
 
 
 
The overall safety data over a 52-week period were summarised for subjects who received either 
Amsparity only (351 days median duration) or Humira-EU only (170 days median duration) for the 
one-year (TP1 Safety Population) of Study B5381002. The patient year of exposure was 287.5 and 
216.1 for Amsparity only and Humira-EU only. 
B5381002 Sub-study 
Subcutaneous injections (N=294) were administered by the subject or their non-healthcare 
professional caregiver using the Amsparity PFP device for up to 12 weeks. Altogether, 49 subjects 
completed the sub-study (6 PFP injections). These PFP users successfully administered the full volume 
of Amsparity in 100% of the injection attempts. Of these subjects 47 were elected to continue PFP 
injections for the remainder of TP3. 
In conclusion, the follow-up time of the comparative safety and efficacy study is considered long 
enough for a biosimilar development programme, and the dosing of Amsparity / Humira-EU 
corresponds with the recommended dosing of Humira in clinical practise. 
Adverse events 
All subjects randomised and treated with at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the safety 
analysis. No integrated analyses of adverse events (AEs) across the 4 studies were planned or 
performed due to the different study designs, including different treated populations and duration of 
treatments.

Subjects with AEs were fewer in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than that in the Humira-EU group: 32 
(46.4%) vs. 44 (62.9%) in PK study B5381001. One SAE occurred in the study, in the Humira-EU 
group (discussed more in detail in the next section). Treatment–related TEAEs were half as common in 
the adalimumab-Pfizer group (49) than in the Humira-EU group (93). Of the most common AEs (SOCs 
≥5% presented) oral herpes (PT) was the only AE that appeared more often in the adalimumab-Pfizer 
group than in the either of the Humira groups. The incidence in this case was, however, low with 4 
subjects in the adalimumab-Pfizer group and 2 subjects in the Humira EU-group, thus no concern is 
raised about this. 
In the PK study B5381007, 69 subjects (57.0%) experienced a TEAE in the adalimumab-Pfizer group, 
which is more than compared to Humira-EU group: 48 subjects (40.3%). No SAEs were reported. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 90 subjects, including 55 TEAEs in the adalimumab-Pfizer 
group which is more often than the 35 TEAEs reported in the Humira-EU group. Respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders were the most common AEs in this PK study and cough was notably more 
commonly seen in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the Humira-EU group: 11 (9.1%) vs. 2 (1.7%). 
The coughs were, however, reported not to be severe in nature, and this slight numerical difference 
was not seen in the RA-study, hence the difference is considered a chance finding. The second most 
common AE was headache, but these were more equally present across the study groups. AEs related 
to laboratory parameters are discussed in a separate section.

Proportion of subjects with AEs and receiving adalimumab-Pfizer was smaller in study B5381005 
(36.6%) than it was in study B5381001 (46.4%) or in study B5381007 (57.0%). One SAE was seen in 
this study (see next section). The most common AE in this study was headache, which occurred in 
12.8% of the subjects.

All-causality TEAEs with the highest rates per 100 patient-years are shown in Table 33. The AE 
incidences were similar in study B5381002 TP1 and TP2 in study patients receiving adalimumab-Pfizer 
and Humira-EU. The five most common AE types (PTs) in TP1 were: Viral upper respiratory tract 
infection, Headache, Anaemia, ALT increased, and Hypertension. Anaemia was more often seen in 
adalimumab-Pfizer than in Humira-EU group: 3.0% vs. 0.7%. In TP2, the most common AE types 
were: Viral upper respiratory tract infection, Upper respiratory tract infection, Hypertension, ALT 
increased, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, Neutropenia, Headache, and Urinary tract 
infection. Of these, headache was more often (3.2% vs 0.7%), and viral upper respiratory tract 
infection and hypertension slightly more often seen in the adalimumab-Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer arm 
than in the Humira-EU/Humira-EU arm. Only one of the headache cases was severe (Grade 3), but 
considered unrelated to study drug, adalimumab-Pfizer. No concerns were raised about this event 
type, though headache was more common also in any adalimumab-Pfizer than in the Humira-EU-
treated study patients in the one-year follow-up. In general, subjects with AEs were fewer in 
adalimumab-Pfizer arms than in Humira-EU arms (64% vs. 75%) in this one-year safety analysis. 
There were 8 (2.7%) AEs of Grade 3 or higher related to the treatment in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm 
and 9 (3.0%) in Humira-EU arm in TP1. In TP2, these numbers were: 3 (1.1%) subjects in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer group and 2 (1.5%) subjects in the Humira-EU/Humira-EU 
group (no subjects in the Humira-EU/adalimumab-Pfizer group). In TP3 and the follow-up period, 28 
(5.5%) subjects reported Grade 3 or higher all-causality TEAEs (Table 31). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the PK studies, one serious adverse event (SAE) was reported requiring hospitalisation in the 
Humira-EU arm (study B5381001) and one SAE was requiring hospitalisation in the adalimumab-Pfizer 
arm (study B5381005). No SAEs were reported in study B5381007. 
In the clinical study in RA patients, SAEs occurred as often in both treatment arms during TP1 (rate 
being 4.0% for adalimumab-Pfizer vs. 4.3% for Humira-EU). There were no major differences in rates 
in treatment relation either: 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively. Two suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) were reported for adalimumab-Pfizer during TP1 in two subjects. Subsequently, 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 90/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these were downgraded, and they were no longer meeting SUSAR criteria. In TP2, the study patients in 
the adalimumab-Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer arm experienced SAEs less often than the study patients in 
the Humira-EU/Humira-EU arm: 1.4% vs. 4.4%. SAEs were less often treatment-related too: 0.7% vs. 
1.5%, respectively. No subjects, who had changed from adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU experienced 
SAEs. Two SUSARs were reported during TP2 in two subjects, one in the adalimumab-
Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer arm and one in the Humira-EU/Humira-EU arm. Both events were reported 
as resolved. 
In TP1, related to laboratory there were 2 SAEs in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm (1 pancytopenia, 1 
anemia) and 1 SAE in the Humira-EU (hypokalemia). The grades of these SAEs were as follows: 
pancytopenia Grade 3, anemia Grade 4, and hypokalemia Grade 3. There were no SAEs related to 
laboratory findings in TP2. 
No significant differences between-group were seen in SAEs in TP3 and Follow-up (Table 31).  
Death 
In total, two deaths were reported in the adalimumab-Pfizer clinical development programme. These 
occurred during the comparative safety and efficacy study B5381002. The first case occurred in the 
Humira-EU arm during TP1, and according to the investigator, the case was related to underlying 
medical history. The other death was due to SAEs of anaemia, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
shock, pneumonia aspiration and respiratory failure during TP3. This patient received adalimumab-
Pfizer (in Humira-EU/Humira-EU/adalimumab-Pfizer group), but the death was reported to be related 
to a concomitant medication (meloxicam). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Injection site reaction (ISR) occurred more often with the US product than with the EU products in PK 
studies in healthy volunteers. In the PK study comparing two devices, the ISRs occurred equally as 
often in both groups, and no remarkable differences were observed in the injection site pain 
assessment in relation to two different devices or two injection sites. In the clinical study in RA 
patients, ISRs did not differ between the treatment groups (1.7% vs 2%). Hypersensitivity AEs were 
less often seen in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm than in the Humira-EU arm in B5381002 TP1; in TP2, the 
trend was similar. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported in clinical trials. 
The incidence of latent tuberculosis (TB) was greater in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm than in the 
Humira-EU arm (5 vs. 1 cases) in B5381002 TP1. (These led to study discontinuation.) In TP2, the 
latent TB cases were more equally divided between the study arms. On the other hand, in the one-year 
safety set the incidence of latent TB was again greater in the adalimumab-Pfizer group 7 (2.4 per 100 
patient-years) than in the Humira-EU group 3 (1.4 per 100 patient-years). However, the difference 
between treatments was statistically non-significant being on the same level with the other 
adalimumab biosimilars in adalimumab-Pfizer. Furthermore, the specificity of the QuantiFERON-TB test 
for TB latency is limited and false positives might occur in the follow up examinations. One case of 
latent tuberculosis was seen in the group receiving adalimumab-Pfizer only during TP3. 
After infections and infestations (that were equally distributed between study groups), blood and 
lymphatic system events were the most commonly reported targeted medical events (TMEs), and 
anaemia, neutropenia and leukopenia the most common AE types among them in TP1. Serious 
anaemia and pancytopenia were each reported by 1 (0.3%) subject in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm. In 
TP 2, these AE types were more equally divided between the study arms. No SAEs were reported under 
the TME category of Blood and Lymphatic System in TP2. 
In general, it seems that the adverse events of special interest / TMEs occurred in the beginning of the 
safety follow-up, i.e. in TP1. Neoplasms were seen also in TP2, which is natural in relation to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 91/112 
 
 
 
 
nature of the AE. Switching the product did not seem to increase the risk of adverse events of special 
interest / TMEs, although the incidence of the most common event type, infections and infestations, 
was somewhat higher in Humira-EU/adalimumab-Pfizer arm (21.1%) than in other arms in TP2 (17% 
and 17.3% in Humira-EU/Humira-EU and adalimumab-Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer arms). 
Laboratory findings 
In Study B5381001, across all treatment arms, the most frequent haematological abnormality was 
decreased white blood cells, while the most frequent chemistry abnormality was increased creatinine. 
No subjects in the adalimumab-Pfizer group experienced laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or 
greater. 
In Study B5381007, the most frequent haematological abnormality was neutrophil count decreased, 
while the most frequent chemistry abnormality reported was increased creatinine. By severity, the 
most prominent chemistry abnormality was increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), across all 
treatment arms. 
In Study B5381005, both in pre-filled syringe (PFS) and pre-filled pen (PFP) treatment arms, the most 
frequent haematological abnormalities reported were neutrophil count decreased and white blood cells 
decreased, while the most frequent chemistry abnormality was creatinine increased. 
No significant differences between-group were reported in laboratory parameters in the clinical study in 
RA patients (B5381002). The numbers of subjects who had abnormalities in total bilirubin, ALT and 
AST were comparable between the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU treatment arms in TP1. In TP2, 
the incidence rates of the abnormalities were low in all 3 treatment groups. 
In TP1, the majority of chemistry abnormalities were Grade 1-2. There were no events of chemistry 
laboratory values of Grade 5. Grade 3 results were reported as ALT, AST increased, hypercalcemia, 
hyperglycaemia, and hyponatremia. Grade 4 creatinine increased and hyperkalaemia were each 
experienced by 1 (0.3%) subject from the adalimumab-Pfizer arm and none was reported for the 
Humira-EU arm. Overall, for chemistry laboratory parameters, the numbers of subjects with 
abnormalities and severity of abnormalities were comparable between the adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU treatment arms.   
In TP2, the majority of abnormalities were of Grade 1-2; none were Grade 4. Grade 3 chemistry 
results were reported for ALT increased, hyponatremia, and hyperglycaemia. Overall, for chemistry 
parameters, the numbers of subjects with abnormalities and severity of abnormalities were comparable 
between the 3 treatment groups. 
In haematology parameters, most abnormalities were of Grade 1 or 2; none were Grade 4. Grade 3 
haematology results were reported for anaemia, lymphocyte count decreased, and neutrophil count 
decreased in TP1. The majority of the events of anaemia (7 of the 9 TEAEs) in the adalimumab-Pfizer 
arm were mild and Grade 1-2 severity. None of the 9 events of anaemia reported for subjects in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer arm was assessed as related to the study drug. 
In TP2, the majority of haematology abnormalities were Grade 1-2. Grade 4 haematology results were 
reported for lymphocyte count decreased. Grade 3 haematology results were reported for lymphocyte 
count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, and anaemia. Overall, for haematology parameters, the 
numbers of subjects with abnormalities were small and the severity of the abnormalities was 
comparable between the 3 treatment groups. 
In total, no more than two Grade 4 AEs related to laboratory findings in Study B5381002. One of them 
was an anaemia case in the adalimumab-Pfizer treatment arm in TP1 that was classified as a SAE. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 92/112 
 
 
 
 
other one was a lymphopenia case in the Humira-EU/Humira-EU treatment arm in TP2. The latter was 
alleviated to Grade 2 and thus assessed as a non-serious AE by the investigator. 
Immunological events 
The immunogenicity of Amsparity was compared to the reference product Humira in the 4 same 
previously mentioned studies (B5381001, B5381007, B5381005, B5381002). Blood samples for the 
detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralising antibody (Nab) were collected at pre specified 
times before and during treatment, and at extended follow-up based on study duration. Serum 
samples collected for ADA assessment were tested for ADA, and samples that were confirmed positive 
for ADA were further tested for NAb. See Section 2.5.2. Pharmacokinetics for assessment of analytical 
methods. 
In  this  section,  impact  of  immunogenicity  on  PK  and  safety  is  discussed.  See  Section  2.6.  Clinical 
efficacy for results regarding impact of immunogenicity on efficacy. 
Table 34 summarises the results of these studies in terms of percentage of ADA and NAb. 
Table 34 Percentage of patients with ADA and Nab by studies 
Immunogenicity in healthy subjects 
The overall percentage of ADA was very high in healthy subjects after administration of a single 40mg 
SC dose of adalimumab in both single-dose PK studies. A majority of ADA-positive subjects also tested 
positive for NAb. Percentage of ADA was numerically lower in the adalimumab-Pfizer group in 
comparison with the Humira-EU group in one of the PK-studies (B5381001: 85.5% vs 90%) and higher 
in the other PK-study (B5381007; 76.5 vs 70.3%). The same trend can be seen in the percentage of 
NAb. 
The development of ADA/NAb affected the PK of adalimumab in all three study arms in studies 
B5381001 and B5381007, especially the elimination phase (AUCt and AUCinf) and had less impact on 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 93/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the PK parameters that reflect the absorption phase (Cmax, AUC0-2wk). It is expectable that the impact 
of ADA on PK increases as the time from injection increases, as more subjects turn ADA-positive. 
In study B5381005 (comparison of PFS and PFP), ADA and NAb were tested only on the samples from 
subjects where there was a need for the data to help interpret the PK or safety results. No 
immunogenicity testing was needed for interpretation of PK. Therefore, immunogenicity testing was 
only performed on subjects with an injection site reaction (ISR) and/or rash AE and randomly selected 
control subjects from the same study arm, who did not experience ISR or rash AEs, matched to the 
test subjects (by age, gender, weight and device). The test subjects included 8 PFS and 7 PFP subjects 
with AEs of injection site reaction (ISR) and/or rash, and respective control subjects. A majority (12) of 
the 18 subjects with who tested positive for ADA also tested positive for NAb; 7/11 of ISR and/or rash 
AE subjects and 5/7 of matched control subjects were NAb-positive. The overall percentage NAb were 
comparable among patients with ISR and/or Rash AE (63.6%) and without ISR and/or Rash AE 
(71.4%). 
Immunogenicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
Immunogenicity of adalimumab-Pfizer was compared with Humira-EU in patients with RA in study 
B5381002 as a secondary endpoint during the two blinded treatment periods (TP1 up to week 26 and 
TP2 up to week 52). The percentage of ADA-positive subjects was lower in RA patients than in the 
studies conducted in healthy volunteers. This is in line with published literature on RA patients and 
may be due to the concomitant methotrexate medication and/or the treated condition, RA. 
During TP1 (26 weeks, 297 patients in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm and 299 in the Humira-EU arm), the 
evolution of ADA was overall similar in the two study arms. Numerically, there were more ADA- 
positive subjects in the Humira-EU arm (50.5%) than in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm (44.4%). 
However, the percentage of NAb-positive subjects of the total study cohort was similar: 13.8% of 
subjects administered adalimumab-Pfizer and 14.0% of subjects administered Humira-EU. 
During TP2, comparable percentage of ADA and titres were observed in the groups switching or 
continuing in TP2 the treatment received in TP1. The overall TP1 + TP2 (1 year) percentage of a 
positive ADA test result in the TP2 safety population was 52.3%, 59.3% and 49.6% for the 
Adalimumab-Pfizer/ Adalimumab-Pfizer, Humira-EU/Humira-EU, and Humira-EU/Adalimumab-Pfizer 
groups, respectively. Specifically, for the switching group (Humira-EU/Adalimumab-Pfizer) as 
compared to the Humira-EU group that did not switch, the increase in ADA percentage over TP2 for 
subjects with an ADA test sample was not higher: 0.8% (from 45.1% to 45.9%) versus 6.7% (from 
47.4% to 54.1%), respectively.       
The NAb percentage in ADA-positive subjects with RA was comparable among the treatment groups, 
with the majority of ADA-positive subjects testing negative for NAb. Comparable NAb titres were 
observed in all groups; however, there was high inter-subject variability. 
Impact of immunogenicity on safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy 
Safety 
Immunogenicity did not affect safety in the clinical study in RA patients or in either of the single-dose 
PK studies. Only in the device comparison study B5381005 it could be seen that injection-site reactions 
and rash were somewhat more frequent in patients with ADA. On the other hand, the frequency of 
hypersensitivity reactions was low in all clinical studies, even though a majority of study subjects 
turned ADA-positive. There were no significant differences seen in immunogenic safety events between 
the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU-groups.

Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, in the first PK-study B5381001 that did not meet the formal bioequivalence criteria (with 
higher exposure to adalimumab-Pfizer compared to Humira-EU), the percentage of ADAs was slightly 
lower (85,5% versus 90%) for adalimumab-Pfizer compared to Humira-EU, which would be in line with 
the faster elimination in ADA-positive patients and could have played a role in the failed bioequivalence 
result. Opposite to that, in the other PK-study B5381007, the percentage of ADAs was slightly higher 
in the adalimumab-Pfizer group compared to Humira-EU group (76.5% versus 70.3%), which could 
have also played some role. Further, in study B5381002 in RA-patients, patients treated with 
adalimumab-Pfizer had slightly lower percentage of ADAs (44.4% versus 50.5% in the Humira-EU 
group), which finding could corroborate with the higher serum trough concentrations seen in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer group. It is noteworthy that the difference in median serum concentrations between 
the two treatment arms was markedly higher in ADA-positive than ADA-negative patients, the 
difference of which explanation though remains unclear. 
As a conclusion, the percentage of ADA was not concordantly different between adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira EU across the clinical trials; in studies B5381001 and B5381002 the percentage of ADA was 
slightly higher in the Humira-EU group, but the opposite was true in study B5381007. The differences 
in trough concentrations seemed to be partially in line with the differences in the percentage of ADA- 
positive subjects, although the difference cannot be solely accounted by immunogenicity, as the 
percentage of ADA and NAb in the adalimumab-Pfizer arms was not consistently lower than in 
originator arms. Furthermore, the sampling period for the PK studies did not cover the entire PK 
profile. Hence, the impact of ADA on elimination phase was not fully covered.  
Finally, for better understanding of the impact of ADA and NAb on adalimumab exposure after the 
initial 2 week phase after administration in each study group, the applicant was requested to calculate 
the AUC2wk-inf for ADA/Nab-negative and positive subjects and for the combined group, separately for 
all three study groups (adalimumab-Pfizer, Humira-EU and Humira-US) in studies B5381001 and 
B5381007. In addition, a sensitivity and statistical analysis on all PK parameters (including elimination 
half-life) in the ADA-negative subgroup to be able to evaluate more clearly the comparability of 
adalimumab pharmacokinetics was requested. The applicant provided the results of descriptive 
statistics and statistical analyses for studies B5381001 and B5381007 for AUC2wk-inf, Cmax, AUC0-2wk, 
AUCt, AUCinf and t½ for all subjects combined, anti-drug antibody (ADA) negative subjects, and ADA 
positive subjects for all three study groups (adalimumab-Pfizer, Humira-EU and Humira-US) in both 
studies. 
In the study B5381001, it was observed that the 90%CIs in almost all PK parameters were wide 
regardless of treatment comparison or ADA status. In the ADA-positive subjects, although most of the 
GMRs were >100 %, most of the 90% CIs were been between 0.80−1.25 for all treatment 
comparisons. In the ADA-negative subjects, the adalimumab-Pfizer concentrations were higher than 
Humira-EU and Humira-US concentrations and all GMRs in exposure PK parameters were >100 %. The 
percentage of ADA-negative subjects was too small for drawing definitive conclusions in this subgroup. 
In the study B5381007, all 90% CIs in the studied PK parameters of the ADA-positive subjects and 
combined subjects were within 0.80-1.25 (although the range not always included 1.00). In the ADA-
negative group, the 90% CIs were wider in the studied PK parameters (most upper limits >1.25 and 
the most ranges did not include 1.00) than in the combined /ADA-positive subjects. The amount of 
ADA-negative subjects compared to the ADA-positive subjects was relatively small, therefore, no 
definitive conclusions in this subgroup of subjects can be drawn. 
The PK results provided support the earlier PK conclusions that adalimumab-Pfizer concentrations are 
higher (especially in ADA-negative subjects); however, the difference in the concentrations can be 
considered not to be clinically relevant.

Efficacy 
The subgroup analysis by ADA status showed similar ACR20 responses within ADA-positive and ADA-
negative and NAb-negative patients between treatment groups at Week 12. Instead, in NAb -positive 
patients the ACR20 response at week 12 was significantly higher in Humira-EU group (64.0%) 
compared to adalimumab-Pfizer group (50.0%); the difference was −14% (95% CI −39.6; 11.6). 
Although this difference in efficacy in NAb-positive patients might be related to low number of patients 
in this subgroup leading to the low precision and wide CI, the Applicant was requested to demonstrate 
the temporal impact of the ADA- and NAb positivity on efficacy in RA patients and whether withering 
effect is present in ADA- or NAb-positive patients. The additional analyses showed marked decrease in 
the (non-significant) difference in ACR20 response rate from week 12 to week 26, to a clinically non-
relevant level. Analyses performed with the more sensitive DAS28-4(CRP) endpoint showed no 
withering effect or trending down overtime in Nab positive subjects. The observed slight differences in 
treatment response between adalimumab-Pfizer and adalimumab-EU groups are deemed clinically non-
relevant and not to preclude biosimilarity (see 2.6.3. ). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs in the PK studies (Table 20, Table 21, Table 22).  
In the comparative safety and efficacy study (B5381002) in general, all discontinuation types (i.e. 
Subjects with temporary discontinuation due to AEs; Subjects discontinued from treatment due to AEs; 
Subjects discontinued from study due to AEs) were slightly fewer in the adalimumab-Pfizer arm than in 
the Humira-EU arm in TP 1 (Table 26). The same applies also to one-year safety data of TP1. In TP2, 
these end-points were seen the most often in those who received Humira-EU/Humira-EU and the less 
often in those who switched from Humira-EU to adalimumab-Pfizer (Table 27). These differences were, 
however, small. In TP3, the greatest numbers were in the Humira-EU/Humira/EU-adalimumab-Pfizer 
group, but again the between-group differences were small (Table 31). Permanent treatment 
discontinuation in TP1 due to SAEs was seen in 10 subjects: in 3 receiving adalimumab-Pfizer and in 7 
receiving Humira-EU. 
On the other hand, even if the discontinuation due to AEs in TP1 was less common in the adalimumab-
Pfizer group, the incidences due to the most common reasons were more common in this group 
compared to the Humira-EU group: Infections and infestations 2.7% vs. 1.0% among which latent TB 
1.7% vs. 0.3%, respectively, for permanent discontinuation from the study. 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of adalimumab-Pfizer was investigated in four clinical studies (B5381001, B5381007, 
B5381005, B5381002).  
The number of subjects (altogether 773 healthy volunteers out of which 354 were administered 
adalimumab-Pfizer; and 596 RA patients out of which 430 were administered adalimumab-Pfizer, and 
among which the compliance was high) is sufficient for comparing the safety profile of the biosimilar 
candidate and reference medicinal product (Humira-EU), and studying the safety of a biosimilar 
product for up to one year. This is in line with the EMA guideline to establish immunogenicity of 
biosimilar product, as well as with the given scientific advice. 
A pooled safety analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of study populations (RA patients 
versus healthy subjects) and the difference in duration of treatment/exposure (multiple doses versus 
single-dose), which is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 96/112 
 
 
 
 
In the PK study B5381001, subjects with AEs were fewer in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the 
Humira-EU group (46.4% and 62.9%), whereas in the PK study B5381007 the corresponding figures 
were 57% and 43%, these differences hence reflecting possibly chance findings. Treatment-related 
TEAEs were reported more often in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the Humira-EU group (55 and 
35 subjects), with no clear clustering of TEAEs; however, a slight imbalance was seen in coughs (9.1% 
and 1.7%) but considered of no clinical relevance here. Proportion of subjects with AEs and receiving 
adalimumab-Pfizer was smaller in study B5381005 than it was in study B5381001 or in study 
B5381007. 
In RA patients, the AE incidences were similar in patients receiving adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU 
in TP1 and TP2. The most frequently reported AEs were viral upper respiratory tract infection, 
headache, anaemia, ALT increased, and hypertension. All these are in line with the known safety 
profile of Humira. There were 8 (2.7%) AEs of Grade 3 or higher related to the treatment in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer arm and 9 (3.0%) in Humira-EU arm in TP1. In TP2, there were only single AEs of 
Grade 3 or higher related to the treatment. 
Injection site reactions occurred more often with the US product than with the EU products in PK 
studies in healthy volunteers; in RA-patients the incidence of ISR was very similar (1.7% and 2.0%) in 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups (in TP1). In the PK study comparing two devices, the ISRs 
occurred equally as often in both groups, and no notable differences were observed in the injection site 
pain assessment in relation to two different devices or two injection sites. 
There was slight imbalance in the incidence of latent TB between the adalimumab-Pfizer and the 
Humira-EU arm (5 vs. 1 cases) in B5381002 TP1. In TP2, the latent TB cases were more equally 
divided between the study arms. On the other hand, in the one-year safety set the incidence of latent 
TB was again greater in the adalimumab-Pfizer group than in the Humira-EU group (7 cases, 2.4/100 
patient years vs 3 cases, 1.3/100 patient years). In TP3, one case of latent TB was seen in a patient 
receiving adalimumab-Pfizer only. TB is an identified risk in the risk management plan (RMP) and will 
be followed in post-marketing. 
In general, it seems that the adverse events of special interest / target medical events (TMEs) 
occurred in the beginning of the safety follow-up, i.e. in TP1. Neoplasms were seen also in TP2, which 
is natural in relation to the nature of the AE. During TP3 and follow-up period, a total of 4 cases 
(including 2 SAEs) of neoplasms were reported: 2 cases each in the adalimumab-Pfizer/ adalimumab-
Pfizer/ adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU/Humira-EU/ adalimumab-Pfizer groups. Switching the 
product did not seem to increase the risk of adverse events of special interest / TMEs, although the 
incidence of the most common event type, infections and infestations, was slightly higher in Humira-
EU/adalimumab-Pfizer arm than in other arms in TP2. 
In PK studies, there was one SAE in the Humira-EU arm (study B5381001) and one SAE in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer arm (study B5381005). No SAEs were reported in study B5381007. 
In the clinical study in RA patients, one death was reported in the Humira-EU arm during TP1. Another 
death was due to SAEs of anaemia, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, shock, pneumonia aspiration 
and respiratory failure during TP3. This patient received adalimumab-Pfizer (in Humira-EU/Humira-
EU/adalimumab-Pfizer group) but the death was reported to be related to the concomitant medication 
meloxicam. SAEs occurred as often in both treatment arms during TP1. In TP2, the study patients in 
the adalimumab-Pfizer/adalimumab-Pfizer arm experienced SAEs less often than the study patients in 
the Humira-EU/Humira-EU arm. No subjects, who had changed from adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU 
suffered from SAEs. No significant between-group differences were seen in SAEs in TP3 and Follow-up. 
In the PK studies, there were alterations in laboratory data and chemistry laboratory data in 
parameters such as platelet count decreased, white blood cell decreased, anaemia, neutrophil count

decreased, haemoglobin increased, ALT increased, AST increased, CPK increased, creatinine increased, 
hyperglycaemia, hypernatremia, but these were not more highlighted in the adalimumab-Pfizer groups 
than in the Humira-EU groups. In addition, there were cases of Hypernatremia and Hypocalcaemia in 
B5381005. 
No  TEAEs  of  Blood  and  Lymphatic,  Investigations,  or  Metabolism  and  Nutrition  were  reported  for 
adalimumab-Pfizer  in  Study  B5381001.  Only  single  cases  of  these  TEAEs  in  relation  to  adalimumab-
Pfizer were seen in studies B5381007 and B5381005. 
No significant differences between-group were reported in laboratory parameters in the clinical study in 
RA patients. The numbers of subjects who had abnormalities in total bilirubin, ALT and AST were 
comparable between the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU treatment arms in TP1. In TP2, the 
incidence rates of the abnormalities were low in all 3 treatment groups. In TP1 and TP2, the majority 
of chemistry as well as haematology abnormalities were of Grade 1-2. In total, no more than two 
Grade 4 AEs related to laboratory findings in Study B5381002. 
In PK study B5381007 five pregnancy cases (3 female subjects, and 2 male subjects as exposed 
partners of pregnant women) were reported, but none of these subjects received adalimumab-Pfizer. 
No pregnancies were reported in studies B5381001, B5381005, or B5381002. The application concerns 
also indications in children, but as far as similar biological medicinal products are concerned, there is 
no requirement for special paediatric development. 
A great majority of patients developed ADA. Nevertheless, no anaphylaxis or other serious 
hypersensitivity reactions were seen; and allergic and hypersensitivity reactions were not frequent. In 
most of the clinical studies, no difference was seen in rash or ISR. Only in the device-comparison 
study, the 15 subjects with rash or ISR had somewhat higher prevalence of ADA in comparison with 
matched controls. As a conclusion on immunogenicity, the percentage of ADA was not concordantly 
different between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira EU across the clinical trials; in studies B5381001 and 
B5381002 the percentage of ADA was slightly higher in the Humira-EU group, but the opposite was 
true in study B5381007. 
Although discontinuation due to AEs in TP1 was less common in the adalimumab-Pfizer group, the 
incidences due to the most common reasons (infections and infestations, among which latent TB) were 
more common in this group compared to the Humira-EU group. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The number of subjects was sufficient for comparing the safety profile of the biosimilar candidate 
adalimumab-Pfizer and the reference medicinal product Humira-EU and studying the safety of a 
biosimilar product for up to one year, including comparative period of 52 weeks. The number, severity 
and type of SAEs, AEs of special interest, treatment discontinuations due to AEs, and laboratory 
findings were broadly comparable between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU, and in line with the 
known safety profile of Humira. The frequency of related AEs, severity of AEs and AEs of special 
interest remained relatively similar for the group who transitioned from Humira-EU to adalimumab-
Pfizer at week 26. There were no new or unexpected safety findings in TP3. With regard to 
immunogenicity, the percentage of ADAs was lower in the adalimumab-Pfizer group compared to the 
Humira-EU group (52.3% vs 59.3% at one year). 
In general, Amsparity seemed to be well-tolerated and the AE incidence was either at the same or 
lower level than that of the Humira-EU. Hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions and injection 
site pain were minor. 
The safety profiles of the original and biosimilar candidate appear to be similar.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Amsparity was developed as a biosimilar to the reference medicinal product Humira. The route of 
administration (subcutaneous), posology, and indications are according to the reference product as 
described in the Humira SmPC. 
The applicant applied for the same therapeutic indications as approved for the reference product 
Humira: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA), active enthesitis-
related arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), adult and paediatric plaque psoriasis (PsO), 
adult and paediatric Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), adult and adolescent hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS), adult and paediatric non-infectious uveitis (UV). 
The following presentations are proposed: solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (20 mg and 40 
mg), solution for injection (40 mg/0.8 ml) and solution for injection in pre-filled pen (40 mg). 
Summary of analytical comparability (quality data)  
The applicant performed a comprehensive similarity exercise which followed the general principles 
outlined in the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived 
proteins as active substance: quality issues” (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012).  
Sufficient Humira-EU and Humira-US products lots were compared to adalimumab-Pfizer and included 
in the similarity analyses.  
All methods and assays used are reported to be sensitive and suitable for evaluating biosimilarity, 
validation data is provided for the methods used also for routine release testing. In addition, 
qualification reports for biological activity assays have been provided. 
Analytical comparability studies included primary, secondary and higher order structures, post 
translational modifications (charge variants and glycan profiles), purity and impurities, quantity, 
biological activity in Fab and Fc related functions, and comparative stability studies. 
Summary of non-clinical data 
The applicant conducted comprehensive in vitro studies to address the similarity of key functional 
activities of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU (and Humira-US). The shortened nonclinical similarity 
exercise followed the guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and was in accordance 
with the overarching guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1). 
In addition to in vitro functional studies, a 1-month GLP compliant comparative toxicity and 
toxicokinetic study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys who received weekly subcutaneous dosing 
of 157 mg/kg of adalimumab-Pfizer of Humira-EU (study 12GR307).  
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 101/112 
 
 
 
 
 
The analytical method employed for determination of adalimumab in cynomolgus monkey serum was 
reported to be sensitive and suitable for assessment of similarity of exposure levels in cynomolgus 
monkey. The analytical method employed for determination of ADA positivity in cynomolgus monkey 
serum could have underestimated the ADA positivity due to the lack of drug tolerance testing. 
Summary of clinical comparability data 
Two PK studies (B5381001 and B5381007) were conducted: single-dose (40 mg SC) randomised, 
double-blind (Sponsor open), 3-arm parallel PK studies in healthy subjects comparing adalimumab-
Pfizer, Humira-EU and Humira-US (B5381001: N = 70 subjects randomised/arm, B5381007: N ~120 
subjects randomised/arm). Supportive PK data in patients with RA in the clinical efficacy and safety 
study B5381002 were also collected. 
A clinical efficacy and safety study (B5381002) was carried out: a 52-week (TP1 and TP2) randomised 
double-blind equivalence study comparing adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU (40 mg SC every 
2 weeks) in combination with MTX in subjects with moderately to severely active RA with inadequate 
response to MTX therapy (N=297 in adalimumab-Pfizer arm and N=299 in Humira-EU arm). Patients 
on Humira-EU arm in treatment period 1 (TP1) were re-randomised 1:1 at week 26 to continuation or 
switching to adalimumab-Pfizer (TP2). The primary outcome was ACR20 at Week 12, with an 
equivalence margin of +/- 14%. Secondary endpoints were safety, immunogenicity, PK, PD, and 
additional clinical response measures including ACR20 at visits other than Week 12, ACR50, ACR70, 
individual ACR components including HAQ-DI, DAS28-4 (CRP), EULAR response, DAS remission and 
ACR/EULAR remission. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality data 
High similarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU was demonstrated for the following quality 
attributes: 
- 
Primary structure 
-  Higher order structure 
-  Dimers, aggregations, and fragments 
-  Glycosylation, with the exception of total afucosylation and high mannose variants where 
differences are seen 
-  Charge variant profile 
-  Binding to sTNFα and mTNFα 
-  C1q binding and CDC activity 
The differences identified are further discussed in section 3.3.  
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 102/112 
 
 
 
 
Nonclinical data 
Regarding Fab-related activities similar binding to sTNFα and mTNFα, similar inhibition of TNFα 
-induced apoptosis activity (caspase 3/7 activity), similar reverse signalling activity on Jurkat cells and 
similar inhibition of ELAM-1 expression was demonstrated. 
Comparable Fc-related effector functions in vitro were demonstrated; similar ADCC activity using 
PBMNCs as effector cells, similar activity in FcγRIIIa RGA assay, similar inhibition of T-cell proliferation 
in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, similar CDC activity and C1q binding, and similar binding to FcγRI, 
FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIb and FcRn. 
Similar uptake to the mannose receptor expressing rat alveolar macrophages was demonstrated. 
Similar safety and TK profile was demonstrated in the cynomolgus monkeys. 
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK biosimilarity of adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU is supported by the PK data from studies 
B5381007 (although the point estimates were above 100%) and B5381002 (although the means of 
trough concentrations were slightly higher for adalimumab-Pfizer compared to Humira-EU). Also, the 
Cmax and AUC0-2wk when ANOVA was used in statistical analysis and PK data (i.e. Cmax, AUC0-2wk, AUCt 
and AUCinf) when ANCOVA (the weight as a covariate) was used in statistical analysis in the PK-study 
B5381001 support the biosimilarity of adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU. 
Furthermore, in the phase 3 study in RA patients at weeks 6, 12, 26 the differences in median serum 
concentrations between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU were 24%, 32%, 23% in ADA-positive 
patients, but only 2%, 2% and 10% in ADA-negative patients. The explanation of these differences 
remains unclear. Thus, when analysing only the ADA-negative patients, in the absence of interfering 
ADAs, the differences in the trough serum concentrations were very small; this supports biosimilarity 
from the PK point of view. 
Efficacy 
The data from the main efficacy and safety study of both primary and secondary endpoints support 
biosimilarity and equivalence between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU in subjects with moderately 
to severely active RA with inadequate response to MTX therapy. The proportion of subjects reaching 
ACR20 response at week 12 was similar being 68.4% (203/297) and 71.3% (214/2003) in the 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups, respectively. The point estimate for the ACR20 treatment 
difference at week 12 in ITT population was -2.98% and the 95% CI of the adjusted treatment 
difference was within the pre-defined equivalence margin of +/- 14% including 0 [-10.38%, 4.44%]. 
Similarly, the equivalence criteria were met also in PP population at week 12 with 71.1% (189/266) 
and 75.2% (191/254) of subjects reaching ACR20 in the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups, 
respectively. The point estimate for the difference was -4.14% and the 95% CI of the adjusted 
treatment difference was within the equivalence margin including 0 [-11.79%, 3.61%]. 
Also, in the continuous DAS-28 (CRP) parameter, although this data was only descriptive, the 
difference between the compared groups was smaller than the minimally clinically meaningful 
difference of 0.6 in each visit up to week 26. Furthermore, the secondary endpoints in ACR20, ACR50, 
and ACR70 showed similar largely overlapping response curves throughout the treatment period 1 and 
2, without significant difference in response rate after switching the treatments. No withering effect of 
the treatment response was present in any of the treatment arms. Finally, other secondary endpoints 
showed comparable results in all treatment groups in both treatment periods, TP1 and TP2. In TP3, 
efficacy was sustained and comparable clinical responses were observed among the subjects who

continued to receive adalimumab-Pfizer in TP3, and for the subjects who switched from Humira-EU to 
adalimumab-Pfizer at Week 52. 
Safety 
In the healthy volunteer PK-study B5381001 the frequency of the TEAEs was lower in the adalimumab-
Pfizer group compared to the Humira-EU group (46.4% vs. 62.9%), while in PK-study B5381007 the 
TEAEs were reported more often in adalimumab-Pfizer group compared to the Humira-EU group (57% 
vs. 40.3%). One SAE was reported in PK studies B5381001 (in Humira-EU group) and B5381005 (in 
adalimumab-Pfizer group). In the PK studies the number of injection site reactions (ISR) was equal in 
each group. 
In the pivotal Phase 3 study the adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups showed similar frequency of 
the AEs (TP1: 48.1% vs. 47.8% of the subjects experienced TEAEs; TP2: 43.5% vs. 44.4%) in each 
treatment period. The same was true also in the reported SAEs (TP1: 2.7% vs. 3.0% of the subjects 
experienced TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher, respectively; TP2: 1.4% vs. 4.4%, respectively). Additional 
data provided from TP3 and further follow-up period did not change the conclusions made based on 
TP1 and TP2 data. 
Latent TB were seen in TP1 with 5 observed cases in adalimumab-Pfizer group and 1 case in Humira-
EU group, but the numbers of affected were small and the difference between treatments statistically 
non-significant. In TP3, one case of latent TB was seen in a patient receiving adalimumab-Pfizer only. 
Of the AEs of special interest neoplasms occurred in similar incidence in both groups (5 in each) and 
similar frequency of the infections and infestations was observed (approximately 25% of subjects in 
each group) during the TP1. During TP3 and follow-up period, a total of 4 cases (including 2 SAEs) of 
neoplasms were reported: 2 cases each in the adalimumab-Pfizer/ adalimumab-Pfizer/ adalimumab-
Pfizer and Humira-EU/Humira-EU/ adalimumab-Pfizer groups. The equal incidence was also seen 
during the TP2. 
The number of ISRs was in general equal during the TP1 (1.7% and 2.0% in adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU groups, respectively). Only one case of ISR was seen in patients continuing with 
adalimumab-Pfizer during the TP2 and none in Humira-EU/Humira-EU group. 
The frequency of subjects developing ADAs was 85.5% vs. 90.0% (B5381001), 76.5% vs. 70.3% 
(B5381007) and 44.4% vs. 50.5% (B5381002, TP1) in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU groups, 
respectively. The corresponding figures in NAb development were 53.6% vs. 61.4% (B5381001), 
64.7% vs. 60.2% (B5381007) and 13.8% vs 14.0% (B5381002, TP1). The 1-year immunogenicity 
data (ADAs) in RA-patients showed similar results (52.3 vs 59.3%). No anaphylaxis or systemic 
allergic reactions were observed in any of these studies and the differences in the immunogenicity 
profiles were small in general. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality data and in vitro pharmacology data 
Uncertainties and limitations were identified for the following quality attributes and in vitro properties. 
They were subsequently addressed during the review with supporting clinical and non-clinical data. 
- The levels of high mannose variants differ. In the response to LoQ, the applicant has provided a 
literature-based discussion on the impact of high mannose variants on pharmacokinetics. Based on 
previous knowledge on literature and other anti-TNF products, the applicant’s conclusion can be 
agreed. The difference observed in high mannose content is minor and the impact on the PK of 
adalimumab is not expected to be significant. No uncertainties remain.

- Lower level of ADCC function correlating with lower levels of mannosylation/afucosylation. The 
applicant provided new data and discussion on the clinical relevance of the differences observed in 
ADCC activity. In conclusion, even though a difference in ADCC activity is observed between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU using the most sensitive assays based on NK or PBMC V/V effector 
cells, the ADCC assays believed to be more physiologically relevant show similar or lower but 
overlapping activity for adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. Furthermore, the data from IBD donor cells 
supports the conclusion that clinical relevance of the observed differences in ADCC activity is not 
expected to be significant. 
- In the response to the list of outstanding issues, the applicant provided new data to demonstrate the 
correlation between afucosylated levels with FcγRIIIa binding.  
Non-clinical data 
For uncertainties related to the comparative in vitro studies, please refer to the Uncertainties and 
limitations about biosimilarity Quality data. 
The TK profiles were comparable, but there was a tendency for higher exposures (AUC168 and Cmax) in 
animals treated with adalimumab-Pfizer in comparison to Humira-EU on day 22. The exposures were 
approximately 1.2 –fold higher in adalimumab-Pfizer treated animals. However, the study included 
only 3 cynomolgus monkeys/gender/treatment which limits the value of the study. 
The ADA formation in adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU treated cynomolgus monkeys was similar, but 
the ADA positivity could have been underestimated due to drug interference. 
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
Although there are supportive PK data for biosimilarity of adalimumab-Pfizer to Humira-EU, the first PK 
study B5381001 when ANOVA was used in statistical analysis failed to demonstrate the PK biosimilarity 
of adalimumab-Pfizer in AUCt and AUCinf to Humira-EU and another PK study (B5381007) with 
improved study design was performed. The biosimilarity was formally met in all primary PK parameters 
(i.e. the 90%CIs were within the 0.80-1.25% range); however, the 90%CIs in the Cmax and AUC0-2wk in 
comparison of adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU were above 100% and consequently not including 
the 100%. 
In addition, in both PK studies the sampling time for PK was too short to optimally characterisation of 
the whole PK profiles. However, in the study B5381007, the biosimilarity in PK can be considered 
formally met between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU and the PK results in this study can be 
considered to support biosimilarity. 
The mean concentrations of adalimumab-Pfizer were numerically slightly higher than the 
reference/comparator products in all clinical studies included in the dossier. However, these were not 
seen to have an impact on clinical efficacy or safety. 
Efficacy 
The number of involved centres/ countries/ regions was high in the main study. Furthermore, clear 
difference in ACR responses were seen depending on the geographic region. Nevertheless, based on 
the provided data from the single centres, no clear indication was seen that the overall efficacy 
outcome results would be driven by results from certain individual centres; the single centres being 
also small in the number of subjects recruited. 
Higher ACR20 response rate was seen in Humira-EU group compared to adalimumab-Pfizer group in 
NAb- positive subjects. The applicant submitted additional analyses demonstrating no clinically

relevant difference in efficacy as measured by the more sensitive DAS28-4(CRP) over time between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU, up to week 26, regardless of NAb/ADA status. 
Safety 
None 
Immunogenicity 
The percentage of ADA positivity was not concordantly different between adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira EU across the clinical trials; in studies B5381001 and B5381002 the percentage of ADA was 
slightly lower in the adalimumab-Pfizer group, but the opposite was true in study B5381007. Hence, 
the effect of immunogenicity on small differences in exposure between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-
EU (higher levels with the biosimilar candidate) is not fully clear. Furthermore, sampling times were 
too short for characterisation of the whole PK in studies B5381001, B5381005 and B5381007; and 
formation of ADA naturally affected most the elimination phase, as the percentage of ADA increased by 
time. Hence, the impact of immunogenicity on entire PK profile was not covered. Since the results on 
ADA percentage in the clinical studies in total did not indicate a constant difference in immunogenicity 
of adalimumab-Pfizer vs. Humira-EU and the slightly higher exposures of the biosimilar did not affect 
efficacy and safety, the lack of entire coverage of PK profile was not considered as crucial. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
On the quality level, a comprehensive biosimilarity exercise was performed following the general 
principles outlined in the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-
derived proteins as active substance: quality issues” (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012). The 
comparability exercise is mostly based on comparison of analytical characterisation data collected 
during the years of drug development. 
A lower level of afucosylated glycans, including high mannose glycans, was observed in adalimumab-
Pfizer batches. In general, therapeutic IgG containing high mannose glycans can be cleared more 
rapidly. According to the applicant, the differences in high mannose levels are not expected to have a 
clinical impact but may impact binding to mannose receptor and associated clearance. Mannose 
receptor binding was analysed as part of the non-clinical studies, and the results indicated that the 
mannose receptor in the test system used was not the major receptor mediating the adalimumab 
cellular uptake. Furthermore, no significant difference in mannose receptor uptake between the 
reference product (Humira-US was used in this assay) and adalimumab-Pfizer was observed. However, 
the sensitivity of this assay is questionable, thus the assay results were not considered reliable. 
Therefore, the relevance of the results generated using this assay is considered low. In responses to 
the list of question, the applicant provided literature-based discussion on the impact of high mannose 
variants on pharmacokinetics. Based on previous knowledge on literature and other anti-TNF products, 
the applicant’s conclusion can be agreed upon. The difference observed in high mannose content is 
minor and the impact on the PK of adalimumab is not expected to be significant. 
Adalimumab-Pfizer was less potent in triggering ADCC activity in the ADCC NK assay(FcyRIIIa 158 V/V 
genotype). Afucosylation levels were plotted against ADCC NK assay data demonstrating a correlation 
between low ADCC activities in batches with lower afucosylation. The applicant performed an additional 
assay with new NK donor cells. Based on this assay, it was argued by the applicant that the apparent 
sensitivity to total afucosylation observed in the primary NK ADCC assay is a characteristic of the 
individual donor cells used in that assay, as it is not reproduced with either of the other NK cell donors 
tested.

EMA/2756/2020

Even though ADCC activity effector functions are thought not to be involved in the primary mode of 
action and functionality of adalimumab, Fc functions could be important in certain indications. The 
applicant provided discussion and new data in their response with regards to differences observed in 
ADCC activity. It is concluded, that even though difference in the ADCC activity is observed between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU using the most sensitive assays based on NK or PBMC V/V effector 
cells, the ADCC assays, believed to be more physiologically relevant, show similar or lower, but 
overlapping activity for adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. Furthermore, the data from IBD donor cells 
supports the conclusion that clinical relevance of the observed differences in ADCC activity is not 
expected to be significant. 
Biosimilarity in the pivotal PK study B5381007 including healthy subjects has been formally 
demonstrated between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU as the primary parameters Cmax, AUCt and 
AUCinf, the 90% CI for the ratio of test-to-reference products fell within the acceptance range of 80.00-
125.00%. Also in the first PK study B5381001, the PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-2wk , the 90% CI for 
the ratio of test-to-reference products fell within the bioequivalence range, and in the exploratory 
analysis when weight was used as a covariate, all primary PK parameters were within 80.00-125.00% 
(including 100%). Additional support for similarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU was 
obtained in the study in RA patients (clinical study B5381002). The mean Ctrough concentrations were 
slightly higher with adalimumab-Pfizer than with Humira-EU; however, when taking into account the 
overlap in concentrations and high inter-patient variability (CVs ranging from 48-75% in TP1 and 65-
81% in TP2), the concentrations can be considered to be at comparable levels. The steady state mean 
trough concentrations were about 5-8 µg/ml as reported in RA patients with MTX in the Humira SmPC. 
The clinical efficacy and safety study was adequately designed and the primary and secondary 
outcome parameters and equivalence criteria correctly set. The clinical efficacy data was highly 
supportive for the similarity between adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU in both primary and secondary 
endpoints. The percentage of ADA was overall high in all studies, as expected for adalimumab. 
Differences in the percentage of ADA (85.5% versus 90% for adalimumab-Pfizer compared to Humira-
EU), together with timing of ADA formation, were thought by the applicant to contribute to the failure 
of the AUCt to meet the PK similarity criteria in the first PK study B5381001. However, in the other PK-
study B5381007 that formally met the bioequivalence criteria, the percentage of ADAs was slightly 
higher in the adalimumab-Pfizer group compared to Humira-EU group (76.5% versus 70.3%). It is 
agreed that ADA might have played some role in both PK studies; but to different directions. 
In RA-patients (B5381002), patients treated with adalimumab-Pfizer had slightly lower percentage of 
ADAs: 44.4% versus 50.5% in the Humira-EU group (TP1; at 1-year 52.3% vs 59.3%); though the 
percentage of NAb was comparable (13.8 vs. 14%). However, there was considerable overlap in serum 
drug concentrations between the treatment arms, with very high variability (CV% ranging from 49 to 
67%). Notably, the difference in median serum concentrations between the two RA patient groups was 
markedly higher in ADA-positive vs. ADA-negative patients (in the absence of interfering ADAs), the 
difference of which explanation remains unclear. Nevertheless, taking into account the discrepant 
results on ADA percentage in the clinical studies in total, current data do not indicate a constant 
difference in immunogenicity of adalimumab-Pfizer vs. Humira-EU, although somewhat lower ADA 
percentage (~6%) with the biosimilar candidate possibly could have played some role in two of the 
submitted studies in relation to the slightly higher exposures. 
The safety data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial indicated similar incidence of AEs, SAEs and the AEs of 
special interest (neoplasms, infections and infestations, ISRs) between the adalimumab-Pfizer and 
Humira-EU groups. No clear safety differences or issues were either detected in the 3 PK studies in the 
healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the developed ADAs and NAbs did not correlate with the 
hypersensitivity events, the frequency of which was low or non-existent in the clinical studies 
submitted and the differences between the immunogenicity profiles between the compared treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/2756/2020  
Page 107/112 
 
 
 
 
were small. Based on these results the safety data support biosimilarity. The applicant performed 
additional analyses on efficacy results in Nab and ADA positive and negative subgroups, comparing 
adalimumab Pfizer and adalimumab EU arm of study B5381002 to clarify the temporal relationship 
between the NAb development and potential lack of efficacy and whether differences between 
treatment groups are present. At week 12, there was a difference of 14% in ACR20 results in favour of 
adalimumab-EU. Nevertheless, the difference largely disappeared by time, and at 26 weeks there was 
a small, clinically and statistically non-significant difference (-0.813) in favour of adalimumab-EU. The 
evolution of DAS28-4 (CRP) values was closely similar in study B5381002 regardless of ADA status. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Regarding the quality characterisation and biofunctional assays the adequate parameters have been 
studied and appropriate methods used. These have included receptor binding assays, ADCC and CDC 
effector functions, reverse signalling, sTNFα apoptosis inhibition and regulatory macrophage activity 
assay. Furthermore, Vectra-DA descriptive comparison in 12 biomarkers (VCAM-1, TNFR-I, IL-6, EGF, 
VEGF, YKL-40, MMP-1, MMP-3, resistin, leptin, SAA, and CRP) showed comparability between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU. Sufficient justification and discussion were provided on the 
pathomechanistical aspects (e.g. cytokine profile) related to adult and adolescent hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS), adult and paediatric non-infectious uveitis (UV) indications and the impact of the 
slightly higher exposure in adalimumab-Pfizer to adalimumab-EU. Based on these data the 
extrapolation to all EU-Humira indications is acceptable. In quality, the difference in ADCC response 
between the products was seen by using sensitive method, but in more physiological assays no 
difference was recognised. The difference in ADCC is not considered to be clinically relevant and is not 
expected to have impact on extrapolation.  
Slight differences in PK were seen with the first PK study (B5381001) in healthy volunteers formally 
not meeting the equivalence criteria in AUCt and AUCinf. Also, the mean PK parameters (i.e. AUCs and 
Cmax) were numerically higher in adalimumab-Pfizer treatment group than in Humira-EU. In the second 
PK trial in healthy subjects (B5381007) the biosimilarity in PK was considered formally met between 
adalimumab-Pfizer and Humira-EU; however, the point estimates in exposure indicating PK parameters 
are all above 100% and lower boundary of 90% CI over 100% in Cmax and AUC0-2 wk. However, the 
slight numerically higher concentrations of adalimumab-Pfizer compared to the Humira-EU was not 
seen to have an impact on clinical efficacy or safety possibly indicating the dose level approved for the 
clinical use exceeding the maximal efficacy level reachable due to the saturation of the biological target 
for the treatment.  
The chosen model disease for the pivotal clinical Phase 3 study, i.e. the subjects with moderately to 
severely active RA with inadequate response to MTX therapy, is considered adequately sensitive and 
homogeneous population to support biosimilarity in all of the sought indications. Based on the efficacy 
trial data the similarity was shown in both primary and secondary outcomes. It was also shown that 
the treatment effect did not decline up to 76 weeks and the response rate profile was highly similar 
between treatment arms. Furthermore, the supportive sensitivity analyses showed similar outcome. 
Overall, comprehensive set of models have been presented on the quality, non-clinical and clinical level 
to support extrapolation to all indication of Humira.

3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Amsparity is considered biosimilar to Humira. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations

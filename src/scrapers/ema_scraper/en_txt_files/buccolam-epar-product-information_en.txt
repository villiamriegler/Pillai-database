Carers should only administer a single dose of midazolam. If the seizure has not stopped within 10 
minutes after administration of midazolam, emergency medical assistance must be sought and the 
empty syringe given to the healthcare professional to provide information on the dose received by the 
patient. 
A second or repeat dose when seizures re-occur after an initial response should not be given without 
prior medical advice (see section 5.2). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required, however, BUCCOLAM should be used with caution in patients with 
chronic renal failure as elimination of midazolam may be delayed and the effects prolonged. (see 
section 4.4) 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment reduces the clearance of midazolam with a subsequent increase in terminal half-
life. Therefore, the clinical effects may be stronger and prolonged, hence careful monitoring of the 
clinical effects and vital signs is recommended following administration of midazolam in patients with 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). 
BUCCOLAM is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of midazolam in children aged 0 to 3 months has not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
BUCCOLAM is for oromucosal use. The full amount of solution should be inserted slowly into the 
space between the gum and the cheek. Laryngo-tracheal insertion should be avoided to prevent 
accidental aspiration of the solution. If necessary (for larger volumes and/or smaller patients), 
approximately half the dose should be given slowly into one side of the mouth, then the other half 
given slowly into the other side.   
For detailed instructions on how to administer the medicinal product, see section 6.6.

Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
No needle, intravenous tubing or any other device for parenteral administration should be attached to 
the oral syringe. 
BUCCOLAM is not for intravenous use. 
The oral syringe cap should be removed before use to avoid risk of choking. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, benzodiazepines or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1 
Myasthenia gravis 
Severe respiratory insufficiency 
Sleep apnoea syndrome 
Severe hepatic impairment 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Respiratory insufficiency 
Midazolam should be used with caution in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency because 
midazolam may further depress respiration. 
Paediatric patients aged 3 to 6 months 
Given the higher metabolite to parent drug ratio in younger children, a delayed respiratory depression 
as a result of high active metabolite concentrations in the 3-6 months age group cannot be excluded. 
Therefore, the use of BUCCOLAM in the 3-6 month age group should be limited for use only under 
the supervision of a health care professional where resuscitation equipment is available and where 
respiratory function can be monitored and equipment for respiratory assistance, if needed, is available.  
Altered elimination of midazolam 
Midazolam should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure, impaired hepatic or 
cardiac function. Midazolam may accumulate in patients with chronic renal failure or impaired hepatic 
function whilst in patients with impaired cardiac function it may cause decreased clearance of 
midazolam. 
Concomitant use with other benzodiazepines 
Debilitated patients are more prone to the central nervous system (CNS) effects of benzodiazepines 
and, therefore, lower doses may be required. 
Medical history of alcohol or drug abuse 
Midazolam should be avoided in patients with a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse. 
Amnesia 
Midazolam may cause anterograde amnesia.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per oral syringe, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.     
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Midazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 have the potential to 
respectively increase and decrease the plasma concentrations and, subsequently, the effects of 
midazolam thus requiring dose adjustments accordingly. Pharmacokinetic interactions with CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers are more pronounced for oral as compared to oromucosal or parenteral 
midazolam as CYP3A4 enzymes are also present in the upper gastro-intestinal tract. After oromucosal 
administration, only systemic clearance will be affected. After a single dose of oromucosal 
midazolam, the consequence on the maximal clinical effect due to CYP3A4 inhibition will be minor 
while the duration of effect may be prolonged. Hence, a careful monitoring of the clinical effects and 
vital signs is recommended during the use of midazolam with a CYP3A4 inhibitor even after a single 
dose. 
Anaesthetics and narcotic analgesics  
Fentanyl may reduce midazolam clearance. 
Antiepileptics  
Co-administration with midazolam may cause enhanced sedation or respiratory or cardiovascular 
depression.  Midazolam may interact with other hepatically metabolised medicinal products, e.g. 
phenytoin, causing potentiation. 
Calcium-channel blockers 
Diltiazem and verapamil have been shown to reduce the clearance of midazolam and other 
benzodiazepines and may potentiate their actions. 
Ulcer-healing medicinal products 
Cimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole have been shown to reduce the clearance of midazolam and 
other benzodiazepines and may potentiate their actions. 
Xanthines 
Metabolism of midazolam and other benzodiazepines is accelerated by xanthines. 
Dopaminergic medicinal products 
Midazolam may cause inhibition of levodopa. 
Muscle relaxants 
E.g. baclofen. Midazolam may cause potentiation of muscle relaxants, with increased CNS depressant 
effects. 
Nabilone 
Co-administration with midazolam may cause enhanced sedation or respiratory and cardiovascular 
depression.

5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal product interactions following oromucosal administration of midazolam are likely to be 
similar to those observed after intravenous midazolam rather than oral administration. 
Food 
Grapefruit juice reduces the clearance of midazolam and potentiates its action. 
Azole antifungals 
Ketoconazole increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by 5-fold while the 
terminal half-life increased by about 3-fold. 
Voriconazole increased the exposure of intravenous midazolam by 3-fold whereas its elimination half-
life increased by about 3-fold. 
Fluconazole and itraconazole both increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by 2 
to 3-fold associated with an increase in terminal half-life by 2.4-fold for itraconazole and 1.5-fold for 
fluconazole. 
Posaconazole increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 2-fold. 
Macrolide antibiotics 
Erythromycin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 
1.6 to 2 –fold associated with an increase of the terminal half-life of midazolam by 1.5 to 1.8-fold. 
Clarithromycin increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by up to 2.5-fold 
associated with an increase in terminal half-life by 1.5 to 2-fold. 
HIV Protease inhibitors 
Co-administration with protease inhibitors (e.g. Saquinavir and other HIV protease inhibitors) may 
cause a large increase in the concentration of midazolam. Upon co-administration with ritonavir-
boosted lopinavir, the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam increased by 5.4-fold, 
associated with a similar increase in terminal half-life. 
Calcium-channel blockers 
A single dose of diltiazem increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 
25% and the terminal half-life was prolonged by 43%. 
Various medicinal products 
Atorvastatin showed a 1.4-fold increase in plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam compared 
to control group. 
Medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 
Rifampicin  
7 days of 600 mg once daily decreased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 
60%. The terminal half-life decreased by about 50-60%. 
Herbs 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
St John’s Wort decreased plasma concentrations of midazolam by about 20-40% associated with a 
decrease in terminal half life of about 15-17%.  Depending on the specific St John's Wort extract, the 
CYP3A4-inducing effect may vary. 
Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) 
The co-administration of midazolam with other sedative/hypnotic medicinal products and CNS 
depressants, including alcohol, is likely to result in enhanced sedation and respiratory depression. 
Examples include opiate derivatives (used as analgesics, antitussives or substitutive treatments), 
antipsychotics, other benzodiazepines used as anxiolytics or hypnotics, barbiturates, propofol, 
ketamine, etomidate; sedative antidepressants, non-recent H1-antihistamines and centrally acting 
antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Alcohol (including alcohol-containing medicinal products may markedly enhance the sedative effect 
of midazolam. Alcohol intake should be strongly avoided in case of midazolam administration (see 
section 4.4). 
Midazolam decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalation anaesthetics. 
The effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors may be larger in infants since part of the oromucosal dose is 
probably swallowed and absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of midazolam in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate a teratogenic effect with respect to reproductive toxicity, but foetotoxicity has been 
observed in humans as with other benzodiazepines. No data on exposed pregnancies are available for 
the first two trimesters of pregnancy. 
The administration of high doses of midazolam in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour has 
been reported to produce maternal or foetal adverse reactions (risk of aspiration of fluids and stomach 
contents during labour in the mother, irregularities in the foetal heart rate, hypotonia, poor suckling, 
hypothermia and respiratory depression in the new-born infant). 
Midazolam may be used during pregnancy if clearly necessary. The risk for new-born infants should 
be taken into account in the event of administration of midazolam in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Midazolam is excreted in low quantities (0.6%) in human milk. As a result it may not be necessary to 
stop breast feeding following a single dose of midazolam. 
Fertility 
Animal studies did not show an impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Midazolam has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Sedation, amnesia, impaired attention and impaired muscular function may adversely affect the ability 
to drive, ride a bicycle or use machines. After receiving midazolam, the patient should be warned not 
to drive a vehicle or operate a machine until completely recovered.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Published clinical studies show that oromucosal midazolam was administered to approx 443 children 
with seizures. Respiratory depression occurs at a rate of up to 5%, although this is a known 
complication of convulsive seizures as well as being related to midazolam use. One episode of pruritus 
was possibly attributed to the use of buccal midazolam.

Life-threatening incidents are more likely to occur in those with pre-existing respiratory insufficiency 
or impaired cardiac function, particularly when a high dosage is administered (see section 4.4).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Midazolam overdose can present a threat to life if the patient has pre-existing respiratory or cardiac 
insufficiency, or when combined with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). 
Overdose of benzodiazepines is usually manifested by degrees of central nervous system depression 
ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild cases, symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion and 
lethargy, in more serious cases, symptoms may include ataxia, hypotonia, hypotension, respiratory 
depression, rarely coma and very rarely death. 
Management 
In the management of overdose with any medicinal product, it should be borne in mind that multiple 
agents may have been taken. 
Following overdose with oral midazolam, vomiting should be induced (within one hour) if the patient 
is conscious or gastric lavage undertaken with the airway protected if the patient is unconscious. If 
there is no advantage in emptying the stomach, activated charcoal should be given to reduce 
absorption. Special attention should be paid to respiratory and cardiovascular functions in intensive 
care. 
Flumazenil may be useful as an antidote.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, benzodiazepine derivatives ATC code: N05CD08. 
Mechanism of action 
Midazolam is a derivative of the imidazobenzodiazepine group. The free base is a lipophilic substance 
with low solubility in water. The basic nitrogen in position 2 of the imidazobenzodiazepine ring 
system enables midazolam to form the hydrochloride salt with acids. These produce a stable solution 
suitable for oromucosal administration. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacological action of midazolam is characterized by short duration because of rapid 
metabolic transformation. Midazolam has an anticonvulsant effect.  It also exerts a sedative and sleep-
inducing effect of pronounced intensity, and an anxiolytic and a muscle-relaxant effect.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
In 4 rectal diazepam controlled studies and one study versus intravenous diazepam, in a total of 688 
children, cessation of visible signs of seizures within 10 minutes was observed in 65% to 78% of 
children receiving oromucosal midazolam. Additionally, in 2 of the studies, cessation of visible signs 
of seizures within 10 minutes without recurrence within 1 hour after administration was observed in 
56% to 70% of children. The frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions reported for 
Oromucosal midazolam during published clinical trials were similar to the adverse drug reactions 
reported in the comparative group using rectal diazepam. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
BUCCOLAM in the subset of the paediatric population < 3months old, on the grounds that the 
specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments 
for these paediatric patients.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties

Absorption 
After oromucosal administration midazolam is absorbed rapidly. Maximum plasma concentration is 
reached within 30 minutes in children. The absolute bioavailability of oromucosal midazolam is about 
75% in adults. The bioavailability of oromucosal midazolam has been estimated at 87% in children 
with severe malaria and convulsions. 
Distribution 
Midazolam is highly lipophilic and distributes extensively. The steady state volume of distribution 
following oromucosal administration is estimated to be 5.3 l/kg.  
Approximately 96-98% of midazolam is bound to plasma proteins. The major fraction of plasma 
protein binding is due to albumin. There is a slow and insignificant passage of midazolam into the 
cerebrospinal fluid. In humans, midazolam has been shown to cross the placenta slowly and to enter 
foetal circulation. Small quantities of midazolam are found in human milk. 
Biotransformation 
Midazolam is almost entirely eliminated by biotransformation.  The fraction of the dose extracted by 
the liver has been estimated to be 30-60%.  Midazolam is hydroxylated by the cytochrome P4503A4 
isozyme and the major urinary and plasma metabolite is alpha-hydroxy-midazolam.  Following 
oromucosal administration in children the area under the curve ratio for alpha-hydroxy midazolam to 
midazolam is 0.46.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a population pharmacokinetic study, the metabolite levels are shown to be higher in younger than 
older paediatric patients and thus likely to be of more importance in children than in adults. 
Elimination 
Plasma clearance of midazolam in children following oromucosal administration is 30 ml/kg/min. The 
initial and terminal elimination half-lives are 27 and 204 minutes, respectively.  Midazolam is excreted 
mainly by the renal route (60-80% of the injected dose) and recovered as glucuroconjugated alpha-
hydroxy-midazolam.  Less than 1% of the dose is recovered in urine as unchanged medicinal product. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Obese 
The mean half-life is greater in obese than in non-obese patients (5.9 versus 2.3 hours). This is due to 
an increase of approximately 50% in the volume of distribution corrected for total body weight. The 
clearance is not significantly different in obese and non-obese patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
The elimination half-life in cirrhotic patients may be longer and the clearance lower as compared to 
those in healthy volunteers (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
The elimination half-life in patients with chronic renal failure is similar to that in healthy 
volunteers. 
The elimination half-life of midazolam is prolonged up to six times in the critically ill. 
Cardiac insufficiency 
The elimination half-life is longer in patients with congestive heart failure compared with that in 
healthy subjects (see section 4.4). 
Exposure following a second dose in the same seizure episode 
Simulated exposure data show that the overall AUC approximately doubles when a second dose is 
administered at 10, 30 and 60 minutes following the first dose. A second dose at 10 minutes results in 
a significant increase in mean Cmax of between 1.7 to 1.9 fold. At 30 and 60 minutes, significant 
elimination of midazolam has already occurred and therefore the increase in mean Cmax is less 
pronounced; 1.3 to 1.6 and 1.2 to 1.5 fold respectively. (see section 4.2). 
Race 
Clinical studies have included patients from Japanese and non-Japanese groups, and no differences in 
the pharmacokinetic profile have been identified on exposure to Buccolam.  
No dose adjustment is warranted. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In a rat fertility study, animals dosed up to ten times the clinical dose, no adverse effects on fertility 
were observed.

There are no other preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to that already 
included in other sections of the SmPC.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for your child. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as those of the child for whom this medicine has been 
prescribed. 
If you see any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What BUCCOLAM is and what it is used for 
BUCCOLAM contains a medicine called midazolam. Midazolam belongs to a group of medicines 
known as benzodiazepines. BUCCOLAM is used to stop a sudden, prolonged, convulsive, seizure in 
infants, toddlers, children and adolescents (from 3 months to less than 18 years of age). 
In infants from 3 months to less than 6 months it should only be used in a hospital setting where 
monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available. 
This medicine must only be used by parents/carers where the child has been diagnosed to have 
epilepsy. 
2.  What you need to know before you give BUCCOLAM 
Do not give BUCCOLAM if the patient has: 
• 
• 
An allergy to midazolam, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6) 
A disease of the nerves and muscles causing muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis) 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Severe difficulty breathing at rest (BUCCOLAM can make breathing difficulties worse) 
An illness causing frequent interruption of breathing during sleep (sleep apnoea syndrome) 
Severe liver problems. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving BUCCOLAM if the patient has: 
• 
• 
A kidney, liver or heart condition 
A lung condition that causes difficulty breathing on a regular basis. 
This medicine may cause people to forget what happened after they have been given it. Patients should 
be observed carefully after being given the medicine. 
This medicine should be avoided in patients with a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse. 
Life threatening incidents are more likely in patients with breathing difficulties or heart problems, 
especially when higher doses of BUCCOLAM are given.  
Children younger than 3 months: BUCCOLAM should not be given to children younger than 3 
months since there is not enough information in this age group. 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to the patient, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before 
giving this medicine. 
Other medicines and BUCCOLAM 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the patient is taking, or has recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. If you have any doubt about whether any medicine the patient is taking may affect the use 
of BUCCOLAM, please speak to your doctor or pharmacist.  
This is extremely important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or 
weaken the effect of the medicines involved.  
The effects of BUCCOLAM may be intensified by medicines such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
antiepileptics, (for treating epilepsy) e.g. phenytoin 
antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin  
antifungals, e.g. ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, pozaconazole  
anti-ulcer medicines, e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole  
medicines used to treat blood pressure, e.g. diltiazem, verapamil 
some medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS, e.g. saquinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combination 
narcotic analgesics (very strong pain killers), e.g. fentanyl  
medicines used to reduce fat in the blood, e.g. atorvastatin 
medicines used to treat nausea, e.g. nabilone 
hypnotics (sleep inducing medicines) 
sedative antidepressants (medicines used to treat depression that make you sleepy) 
sedatives (medicines that relax you) 
anaesthetics (for pain relief) 
antihistamines (to treat allergies). 
The effects of BUCCOLAM may be reduced by medicines such as: 
• 
• 
• 
rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) 
xanthines (used to treat asthma)  
St John’s Wort (a herbal medicine). This should be avoided in patients taking BUCCOLAM. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BUCCOLAM may increase the effect of some muscle relaxants e.g. baclofen (causing increased 
drowsiness). This medicine may also stop some other medicines from working as well, e.g. levodopa 
(used to treat Parkinson’s disease). 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about medicines the patient should avoid whilst taking 
BUCCOLAM. 
BUCCOLAM with food and drink 
The patient must not drink alcohol while taking BUCCOLAM. Alcohol may increase the sedative 
effects of this medicine and make them very sleepy. 
The patient must not drink grapefruit juice while taking BUCCOLAM. Grapefruit juice may increase 
the sedative effects of this medicine and make them very sleepy. 
Pregnancy 
If the patient who will be given this medicine is pregnant or breast-feeding, thinks she may be 
pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask a doctor for advice before taking this medicine.   
Giving high doses of BUCCOLAM during the last 3 months of pregnancy can cause abnormal heart 
beat in the unborn child. Babies born after this medicine is administered during childbirth can also 
have poor suckling, breathing difficulties and poor muscle tone at birth. 
Breast-feeding  
Tell the doctor if the patient is breast-feeding. Even though small amounts of BUCCOLAM may pass 
into breast milk, it may not be necessary to stop breast-feeding. The doctor will advise if the patient 
should breast-feed after being given this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
BUCCOLAM may make the patient sleepy, forgetful or affect their concentration and co-ordination. 
This may affect their performance at skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. 
After receiving this medicine, the patient should not drive a vehicle, ride a bicycle or operate a 
machine until they have completely recovered. Please discuss with your doctor if you need further 
advice. 
BUCCOLAM contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per oral syringe, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.     
3. 
How to give BUCCOLAM 
Always give this medicine exactly as a doctor has told you. Check with a doctor or pharmacist if you

them if they are in danger from, for example, deep water, fire or sharp objects. 
Support your child’s head with something soft, such as a cushion or your lap. 
Check that the medicine is the correct dose for your child, according to their age.

4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment with Vizimpro should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
EGFR mutation status should be established prior to initiation of dacomitinib therapy (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Vizimpro is 45 mg taken orally once daily, until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. If the 
patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken and the next prescribed dose 
should be taken at the usual time the next day. 
Dose modifications 
Dose modifications may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is 
necessary, then the dose of Vizimpro should be reduced as described in Table 1. Dose modification 
and management guidelines for specific adverse reactions are provided in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8).

Dose modification 
•  Withhold dacomitinib during ILD/Pneumonitis diagnostic evaluation. 
•  Permanently discontinue dacomitinib if ILD/Pneumonitis is 
confirmed. 
•  For Grade 1 diarrhoea, no dose modification is required. Initiate 
treatment with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., loperamide) at 
first onset of diarrhoea. Encourage adequate oral fluid intake during 
diarrhoea. 
•  For Grade 2 diarrhoea, if not improved to Grade ≤ 1 within 24 hours 
while using anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., loperamide) and 
adequate oral fluid intake, withhold dacomitinib. Upon recovery to 
Grade ≤ 1, resume dacomitinib at the same dose level or consider a 
reduction of 1 dose level. 
•  For Grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea, withhold dacomitinib. Treat with 
anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., loperamide), and adequate 
oral fluid intake or intravenous fluids or electrolytes as appropriate. 
Upon recovery to Grade ≤ 1, resume dacomitinib with a reduction of 
1 dose level.
•  For Grade 1 rash or erythematous skin conditions, no dose 
modification is required. Initiate treatment (e.g., antibiotics, topical 
steroids, and emollients). 
•  For Grade 1 exfoliative skin conditions, no dose modification is 
required. Initiate treatment (e.g., oral antibiotics and topical steroids). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  For Grade 2 rash, erythematous or exfoliative skin conditions, no dose 
modification is required. Initiate treatment or provide additional 
treatment (e.g., oral antibiotics and topical steroids). 
If Grade 2 rash, erythematous or exfoliative skin conditions persist for 
72 hours despite treatment, withhold dacomitinib. Upon recovery to 
Grade ≤ 1, resume dacomitinib at the same dose level or consider a 
reduction of 1 dose level. 
• 
•  For Grade ≥ 3 rash, erythematous or exfoliative skin conditions, 
withhold dacomitinib. Initiate or continue treatment and/or provide 
additional treatment (e.g., broad spectrum oral or intravenous 
antibiotics and topical steroids). Upon recovery to Grade ≤ 1, resume 
dacomitinib with a reduction of 1 dose level. 
•  For Grade 1 or 2 toxicity, no dose modification is required. 
•  For Grade ≥ 3 toxicity, withhold dacomitinib until symptoms resolve 
to Grade ≤ 2. Upon recovery, resume dacomitinib with a reduction of 
1 dose level. 
Other 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
No starting dose adjustments are required when administering Vizimpro to patients with mild 
(Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. The starting dose of 
Vizimpro should be adjusted to 30 mg once daily in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic 
impairment. The dose may be increased to 45 mg once daily based on individual safety and tolerability 
after at least 4 weeks of treatment (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No starting dose adjustments are required when administering Vizimpro to patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 30 mL/min). Limited data are available in 
patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). No data are available in patients requiring 
haemodialysis. Thus no dosing recommendations can be made for either patient population (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly population 
No starting dose adjustment of Vizimpro in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) patients is required (see section 
5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Vizimpro in the paediatric population (< 18 years of age) have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Vizimpro is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed with water and can be taken with or without 
meals. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Assessment of EGFR mutation status 
When assessing the EGFR mutation status of a patient, it is important that a well-validated and robust 
methodology is chosen to avoid false negative or false positive determinations. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis 
ILD/pneumonitis, which could be fatal, has been reported in patients receiving Vizimpro (see 
section 4.8). Patients with a history of ILD have not been studied. 
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary 
symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD/pneumonitis. Treatment 
with dacomitinib should be withheld pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD/pneumonitis is 
confirmed, dacomitinib should be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as 
necessary (see section 4.2). 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been very commonly reported during treatment with 
Vizimpro (see section 4.8). Diarrhoea may result in dehydration with or without renal impairment, 
which could be fatal if not adequately treated. 
Proactive management of diarrhoea should start at the first sign of diarrhoea especially within the first 
2 weeks of starting dacomitinib, including adequate hydration combined with anti-diarrhoeal 
medicinal products and continued until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours. Anti-diarrhoeal 
medicinal products (e.g., loperamide) should be used and, if necessary, escalated to the highest 
recommended approved dose. Patients may require dosing interruption and/or dose reduction of 
therapy with dacomitinib. Patients should maintain adequate oral hydration and patients who become 
dehydrated may require administration of intravenous fluids and electrolytes (see section 4.2). 
Skin-related adverse reactions 
Rash, erythematous and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported in patients treated with 
Vizimpro (see section 4.8). 
For prevention of dry skin, initiate treatment with moisturizers, and upon development of rash, initiate 
treatment with topical antibiotics, emollients, and topical steroids. Start oral antibiotics and topical 
steroids in patients who develop exfoliative skin conditions. Consider adding broad spectrum oral or 
intravenous antibiotics if any of these conditions worsen to greater than or equal to Grade 2 severity. 
Rash, erythematous and exfoliative skin conditions may occur or worsen in areas exposed to the sun. 
Advise patients to use protective clothing and sunscreen before exposure to the sun. Patients may 
require dosing interruption and/or dose reduction of therapy with dacomitinib (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity and transaminases increased 
Transaminases increased (alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
transaminases increased) have been reported during treatment with Vizimpro (see section 4.8). Among 
NSCLC patients treated with dacomitinib 45 mg daily, there have been isolated reports of 
hepatotoxicity in 4 (1.6%) patients. Across the dacomitinib program, hepatic failure led to a fatal 
outcome in 1 patient. Therefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. In patients who 
develop severe elevations in transaminases while taking dacomitinib, treatment should be interrupted 
(see section 4.2).

Medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 
Vizimpro may increase exposure (or decrease exposure of active metabolites) of other medicinal 
products metabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of medicinal products predominantly metabolised 
by CYP2D6 should be avoided unless such products are considered necessary (see section 4.5). 
Other forms of interactions 
Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with dacomitinib should be avoided (see 
section 4.5). 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains < 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Co-administration of dacomitinib with agents that increase gastric pH 
The aqueous solubility of dacomitinib is pH dependent, with low (acidic) pH resulting in higher 
solubility. Data from a study in 24 healthy subjects indicated that co-administration of a single 45 mg 
dacomitinib dose with the PPI rabeprazole 40 mg once daily for 7 days decreased dacomitinib Cmax, 
AUC0-96h (area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 96 hours), and AUCinf (AUC from 
time 0 to infinity) (n=14) by approximately 51%, 39%, and 29%, respectively, when compared to a 
single 45 mg dose of dacomitinib administered alone. PPIs should be avoided while receiving 
treatment with dacomitinib (see section 4.4). 
Based on data from observations in 8 patients from Study A7471001, there was no apparent effect of 
local antacid administration on Cmax and AUCinf of dacomitinib. Based on pooled data in patients, there 
was no apparent effect of histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists on steady-state trough concentration 
of dacomitinib (geometric mean ratio of 86% (90% CI: 73; 101). Local antacids and H2 receptor 
antagonists may be used if needed. Dacomitinib should be administered 2 hours before or at least 
10 hours after taking H2 receptor antagonists. 
Co-administration of dacomitinib and CYP2D6 substrates 
Co-administration of single 45 mg oral dose of dacomitinib increased the mean exposure (AUClast and 
Cmax) of dextromethorphan, a probe CYP2D6 substrate, 855% and 874%, respectively, compared with 
administration of dextromethorphan alone. These results suggest that dacomitinib may increase 
exposure of other medicinal products (or decrease exposure to active metabolites) primarily 
metabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of medicinal products predominantly metabolised by 
CYP2D6 should be avoided (see section 4.4). If concomitant use of such medicinal products is 
considered necessary, they should follow their respective labels for dose recommendation regarding 
co-administration with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors. 
Effect of dacomitinib on drug transporters 
Based on in vitro data, dacomitinib may have the potential to inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) (in the gastrointestinal [GI] tract), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) (systemically and 
GI tract), and organic cation transporter (OCT)1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 5.2).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Woman of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
Vizimpro. Women of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product should use 
adequate contraceptive methods during therapy and for at least 17 days (5 half-lives) after completing 
therapy. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of dacomitinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
limited effects on reproductive toxicity (lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption in 
rats and rabbits, and lower foetal body weight and higher incidence of unossified metatarsals in rats 
only) (see section 5.3). Based on its mechanism of action, dacomitinib may cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Dacomitinib should not be used during pregnancy. Female patients 
taking dacomitinib during pregnancy or who become pregnant while taking dacomitinib should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether dacomitinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many 
medicinal products are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in breast-fed infants from exposure to dacomitinib, mothers should be advised against 
breast-feeding while receiving this medicinal product. 
Fertility 
Fertility studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. Non-clinical safety studies showed 
reversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and vagina of rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vizimpro has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue 
or ocular adverse reactions while taking dacomitinib should exercise caution when driving or 
operating machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The adverse reactions observed at doses greater than 45 mg once daily were primarily gastrointestinal, 
dermatological, and constitutional (e.g., fatigue, malaise, and weight loss). 
There is no known antidote for dacomitinib. The treatment of dacomitinib overdose should consist of

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-neoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EB07 
Mechanism of action 
Dacomitinib is a pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) (EGFR/HER1, HER2, and 
HER4) inhibitor, with activity against mutated EGFR with deletions in exon 19 or the L858R 
substitution in exon 21. Dacomitinib binds selectively and irreversibly to its HER family targets 
thereby providing prolonged inhibition. 
Clinical efficacy 
Vizimpro in first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations (ARCHER 1050) 
The efficacy and safety of Vizimpro was studied in a Phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050) conducted in 
patients with locally advanced, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, or metastatic 
NSCLC harbouring activating mutations of EGFR, to demonstrate the superiority of dacomitinib 
versus gefitinib. A total of 452 patients were randomised 1:1 to dacomitinib or gefitinib in a 
multicentre, multinational, randomised, open-label Phase 3 study. 
Treatment was administered orally on a continuous daily basis until disease progression, institution of 
new anticancer therapy, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or investigator decision 
dictated by protocol compliance, whichever occurred first. Stratification factors at randomisation were 
race (Japanese versus mainland Chinese versus other East Asian versus non-East Asian, as stated by 
the patient), and EGFR mutation status (exon 19 deletion versus the L858R mutation in exon 21). 
EGFR mutation status was determined by a standardised and commercially available test kit. 
The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by blinded 
Independent Radiology Central (IRC) review. Key secondary endpoints included objective response 
rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS). 
The demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 60% female; median age at 
enrolment was 62 years with 10.8% being ≥ 75 years old. Thirty percent had baseline Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 and 70% had ECOG PS 1; 59% had 
an exon 19 deletion, and 41% had a L858R mutation in exon 21. Race was 23% White, 77% Asian, 
and < 1% Black. Patients with brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease or ECOG PS ≥ 2 were 
excluded from the study. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A statistically significant improvement in PFS as determined by the IRC was demonstrated for patients 
randomised to dacomitinib compared with those randomised to gefitinib, see Table 5 and Figure 1. 
Subgroup analyses of PFS per IRC review based on baseline characteristics were consistent with those 
from the primary analysis of PFS. In particular, the hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS per IRC review in 
Asian and non-Asian patients were 0.509 (95% CI: 0.391, 0. 662) and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.568, 1.391), 
respectively. In Asian patients, median PFS was 16.5 months for dacomitinib arm and 9.3 months for 
gefitinib arm. In non-Asian patients, median PFS was 9.3 months for dacomitinib arm and 9.2 months 
for gefitinib arm. 
OS results from the final analysis (data cut-off date of 17-Feb-2017) when 48.7% of events had 
occurred showed a HR of 0.760 (95% CI: 0.582, 0.993) and a gain of 7.3 months in median OS 
(median OS: 34.1 months [95% CI: 29.5, 37.7] and 26.8 months [95% CI: 23.7, 32.1] in the 
dacomitinib and gefitinib arm, respectively). However, according to the hierarchical testing approach, 
the analysis was stopped with the testing of ORR as the statistical significance was not reached. 
Therefore, the statistical significance of OS improvement could not be formally assessed.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
dacomitinib in all subsets of the paediatric population in NSCLC indication (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption  
Following the administration of a single 45 mg dose of dacomitinib tablets, the mean oral 
bioavailability of dacomitinib is 80% (range: 65% to 100%) compared to intravenous administration, 
with Cmax occurring 5 to 6 hours after oral dosing. Following dacomitinib 45 mg daily dosing, 
steady-state was reached within 14 days. Food does not alter bioavailability to a clinically meaningful 
extent. Dacomitinib is a substrate for the membrane transport proteins P-gp and BCRP. However, 
based on the oral bioavailability of 80%, these membrane transport proteins are unlikely to have any 
impact on dacomitinib absorption. 
Distribution  
Dacomitinib is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady-state volume of 
distribution of 27 L/kg (patient of 70 kg) [coefficient of variation (CV%): 18%] following intravenous 
administration. In plasma, dacomitinib binds to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein and the fraction 
unbound is approximately 2% in vitro and ex vivo in healthy volunteers. 
Biotransformation  
In humans, dacomitinib undergoes oxidation and glutathione conjugation as the major metabolic 
pathways. Following oral administration of a single 45-mg dose of [14C] dacomitinib, the most 
abundant circulating metabolite was O-desmethyl dacomitinib. This metabolite exhibited in vitro 
pharmacologic activity that was similar to that of dacomitinib in the in vitro biochemical assays. In 
faeces, dacomitinib, O-desmethyl dacomitinib, a cysteine conjugate of dacomitinib, and a 
mono-oxygenated metabolite of dacomitinib were the major drug-related components. In vitro studies 
indicated that CYP2D6 was the major CYP isozyme involved in the formation of O-desmethyl 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dacomitinib, while CYP3A4 contributed to the formation of other minor oxidative metabolites. 
O-desmethyl dacomitinib accounted for 16% of human plasma radioactivity and is formed mainly by 
CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9. The inhibition of CYP2D6 translated into approximately a 
90% reduction in metabolite exposure and an approximate 37% increase in dacomitinib exposure. 
Other information on drug-drug interactions 
Effect of dacomitinib and O-desmethyl dacomitinib on CYP enzymes 
In vitro, dacomitinib and its metabolite O-desmethyl dacomitinib have a low potential to inhibit the 
activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. In vitro, dacomitinib has a low potential to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at 
clinically relevant concentrations. 
Effect of dacomitinib on drug transporters 
In vitro, dacomitinib has a low potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters P-gp 
(systemically), organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3, OCT2, organic anion transporting 
polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and OATP1B3, but may inhibit the activity of P-gp (in the GI tract), BCRP 
(systemically and GI tract), and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Effect of dacomitinib on UGT Enzymes 
In vitro, dacomitinib has a low potential to inhibit uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT)1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15. 
Elimination 
The plasma half-life of dacomitinib ranges from 54 to 80 hours. Dacomitinib showed a clearance of 
20.0 L/hr with an inter-individual variability of 32% (CV%). In 6 healthy male subjects given a 
single-oral dose of [14C] radiolabeled dacomitinib, a median of 82% of the total administered 
radioactivity was recovered in 552 hours; faeces (79% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 
3% of the dose recovered in urine, of which < 1% of the administered dose was unchanged 
dacomitinib. 
Special populations 
Age, race, gender, body weight 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, patient age, race (Asian and non-Asian), gender, and 
body weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on predicted steady-state exposure of dacomitinib. 
Approximately 90% of patients included in this analysis were Asian or White. 
Hepatic impairment 
In a dedicated hepatic impairment study, following a single-oral dose of 30 mg Vizimpro, dacomitinib 
exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) was unchanged in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A; N=8) and 
decreased by 15% and 20%, respectively in moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B; N=9) 
when compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=8). In a second dedicated hepatic 
impairment study, following a single-oral dose of 30 mg Vizimpro, dacomitinib exposure was 
unchanged for AUCinf and increased by 31% for Cmax in subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C; N=8), when compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=8). In 
addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from 1381 patients, that included 
158 patients with mild hepatic impairment defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria [total 
bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total 
bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST; N=158], mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib. From the small number of patients in the moderate group [total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST; N=5], there is no evidence for a change in dacomitinib 
pharmacokinetics. 
Renal impairment 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with impaired renal function. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analyses, mild (60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min; N=590) and moderate 
(30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min; N=218) renal impairment, did not alter dacomitinib 
pharmacokinetics, relative to subjects with normal (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min; N=567) renal function. 
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min) (N=4). The pharmacokinetics in patients requiring haemodialysis have not been 
studied. 
Exposure response relationships 
No clear relationship between dacomitinib exposure and efficacy could be characterised over the 
exposure range studied. Significant exposure-safety relationship was defined for Grade ≥ 3 
rash/dermatitis acneiform, other skin toxicities, diarrhoea and Grade ≥ 1 stomatitis. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated-dose toxicity 
In oral repeated-dose toxicity studies for up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs, the primary 
toxicities were identified in the skin/hair (dermal changes in rats and dogs, atrophy/dysplasia of hair 
follicles in rats), kidney (papillary necrosis often accompanied by tubular degeneration, regeneration, 
dilatation and/or atrophy and changes in urinary markers indicative of renal injury in rats, erosion or 
ulceration of the pelvic epithelium with associated inflammation without changes indicative of renal 
dysfunction in dogs), eye (cornea epithelial atrophy in rats and dogs, corneal ulcers/erosions with 
red/swollen conjunctiva(e), conjunctivitis, elevated third eyelid, increased squinting, partially closed 
eyes, lacrimation, and/or ocular discharge in dogs), and digestive system (enteropathy in rats and dogs, 
erosions/ulcers of the mouth with reddened mucous membranes in dogs), and atrophy of epithelial 
cells of other organs in rats. In addition, hepatocellular necrosis with transaminase increases and 
hepatocellular vacuolation were observed in rats only. These effects were reversible with the exception 
of hair follicles and kidney changes. All effects occurred at systemic exposure below that in humans at 
the recommended dose of 45 mg once daily. 
Genotoxicity 
Dacomitinib was tested using a series of genetic toxicology assays. Dacomitinib was not mutagenic in 
a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, and not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo bone 
marrow micronucleus assay in male and female rats. Dacomitinib was clastogenic in the in vitro 
human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay at cytotoxic concentrations. Dacomitinib is not 
directly reactive toward DNA as evidenced by the negative response in the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay and did not induce chromosome damage in a bone marrow micronucleus assay at concentrations 
up to approximately 60-70 times the unbound AUC or Cmax at the recommended human dose. Thus, 
dacomitinib is not expected to be genotoxic at clinically relevant exposure concentrations. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. 
Impairment of fertility 
Fertility studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
dacomitinib, effects on reproductive organs were observed in female rats given approximately 
0.3 times the unbound AUC at the recommended human dose (for 6 months) and were limited to 
reversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and vagina. There was no effect on reproductive organs in 
male rats given ≤ 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months (approximately 1.1 times the unbound AUC at the 
recommended human dose), or in dogs given ≤ 1 mg/kg/day for 9 months (approximately 0.3 times the 
unbound AUC at the recommended human dose). 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Developmental toxicity 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses up to 
approximately 2.4 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the unbound AUC at the recommended human 
dose during the period of organogenesis. Maternal body weight gain and food intake were lower in 
pregnant rats and rabbits. The maternally toxic dose was foetotoxic in rats, resulting in reduced foetal 
body weights and higher incidence of unossified metatarsals. 
Phototoxicity 
A phototoxicity study with dacomitinib in pigmented rats showed no phototoxicity potential. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that dacomitinib has the potential to be very 
persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (see section 6.6).

1.  What Vizimpro is and what it is used for 
Vizimpro contains the active substance dacomitinib, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are used to treat cancer. 
Vizimpro is used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called ‘non-small cell lung cancer’. If a test 
has shown that your cancer has certain changes (mutations) in a gene called ‘EGFR’ (epidermal 
growth factor receptor) and has spread to your other lung or other organs, your cancer is likely to 
respond to treatment with Vizimpro. 
Vizimpro can be used as your first treatment once your lung cancer has spread to your other lung or 
other organs. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Vizimpro 
Do not take Vizimpro 
• 
if you are allergic to dacomitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vizimpro: 
• 
• 
if you ever had any other lung problems. Some lung problems may get worse during treatment 
with Vizimpro, as Vizimpro may cause inflammation of the lungs during treatment. 
Symptoms may be similar to those from lung cancer. Tell your doctor right away if you have 
any new or worsening symptoms including difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, or 
cough with or without phlegm (mucous), or fever.

medicine.

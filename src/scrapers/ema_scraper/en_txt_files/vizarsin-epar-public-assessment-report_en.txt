SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
The  product  is  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  sildenafil  as  sildenafil  citrate  as  active 
substance. 
The reference medicinal product is Viagra 25, 50 and 100 mg film-coated tablets. 
Sildenafil is an inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific phosphodiesterase 
(PDE5). During natural erection, nitric oxide (NO) is released and this triggers the synthesis of cGMP 
which, in turn, relaxes the corpora cavernosa (a key point in the erection process). PDE5 present in 
the corpus cavernosum breaks down cGMP, sildenafil prevents the breakdown of cGMP and, thus 
enhances the induced erectile response. 
The safety and efficacy profile of sildenafil has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of 
which  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Viagra.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing 
experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a 
generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Viagra, summary of the clinical data 
of  sildenafil  citrate 
is  available  and  no  new  clinical  studies  regarding  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted with sildenafil citrate.  
The indication proposed for Vizarsin is the same as the reference medicinal product.   
2.2 
Quality aspects 
Introduction 
The product is presented as film coated tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 mg of sildenafil citrate as 
active substance. 
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous calcium hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose 
sodium, hypromellose (E464), magnesium stearate 
Film coating: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin 
The film coated tablets are packed in blisters of PVC/ Al foil blisters. 
Active Substance  
Sildenafil is a white to off-white, crystalline powder that is slightly soluble in water. It is also 
insoluble in ethanol, chloroform, acetone,but soluble in dimethyl formamide, DMSO and in methanol. 
Sildenafil has the chemical name 5-[2-ethoxy-5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)sulfonylphenyl]-1-methyl-3-
propyl-4H-pyrazolo[5,4-e]pyrimidin-7-one; 2-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid. It does not 
show polymorphism or enantiomerism.  
• 
Manufacture 
The  manufacturing  of  sildenafil  consists  of  synthesis  and  crystallization. Sildenafil is manufactured 
by  two  manufacturing  sites.  The  complete  scientific  documentation  from  the  first  manufacturer  is 
included in the dossier. Two alternative routes are described leading to the same impurity profile. The 
information on the manufacturing site from the second active substance manufacturer is provided in 
an ASMF.  
Adequate  In-Process  Controls  are  applied  during  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance.  The 
specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents,  have 
been presented and are satisfactory.

• 
Specification 
The  specifications  of  the  drug  substance  include  identification  of  sildenafil citrate, identification of 
citrates,  water  content,  heavy  metals,  sulphated  ash,  related  substances  determination,  assay  of 
sildenafil citrate and of citric acid, and residual solvent. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch.  
• 
Stability 
Three production scale batches of the active substance from the first manufacturer  were put on long-
term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  12  months,  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months  stability 
testing  ICH  conditions.  Photostability  test  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  two 
batches. The following parameters were tested: appearance, water, content and related substances of 
sildenafil and content of citric acid.  The stability results justify the proposed retest period. 
Four production scale batches of the active substance from the second manufacturer were put on long-
term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  60  months,  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months  stability 
testing  ICH  conditions.  Photostability  test  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  two 
batches. The following parameters were tested: appearance, water, content and related substances of 
sildenafil and content of citric acid.  The stability results justify the proposed retest period. 
Medicinal Product 
• 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Vizarsin  has  been  developed  with  the  objective  of  developing  a  stable  formulation  and  to  match 
dissolution  profile  of  the  reference  product,  and  being  essentially  similar  product  to  the  reference 
medicinal product Viagra. 
A  direct  compression  process  was  firstly  tested.  This  approach  was  not  successful  due  to  the  static 
nature of the drug. A wet granulation has then been chosen. 
A  lot  of  trials  have  been  conducted  in  order  to  obtain  suitable  compression  characteristics,  flow 
properties  of  compression  mixture,  optimal  physical  characteristics  of  cores  and  amount  of  coating 
layer, but also dissolution and stability properties. 
A number of studies were also carried out to define the compatibility of the active substance with the 
pharmaceutical  excipients  used.  A  wet  granulation  has  been  selected  as  manufacturing  process 
especially in view of the static nature of the active substance.  
The excipients used in the formulation are tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous calcium 
hydrogen phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose (E464), magnesium stearate 
film coating: lactose monohydrate, hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin 
All excipients used are in compliance with the Ph Eur. with the exception of the colouring agent.  
The lactose anhydrous is derived from milk, it is declared that it satisfy the requirements outlined in 
the TSE Guideline. 
Blister  PVC  with  aluminium  foil  have  been  selected  in  order  to  provide  a  good  protection  of  the 
tablets.

• 
Manufacture of the Product 
The finished product is manufactured by two manufacturers. The manufacturing process includes 
blending, granulation, tabletting, drying, and film-coating. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing process.  
The  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the 
agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation. 
• 
Product Specification 
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, water content (Ph Eur), 
hardness  (Ph  Eur),  disintegration  (Ph  Eur),  identification  of  sildenafil  (HPLC),  identification  of 
citrate,  identification  of  titanium  dioxide,    related  substances  (HPLC),  dissolution  of  sildenafil  (Ph 
Eur), assay ( HPLC),  microbiological quality (Ph Eur)   
Batch  analysis  results  confirm  consistency  and  uniformity  of  manufacture  and  indicate  that  the 
process is under control. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies 
• 
Stability of the Product 
Three  production  scale  batches  of  the  finished  product  (25  mg  and  100  mg)  from  the  two 
manufacturers    were  put  on  long-term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  12  months,  and  accelerated 
(40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months  stability  testing  ICH  conditions.  Photostability  test  following  ICH 
guidelines  Q1B  was  also  performed.  The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  water 
content, hardness, disintegration, assay, related substances, dissolution, and microbial quality. 
The results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the 
time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to 
resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
2.3  Non-Clinical aspects   
This application is made in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by 
Directive 2004/27/EC. The applicant is not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests. Non-
clinical  testing  strategy  did  not  therefore  include  any  toxicological  or  pharmacological  studies 
performed by the applicant.  
The  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  is  based  on 
literature  searches  and  adequate  scientific  literature  has  been  provided.  The  overview  justifies  why 
there  is  no  need  to generate new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. 
There is thus no need for conducting tests on animals. 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. The introduction of sildenafil film-coated tablets 
manufactured by Krka is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes 
for  all  sildenafil  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to  the  active  substance. 
Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

2.4  Clinical Aspects  
Introduction 
This application concerns a marketing authorization under the centralised procedure. The subject of 
this application is sildenafil citrate film-coated tablets manufactured by Krka, in three strengths 25mg, 
50mg, 100mg.   
This  application  is  made  in  accordance  with  Art  3(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  “A  generic 
medicinal  product  of  a  reference  medicinal  product  authorised  by  the  Community”  and  Art  10(1) 
“generic  application”  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Viagra  25mg, 
50mg, 100mg film-coated tablets from Pfizer Pharma (EU/1/98/077/002-004; EU/1/98/077/006-008; 
EU/1/98/077/010-019).  
Scientific advice was not sought for the development programme. For the clinical assessment the Note 
for Guidance on Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in 
its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence 
Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of particular relevance. 
The applicant submitted a bioequivalence (BE) study with the highest strength of 100mg film-coated 
tablets and a biowaiver for the lower 50 and 25mg strengths was accepted in line with the Note for 
Guidance (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  
The SmPC is in line with that of the reference product Viagra. 
GCP aspects 
The  bioequivalence  study  provided  in  support  of  the  application  was  performed  by  a  Clinical 
Research Organisation (CRO) in Canada. The clinical part of the study was conducted in compliance 
with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as claimed by the sponsor. 
In accordance to Art 8(3)(ib) of the amended Directive, and Art 6.1 of the Regulation EC/726/2004, 
the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials that were conducted outside the 
EU were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 1 bioequivalence study with the highest 
strength of 100mg. This bioequivalence study was performed with healthy male volunteers under 
fasting conditions.  
Since this is a generic application no further clinical trials were required and the applicant performed 
none. Concerning clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy and clinical safety, the applicant performed 
an adequate review of relevant literature.

Pharmacokinetics  
•  Methods 
STUDY DESIGN: 
The study was designed according to a randomised, single-dose, laboratory-blinded, two-period, two-
sequence crossover classical scheme. 
In each period, subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 24-hour post-
dose events. Subjects were instructed to avoid alcohol, and food or beverages containing xanthine for 
58 hours prior to dosing and during each study protocol. Subjects were also instructed to avoid food 
or beverages containing grapefruit for 7 days prior to dosing and during each study protocol. 
In each period, subjects received a single oral 100mg dose of sildenafil with 240ml of water on the 
morning of Day 1. The bioequivalence study was performed under fasting conditions (after a 
supervised overnight fast), since the concomitant food intake reduces the rate of absorption of 
sildenafil with Tmax being delayed by approximately 60 minutes and Cmax reduced by 29% according 
to the SmPC of the reference product. Subjects were allowed to leave the clinical site after 24-hour 
blood draw.  
A 7 day wash-out was used in the study. The terminal half-life of sildenafil is 3 to 5 hours, hence the 
washout period length is acceptable. 
A total of 18 blood samples were collected in each period at pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.42, 0.58, 0.75, 
0.92,  1.08,  1.33,  1.67,  2,  2.5,  3,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  16,  and  24  hours  post-dose.  Blood  samples  were 
processed at 4°C afterwards and plasma samples were collected and stored at (-) 20°C and shipped for 
analysis. 
The clinical part of the study was conducted in Canada between 1st April 2008 and 11th April 2008. 
The bioanalytical facilities were in Canada and the statistical analysis was performed in Canada. 
The  protocol  and  the  informed  consent  form  were  approved  by  an  institutional  review  board  on 
2008/02/14 and the revision 01 of the informed consent forms was approved on 2008/03/11. The final 
study report was signed in July 2008. 
TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS: 
Test and reference product used in the study were as follows: 
Test product:  
Sildenafil  100mg  Film-Coated  tablets  manufactured  by  Krka,  d.d.  Novo  Mesto,  Slovenia;  batch  n° 
H8718, expiry date 05/2008. 
REFERENCE PRODUCT:

POPULATION(S) STUDIED   
34 male non-smoking healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. The main age was 35 (20-45), BMI 
ranged from 18.5 to below 29 kg/m2. All subjects were White. Subjects were in good health as 
determined by medical history, physical examination, ECG, laboratory tests (haematology, 
biochemistry, urinalysis). Subjects were instructed not to take any OTC medication for the 7 days 
prior to dosing, any prescription medication for 14 days prior to dosing, enzyme modifying drugs for 
28 days prior to Day 1 and nitrates for 30 days prior to dosing and during the study. All the subjects

met inclusion criteria including negative HIV, Hepatitis B and C tests as well as negative screening of 
ethyl alcohol cotinine test and drug of abuse in urine.  
Of the total of 34 volunteers included in the study 32 received the two treatments and were included 
in the statistical analysis. Of the 2 drop-outs one subject withdrew his consent for personal reasons 
and second one was withdrawn due to positive drug test (cannabinoids). 
ANALYTICAL METHODS: 
The  analytical  part  of  the  study  was  conducted  at  Bioanalytical  Facility  of Algorithme Pharma Inc. 
(Laval,  Quebec,  Canada).  The  analysis  of  plasma  samples  of  sildenafil  and  N-desmethyl-sildenafil 
was performed using the HPLC equipment with MS-MS tandem detection. 
A  detailed  description  of  the  operative  procedures  was  provided.  The  validation  of  the  method  and 
extended stability evaluation was performed and a detailed description of the validation process was 
provided.  
The main characteristics of the analytical methods are summarised below:

In  conclusion,  the  analytical  method  allowed  a  suitable  investigation  of  the  bioavailability  of 
sildenafil after oral administration. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES 
Relevant  PK  parameters  of  sildenafil  and  its  N-desmethyl  metabolite  were  estimated  using  a  non 
compartmental analysis (NCA). 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax  and  Tmax  were  either  observed  or 
calculated. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Cmax and Tmax were directly estimated 
from the individual concentrations versus time profiles. Additional PK parameters assessed included 
Kel, T1/2el and intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV). 
STATISTICAL METHODS   
The  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  performed  at  the  Department  of  biometry  and  statistics  of 
Algorithme  Pharma  Inc.  Laval,  Quebec,  Canada.  Parametric  ANOVA  on  ln-transformed  AUC0-t, 
AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  was  carried  out  for  both  analytes:  Sildenafil  and  its  N-desmethyl  metabolite.  The 
statistical model included sequence, period and treatment factors as fixed effects and subject within 
sequence  as  random  effect.  According  to  the  protocol the bioequivalence could be concluded if the 
least  square  means  ratio  with  corresponding  90%  CI  between  the  test  and  reference  product  for  ln-
transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax lied within 80-125% range. A non parametric test (Wilcoxon’s 
rank sum test) was carried out to compare Tmax.

Conclusions 
• 
In conclusion, the conventional CI for ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax for sildenafil and N-
desmethyl sildenafil were within the acceptance range. No significant difference in Tmax was 
evidenced by the non-parametric test. Therefore, this study was considered to have met the 
11/14

bioequivalence criteria as defined by the study protocol since all 90% confidence intervals were 
within the acceptance range for both, sildenafil and its major metabolite. 
Protocol deviations (blood sampling time deviation and concomitant medication) were judged to have 
no significant influence on bioequivalence assessment.  
Transferability of study results to other strengths 
The  applicant  submitted  a  Bioequivalence  study  with  the  highest  strength  (100mg  tablets)  and 
requested biowaiver for the lower 50 and 25mg strengths. This request was found acceptable since all 
criteria  for  a  biowaiver  listed  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) were fulfilled, namely:  
1. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process; 
2. The drug input has been shown to be linear over the therapeutic dose range; 
3. The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
4. The ratio between amounts of the active substance and excipients is the same; 
5.  The  dissolution  profiles  are  similar  under  identical  conditions  for  the additional strength and the 
strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
In conclusion, the extrapolation of the results obtained for the 100mg sildenafil film-coated tablets to 
the 50mg and 25mg film-coated tablets was deemed acceptable. 
CLINICAL SAFETY 
Twenty seven subjects participating in the trials reported adverse events. The maximal intensity 
reported for these events ranged from mild to severe. None of the events were considered serious. 
Four adverse events (2 cases of headache, testicular pain and testicular swelling) required the use of 
concomitant medication. No subject was withdrawn from the study because of an event. 
In conclusion, both formulations were well tolerated with no major adverse events and no relevant 
differences in safety profile were observed between the preparations.  
Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application.  
Discussion on Clinical aspects 
To support the application, 1 bioequivalence study with the highest strength of sildenafil, i.e. 100mg 
was  submitted.  The  study  was  designed  according to a randomised, single-dose, laboratory-blinded, 
two-period, two-sequence crossover classical scheme. 
32 subjects of the 34 enrolled received the two treatments and were included in the statistical analysis. 
The  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  under  appropriate  conditions  and  in  line  with  applicable 
guidelines. 
The  results  of  the  bioequivalence  study  showed  that  the  conventional  confidence  intervals  for  ln-
transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax for sildenafil and N-desmethyl sildenafil were within the 
acceptance  range  of  80-125%.  No  significant  difference  in  Tmax  was  evidenced  by  the  non-
parametric  test.  Therefore,  based  on  the  available  data  it  was  concluded  that  bioequivalence  of  the 
two products had been demonstrated. 
The  extrapolation  of  the  bioequivalence  study  results  obtained  for  the  100mg  sildenafil  film-coated 
tablets  to  the  50mg  and  25mg  film-coated  tablets  was  deemed  acceptable  since  all  criteria  for  a 
biowaiver listed in the applicable guidance were fulfilled.

The  adverse  events  observed  in  the  study  were  graded  mild  to  severe  and  were  comparable  to  the 
originator.  None  of  the  events  were  considered  serious.  Four  adverse  events  (2  cases  of  headache, 
testicular  pain  and  testicular  swelling)  required  the  use  of  concomitant  medication.  No  subject  was 
withdrawn from the study because of an event. 
The safety concerns with the use of sildenafil have been addressed in the SmPC with the inclusion of 
appropriate warnings, precautions, and contraindications, and are in line with the reference product.

2.6  Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
This application is made in accordance with Art 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 “A generic 
medicinal product of a reference medicinal product authorised by the Community” and Art 10(1) 
“generic application” of Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product is Viagra 25mg, 
50mg, 100mg film-coated tablets. According to the legal basis no non-clinical studies were required. 
The applicant provided an appropriate non-clinical overview of sildenafil based on scientific 
literature. Moreover, no additional clinical trials were required except for bioequivalence studies. The 
clinical overview provided an adequate summary of clinical data for sildenafil. The results of the 
bioequivalence study demonstrated the bioequivalence of 100mg film-coated tablet of Krka sildenafil 
and the reference product, Viagra 100mg film-coated tablet. The extrapolation of the study results to 
lower strengths of sildenafil, i.e. 50mg and 25mg, was deemed acceptable. The adverse events in the 
bioequivalence study were comparable to the reference product and no serious adverse  
events were observed.

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has 
been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the originator can therefore be concluded.  
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of 
Vizarsin  25mg,  50mg  and  100mg  film-coated  tablets  in  the  treatment  of  erectile  dysfunction  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

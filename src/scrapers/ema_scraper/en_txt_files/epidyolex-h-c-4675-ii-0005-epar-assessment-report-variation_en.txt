Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterised by the formation of non-malignant 
tumours (tubers) in multiple organ systems. Tumours in TSC patients occur primarily in the brain, eyes, 
heart, kidney, skin, and lungs. Epileptic seizures are the most common neurological manifestation of TSC, 
affecting more than 70% of patients. 
In this procedure, the MAH is seeking approval to add the new indication for use as adjunctive therapy of 
seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for patients 1 year of age and older. 
Epidemiology 
The incidence rate is approximately 1:10000 to 1:5000 live births. Prevalence may be underestimated but 
in Europe is usually given as 1:25000 to 1:5000. TSC is a chronic, life-long condition. As patients 
transition into adulthood seizures may persist, and renal and pulmonary issues may become more 
important, and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 8/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene may cause tuberous sclerosis complex. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes 
code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These proteins normally act as tumour 
suppressors. The pathogenetic events leading to seizures are not completely understood. 
Clinical presentation 
Seizure onset occurs within the first year of life in approximately two-thirds of TSC patients. The onset of 
epilepsy in TSC commonly manifests as focal motor seizures, which in approximately one-third of TSC 
patients coexist with infantile spasms. Virtually all TSC patients with infantile spasms and approximately 
half of all epileptic TSC patients without them develop multiple seizure types, including complex focal 
seizures (with or without secondary generalization), generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atonic seizures, and 
atypical absences. Infantile spasms resolve with time, but the frequency and severity of other seizures 
tend to increase throughout early childhood and nearly two-thirds of TSC patients develop medically 
intractable epilepsy. Cognitive impairment (intelligence/developmental quotient < 70) is observed in 
around 60% of all TSC patients with a history of seizures. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is one of 
the most common causes of death. 
Management 
Most patients with TSC take between 3 and 5 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); however, such treatment 
regimens rarely provide sufficient seizure control and are often accompanied by intolerable side effects.  
The only approved therapy for TSC-associated seizures in the EU is the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. 
Everolimus was originally approved in the EU in 2011 (as Votubia) to treat tumours in patients aged 3 
years and older with TSC, and the indication was subsequently extended in 2017 to include adjunctive 
treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset 
seizures. The mTOR inhibitors are anti-tumour agents with immunosuppressive properties. In addition to 
TSC-associated seizures, everolimus is indicated for treatment of advanced or progressive malignancies 
(breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumours, and renal cell carcinoma), as well as non-cancerous tumours in 
patients with TSC. Adverse reactions to everolimus include non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, severe 
hypersensitivity reactions, angioedema, stomatitis, renal failure, impaired wound healing, metabolic 
disorders, and myelosuppression. 
Vigabatrin (VGB) was first licensed as an antiepileptic agent (in the UK and the Republic of Ireland) in 
1989 (as Sabril) and was most recently approved in the EU in 2018 (as Kigabeq) to treat infantile 
spasms, and is often used for treatment of infantile spasms secondary to TSC. Vigabatrin is typically 
recommended as a first-line treatment for TSC-related spasms or focal seizures in children < 1 year of 
age in Europe. 
Corticotropin (ACTH) or other corticosteroids have been demonstrated as effective in the treatment of 
infantile spasms. AEs include infections secondary to immunosuppression, hypertension, glucosuria, and 
metabolic abnormalities. ACTH may contribute to the enlargement of cardiac rhabdomyoma in TSC 
patients, and close monitoring is required in TSC patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma. Thus, corticosteroid 
therapy is generally short-term (approximately 2 weeks followed by taper), and close monitoring is 
required in TSC patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma. 
Utilisation of clobazam (CLB) is estimated to be limited to < 20% of the 46,000 patients with TSC in the 
EU. Benzodiazepines such as CLB are not commonly used for treating seizures associated with TSC, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 9/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
guidelines do not support utilisation. Data on effectiveness of CLB on focal seizures are limited, and there 
are no dosing recommendations to guide initiation, titration, and target dosing of CLB for the treatment of 
seizures associated with TSC in children aged < 6 years old. While CLB may be a useful add-on 
medication for some with refractory epilepsy, its clinical utility may be limited by its behavioural side 
effects (severe aggressive outbursts, hyperactivity, insomnia, and depression with suicidal ideation), 
which are important comorbidities in some patients with TSC. Additionally, CLB is associated with adverse 
reactions including somnolence, sedation, cognitive impairment, respiratory depression, tolerance, and 
dependence. 
There remains an unmet medical need for new efficacious pharmaceutical treatments for refractory 
seizures in TSC. Despite the currently available treatment options, many patients with TSC-associated 
epilepsy continue to have seizures: more than 60% of patients do not achieve seizure control despite the 
availability of multiple AEDs and non-pharmacological interventions. Current AEDs are often associated 
with side effects, which can be worsened by polypharmacy. As with any refractory epilepsy, physicians 
typically trial several AEDs in order to gain epilepsy control. However, such polypharmacy often leads to a 
high burden of adverse events (AEs), and thus the appropriate balance of tolerability and efficacy is 
critical to achieving seizure control. Accordingly, treatment selection is informed by safety and tolerability 
that may impact quality of life. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Epidyolex (cannabidiol) oral solution (CBD-OS) was approved in Europe in September 2019 for the 
treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Dravet Syndrome (DS), in 
conjunction with clobazam, in patients 2 years of age and older. Cannabidiol has negligible affinity for the 
cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, and the full mode of action is not completely understood.  
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GLP and GCP 
Non-clinical 
In the initial MAA, several non-clinical studies were not conducted according to GLP due to unreliable 
bioanalysis. Mitigation measures were undertaken or are ongoing (see Epidyolex EPAR). In this 
extension of indication procedure, the MAH provided several updated non-clinical study reports (see 
non-clinical aspects). 
Clinical 
According to the MAH, the clinical study GWEP1521 was conducted in compliance with the GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
For the TSC indication, the recommended starting dose of cannabidiol is 2.5 mg/kg taken twice daily (5 
mg/kg/day) for one week. After one week, the dose should be increased to a dose of 5 mg/kg twice daily 
(10 mg/kg/day). Based on individual clinical response and tolerability, the dose can be further increased 
in  weekly  increments  of  2.5  mg/kg  administered  twice  daily  (5  mg/kg/day)  up  to  a  maximum 
recommended dose of 12.5 mg/kg twice daily (25 mg/kg/day). 
Assessment report

In line with new proposed maximal daily dose of 25 mg/kg, the relevant non-clinical sections of SmPC 
have been updated.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Three new in vivo pharmacology studies (GWPP17072, GWPP18020 and GWCRI17024) and a PKPD 
summary report (GWPP18094) were submitted. 
Evaluation of Purified CBD or 7-OH-CBD in the 6 Hz psychomotor seizure test in the mouse 
(GWPP17072, GWPP18020) 
Male Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice (12/group) were given an i.p. injection of 0 (vehicle; 
10% ethanol and 20% Kolliphor HS 15 in physiological saline), 0 (neutral vehicle; 0.2% hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose in physiological saline), 2 mg/kg diazepam (positive control), 200 mg/kg Purified CBD, or 
150 or 200 mg/kg 7-OH-CBD. Seizures were induced by an electrical shock stimulus via corneal 
electrodes. The number of tonic convulsions and mortality rate were assessed. 
Eleven of the 12 mice in the neutral vehicle group displayed tonic convulsions and there were no 
differences in effects on seizures for the 2 vehicle substances. Both Purified CBD and 7-OH-CBD markedly 
decreased the number of mice showing tonic convulsions (-91% and -100% for both doses, respectively). 
Male Swiss mice (15/group) were administered (i.p.) physiological saline (neutral vehicle), vehicle (1:2:7 
of ethanol/Kolliphor HS15/physiological saline), 300 mg/kg valproate (positive control), 100 or 
300 mg/kg CBD, and 25, 50, 100, 200, 250 or 300 mg/kg 7-OH-CBD. Test substances and vehicle were 
administered 60 minutes before the test, while neutral vehicle and positive control were administered 
30 minutes before the test. Rectangular current (44 mA, 3 seconds duration, 6 Hz) via corneal electrodes 
produced seizures, which were quantified by measuring forelimb clonus. 
Reductions in the forelimb seizure score compared to vehicle control was seen in mice treated with 
valproate (300 mg/kg; -88%, p≤0.01), Purified CBD (100 and 300 mg/kg; -67%, p≤0.01; -89%, 
p≤0.001) and 7-OH-CBD (50, 100, 200, 250 and 300 mg/kg; -67%, ≤0.01; -80%, p≤0.01; -100%, 
p≤0.01; -80%, p≤0.05, -80%, p≤0.05 and -88%, p≤0.01), but no reductions were seen for 10 and 
30 mg/kg Purified CBD (no clear effects; -44%, non-significant [NS]) or 25 mg/kg 7-OH-CBD (-44%, 
NS). 
Data generated from GWPP17072 and GWPP18020 were used to calculate ED50 values (effective dose 
producing 50% maximum effect) for their antiseizure effects, using the log dose versus probits of effects 
linear regression (7-OH-CBD, 32.1 mg/kg; CBD, 49.6 mg/kg). The brain content of CBD and 7-OH-CBD 
were measured and EE50 values (effective exposure producing 50% maximum effect) were derived using 
the log brain exposure versus probits of effects of linear regression analysis and were 8.7 μM for 7-OH-
CBD and 47.3 μM for CBD (GWPP18094), see Table 1 and Figure 1.

A reduced intensity, status epilepticus (RISE) form of lithium pilocarpine induced epilepsy was used to 
model temporal lobe epilepsy. Male Wistar rats of PND 21-28 (two groups of 10/group) were 
administered 200 mg/kg/day Purified CBD or vehicle (3.5% Kolliphor HS15) p.o. via in drinking water for 
6 weeks, at which time before behavioural experiments assessment commenced and treatment continued 
(weeks 7 and 8 of drug treatment). An additional 10 healthy, age matched, nonepileptic control rats were 
treated with vehicle.

Compared to healthy vehicle treated rats, epileptic vehicle treated rats experienced seizures and 
displayed impaired performance on the accelerating rotarod (p<0.05), the static beam (p<0.05), working 
memory (p<0.0001) and reference memory (p<0.0001), with no effect on gait. Purified CBD reduced the 
seizure index (p<0.05) compared to the epileptic vehicle group. Purified CBD treated rats also spent more 
time on the accelerating rotarod (p<0.01) and displayed improved reference memory (p<0.01) and 
working memory (p<0.0001; assessed using the hole board test) compared to epileptic vehicle treated 
rats. Treatment with Purified CBD did not, however, alter performance on the static beam test or gait.

the Annex, however no claim of GLP compliance is made for this phase. The data confirms a level of 
exposure was achieved, however due to the issues related to this phase of the study the absolute 
exposure values cannot be confirmed or reported. 
In the new bioanalysis reports, a new appointed principal investigator concluded that bioanalytical data 
for 7-COOH and 7-OH-CBD was not quantitative/not reliable. Bioanalysis of CBD was deemed in the initial 
MAA procedure as overall reliable (although not GLP compliant) for all studies and is used for calculation 
of safety margins. 
Toxicokinetics for CBD: 
GWTX1412 Rat Week 26 
Mean maximum CBD plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 1400, 5240 and 6160 ng/mL in males, and 2070, 
3750 and 7530 ng/mL in females; and mean CBD AUC0-t values of 8700, 36700 and 60000 ng.h/mL in 
males, and 10800, 39000 and 67500 ng.h/mL in females, were observed at CBD dose levels of 15, 50 
and 150 mg/kg/day respectively. 
GWTX1413 Dog Week 39 
Mean maximum CBD plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 2150, 3860 and 2570 ng/mL in males, and 2770, 
5830 and 2660 ng/mL in females; and mean CBD AUC0-t values of 12500, 26900 and 20500 ng.h/mL in 
males, and 16500, 35900 and 22400 ng.h/mL in females, were observed at CBD dose levels of 10, 50 
and 100 mg/kg/day respectively. 
GWTX1503 Mouse Week 13 
Mean maximum CBD plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 3630, 3410 and 5770 ng/mL in females, and 5120, 
3700 and 9810 ng/mL in males; and mean CBD AUC0-t values of 22400, 29500 and 46400 ng.h/mL in 
females, and 21400, 37000 and 44300 ng.h/mL in males, were observed at CBD dose levels of 100, 150 
and 300 mg/kg/day respectively. 
Embryofetal toxicity in rat GWTX1454 
The main report was updated in order to change NOAEL for maternal toxicity from 250 mg/kg/day to 150 
mg/kg/day. Hence NOAEL for both maternal toxicity and embryo-lethality is now 150 mg/kg/day. In the 
main report, toxicokinetics was deemed unreliable in general. The bioanalytical report was updated with a 
statement of the Principal Investigator that bioanalytical data from 7-OH-CBD is not reliable. The analysis 
of 7-COOH-CBD, although not GLP-compliant, can be used. 
Toxicokinetics for CBD 
Following oral administration of CBD to rats, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) with means of 1980, 
3120 and 5420 ng/mL on Gestation Day 6 and 9000, 12800 and 13200 ng/mL on Gestation Day 17, and 
mean AUC0−t values of 25900, 44300 and 83900 h*ng/mL on Gestation Day 6 and 86300, 149000 and 
170000 h*ng/mL on Gestation Day 17, were observed at dose levels of 75, 150 and 250 mg/kg/day 
(Groups 2-4), respectively. 
Exposure to CBD (as measured by Cmax and AUC0−t) increased with increasing dose in a manner that 
appeared approximately dose proportional on Gestation Day 6, but less than dose-proportional after 
repeat dosing, with significant accumulation observed on Gestation Day 17 (ratios ranging from 2.03 to 
4.54).

Toxicokinetics for 7-COOH-CBD 
Following oral administration of CBD to rats, maximum 7-COOH-CBD plasma concentrations (Cmax) with 
means of 1170, 1990 and 4120 ng/mL on Gestation Day 6 and 5020, 6140 and 9550 ng/mL on Gestation 
Day 17, and mean AUC0−t values of 17100, 36300 and 84200 h*ng/mL on Gestation Day 6 and 41500, 
100000 and 155000 h*ng/mL on Gestation Day 17, were observed at dose levels of 75, 150 and 250 
mg/kg/day (Groups 2-4), respectively. 
Exposure to 7-COOH-CBD (as measured by Cmax and AUC0−t) increased with increasing dose in a manner 
that appeared approximately dose proportional, with the exception of Cmax on Gestation Day 17, where 
the increase in exposure was less than dose proportional. Significant accumulation was observed on 
Gestation Day 17, with ratios ranging from 1.84 to 4.28. 
Juvenile animal toxicity GWTX1408 supported with a new study with toxicokinetics 
GWTX18001 
The main report was updated in order to change the NOAEL from 15/250 mg/kg/day to 15/150 
mg/kg/day due to three inconclusive pup-deaths. Similarly to the other toxicity reports, in the main 
report, toxicokinetics was deemed unreliable in general. To make up for this, a new study of 
toxicokinetics was conducted (GWTX18001). NOAEL and exposure at NOAEL are marked in bold below. 
Toxicokinetics for CBD (GWTX18001) 
On PND 4, the mean Purified CBD exposure (AUC0-t) in plasma following a single 15 mg/kg subcutaneous 
dose of Purified CBD to juvenile rats was 14900 h.ng/mL. Following daily subcutaneous doses of Purified 
CBD (15 mg/kg/day) on PND 4-6 and a single oral dose on PND 7, mean AUC0-t values were 142000, 
199000 and 467000 h.ng/mL at 100, 150 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Following daily subcutaneous doses of Purified CBD (15 mg/kg/day) on PND 4-6 and daily oral doses on 
PND 7-70, mean AUC(0-t) values after the final dose were 45600, 75500 and 89500 h.ng/mL for males, 
and 37300, 61200 and 131000 h.ng/mL for females at 100, 150 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Where calculable (for 5/20 profiles), elimination half-lives for Purified CBD were between 4.67 and 11.6 
hours. There was no apparent difference in t½ between males and females, dose routes, dose levels or 
sampling occasion. Where half-lives could not be calculated, this was because there were less than three 
quantifiable data points following Cmax. 
Toxicokinetics for 7-OH-CBD (GWTX18001) 
On PND 4, the mean AUC(0-t) for 7-OH-CBD following a single 15 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of Purified 
CBD to juvenile rats was 497 h.ng/mL. Following daily subcutaneous doses of Purified CBD (15 
mg/kg/day) on PND 4-6 and a single oral dose on PND 7, mean AUC(0-t) values for 7-OH-CBD were 3870, 
4000 and 5160 h.ng/mL at 100, 150 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Following daily subcutaneous doses of Purified CBD (15 mg/kg/day) on PND 4-6 and daily oral doses on 
PND 7-70, mean AUC(0-t) values for 7-OH-CBD after the final dose were 2940, 4130 and 3270 h.ng/mL 
for males, and 3580, 4760 and 6080 h.ng/mL for females at 100, 150 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Elimination half-lives (and consequently AUC0-∞) for 7-OH-CBD were not calculable on PND 4, PND 7 or 
PND 70 because there were less than three quantifiable data points following Cmax. 
Toxicokinetics of 7-COOH-CBD (GWTX18001) 
On PND 4, the mean AUC(0-t) for 7-COOH-CBD following a single 15 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of Purified 
CBD to juvenile rats was 1570 h.ng/mL. Following daily subcutaneous doses of Purified CBD (15

mg/kg/day) on PND 4-6 and a single oral dose on PND 7, mean AUC(0-t) values for 7-COOH-CBD were 
17700, 18900 and 24000 h.ng/mL at 100, 150 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Following daily subcutaneous doses of Purified CBD (15 mg/kg/day) on PND 4-6 and daily oral doses on 
PND 7-70, mean AUC0-t values for 7-COOH-CBD after the final dose were 28900, 86000 and 82600 
h.ng/mL for males, and 25100, 45000 and 130000 h.ng/mL for females at 100, 150 and 250 
mg/kg/day, respectively.  
Elimination half-lives (and consequently AUC0-∞) for 7-COOH-CBD were not calculable on PND 4, PND 7 or 
PND 70 because there were less than three quantifiable data points following Cmax.

Table 5: GWEP1521: Exposure to CBD and metabolites over time (Mean of all age groups) 
Metabolism 
A report concerning potential induction of CYP2C8, 9 and 19 isoenzymes was submitted. CBD was 
evaluated in cryopreserved human hepatocytes in concentrations up to 20 µM. The following conclusions 
could be made: 
• CBD was soluble in incubation medium up to 20 μM. 
• CBD was not cytotoxic to human hepatocytes at concentrations up to 20 μM during the 48 hours 
induction assessment. 
• CBD is unlikely to be an inducer of CYP2C8 or 2C9 at the concentrations tested in the study. 
• There was some evidence for induction of CYP2C19 by CBD in donors 2 and 3. However, a 
concentration-dependent effect was suggested only in donor 3. The calculated R3 value (based on 
the effect seen with CBD concentrations of 1 to 20 μM, only) was >0.8 and therefore this is not 
considered positive for enzyme induction. 
Other toxicity studies 
A new version of the dependence study report ‘Purified CBD: Potential Self-Administration in Male Rats’ 
(GWTX1551) was provided in this procedure. 
The main report is updated stating the no GLP compliance for the Pharmacokinetics Phase of the study. 
and all pharmacokinetics data was removed from main report.  
A new version of the bioanalytical report was submitted with a statement from Principal Investigator 
stating that the quantification of 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD is not reliable. It is presumed that the 
quantification of CBD can be used. Rats were dosed 5, 25 or 75 mg/kg/infusion. Mean AUC0-inf was 195, 
978, 2100 h*ng/mL and mean Cmax was 1390, 6640, 13500 ng/mL. Hence, AUC0-∞ was similar to 
clinically relevant at the highest dose and Cmax higher than clinically relevant at all doses in this study.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Within the initial MAA, the CHMP agreed that Phase II assessment was not necessary for the 0.15 mg/L 
PECSURFACEWATER based on the following: 
1) CBD is already present in the environment as a natural substance in considerable amounts, 
2) has shown a low potential for toxicity in a zebrafish pilot assay (high NOEL of 314 μg/L when 
PECSURFACEWATER for CBD in EU being 0.15 μg/L) and 
3) is highly metabolised in humans, 
the environmental risk of CBD is considered low and no further studies are required.” 
In line with the Q&A document for the ERA guideline (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1) and the ERA 
guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), an updated ERA report was submitted in order to include 
the new proposed indication of TSC. 
The drug substance, cannabidiol (CBD), is a natural component in hemp plants (Cannabis sativa L.) as 
detailed in various publications including by the European Food Safety Authority/EFSA (2011), Florez-
Sanchez and Verpoorte (2008) and Andre et al (2016). The Sponsor uses a process of a chemical 
transformation of milled botanical raw material from Cannabis sativa to de-carboxylate cannabidiolic acid 
(CBDA) and a series of subsequent process stages to the isolation of CBD as a purified drug substance ≥ 
98% purity. CBD is thus placed as a semi-synthetic drug substance, originating from a herbal source. 
CBD is naturally found in hemp plants and seeds. The EFSA (2011) provided a Scientific Opinion on the 
safety of hemp (Cannabis genus) for use as animal feed, and in this report, it is stated that hemp is 
cultivated in Europe to produce fibre, seeds and derived oil. Between 2002-2010, up to ~15,000 hectares 
of hemp have been cultivated per year, giving annual amounts of ~25,000 tonnes of fibre, ~40,000 
tonnes of hemp hurds and ~6000 tonnes of hemp seed. Apart from the major cannabinoid in the hemp 
plant, which is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its acid precursor (up to 90% of total 
cannabinoids), other main components are CBD and cannabinol (CBN). As summarized by Andre et al 
(2016), hemp seed, hemp stem, hemp leaf and hemp flower (each from the fibre-type plant as cultivated 
throughout Europe, rather than the drug-type plant) contain up to 244, 18090, 20000 and 8590 μg CBD 
per gram dry weight, respectively. 
It can therefore be concluded that much greater overall environmental exposure to CBD will occur as a 
result of hemp cultivation in Europe, compared to use of CBD in Epidyolex (CBD) Oral Solution, and also 
taking into account CBD will be metabolised in patients with only a small proportion of the dose excreted 
as parent CBD. 
Nevertheless, based on prevalence of DS, LGS and TSC, the MAH provided an updated PECSURFACEWATER 
estimate as 0.2625 µg/L. 
In line with the Guideline and the previous ERA conclusion, the CHMP concluded that Epidyolex present a 
low risk to the environment and is exempt from performing Phase II environmental risk assessment 
studies. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Three new in vivo studies and a PKPD report were submitted to support the understanding of antiepileptic 
effect of CBD and the new TSC indication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 20/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two in vivo studies of CBD and its active metabolite 7-OH-CBD in the mouse 6 Hz psychomotor model 
(GWPP17072, GWPP18020), including exposure in plasma and brain around tmax, made the basis for a 
PKPD exercise (GWPP18094). Using data from these two studies, ED50 was determined to be 32.1 mg/kg 
for 7-OH-CBD and 49.6 mg/kg for CBD. When brain exposure was considered using results from the PKPD 
report, the potency of 7-OH-CBD was even better (the EE50 values were determined to be 8.7 μM for 7-
OH-CBD and 47.3 μM for CBD). Both compounds appeared highly efficient, however the ED50 values 
should be put into context of human exposure. Although the exposure achieved at ED50 in mouse was 
higher than clinical exposure, analysis using allometric scaling of dose indicated that patients given the 
scaled equivalent of ED50 may exceed exposure observed in mouse. It is noted that brain exposure in 
humans is not known, and the conversion of ED50 in mouse was done by calculating the Human 
Equivalent Doses (HED). Other in vivo seizure studies indicate that mouse may be less sensitive to CBD 
as compared to rat, hence the quantitative EC50 is not of concern even though EC50 are higher than 
human exposure.  
In a third study (GWCRI17024), a rat model was used for characterizing the CBD efficacy and the 
separation to adverse effects in the lithium-pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy (6 weeks treatment). 
This model appears to be a valuable supplement to the more acute seizure animal models discussed in 
the initial Epidyolex MAA and seems relevant as non-clinical proof of concept for the chronic diseases CBD 
is intended to treat (Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and the currently new proposed indication in 
TSC). In this study, a relatively high dose (200 mg/kg/day) was used. Unfortunately, this study was not 
supported with plasma or brain exposure. 
Overall these new pharmacology studies and data support the understanding of the mechanism of action 
of CBD. However, a solid PKPD relationship has not been established. 
Toxicokinetics 
In most of the pivotal toxicity studies provided in the initial MAA, bioanalysis was deemed unreliable or 
not in compliance with GLP. The reports on most pivotal toxicity studies were therefore resubmitted in 
this extension of indication variation with a statement from the Study Director that bioanalysis and 
toxicokinetics was deemed not reliable and not taken into account when concluding on the studies. 
Similarly, the bioanalytical reports were resubmitted with a statement from Principal Investigator 
regarding the analytes which were not deemed reliable. After reviewing the bioanalytical reports and 
validation reports in the iMAA procedure, it was concluded that bioanalysis of CBD was adequately reliable 
but not of the metabolites. The safety margins were therefore only published for CBD. This also applies 
for this procedure.  
One new GLP compliant toxicokinetics study was submitted in this procedure (juvenile rats, GWTX18001). 
Considering the new higher maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/day for TSC patients (as compared to 20 
mg/kg/day for Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut indications), the safety margins for CBD were recalculated 
based on the exposures of TSC patients in the study GWEP1521. They are appropriately reflected in 
section 5.3 in the SmPC.  
The new GLP compliant toxicokinetics study also allow a preliminary basis for calculation of safety margin 
to the major metabolite in humans 7-COOH-CBD (>90% of drug related material in plasma of patients) at 
or below 1. Since the dose of CBD is as high as 1-2 g/day and liver toxicity is a common adverse effect, 
this is still a concern and will be further investigated in the additional studies regarding the safety 
evaluation of 7-COOH-CBD (see below) 
In a study on human hepatocytes, CBD was shown not to be an inducer of CYP2C8, 9 and 19 isoforms.

Toxicology 
No new toxicity studies were submitted with this procedure. During the iMAA procedure, in view of the 
lack of reliable exposure data for the metabolites and apparent low safety margin for the major human 
metabolite 7-COOH-CBD, the MAH committed to provide several non-clinical studies post-marketing. 
In this procedure, given the concerns regarding the high exposure of 7-COOH-CBD in patients in view of 
limited safety margins provided by non-clinical studies, the commitments including the associated 
timelines were further discussed. It was noted that the 2 reproductive toxicity studies of 7-COOH-CBD in 
rat are expected to be completed in Q1 2023, the 10-week juvenile animal toxicology study in Q4 2023 
and the 2-year carcinogenicity study in Q4 2025. 
A commitment for submission of studies supporting safety evaluation of the human major metabolite 7-
COOH-CBD has been provided. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
In view of a new indication, a new maximal daily dose (25 mg/kg vs 20 mg/kg) and a new proposed age 
limit for paediatric patients (1 year of age and older instead of ≤2 years), the applicability of previously 
submitted data the design of the juvenile animal study (JAS) was discussed by the MAH. 
It is agreed that design of conducted Juvenile Animal Study covered the newly paediatric population and 
that the study conforms with the guideline. The liver as target organ for toxicity undergoes a critical 
period of structural and functional growth and development in both neonates (˂ 1 month – 15 years of 
age) and pup rats (up to PND 35). The juvenile toxicity study (GWTX1408) with dosing commenced from 
PND 4 via the subcutaneous route changing to oral (gavage) administration from PND 7 to 70 covered 
this sensitive period. The pathology findings observed in the liver, thyroid, and adrenals on the juvenile 
study were consistent with those observed in the adult rat study. These findings demonstrated full or 
partial recovery following a 6-week off-dose period. 
No neurological effects or effect on long bone growth were recorded. Isolated increase of bone mineral 
density in males of high dose group was reversible during recovery.  Increase of biochemistry parameters 
such as cholesterol, calcium and protein did not result in toxicity findings.  Underlying cause is therefore 
unknown (see initial MAA EPAR). In this procedure, a new toxicokinetic study (GWTX18001) supporting 
the juvenile animal study in rat (oral administration) was provided. This study provides exposure for both 
CBD and the two major human metabolites after sub-chronic dosing (from PND4 to PND70). The safety 
margins were recalculated based on these new data. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP agrees that the available non-clinical data are acceptable to support the proposed TSC 
indication. 
A commitment for submission of studies supporting safety evaluation of the human major metabolite 7-
COOH-CBD has been provided.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical study  
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS in TSC comprises a single, Phase 3, 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial (GWEP1521) that investigated 25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS for the treatment of TSC-associated seizures. 
Table 6 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The following PK data were provided to support the new indication in TSC: 
• 
The PK data collected during the Phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with TSC (GWEP1521)  
•  A pooled Population PK analysis and exposure-response analyses in TSC (GWPP19217) were 
conducted based on the data collected during the CBD-OS clinical development program 
Assessment report

Trial GWEP1521 was a randomized, double-blind (DB), 16-week treatment period efficacy trial, followed 
by a 10-day taper period (or entry into the open-label extension (OLE) phase of the trial). The PK of CBD 
and its major metabolites (based on AUC derived from sparse sampling) were investigated following 
single and multiple doses (MDs) of CBD-OS (or placebo [2:2:1:1 ratio of 25 or 50 mg/kg/day CBD OS 
versus placebo at 25 or 50 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalents]). In addition, the effects of CBD-OS on 
clobazam (CLB) (and N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB)), and other AEDs if taken as concomitant 
medications, were investigated. 
In total, 224 patients (mean age 13.6 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of TSC were randomized, and 
received at least 1 dose of DB investigational medicinal product (IMP), 201 completed the trial, and the 
PK of CBD and its major metabolites were investigated in 104 patients randomized to 25 or 50 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of oral CBD is low (6.49%). 
Effect of Food on CBD Pharmacokinetics 
In randomized controlled trials, patients were not restricted with regards to timing of dose of CBD-OS. 
Food intake was shown to impact the relative bioavailability of CBD with a positive 3-fold increase when 
CBD-OS was taken with a high-fat meal. This increase was moderate when that prandial state was not 
fully known (2.2-fold increase of the relative bioavailability as seen in the GWPP19217 report). The 
estimated magnitude of this food-effect is in agreement with a previously reported 2.5-fold increase in 
CBD bioavailability in healthy subjects (GWPP16110 report).

Table 7 
• 
In the 25 mg/kg/day group, the mean plasma concentration at steady state (predose, end of 
treatment [Day 113]) was 195 ng/mL (range: 73.0 to 452 ng/mL) and mean (CV%) AUC0 t was 
2520 h∙ng/mL (52.4%) and in the 50 mg/kg/day group, mean plasma concentration at steady 
state was 242 ng/mL (range: 42 to 462 ng/mL) and mean (CV%) AUC0 t was 2730 h∙ng/mL 
(87.2%).  
•  On the last day of treatment (Day 113; at steady state), exposures to CBD and its metabolites 
(based on AUC0–t) were similar between the 25 mg/kg/day and the 50 mg/kg/day CBD-OS 
groups.  
•  At steady state, 7-COOH-CBD was the most abundant circulating product followed by CBD and 7-
OH-CBD. 
The metabolite-to-parent drugs ratios based on AUC0 t (summarized in Table 8) increased for 7 OH CBD 
between Day 1 (first dose of 2.5 mg/kg in both treatment groups) and Day 113 (steady state 25 and 50 
mg/kg/day) whereas for 7 COOH-CBD there was a 122% increase in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 212% 
increase in the 50 mg/kg/day group between Day 1 and 113.

Special populations 
There were no effects of intrinsic factors, including age, weight, sex, and race on any PK parameters 
(GWPP19217). 
Total and Inter-subject Variability 
Although non-compartmental analysis was conducted for the patient trials, due to the sparse sampling 
design of these trials, the intersubject variability in patients were better described by the population PK 
analysis GWPP19217. A comparison of intersubject variability estimates for the clearance and volume 
parameters from pooled population PK analyses (Healthy Volunteers and patients) is provided in the 
following Table 9. The estimates of intersubject variability in patients and HV are relatively similar 
(approximately 2-fold higher in patients), despite the expected larger variation in demographics and 
concomitant medication use in the patient population.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
AED Plasma Concentrations 
Where available, plasma concentrations of concomitant AEDs were summarized pre-dose on Day 1 in the 
absence of CBD-OS, and following multiple dosing in combination with CBD-OS or placebo on Day 29, 57, 
85, and end of treatment; blood samples for AED analysis were taken prior to IMP administration on each 
occasion, but no restrictions were placed on when sampling should occur relative to concomitant AED 
dosing. 
Plasma levels of AEDs from Day 1 (pre-IMP) were above the LLOQ for a subset of patients (highest n at 
any time point in any treatment group per analyte: CLB, 17; N CLB, 17; LEV, 22; TPM, 14; VPA, 35). Due 
to limited data and because subjects were receiving a variable number of AEDs, interpretation should be 
made with caution (GWEP1521) 
• 
The majority of patients taking each AED had data at baseline and at least 1 subsequent time 
point; for 4 ene VPA, there were no patients who took VPA that had 4 ene-VPA > LLOQ and this 
was likely because of assay sensitivity.  
•  Mean plasma concentrations of CLB, LEV, TPM, and VPA were similar between the 3 treatment 
groups and did not change during the conduct of the trial.  
•  Mean N-CLB plasma concentrations at all visits had increased relative to predose on Day 1 in both 
the 25 mg/kg/day CBD OS group and the 50 mg/kg/day CBD OS group (Table 10). A total of 
72.8% of patients were not receiving CLB.

Table 10 
•  Mean N-CLB levels in the pooled placebo group were lower than predose Day 1 at all subsequent 
trial visits. As a result, N-CLB:CLB ratios increased from Day 1 predose values in patients taking CBD-
OS whereas in the pooled placebo group, N CLB:CLB ratios were similar throughout the trial.

Decreases in plasma Cmax and AUCtau of VPA (Cmax: 17%; AUCtau: 21%) and 4 ene-VPA (Cmax: 28%; 
AUCtau: 33%) has been demonstrated in patients with epilepsy in GWEP1447, see Figure 4 below:

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
CBD showed anticonvulsant effect in several relevant animal seizure models. The proposed targets are as 
an antagonist on the GPR55 receptor, a TRPV1 agonist inducing desensitization and a reuptake inhibitor 
of adenosine.  
Pharmacokinetic-efficacy Relationships 
A logistic regression was carried out to analyse the probability of a subject being a treatment responder, 
i.e., having at least 50% reduction from baseline in the frequency of TSC-related seizures over 28-day 
periods, in relation to AUC0-12, Day 71 of the 3 analytes. Placebo patients were excluded from this 
analysis.  
Figure 5 
The plot of relative change from baseline for CBD is presented in Figure 5 above. None of the tested 
relationships was statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05. 
In order to investigate the off-CLB exposure-response relationship, a similar logistic regression analysis 
was carried out for the subset of patients who did not receive concomitant CLB therapy. As for the overall 
treated population (i.e. including patients with concomitant CLB) none of the tested relationships was 
statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05. 
Assessment report

Page 29/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic-safety Relationships 
No exposure-response analysis could be performed for severe non-laboratory AEs owing to the very 
limited number of patients within the PK population experiencing events (one patient with severe 
diarrhoea and one patient with severe nausea). No statistically significant relationship (p < 0.05) was 
identified between AUCss of any of the analytes and the AEs included in the logistic regression analysis 
(diarrhoea, loss of appetite, somnolence of any severity). When analysing exposure-response 
relationships for the laboratory AEs, a statistically significant relationship was identified between the 
probability of AST increase above 2 times the ULN and AUCss of 7-OH-CBD. The estimated odds ratio of 
2.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 5.99) for a unit increase in AUCss of 7-OH-CBD denoted a 
relatively shallow exposure-response relationship.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
GWPP19217: Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis and Exposure Response Analysis in Patients 
with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 
A POPPK model was built to derive individual exposure metrics of CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD in 
patients with TSC from trial GWEP1521, using a joint population PK model previously developed in 
healthy adults (GWPP16110), and further refined using sparse data from trials (GWEP1332A, GWEP1414, 
GWEP1423, GWEP1424, and GWEP1521), and to explore (and possibly model) relationships between 
exposure metrics, seizure frequency, and selected AEs (GWPP19217). 
Method 
The population PK model previously developed in LGS patients (GWPP17004) was transposed to the 
current pooled patient population (including information from TSC, DS, and LGS patients). 
The first step was to apply the POPPK Model to the pooled population of patients fixing parameter 
estimates to the values previously obtained. The second step consisted of re-evaluation of the absorption 
model based on the available data. The IIV was estimated to account for the between-subject-variability 
in the patient population. Then, a covariate modelling was performed to integrate the potential significant 
covariates explaining part of the variability. Finally, individual simulation-based exposure metrics were 
derived. 
The POPPK Model structure comprises two compartments for CBD with a linear disposition parameterized 
as CLF-7-OH-CBD, CL10, Q12, VP1, and VP2. CBD was assumed to be sequentially converted into 7-OH-
CBD and 7-COOH-CBD. 
A one-compartment structure was sufficient to describe the disposition of 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD. 
The estimated parameters were apparent formation and elimination clearances. Apparent central volumes 
of distribution were set to 1 L for both metabolites to prevent structural identifiability issues.  
CBD absorption followed zero-order absorption kinetics (duration: D1).  
For the PK/PD analyses, correlations were assessed graphically and if sufficient data was available for a 
quantitative test, then a regression analysis was performed, and statistical significance explored on the 
slope estimate. 
Results 
The population PK analysis was performed on the basis of a population that had measurable observations 
of CBD, 7-OH-CBD and 7-COOH-CBD (408 patients) - who received the CBD-OS at nominal doses of 5, 
10, 20, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day. The model is overall presented, developed and validated in accordance with 
regulatory requirements.  
The apparent multiphasic concentration-time profiles of 7-OH-CBD were adequately described by a 1-
compartment disposition model branched to the 2-compartment disposition model of CBD through a slow 
formation clearance (CLF-7-OH-CBD: 0.012 L/h). The apparent volume of distribution had to be set to 
1 L. Under this assumption, its apparent clearance was 14.44 L/h, all of which formed 7-COOH-CBD.   
The following covariates were considered in the PK analysis: age, race, sex, weight, unit dose of CBD-OS, 
and CLB as a concomitant AED. No covariates had any significant effect of model parameters and thus the 
final population PK model was identical to the base model. Parameter estimates of the final model and 
estimates of IIV on the model parameters are presented in Table 11and Table 12 (below).

The evaluation of the final population PK model did not reveal any bias, allowing the derivation of 
exposure metrics on Day 71.

Within each analyte, all exposure metrics at Day 71 (Cmin, Cmax and AUC) were closely correlated so 
that AUC could be used as a single, representative metrics of exposure for each analyte. The resulting 
efficacy and safety exposure-response dataset included 82 subjects on active treatment. The exposure 
endpoints were derived from the model-based simulations using the individual posthoc parameters and 
the actual dosing history of the TSC patients included in trial GWEP1521. 
Table 13 
The frequency of TSC-related seizures was then calculated for each subject on each day in each AUC 
group, as well as for each dose group (placebo, 25 and 50 mg/kg). The seizure rate change, i.e. the 
relative change from baseline in daily seizure frequency, was plotted against time and differentiated by 
treatment cohort or by AUC group.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
CBD-OS is approved in the EU for use as an adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with LGS or DS, in 
conjunction with CLB, in patients aged 2 years of age and older. In this extension of indication variation, 
the MAH propose the use of CBD-OS in the treatment of seizures associated with TSC in patients 1 year 
of age and older.  
Due to the risk of immature PK pathways, the supporting data for patients below the age of 2 years was 
discussed in regards of posology, efficacy, safety and tolerability. It was acknowledged that the 
pharmacokinetics of CBD have not been comprehensively studied in subjects below 2 years of age and no 
patients below the age of 2 have been providing PK data for CBS metabolites. 
In addition, the main route of clearance of CBD is via hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C19. CBD has been shown to induce major CYP450 enzymes including CYP2C19. Furthermore, CBD 
is an inhibitor of several CYP450 enzymes including CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2C19. 
The MAH argued that CYP450 activity and expression are considered to be equivalent from the age of 12 
months to adults for all major CYP450 isoforms, with the exception of CYP2E1 (Blanco 2000 and Upreti 
2016), the hepatic blood flow rate is equal to that of an adult by the age of 6 months (Yokoi 2009) and, 
by 1 year of age, the serum protein binding rate for acidic drugs, such as cannabidiol, is reported to reach 
that of an adult (Yokoi 2009).  However, it was agreed that the presented information should be carefully 
interpreted, especially in case of drugs with a narrow therapeutic range such as cannabidiol. 
Overall, due to lack of PK data in paediatric patients below the age of 2 years, a complex hepatic 
metabolism of CBD and several potential interactions with AEDs, extrapolation from data in younger 
patients and adults to children below 2 years of age cannot be accepted and the proposed indication in 
patients below 2 years of age is not supported. 
The unmet medical need in this paediatric population is however acknowledged. In order to collect the 
relevant PK data in this infant population, the MAH is invited to extend the recruitment for infants up to 2 
years in Study 9 of the PIP, GWEP 17005, planned/ongoing in infants suffering from TSC from one month 
to 1 year of age and discuss its plan. This was acknowledged and agreed by the MAH. 
Food intake was shown to impact the relative bioavailability of CBD with a positive 3-fold increase when 
CBD-OS was taken with a high-fat meal. This increase was moderate when that prandial state was not 
fully known i.e. 2.2-fold increase of the relative bioavailability. The importance of consistency in prandial 
status when CBD is administrated has been adequately addressed in the SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2. 
Mean N-CLB levels in the pooled placebo group were lower than pre-dose Day 1 at all subsequent trial 
visits. As a result, N-CLB:CLB ratios increased from Day 1 pre-dose values in patients taking CBD-OS 
whereas in the pooled placebo group, N-CLB:CLB ratios were similar throughout the trial. These data are 
consistent with previous trial data where the interaction between CLB and CBD-OS has been evaluated 
(GWEP1332A, GWEP1428, GWEP1543). In these trials, CLB levels have been relatively unaffected by 
CBD-OS co-administration and N-CLB exposure has been shown to increase between 2- and 4-fold when 
CLB is combined with CBD-OS.  
In the proposed TSC indication, a drug class known as mTOR inhibitors may be administered, including 
everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus (a related calcineurin inhibitor). These agents are known to be 
mainly metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. Despite a weak in vitro signal, CBD-OS did not affect CYP3A 
activity in a midazolam probe study (GWEP17028 submitted in the initial MAA), thus there is no 
expectation that combination of mTOR inhibitors (or related calcineurin inhibitors) with CBD-OS would 
lead to a clinically important interaction through inhibition of CYP3A. However, there have been some 
case studies and a retrospective study published (Wiemer-Kruel 2019; Leino 2019; Ebrahimi-Fakhari 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 34/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2019) which suggest that exposures of mTOR inhibitors (and related calcineurin inhibitors) may be 
increased after initiating dosing with preparations of CBD, including synthetic CBD. As mTOR inhibitors 
(and related calcineurin inhibitors) may be administered in TSC and have a narrow therapeutic index, a 
dedicated DDI study trial is planned to determine the potential for CBD-OS to affect the PK of everolimus. 
Pending the availabilities of the DDI results, an appropriate level of caution should be provided and 
information regarding potential interaction and increased plasma concentrations of the mTOR 
inhibitors/calcineurin inhibitors has been added to the SmPC Section 4.5. 
The exposure response analysis in TSC patients did not demonstrate any statistically significant 
relationship between the probability of being a treatment responder (> 50% reduction in TSC associated 
seizures) and exposure to CBD and its metabolites that may indicate that the higher dose levels may 
have resulted in reaching a maximal effect (see also clinical efficacy). 
In an exploratory PK/PD analysis for safety endpoints in LGS and TSC, there was evidence for correlation 
with elevated transaminases. Increases in AST and GGT above twice the ULN were associated with higher 
CBD AUC in LGS patients. Similarly, for TSC, there was evidence for a correlation with AST and the 7-OH 
metabolite. The MAH confirms a statistically significant exposure effect relationship for both CBD and its 
metabolites with elevated liver transaminases (ALT and AST) in LGS (GWPP17004 report). In TSC, this 
correlation was only apparent for 7-OH-CBD and AST but suggests consistency for a drug-related effect. 
However, PK-data together with the safety evaluation on liver do indicate that the effect on liver 
transaminases is predictable with dose and exposure as well as other known risk factors (e.g., 
concomitant VPA use), and is therefore clinically manageable by appropriate dosing instructions and 
monitoring as provided in the SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP agrees that the available pharmacology data support the proposed TSC indication for patients 
2 years of age and older. 
In order to further investigate the potential for CBD-OS to affect the PK of everolimus, the MAH will 
perform a DDI study trial. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS in TSC comprises a single, Phase III, 
randomised, placebo-controlled trial (GWEP1521) that investigated 25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS for the treatment of TSC-associated seizures.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies were performed. Dose selection for phase III was based on clinical experience. 
Thus, by September 2015, when all 5 RCTs (2 LGS, 2 in DS, and 1 in TSC) were being initiated, doses of 
up to 50 mg/kg/day had been used in clinical practice (EAP). 
2.4.2.  Main study 
GWEP1521: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of cannabidiol (GWP42003-P, CBD) as add-on therapy in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis complex who experience inadequately-controlled seizures 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021

The GWEP1521 trial was designed to evaluate 25 mg/kg/day CBD-OS and 50 mg/kg/day CBD-OS vs. 
placebo as adjunctive therapy and consisted of a 4-week baseline period, followed by a 16-week 
treatment period comprising a 4-week titration (dose escalation) period and a 12-week maintenance 
(stable dosing) period ( 
Figure 7). Patients who completed the double-blind phase could transition to the OLE phase of the trial 
where all patients were titrated to 25 mg/kg/day CBD-OS; the dose could then be adjusted to find an 
optimal dose for each patient, with titration up to 50 mg/kg/day if required for better seizure control or a 
decrease in dose if the patient experienced intolerance.  
Figure 7 
Seizure counts were recorded daily during the baseline and treatment period using an IVRS telephone 
diary and were used in the primary and key secondary seizure endpoint analyses. Only patients who met 
seizure frequency criteria, and all other eligibility criteria, by the end of the baseline period could be 
randomised into the trial.

Methods 
Study participants 
For enrolment in the GWEP1521 trial, patients had to be male or female, aged 1 to 65 years (inclusive), 
with a clinical diagnosis of TSC. The patients had to have well-documented clinical history of epilepsy, 
which was not completely controlled by their current AEDs and had to have experienced at least 8 
seizures during the 4-week baseline period, with at least 1 seizure in at least 3 of the 4 weeks; TSC-
associated seizures included: focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness; 
focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness; focal seizures evolving to bilateral 
generalized convulsive seizures and generalized seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic or atonic) that were 
countable. 
To ensure accuracy of seizure identification and reporting, seizure types were verified by members of a 
committee of independent experts from the Epilepsy Study Consortium (ESC). Following the screening 
visit, the ESC reviewed and approved a detailed clinical description of each patient’s current seizures, and 
a list of seizures experienced by the patient in lay terms. The seizure types were either confirmed, or 
further information was requested, by the ESC until agreement was reached.

Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive GWP42003-P 25 mg/kg/day, GWP42003-P 50 mg/kg/day, 
placebo 25 mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent, or placebo 50 mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent at a 
2:2:1:1 ratio. The placebo groups were pooled for the analyses of efficacy. Randomised patients were 
weighed (Day 1) and the daily volumes of IMP solution to be taken during the maximum 4-week titration 
period and for the remainder of the trial were calculated and provided to the patient/caregiver. All doses 
of investigational medicinal product (IMP) were administered orally by the patient or their caregiver twice 
each day (morning and evening); patients who were not able to take the IMP orally and had a 
gastrostomy tube (G-tube) or nasogastric tube were to be discussed with and approved by the GW 
medical monitor prior to using the G-tube or nasogastric tube to administer IMP. The IMP could be taken 
with other concomitant medications, as directed by the investigator. 
Each patient took their first dose of IMP on Day 1 and their final maintenance dose of IMP on Day 113 
(‘End of Treatment’ visit) or day of early withdrawal. Patients who did not enter the OLE study on Day 
113 or who withdrew early, had their IMP dose tapered gradually (10% each day) over a period of 10 
days (unless continuing dosing was not possible due to an AE). Patients participating in the taper period 
returned used and unused IMP to the clinic on Day 123 (‘End of Taper Period’ visit). Patients entering the 
OLE transitioned to OLE IMP over a period of 2 weeks.

Sample size 
A total of 210 patients were planned for randomisation across 4 treatment groups (25 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P, 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 25 mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent placebo, or 50 
mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent placebo) at a 2:2:1:1 ratio. The randomisation was stratified by age 
group (1–6 years, 7–11 years, 12–17 years, and 18–65 years). The placebo groups were pooled for the 
analyses of efficacy. 
It was assumed that patients in the placebo group would experience a mean reduction in seizure 
frequency of 15% (from baseline), patients receiving GWP42003-P would experience at least a 50% 
reduction in seizures and a common standard deviation (SD) of 60%, and therefore this sample size of 70 
patients per group would be sufficient to detect a difference in response distributions with 90% power. 
This test was based on a 2-sided non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for continuous response 
data with a 5% significance level. 
Randomisation 
At the start of the ‘Screening Visit’, a unique patient number was assigned to each enrolled patient using 
the IVRS. After confirmation of eligibility on Day 1, patients were randomly allocated to 25 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P, 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 25 mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent placebo, or 50 
mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent placebo using the IVRS. The randomisation scheme was generated by 
an independent statistician using random permuted blocks, and allocation to treatment at site was 
managed using the IVRS. The randomisation was stratified by age group (1–6 years, 7–11 years, 12–17 
years and 18–65 years).   
Blinding (masking) 
IMP was provided in 100 mL amber glass bottles labelled “GWP42003–P Oral Solution or Placebo”. The 
identity of the IMP assigned to patients was held by the IVRS. The PI at each site, or his/her designee, 
was responsible for ensuring that information on how to access the IVRS was available to the relevant 
staff in case of an emergency and unblinding being required. 
A patient’s treatment assignment should only have been unblinded when knowledge of the treatment was 
essential to make a decision on the medical management of the patient. Unblinding for any other reason 
was considered a protocol deviation. The investigator was encouraged to contact GW to discuss the 
rationale for unblinding prior to doing so. However, to prevent delays to the investigator or medical 
personnel responding to a potentially emergent situation, unblinding of IMP was not dependent upon the 
investigator receiving approval from GW (i.e., the investigator would be able to obtain the code break 
information independent of contacting GW). If the investigator did unblind they were to contact GW 
within 1 working day of the event and were to document the time, date, and reasons for unblinding in the 
patient’s CRF. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The intention to treat (ITT) analysis set included all patients who were randomized and dosed with IMP in 
the trial and had post-baseline efficacy data. Patient data were analysed according to the treatment group 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 43/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to which they were randomized. The ITT analysis set was the primary analysis set for all efficacy 
endpoints. 
The per protocol (PP) analysis set included all patients who completed the trial with no protocol deviations 
deemed to compromise the assessment of efficacy. Patient data were analysed according to the 
treatment they received. The PP analysis set was authorized following blinded data review meetings on 22 
and 25 Mar 2019, prior to unblinding of the database on 27 Apr 2019. 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Change in number of TSC-associated seizures during the treatment period 
compared to baseline period in patients taking GWP42003-P compared with placebo 
The primary endpoint will be analysed using a negative binomial regression model with the total number 
of TSC-associated seizures during the baseline period and treatment period as the response variables. 
A mixed effect model with repeated measures will be performed modelling the observed total number of 
TSC-associated seizures in the baseline period and treatment period implemented within the framework 
of general linear models using the negative binomial response distribution. The model will include 
stratified age group (1–6 years, 7–11 years, 12–17 years and 18–65 years), time, treatment arm and 
treatment arm by time interaction as fixed effects and patient as a random effect. The log transformed 
number of days in which seizure data were reported will be included as an offset. The time variable 
corresponds to an indicator for the baseline period and treatment period. The estimated least squares 
mean seizure rate for each period and the estimated ratio of least squares means for treatment period to 
baseline period and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented for each treatment arm. In addition, 
the estimated ratio of each GWP42003-P arm to placebo and 95% CIs will be presented along with the p-
value testing the null hypothesis that this ratio is 1. For each ratio and upper and lower bound of the 95% 
CI, the percentage reduction will also be presented. 
Missing Data 
If a patient withdraws during the treatment period, then the primary analysis variable will be calculated 
from all the available data, during the treatment period, including any data available after the patient 
withdraws. 
Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint for the blinded phase 
• 
Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the PP analysis set. 
•  Wilcoxon rank-sum test on percentage change from baseline in TSC-associated seizure frequency 
during the treatment period. An estimate of the median differences between each GWP42003-P 
arm and placebo, together with approximate 95% CIs, will be calculated using the Hodges–
Lehmann approach. 
•  A rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on percentage change from baseline in TSC-associated 
seizure frequency during the treatment period.   
•  ANCOVA of log transformed TSC-associated seizure frequency during the treatment period. 
•  ANCOVA on percentage change from baseline in TSC-associated seizure frequency during the 
treatment period. 
• 
• 
Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the maintenance period. This analysis will include only 
patients who have at least 7 days of seizure data within the maintenance period. 
Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the titration period. These analyses will include only 
patients who have at least 7 days of seizure data within each corresponding 4 week period. 
Assessment report

• 
• 
Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the worst case of last observation carried forward 
(LOCF), next observation carried backward (NOCB) and the mean from the non-missing data for 
each patient (rounded up to the nearest integer) to impute missing data arising from unreported 
days in IVRS during the treatment period only (not the baseline period). 
Primary endpoint analysis repeated using multiple imputation (MI) to impute data under the 
Missing Not at Random (MNAR) assumption. For intermittent missing data, in which subjects have 
missing values for intermediate periods but have available data at subsequent periods, imputation 
will be based on the MCMC methodology. Assumptions underlying this partial imputation step are 
that patients will follow a similar outcome trajectory as patients in their respective treatment arm 
that have complete data. The remaining monotone missing data will then be imputed using 
predictive mean matching in which missing observations are imputed with an observed value 
from another patient whose predicated value is close to the predicated value of the patient with 
the missing observation. To test the robustness of the analysis to the MNAR imputations a tipping 
point analysis will be performed. This will be conducted by adding or subtracting a sensitivity 
parameter, k × standard error of the observed average daily TSC-associated seizure frequency in 
the placebo arm at each period, to the MNAR imputations only at the corresponding period. The 
tipping point analysis will be used to explore the robustness of the estimated treatment difference 
to the degree of decrease or increase (positive values of k represent decrease and negative 
values represent increase) in MNAR efficacy from the placebo patients. 
In addition, the following analyses were planned in the SAP Addendum (dated 28 /11/2019): 
• 
Time to 10th and 20th Seizure. The advantage of this proposed time to event analysis is that it is 
distinctly less sensitive to early withdrawals. 
•  Analysis using Worst Case of No Change or Observed Worsening: The negative binomial 
regression (NBR) primary analysis will be repeated penalizing patients in the 25 mg/kg/day or 50 
mg/kg/day treatment arms who withdrew during the blinded phase treatment period. The 
following will be used as the analysis value for withdrawn patients in the active arms:  
o  Patients with a reduction (improvement) in percentage change from baseline during the 
blinded phase treatment period will be imputed by setting the treatment period 
denominator, used in the NBR offset, to 113 days and the seizure count set to a value 
giving the same daily average observed during the baseline period.  
o  Patients with an increase (worsening) in percentage change from baseline during the 
blinded phase treatment period will be imputed by setting the treatment period 
denominator, used in the NBR offset, to 113 days and the seizure count set to a value 
giving the same daily average observed during the treatment period.  
The primary endpoint analysis will be repeated using the above imputation. 
1st Key Secondary Endpoint: TSC-associated Seizure Treatment Responders (≥50% Reduction in TSC-
associated Seizure Frequency) 
Blinded Phase: The proportion of patients considered treatment responders, defined as those with a 
≥50% reduction in TSC-associated seizure frequency from baseline during the treatment period, for 
patients who have not withdrawn from the trial during the treatment period, will be summarized by 
treatment arm and analysed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group. The 
proportion of patients who are considered treatment responders, the difference in proportions along with 
the 95% CI for the difference, the estimated odds ratios (GWP42003-P arms vs. placebo), 95% CI for the 
odds ratios, and the p-values from the CMH test will be presented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 45/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on the ITT analysis set, repeating the above analysis, using data 
for the maintenance period only, the titration period and during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period 
(Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 12 week maintenance period). 
2nd Key Secondary Endpoint: Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change 
Blinded Phase: The SGIC and CGIC response/score, recorded at each visit, will be summarized 
separately, on both a categorical and continuous scale, by treatment arm. It is anticipated that only a 
small percentage of patients will complete the subject version of the questionnaire. Hence, no analyses 
will be performed for the SGIC. A combined score will be used as the primary analysis for this endpoint. 
The combined score will be defined as follows: 
 If both a CGIC and SGIC are completed then the CGIC will be used. 
 If only a CGIC is completed then the CGIC will be used. 
 If only a SGIC is completed then the SGIC will be used. 
The score at the end of treatment visit and last visit (if different to the end of treatment) will be analyzed 
using ordinal logistic regression. Proportional odds modelling will be carried out by including treatment 
arm as a factor. The estimated odds ratio (GWP42003-P vs. placebo), 95% CI for the odds ratio, and the 
p-value testing the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1, will be presented.  
Analysis performed at the last visit will be considered the primary analysis for this endpoint, with the 
analysis at the end of treatment visit considered a sensitivity analysis. Since this analysis uses a 
combination of caregiver and subject ratings, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using only the CGIC 
score and using the same analyses as above. 
3rd Key Secondary Endpoint: Total Seizures 
Blinded Phase: Summaries and analyses of total seizures will be performed as per the primary endpoint. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on the ITT analysis set, repeating the above analysis, using data 
for only the maintenance period, titration period, and during each 4 weeks of the maintenance period 
(Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 12 week maintenance period). 
Multiplicity control 
The primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested with their Type I error controlled by use of a 
hierarchical gate-keeping procedure, in the sequence given in Table 18.

Recruitment 
In total, 46 sites screened patients (25 in the US, 6 in Poland, 5 in Spain, 4 in Australia, 4 in the UK, 2 in 
the Netherlands), of which 44 sites randomised patients into the trial. Of the 224 randomized patients, 
112 (50%) were randomized in the US, 61 (27.2%) in Poland, 24 (10.7%) in Australia, 11 (4.9%) in 
Spain, 9 (4.0%) in the Netherlands, and 7 (3.1%) in the UK. The date of the first informed 
consent/assent form signed by a patient or their parent(s)/legal representative for the first patient to be 
enrolled into the trial was 06 April 2016, the last screening date was 31 August 2018, and the date of the

last trial observation was 15 February 2019. Overall, 201 patients (89.7%) completed the trial and 199 
patients (88.8%) entered the OLE phase of the trial. 
The OLE trial was conducted at 32 sites that enrolled patients in Australia, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, UK, 
and US. The date of first informed consent/assent was 31 August 2016. The date of the interim data cut-off 
was 26 February 2019.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Of the seven protocol amendments, six (Amendments 2-7) were introduced after patient enrolment had 
started. Amendment 2 (August 2016) changed e.g. the target sample size, the frequency of assessments, 
and the primary and secondary analyses. Amendment 4 (June 2017) changed secondary endpoint 
structure, and clarified exclusion criteria relating to mTOR inhibitors. Amendment 5 (Aug 2018) 
introduced a number of substantial changes of e.g. clarification of the treatment allocation ratio and 
inclusion criteria: An inclusion criterion was added to ensure that eligible patients must be taking 1 or 
more AEDs at a dose which had been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Furthermore, 
inclusion criteria were amended to clarify that eligible patients must have a well-documented clinical 
history of epilepsy which is not completely controlled by their current AEDs. Also, it was clarified that the 
investigator may consider temporarily or permanently reducing the dosage in case of poor tolerability, 
and in cases where the transaminase elevation withdrawal criteria are not met or confirmed, the dose of 
IMP or a concomitant AED with known hepatoxicity should be reduced. Amendment 6 (September 2018) 
changed the primary analysis method from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to a negative binomial regression 
analysis. Amendment 7 (April 2019) changed the testing hierarchy moving the GIC and total seizure 
endpoints down in the hierarchy so that all TSC-associated seizure endpoints are tested first. 
Protocol deviations (selected) 
Potential unblinding: 
• One site unblinded a patient after they experienced an AE of rash with eosinophilia. Sponsor medical 
approval was not in place prior to unblinding. The patient was withdrawn. 
• On Day 113 (end of treatment), 1 patient had a positive result for cannabinoids despite being on 
placebo. On investigation, the most plausible explanation was that they took the dispensed open-label 
medication in error as the predose sample was negative. Both double-blind medication and open-label 
medication were dispensed at this visit. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
reported. 
• One patient had a THC test Day 113 (end of treatment) although this was not required. The positive 
result was provided to the site; a positive test for THC is not necessarily unblinding as it may be due to 
noncompliance. The result was also provided to the sponsor, only one person in the biostatistics 
department, who wasn’t the study statistician, reviewed the data and took steps to isolate the data. 
There has been no impact on the data integrity. 
IMP Dosing: 
• Two patients failed to properly titrate (1 in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group and 1 in the 50 
mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group). 
• One patient in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group had a dose reduction in error. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 49/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• One patient in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group took the medication with a drink because the 
patient was uncooperative. 
Concomitant AED Medication Changes During the Trial: 
25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group: 
• One patient had their dose of vigabatrin increased from 1000 mg QD + 1250 mg QD to 1000 mg QD + 
1500 mg QD by an external neurologist. 
• One patient had their dose of zonisamide increased from 75 mg b.i.d. to 100 mg b.i.d. on Day 99; the 
patient was removed from the PP analysis set. 
• One patient had their dose of carbamazepine increased from 450 mg QD + 600 mg QD to 600 mg QD 
by an external hospital due to an episode of status epilepticus; the patient was removed from the PP 
analysis set. 
• One patient had their dose of valproic acid increased from 1000 mg QD to 1000 mg QD + 500 mg QD 
on Day 24; the patient was removed from the PP analysis set. 
50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group: 
• One patient had their dose of vigabatrin increased from 750 mg b.i.d. to 750 mg QD + 1000 mg QD on 
Day 108; the patient was removed from the PP analysis set. 
• One started taking CLB on Day 62; the patient was removed from the PP analysis set. 
• One patient had their dose of levetiracetam increased from 5 mL b.i.d to 6 mL b.i.d. during the baseline 
period; the patient was removed from the PP analysis set. 
Placebo group: 
• One patient had their dose of CLB increased from 20 mg QD + 30 mg QD to 20 mg TID on Day 13; the 
patient was removed from the PP analysis set. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics were similar across the treatment groups. Overall, there was a slightly 
higher proportion of male (58.1%) than female (41.9%) patients; the majority were White/Caucasian 
(89.6%) with the highest proportion coming from the US (49.5%); the mean (SD) age was 13.659 (10.0) 
years.

The distribution of current seizure types reported during the 28-day baseline period was similar across 
the treatment groups, with Type 2 focal seizures being most common, followed by Type 1 focal motor, 
Type 3 focal and tonic. 
Table 21 
A small proportion of patients received concomitant non-pharmacological antiepileptic therapies during 
the trial; 25 patients (11.2%) used VNS and 3 patients (1.3%) used a ketogenic diet, spread fairly evenly 
across the 3 treatment groups. 
A total of 114 patients (50.9%) had significant non-epilepsy medical or surgical history that had resolved 
prior to starting the trial, with similar numbers in each group (40 [53.3%] 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P 
patients, 37 [50.7%] 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P patients and 37 [48.7%] placebo patients); however, 
some epilepsy-related conditions were recorded as non-epilepsy medical or surgical history on the CRF. 
The most common resolved non-epilepsy medical conditions were from the surgical and medical 
procedures SOC (30 [40.0%] 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P patients, 26 [35.6%] 50 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P patients and 26 [34.2%] placebo patients), and the infections and infestations SOC (11 
[14.7%] 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P patients, 9 [12.3%] 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P patients and 5 
[6.6%] placebo patients).

The most common ongoing non-epilepsy medical conditions by PT (i.e., reported in > 10% of patients 
overall) are presented in Table 22; the distribution was similar across the treatment groups. 
Table 22 
The most common classes of AEDs now discontinued (i.e., reported in > 50% of patients overall) were 
other antiepileptics (172 [76.8%] patients), and fatty acid derivatives (152 [67.9%] patients). 
For all of the treatment groups, the median number of AEDs no longer taken was 4 (range 0 to 15) and 
the median number of current AEDs was 3 (range 0 to 5) (Table 23). One patient was enrolled into the 
trial while not taking any ongoing concomitant AEDs. The patient was enrolled under protocol version 5 
which did not explicitly state that patients had to be taking 1 or more other AEDs; the protocol was 
subsequently updated via substantial amendment to clarify this.

Table 23 
The most common AEDs taken concomitantly during the trial were VPA and VGB (Table 24). Overall, 
99.6% of patients were taking at least 1 AED concomitantly during the trial. 
The concomitant AEDs used were similar across the treatment groups for most AEDs; however, CLB was 
taken by fewer patients in each GWP42003-P group than in the pooled placebo group and VGB was taken 
by more patients in each GWP42003-P group than in the pooled placebo group.

A total of 27 patients received concomitant non-pharmacological antiepileptic therapies during the trial. 
Of these patients, 3/26 (11.5%) used ketogenic diet and 25/26 (96.2%) used vagus nerve stimulation 
(VNS); 2/26 [7.7%] used both. Ketogenic diet was used by 1 patient (1.4%) in the 50 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P treatment group and 2 patients (2.6%) in the pooled placebo group. VNS was used by 10 
patients (13.3%) in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 7 patients (9.6%) in the 50 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group, and 8 patients (10.5%) in the pooled placebo group. 
Sixteen patients (4 in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 6 in the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 
and 6 in the placebo group) had previously used cannabis. The majority (11/16) of these patients were 
reported to have used cannabis more than 12 times per year. There were 4 patients who had taken 
cannabis within 6 months of the screening visit. 
Numbers analysed 
All randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP and had post-baseline efficacy data were 
included in the ITT analysis set according to the treatment group to which they were randomised. No 
randomised patients were excluded from the ITT analysis set which comprised a total of 224 patients: 75 
patients in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 73 patients in the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 
and 76 patients in the placebo group. 
All patients who completed the trial with no protocol deviations deemed to compromise the assessment of 
efficacy were included in the PP analysis set according to the actual treatment they received. The PP 
analysis set excluded 30 patients (13 patients in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, 15 patients in 
the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 2 patients in the placebo group) comprising 23 patients who 
withdrew from the trial early, 1 patient in the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group who had new AEDs 
initiated during the trial (reported as an important protocol deviation), and 6 patients who had their AED 
dose increased during the trial (reported as important protocol deviations in 3 patients in the 25 
mg/kg/day, 2 patients in the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P groups and 1 patient in the placebo group). 
Accordingly, the PP analysis set comprised a total of 194 patients: 62 patients in the 25 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P group, 58 patients in the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group, and 74 patients in the placebo 
group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 
Following treatment, the percentage reduction in TSC-associated seizures was greater in both active 
treatment groups (25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day) compared with the placebo group (Table 25). As 
shown in Figure 11 the difference between the 25 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and placebo was statistically 
significant while the difference between the 50 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group and placebo could not be 
regarded as formally significant due to the rules associated with the hierarchical testing approach.

Sensitivity Analyses for the Primary Endpoint 
Results of various sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis e.g. when using the PP 
analysis set, when analysing the percentage change from baseline in TSC-associated seizure frequency 
(28-day average) using a rank ANCOVA approach or when analysing seizure frequency using a log-
transformed ANCOVA approach. 
Results of the primary analysis after imputing unreported days in the IVRS are presented in Figure 12. 
For this analysis, missing data from the treatment period arising from unreported days in the IVRS were 
imputed using the worst (highest number of seizures) of the following for each patient on active

seizures during the treatment period (using the non-missing data). The treatment ratio was in favor of 
CBD-OS over placebo for both GWP42003-P groups (25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day) (Figure 12).

Key secondary endpoint #1: Patients with a ≥ 50% Reduction from Baseline in TSC-associated Seizure 
Frequency 
The proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in TSC-associated seizure frequency 
during the treatment period was higher in the 25 mg/kg/day group (36.0%) and 50 mg/kg/day group 
(39.7%) compared with the placebo group (22.4%). The OR for achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in TSC-
associated seizure frequency did not reach statistical significance for the 25 mg/kg/day group (P=0.0692) 
and therefore the hierarchical testing ended.

Other Seizures 
Other seizures were defined as absence, myoclonic, partial (focal) sensory seizures, and infantile or epileptic 
spasms.  
Of those patients who had other seizures reported during the baseline period, a higher proportion of 
patients in the 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P treatment group (91.7%) experienced any reduction in their 
other seizure frequency during the treatment period compared with in the placebo group (86.7%) or the 
25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P treatment group (75.0%). A higher proportion of 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P 
patients (25.0%) than placebo patients (13.3%) or 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P patients (8.3%) reported 
any increase in other seizures from baseline during the treatment period. 
 Overall 14 patients experienced complete freedom from other seizures during the treatment period; 2 
randomized to 25 mg/kg/day, 7 randomized to 50 mg/kg/day and 5 randomized to placebo.

Rescue Medication Use 
The number of patients who reported any rescue medication use within a 28-day period during the 
treatment period increased in all groups vs. the baseline period (25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P: 68 vs. 16 
patients; 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P: 71 vs. 24 patients; Placebo: 73 vs. 20 patients). The treatment 
difference for the change from baseline in the number of days of reported rescue medication use in 
patients who had been taking rescue medications during the baseline period was numerically in favour of 
GWP42003-P for the 25 mg/kg/day (Figure 21).

In the GWEP1521 study, 22.7% of TSC patients in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 32.9% in the placebo 
group were taking concomitant clobazam. Results of subgroup analysis by clobazam use showed additive 
anticonvulsant effects of cannabidiol in the presence of clobazam.  
In the subgroup of patients treated with concomitant clobazam, patients receiving cannabidiol 25 
mg/kg/day experienced a 61.1% reduction from baseline in TSC-associated seizure frequency compared 
to a 27.1 % reduction in the placebo group, based on a negative binomial regression analysis. Compared 
with placebo, cannabidiol was associated with a 46.6% reduction (nominal p=0.0025) in TSC-associated 
seizures (95% CI: 20.0%, 64.4%). 
In the subgroup of patients treated without concomitant clobazam, patients receiving cannabidiol 25 
mg/kg/day experienced a 44.4 % reduction from baseline in TSC associated seizure frequency compared 
to a 26.2% reduction in the placebo group; based on a negative binomial regression analysis.  Compared 
with placebo, cannabidiol was associated with a 24.7% reduction (nominal p=0.0242) in TSC-associated 
seizures (95% CI: 3.7%, 41.1%).

Summary of main study 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). 
Table 30: Summary of Efficacy for trial GWEP1521 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex) 
Title: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol 
(GWP42003-P, CBD) as add-on therapy in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who experience inadequately-
controlled seizures 
Trial Identifier 
Protocol Number: GWEP1521 
EudraCT Number: 2015-002154-12 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02544763 
Design 
Trial GWEP1521 was a 16-week treatment period, multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of 2 
dose levels of cannabidiol oral solution (CBD-OS) (25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day) vs. 
placebo. An interactive voice response system was used daily to record information on seizures. 
A paper diary was used daily to record information on investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
usage, rescue medication, concomitant antiepileptic drugs, and adverse events. Following a 1-
week screening period and a 4-week baseline period, eligible patients were randomized to 
receive CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day, CBD-OS 50 mg/kg/day, or equivalent volumes of placebo. 
Patients completed a 4-week dose escalation period, titrating up to their assigned dose, before 
continuing on a stable dose of blinded IMP for 12 weeks. Patients who discontinued before the 
end of the treatment phase completed a 10-day taper period (down-titrating 10% per day for 
10 days). 
Following completion of the trial, patients were invited to continue to receive CBD-OS in an 
open-label extension (OLE) trial under the same protocol. Those who opted to enter the OLE 
first entered a 2-week blinded transition period where all patients were transitioned to 25 
mg/kg/day, followed by a 3-week titration period for dose optimization, a subsequent 
maintenance period, and a 10-day taper period (down-titrating 10% per day for 10 days) 
following either the end of treatment or early discontinuation from the trial. Those who opted 
not to enter the OLE completed the 10-day taper period

Endpoints and 
Definitions 
Primary endpoint: 
Primary Analysis: 
Change in TSC-
associated seizures 
during the treatment 
period compared with 
baseline 
Key secondary 
endpoint #1 
Key secondary 
analysis: 
TSC-associated 
treatment responders 
(patients with a ≥ 50% 
reduction in TSC-
associated seizure 
frequency) 
The prespecified primary endpoint was the 
change in number of TSC-associated seizures 
during the treatment period (Day 1 to Day 
113, including the initial dose titration 
period) compared with baseline period.  
The primary endpoint was analyzed using 
negative binomial regression; therefore, 
results were presented with an estimated ratio 
of the ratios of least squares (LS) means 
(treatment period to baseline period) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the ratio, along 
with the p-value testing the null hypothesis 
that the ratio of each CBD-OS group to 
placebo was 1. 
A hierarchical procedure was used to control 
the Type 1 error; for further details see 
‘Hierarchical Analyses’ section in this table. 
The first prespecified key secondary endpoint 
was the proportion of patients considered 
treatment responders, defined as those with ≥ 
50% reduction from baseline in TSC-
associated seizure frequency, during the 
treatment period, for patients who had not 
withdrawn from the trial during the treatment 
period, and was summarized by treatment 
group and analyzed using a Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by age group.

global impression of 
change (S/CGIC) 
Key secondary 
endpoint #3 
Key secondary 
analysis: Change in 
total seizures during 
the treatment period 
compared with 
baseline 
The proportion of patients considered 
treatment responders, the difference in 
proportions along with the 95% CI for the 
difference, the estimated odds ratio (OR) 
(CBD-OS arms vs. placebo), 95% CI for the 
OR, and the p-value from the CMH test were 
presented. If no patients in a treatment group 
were considered responders, then the OR and 
95% CI for the OR were not calculated. 
A hierarchical procedure was used to control 
the Type 1 error; for further details see 
‘Hierarchical Analyses’ section in this table. 
The second prespecified key secondary 
endpoint was the S/CGIC score at the last 
visit comparing CBD-OS vs. placebo 
treatment. 
The scores at the end of treatment visit and 
last visit (if different to the end of treatment) 
were analyzed using ordinal logistic 
regression. Proportional odds modelling was 
carried out by including treatment group as a 
factor. The estimated OR (CBD-OS vs. 
placebo), 95% CI for the OR, and the p-value 
testing the null hypothesis that OR is equal to 
1, were presented. The analysis of the 
patient’s last visit data was considered the 
main analysis for this endpoint, with the 
analysis of the patient’s end of treatment visit 
data considered a sensitivity analysis. 
A hierarchical procedure was used to control 
the Type 1 error; for further details see 
‘Hierarchical Analyses’ section in this table. 
The third prespecified key secondary 
endpoint was the change in total seizures 
comparing CBD-OS vs. placebo treatment. 
The endpoint was analyzed using negative 
binomial regression; therefore, results were 
presented with an estimated ratio of the ratios 
of LS means (treatment period to baseline 
period) and 95% CI for the ratio, along with 
the p-value testing the null hypothesis that 
the ratio of each CBD-OS group to placebo 
was 1. 
A hierarchical procedure was used to control 
the Type 1 error; for further details see 
‘Hierarchical Analyses’ section in this table. 
Hierarchical Analyses  Each endpoint, including the primary endpoint, had 2 comparisons against placebo 
(25 mg/kg/day CBD OS and 50 mg/kg/day CBD OS vs. placebo) and 3 key secondary endpoints 
were defined. The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested with their type I error 
controlled using a hierarchical gate-keeping procedure, in the following sequence:  
1)  Primary endpoint; CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
2)  1st key secondary endpoint; CBD OS 25 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
3)  Primary endpoint; CBD OS 50 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
4)  1st key secondary endpoint; CBD-OS 50 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.

5)  2nd key secondary endpoint; CBD OS 25 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
6)  3rd key secondary endpoint; CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
7)  2nd key secondary endpoint; CBD OS 50 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
8)  3rd key secondary endpoint; CBD OS 50 mg/kg/day vs. placebo.  
The null hypothesis of an endpoint had to be rejected at the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the 
hypothesis  of  the  subsequent endpoint  in  the  sequence  at  the  level  of 0.05  (2-sided).  If a  null 
hypothesis was not rejected, then all subsequent analyses would be declared nominally significant 
or not statistically significant, depending on whether the subsequent P-value was ≤ 0.05 or > 0.05.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking approval for CBD-OS in TSC with dose titration steps at 5 mg/kg/day and 10 
mg/kg/day after which the clinical response and tolerability are assessed up to a maximum recommended 
maintenance dosage of 25 mg/kg/day. The single pivotal trial in TSC (GWEP1521) tested the doses 25 
mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, with a titration regimen was much faster than that in the proposed SmPC. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS in TSC comprises a single, Phase III, 
randomised, placebo-controlled trial (GWEP1521) that investigated 25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day 
Assessment report

CBD-OS for the treatment of TSC-associated seizures. Except for dose levels and titration schedule, the 
trial design adopted resembled that used for the CBD-OS trials in previously authorised indications.  
There is a significant unmet need for new therapies in TSC and the patients randomised in the study are 
representative of a highly refractory patient population.  
Stratification by the use of clobazam would have been preferable given the known interaction between 
clobazam and CBD-OS. However, the trial was initiated before the importance of this interaction had been 
fully realised. 
Discontinuations and dose reductions due to AEs were common in the active treatment arms, and in a 
considerable proportion of cases, caregivers and physicians may thus have been aware of the treatment 
assignment due to AEs (both reported and unreported). 
Primary efficacy endpoint is not fully in line with the EU Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products in the treatment of epileptic disorders and the recommendation that “Two important variables 
should be specified in the protocol. The primary endpoint should be responders/non-responders, where 
responders are patients who obtained at least a certain pre-defined percentage reduction of seizure 
frequency (e.g. a 50% reduction is commonly used). The other variable should be some parameterisation 
using the actual change in seizure frequency.” Nonetheless, the use of 50% responder rate as a key 
secondary endpoint instead of primary endpoint was accepted by PDCO and included in the agreed PIP. 
For the primary analysis, several sensitivity analyses which would have been informative could not be 
performed because of lack of detailed data e.g. about missing visits or rescue medication. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy of the 50 mg/kg/day dose was found to be similar to that of the 25 mg/kg/day dose. The 
safety and tolerability burden was however greater with the 50 mg/kg/day dose. Only the 25 mg/kg/day 
dose of Epidyolex has been proposed for approval. 
There is no evidence of efficacy available for the lower dose level of 10 mg/kg/day in GWEP1521, and the 
similar efficacy profile of 50 mg/kg/day dose to 25 mg/kg/day dose is precluding establishment of a dose-
response relationship or low or high doses to be approved or used for treatment of TSC. 
The primary analysis demonstrated greater reduction in TSC-associated seizures in the active treatment 
groups as compared with the placebo group. The percent decrease in TSC-associated seizure frequency 
was 43.36% in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 20.08% in the placebo group compared to their baseline. 
The sensitivity analyses performed appeared to support the primary analysis. A similar pattern was seen 
for the percent decrease in total seizures for patients who received CBD-OS compared to placebo 
(treatment ratio 0.709, 95% CI: 0.576-0.873; p=0.0013).  
Clinical relevance was not fully supported by the most important key secondary analysis, the 50% 
responder analysis, where the OR for achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in TSC-associated seizure frequency 
did not reach statistical significance for the 25 mg/kg/day group (proportion of responders was 36.0 % 
and 22.4% in the 25 mg/kg/day and the placebo group respectively, P=0.0692). If patients who took 
rescue medication are also considered non-responders only 24.0% in the 25 mg/kg/day vs. 17.1% of 
patients in the placebo group were responders. This is still considered supportive as these results are in 
accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on Multiplicity Issues in Clinical Trials 
(EMA/CHMP/44762/2017): “In a situation in which the primary endpoint establishes a statistically 
significant effect, “the results of the ‘responder’ analysis need not be statistically significant, but the 
difference in the proportions of responders should support a statement that the investigated treatment 
Assessment report

induces clinically relevant effects.” Actually, 16.0% of patients in the 25 mg/kg/day Epidyolex group 
achieved the ≥ 75% response level, compared to no patients in the placebo group (nominal p=0.0003). 
As also observed in studies in other indications, for 25 mg/kg/day group the point estimates for efficacy 
were larger in the subgroup of patients on concomitant clobazam treatment than in the subgroup of 
patients not receiving clobazam. The treatment ratio was 0.753 (95% CI 0.589-0.963) in the subgroup of 
patients not on clobazam but 0.534 (95% CI 0.356-0.800) in the subgroup of patients on clobazam, 
suggesting a treatment effect twice as large in patients on clobazam. Patients receiving cannabidiol 25 
mg/kg/day in conjunction with clobazam experienced a 61.1 % reduction from baseline in TSC-associated 
seizure frequency compared to 27.1 % in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with at least a 
50% reduction in TSC associated seizure frequency in patients receiving cannabidiol 25 mg/kg/day in 
conjunction with clobazam was 47.1% compared to 20.0 % in the placebo group. Concomitant 
administration of cannabidiol and CLB causes an approximate 3-fold elevation in the active metabolite N-
CLB with little or no increase in CLB likely mediated by CYP2C19 inhibition. Literature indicate that both 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between CBD and clobazam may contribute to its 
efficacy in Dravet syndrome. Nevertheless, in the TSC study, 73% of patients did not receive CLB (in 
contrast to 36% in clinical trials with Dravet syndrome) and the results from this subgroup still reached 
nominal statistical significance with CI (0.589-0.963) and the effect can be considered clinically relevant. 
Thus, the clinical efficacy of cannabidiol observed in patients with TSC does not appear only to be driven 
by an interaction with clobazam. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of CBD-OS in TSC has been demonstrated with the proposed dose level of 25 mg/kg/day.  
The recommended posology, with a titration regimen as agreed for LGS/DS indications and with a 
maximum recommended dose of 25 mg/kg/day, is considered acceptable. 
Although the treatment effect was found to be greater with concomitant clobazam treatment, which can 
well be explained by the known PK interaction, the treatment effect of CBD-OS without concomitant CLB 
therapy is statistically significant and clinically relevant. Taking into account that CLB is rarely used in 
TCS and has considerable safety issues, the decision to use concomitantly with CLB should be made 
individually according to patient needs and treatment response, which can be easily monitored. In order 
to support this decision, the relevant data are correctly reflected in the SmPC section 5.1. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In this extension of indication, the clinical safety data are coming from:  
- GWEP1521 trial in TSC, “Pool TSC” (double-blind period, cut-off date 15 Feb 2019) 
- Trial GWEP1521 OLE, “OLE TSC” (ongoing open-label period, cut-off date 26 Feb 2019)  
- completed data from 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in LGS/DS 
- interim data from an ongoing, long-term OLE trial in LGS/DS (Trial GWEP1415 OLE, cut-off date 03 Feb 
2019) 
Supportive safety data are also provided separately from  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 79/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 14 Phase 1 clinical pharmacology trials, as of 30 Apr 2019 
- expanded access and compassionate use programs (EAP) (cut-off date 31 Jan 2019). 
The EAP is a series of physician-initiated and state-supported applications for compassionate access in the 
US and a CAS in New South Wales, Australia, for treatment of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. At 
the data cut-off, the CBD-OS EAP consisted of 38 different sites; 20 sites in the US under physician-
initiated IND applications, some of which also treated patients under state-initiated IND applications, a 
further 7 US sites under state-initiated IND applications only, and 11 sites under the CAS in Australia. 
Results of pooled EAP data were presented in the original MAA; updates are presented in this extension of 
indication, along with new data from European EAPs.

Prior to entering Trial GWEP1521, the largest proportion of patients had used ≥4 AEDs, ranging from 
54.8% in the CBD-OS 50 mg/kg/day group to 60.0% in the 25 mg/kg/day group. In Pool TSC, the largest 
proportion of patients in all treatment groups currently used 3 AEDs, ranging from 35.6% in the CBD-OS 
50 mg/kg/day group to 42.1% in the placebo group. 
Concomitant medications are summarized in Table 39 in terms of AEDs used by ≥ 10% of patients in any 
treatment group. All patients used concomitant AEDs. In the All CBD-OS group, the 3 AEDs used by the 
most patients were valproic acid, vigabatrin, and levetiracetam. In the placebo group the 3 AEDs used by 
most patients were valproic acid, clobazam, and levetiracetam.  
In the OLE TSC, 58 patients (29.1%) used 0 to 2 AEDs, 62 patients (31.2%) used 3 AEDs, and 79 
(39.7%) used ≥4 AEDs).

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Diarrhoea 
In Pool TSC, 64 (43.2%) patients in all CBD-OS group reported diarrhoea while 19 (25.0%) patients in 
placebo group did. 54 patients (36.5%) in all CBD-OS group had diarrhoea that was considered related to 
treatment. One patient had a serious TEAE of diarrhoea, and discontinued IMP due to this event. 
Diarrhoea was considered treatment related in all 13 out of 19 placebo patients who experienced the 
event. No patients in the placebo group had severe or serious diarrhoea, and none discontinued due to 
diarrhoea. Resolution of diarrhoea in Pool TSC was variable. The largest proportion of patients in both 
Assessment report

dose groups had resolution of diarrhoea > 4 weeks (25 mg/kg: 7 out of 23 patients; 50 mg/kg: 12 out of 
41 patients). Diarrhoea was ongoing at the end of the controlled phase of the study for 5 out of 23 
patients in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 3 out of 41 patients in the 50 mg/kg/day group. 
In the OLE TSC, 83 patients (41.7%) in the all CBD-OS group had diarrhoea. The incidence of diarrhoea 
increased with increasing dose, ranging from 31.6% in the ≤20 mg/kg/day category to 50.0% in the >30 
mg/kg/day category.  
Treatment-emergent AEs of diarrhoea were far more common in the TSC population (25 mg/kg/day, 23 
patients, 30.7%; 50 mg/kg/day, 41 patients, 56.2%; placebo, 19 patients, 25.0%) than in the LGS/DS 
population (10 mg/kg/day, 18 patients, 12.9%; 25 mg/kg/day, 65 patients, 21.2%; placebo, 9.6%) 
(Table 45). Diarrhoea exhibited a dose-response relationship in both populations. Time of onset of 
diarrhoea showed a similar pattern in both populations, with the majority of patients having onset 
between 1 and 6 weeks after first dose of IMP. 
Decreased Appetite and Weight Loss 
In Pool TSC, 15 patients (20.0%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, 17 patients (23.3%) in the 50 mg/kg/day 
group, and 9 patients (11.8%) in the placebo group had decreased appetite. Among the all CBD-OS 
group, 27 patients (18.2%) had an AESI of decreased appetite considered related to treatment. No 
patient had a serious TEAE of decreased appetite or discontinued due to this event. The onset of 
decreased appetite was generally evenly distributed over Weeks 1 to 10. Resolution was > 4 weeks and 
in 25 mg/kg/day group for 8 out of 15 patients, in 50 mg/kg/day group for 7 out of 17 patients decreased 
appetite was resolved before the end of the double-blind phase of the trial.  
Among the OLE TSC all CBD-OS group, 31 patients (15.6%) had an AESI of decreased appetite 
considered related to treatment, and 1 patient (0.5%) had a TEAE leading to discontinuation. No patient 
had a severe or serious TEAE of decreased appetite. 
In Pool TSC, a greater proportion of CBD-OS patients met criteria for decreases in weight from baseline, 
whereas a greater proportion of placebo patients met criteria for weight increases from baseline. In the 
all CBD-OS group, 26.4% of patients (30.7% in the 25 mg/kg/day CBD OS group and 21.9% in the 50 
mg/kg/day CBD OS group) had a ≥ 5% decrease in weight, compared with 7.9% of placebo patients. 
Overall, 16.2% of patients receiving CBD-OS (16.0% in the 25 mg/kg/day CBD OS group and 16.4% in 
the 50 mg/kg/day CBD OS group) had a weight decrease of ≥ 7%, compared with 3.9% of placebo 
patients. Eleven CBD-OS patients (7.4%) had TEAEs of weight decreased: 5 (6.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day 
group and 6 (8.2%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group; no patients in the placebo group experienced a TEAE of 
weight decreased.  
In the OLE TSC, 32.7% of patients overall had a ≥ 5% decrease in weight from baseline; 23.6% had a ≥ 
7% decrease; and 15.1% had a ≥ 10% decrease. For All CBD-OS patients, 50.8% had a ≥ 5% increase 
from baseline. A total of 10 patients (5.0%) had TEAEs of weight decreased: 2 (10.5%) in the ≤ 20 
mg/kg/day category; 5 (3.3%) in the > 20–30 mg/kg/day category; and 3 (10.0%) in the > 30 
mg/kg/day category (5 (3.2%) in the ≤ 25 mg/kg/day category and 5 (11.6%) in the > 25 mg/kg/day 
category). Higher proportions of patients met weight decrease criteria in the > 25 mg/kg/day modal dose 
group than in the ≤ 25 mg/kg/day dose group (Table 46).

Among all CBD-OS patients, decreased appetite affected 21.1% and 21.6% of the LGS/DS and TSC 
populations respectively (7.5% and 11.8% of placebo patients, respectively). In the LGS/DS population, 
14.7% of CBD-OS patients (8.6% of placebo patients) had a ≥ 5% decrease in weight, compared with 
26.4% (7.9% of placebo patients) in the TSC population.  
Weight loss and height and failure to thrive 
In the GWEP1521 pivotal trial approximately 75% of the study participants were below 18 years of age. It 
is agreed and accepted in the DS, LGS and TSC populations that treatment with CBD-OS has the potential 
to lead to weight loss or decreased weight gain when compared with placebo and as such decreased 
weight is an ADR in the SmPC and described below the ADR table. 
The GWEP1521 study mandated height measurements as part of study procedures. The median change in 
height was 1 cm for both the all CBD-OS group and the placebo group by end of treatment in the double-
blind phase of the study. The mean change in Height z score for the all CBD-OS group was 0.1 compared 
with 0.2 for the placebo population. The median change in Height z scores for both all CBD-OS and 
placebo group was 0 at the end of treatment. Although these values do not suggest a concerning 
variation between active and placebo groups and does not indicate an effect on growth, the short time 
interval between the baseline and the last assessment makes assessment of these changes of limited 
value. Data on height change in the OLE on the population shows mean and median increases, however 
inspection of the data also yields outliers which make firm conclusions difficult. The nature of the patient 
population may have made taking such assessments logistically difficult. 
Safety endpoints relating to failure to thrive are limited, however to date, no signal has emerged from the 
Tanner endpoint staging for sexual maturation across the DS, LGS and TSC pivotal trials in the paediatric 
population. 
Somnolence, Fatigue, Lethargy, Sedation 
In Pool TSC, 41 patients (27.7%) in the All CBD-OS group and 13 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group 
had at least 1 AESI of somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, or sedation. The incidence of this AESI was higher in 
the 50 mg/kg/day group (34.2% of patients) than in the 25 mg/kg/day group (21.3% of patients). In the 
All CBD-OS group, 35 patients (23.6%) had an AESI of somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, or sedation 
considered related to treatment; 1 patient had a serious TEAE; and 2 patients had a TEAE leading to 
discontinuation. The AESI began 1 to 2 weeks after the first dose for 16.9% of patients in the All CBD-OS 
group. Clobazam use has been identified as a risk factor for somnolence-related TEAEs.  
In the OLE TSC, 49 patients (24.6%) in the All CBD-OS group had an AESI of somnolence, fatigue, 
lethargy, or sedation. The incidence was 36.8% in ≤ 20 mg/kg/day group, 20.7% in > 20–30 mg/kg/day 
group, and 36.7% in >30 mg/kg/day group. Two patients had serious AESIs of somnolence; and 1 
patient had a TEAE leading to discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 91/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The AESI of somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, sedation was more common in LGS/DS population than in the 
TSC population (39.5% vs. 27.7%, respectively) for CBD-OS treated patients. Larger proportions of 
LGS/DS patients than TSC patients used CLB concomitantly. 
Seizure Worsening 
In Pool TSC, 8 patients (10.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, 13 patients (17.8%) in the 50 mg/kg/day 
group, and 7 patients (9.2%) in the placebo group had seizure worsening. 6 patients (4.1%) in the All 
CBD-OS group and 2 patients (2.6%) in the placebo group had an AESI of seizure worsening considered 
related to treatment. Two patients (1.4%) had severe events. Five patients (3.4%) in the All CBD-OS 
group and 1 patient (1.3%) in the placebo group had serious AESIs of seizure worsening. No patient 
permanently discontinued IMP due to this AESI. The onset of seizure worsening was generally evenly 
distributed over Weeks 1 to 14 in both CBD-OS dose groups, with fewer patients having onset at ≥14 
weeks.  
The risk of seizure frequency increases was also evaluated by using seizure count data that was captured 
as part of primary endpoint in trial GWEP1521 (Figure 23). 
Figure 23. Cumulative Distribution Function for TSC-associated Seizures During the Treatment Period: 
GWEP 1521 RCT (ITT Analysis Set) 
In the OLE TSC, 50 patients (25.1%) in the All CBD-OS group had seizure worsening, 19 patients (9.5%) 
are considered related to treatment, 3 patients (1.5%) had severe events, and 4 patients (2.0%) 
discontinued due to seizure worsening. Twelve patients (6.0%) had serious TEAEs of seizure worsening. 
The onset was evenly distributed over time, from Weeks 1 to 2 to > 52 weeks. 
Status Epilepticus 
In Pool TSC, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 1 patient (1.3%) in the placebo group had 
status epilepticus. Status epilepticus was a serious TEAE for all 3 patients in Pool TSC, but it was not

considered related to IMP. For no patients was the event severe in intensity, and none of the patients 
permanently discontinued IMP due to this AESI.  
Abnormal Liver Findings 
CBD-OS caused dose-dependent elevations in serum ALT and AST in some TSC patients, including some 
elevations meeting the consensus criteria for DILI (Table 47 and Table 48). These typically occurred 
within the first 2 months of treatment with CBD-OS. Clear risk factors for ALT elevations included 
concomitant use of VPA, dose of CBD-OS, and elevated ALT at baseline.  
There were no Hy`s Law cases (ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN) in either Pool TSC or TSC 
OLE. The ALT elevations were generally accompanied by normal ALP and bilirubin values. R values were 
generally > 5 indicating a hepatocellular pattern of DILI. There was no clear increased risk associated 
with concomitant use of AEDs other than VPA. The estimated time required for a peak ALT elevation (≥ 5 
× ULN) to recover to a value of 2.9 × ULN was calculated for each patient.  The recovery times estimated 
were commonly less than 2 weeks for patients who had treatment with CBD-OS abruptly discontinued, 
continued and/or tapered then discontinued, or continued at the same or lower daily dose.

Renal Effects 
No TEAEs but increases from baseline in creatinine were noted among patients receiving CBD-OS. Mean 
increases in creatinine from baseline to end of treatment were approximately 10%, occurring by Day 15

and tending to plateau, with no clear increase over the duration of the pivotal trial. Dose-relationship was 
unclear during the maintenance phase of treatment. 
Significant Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) 
In Pool TSC, 4 patients (5.3%) in 25 mg/kg/day group, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, 
and no patients in the placebo group had at least 1 AESI of significant CVD. 1 patient in the All CBD-OS 
group had a significant CVD AESI (preferred term: electrocardiogram abnormal) considered related to IMP 
and permanently discontinued IMP. 
In the OLE TSC, 15 patients (7.5%) in the All CBD-OS group had at least 1 AESI of significant CVD, 4 
patients (2.0%) had events considered related to IMP. Three patients (1.5%) had a severe event, and 3 
patients had serious events. No patient permanently discontinued IMP.  
It is important to consider the underlying pathophysiology in patients with TSC, as there is often a clinical 
presentation of rhabdomyoma and tumours across the body, which may present or increase 
cardiovascular events. The heart is one of the more common target organs for the rhabdomyomas. In 
totality, 6 patients in the double-blind phase had at least one AESI significant of CVD, and additionally 15 
patients in the OLE had an AESI significant of CVD.  
Rash, Generalized Maculopapular Rash 
In Pool TSC, 5 patients (6.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, 9 patients (12.3%) in the 50 mg/kg/day 
group, (9.5% of all CBD-OS patients) and 3 patients (3.9%) in the placebo group had at least 1 event of 
rash, generalized maculopapular rash. 1 additional patient with a generalized rash was reported as Type 
IV hypersensitivity reaction. Rash events were considered related to IMP for 9 CBD-OS patients (6.1%) 
and 1 (1.3%) placebo patient. Two CBD-OS patients (1.4%) had severe events, and 3 CBD-OS patients 
(2.0%) had serious events; 1 patient had a serious hypersensitivity reaction, and 1 patient had serious 
urticaria, concomitant with serious diarrhoea. Six patients (4.1%) permanently discontinued IMP due to a 
rash AESI. For all patients except one, onset of rash was during Weeks 1 to 10. 
Aggression, Irritability 
In Pool TSC, 6 patients (8.0%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, 7 patients (9.6%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, 
and 6 patients (7.9%) in the placebo group had at least 1 event of aggression, irritability. Events for 7 all 
CBD-OS patients (4.7%) and 5 (6.6%) placebo patients were considered related to IMP.  
In the OLE TSC, 14 patients (7.0%) in the All CBD-OS group had at least 1 aggression AESI, 1 patient 
(0.5%) permanently discontinued IMP. 
Agitation and Psychosis 
In Pool TSC, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, 6 patients (8.2%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, 
and 5 patients (6.6%) in the placebo group had at least 1 event of agitation and pyschosis. Events were 
considered related to IMP for 8 All CBD-OS patients (5.4%) and 2 (2.6%) placebo patients. 
Pneumonia 
In Pool TSC, 3 patients (4.0%) in the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 50 
mg/kg/day group, and 1 patient (1.3%) in the placebo group had at least 1 event of pneumonia. 
DRESS 
DRESS was defined as a reaction including acute skin rash, involvement of an internal organ, enlarged 
lymph nodes at 2 sites, certain blood count abnormalities, and fever.

In Pool TSC, 3 patients (4.0%) in the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group, 1 patient (1.4%) in the 50 
mg/kg/day group, and no patients in the placebo group had at least 1 event corresponding to individual 
AESIs relating to DRESS. All considered related to IMP. One patient (0.7%) in the All CBD-OS group had 
a severe event, which was also serious (PT: rash erythematous). Two patients permanently discontinued 
IMP due to a DRESS AESI (PTs: eosinophil count increased; rash; rash erythematous. 
Overdose and Abuse 
The data from the human abuse liability trial, GWEP1431, demonstrate that even at supratherapeutic 
doses, the relative abuse potential of CBD-OS is significantly lower than that of dronabinol and 
alprazolam. The incidence of abuse liability AESIs was < 2% in both the LGS/DS and TSC populations.  
The MADDERS program conclusions for the TSC population were the same as those for the LGS/DS 
population: CBD-OS poses minimal abuse potential. 
Discontinuation of CBD-OS in TSC, DS and LGS clinical trials did not show clinical symptoms associated 
with psychological or physical drug dependence.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred in Pool TSC. In OLE TSC, one death occurred, giving a rate of 6.54 per 1000 patient-
years. The patient died due to cardiopulmonary failure due to TSC. The patient had a history of idiopathic 
dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, and TSC with 
cardiac involvement.  
Table 49 summarizes SAEs reported for more than 1 patient in Pool TSC. 16 patients (21.3%) in the 25 
mg/kg/day group, 10 patients (13.7%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, and 2 patients (2.6%) in the placebo 
group experienced at least 1 serious TEAE. For 8 patients (10.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 6 
patients (8.2%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, serious TEAEs were considered related to treatment. The 
only treatment-related serious TEAEs that occurred in more than 1 patient were ALT increased (1 patient 
in the 25 mg/kg/day group and 2 patients in the 50 mg/kg/day group) and AST increased (1 patient in 
the 25 mg/kg/day group and 2 patients in the 50 mg/kg/day group).

The absolute rate of LGS/DS patients treated with CBD-OS who experienced at least one serious TEAE 
was 19.7% in all CBD-OS, 8.9% in placebo groups, while it was 17.6% in all CBD-OS, 2.6% in placebo 
groups for TSC patients. The relative risk of experiencing a serious TEAE was greater in the TSC 
population than in the LGS/DS population. Liver-related TEAEs contributed to the higher relative risk in 
TSC patients. A larger proportion of TSC patients had serious TEAEs considered related to IMP (All CBD-
OS, 9.5%; placebo, 0) than did LGS/DS patients (All CBD-OS, 6.6%; placebo, 0.3%). Treatment-related 
skin and subcutaneous disorders and liver-related TEAEs contributed to this difference.

Laboratory findings 
Potentially Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram Findings 
In Pool TSC, 9 patients (12.0%) in the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 50 
mg/kg/day group, and 4 patients (5.3%) in the placebo group had changes in QTc from baseline > 480 
msec. Six patients (8.0%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, and 
3 patients (3.9%) in the placebo group had QTc changes from baseline > 500 msec.  
The following TEAEs related to ECG findings were each reported for 1 patient in Pool TSC (treatment 
group in parentheses): ECG signs of ventricular hypertrophy (50 mg/kg/day); ECG QT prolonged (25 
mg/kg); ECG abnormal (25 mg/kg); ECG QRS complex prolonged (placebo). 
In the OLE TSC, 8 patients overall (4.0%) had changes in QTc from baseline > 480 msec. Six patients 
(3.0%) had QTc changes from baseline > 500 msec. One patient, in the > 20–30 mg/kg/day category, 
had a TEAE of ECG QT prolonged. 
Safety in special populations 
The safety profile of CBD-OS was generally similar across the age or sex subgroups and did not appear to 
influence the tolerability of CBD OS. Because of low heterogeneity in race composition in the RCTs, it was 
not possible to form safety conclusions based on race. Region in the GWEP1521 trial did not appear to 
affect the safety profile of CBD-OS. 
No pregnancies or instances of lactation occurred during Trial GWEP1521 as of the cut-off date. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions were not formally investigated in the trial GWEP1521 but have been explored in 
clinical pharmacology studies. 
Concomitant Antiepileptic Drugs 
There was a higher TEAE burden, either serious or leading to discontinuation, when patients were taking 
a greater number of concomitant AEDs. 
In both LGS/DS and TSC patients, the number of AEDs did have some effect on the overall safety profile. 
Across the disease populations, the use of > 4 AEDs was associated with increased incidences of serious 
TEAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, as well as with somnolence-related AESIs.  
Among All CBD-OS patients, 56.1% of those with LGS/DS used CLB, compared with 24.3% of patients 
with TSC. Valproic acid was used by 52.4% of All CBD-OS patients with LGS/DS and 43.9% of patients 
with TSC. VGB was used by far more TSC patients (All CBD OS: LGS/DS, 2.4%; TSC, 38.5%). Valproic 
acid and VGB were the most commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs in Pool TSC.  
Valproic Acid 
More patients taking VPA had serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP than 
did patients not taking the drug. Liver-related TEAEs were more frequent and the risk of hepatocellular 
injury was clearly increased in patients taking VPA. There was evidence of a higher relative risk of 
decreased appetite and an increased incidence of decreases in platelet count. It should also be noted that 
in the placebo group of both populations, there was also an increased incidence of decreases in platelet 
count, suggesting an independent effect of VPA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 97/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vigabatrin 
VGB was the second most commonly prescribed concomitant AED in the TSC population, it was used by < 
3% of LGS/DS patients. Patients on VGB more frequently had normal-to-low shifts in platelet count than 
those patients off VGB.  
Clobazam 
Clobazam is an important risk factor for AEs such as somnolence/sedation, pneumonia, and rash, and 
there are known PK-based drug-drug interactions between CLB and CBD-OS. The incidence of AEs and 
serious AEs were higher for CBD-OS vs. placebo, and highest in patients taking CBD-OS and concomitant 
CLB. 
An effect of CLB use was evident in both TSC and LGS/DS populations. Higher percentages of patients 
using CLB had serious TEAEs than those not using CLB, across all dose groups and placebo groups for 
both populations.  
The incidence of potential ADRs in patients on vs. off CLB in the TSC RCT is presented in Table 52.

Table 52  
Everolimus 
In GWEP1521, 6 TSC patients in the OLE were taking concomitant CBD-OS and everolimus. One patient 
had elevated everolimus concentrations reported as an AE that resulted in an everolimus dose 
interruption and dose reduction at restart, 1 patient had a dose interruption for everolimus and resumed 
treatment at the same dose. Two other patients had a dose reduction for everolimus, and 1 patient 
discontinued everolimus treatment. For the remaining patient, the everolimus dose was not changed or 
interrupted. 
In the 1415 OLE, 3 patients with LGS were taking mTOR inhibitors (1 everolimus and 2 tacrolimus) 
concomitantly with CBD-OS. The patient taking everolimus had a reduction in everolimus dose; 1 patient 
taking tacrolimus had a dose reduction, and the other had various tacrolimus dose modifications. 
There were reports of 3 patients in the EAP of patients taking concomitant CBD OS and everolimus. Each 
of the patients had an increase in everolimus trough levels approximately 2- to 3-fold from baseline, with 
1 patient discontinuing everolimus treatment due to elevated trough levels.  
In all the cases, AEs commonly associated with mTOR or calcineurin inhibitors such as non-infectious 
pneumonitis or stomatitis were not reported. 
The mechanism of drug–drug interaction between concomitant CBD and everolimus is still unknown and a 
DDI study of CBD-OS and everolimus has been initiated.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Pool TSC, dose was temporarily reduced for 17.8% of patients in the 50 mg/kg/day group and for 
5.3% of patients in the 25 mg/kg/day group and was permanently reduced for 26.0% of patients in the 
50 mg/kg/day group and 8.0% in the 25 mg/kg/day group. 10 patients (13.7%) in the 50 mg/kg/day 
group, 8 patients (10.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, and 2 patients (2.6%) in the placebo group 
permanently discontinued IMP due to TEAEs. Events leading to discontinuation that occurred in more than 
Assessment report

1 patient were ALT increased, somnolence, rash, and urticaria. All TEAEs leading to discontinuation in 
Pool TSC were considered treatment related. 
In the OLE TSC, 10 patients (6.7%) in the >20–30 mg/kg/day category and 1 patient (5.3%) in the ≤ 20 
mg/kg/day category permanently discontinued IMP due to TEAEs. In updated groups for OLE TSC, 11 
patients (5.5%) permanently discontinued CBD-OS; all of these patients were receiving ≤ 25 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS. The only TEAE leading to discontinuation that occurred in more than 1 patient was seizure (4 
patients in the ≤ 25 mg/kg/day category). This TEAE was considered related to treatment for 2 patients 
(1.3%). 
Larger proportions of TSC patients compared with LGS/DS patients had the IMP temporarily reduced (All 
CBD-OS, 11.5% vs. 2.9%, respectively), permanently reduced (16.9% vs. 7.5%), interrupted (3.4% vs. 
0.9%), or permanently discontinued (12.2% vs. 7.7%). The increase in permanent discontinuations in 
the TSC population compared to the LGS/DS population was driven by a higher incidence of permanent 
discontinuations in the CBD-OS 50 mg/kg/day group, which had a higher incidence of SAEs. 
In the LGS/DS population, 7.7% of all CBD-OS patients (1.0% of placebo) permanently discontinued IMP 
due to a TEAE, compared with 12.2% of all CBD-OS patients (2.6% of placebo) in the TSC population. In 
both populations, the most common events leading to discontinuation included liver related events and 
somnolence.  
Post marketing experience 
CBD-OS was approved in June 2018 in the USA and launch in November 2018. Patient exposure to 
Epidiolex in the USA is estimated at 100,000 patient-months. No new validated safety signals have arisen 
from the post-marketing data as of the data cut-offs for this submission. 
Epidyolex was approved in Europe on 19 September 2019. No post-marketing data are available from 
Europe as of the data cut-offs for this variation. The first periodic benefit-risk evaluation report/periodic 
safety update report was submitted 03 March 2020, with a cut-off date of 24 December 2019, and did 
contain a small amount of post-marketing safety data from the EU, although the majority arose from the 
USA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary source of safety data with CBD-OS in the TSC target population consists of the pivotal Phase 
III study GWEP1521 (Pool TSC) and GWEP1521 OLE as open label extension (OLE TSC). The number of 
all TSC patients exposed to 25 and 50 mg/kg/day for 16 weeks in the clinical program is 75 and 73 
patients respectively, while there are no patients exposed to 10 mg/kg/day dose.  
The ICH E1 guidance (CPMP/ICH/375/95) states that “100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year is 
considered to be acceptable to include as part of the safety database. The data should come from 
prospective studies appropriately designed to provide at least one year exposure at dosage levels 
intended for clinical use.” According to the recommended dosing, the number of TSC patients exposed to 
CBD-OS in a double-blind randomized clinical trial setting, for 6 months or 1 year, is therefore not 
sufficient. There are no TSC patients who were tested for 10 mg/kg/day maintenance dose and 75 
patients for 25 mg/kg/day dose for 16 weeks. However, in the context of the orphan designation of TSC, 
TSC OLE and long-term exposure from EAP has been taken into consideration and, in total, 115 TSC 
patients have been exposed to CBD-OS > 1 year duration. The CHMP agrees that the patient exposure is 
acceptable.

In TSC population, the largest proportion of patients were aged 6 to 11 years (27.7% in the All CBD-OS 
group; 28.9% in placebo), mostly white and male (90.5% and 58.1% respectively in CBD-OS group). 
Mean age of patients in the 25 mg/kg/day group was slightly older (14.1 years) than in the 50 mg/kg/day 
group (12.8 years). More patients were from US in placebo group (55.3%), compared to CBD-OS group 
(47.3%). In the CBD-OS groups, mean body weight (42.43 kg) and mean BMI (20.46 kg/m2) were 
slightly higher in the placebo group (44.56 kg and 22.08 kg/m2). The MAH explains that the lower BMI in 
the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group than in the 50 mg/kg/day group may reflect the taller height (at older 
mean age) of patients in this group. In the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group, 5.3% of patients reported 
previous use of cannabis, compared to 8.2% of patients in the 50 mg/kg/day group and 7.9% of patients 
in the placebo group. Among patients reporting previous cannabis use, mean time since last use to first 
dose of IMP was 14.3 months for the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group, 13.3 months for the 50 mg/kg/day 
group, and 41.6 months for the placebo group. 
In OLE phase most of the patients were in the 20-30 mg/kg/day group (n=150) and other two groups 
were small in number (n=19 in <=20 mg/kg/day group, n=30 in >30 mg/kg/day group), so any 
comparisons should be made carefully. There seems to be a reverse correlation of dose and mean or 
median age (16.9 or 16.3 years for <=20 mg/kg/day group, 12.9 or 10.1 for n=30 in >20-30 mg/kg/day 
group, 12.0 or 9.9 years for >30 mg/kg/day group), higher dose in younger patients. Sex distribution 
was imbalanced between dose groups, especially for the lowest dose group having mostly females 
(63.2% vs 37.3 and 43.3 in other groups). Country and region also had significant imbalance between 
groups. 
As expected, regarding prior and concomitant medication use, most patients used 3 or more AEDs in Pool 
TSC or OLE TSC. In the All CBD-OS group, the 3 AEDs used by the most patients were valproic acid, 
vigabatrin, and levetiracetam. 
There is a clear treatment and dose related increase in the incidences of TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation, serious TEAEs, and these groups had same trend for TEAEs being considered 
treatment related by the investigator. This is concerning as it may signal dose related increase in adverse 
events and possible unblinding in all groups due to properties of the pharmaceutical product and/or 
adverse event profile.  
After many treatment related events and discontinuations up to the dose of 30 mg/kg/day, there seems 
to be a very small group of patients remaining who could tolerate these doses without further 
discontinuation due to TEAEs.  
Diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and somnolence were the 3 most frequently occurring TEAEs and showed 
higher frequency in higher dose group. Pyrexia, constipation, GGT increased, and cough were more 
common in the 25 mg/kg/day CBD OS group. Liver-related TEAEs also showed a dose-response 
relationship. In OLE TSC, the 3 most frequently occurring TEAEs in the CBD-OS group were diarrhoea, 
seizure, and decreased appetite (all reported for > 19% of patients). The most common TEAEs were the 
same between LGS/DS and TSC populations, although incidence was generally higher in the TSC 
population. Liver enzyme increases, pyrexia and vomiting had more significant signal and higher 
incidence in the TSC trial compared to Pool LGS/DS.  
Diarrhoea is very common dose related TEAE occurring in up to 43.2% of the population treated with 
CBD-OS with a potential for leading to discontinuation of treatment, being serious and potential risk for 
unblinding. Information regarding diarrhoea has been correctly reflected in the SmPC section 4.8.   
In Pool TSC, a greater proportion of CBD-OS patients met criteria for decreases in weight from baseline, 
whereas a greater proportion of placebo patients met criteria for weight increases from baseline, and the 
relative risk of weight loss was higher in the TSC population than in the LGS/DS population. In OLE TSC, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 101/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher proportions of patients met weight decrease criteria in the > 25 mg/kg/day modal dose group than 
in the ≤ 25 mg/kg/day dose group. The relevant weight loss/absence of weight gain information is 
reflected in the SmPC section 4.8 and a warning that continuous weight loss/absence of weight gain 
should be periodically checked to evaluate if cannabidiol treatment should be continued is added in 
section 4.4. 
Somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, or sedation are very common dose related AE occurring in 27.7% of CBD-
OS treated population with a potential for leading to discontinuation of treatment, being serious and 
potential risk for unblinding in clinical studies. A relationship with clobazam use and enhancement of its 
effects and side effects could be speculated. 
As experienced with LGS/DS, seizure worsening was observed in Pool TSC. 8 patients (10.7%) in the 25 
mg/kg/day group, 13 patients (17.8%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, and 7 patients (9.2%) in the placebo 
group experienced worsening in seizures showing a dose related pattern. The distinctly increased number 
of patients who experienced treatment-emergent seizure in the OLE phase was noted in all subgroups. 
Seizure was added in the SmPC section 4.8 as ADR together with a description of the observations. This 
is acceptable. 
The observations concerning the liver safety of CBD-OS in TSC patients are consistent with observations 
that have been made in the larger DS and LGS populations and necessary actions are taken by MAH. 
Haematological and renal changes observed in TSC patients treated with CBD-OD were similar to findings 
with LGS/DS patients. Decrease in Hb, Hct and platelets, increase in creatinine are observed.  
In Pool TSC, 4 patients (5.3%) in 25 mg/kg/day group, 2 patients (2.7%) in the 50 mg/kg/day group, 
and no patients in the placebo group had at least 1 AESI of significant cardiovascular disease. 1 patient in 
the All CBD-OS group had a significant CVD AESI (preferred term: electrocardiogram abnormal) 
considered related to IMP and permanently discontinued IMP. In the OLE TSC, 15 patients (7.5%) in the 
All CBD-OS group had at least 1 AESI of significant CVD, 4 patients (2.0%) had events considered related 
to IMP. Three patients (1.5%) had a severe event, and 3 patients had serious events. No patient 
permanently discontinued IMP. As such, there is an imbalance in the CVD AESI between CBD groups and 
placebo in the pivotal trial. TSC population has an intrinsic risk of experiencing cardiac events which 
might be triggered or worsened by treatment. It is noted that a thorough QTc trial in the fed state is 
scheduled to provide robust additional data on any CBD-OS effect on QTc at therapeutic and supra-
therapeutic exposures (results estimated in September 2021). Pending the results of the QTc study and 
considering the cardiovascular monitoring adopted as standard of care for TSC patients, it is acceptable to 
add cardiovascular risk evaluation and expected QTc results in the RMP, with regular review in the next 
PSURs. The SmPC section 4.4 specifies that patients with cardiovascular impairment were not included in 
the clinical development program. 
Generalized maculopapular rash is very common dose related AE occurring in 9.5% of all CBD-OS 
patients, 4.1% leading to discontinuation of treatment and has a potential risk for unblinding in clinical 
studies due to no severe events, serious events, or events leading to discontinuation for rash reported in 
placebo patients. Rash is already identified as risk and followed in PSURs by MAH.  
In Pool TSC, 3 patients (4.0%) in the CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day group, 1 patient (1.4%) in the 50 
mg/kg/day group, and no patients in the placebo group had at least 1 event corresponding to individual 
AESIs relating to DRESS. All considered related to IMP. One patient (0.7%) in the All CBD-OS group had 
a severe event, which was also serious (PT: rash erythematous). Two patients permanently discontinued 
IMP due to a DRESS AESI (PTs: eosinophil count increased; rash; rash erythematous).

Aggression, irritability, agitation and psychosis are observed in TSC patients treated with CBD-OD, similar 
to findings with LGS/DS patients. Suicidality related TEAE was not observed. CBD-OS poses minimal 
abuse potential and < 2% incidence of abuse liability AESIs.  
Across the disease populations, the use of > 4 AEDs was associated with increased incidences of serious 
TEAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, as well as with somnolence-related AESIs. Valproic acid 
(43.9%) and VGB (38.5%) were the most commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs and CLB was used by 
24.3% of patients in all CBD-OS group in Pool TSC. A DDI study of CBD-OS and everolimus has been 
initiated (see also clinical pharmacology section). In the interim, a statement recommending caution 
when using CBD-OS concomitantly with mTOR inhibitors or calcineurin inhibitors is added in SmPC section 
4.5. 
Increased number of temporary or permanent dose reductions, discontinuation due to TEAEs, and 
discontinuations due to treatment related TEAEs were observed with TSC patients, especially in higher 
dose group compared to LGS/DS experience in clinical trials. In Pool TSC, 10 patients (13.7%) in the 50 
mg/kg/day group, 8 patients (10.7%) in the 25 mg/kg/day group, and 2 patients (2.6%) in the placebo 
group permanently discontinued IMP due to TEAEs. Events leading to discontinuation that occurred in 
more than 1 patient were ALT increased, somnolence, rash, and urticaria. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available safety data, the CHMP concludes that the safety profile in the TSC indication, an 
orphan condition, is acceptable. 
The highlighted safety concerns will continue to be managed through the agreed RMP and monitored via 
the PSURs. 
The CHMP noted that a thorough QTc trial in the fed state is scheduled at therapeutic and supra-
therapeutic exposures.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of the extension of indication to TSC, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 
of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to correct typographic errors and implement editorial updates as well 
as implement the updated ethanol statement in compliance with the EC Guideline on Excipient. In 
addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of Sweden. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report referring to Epidyolex. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been 
found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterised by the formation of non-malignant 
tumours (tubers) in multiple organ systems. Mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene may cause tuberous 
sclerosis complex. The TSC1 and TSC2 genes code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively.

These proteins normally act as tumour suppressors. The incidence rate is approximately 1:10000 to 
1:5000 live births. Prevalence may be underestimated but in Europe is usually given as 1:25000 to 
1:5000. TSC is a chronic, life-long condition. Tumours in TSC patients occur primarily in the brain, eyes, 
heart, kidney, skin, and lungs. Epileptic seizures are the most common neurological manifestation of TSC, 
affecting more than 70% of patients. Seizure onset occurs within the first year of life in approximately 
two-thirds of TSC patients. The onset of epilepsy in TSC commonly manifests as focal motor seizures, 
which in approximately one-third of TSC patients coexist with infantile spasms. Virtually all TSC patients 
with infantile spasms and approximately half of all epileptic TSC patients without them develop multiple 
seizure types, including complex focal seizures (with or without secondary generalization), generalized 
tonic-clonic seizures, atonic seizures, and atypical absences. Infantile spasms resolve with time, but the 
frequency and severity of other seizures tend to increase throughout early childhood and nearly two-
thirds of TSC patients develop medically intractable epilepsy. Morbidity and mortality are increased in 
patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies, including TSC. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is one 
of the most common causes of death. Recurrent seizures often lead to intellectual and developmental 
disabilities and contribute to an increased risk of injury and death. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most patients with TSC take between 3 and 5 AEDs. However, such treatment regimens rarely provide 
sufficient seizure control and are often accompanied by intolerable side effects.  
The only approved therapy for TSC-associated seizures in the EU is the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. 
Everolimus was originally approved in the EU in 2011 (as Votubia) to treat tumours in TSC patients aged 
3 years and older, and the indication was subsequently extended in 2017 to include adjunctive treatment 
of adult and paediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures. 
Everolimus is an immunosuppressant agent initially developed to prevent transplant rejection and for 
oncology indications. As such, everolimus is associated with a safety and tolerability burden, including 
non-infectious pneumonitis, increased infection risk, hypersensitivity reactions, stomatitis, renal failure, 
impaired wound healing, myelosuppression and metabolic disorders. 
Vigabatrin (VGB) was first licensed as an antiepileptic agent (in the UK and the Republic of Ireland) in 
1989 (as Sabril) and was most recently approved in the EU in 2018 (as Kigabeq) to treat infantile 
spasms, and is often used for treatment of infantile spasms secondary to TSC. Vigabatrin is typically 
recommended as a first-line treatment for TSC-related spasms or focal seizures in children < 1 year of 
age in Europe. 
Corticotropin (ACTH) or other corticosteroids have been demonstrated as effective in the treatment of 
infantile spasms. ACTH treatment is associated with serious AEs, including fulminant infections secondary 
to immunosuppression, hypertension, glucosuria and metabolic abnormalities and may contribute to 
enlargement of cardiac rhabdomyoma in TSC patients. Thus, corticosteroid therapy is generally short-
term (approximately 2 weeks followed by taper), and close monitoring is required in TSC patients with 
cardiac rhabdomyoma. 
Utilisation of Clobazam (CLB) is estimated to be limited to < 20% of the 46,000 patients with TSC in the 
EU. Benzodiazepines such as CLB are not commonly used for treating seizures associated with TSC, and 
guidelines do not support utilisation. Data on effectiveness of CLB on focal seizures are limited, and there 
are no dosing recommendations to guide initiation, titration, and target dosing of CLB for the treatment of 
seizures associated with TSC in children aged < 6 years old. While CLB may be a useful add-on 
medication for some with refractory epilepsy, its clinical use may be limited by the side effects on 
behaviour (severe aggressive outbursts, hyperactivity, insomnia, and depression with suicidal ideation), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 108/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which are important comorbidities in some patients with TSC. Additionally, CLB is associated with adverse 
reactions including somnolence, sedation, cognitive impairment, respiratory depression, tolerance, and 
dependence. 
There is therefore an unmet medical need for new efficacious and safe pharmaceutical treatments for 
refractory seizures in TSC. Despite the currently available treatment options, many patients with TSC-
associated epilepsy continue to have seizures: more than 60% of patients do not achieve seizure control 
despite the availability of multiple AEDs and non-pharmacological interventions. Current AEDs are often 
associated with side effects, which can be worsened by polypharmacy. As with any refractory epilepsy, 
physicians typically try several AEDs in order to gain epilepsy control. However, such polypharmacy often 
leads to a high burden of adverse events (AEs), and the appropriate balance of tolerability and efficacy is 
critical to achieving seizure control.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS in TSC comprises a single, Phase III, 
randomised, placebo-controlled trial (GWEP1521) that investigated 25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS for the treatment of TSC-associated seizures. The trial design was similar to that used for the 
CBD-OS trials in other indications. The GWEP1521 trial consisted of a 4-week baseline period, followed by 
a 16-week treatment period comprising a 4-week titration (dose escalation) period and a 12-week 
maintenance (stable dosing) period. Patients who completed the double-blind phase could transition to 
the OLE phase of the trial where all patients were titrated to 25 mg/kg/day CBD-OS; the dose could then 
be increased up to 50 mg/kg/day if required for better seizure control or decreased if the patient 
experienced intolerance.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary analysis demonstrated greater reduction in TSC-associated seizures in the active treatment 
groups as compared with the placebo group. The median change in number of TSC-associated seizures 
during the treatment period for 25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, and placebo were -43.36, -36.55, and -
20.08, respectively. Thus, the percent decrease in TSC-associated seizure frequency was 48.6% in the 25 
mg/kg/day group and 26.5% in the placebo group compared to their baseline. The primary endpoint 
(change from baseline in TSC-associated seizures for the 25 mg/kg/day dosage group) was statistically 
significant (treatment ratio 0.699, 95% CI: 0.567, 0.861; p=0.0009), demonstrating the efficacy of 
Epidyolex in patients with TSC. A similar pattern was seen for the percent decrease in total seizures for 
patients who received CBD-OS compared to placebo (treatment ratio 0.709, 95% CI: 0.576-0.873; 
p=0.0013). The proportion of patients with any improvement in overall condition on Global Impression of 
Change Score (slightly improved, much improved, or very much improved) at their last visit for patients 
with caregiver and/or subject data available was higher in the 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group (68.6%) 
and 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group (62.3%) compared with the placebo group (39.5%).  
The change from baseline in TSC-associated seizure free days per 28 days was greater in both the 25 
mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P groups compared to placebo. 
To account for differences in sample size with increasing time, maintenance of efficacy was assessed in 
patients treated for > 52 weeks in the Interim Expanded Access Program. The median percentage 
reduction in convulsive seizure frequency from Week 15 onwards was 43.9%, which was maintained to 
Week 53 onwards (median 52.5% reduction).

EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 109/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint is not fully in line with recommendation given in the EU Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders, according to which “Two 
important variables should be specified in the protocol. The primary endpoint should be responders/non-
responders, where responders are patients who obtained at least a certain pre-defined percentage 
reduction of seizure frequency (e.g. a 50% reduction is commonly used). The other variable should be 
some parameterisation using the actual change in seizure frequency.” Nonetheless, the use of 50% 
responder rate as a key secondary endpoint instead of primary endpoint was accepted by PDCO and 
included in the agreed PIP. 
The efficacy of the 50 mg/kg/day dose was found to be similar to that of the 25 mg/kg/day dose; 
however, the safety and tolerability burden is greater with the 50 mg/kg/day dose. Only the 25 
mg/kg/day dose of Epidyolex has been submitted for approval. 
There is no evidence of efficacy available for the lower dose level of 10 mg/kg/day and the similar efficacy 
profile of 50 mg/kg/day dose to 25 mg/kg/day dose is precluding establishment of a dose-response 
relationship or low or high doses to be approved or used for treatment of TSC. 
As also observed with studies in other indications, the treatment ratio in the subgroup of patients on 
clobazam was 0.534 (95% CI 0.356, 0.800) suggesting a treatment effect twice as large in patients on 
clobazam in comparison to 0.753 (0.589-0.963) in the subgroup of patients not on clobazam in the 
subgroup analysis of primary endpoint. Concomitant administration of cannabidiol and CLB causes an 
approximate 3-fold elevation in the active metabolite N-CLB with little or no increase in CLB likely 
mediated by CYP2C19 inhibition. Literature indicate that both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
interactions between CBD and clobazam that may contribute to its efficacy in Dravet syndrome. 
Nevertheless, in study GWEP1521, 73% of patients did not receive CLB (in contrast to 36% in clinical 
trials with Dravet syndrome) and the results from this subgroup still reached nominal statistical 
significance. Thus, the apparent clinical efficacy observed in the primary analysis does not appear only to 
be driven by interaction with clobazam although it is a factor. 
Clinical efficacy of the 25 mg/kg/day dose was not fully supported by the most important key secondary 
analysis, the 50% responder analysis, where the OR for achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in TSC-associated 
seizure frequency did not reach statistical significance for the 25 mg/kg/day group (P=0.0692). This is 
still considered supportive as these results are in accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
Guideline on Multiplicity Issues in Clinical Trials (EMA/CHMP/44762/2017): “In a situation in which the 
primary endpoint establishes a statistically significant effect, “the results of the ‘responder’ analysis need 
not be statistically significant, but the difference in the proportions of responders should support a 
statement that the investigated treatment induces clinically relevant effects.” Actually, 16.0% of patients 
in the 25 mg/kg/day Epidyolex group achieved the ≥ 75% response level, compared to no patients in the 
placebo group (nominal p=0.0003). 
In addition, data to support PK, efficacy and safety in children below 2 years of age are limited. The 
indication is therefore for children age 2 years and older. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There is a dose related increase in the incidences of TEAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation, 
serious TEAEs, and these groups had same trend for TEAEs being considered treatment related by the 
investigator. Diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and somnolence were the 3 most frequently occurring TEAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021 
Page 110/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and showed higher frequency in higher dose group. Pyrexia, constipation, GGT increased, and cough were 
more common in the 25 mg/kg/day CBD OS group. Liver enzyme increases, pyrexia and vomiting had 
more significant signal and higher incidence in the TSC trial compared to Pool LGS/DS. 
Treatment-emergent AEs of diarrhoea were far more common in the TSC population than in the LGS/DS 
population (CBD-OS treated 30.7%-56.2 vs. 12.9%-21.2%, placebo 25.0% vs 9.6 %).  
In Pool TSC, a greater proportion of CBD-OS patients met criteria for decreases in weight from baseline, 
whereas a greater proportion of placebo patients met criteria for weight increases from baseline, and the 
relative risk of weight loss was higher in the TSC population than in the LGS/DS population.  
Somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, or sedation are very common dose related AE occurring in 27.7% of CBD-
OS treated population in comparison to 13 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group, with more patients in 
the All CBD-OS group, having an AESI of somnolence, fatigue, lethargy, or sedation considered related to 
treatment, a serious TEAE; and 2 a TEAE leading to discontinuation.  
A comparison of the safety profiles in patients treated with or without concomitant CLB reveals that there 
is an increased risk for certain AEs and SAEs in the patient population treated with CLB, including 
somnolence, sedation, lethargy, and pneumonia. 
CBD-OS caused dose-dependent elevations in serum ALT-AST in TSC patients, including some elevations 
meeting the consensus criteria for drug-induced liver injury. There was no clear increased risk associated 
with concomitant use of AEDs other than VPA. 
Generalized maculopapular rash is very common dose related AE occurring in 9.5% of all CBD-OS 
patients, some leading to discontinuation of treatment. Increased number of temporary or permanent 
dose reductions, discontinuation due to TEAEs, and discontinuations due to treatment related TEAEs were 
observed with TSC patients, especially in higher dose group compared to LGS/DS experience in clinical 
trials. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of all TSC patients exposed to 25 mg/kg/day (targeted treatment dose) for 16 weeks in the 
clinical program is 75 while there are no patients exposed to 10 mg/kg/day dose. The number of patients 
followed up in the OLE TSC is 199 patients, 156 of these patients were on 25 mg/kg/day.  
Across the disease populations, the use of > 4 AEDs was associated with increased incidences of serious 
TEAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, as well as with somnolence-related AESIs. Valproic acid and 
VGB were the most commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs. Interaction of CBD-OS with everolimus, the 
only therapy approved for TSC, is unknown.  
Only patients in Pool TSC had at least 1 AESI of significant cardiovascular disease, including severe and 
serious events. Relationship of significant cardiovascular disease to CBD-OD treatment in TSC patients is 
uncertain. 
The  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  was  reported  in  25  mg/kg/day  group  (21,3%)  than  in  50  mg/kg/group 
(13,7%), which is unexpected. The SOC with the most frequently reported SAEs included Investigations, 
Infections and infestations and Nervous system disorders, which is in line with the results obtained from 
previous studies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is a significant unmet medical need for new therapies in TSC and the patients randomised in Study 
GWEP1521 are representative of the highly refractory patient population.  
In the single pivotal study submitted to support the application, CBD-OS 25 mg/kg/day reduced TCS-
associated seizures by 40 % compared to 20 % in the placebo group. The key secondary endpoint (≥ 50 
% reduction in TSC associated seizures) narrowly missed statistical significance (p=0.0692) but 
nevertheless supports a conclusion of efficacy of CBD-OS. In TSC, the proposed maximum recommended 
dose is 25 mg/kg/day, compared to 20 mg/kg/day for other indications, and no dose-response 
relationship has been established.  
CBD-OS is proposed to be indicated as adjunctive treatment in TSC and has been investigated on top of 
other AEDs. A higher efficacy is seen with concomitant clobazam treatment, which can be explained by 
the known pharmacokinetic interaction between CBD and clobazam resulting in an increase in the active 
metabolite N-desmethylclobazam as also observed in studies in other indications. However, albeit less 
robust, the treatment effect of CBD-OS was still statistically significant and is considered clinically 
relevant without concomitant clobazam therapy in this difficult-to-treat TSC patient population. Clobazam 
use in TSC is limited. Utilisation of CLB is estimated to be < 20% of the 46,000 patients with TSC in the 
EU and only 27% of the patients in Study GWEP1521 were treated with clobazam. Data on effectiveness 
of CLB on focal seizures are limited, and there are no dosing recommendations to guide initiation, 
titration, and target dosing of CLB for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC in children aged < 6 
years old. Its clinical use may also be limited by the side effects on behaviour (severe aggressive 
outbursts, hyperactivity, insomnia, and depression with suicidal ideation), which are important 
comorbidities in some patients with TSC. Additionally, CLB is associated with adverse reactions including 
somnolence, sedation, cognitive impairment, respiratory depression, tolerance and dependence. A 
comparison of the safety profiles in patients treated with or without concomitant CLB in Study GWEP1521 
reveals that there is an increased risk for certain AEs and SAEs like somnolence, sedation, lethargy, and 
pneumonia in the patient population treated with CLB.  
In addition, if such a ‘heterogeneity’ is observed between subgroups, the requirement is that the 
magnitude of the estimated effects must be set in the context of a benefit-risk consideration for the 
subgroups (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013).  
The CHMP therefore agrees that the decision to combine cannabidiol with CLB in patients with TSC 
associated seizures should be left to the treating physician.  
Considering that the data to support PK, efficacy and safety in children below 2 years of age are limited, 
the indication is agreed for children age 2 years and older. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of CBD-OS in TSC is demonstrated with the proposed dose level of up to 25 mg/kg/day and is 
reasonably supported by the key secondary endpoint.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Epidyolex is positive for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC) for patients 2 years of age and older. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis 
complex (TSC) for patients 2 years of age and older. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 
5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The updated RMP 
version 2.0 is agreed. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to correct typographic errors and implement editorial updates as well 
as implement the updated ethanol statement in compliance with the EC Guideline on Excipient. In 
addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of Sweden. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0047/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Epidyolex is not similar to Votubia within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/168137/2021

Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

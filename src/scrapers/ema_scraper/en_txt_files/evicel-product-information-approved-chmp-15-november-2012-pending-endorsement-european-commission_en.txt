PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solutions for sealant. 
Clear or slightly opalescent solutions. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
EVICEL is used as supportive treatment in surgery where standard surgical techniques are insufficient, for 
improvement of haemostasis (see Section 5.1). 
EVICEL is also indicated as suture support for haemostasis in vascular surgery. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of EVICEL is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of EVICEL 
Posology 
The volume of EVICEL to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented towards 
the underlying clinical needs of the patient. 
The dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgical 
intervention, the size of the area and the mode of intended application and the number of applications. 
Application of the product must be individualised by the treating physician. In clinical trials in vascular 
surgery, the individual dosage used was up to 4 ml, whereas in retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal surgery the 
individual dosage used was up to 10 ml. However, for some procedures (e.g. liver traumata) larger volumes 
may be required. 
The initial volume of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should be 
sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area. The application can be repeated, if necessary.

Method and route of administration 
For epilesional use. 
To avoid the risk of potentially life threatening air embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using pressurised 
CO2 gas only. 
Prior to applying EVICEL the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. 
intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices).  
The product should only be reconstituted and administered according to the instructions and with the devices 
recommended for this product.  
See Sections 4.4 and 6.6 for specific spray recommendations on the required pressure and distance from 
tissue per surgical procedure and length of application tip. 
4.3  Contraindications 
EVICEL must not be applied intravascularly. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. 
Spray application of EVICEL should not be used in endoscopic procedures. For laparoscopy, see Section 4.4. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
For epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly.  
Life  threatening  thromboembolic  complications  may  occur  if  the  product  is  unintentionally  applied 
intravascularly. 
Life threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator 
to administer EVICEL.EVICEL should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively 
interfere with the product’s efficacy and the wound healing process. 
Air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator to administer 
EVICEL.  This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended 
pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface.   
EVICEL spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, 
especially during laparoscopy. Spray distance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges 
recommended by the manufacturer (see table in Section 6.6 for pressure and distance).   
When spraying EVICEL, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be 
monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism.  
When using accessory tips with this product, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed. 
EVICEL should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the 
product’s efficacy and the wound healing process 
Adequate data are not available to support the use of this product in tissue gluing, neurosurgery, application 
through an endoscope for treatment of bleeding or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. 
Before administration of EVICEL, care is to be taken that parts of the body outside the desired application 
area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites.

As with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity 
reactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. 
If these symptoms occur, the administration should be immediately discontinued. In case of shock, standard 
medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human 
blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific 
markers  of  infection  and  the  inclusion  of  effective  manufacturing  steps  for  the  inactivation/removal  of 
viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility  of  transmitting  infections  agents  cannot  be  totally  excluded.  This  also  applies  to  unknown  or 
emerging viruses and other pathogens.  
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, Hepatitis C Virus and 
Hepatitis B Virus and for the non-enveloped virus Hepatitis A Virus. The measures taken may be of limited 
value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for 
pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoyesis 
(e.g. haemolytic anaemia). 
It is strongly recommended that every time EVICEL is administered to a patient, the name and batch number 
of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal interaction studies have been performed.  
Similar  to  comparable  products  or  thrombin  solutions,  the  product  may  be  denatured  after  exposure  to 
solutions  containing  alcohol,  iodine  or  heavy  metals  (e.g.  antiseptic  solutions).  Such  substances  should  be 
removed to the greatest possible extent before applying the product. 
4.6  Pregnancy and lactation  
The safety of fibrin sealants/haemostatics for use in human pregnancy or during breast-feeding has not been 
established in controlled clinical trials. Experimental animal studies are insufficient to assess the safety with 
respect to reproduction, development of the embryo or foetus, the course of gestation and peri- and post-natal 
development. Therefore, the product should be administered to pregnant and lactating women only if clearly 
needed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Adverse reactions which may be reported in association with fibrin sealants are described below. Since no 
such reactions have been reported during clinical trials with EVICEL, the frequency of these events with 
EVICEL is not known. 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
application site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, 
nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur in rare 
cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants/haemostatics. In isolated cases, these reactions have progressed 
to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or 
administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product. Mild reactions can be 
managed with anti-histamines. Severe hypotensive reactions require immediate intervention using current 
principles of shock therapy. 
Antibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely.

Inadvertent intravascular injection could lead to thromboembolic event and DIC, and there is also a risk of 
anaphylactic reaction (see Section 4.4). 
Life threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator 
to administer EVICEL. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than 
recommended pressures and/or in close proximity to the tissue surface. 
For safety with respect to transmissible agents, see Section 4.4. 
The following adverse events which occurred during clinical studies were evaluated as having a possible 
causal relationship to treatment with EVICEL. The frequency of all of the events listed below was common 
(defined as > 1/100, < 1/10).

Adverse Reaction Rates in Retroperitoneal or Intra-Abdominal Surgery Study 
Among 135 patients undergoing retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal surgery (67 patients treated with 
EVICEL and 68 controls), no adverse events were considered to be causally related to the study treatment 
according to the investigator assessments. However, 3 serious adverse events (SAE) (one abdominal abscess 
in the EVICEL group and one abdominal and one pelvic abscess in the control group) were considered by 
the Sponsor to be possibly related to study treatment. 
Adverse Reactions - Vascular Surgery  
In a controlled study involving 147 patients undergoing vascular grafting procedures (75 treated with 
EVICEL and 72 controls), a total of 16 subjects were reported to have had a graft thrombosis/occlusion 
adverse event during the study period. The events were evenly distributed across treatment arms, with 8 each 
in the EVICEL and the control groups.  
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: local haemostatics, ATC code: B02BC 
The fibrin adhesion system initiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Conversion of 
fibrinogen into fibrin occurs by the splitting of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and fibrinopeptides. The 
fibrin monomers aggregate and form a fibrin clot. Factor XIIIa, which is activated form Factor XIII by 
thrombin, crosslinks fibrin. Calcium ions are required for both, the conversion of fibrinogen and the 
crosslinkage of fibrin. As wound healing progresses, increased fibrinolytic activity is induced by plasmin and 
decomposition of fibrin to fibrin degradation products is initiated. 
Clinical studies demonstrating haemostasis and suture support were conducted in a total of 147 patients (75 
with EVICEL, 72 with control) undergoing vascular surgery with PTFE grafts and in a total of 135 patients 
(66 with EVICEL, 69 with control) undergoing retroperitoneal and intra-abdominal surgery. 
Data  are  too  limited  to  support  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  EVICEL  in  children.  Of  135  patients 
undergoing  retroperitoneal  and  intra-abdominal  surgery  who  were  included  in  the  controlled  study  of 
EVICEL, 4 patients treated with EVICEL were aged 16 years or younger. Of these, 2 were children aged 2 
and  5  years  and  2  were  adolescents  of  16  years.  No  data  are  currently  available  for  ages  younger  than  2 
years. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
EVICEL is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. As a 
consequence, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man. 
Studies have been conducted in rabbits to evaluate the absorption and elimination of thrombin when applied 
to the cut surface of the liver resulting from partial hepatectomy. Using 125I-thrombin it was shown that a 
slow absorption of biologically inactive peptides resulting from the breakdown of thrombin occurred, 
reaching a Cmax in the plasma after 6-8 hours. At the Cmax, the plasma concentration represented only 1-2 % 
of the applied dose.  
Fibrin sealants/haemostatics are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin, by fibrinolysis and 
phagocytosis. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Studies performed in bacteria to determine mutagenicity were negative for Thrombin alone, Biological 
Active Component (containing fibrinogen, citrate, glycine, tranexamic acid, and arginine hydrochloride), 
TnBP alone, and Triton X-100 alone at all concentrations tested. All concentrations of the combination of 
TnBP and Triton X-100 also tested negative in assays performed to determine mammalian cell 
mutageneicity, chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei induction. 
After local application, absorption of thrombin into the plasma is slow and consists principally of thrombin 
degradation products which are eliminated. 
No  toxicological  effects  due  to  the  solvent  detergent  reagents  (TnBP  and  Triton  X-100)  used  in  the  virus 
inactivation procedure are expected since the residual levels are less than 5 µg/ml. 
Neurotoxicity studies performed with EVICEL confirmed that subdural administration in the rabbit was not 
associated  with  any  evidence  of  neurotoxicity.  Neurobehavioral  observations  for  14±1  days  showed  no 
abnormal findings. No major macroscopic signs of local intolerance and no treatment – related macroscopic 
findings were observed. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid did not reveal major signs of inflammation.

 
Thawing: 
The vials should be thawed in one of the following ways: 
2-8°C (refrigerator): vials thaw within 1 day, or 
20-25°C (room temperature): vials thaw within 1 hour, or 
37ºC  (e.g.  water  bath,  using  aseptic  technique,  or  by  warming  vials  in  the  hand):  vials  should  be  thawed 
within 10 minutes and must not be left at this temperature for longer than 10 minutes or until fully thawed. 
The temperature must not exceed 37ºC. 
Before use, the product must reach 20-30°C. 
 
Preparation  
The solutions are clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. 
EVICEL should only be applied using the CE-marked EVICEL application device and optional use of a tip 
accessory  to  the  device.  Leaflets  giving  detailed  instructions  for  use  of  EVICEL  in  conjunction  with  the 
application device and optional accessory are provided with the package of the application device and of the 
accessory.  The  accessory  tips  should  only  be  used  by  persons  adequately  trained  in  laparoscopic, 
laparoscopic assisted or open surgical procedures. 
Draw the contents of the two vials into the application device, following the instructions for use in the device 
package. Both syringes should be filled with equal volumes, and should not contain air bubbles. No needles 
are involved in the preparation of EVICEL for administration. 
 
Application by dripping  
Keeping the tip of the applicator as close to the tissue surface as possible, but without touching the tissue 
during application, apply individual drops to the area to be treated. If the applicator tip becomes blocked, the 
catheter tip can be cut back in 0.5 cm increments.    
 
Spray application  
To avoid the risk of life-threatening air embolism EVICEL should only be sprayed using pressurised CO2 
(see table below). 
Connect the short tube on the application device to the male luer-lock end of the long gas tube. Connect the 
female luer lock of the gas tube (with the 0.2 μm bacteriostatic filter) to a pressure regulator. The pressure 
regulator should be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.  
When applying EVICEL using a spray device, be sure to use a pressure and a distance from the tissue within

Further information 
1.  WHAT EVICEL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
EVICEL is a Human Fibrin Sealant which is supplied as a package containing two separate vials, each 
containing 1 ml, 2 ml or 5 ml of solution (Fibrinogen and Thrombin respectively) Human Fibrinogen and 
Human Thrombin.  
An application device and appropriate accessory tips are supplied separately. 
Fibrinogen is a concentrate of clottable protein and Thrombin is an enzyme that causes clottable protein to 
coalesce. Thus, when the two components are mixed together they clot instantly. 
EVICEL is applied during surgical operations, to reduce bleeding and oozing during and after the operation. 
It is dripped or sprayed onto cut tissue where it forms a thin layer that seals the tissue and stops bleeding. 
EVICEL can also be used in blood vessels surgery and in surgery taking place in the area between the 
bowels and the posterior abdominal wall.  
2. 
BEFORE YOU ARE TREATED WITH EVICEL 
Do not use EVICEL 
• 
If  you  are  hypersensitive  (allergic)  to  products  made  from  human  blood  or  to  any  of  the  other 
ingredients  of  EVICEL.  Signs  of  such  reactions include  hives,  rash,  tightness  of  the  chest,  wheezing, 
drop in blood pressure and breathing difficulties. If these symptoms occur, the administration has to be 
discontinued immediately. 
•  EVICEL should not be used in endoscopic surgery. For laparoscopy, see recommendations below. 
Take special care with EVICEL 
• 
• 
the  risk  of  potentially  fatal  air  embolism  EVICEL  should  be  sprayed  using 
To  avoid 
pressurised CO2 gas only. 
Prior to applying EVICEL, the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques (e.g. 
intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  When  EVICEL  is  applied  during  surgery,  the  surgeon  must  ensure  that  it  is  only  applied  onto  the 
surface of tissue. EVICEL must not be injected into tissue or blood vessels because it would cause clots 
which could be fatal.  
The  use  of  EVICEL  has  not  been  studied  in  the  following  procedures,  and  there  is  therefore  no 
information to show that it would be effective: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
gluing tissues together 
surgery to the brain or spinal cord 
controlling bleeding in the stomach or intestines by applying the product through an endoscope 
(tube) 
sealing surgical repairs to the intestines. 
• 
EVICEL  will  be  applied  as  a  thin  layer.  Excessive  clot  thickness  may  negatively  interfere  with  the 
product’s efficacy and the wound healing process. 
Life-threatening air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator 
to  administer  EVICEL.  This  event  appears  to  be  related  to  the  use  of  the  spray  device  at  higher  than 
recommended  pressures  and/or  in  close  proximity  to  the  tissue  surface.  EVICEL  spray  application  should 
only  be  used  if  it  is  possible  to  accurately  judge  the  spray  distance,  especially  during  laparoscopy.  Spray 
distance from tissue and pressure should be within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer (see table 
in  Section  Instructions  for  Use).    When  spraying  EVICEL,  changes  in  blood  pressure,  pulse,  oxygen 
saturation  and  end  tidal  CO2  should  be  monitored  because  of  the  possibility  of  occurrence  of  air  or  gas 
embolism. Spray devices and accessory tips provide instructions for use with recommendations for pressure 
ranges and proximity to tissue surface, which should be carefully followed.  
•  Nearby areas should be protected to make sure that EVICEL is only applied onto the surface which is to 
be treated. 
•  As with any product containing proteins, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of 
such  reactions  include  hives,  rash,  tightness  of  the  chest,  wheezing,  drop  in  blood  pressure  and 
anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration has to be discontinued immediately. 
•  When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put into place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to 
make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of 
plasma for signs of viruses/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the 
processing of the blood and plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when 
medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses, or other 
types of infections. 
The measures taken in the manufacture of Fibrinogen and Thrombin are considered effective for lipid coated 
viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus and the non-
enveloped virus, hepatitis A. The measures taken may be of limited value against parvovirus B19. Parvovirus 
B19  infection  may  be  serious  for  pregnant  women  (foetal  infection)  and  for  individuals  whose  immune 
system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). 
The  healthcare  professionals  will  record  the  name  and  batch  number  of  the  medicinal  product  in  order  to 
trace any possible infection source. 
Using other medicines 
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even 
those not prescribed. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
There is not enough information available to know whether any particular risks are associated with the use of 
EVICEL  during  pregnancy  or  whilst  breast-feeding.  However,  since  EVICEL  is  used  during  a  surgical 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
operation,  if  you  are  pregnant  or  breast-feeding  you  should  discuss  the  overall  risks  of  the  operation  with 
your doctor. 
Pediatric use 
Data are too limited to support the safety and effectiveness of EVICEL in children. 
3.  HOW TO USE EVICEL 
The doctor treating you will administer EVICEL during surgery. During your operation, your doctor will 
drip or spray EVICEL onto raw tissue during operations, using an application device. This device allows 
equal amounts of the two components of EVICEL to be administered at the same time, and ensures that they 
mix evenly, which is important for the sealant to have its optimal effect. 
The amount of EVICEL that will be applied depends on the surface area of tissue to be treated during the 
operation. It will be dripped onto the tissue in very small amounts or sprayed in short bursts (0.1-0.2 ml), to 
produce a thin, even layer. If application of a single layer of EVICEL does not completely stop the bleeding, 
a second layer may be applied. 
4. 
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS 
Like all medicines, EVICEL can have side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
EVICEL is a fibrin sealant.  Fibrin sealants in general may, in rare cases (1 to 10 patients in 10,000), cause 
an  allergic  reaction.   If  you  experience  an  allergic  reaction  you  might  have  one  or  more  of  the  following 
symptoms:  skin  rash,  hives  or  wheals  (nettle-rash),  tightness  of  the  chest,  chills,  flushing,  headache,  low 
blood  pressure,  lethargy,  nausea,  restlessness,  increased  heart  rate,  tingling,  vomiting  or  wheezing.  No 
allergic reactions have so far been reported in patients treated with EVICEL. 
There is also a theoretical possibility that you could develop antibodies to the proteins in EVICEL, which 
could potentially interfere with blood clotting.  
If  you  feel  unwell  tell  your  doctor  immediately,  even  if  your  symptoms  are  different  from  those  just 
described.  
If you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. 
In clinical studies with EVICEL some undesired events occurred for which a causal relation to the 
application of EVICEL could not be excluded. After abdominal surgery some patients presented with an 
abscess, and in vascular surgery some cases of an occluded graft occurred which had do be re-operated. 
5. 
HOW TO STORE EVICEL

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only. 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
Read this before you open the package 
EVICEL comes in sterile packages and therefore it is important to use only undamaged packages which have 
not been opened (post-sterilisation is not possible). 
Preparation 
No needles are involved in the preparation of EVICEL for administration. Draw the contents of the two vials 
into the administration device following the instructions for use in the device package. Both syringes should 
be  filled  with  equal  volumes,  and  should  not  contain  air  bubbles.  Any  unused  product  or  waste  material 
should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local  requirements.  The  solutions  should  be  clear  or  slightly 
opalescent. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. 
STORAGE OF EVICEL 
The vials must be stored in an upright position. 
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the carton and label.  
Keep out of reach and sight of children. 
Fibrinogen and Thrombin:  
Long term storage 
Store in a freezer at -18°C or colder. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the carton. 
Short term storage 
Store at  2°C-8°C  (in  a  refrigerator) for  no  more  than  25 days.  The  date  on  which  refrigerator  storage  was 
started should be marked on the carton in the space provided. Do not re-freeze. 
Fibrinogen and Thrombin are stable at room temperature for 24 hours but when they have been drawn up 
into the administration device, they must be used immediately.  
Application Device:  
Store separately from the Fibrinogen and Thrombin, at room temperature. 
 
Thawing 
The vials should be thawed in one of the following ways: 
2-8°C (refrigerator): vials thaw within 1 day, or 
20-25°C (room temperature): vials thaw within 1 hour, or 
37ºC  (e.g.  water  bath,  using  aseptic  technique,  or  by  warming  vials  in  the  hand):  vials  should  be  thawed 
within 10 minutes and must not be left at this temperature for longer than 10 minutes or until fully thawed. 
The temperature must not exceed 37ºC. 
Before use, the product must reach 20-30°C. 
 
Preparation  
The solutions are clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. 
EVICEL  should  be  applied  using  the  CE-marked  EVICEL  application  device  and  optional  use  of  a  tip 
accessory  to  the  device.  Leaflets  giving  detailed  instructions  for  use  of  EVICEL  in  conjunction  with  the 
application device and optional accessory are provided with the package of the application device and of the 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accessory.  The  accessory  tips  should  only  be  used  by  persons  adequately  trained  in  laparoscopic, 
laparoscopic assisted or open surgical procedures. The product should only be reconstituted and administered 
according to the instructions and with the devices recommended for this product.  
To avoid the risk of potentially life threatening air embolism EVICEL should be sprayed using pressurised 
CO2 only. 
Draw the contents of the two vials into the application device, following the instructions for use in the device 
package. Both syringes should be filled with equal volumes, and should not contain air bubbles. No needles 
are involved in the preparation of EVICEL for administration. 
Prior  to  applying  EVICEL  the  surface  area  of  the  wound  needs  to  be  dried  by  standard  techniques  (e.g. 
intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). 
 
Application by dripping  
Keeping the tip of the applicator as close to the tissue surface as possible, but without touching the tissue 
during application, apply individual drops to the area to be treated. If the applicator tip becomes blocked, the 
catheter tip can be cut back in 0.5 cm increments.    
 
Spray application  
EVICEL must be sprayed using pressurised CO2 only. 
Connect the short tube on the application device to the male luer-lock end of the long gas tube. Connect the 
female luer lock of the gas tube (with the 0.2 μm bacteriostatic filter) to a pressure regulator. The pressure 
regulator should be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.  
When applying EVICEL using a spray device, be sure to use a pressure and a distance from tissue within the 
ranges recommended by the manufacturer:

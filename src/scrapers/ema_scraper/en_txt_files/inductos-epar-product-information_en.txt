CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
InductOs is indicated for single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion as a substitute for autogenous 
bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least 6 months of non-operative 
treatment for this condition.  
InductOs is indicated for the treatment of acute tibia fractures in adults, as an adjunct to standard care 
using open fracture reduction and intramedullary unreamed nail fixation. 
See section 5.1.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
InductOs should be used by an appropriately qualified surgeon. 
Posology  
InductOs must be prepared exactly in accordance with the directions for preparation (see section 6.6). 
The appropriate dose is determined by the volume of wetted matrix required for the intended 
indication. 
If the surgical setting requires that only a portion of the product is needed, the wetted matrix should be 
cut to the desired size, and the unused portion must be discarded.

Lumbar interbody fusion surgery 
The required volume of InductOs is determined by the intervertebral disc space and the size, shape, 
and internal volume of the lumbar interbody fusion device(s) being used. Care must be taken not to 
compress the product or overfill the volume intended for new bone formation (see section 4.4). 
Typically, 4 mg (2.7 cm3 of wetted matrix) of InductOs is used in the intervertebral disc space. The 
maximum dosage is limited to 8 mg (5.3 cm3 of wetted matrix) of InductOs in the intervertebral disc 
space. InductOs must be placed within the lumbar interbody fusion device(s) or in the anterior portion 
of the intervertebral disc space. 
Acute tibia fracture surgery 
The volume of InductOs to be implanted is determined by the fracture anatomy and the ability to close 
the wound without overly packing or compressing the product. Generally, each fracture site is treated 
with the contents of one 12 mg pack. The maximum dosage is limited to 24 mg (2 entire 12 mg pack 
matrices). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of InductOs in children below 18 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
The medicinal product is administered by implantation. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
Failure to follow the method of administration of InductOs may compromise its safety and efficacy.  
Forceps should be used to handle InductOs. During handling and implantation, minimize fluid loss 
from the matrix. Do not squeeze.

Lumbar interbody fusion surgery  
InductOs must not be used alone for this indication, but should be used with an approved (CE-marked) 
lumbar interbody fusion device(s). Compatibility has been demonstrated with titanium, 
polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and allograft bone. 
Care and caution must be used to prevent overfilling the lumbar interbody fusion device and/or the 
anterior portion of the intervertebral disc space (see section 4.4). 
Pre-Implantation 
4 mg pack: 
The matrix is pre-cut in 2 pieces each of 2.5 x 5 cm. 
12 mg pack: 
The matrix is in 1 piece of 7.5 cm x 10 cm. The wetted matrix should be cut into 6 equal pieces 
(approximately 2.5 x 5 cm) as an aid for dose selection. The selected pieces can be further cut as 
required. 
The hollow geometry of the lumbar interbody fusion device must be carefully and loosely filled with 
the volume of InductOs corresponding to the internal volume of the device. 
Implantation 
As per standard practice, disc material and the cartilaginous portions of the vertebral endplates should 
be removed, preserving the cortical portions of the endplates, and haemostasis should be achieved (see 
section 4.5). 
For instructions to implant the lumbar interbody fusion device, please refer to the manufacturer’s 
instructions for use.  
InductOs must not be implanted posterior to the lumbar interbody fusion device where direct access to 
the spinal canal and/or nerve root(s) is possible. If leakage into the spinal canal and the nerve root is 
possible, a physical barrier between the matrix and any neurological tissue must be re-created by 
using, for example, local bone or allograft (see section 4.5).   
Post-Implantation  
Once InductOs and the lumbar interbody fusion device(s) are implanted, the inside of the 
intervertebral disc space must not be irrigated. Outside the intervertebral disc space, the surgical field 
should be irrigated as needed, and any fluid loss from the wetted matrix should be washed away. 
If a surgical drain is required, the drain should be placed remotely from the implantation site or, 
preferably, one layer superficial to the implantation site. 
Acute tibia fracture surgery 
Pre-Implantation 
Definitive fracture reduction, fixation, and haemostasis should be achieved prior to InductOs 
implantation. 
InductOs should be folded or cut as needed prior to implantation.  
Implantation 
InductOs is implanted after the completion of standard fracture and wound management (i.e. at the 
time of soft-tissue closure).  
To the extent possible, the accessible surface area of the fracture (fracture lines and defects) should be 
covered with InductOs. InductOs should be placed bridging the fracture region and making good 
contact with the major proximal and distal fragments. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
InductOs may be placed into a void (loosely packed), folded, rolled or wrapped, as the geometry of the 
fracture requires. InductOs does not provide mechanical stability and should not be used to fill a void 
in the presence of compressive forces. 
Post-Implantation 
Once InductOs is implanted, do not irrigate the wound. 
If a surgical drain is required, the drain should be placed remotely from the implantation site or, 
preferably, one layer superficially to the implantation site. 
To achieve maximum potential efficacy, it is important to attain complete soft-tissue coverage of 
InductOs following its implantation. 
4.3  Contraindications 
InductOs is contraindicated for patients with: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Skeletal immaturity 
Any active malignancy or patient undergoing treatment for a malignancy  
An active infection at the operative site 
Persistent compartment syndrome or neurovascular residua of compartment syndrome 
Pathological fractures such as those observed in (but not limited to) Paget’s disease or in 
metastatic bone 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Failure to follow the product preparation instructions in section 6.6 and the method of administration 
in section 4.2 may compromise the safety and efficacy of InductOs. 
Cervical spine surgery 
The safety and efficacy of InductOs in cervical spine surgery have not been established, and InductOs 
should not be used in this condition. Localised oedema associated with the use of InductOs has been 
reported in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery. The oedema was delayed in onset and usually 
occurred in the first week post-operation. In some cases, the oedema was severe enough to result in 
airway compromise. 
Malignancy 
InductOs should not be used in patients with history or clinical suspicion of malignancy at the site of 
application (see section 4.3). 
Heterotopic ossification 
Use of InductOs may cause heterotopic ossification at the site of implantation and/or the surrounding 
tissues, which may result in complications. 
Bone resorption increased 
InductOs can cause initial resorption of surrounding trabecular bone as evidenced by radiolucency. 
Therefore, in the absence of clinical data, the product should not be used for direct applications to 
trabecular bone where transient bone resorption may create a risk of bone fragility (see section 4.8). 
Fluid collections 
Formation of a fluid collection (pseudocyst, localised oedema, implant site effusion), sometimes 
encapsulated and in some cases resulting in nerve compression and pain, has been reported associated 
with the use of InductOs. Clinical intervention (aspiration and/or surgical removal) may be required if 
symptoms persist (see section 4.8). 
Immune response 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both dibotermin alfa and bovine Type I collagen have been found to elicit immune responses in 
patients.  
Anti-dibotermin alfa antibodies: In spine fusion studies, 1.3% of patients receiving InductOs 
developed antibodies to dibotermin alfa versus 0.8% of patients receiving autogenous bone graft. In 
long-bone fracture studies, 6.3% of patients receiving dibotermin alfa with bovine Type I collagen 
matrix developed antibodies to dibotermin alfa versus 1.3% in the control group. All patients who 
were tested for neutralizing antibodies to bone morphogenetic protein-2 were negative. 
Anti-bovine Type I collagen antibodies: In spine fusion studies, 13.5% of patients receiving InductOs 
developed antibodies to bovine Type I collagen versus 14.3% of patients receiving autogenous bone 
graft. In long-bone fracture studies, 13.0% of patients receiving dibotermin alfa with bovine Type I 
collagen matrix developed antibodies to bovine Type I collagen versus 5.3% of control patients. None 
of the patients with positive titers to bovine Type I collagen had cross-reacting antibodies to human 
type I collagen. 
Although no association with clinical outcome or undesirable effects could be observed in clinical 
studies, the possibility of developing neutralising antibodies or hypersensitivity-type reactions cannot 
be excluded. The possibility of an immune response to the product should be considered in cases 
where an undesirable effect with immunological background is suspected. Special consideration of 
risks and benefits should be given for patients who have previously received injectable collagen (see 
section 4.3). In the absence of any experience, the repeat use of InductOs is not recommended. 
Special populations 
The safety and efficacy of the use of InductOs in patients with known autoimmune disease have not 
been established. These autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis/polymyositis. 
The safety and efficacy of InductOs have not been demonstrated in patients with metabolic bone 
diseases. 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic, renal or cardiac impairment.  
For these special populations, the physician is advised to give a careful consideration to the benefits 
and risks for the specific patient before using InductOs. A close monitoring of the patient for any 
adverse reactions and the success of the treatment is recommended. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per maximum dose (two 12 mg 
packs), i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Special warnings and precautions for use specific to lumbar interbody fusion 
used with interbody fusion devices made from material other than titanium, PEEK or bone  
implanted at locations other than lumbar spine  
used in surgical techniques other than lumbar interbody fusion  
The safety and efficacy of InductOs have not been established in the following conditions:  
• 
• 
• 
To avoid exaggerated pharmacological effects of InductOs, care and caution should be used to prevent 
overfilling the lumbar interbody fusion device and/or the anterior portion of the intervertebral disc 
space. 
Heterotopic ossification 
Bone formation outside the intervertebral disc space is not desirable as it may have a deleterious 
impact on local neurovascular structures.  
In clinical trials when degenerative disc disease was treated by a posterior lumbar interbody fusion 
procedure with dibotermin alfa, posterior bone formation was observed in CT scans. In some cases it 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may lead to nerve compression potentially requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.8). As a 
precaution, a physical barrier between the matrix and any neurological tissue must be re-created (see 
section 4.2). 
Device dislocation 
Device dislocation can occur after the use of InductOs in spinal fusion surgery that may necessitate 
surgical revision (see section 4.8). 
Special warnings and precautions for use specific to acute tibia fractures 
InductOs is intended for use in patients with the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
adequate fracture reduction and stabilization to ensure mechanical stability 
adequate neurovascular status (e.g. absence of compartment syndrome, low risk of amputation) 
adequate haemostasis (i.e., providing a relatively dry implantation site) 
absence of large segmental defect repair of long bones, in which significant soft tissue 
compression can occur 
The implant may only be administered to the fracture site under adequate vision and with utmost care 
(see section 4.2). 
Efficacy information in tibia fracture is available only from controlled clinical trials in which open 
tibial fractures were treated using intramedullary nail fixation (see section 5.1). In a clinical study in 
which the intramedullary canal was reamed to cortical chatter, an increased rate of infection was 
observed in the InductOs-treated group versus the standard of care control group (see section 4.8). The 
use of InductOs with reamed nails in open tibial fracture repair is not recommended. 
InductOs does not provide mechanical stability and should not be used to fill a void in the presence of 
compressive forces. Long-bone fracture and soft-tissue management procedures should be based on 
standard practice, including control of infection. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
As dibotermin alfa is a protein and has not been identified in the general circulation, it is an unlikely 
candidate for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. 
In acute tibia fracture clinical trials, more InductOs patients receiving concomitant NSAIDs for 14 
consecutive days experienced mild or moderate adverse events related to wound healing (e.g., wound 
drainage) than InductOs patients not taking NSAIDs. Although patient outcome was not affected, an 
interaction between NSAIDs and InductOs cannot be excluded. 
Information from clinical studies in acute tibia fractures indicated that the use of InductOs in patients 
receiving glucocorticoids was not associated with any apparent adverse reactions. In non-clinical 
studies, concurrent administration of glucocorticoids depressed bone repair (measured as a % change 
from control), but the effects of InductOs were not altered.  
In an in vitro study, dibotermin alfa was shown to bind to fibrin-based haemostatic agents or sealants. 
The use of these products in close proximity to InductOs is not recommended as this may lead to bone 
formation at the site of implant of the fibrin-based haemostatic agent or sealant (see section 4.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of dibotermin alfa in pregnant women.  
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Due to the unknown risks to the foetus associated with the potential development of neutralising 
antibodies to dibotermin alfa, InductOs is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
There is no information on the excretion of dibotermin alfa/metabolites in human milk. Considering 
the type of product, systemic exposure of the suckling infant is not expected, however a risk to the 
newborn/infant cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from InductOs therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No impact on fertility was detected in non-clinical studies. No clinical data are available; potential risk 
for human is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
InductOs has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions for InductOs in lumbar interbody fusion surgery were 
radiculopathic events, and in acute tibia fracture surgery it was localised infection. The most severe 
adverse reaction is localised oedema in cervical spine surgery. The incidence of adverse reactions with 
InductOs was not affected by gender, age or race. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Over 1700 patients have received InductOs in clinical studies. In the long-bone fracture studies, over 
500 patients received InductOs. In lumbar interbody fusion studies,  over 600 patients received 
InductOs. The remaining patients participated in studies using InductOs for indications not currently 
approved in the EU. These data are supplemented with information from use of InductOs in the 
general population.  
The frequency of adverse reactions in patients exposed to treatment with InductOs is presented in the 
table below. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10) or common (≥1/100 to <1/10). No 
reactions are observed with the frequency uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100),  rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).  
The frequencies of adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use of InductOs are not known 
as these reactions were reported from a population of uncertain size.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
New bone formation and bone remodelling 
As part of the pharmacological mechanism of action of dibotermin alfa, bone remodelling occurs (see 
section 5.1). In this process, both bone resorption and formation occur. In some circumstances an 
exaggeration of these processes can lead to complications such as nerve compression (due to 
heterotopic ossification) or device dislocation (associated with bone resorption or osteolysis).  
During two years follow-up in clinical trials for lumbar interbody fusion using a posterior approach, 
heterotopic ossification seen on radiographs occurred more often in patients treated with InductOs 
compared with autograft (see section 4.4). This radiographic finding may be asymptomatic or 
symptomatic. 
Fluid collection 
Due to the angiogenic activity of InductOs, fluid collection (pseudocyst, localised oedema, implant 
site effusion) can occur, sometimes encapsulated, sometimes resulting in nerve compression and/or 
pain. 
Localised oedema was common when InductOs was used for cervical spine fusion. The oedema was 
delayed in onset and, in some cases, severe enough to result in airway compromise (see section 4.4). 
Localised infection 
Localised infection specific to the fractured limb was very common (≥1/10) in patients in a clinical 
study in which the intramedullary canal was reamed to cortical chatter. An increased rate of infection 
was observed in the InductOs-treated group versus the standard of care control group (19% versus 9%, 
respectively; see section 4.4). For use with unreamed nails, estimated rates of infection were similar 
between treatment and control groups in a study (21% versus 23%, respectively). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose (i.e. a patient receives a concentration or amount of dibotermin alfa greater than 
recommended), treatment should be supportive. 
Use of InductOs in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery in amounts lower than or similar to 
those for lumbar interbody fusion has been associated with reports of localised oedema severe enough 
to result in airway compromise (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins, 
ATC code: M05BC01 
Dibotermin alfa is an osteoinductive protein that results in the induction of new bone tissue at the site 
of implantation. Dibotermin alfa binds to receptors on the surface of mesenchymal cells and causes 
cells to differentiate into cartilage- and bone-forming cells. The differentiated cells form trabecular 
bone as the matrix is degraded, with vascular invasion evident at the same time. The bone formation 
process develops from the outside of the implant towards the centre, until the entire InductOs implant 
is replaced by trabecular bone. 
Placement of InductOs into trabecular bone resulted in transient resorption of the bone surrounding the 
implant, followed by replacement with new, more dense bone. Remodeling of the surrounding bone 
occurs in a manner that is consistent with the biomechanical forces placed on it. The ability of 
InductOs to support bone remodeling may be responsible for the biological and biomechanical 
integration of the new bone induced by InductOs with that of the surrounding bone. Radiographic, 
biomechanical and histologic evaluation of the induced bone indicates that it functions biologically 
and biomechanically as native bone. Furthermore, non-clinical studies have indicated that the bone 
induced by InductOs, if fractured, can repair itself in a manner indistinguishable from native bone. 
Non-clinical studies have suggested that bone formation initiated by InductOs is a self-limiting 
process, forming a well-defined volume of bone. This self-limitation is likely due to the loss of 
dibotermin alfa from the implant site, as well as the presence of BMP inhibitors in the surrounding 
tissues. In addition, several non-clinical studies indicate that there is a negative feedback mechanism at 
the molecular level that limits bone induction by BMPs.  
Histological evidence from animal studies of lumbar interbody fusion using anterior or posterior 
surgical approaches showed dibotermin alfa administered with titanium, PEEK or allograft interbody 
devices was biocompatible and produced consistently high rates of fusion independent of surgical 
approach or device material with less fibrous tissue evident compared with autograft. 
Clinical pharmacology studies demonstrate that the matrix alone is not osteoinductive and is no longer 
present in biopsies taken as early as 16 weeks post-implantation.  
Pharmacodynamic information specific to lumbar interbody fusion studies 
The efficacy and safety of InductOs were demonstrated in a randomised, controlled, multicenter, 
non-inferiority study of 279 patients aged 19–78 years undergoing an open anterior lumbar interbody 
fusion procedure. Patients had received at least six months of non-operative treatment prior to 
treatment with InductOs for anterior lumbar spine fusion.  Patients were randomised to receive a 
titanium interbody fusion device filled with either InductOs or autogenous bone graft taken from the 
iliac crest. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At 24 months post-operation, InductOs was demonstrated to be statistically non-inferior to autogenous 
bone graft with a success rate for radiologically determined fusion of 94.4% for InductOs versus 
88.9% for autogenous bone graft (95% two-sided CI of the difference: -1.53, 12.46). For pain and 
disability (Oswestry score), the success rate was 72.9%  in the group using InductOs versus 72.5% in 
the group using autogenous bone graft (95% two-sided CI of the difference: -11.2, 12.0).  
A post-hoc meta-analysis of 6 controlled clinical trials with data from patients treated with InductOs 
or autogenous bone graft administered using CE-marked interbody fusion devices or allograft bone 
spacers and various surgical approaches showed that, at 24 months post-surgery, InductOs was 
associated with a higher fusion success rate (95%, 241 out of 255 patients) compared with autogenous 
bone graft (85 %, 177 out of 209 patients), with an odds ratio of 3.26 (95% CI: 1.172, 9.075; P = 
0.024).  The estimated absolute difference in fusion success rate between InductOs and autogenous 
bone graft was 11.7% (95% CI: 0.8%, 22.5%; P = 0.035). 
In a pooled safety data analysis of 8 clinical trials at 24 months post-surgery, the frequency of patients 
with pseudarthrosis was approximately 2-fold lower following treatment with InductOs (4.8%, 22 out 
of 456 patients) compared with autogenous bone graft (12.7%, 31 out of 244 patients).  
Pharmacodynamic information specific to acute tibia fracture studies 
The efficacy of InductOs was demonstrated in a multinational, randomized, controlled, single-blind 
study of 450 patients (age range 18 to 87 years; 81% male) with open tibial shaft fractures requiring 
surgical management. Patients received (in a 1:1:1 ratio) standard care (control group) consisting of 
intramedullary (IM) nail fixation and routine soft-tissue management, standard care plus InductOs 
0.75 mg/ml, or standard care plus InductOs 1.5 mg/ml. Patients were followed for 12 months after 
soft-tissue closure. 
In the acute tibia fracture pivotal trial, InductOs increased the probability of fracture healing; patients 
treated with InductOs 1.5 mg/ml had a 44% reduced risk for treatment failure (secondary intervention 
to promote fracture healing) compared with patients in the standard-care group (RR = 0.56; 95% 
CI = 0.40 to 0.78). These results were independently corroborated by a radiology panel blinded to 
treatment. The number of secondary and subsequent interventions was significantly reduced for the 
InductOs patients, particularly with regard to more invasive interventions, such as bone graft and 
exchange nailing (P = 0.0326). 
The proportion of patients healed after treatment with InductOs 1.5 mg/ml was significantly higher at 
all visits from 10 weeks to 12 months post-operative, suggesting accelerated fracture healing. 
InductOs 1.5 mg/ml was significantly effective (compared to standard care) in patients both with or 
without a history of smoking. 
Severity of fractures: Treatment with InductOs 1.5 mg/ml was significantly effective in all fracture 
classes, including severe Gustilo IIIB fractures (52% reduced risk of secondary interventions as 
compared to standard-care patients).  
The proportion of patients with healed soft-tissue wounds was significantly higher at the 6-week 
post-treatment visit in the InductOs 1.5 mg/ml group compared with the standard-care group (83% 
versus 65%; P= 0.0010).  The proportion of patients with hardware failure (locking screws bent or 
broken) was significantly lower in the InductOs 1.5 mg/ml group as compared to standard-care group 
(11% versus 22%; P= 0.0174). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
InductOs is active at the site of implantation. In two exploratory studies, pre- and post-surgery serum 
samples were collected from a few long-bone fracture patients. Dibotermin alfa was not detectable in

In animal studies (rats) using InductOs containing radiolabelled dibotermin alfa, the mean residence 
time at the site of implantation was 4-8 days. Peak levels of circulating dibotermin alfa (0.1% of the 
implanted dose) were observed within 6 hours following implantation. When injected intravenously, 
the terminal half-life of dibotermin alfa was 16 minutes in rats and 6.7 minutes in cynomolgus 
monkeys. It is concluded, therefore, that at the site of implantation, dibotermin alfa is slowly released 
from the matrix and rapidly cleared when taken up into the systemic circulation. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated exposure toxicity and genotoxicity.  
In reproductive toxicity studies in rats, where dibotermin alfa was administered intravenously to 
maximize systemic exposure, increased foetal weight and increased foetal ossification was observed 
and a treatment-related effect could not be ruled out. The clinical relevance of these effects is 
unknown.  
Anti-dibotermin antibodies have been investigated in pregnant rabbits following hyper-immunisation 
with dibotermin alfa to experimentally induce anti-dibotermin alfa antibodies. In some foetuses with 
decreased body weights, there were decreases in ossification of frontal and parietal bones (4 out of 
151 foetuses), which is generally considered to be reversible, and antibody related effects could not be 
ruled out. There were no other alterations in foetal external, visceral, or skeletal morphology. 
Dibotermin alfa has demonstrated variable effects on human tumour cell lines in vitro. The available 
in vivo data on human tumour cell lines do not suggest a potential for promotion of tumour growth or 
metastasis. As a single use product, InductOs has not been tested for in vivo carcinogenicity (see also 
section 4.3). 
InductOs has been studied in a canine spinal implantation model. InductOs was implanted directly 
onto the exposed dura following a laminectomy. Although narrowing of the neuroforamen and 
stenosis was observed, no mineralization of the dura, no spinal cord stenosis, and no neurological 
deficits subsequent to the application of InductOs were observed.

Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What InductOs is and what it is used for   
InductOs contains the active substance, dibotermin alfa. It is a copy of a protein called bone 
morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which is produced naturally by the body and helps with the 
formation of new bone tissue. 
InductOs may be used either in lower back spine fusion surgery or to repair fractures of the shin bone.   
Lower back spine fusion surgery 
If you have a lot of pain from a damaged disc in your lower back, and other treatments have not 
proven effective, you may be considered for lower back spine fusion surgery. InductOs is used instead 
of taking a bone graft from your hip; this avoids the problems and pain that can be caused by an 
operation to collect the bone graft. 
When used in lower back fusion surgery, InductOs is used in combination with a medical device, 
which corrects the position of your spine. If you have any question about the medical device, please 
ask your doctor. 
Fractures of the shin bone 
If you have broken your shin bone, InductOs is used, to help your fracture heal and to reduce the need 
for additional surgeries. It is used in addition to standard treatment and care of shin bone fractures. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive InductOs  
You should not receive InductOs  
• 
if you are allergic to dibotermin alfa or bovine collagen or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are still growing (skeletally immature). 
if you have an active infection at the surgery site. 
if the doctor treating you decides that you have inadequate blood supply at the fracture site.

for treating a fracture that is disease-related (e.g., fractures due to Paget’s disease or cancer). 
if you have been diagnosed with or are being treated for cancer. 
Warnings and precautions to be discussed with your doctor 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•

• 
• 
• 
You should inform your doctor if you have an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome or 
dermatomyositis/polymyositis.  
You should inform your doctor if you have any bone disease. 
You should inform your doctor of any history of cancer. 
The product should not be placed in direct contact with certain types of bones. Your surgeon 
will know which bones to avoid.   
Use of InductOs may cause bone formation (heterotopic ossification) in the surrounding tissues, 
which can result in complications.  
Some patients may develop nerve pain due to localised fluid collection, which would require 
drainage or a surgical procedure to remove the fluid. 
Some patients may develop antibodies (made by your body to fight a foreign protein) to 
InductOs.  While no harmful effects have been noted, the long-term effects are unknown.  
You should inform your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease. 
Localised swelling, in some cases resulting in breathing difficulty, has been reported in patients 
when InductOs has been used in surgery of the upper (neck) region of the spine. The safety and 
effectiveness of InductOs in spine surgery in the neck have not been established, and InductOs 
should not be used in this situation. 
Other medicines and InductOs  
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The effects of InductOs on pregnancy are not known. The use of the product in pregnant women is not 
advised.  
It is not known if InductOs passes into breast milk.  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before receiving this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
InductOs will not affect your ability to drive or operate machines. 
InductOs contains bovine collagen, a protein obtained from cattle 
Some patients may develop antibodies (made by your body to fight a foreign protein) against the 
collagen in the medicine
 In clinical studies, the presence of antibodies to collagen was not associated 
with side effects, such as allergies, nor was it shown to decrease the effectiveness of InductOs. If you 
think you have an allergic reaction to collagen, contact your doctor. 
.
InductOs contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per maximum dose (two 12 mg packs), i.e. it 
is essentially ‘sodium-free’.

3. 
How InductOs is given  
The doctor treating you will implant InductOs during surgery. The medical staff will prepare InductOs 
in the operating room. The powder is dissolved in the sterile water to form a solution that is used to 
soak the sponge. The soaked sponge is then implanted where bone growth is needed. Over time, the 
sponge will gradually disappear as new bone is formed. 
If you are receiving InductOs for lower back spine fusion, your surgeon will remove the damaged disc 
that is causing the pain and replace it with a medical device filled with InductOs. The medical device 
corrects the position of your spine, and InductOs encourages bone to grow between the two vertebrae 
to fix them permanently in the correct position.  
If you are receiving InductOs for a broken shin bone, your doctor will place InductOs around your 
broken bone when your fracture is treated.  The doctor will determine how much InductOs you will 
receive, depending on the size and number of fractures.  Generally, one 12 mg pack is used; however, 
a maximum of two 12 mg packs may be used.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
This  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  concerns  Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone  Sandoz  for 
treatment of adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilised 
on  levodopa/dopa  decarboxylase  (DDC)  inhibitor  treatment.  It  is  a  duplicate  application  to  the 
marketing authorisation (MA) of Stalevo (MA no. EU/1/03/260/001-038). 
The  active  substances  are 
levodopa,  carbidopa  and  entacapone  (ATC  code:  N04BA03; 
Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Dopaminergic agents: Dopa and dopa derivatives).
The  legal  basis  of  this  application  was  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/  EC,  Informed  consent 
application,  and  accordingly  a  complete  Module  1  is  submitted.  Letter  of  consent  from  the  MAH  of 
Stalevo  was  enclosed.  The  Applicant  (Orion  Corporation) is  the  marketing  authorisation  holder of  the 
cross-referred medicinal  product  Stalevo. The  Applicant had  also  obtained  a  MA  for  another duplicate 
of Stalevo, i.e. Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion.
The  following  information  was  updated  compared  to  the  approved  information  for  the  cross-referred
medicinal product Stalevo:
 Stalevo does not have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) hence the RMP was presented in the current 
application. 
 The  Product  Information  of  Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone  Sandoz  is  identical  with  the  Product 
Information of Stalevo, except for the following: Annex III, Package leaflet: the local representatives.
2.2.  Quality aspects
Since this application is an informed consent of the Stalevo application, the quality data in support of 
the Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Sandoz are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Stalevo 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures.
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
This  application  was  an  informed  consent  application  and  no  new  non-clinical  data  was  submitted. 
Therefore, the non-clinical data for Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Sandoz refers to and are identical 
to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Stalevo dossier. 
2.4.  Environmental risk assessment
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  application ,  the  medicinal  product  subject  to  this 
application  is  intended  to  be  administered  at  comparable  dose  levels  and  for  indications  that  were 
already  approved 
in 
the  Union 
for  Stalevo.  Based  on 
the  assumption 
that 
the 
levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone film-coated tablet was intended to substitute for identical products on
the  market,  the  approval  of  the  product  should  not  result  in  an  increase  of  the  total  quantity  of  the 
active ingredients released into the environment. Therefore, it should not result in an increase of risk 
to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal. Reference is therefore made to the 
CHMP assessment report
EMA/CHMP/707244/2013
Page 6/15
Environmental  risk  assessment  of  the  marketing  authorisation  application  of  the  original  medicinal 
product Stalevo (MA no. EU/1/03/260/001-038).
In  order  to  enhance  the  protection  of  the  environment,  a  general  statement  for  the  appropriate 
disposal of the unused medicinal product was included to the PL: 
“Medicine should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.” 
2.5.  Clinical aspects
This  application  is  an  informed  consent  application  and  no  additional  clinical  studies  have  been 
provided.  Therefore,  the  clinical  data  for  Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone  Sandoz refers  to  and  are 
identical  to  the  up-to-date  clinical  data  of  the  Stalevo  dossier.  For  Clinical  Overviews  and  Clinical 
Summaries please refer to Stalevo assessment reports EMEA/H/C/000511.
2.5.1.  Pharmacokinetics
Levodopa.  Absorption  of  levodopa  is  relatively  poor  (15–33  %)  and  food  may  delay  or  reduce 
absorption  of  levodopa.  Half-life  of  levodopa  is  about  0.6–1.3  hours.  No  accumulation  of  levodopa  is 
expected  in  repeated  administration.  Levodopa  is  extensively  metabolised  by  dopadecarboxylase  and 
by catechol-O-methyltransferease.
Carbidopa.  Absorption  of  carbidopa  is  somewhat  slower  than  levodopa  Tmax  being  about  1  hour. 
Bioavailability  of  carbidopa  is  about  40–70  %.  There  are  two  main  metabolites  for  carbidopa  and 
approximately 30 % of carbidopa dose are excreted unchanged in urine.
Entacapone.  Entacapone  is  absorbed  rapidly  and  peak  concentrations  are  achieved  about  one  hour 
after dosing. Pharmacokinetics is linear and peak concentrations increase proportionally with the dose.  
Elimination  half-life  of  entacapone  is  short  (ß-phase  about  0.5  h  and  γ-phase  2.4  h).  The  first-pass 
metabolism  of  entacapone  is  extensive  and  bioavailability  is  only  about  35  %.  Large  inter-  and 
individual  variability  is  seen  in  the  peak  concentrations  of  entacapone  but  there  seems  to  be  no 
accumulation  of  entacapone  during  repeated  administration.  Food  does  not  affect  absorption  of 
entacapone.
Entacapone  is  distributed  largely  and  the  volume  of  distribution  is  about  180  l.  The  total  plasma 
clearance is about 800 ml/min. Entacapone is largely bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. 
Entacapone  is  almost  completely  metabolised  prior  to  excretion  and  only  about  0.2%  of  the  dose  is 
found  unchanged  in  urine.  The  main  metabolic  pathways  are  glucuronidation  of  entacapone  and  a 
small amount of entacapone, the (E)-isomer, is converted to its (Z)-isomer.  The active metabolite of 
entacapone,  the  (Z)-isomer,  accounts  for  about  5%  of  the  total  amount  in  plasma.  About  10%  of 
entacapone dose is excreted in urine and the rest is eliminated via faeces by biliary excretion.
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance system
The  summary  of  pharmacovigilance  system  was  provided  in  module  1.8.1.  of  the  dossier  including 
information  required  according  to  Article  8(3)(ia)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  i.e. contact  details  of  the 
Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance) and the location of the Pharmacovigilance System Master File 
(with  the  QP).  Documentation  also  contained  a  statement  signed  by  the  MAH  and  the  QPPV  to  the 
CHMP assessment report
EMA/CHMP/707244/2013

effect that the MAH had the necessary means to fulfil the tasks and responsibilities listed in the Title IX 
of the Directive 2001/83/EC.
2.7.  Risk Management Plan
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:
PRAC Advice
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1, the PRAC  considers by consensus 
that  the  risk  management  system  for  levodopa,  carbidopa  and  entacapone  (Levodopa/Carbidopa/ 
Entacapone  Sandoz)  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease  and  end-of-dose 
motor  fluctuations  not  stabilised  on  levodopa/dopa  decarboxylase  (DDC)  inhibitor  treatment  could  be 
acceptable  provided  an  updated  risk  management  plan  and  satisfactory  responses  to  the  List  of

The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that
the  proposed  risk 
minimisation measures were sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication, 
but the recommendations given below were to be considered. 
In addition, the PRAC made several comments and requested that an update of the Risk management 
Plan is to be submitted to take the following minor points into consideration:
1. 
The Applicant should revise the RMP module SVII “Important identified and potential risks” and 
RMP module SVIII “Summary of the safety concerns” to better reflect the known safety profile of the 
product and the sections 4.4. and 4.8. of the SmPC, and consider any risk that could have an impact 
on the risk-benefit balance of the product or have implications for public health as important.
The  Applicant  should  provide  detailed  risk  data,  e.g.  frequency,  public  health  impact,  impact  on  the 
individual  patient,  risk  factors,  preventability,  potential  mechanism,  evidence  source  and  strength  of 
the  evidence,  and  provide  a  justification  for  the  classification  as  an  important  identified  vs.  potential 
risk.
CHMP assessment report
EMA/CHMP/707244/2013
Page 12/15
In  addition  to  the  safety  concerns  already  listed  in  the  summary  of  safety  concerns,  the  Applicant 
should consider, but not necessarily be limited, to the following additional important identified risk:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Depression with suicidal tendencies
Impulse control disorders
Thrombocytopenia
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage
Colitis
Orthostatic hypotension
Furthermore,  the  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  and  other  ischaemic  heart  disease  that  is  currently 
reported as a potential risk should be described as an important identified risk.
Since  seven strengths of  the  product  will  become  available,  medication error  should  be  included  as a
potential  risk.  On  the  other  hand,  medication  residue  should  not  be  considered  as  an  important  risk
and should be removed from the RMP.
2.
The  Applicant  should  revise  the  RMP  Part  III  “Pharmacovigilance  Plan”  to  reflect  the  changes 
requested  and  made  to  the  RMP  modules  SVII  “Important  identified  and  potential  risks”  and  SVIII 
“Summary of safety concerns”.
3.
The  Applicant  should  revise  the  RMP  Part  V  “Risk  minimisation  measures”  to  reflect  the 
changes requested and made to the RMP modules SVII “Important identified and potential risks” and 
SVIII “Summary of the safety concerns”.
4.
The  Applicant  should  revise  the  Summary  of  the  RMP  to  reflect  the  changes  requested  and 
made to the RMP. 
5.
Since the epidemiological studies on prostate cancer and myocardial infarction are included in 
the EU-RMP, the study protocols should also be included in Annex 6 of the RMP.”
The Applicant responded to the request and provided an updated RMP. 
In the updated RMP, version 1.1, the Applicant had listed the following safety concerns:

The  RMP  Part  III  “Pharmacovigilance  Plan”,  the  RMP  Part  V  “Risk  minimisation  measures”  and  the 
Summary of the RMP were adequately updated according to the changes made to the safety concerns.
It was requested that the Applicant add to the Part V and Part VI of the RMP for thrombocytopenia the 
following text in the SmPC that is presented as a routine risk minimization measure for liver and biliary 
system  disorders  and  liver  laboratory  abnormalities,  and  myocardial  infarction  and  other  ischemic 
heart disease, and also applies for thrombocytopenia:
“Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use: Periodic evaluation of hepatic, haematopoietic, 
cardiovascular and renal function is recommended during extended therapy with Levodopa/Carbidopa/ 
Entacapone Sandoz.”
According to the GVP Module V - Risk management systems, a summary of the RMP should be made 
publically  available  and  should  be  written  for  the lay  reader to  fulfill  the principles of  transparency in 
the legislation. Therefore, the Applicant was required to provide explanations for the abbreviations and 
terms  used  in  the  Summary  of  the  RMP  that  are  not  commonly  known,  such  as  DDCI  (dopa 
decarboxylase inhibitor).
The above mentioned changes could be regarded as minor stylistic changes and did not require further 
assessment.
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.
2.8.  User consultation
The applicant enclosed the user testing report performed for the combined PL of Stalevo 50/12.5/200 
mg,  100/25/200  mg  and  150/37.5/200  film-coated  tablets.  The  PL  version  tested  was  the  PL 
submitted  in  connection  with  Stalevo  renewal  application  (EMEA/H/C/511/R/040).  The  conducted

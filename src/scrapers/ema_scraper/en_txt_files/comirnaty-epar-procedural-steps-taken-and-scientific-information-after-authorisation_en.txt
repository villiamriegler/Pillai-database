C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
This variation concerns the update of the SmPC to include 
additional booster doses of Comirnaty in individuals 12 
years of age and older at least 3 months between the 
administration of Comirnaty and the last prior dose of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.  
This application is supported with safety and 
immunogenicity interim results following a fourth booster 
dose in two subsets from the phase III study C4591031 
(substudy D and E).  
The immune responses after a fourth dose show an 
increase of the neutralising antibody titres against Wuhan 
and Omicron BA.1 compared to pre-boost levels. In adults 
Page 19/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
55 years of age and older, the antibody titre increased 5.8-
fold (95% CI: 4.6, 7.2) against Omicron BA.1 strain and 
4.3-fold (95% CI: 3.7, 5.0) against Wuhan strain after 
Comirnaty Original 30µg vaccine one month after booster 
dose. In adults between 18- and 55-years of age, the 
antibody titres increased 3.4-fold (95% CI: 3.0, 3.8) for 
Omicron BA.1 and 3.0 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.3) for Wuhan strain. 
The overall safety profile for the fourth dose was similar to 
that observed after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). No 
new safety concerns have been identified.  
In addition, the MAH presented supportive evidence from 
observational studies that support an additional booster 
dose (fourth dose) of Comirnaty to improve protection 
against COVID-19. Relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 
34-65% against symptomatic COVID-19 were observed in 
various studies compared to three doses of the same 
vaccine. Relative VE against severe infections and 
hospitalization (64-71%) and death (72-78%) were higher.

considered that, as all Specific Obligations have been either 
fulfilled or reclassified as category 3 studies in the RMP, 
there are no remaining grounds for the marketing 
authorisation to remain conditional and therefore 
recommends the granting of a standard marketing

The administration of a third booster dose of Comirnaty in 
COMIRNATY 10 μg Concentrate for dispersion for 
injection in order to introduce a booster dose for 
children 5 to 11 years of age based on interim 
results from study C4591007; this is a Phase 1, 
Open-Label Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate Safety, 
Tolerability, and Immunogenicity and Phase 2/3 
Placebo-Controlled, Observer-Blinded Safety, 
Tolerability, and Immunogenicity Study of a SARS-
CoV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19 in 
children 5 to 11 years of age is supported by data from 
clinical study C4591007; this is an-going, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 study including healthy 
children from 6 months to <12 years of age.  
Efficacy of the booster dose in this age group was inferred 
by immunogenicity. The immunogenicity was assessed 
based on: SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing geometric mean titres 
(GMTs), geometric mean ratio (GMR) and seroresponse. 
The results from study C4591007 indicated an increase of

information. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMT against the wild-type strain, 
in children 5 through 11 years of age who had no 
serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 
infection, from 1253.9, 1-month post-dose 2 (primary 
series) to 2720.9, 1 month post-dose 3 (booster). This 
results in a GMR post-dose 3/post-dose 2 of 2.17 (2-sided 
95% CI: 1.76, 2.68). The seroresponse rate was almost 
100% after the third booster dose, using pre-dose values 
as reference. This is suggestive of an adequate boosting 
response. 
The safety profile after booster dose was consistent with 
the safety profile known for primary series of Comirnaty 
administered to children of the same age range. The most 
frequent adverse reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, 
headache, myalgia, chills, injection site redness and 
swelling.

booster dose of Comirnaty 30 µg in individuals 18 years of 
age and older who have received a primary course 
comprised of another mRNA vaccine or adenoviral vector 
vaccine has been assessed. This review took into 
consideration all available data from clinical studies, post-
marketing and real-world evidence. No new safety concerns 
have been identified.  
The reviewed literature evidence as well as the 
recommendations taken for the other mRNA vaccine 
approved in the EU further supported the shortening of the 
boosting interval to at least three months after completion 
of the primary course.

With regards to SO1, the MA Holder has provided additional 
characterisation data as requested.  
a) 
The potential for truncated transcripts to produce 
proteins/peptides was further investigated using a cell-free 
in vitro expression system. No truncated or other protein 
species were detected beyond the background bands 
observed in the negative control sample. The MAH will 
complement the characterization exercise using the cell-
free in vitro translation system with additional tozinameran 
batches.  
b) 
It is sufficiently demonstrated that the major 
proportion of fragmented species contains the 5’-cap but 
lacks the poly(A) tail.  
c) 
WB results obtained by three different antibodies, 
specific for the S1 domain, the receptor binding domain 
and the S2 domain, respectively, were presented and 
compared to theoretical masses of the S-protein and the

subdomains in glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms. It 
is sufficiently justified that the major band monitored 
corresponds to the heavily glycosylated S-protein. 
With regards to SO2, the MA Holder provided additional 
information to enhance the control strategy, including the 
active substance and finished product specifications. 
a) 
For active substance the acceptance criterion for 5’-
Cap has been tightened. For finished product acceptance 
criteria for osmolality, LNP size, RNA encapsulation, RNA 
content and lipids content (ALC-0315, ALC-0159, DSPC, 
cholesterol) and in vitro expression (IVE) assay have been 
tightened. The revised limits are sufficiently justified and 
found acceptable. The acceptance criteria for RNA integrity 
test in active substance and finished product specifications 
have been previously tightened during VAR IB-31-G. 
b) 
A new test method has been introduced and 
acceptably validated. 
c) 
The MAH previously presented data supporting the 
suitability of the ddPCR method, as being capable of 
detecting changes in the poly(A) tail content. The accuracy 
of the ddPCR method is sufficiently addressed. 
d) 
The acceptance criteria for RNA integrity test in 
active substance and finished product specifications have 
been previously tightened during VAR IB-31-G. The 
justifications for no further tightening of the finished 
product specifications for RNA integrity and LNP 
polydispersity in the current variation have been acceptably 
justified. 
e) 
Additional details have been provided to support 
the suitability of the IVE assay (cell-based flow cytometry) 
used for potency determination.

Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional 
to update safety and efficacy information 6 months 
post-dose 2 follow-up for adolescence 12 through 15 
years of age based on updated interim results from 
study C4591001, listed as a specific obligation; this 
is a Phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, 
interventional, dose-finding, study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-
confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-
controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after 
Dose 2 in the efficacy population.  
In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 
12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, 
there were no cases in 1,057 participants who received the 
vaccine and 28 cases out of 1,030 who received placebo.

13/01/2022 
24/01/2022 
SmPC 
Following the assessment of clinical trial, literature and 
an existing warning on anxiety-related reactions to 
add hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia and remove 
tingling sensations following the outcome of the 
Post-Authorisation Measure MEA-002.8 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/002.8, dated 30 September 
2021). 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 
hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency ‘not known’ 
following the outcome of the Post-Authorisation 
Measure MEA-002.8 (EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/002.8, 
dated 30 September 2021). The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
post-marketing safety data, a total of 21,793 cases were 
identified of which approximately 75% occurred within the 
day after vaccination. When available (~15% of the cases), 
the duration of the event was reported to be ≤2 days in 
~70% of the cases, which is considered a plausible time to 
onset (TTO).  
Hypoesthesia and paraesthesia are not sufficiently covered 
in the product information by the currently included text 
regarding stress-related reactions. Although approximately 
60% of the cases co-reported symptoms associated with an 
acute stress response/vasovagal episode, the remaining 
cases were not observed in the context of stress-related 
reactions (n = 9446). In these cases, co-reported events 
included reactogenicity adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
listed in the product information.  
Thus, the existing warning on anxiety-related reactions in 
the SmPC section 4.4 has been amended to remove tingling 
sensations and add paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia. These 
ADRs (paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia) have also been 
added to the list of adverse drug reactions with frequency 
‘not known’ in the SmPC section 4.8.

updated data (March 2021) from the pivotal study 
C4591001 with the MAH having conducted an interim 
analysis containing immunogenicity, efficacy and safety 
data.  
The presented efficacy data support the previous 
conclusions in the initial marketing authorisation approval, 
and all provided subgroup analyses are in agreement with 
previous data. A slightly lower point estimate of efficacy 
(92%) compared to previous analyses was obtained (95%). 
In addition, the reported interim data in this interim 
analysis, including reactogenicity and reported adverse 
events, supports the safety profile of Comirnaty 30µg in 
subjects ≥16 years of age obtained at the initial 
authorisation. Based on the safety data provided in this 
interim analysis, hyperhidrosis, night sweats, decreased 
appetite, asthenia and lethargy was added with a frequency 
uncommon to the list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.

The application for extension of the indication to include 
16 years of age and older" to "individuals 12 years of 
adolescents 12-15 years of age is based on a single pivotal 
age and older" for Comirnaty; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 2.0 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
modification of an approved one 
phase 1/2/3 study C4591001. It is an extension of the 
pivotal efficacy study in adults assessed in the initial 
approval of Comirnaty. The inferential analysis for the 12-
15 year olds which was to demonstrate non-inferior 
immune responses in this age cohort, compared to subjects 
16-25 years from the initial efficacy part of the same study.  
The effects of Comirnaty in children were investigated in 
2,260 children aged 12 to 15 years. The trial showed that 
the immune response to Comirnaty in this group was 
comparable to the immune response in the 16 to 25 age 
group. The efficacy of Comirnaty was calculated in close to 
2,000 children from 12 to 15 years of age who had no sign 
Page 71/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of previous infection. These received either the vaccine or a 
placebo. Of the 1,005 children receiving the vaccine, none 
developed COVID-19 compared to 16 children out of the 
978 who received the placebo. This means that, in this 
study, the vaccine was 100% effective at preventing 
COVID-19 (although the true rate could be between 75% 
and 100%). 
The most common side effects in children aged 12 to 15 
are similar to those in people aged 16 and above. They 
include pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, 
muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. These effects are 
usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days 
from the vaccination. 
The CHMP concluded that the benefits of Comirnaty in this 
age group outweigh the risks.  
The CHMP also noted that due to the limited number of 
children included in the study, the trial could not have 
detected rare side effects. The committee also noted that 
EMA’s safety committee PRAC is currently assessing very 
rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that occurred 
after vaccination with Comirnaty, mainly in people under 30 
years of age. Currently there is no indication that these 
cases are due to the vaccine and EMA is closely monitoring 
this issue. 
Despite this uncertainty, the CHMP considered that benefits 
of Comirnaty in children aged 12 to 15 outweigh the risks, 
in particular in children with conditions that increase the 
risk of severe COVID-19.

Unopened vial;  
Once removed from the freezer, the unopened vaccine can 
be stored for up to 5 days at 2 °C to 8 °C. Within the 5 
days shelf-life at 2 °C to 8 °C, up to 12 hours may be used 
for transportation. Prior to use, the unopened vaccine can 
be stored for up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C. 
Diluted medicinal product;  
Chemical and physical in-use stability, including during 
transportation, has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2 ºC 
to 30 ºC after dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection. From a microbiological point of view, 
the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the 
responsibility of the user. 
Handling of temperature excursions once removed from the 
freezer 
Stability data indicate that the unopened vial is stable for 
up to: 
• 
24 hours when stored at temperatures from -3 °C 
to 2 °C 
• 
a total of 4 hours when stored at temperatures 
from 8 °C to 30 °C; this includes the 2 hours at up to 30 °C

One vial (0.45 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL after 
dilution. In order to extract six doses from a single vial, low 
dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The 
low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should 
have a dead volume of no more than 35 microliters. If 
standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be 
enough of the vaccine to extract a sixth dose from a vial. If 
the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial after the fifth 
dose cannot provide a full dose (0.3 ml), the healthcare 
professional must discard the vial and its contents. There 
should be no pooling from multiple vials to make up a full 
dose, and any unused vaccine should be discarded 6 hours 
after dilution.  
The Labelling and PL have been updated accordingly.

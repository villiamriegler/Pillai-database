2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) the homeostatic system for maintaining physiological phosphorus 
balance is altered by the progressive loss of functioning nephrons. In early CKD, serum phosphorus levels 
are at near normal levels in children.  
Hyperphosphatemia is almost always observed in children on dialysis Failure to control 
hyperphosphatemia may be associated with debilitating sequelae and increased mortality. Studies in 
children with CKD have also demonstrated an association between hyperphosphatemia and CKD-
associated vasculopathy. Additionally, children with CKD often have impairment of linear growth. Careful 
management of phosphate and other interrelated mineral and bone defects may improve CKD-related 
defects in bone mineralization. 
The control of hyperphosphatemia is particularly challenging in paediatric CKD patients. Restricting 
phosphate intake by dietary means is the first line of treatment in CKD patients; however, this is difficult 
because of the need for adequate intake of proteins and calories to support skeletal growth. A major 
component of hyperphosphatemia management is the use of phosphate binders to decrease the intestinal 
absorption of dietary phosphorus. 
No phosphate binders have been approved for use in children; however organizations including the 
National Kidney Foundation endorse their use in paediatric CKD patients whose serum phosphorus levels 
cannot be controlled despite dietary restriction.  
In practice, aluminium containing phosphate binders are not used in children because of the risk for 
osteomalacia, encephalopathy and other neurological complications due to aluminium accumulation. 
Calcium-containing phosphate binders are widely used in children, but have been associated with 
hypercalcemia and may play a role in the development of a-dynamic renal osteodystrophy, as well as 
vascular calcification.  
Lanthanum carbonate is approved for use in end-stage renal disease patients, but is not recommended in 
paediatric CKD patients due to concerns about lanthanum deposition in developing bone including the 
growth plate.  
Sevelamer hydrochloride is also approved for adult patients on dialysis. Although an effective and well 
tolerated phosphate binder, studies in paediatric CKD patients suggest that sevelamer hydrochloride may 
not be optimal for use in paediatric patients who are vulnerable to acid-base imbalance. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
This application for already licensed products containing sevelamer carbonate will increase the 
environmental exposure to these medicinal products in case this new indication for paediatric patients is 
granted.  
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 7/31 
 
  
  
  
However, the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) performed for the already licenced products applies 
to the new indication and indicates no significant environmental risk and therefore no additional ERA 
study is indicted.  
As such, no precautionary and safety measures need to be imposed regarding the environmental release 
from use in patients or from disposal of unused products or waste materials derived from the medicinal 
products. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

10. The patient had a known allergy to sevelamer or any of its constituents. 
Treatments 
The study design is presented in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Schematic design of study SVCARB07609 
The study consisted of 3 periods with a total duration of 32 weeks for each patient: 
• 2 to 4-week phosphate binder Washout Period 
• 2-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Fixed Dose Period (FDP) and 
• 26-week open-label, sevelamer carbonate Dose Titration Period (DTP). 
Eligible patients taking a phosphate binder at Screening were to enter the Washout Period, in which the 
phosphate binder was to be discontinued for 2 to 4 weeks depending on the serum phosphorus levels. 
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 10/31 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once the patient’s blood serum phosphorus level was greater than the age appropriate upper limit of 
normal (ULN) (Table 1), patients who met all other eligibility criteria proceeded to the FDP. Patients not 
taking phosphate binder at screening, with serum phosphorus greater than their age appropriate ULN and 
satisfying all eligibility criteria, were to directly proceed to the FDP. 
Table 1. Serum phosphorus normal range by age (Source: National Kidney Foundation, 2009, Am J 
Kidney Dis) 
The dose of blinded sevelamer carbonate or placebo during the FDP was based on the patient’s Screening 
BSA category (<0.75, ≥0.75 to <1.2, ≥1.2 m2) as described in Table 2. 
Table 2. Fixed Dose Period dosing of study SVCARB07609 
Following the FDP, patients were to proceed to the open label DTP during which all patients were to 
receive sevelamer carbonate for additional 26 weeks. The starting dose of sevelamer carbonate for the 
DTP was the same as the dose prescribed during the FDP. However, if the patient’s serum phosphorus at 
Visit 3/Week 2 was below the age-defined lower limit of normal (LLN), the sevelamer carbonate dose was 
to be decreased or temporarily interrupted.  
In the DTP, the dose of sevelamer carbonate could be increased or decreased every 2 weeks for the first 
6 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter, as necessary, to achieve a serum phosphorus level within the age 
appropriate normal values, or until, in the Investigator’s opinion, the administered dose was the 
maximum that the patient could practically take or tolerate with meals. 
Dose titration increases or decreases were to be based on Screening BSA category. Dose titration 
increases or decreases smaller than indicated in Table 3 were permitted based on the Investigator’s 
judgment, but could not be lower than 0.2 g TID with meals/snacks.

Objectives 
The objectives of the study were to: 
•  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sevelamer carbonate   
•  Evaluate the efficacy of sevelamer carbonate on the control of serum phosphorus, in hyper-
phosphatemic paediatric patients with CKD. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was - change from baseline to Visit 3 (Week 2) in serum phosphorus (in 
mg/dL). 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to Visit 11/ET (Week 28/ET) in serum 
phosphorus (mg/dL). 
Sample size 
The following assumptions were used for the statistical power calculations: 
•  Detect  a  0.75  mg/dL  (0.24  mmol/L)  difference  in  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  2  between 
treatment groups. 
•  Standard  deviation  for  the  change  from  baseline  of  1.32  mg/dL  (0.43  mmol/L),  using  analysis  of 
covariance  (ANCOVA)  modelling  based  on  data  from  study  GD3-199-301  (which  has  been  evaluated 
during the initial authorisation application for Renvela). 
• Two-group t-test with two-sided 5% type I error rate and 80% power. 
Given these assumptions, 100 evaluable patients (50 per group) were required. Enrolment required that 
at least 20% of the patients be less than 13 years of age and at least 70% be receiving dialysis. 
Randomisation 
At Visit 2 (Week 0), patients meeting all entry criteria, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by 
screening body surface area (BSA) (≥1.2 versus <1.2 m²) and qualifying serum phosphorus (≥7.0 versus 
<7.0 mg/dL [≥2.26 versus <2.26 mmol/L]), to receive either blinded sevelamer carbonate or placebo 
during the 2-week FDP. 
Blinding (masking) 
The randomised phase of this trial was double-blinded. 
Statistical methods 
All data collected in this study were documented using summary tables and patient data listings. 
Computations for all results were performed using the SAS statistical software package. Descriptive 
summary statistics for categorical variables included frequency counts and percentages (n [%]), with 
percentages reported to the first decimal place.  
Continuous variables were summarized by the number of non-missing observations of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. Formal statistical inference (i.e., p-values) 
was performed only for comparisons of the efficacy parameters between treatment groups with two-sided 
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 12/31 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5% significance level. All p-values (except the one for the primary efficacy analysis) were presented for 
descriptive purposes; therefore, no adjustment for multiplicity was needed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Patients were enrolled at 29 study centres (23 sites in USA and 6 in Europe).  
A total of 128 patients were screened for this study, of which 27 patients (21.1%) were screen failures. 
A total of 101 patients were randomized in the trial as indicated in Table 4. Of these, 50 patients were 
randomized to receive sevelamer carbonate and 51 patients to receive placebo. A total of 100 patients 
were treated (received at least one dose of study medication). One patient, randomized to sevelamer 
carbonate, did not take any dose of the study medication (patient not treated) and was discontinued from 
the study by the Investigator (physician’s decision) due to noncompliance. This patient was considered as 
discontinued prior to being treated.

Conduct of the study 
The  study  protocol  was  amended  once,  to  add  an  exclusion  criterion  and  provide  some  clarifications 
regarding the conduct of the study. 
These amendments were considered minor. 
There  were  no  major  changes  in  the  planned  analyses  from  the  protocol  to  the  statistical  analysis  plan 
and no changes from the statistical analysis plan to database lock and after database lock. 
Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients included in the safety set from Study 
SVCARB07609 are provided in Table 5.

Numbers analysed 
Three datasets (the safety set, the full analysis set, and the per protocol set) were analysed and are 
presented in Table 6, as overall and by treatment group. 
Table 6. Analysis sets in Study SVCARB07609 
The Full Analysis Set for the Dose Titration Period (FAS–DTP) included 95 patients (94.1%), of whom, 46 
patients (92.0%) were on sevelamer carbonate in the FDP (“sevelamer carbonate group”) and 49 patients 
(96.1%) were on placebo in the FDP (“placebo group”). 
A total of 5 patients were excluded from the FAS-DTP (3 patients who were on sevelamer carbonate in 
the FDP and 2 patients who were on placebo in the FDP) due to no baseline phosphorus value or no 
phosphorus assessment taken post Visit 3 (Week 2). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint - change from baseline to Visit 3 (Week 2) in serum phosphorus (in mg/dL) 
using FAS-FDP is presented in Table 7.

Ancillary analyses 
The confirmatory analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint was conducted using the PPS-FDP and showed 
that sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 by an LS Mean 
difference of -1.15 (SD 0.407) mg/dL compared to placebo (p=0.007). Mean change from baseline to 
Week 2 was -0.90 (SD 1.714) mg/dL in sevelamer carbonate and 0.25 (SD 1.654) mg/dL in placebo. 
Subgroup analysis 
The results of the subgroup analysis in the FAS FDP (by Screening BSA < or ≥1.2 m2 and by mean 
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 17/31 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline serum phosphorus < or ≥7.0 mg/dL [<2.26 versus ≥2.26 mmol/L]) were: 
•   Screening BSA (m2) <1.2: mean change from baseline: -0.91 (SD 1.857) mg/dL in sevelamer 
carbonate and 0.27 (SD 1.615) mg/dL in placebo; 
• 
 Screening BSA (m2) ≥1.2: mean change from baseline: -0.86 (SD 1.631) mg/dL in sevelamer 
carbonate and 0.01 (SD 1.476) mg/dL in placebo; 
•   Mean baseline serum phosphorus <7.0 mg/dL: mean change from baseline: 0.05 (SD 1.097) mg/dL 
in sevelamer carbonate and 0.18 (SD 1.511) mg/dL in placebo; 
•   Mean baseline serum phosphorus ≥7.0 mg/dL: mean change from baseline: -1.95 (SD 1.541) mg/dL 
in sevelamer carbonate and -0.08 (SD 1.468) mg/dL in placebo. 
Results of subgroup analysis using the PPS FDP supported the results of subgroup analysis on FAS-FDP: 
•   Screening BSA (m2) <1.2: mean change from baseline: -1.90 (SD 2.007) mg/dL in sevelamer 
carbonate and -0.33 (SD 0.306) mg/dL in placebo. 
•   Screening BSA (m2) ≥1.2: mean change from baseline: -0.70 (SD 1.632) mg/dL in sevelamer 
carbonate and 0.34 (SD 1.759) mg/dL in placebo. 
•   Mean qualifying serum phosphorus <7.0 mg/dL: mean change from baseline: 0.03 (SD 1.250) 
mg/dL in sevelamer carbonate and 0.59 (SD 2.094) mg/dL in placebo. 
•   Mean qualifying serum phosphorus ≥7.0 mg/dL: mean change from baseline: -2.19 (SD 1.434) 
mg/dL in sevelamer carbonate and -0.01 (SD 1.249) mg/dL in placebo. 
Ad hoc analysis on patients with normal serum phosphorus 
In the FAS-FDP, at Week 2, four patients in each group (8.3% in sevelamer carbonate and 8.2% in 
placebo) had a serum phosphorus level within their age appropriate normal ranges. A similar percentage 
(8.3% [2 patients]) in sevelamer carbonate and 8.7% [2 patients] in placebo) was observed in the PPS-
FDP. 
Analysis of serum phosphorus levels over time in in FAS-FDP showed a decrease in serum phosphorus 
level during treatment with sevelamer carbonate. The most pronounced decrease in mean phosphorus 
level from baseline was achieved at the end of the first two weeks of active treatment (the mean change 
from baseline was -0.87 [SD 1.649, n=48] mg/dL at Week 2 in patients on sevelamer carbonate in the 
FDP and -0.77 [SD 1.592, n=46] mg/dL at Week 4 in patients on placebo in the FDP). 
 At the end of treatment the mean change from baseline was -0.94 (SD 2.116, n=33) mg/dL at Week 28 
(-1.17 [SD 2.184, n=48] mg/dL at Week 28/ET) in patients who were on sevelamer carbonate in the FDP 
and -1.12 [SD 1.840, n=33] mg/dL at Week 28 (-1.19 [SD 1.981, n=47] mg/dL at Week 28/ET) in 
patients who were on placebo in the FDP.  
At the last study visit (Week 28/ET), overall 26 patients (27.4%) had a serum phosphorus level within 
their age-appropriate normal ranges.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
This phase II study was a 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed dose period (FDP) followed by a 
6-month, single-arm, open-label, dose titration period (DTP) to study the efficacy and safety of sevelamer 
carbonate in hyperphosphatemic paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease. 
The proposed indication was for the the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients (>6 years of 
age and a body surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease, as no patients below those 
cut-off values were included in the study. Furthermore, Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that safety and 
efficacy of sevelamer carbonate have not been established in children below the age of 6 years or in 
children with a BSA below 0.75 m2. 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive sevelamer carbonate or placebo for 2 weeks. As there 
are no approved medications to treat hyperphosphatemia in children with CKD a placebo-controlled FDP 
was considered appropriate. Furthermore, the 2-week duration was selected to minimize the time 
patients may be receiving placebo.  
The DTP was a single-arm period during which all patients received sevelamer carbonate for a long-term 
period (6 months).  
The dose of sevelamer carbonate required in paediatric patients was expected to be less than that 
required in adults because the dietary phosphorus intake in children is less than that in adults and thus 
the phosphate binder needs are lower. Hence, the dosing strategy was that the starting and titration dose 
in patients was to be adjusted based on a patient’s screening BSA.  
A BSA <0.75 m2 typically represents young children not yet of school age whereas a BSA of ≥1.2 m2 
represents larger/adolescent children. As their phosphate binder needs are thought to be similar to that 
of adults, their dose was consistent with adult dosing.  
Therefore the recommended starting dose for paediatric patients is based on the patient’s body surface 
area (BSA) category. Similar to the recommendation in adults, sevelamer carbonate must be taken three 
times per day with meals and /or snacks. If a child eats less than 3 meals/snacks per day, sevelamer 
carbonate should only be given with meals/snacks and not on an empty stomach. This proposal was 
considered appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 81 patients (81.0%) were taking a phosphate binder at screening visit, similar in both 
groups.53 patients were taking sevelamer-based binder, again similarly divided in both groups. A 
calcium-based binder was taken by 36 patients. 
In paediatric patients with hyperphosphatemia secondary to CKD, sevelamer carbonate significantly 
reduced serum phosphorus through Week 2 by an LS Mean difference of -0.90 (SE 0.270) mg/dL 
compared to placebo (p=0.001). When patients with a baseline serum phosphorus levels in the normal 
range or below were excluded, LS mean difference was -1.07 mg/dL compared to placebo (p<0.001). 
This result was further supported by the analysis conducted on the PPS-FDP (LS Mean difference of -1.15 
[SD 0.407] mg/dL in sevelamer carbonate compared to placebo [p=0.007]). 
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 20/31 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Adult studies with various phosphate binders, e.g. lanthanum carbonate and colestilan, have determined 
that a clinically meaningful difference is at least 1.0 mg/d. Even though there are no such studies 
published for the paediatric population, there is no evidence to suggest that children should have a 
different criterion for what constitutes a clinically significant change in serum phosphorus. 
The CHMP noted that the overall proportion of serum phosphorus responders in paediatric patients in the 
current study (27.4%) was lower than the proportion observed in adult patients with chronic kidney 
disease (around 50%).  
However, in addition to responder rate, the proportion of patients achieving a serum phosphorus 
decrease even if not reaching normal range is also a relevant parameter to consider. In this respect 
serum phosphorus levels corresponding to the 75th percentile (Q3) provide relevant information. Q3 value 
in the placebo group evolved from 8.20 mg/dL to 8.30 mg/dL in the FDP. In the sevelamer carbonate 
group, Q3 value evolved from 8.45 mg/dL to 7.35 mg/dL, which highlights the substantial proportion of 
patients having their serum phosphorus levels decreased. 
In light of the above, the CHMP considered that the clinical effects demonstrated in the current study are 
of clinical relevance in the paediatric population. 
The treatment response during the 2-week FDP was not affected by BSA, and a slight increase in mean 
serum phosphorus was observed in patients with qualifying phosphorus levels <7.0 mg/dL.  
Results of subgroup analysis in FAS-FDP and PPS-FDP were consistent with results of primary efficacy 
analysis except for the subgroup with mean qualifying serum phosphorus <7.0 mg/dL (mean change from 
baseline: 0.05 [SD 1.097] mg/dL in FAS-FDP and 0.03 [SD 1.250] mg/dL in PPS-FDP), and this is 
reflected in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
A similar treatment response was observed in patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-
month open-label DTP. Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduced serum phosphorus through Week 
28/ET: the mean change from baseline to Week 28/ET was -1.18 (SD 2.122) mg/dL [p<0.0001]. 
Analysis of serum phosphorus levels over time clearly showed a decrease in serum phosphorus level 
during treatment with sevelamer carbonate.  
An ad hoc analysis showed that at Week 2, 8% of patients on sevelamer carbonate achieved a serum 
phosphorus level within their age appropriate normal ranges (a similar percentage was in patients on 
placebo). At the last study visit (Week 28/ET), overall 26 patients (27.4%) had a serum phosphorus level 
within their age-appropriate normal ranges. A similar percentage [28.4% (19 patients)] was observed at 
Week 28. 
For paediatric patients, serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate 
titrated in increments based on patient’s BSA, three times per day every 2 to 4 weeks until an acceptable 
serum phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring thereafter. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In paediatric patients with hyperphosphatemia secondary to CKD, sevelamer carbonate significantly 
reduced serum phosphorus levels compared to placebo during a 2-week FDP. The effect size was 
comparable to what is accepted as a meaningful response in adult patients. The results of the primary 
analysis were also supported by sub-group analyses based on BSA and baseline phosphorus levels. 
Serum phosphorus levels were within their age-appropriate normal ranges in approximately a quarter of 
the paediatric patients who received sevelamer carbonate during the 6-month open-label DTP.  
Overall the CHMP concluded that the available clinical efficacy data were adequate to support this

application for use of sevelamer carbonate for the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients 
(>6 years of age and a body surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Sevelamer carbonate is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving 
haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are from the 
gastrointestinal disorders system organ class.  
Very rare cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer 
hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, and levothyroxine.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 100 patients received the study drug. Of these, 49 patients received sevelamer carbonate and 
51 patients received placebo in the FDP of the study. 
In the Safety Set, the extent of exposure was similar across the two groups with a median exposure of 15 
days in each group in the FDP and a median exposure of 183.5 days and 183 days in the sevelamer 
carbonate group and the placebo group respectively in the DTP. 
The median prescribed daily dose in the FDP was 4.8 g in the sevelamer carbonate and placebo groups. 
The median prescribed daily dose in the DTP was higher in the sevelamer carbonate group (7.01 g) 
compared with the placebo group (6.42 g). 
The mean study treatment compliance in the FDP was slightly higher in patients on sevelamer carbonate 
(71%) compared with patients on placebo (68%). Mean study treatment compliance in the DTP was 
higher in the placebo group (77%) compared with the sevelamer carbonate group (71%). 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the Safety Set are detailed in Table 10.

Adverse events  
Fixed dose period: 
A total of 70 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 39 patients (39.0%) in the FDP: 34 
TEAEs in 19 patients (38.8%) on sevelamer carbonate and 36 TEAEs in 20 patients (39.2%) on placebo. 
There were 2 TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation in the FDP: 1 event in 1 patient (2%) on 
sevelamer carbonate (hyperphosphatemia) and 1 event in 1 patient (2%) on placebo (blood phosphorus 
increased).. 
Most TEAEs were mild in severity (47 events in 30 patients [30.0%]: 24 in 15 patients [30.6%] on 
sevelamer carbonate and 23 in 15 patients [29.4%] on placebo). 4 TEAEs in 2 patients (2.0%) were 
reported with severe severity (1 event in 1 patient [2.0%] on sevelamer carbonate and 3 events in 1 
patient [2.0%] on placebo). 
Seven TEAEs in 5 patients (5.0%) were reported as being related or possibly related to study drug: 4 
events in 2 patients (4.1%) on sevelamer carbonate and 3 events in 3 patients (5.9%) on placebo. Four 
TEAEs in sevelamer carbonate reported as related or possibly related to study drug included: 
hyperphosphataemia, abdominal pain, ocular hyperaemia, and muscle spasms. 
The most frequent TEAE in sevelamer carbonate was hypertension (3 events in 2 patients [4.1%] versus 
0 in placebo). The most frequent TEAE in placebo was vomiting (4 events in 3 patients [5.9%] versus 0 in 
sevelamer carbonate). 
Dose titration period: 
Overall 525 TEAEs occurred in 77 patients (77.0%) in the DTP: 253 TEAEs in 35 patients (71.4%) in the 
sevelamer carbonate group and 272 TEAEs in 42 patients (82.4%) in the placebo group. 
There were 3 TEAEs in 3 patients (3.0%) leading to study drug discontinuation in the DTP (2 of these 
events were reported as SAE): septic shock, varicella zoster virus infection, and chronic kidney disease*. 
Out of 525 TEAEs that occurred in 77 patients (77.0%) in the DTP, 313 TEAEs reported in 69 patients 
(69.0%), were mild in severity and 43 TEAEs in 20 patients [20.0%] were severe. 
22 TEAEs in 13 patients (13.0%) were reported as related or possibly related to study drug. Most of these 
TEAEs occurred in the MedDRA SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders (15 events in 8 patients [8.0%]) with 
nausea (5 events), constipation (3 events), vomiting and abdominal pain upper (2 events for each term) 
reported most frequently. 
TEAEs were most frequently reported for the MedDRA SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders. 
The most frequently occurring TEAEs were: vomiting (29 events in 20 patients [20.0%], abdominal pain 
and nausea (21 events in 15 patients [15.0%] for each term), pyrexia (25 events in 19 patients 
[19.0%]), headache (19 events in 17 patients [17.0%]), hypotension (14 events in 9 patients [9.0%]), 
abdominal pain upper (13 events in 9 patients [9.0%]), upper respiratory tract infection (12 events in 12 
patients [12.0%]), and diarrhea and hypertension (11 events in 7 patients [7.0%] for each term). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Fixed dose period: 
A total of 6 treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 5 patients (5.0%) in the FDP: 
a higher number of SAEs was reported in sevelamer carbonate (5 SAEs in 4 patients [8.2%] compared 
with placebo (1 SAE in 1 patient [2.0%]). 
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 23/31 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Among the SAEs in sevelamer carbonate, 1 was reported with severe severity, 2 SAEs were reported as 
moderate and 2 SAEs as mild. One SAE in placebo was reported with mild severity. 
No SAE was reported as related to the study drug. 
Five SAEs occurring in sevelamer carbonate were reported with the following PT: hypertension (2 events), 
device occlusion, peritonitis, and hyperkalaemia. One SAE in placebo was reported with the PT: 
gastroenteritis viral. 
Dose titration period: 
Overall, 79 SAEs occurred in 31 patients (31.0%) in the DTP. 
38 SAEs in 18 patients (18.0%) were reported with severe severity, 24 SAEs in 15 patients (15.0%) with 
moderate severity and the remaining 17 SAEs in 8 patients (8.0%) had mild severity. 
Four SAEs were reported as related or possibly related to study drug: constipation [2 events], post 
procedural constipation and gastritis. 
The most frequent (3 and 4 events) SAEs included: abdominal pain, device malfunction, renal impairment 
and pyrexia. 
Laboratory findings 
Serum calcium and calcium (adjusted for albumin) 
Changes  in  serum  calcium  over  time  from  baseline  to  the  last  study  visit  showed  clinically  insignificant 
changes. 
Serum calcium x phosphorus product 
In patients on sevelamer carbonate, the mean calcium x phosphorus product level decreased from 70.81 
(±21.305, n=49) mg2/dL2 at baseline to 61.92 (±13.461, n=48) mg2/dL2 at Week 2 (mean change from 
baseline of -8.63 [±16.752, n=48] mg2/dL2).  
In patients on placebo, the mean calcium x phosphorus product level increased from 69.49 (±19.429, 
n=51) mg2/dL2 at baseline to 70.39 (±20.427, n=49) mg2/dL2 at Week 2 (mean change from baseline 
of 0.42 [±16.616, n=49] mg2/dL2). For the overall safety set, the mean calcium x phosphorus product 
level decreased from 70.14 (±20.277, n=100) mg2/dL2 at baseline to 59.04 (±18.233, n=67) mg2/dL2 
at Week 28 (mean change from baseline of -9.60 [±20.285, n=67] mg2/dL2) and 58.81 (±18.688, 
n=98) mg2/dL2 at the last study visit (Week 28/ET) (mean change from baseline of -10.94 [±22.123, 
n=98] mg2/dL2). 
No particular safety issues or signals were identified in the review of the other clinical laboratory data 
(data not shown). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Sevelamer carbonate was well tolerated in this group of paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease. 
There were 5 TEAE (2 reported as SAE) leading to withdrawal (4 in patients treated with sevelamer 
carbonate and 1 in patient on placebo). 
There were no deaths reported during the study. 
EMA/305874/2017 
Page 24/31 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
In the blinded fixed dose period (FDP), 19 patients (38.8%) on sevelamer carbonate experienced 34 
TEAEs and 20 patients (39.2%) on placebo experienced 36 TEAEs. Of these, 1 patient on sevelamer 
carbonate and 1 patient on placebo had AEs of severe severity. One patient on sevelamer carbonate and 
1 patient on placebo discontinued due to an AE (hyperphosphatemia and high phosphorus level, 
respectively).  
TEAEs were most frequently reported for the MedDRA SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders which is expected 
given the available safety information from the adult population. To minimise such adverse events a 
warning has also been included in Section 4.2 sevelamer carbonate that should be taken with food and 
not on an empty stomach. 
During the DTP, majority of the AEs were mild or moderate and assessed as not related to sevelamer 
carbonate.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes in any of the laboratory parameters including serum 
chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and vitamins. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes 
in serum lipids measured (cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) over time from 
baseline to Week 28 of the study. 
The CHMP noted that the submitted study in support of this application had been conducted with a 0.8 g 
sachet, instead of the proposed 1.6 and 2.4 gr sachets or with 800 mg tablets in some patients with 
screening BSA ≥1.2 m2 .   The 0.8 g sachet  would appear to be more suitable for use in the intended 
paediatric population, as the recommend dosage depending on the BSA of the patient ranges between 
0.8-1.6 g three times daily and up/down titrations of 0.4-0.8 g three times daily. Furthermore, it was 
deemed that multiple daily tablets required to achieve the recommended doses would not be suitable for 
the paediatric population, and therefore the CHMP considered that the new paediatric indication should be 
granted only for the sachets but not for the tablet formulation. 
To ensure correct dose administration in the paediatric population, section 4.2 of the SmPC states that 
the content of the sachet can be divided, and that sevelamer carbonate  powder may be measured by 
volume (mL) using a measuring scoop or measuring spoon. In addition, medication errors in children  
have been included in the RMP as an important potential risk. The CHMP also recommended that the MAH 
further develops a pharmaceutical formulation, which would be more suitable for use in the intended 
paediatric population for sevelamer, e.g.  a 0.8 g sachet and a suitable device which would allow the 
accurate administration of the minimum 0.4 g increments of sevelamer in accordance with the product’s 
SPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Most of the AEs reported as related or possibly related to sevelamer carbonate were gastrointestinal in 
nature. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate in the 
paediatric population and the safety profile of sevelamer appears to be acceptable and in line with the 
risks described in the SmPC for adults.  
The potential for medication errors is addressed through appropriate wording in the product information 
and inclusion in the RMP. The MAH has also provided commitment to further develop a formulation more 
suitable in the paediatric population. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 30 October 2017.

The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.1 is acceptable. In addition, CHMP 
considered that the potential for medication errors should be considered as an important potential risk. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In CKD the homeostatic system for maintaining physiological phosphorus balance is altered by the 
progressive loss of functioning kidneys. In early CKD, serum phosphorus levels are at near normal levels 
in children.  
Hyperphosphatemia is almost always observed in children on dialysis. Failure to control 
hyperphosphatemia may be associated with debilitating sequelae and increased mortality. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The control of hyperphosphatemia is particularly challenging in paediatric CKD patients. Restricting 
phosphate intake by dietary means is the first line of treatment in paediatric CKD patients; however, this 
is difficult because of the need for adequate intake of proteins and calories to support skeletal growth. 
Dialysis removes some phosphorus in paediatric CKD patients, but it does not usually fully offset dietary 
absorption of phosphate.  
In adults, a major component of hyperphosphatemia management is the use of phosphate binders to 
decrease the intestinal absorption of dietary phosphorus. However, no phosphate binders have been 
approved for use in children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A phase 2, two-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed dose period followed by a 6-month, single-
arm, open-label, dose titration period study, (SVCARB07609 / DRI12793) was submitted to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in paediatric CKD patients.

and the efficacy secondary endpoint -change from baseline to Visit 11/ET (Week 28/ET) in serum 
phosphorus (mg/dL)-were both reached . Even if the effect size appears to be small, it is of similar 
magnitude to what is considered as clinically meaningful in adults. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Benefit in patients with baseline phosphorus levels <7.0 mg/dL was not demonstrated in this study. 
However it is difficult to draw conclusions about this sub-group of patients due to the small number of 
these patients. 
The proportion of serum phosphorus responders in paediatric patients in the current study (27.4%) was 
lower than the proportion observed in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (around 50%). 
Nevertheless, even if not reaching completely normal serum phosphorus levels, a substantial proportion 
of patients had their serum phosphorus levels decreased. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety and tolerability of sevelamer carbonate were similar to placebo during the FDP of the study. 
During the DTP, the majority of the AEs were mild or moderate and assessed as not related to sevelamer 
carbonate. The AEs were most frequently reported for the MedDRA SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders.  
The data reviewed and summarized were consistent with the known safety profile of sevelamer 
carbonate. No new risks or safety signals were identified with the use of sevelamer carbonate. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The study was conducted with a formulation which is not currently available. Even though, there no clear 
safety concern was identified in the case of incorrect dosage, the potential for medication errors has been 
included in the RMP and the MAH has committed to further develop a formulation and a device which 
could more easily facilitate correct dosing in children.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The decrease seen in the paediatric population with this phosphate binder is expected to have an 
important role in serum phosphorus levels control in the paediatric population. 
The safety profile of sevelamer carbonate is well characterised through the adult population and is limited 
primarily to gastrointestinal disorders which rarely have serious consequences. 
As no new safety signals were identified, compared to the adult population, the current warnings in the 
product information are expected to be adequate to manage the known risks associated with sevelamer 
carbonate use. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Phosphorus control in CKD patients is a combination of several measures, i.e. dietary measures, dialysis 
protocol and/or phosphate binders. Especially in view of the fact that no such products are currently 
authorised in the paediatric population, the observed decreases in serum phosphorus levels are 
considered of clinical relevance.   
As no new safety signals were identified, compared to the adult population, the current warnings in the 
product information are expected to be adequate to manage the known risks associated with sevelamer 
carbonate use. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Renvela/ Sevelamer carbonate Zentiva of product is positive.

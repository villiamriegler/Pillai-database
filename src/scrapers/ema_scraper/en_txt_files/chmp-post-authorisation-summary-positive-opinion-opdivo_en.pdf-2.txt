The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
"Opdivo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin."  
For information, the full indications for Opdivo will be as follows2: 
"Melanoma

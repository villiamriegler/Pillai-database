SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Granpidam in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. The Product 
Information is being updated in line with the SmPC 
guideline and the latest QRD template.

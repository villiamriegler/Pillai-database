1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Roche Registration GmbH submitted on 7 January 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Rozlytrek, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 12 October 2017. 
Rozlytrek was granted eligibility to PRIME on 13 October 2017 in the following indication: treatment of 
neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid 
tumours in adult and paediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or who 
have no acceptable standard therapy. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
-  Due to the lack of historical data in the patients with NTRK fusion-positive tumours, data are 
presented and discussed regardless of NTRK status. Considering the broad cancer types that 
may be suitable for treatment with entrectinib, unmet medical need was assessed for tumour 
types in which NTRK fusions have been observed to date. Overall these cancers present poor 
prognosis and significant levels of aggressiveness and mortality. The unmet medical need was 
recognised.  
-  Available nonclinical data were adequately supportive of the mechanism of action and potential 
activity across different tumour types.  
- 
Preliminary data in 26 adult patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours showed an ORR 
in 17/26 (65.4%) of patients supportive of promising activity. Responses were observed in 
most pre-treated patients (up to 4 prior lines of treatment) and in a range of heterogeneous 
histologies (sarcomas, NSCLC, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic).  
-  Despite the lack of historical data in biomarker-positive, this compared favourably with 
historical data in biomarker unrestricted 2+ line patients with included tumour types.  
-  Overall, this supported the potential for this therapeutic option to represent a major 
therapeutic advantage, at least for a subset of patients for whom an unmet need is likely 
undisputable (advanced stage with no available treatments).  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with 
neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive locally advanced or metastatic solid 
tumours, who have progressed following prior therapies or as initial therapy when there are no 
acceptable standard therapies.  
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive, advanced non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
 
 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0010/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0010/2019 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s requests for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance entrectinib contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Daniela Melchiorri was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 5 February 2018. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
Selection of regulatory starting materials, control strategy for active substance and drug product, 
stability data and plans, strength of available nonclinical evidence to support histology independent 
NTRK clinical indication, plans for generation of additional nonclinical evidence, criteria for selection of 
the target population and plans for collection of historical data on prognosis of patients with NTRK 
fusion mutations, proposed confirmatory data, ROS-1 development strategy, paediatric investigation 
plan. 
 
 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on the development for the indication from the 
CHMP on 22 October 2015 EMEA/H/SA/3140/1/2015/SME/III), 20 July 2017 
(EMEA/H/SA/3140/2/2017/SME/II), 09 November 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3140/3/2017/SME/II, 
EMEA/H/SA/3140/2/FU/1/2017/SME/II and EMEA/H/SA/3140/4/2017/SME/I), 26 July 2018 
(EMEA/H/SA/3140/FU/1/2018/PR/I). 
The Scientific Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
▪  Proposals  for  drug  substance  starting  materials,  impurities  qualification,  control  strategy, 
stability  data,  process  validation;  drug  product  dissolution  method,  manufacturing  control 
strategy, stability plan, registration pilot scale; in vitro analytical comparison plan to bridge from 
drug product clinical development lots to the commercial registration lots; 
▪  Adequacy of the non-clinical program to support a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for 
entrectinib; 
▪ 
Proposal for clinical pharmacology characterisation, including the ADME profile; CYP drug-drug 
interaction (DDI), intrinsic factors and effects on QT assessments; 
▪ 
The  use  of  a  basket  trial  design  (STARTRK-2)  to  support  registration  in  multiple  tumour 
types/gene  arrangements;  the  suitability  of  a  two-step  assay  (IHC  followed  by  NGS)  for 
identifying patients for enrolment in STARTRK-2; the use of ORR as primary endpoint; whether 
a  response  rate  of 20%  would  be  considered  a  clinically  meaningful  benefit;  the  proposed 
primary  and  secondary  efficacy  analyses;  the  sample  size  requirements  for  the  three  NTRK 
genotypes in the study; the suitable type of Marketing Authorisation for non-conventional clinical 
programme; 
▪ 
The pooling of data across studies ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2, and STARTRK-NG; 
the  adequacy  of  the  key  statistical  assumptions  to  support  the  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  of 
entrectinib in the ROS1 fusion-positive, ROS1 inhibitor-naïve, NSCLC patient population; the size 
of the safety database for the pooled safety data from studies ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1, and 
STARTRK-2.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant is seeking the approval of two separate therapeutic indications for Entrectinib:  
- adult and paediatric patients with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive 
locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours, who have progressed following prior therapies or as 
initial therapy when there are no acceptable standard therapies. 
- patients with ROS1-positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours  
NTRK fusions are rare events in common adult cancers, e.g. frequency of <1% in NSCLC and 1-2% in 
CRC, and more frequently observed in some rare cancers, e.g. 90-100% in mammary analogue 
secretory carcinoma (MASC), a rare form of salivary gland cancer (representing <1% of all cancer 
malignancies), and secretory breast cancer (SBC), for which NTRK fusion expression (ETV6-NTRK3) is 
a pathognomonic hallmark for both diseases1.  
NTRK fusions have also been described in several pediatric tumours including infantile fibrosarcoma 
(IFS) or the related congenital mesoblastic nephroma (for which the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion is also a 
characteristic feature), and with high frequency (~40%) in high grade glioma in patients <3 years of 
age2. 
The overall prevalence of NTRK fusions in all cancer patients is estimated to be 0.25-1%345.

Table 1: Incidence of NTRK gene fusions across multiple solid tumour histologies in adult 
and paediatric patients 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC  
Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause 
of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths)6. NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung 
cancer cases, that include non-squamous (i.e, adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell 
types) and squamous cell carcinoma. Nearly half of all lung cancers is adenocarcinoma. Over the last 
decades, in Europe squamous NSCLC decreased while adenocarcinoma has increased in men, while in 
women both squamous NSCLC and adenocarcinoma are still increasing7.  
In recent years, a number of molecular alterations have been identified in NSCLC, leading to the 
development and approval of targeted therapies with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) activity, 
such as erlotinib, afatinib, gefitinib, osimertinib and dacomitinib for epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutations; crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib for ALK gene fusions, 
crizotinib for ROS1 gene fusions, and dabrafenib in combination with trametinib for BRAF V600 
mutation.

In general, the mutations/alterations are seen in a non-overlapping fashion, although between 1%-3% 
harbour concurrent alterations8. According to current guidelines, EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF V600 
should be tested in advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Molecular EGFR and ALK testing are not 
recommended in patients with a confident diagnosis of SCC, except in unusual cases, e.g. 
never/former light smokers or long-time ex-smokers9.  
Development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1, as monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy, has recently led to major changes in the treatment paradigm for 
patients with advanced NSCLC over the last few years. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours  
The neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase family of genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 encode the 
tropomyosin receptor kinases A, B and C (TRKA, TRKB and TRKC), respectively. TRK family members 
are transmembrane proteins serving as high affinity signal transducing receptors for neurotrophins. 
They are expressed in neuronal tissue and play an essential physiological role in the development and 
function of the central and peripheral nervous systems. TRKA binds nerve growth factor (NGF), TRKB 
binds brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4, also known as NTF5) with high 
affinity and neurotrophin-3 (NT3) to a lesser extent and TRKC binds NT3. Binding of neurotrophins to 
their cognate TRK receptors results in homodimerization, receptor autophosphorylation and activation 
of downstream signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and survival of 
neurons and other cell types. 
NTRK gene fusions arise from intra- or inter-chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose 3’ NTRK 
gene sequences encoding the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain in-frame with various 5’ partner gene 
sequences10. The transcribed chimeric TRK proteins have been shown to be oncogenic, promoting 
tumorigenesis by constitutive ligand-independent kinase activation leading to tumour cell proliferation, 
differentiation, and/or apoptosis. 
At least 25 different oncogenic NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions have been reported across at least 11 specific 
tumour types11 12.

Figure 1: TRKA/B/C (NTRK1/2/3) fusion structure and resultant signalling 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC  
The ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), located on chromosome 6, encodes an orphan receptor tyrosine 
kinase without a known ligand, whose physiological function is still unclear. Chromosomal 
translocations can result in ROS1 gene rearrangements, firstly reported in NSCLC in 2007, 
characterised by fusions with other genes. So far, 22 different fusion partner genes have been 
identified in lung cancer patients13, being CD74-ROS1 fusion the most common rearrangement. These 
fusion events lead to constitutive activation of the ROS1 kinase that drives cellular transformation and 
promotes survival and proliferation through downstream signaling via SHP-1/SHP-2, JAK/STAT, 
PI3K/AKT/MTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. ROS1 rearranged NSCLC has been described as a distinct 
molecular type in approximately 1–2% of patients with NSCLC14. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours  
At the time that the entrectinib development program was initiated, there were limited publicly 
available data on the outcomes of patients specifically with NTRK fusion-positive tumours.  
Reported below some data regarding the tumour types characterized by high prevalence (>90%) of 
NTRK gene fusion:

Mammary Analogue Secretory Carcinoma (MASC): this is a salivary gland malignancy. Standard 
optimised treatment for MASC is not well defined; most studies in the literature are retrospective15. 
Current treatment is similar to other salivary gland malignancies with surgical excision being the 
primary approach, alone or with post-operative radiotherapy16. While usually a low grade malignancy, 
high-grade transformation of MASC has been described. Aggressive salvage surgery is recommended 
in the context of managing metastatic salivary gland tumours, given the morbidity associated with 
tumour progression and the lack of significant response associated with other available treatment 
modalities. Various chemotherapy regimens have displayed modest response rates with unclear 
survival advantages in patients with metastatic salivary gland cancer. 
Secretory Breast Cancers (SBCs): This is a very rare type of breast cancer, generally associated 
with a favorable prognosis, although having triple-negative phenotype. There are no consensus 
guideline recommendations for treatment of SBC. Most SBC cases are treated in a manner similar to 
invasive ductal carcinoma with surgical resection being the primary means of treatment, although the 
extent of surgery ranges from wide local excision only to radical mastectomy depending on the age of 
the patient and technical difficulties of breast conservation (e.g. in young children)17. The use of 
systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of secretory breast cancer varies across 
the literature. Radiotherapy is usually used in adults following breast-conserving surgery18 while 
limited data support the use of hormone therapy (for hormone-positive secretory breast tumours) or 
chemotherapy in cases with poorly circumscribed tumours19. 
Congenital Infantile fibrosarcoma: Congenital infantile fibrosarcoma (CIFS) is a rare mesenchymal 
tumour that is primarily developed in the soft tissue of distal extremities, accounting for 10% of STS in 
children, and usually occurring in the first year of life. Surgery is the treatment of choice for the 
majority of cases where IFS remains localised and is associated with a good prognosis. Complete non-
mutilating resection is rarely feasible, and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has been 
demonstrated to be effective in reducing tumour size to allow conservative surgery20. The 
chemotherapy combination of vincristine and actinomycin D is the most commonly used and is absent 
of the toxicities in infants associated with alkylating agents or anthracyclines. Despite good control in 
many patients with initial surgery and chemotherapy, the clinical course can be aggressive for some 
patients with local recurrences and metastatic spread requiring multiple additional surgeries and 
adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC  
ROS1 and ALK tyrosine kinase domains also share significant homology, including bindings sites for 
ATP and crizotinib. Similarly to ALK rearranged tumours, patients with ROS1 positive NSCLC are more 
commonly of younger age, have history of never or light smoking, and have adenocarcinoma 
histology21. However, ROS1-rearranged NSCLC was described to have significantly lower rates of

extra-thoracic and intracranial metastases at the time of diagnosis, as well as lower cumulative 
incidence of intracranial metastases22, although a subsequent single institution retrospective study 
described similar rates of intracranial metastases at diagnosis among patients with ALK and ROS1 
rearranged lung cancers23. CD74-ROS1 fusion variant was found to increase the predilection for CNS 
metastasis compared to non-CD74-ROS1 fusion variant24. Overall, the incidence of brain metastases 
from prospective trials of ROS1 TKIs ranged approximately from 20% to 40% in TKI-naïve patients 
and from 30% to 50% in TKI-pretreated patients25.  
Commonly used methods for ROS1 fusion detection have included fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH), immunohystochemistry (IHC), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 
next generation sequencing (NGS). According to ESMO guidelines, IHC may be used as a screening 
approach, although it is currently not recommended as the primary treatment determining test. FISH 
has been the standard approach to detecting ROS1 rearrangements. NGS is an emerging technology. 
Multiplex, massively parallel, so-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) of various sorts is rapidly 
being adopted as the standard approach to screening adenocarcinomas for oncogenic targets. 
Whatever testing modality is used, it is mandatory that adequate internal validation and quality control 
measures are in place and that laboratories participate in, and perform adequately in, external quality 
assurance schemes for each biomarker test26. RT-PCR assays may lead to under-detection of ROS1 
fusion events as miss the detection of previously unknown fusion partners. For comparison, NGS allows 
for the detection of known as well as novel fusions27.  
With more than one detection methodology now available, there will be an increasing number of cases 
where they produce conflicting test results, posing a diagnostic and therefore therapeutic challenge. 
Additionally, recent studies with multiregion sequencing have shown significant tumour heterogeneity 
with subclone-specific mutations, although none of these studies investigated the clonal nature of ALK 
or ROS12829. 
2.1.5.  Management 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours  
The proposed indication for the use of entrectinib in this application is for patients with NTRK fusion-
positive locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours who have progressed following prior therapies or 
as initial therapy when there are no acceptable standard therapies. The prognosis for these patients is 
poor, particularly when there is CNS involvement. Expected response rates to later lines of treatment 
in this setting are typically <30% and median duration of response (mDOR) <10 months across 
available approved agents for various tumour types. Patients who have exhausted these options or 
patients with tumours for which no standard or approved option is available, receive best supportive 
care or are entered into Phase I clinical trials where the expected response rates are ≤10%.

In September 2019, the NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib was granted conditional marketing authorisation in 
the EU for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid tumours that display a NTRK gene 
fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result  in severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment options, based on an pooled 
primary analysis set for efficacy including 93 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer enrolled across 3 
ongoing open-label single arm studies (of those, 28 patients were pediatric), and additional 9 subjects 
with primary CNS disease. The ORR in the pooled efficacy dataset was 72% (95%CI 62, 81), with 16% 
of CR. Median DOR was NR (range 1.6+, 38.7+) with 88% with duration more than 12 months. Among 
5 evaluable patients with non-primary CNS tumor with brain metastases, 3 had PR (2 thyroid, 1 lung) 
and 2 had SD (lung); overall ORR was 60% (95% CI: 15-95).  
The safety of Larotrectinib was evaluated in 125 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer. The most 
common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of Vitrakvi were fatigue (32%), increased ALT (31%), 
dizziness (30%), increased AST (29%), constipation (29%), nausea (26%), anaemia (24%), and 
vomiting (20%). The majority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 4 was the highest 
reported grade for adverse reactions neutrophil count decreased (1.6%) and ALT increased (< 1%). 
The highest reported grade was Grade 3 for adverse reactions anaemia, weight increased, fatigue, 
increased AST, dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, myalgia, and leukocyte count decreased. All the 
reported Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of patients, with the exception of 
anaemia (7%). Permanent discontinuation of Vitrakvi for treatment emergent adverse reactions, 
regardless of attribution occurred in 3% of patients. (Vitrakvi EU SmPC, Vitrakvi EPAR).

ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC  
Crizotinib (XALKORI, ALK, ROS1 and MET inhibitor) is the only ROS1 inhibitor authorised in EU for the 
treatment of adults with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. Crizotinib was approved based on the results 
from  53  patients  with  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  in  the  Phase  I/II  study  PROFILE  1001.  The  objective 
response rate was 70% (95% CI: 56%, 82%). Median time to tumour response was 7.9 weeks. Median 
duration of response (DOR) had not been reached (95% CI: 15.2, NR), median PFS at the time of data 
cut-off was 19.3 months (95% CI: 14.8, NR), and median OS was not reached [probability of survival at 
 
 
 
6 months 90.6% (95%CI: 78.8, 96.0), probability of survival at 12 months 79% (95% CI: 65.3, 87.8)]. 
No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  from  patients  with  ROS1-positive  NSCLC  in  Study  1001  as 
compared  with  the  already  established  safety  profile  for  crizotinib30.  Updated  results,  for  crizotinib  in 
ROS1 rearranged advanced NSCLC, including overall survival, from PROFILE 1001, after a median follow-
up of 62.6 months, showed consistent ORR 72%, with 6 CR (11%). Median duration of response is now 
reached, being 24.7 months (95%CI 15.2, 45.3). With 68% of PFS events (36/53 patients), median PFS 
was confirmed at 19.3 months (95%CI 15.2, 39.1). Median OS is now reached: death events in 26/53 
patients [49%], median OS 51.4 months (95% CI, 29.3–not reached [NR]), probabilities of survival at 
6,  12,  24,  36,  and  48  months  were  91%,  79%,  67%,  53%,  and  51%,  respectively.  There  was  no 
apparent correlation between the specific ROS1 rearrangment and OS31.

According  to  ESMO  guidelines,  single-agent  crizotinib  is  recommended  in  the  1L  setting  or  as  2L  in 
patients with stage IV NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement. If patients have received crizotinib in the 1L 
setting, then they may be offered platinum-based chemotherapy therapy in the 2L setting.  
The development of resistance to crizotinib represents a major hurdle and causes the vast majority of 
patients to eventually progress on therapy. Resistance can occur through: 1) “on target” mutations in 
crizotinib binding sites within the ROS1 tyrosine  kinase  domain, 2) “off target” mechanisms including 
activation  of  bypass  signaling  pathways  (i.e.,  EGFR,  RAS  and  KIT)  and  phenotypic  changes  such  as 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The most commonly observed crizotinib resistance mutation has 
been  ROS1-G2032R  mutation  in  the  solvent-front  (i.e.  solvent-exposed  region  of  the  kinase).  Other 
mutations  include  solvent  front  D2033N,  S1986Y/F,  gatekeeper  L2026M,  and  L1951R.  Various  drugs 
have been tested against these resistance mutations using in vitro studies3233. 
Other ROS1 inhibitors are under evaluation in clinical trials, which include first generation ROS1 TKIs 
Ceritinib, Brigatinib and Cabozantinib, and second generation ROS1 TKIs Lorlatinib, Repotrectinib (TPX-
0005) and DS-6051b30.

Intracranial activity of crizotinib: Information regarding any intracranial activity of crizotinib in 
ROS1-positive NSCLC patients with CNS disease are not available in literature. In PROFILE 1001 study, 
patients with brain metastases, spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal 
disease were allowed if appropriately treated and neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks (Xalkori 
EPAR EMEA/H/C/002489/II/0039). Publicly available reports of the study make no mention of CNS 
involvement at study entry, and no CNS endpoints are reported3435. 
Systemic response (inclusive, but not limited to CNS disease) and PFS have been reported in an Asian 
trial of crizotinib in ROS1-positive NSCLC, but intracranial activity was not specifically evaluated. In this 
trial, BICR assessed systemic ORR in patients with CNS disease at baseline was similar to that of 
patients without CNS disease (73.9% [95% CI: 51.6, 89.8] vs 71.2% [95% CI: 61.4, 79.6]). However, 
median PFS per BICR assessment was lower in patients with CNS disease at baseline compared with 
those without CNS disease at baseline (10.2 months [95% CI: 5.6, 13.1] vs. 18.8 months [95% CI: 
13.1; NR]) (OxOnc)36. 
In ALK-positive NSCLC patients, crizotinib has shown numerically lower intracranial response rates (50% 
[95% CI: 28, 72] for measurable CNS disease) relative to systemic response (75.5% [95% CI: 67.8, 
82.1] in the ITT population)37. Median duration of response for intracranial disease was 5.5 months (95% 
CI: 2.1, 17.3), compared to median duration of response with systemic disease of 11.1 months (95% 
CI: 7.9, 13.0). Crizotinib is a substrate of active efflux by the p-glycoprotein-1 (P-gp) transporter that 
is highly expressed within the blood-brain barrier (BBB)38. ALK positive patients treated with crizotinib 
were observed to have incidence of CNS progression of 41.4% at 12 months39. 
About the product 
Entrectinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TRKA, TRKB and TRKC (encoded by the genes NTRK1, 
NTRK2 and NTRK3, respectively), ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase (encoded by the 
gene ROS1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK; encoded by the gene ALK), with IC50 values for 
kinase inhibition in the low nanomolar range.  
Gene rearrangements (fusions) in each of the genes encoding these target kinases have the potential 
to be oncogenic drivers, tend to be mutually exclusive, and have been observed at low incidence in a 
variety of tumour types. 
The CHMP concluded that the following indications are approvable: 
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of 
age and older, with solid tumours that have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene 
fusion,  
- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result 
in severe morbidity, and

- who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor 
- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1-positive, 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors. 
Treatment with Rozlytrek should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
A validated assay is required for the selection of patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive solid 
tumours. NTRK gene fusion-positive status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy. 
A validated assay is required for the selection of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC. ROS1-positive 
status must be established prior to initiation of Rozlytrek therapy. 
The recommended dose for adults is 600 mg entrectinib once daily. 
The recommended dose for paediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 300 mg/m2 body surface 
area (BSA) entrectinib once daily.

It is recommended that patients are treated with Rozlytrek until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
If a planned dose of Rozlytrek is missed, patients can make up that dose unless the next dose is due 
within 12 hours. If vomiting occurs immediately after taking a dose of Rozlytrek, patients may repeat 
that dose. 
Management of adverse reactions may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of treatment with Rozlytrek, in case of specified adverse reactions or based on the 
prescriber’s assessment of the patient’s safety or tolerability. 
For adults, the dose of Rozlytrek may be reduced up to 2 times, based on tolerability. Rozlytrek 
treatment should be permanently discontinued if patients are unable to tolerate a dose of 200 mg once 
daily.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the Applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This decision was based on the following: 
“although the data in patients with NTRK fusion-positive locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours 
are promising, the quantification of the unmet need and the potential advantage of entrectinib over 
crizotinib in the ROS1-positive NSCLC patients is uncertain. As the applicant has not adequately 
substantiated that entrectinib is of major public health interest in ROS1-positive NSCLC patients, the 
CHMP was of the view that the request for accelerated assessment has not been satisfactorily 
justified”. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, based on the following criteria: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
The Applicant claims that, in the pooled analysis including 74 adult subjects, the ORR by BICR of 
63.5% is clinically meaningful, and that responses were durable (median DOR of 12.9 months in 
responders). Responses were recorded in all solid tumor categories included in the integrated dataset 
independent of tumor histology or patients age, and similar response rates were demonstrated 
regardless whether patients had CNS disease at baseline or not. Intracranial activity was observed in 
patients with CNS metastases (IC-ORR 50%), with median IC-DOR of 8 months. For the 5 pediatric 
patients who had NTRK fusion and ≥6 months of follow-up, including 2 with primary CNS tumor, all 
patients achieved an objective response by BICR (2 CR and 3 PR). Based on safety data from 504 
patients, the Applicant considered the safety profile favorable and entrectinib well tolerated. Most 
frequently reported AEs (in ≥25% of patients) were fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia, dizziness, 
diarrhea, nausea, anemia, peripheral edema, dyspnea, weight increased and blood creatinine 
increased. Grade 3-4 occurred in 60% of subjects. Most of grade 5 events (5%) occurred in the 
context of underlying malignancy or its complication and 2/24 were considered treatment related 
(sudden death and cardiac arrest). AEs could generally be well managed with dose reduction or 
interruption, and thus there was a low discontinuation rate due to AEs (9%). The safety profile of 
entrectinib in the paediatric population was considered consistent with the overall safety population 
except where noted. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
 
 
 
 
The Applicant is proposing the following SOB measures:  
“Specific Obligation number 1 (SOB-1) by 31 March 2027 
In  order  to  further  confirm  the  histology-independent  efficacy  of  entrectinib  in  adults  and  paediatric 
patients,  the  MAH  should  submit  a  pooled  analysis  of  an  increased  number  of  NTRK  fusion-positive 
patients from ongoing and proposed clinical trials.”  
Objectives:  more  precise  characterisation  of  entrectinib  efficacy  across  tumor  types;  more  precise 
characterization of entrectinib lack of efficacy in a certain setting.   
For SOB-1, the Applicant proposes to expande the pool with at least 200 additional patients with NTRK 
fusion positive solid tumors across histology. In this 200 patients, the Applicant will do every possible 
effort to enrol between 9-20 patients for the following common tumour types where NTRK fusions are 
rare:  lung  cancer,  melanoma,  colorectal  cancer  and  non-secretory  breast  cancer;  additional  adult 
patients in all other indications, including primary CNS patients with responses assessed by RANO in this 
case; the Applicant commits to submit data on at least 3-5 pediatric patients ≥12 years (the vast majority 
of patients recruited so far in STARTRK-NG are below 12 years of age, numbers of ≥12 years are based 
on the current recruitment benchmark); the Applicant will also provide data on any additional pediatric 
patients  <12  years  in  the  ongoing  STARTRK-NG  and  any  potential  new  study  (expected  22-27;  13 
patients with less than 12 years already recruited since  Dec 2017, of  those  5 are  in EU  annex  I, the 
Applicant will continue recruiting at least 15-20 children).  
The timelines are based on the observed recruitment rate in STARTRK-2 (assuming 2.85 patients per 
month, it would take a minimum of 4 years to recuit 139 patients (indeed 61 efficacy evaluable patients 
have been recruited already) plus 12 months of follow-up and additional 12 months to analyse data and 
prepare full dossier) and taking into account competitive trials and new therapies. 
An interim safety and efficacy analysis will be submit by the end of 2023 at the latest.  
The following criteria will be used to assess and communicate the lack of efficacy for a specific setting in 
the expanding pool of NTRK fusion-positive patients. Once a new or currently under-represented tumour 
type has reached the stage of ≥ 13 patients in the pool that meet the integrated statistical analysis plan 
criteria, the applicant will timely inform assessors in case of lack of efficacy observed in this tumour type. 
Lack of efficacy would be defined as less than 4 responders in a group of sequentially enrolled 13 patients 
(i.e.  ORR  <  30%).  13  is  the  patient  number  derived  from  the  STARTRK-2  study  protocol,  for  an 
enrollment  under  a  Simon  2-stage  sequential  testing  design,  which  specifies  a  13  patient  first  stage 
analysis  before  enrolling  more  patients  into  a  second  stage.  If  a  new  or  currently  underrepresented 
tumour type has not reached the stage of ≥ 13 patients in the pool that meet the integrated statistical 
analysis plan criteria, the applicant will continue the enrollment of patients with this tumour type until 
the SOB-1 deadline. The recruitment status wil be provided at the time of annual renewal. The Applicant 
also commits to share with EMA any additional efficacy analyses results that would have to be done upon 
request from any other health authority. 
The Applicant will submit a safety report in all entrectinib-treated adolescent patients from STARTRK-NG 
(CO40778) and any other study with entrectinib where adolescent patients are enrolled. The report would 
include (but not limited to) assessment on growth and development and important risks such as bone 
fractures, neurocognitive disorders, CHF and QT interval prolongation. The safety report will be submitted 
by the end of 2023. 
“Specific Obligation number 2 (SOB-2) by 31 March 2027 
In order to further characterise entrectinib magnitude of efficacy across tumours based on biomarker 
status, the MAH should submit the results from tumor genomic profiling by plasma and/or tissue when 
 
 
possible at baseline and progression together with clinical outcomes association per tumour histology for 
the patients in SOB-1” 
Objective: more precise characterisation of entrectinib magnitude of efficacy across tumours based on 
biomarker status 
The Applicant proposes to continue to collect plasma for circulating tumor DNA analysis and tumor tissue 
when medically feasible, and will use NGS to correlate the following with clinical outcomes: NTRK fusion 
status  and  partners,  concurrent  oncogenic  driver  mutations  and  concurrent  additional  alterations. 
Biomarker  associations  may  not  be  statistically  powered  for  correlation  analyses  given  the  rarity  and 
diversity  of  biomarker  alterations.  Foundation  Medicine  F1  CDx  for  tissue  samples  and  Foundation 
Medicine F1Liquid CDx for ctDNA (this platform will complete analytical validation studies in 2021, will 
be CE marked and anticipated to conform to IVDR in 2022. The Applicant  will submit those analytical 
validation  results  as  part  of  post-approval  commitment  and  plasma  samples  will  be  used  to  identify 
genomic alterations at baseline and progression when medically feasible. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed: 
The Applicant considers entrectinib to fulfil unmet need based on: 
- The high unmet medical need of patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours, as entrectinib could 
be used to treat relapsed or refractory patients with these malignancies (i.e., for which there exists no 
satisfactory method of treatment) or who are  unsuitable for existing treatment options (sensibility to 
excipients, CNS metastases). 
-  Data  demonstrating  entrectinib’s  potential  to  address  this  unmet  medical  need  and  bring  a  major 
therapeutic advantage to patients with NTRK fusion-positive tumours, irrespective of tumour type and 
inclusive of patients with CNS disease. 
- Despite CMA approval for Vitrakvi for a similar indication, a possibility to approve a second product 
under  CMA  remains  (EMA/CHMP/509951/2006,  Rev.1)  since  uncertainty  remains  with  regards  to 
Vitrakvi’s ability to fulfil the unmet medical need as more data are required to confirm efficacy, entrectinib 
can be approved under CMA as well.  
The Applicant stated that Entrectinib is a weak substrate for the P-glycoprotein drug efflux transporter 
that regulates transport across the blood–brain barrier, and that a novel “Apical ER model” and in-vivo 
brain  distribution  models  demonstrated  unequivocally  that  entrectinib  is  a  poor  P-gp  substrate  with 
greater brain penetration. 
Table 9: In vitro P-gp activity and brain penetration of entrectinib, crizotinib and 
larotrectinib 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
 
 
 
According to the Applicant, for adult and paediatric cancer patients whose solid tumours harbour 
oncogenic NTRK gene fusions, molecular therapy targeting the oncogenic proteins have demonstrated 
efficacy. The Applicant stated that entrectinib demonstrated strong clinical benefit in NTRK fusion-
positive tumor and was well tolerated. Given the positive B/R of entrectinib, the current unmet need 
(especially for drugs targeting also CNS metastases) and the fact that comprehensive data will be 
available to confirm it, the Applicant believes that the benefits to public health of immediate availability 
outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of entrectinib is N-{5-[(3,5-difluorophenyl)methyl]-1H-indazol-3-yl}-4-(4-
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-[(oxan-4-yl)amino]benzamide corresponding to the molecular formula 
C31H34F2N6O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 560.64 and the following structure: 
Figure 2: active substance structure 
 
 
 
The chemical structure of entrectinib was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, infrared 
(IR) spectroscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry and UV-Vis spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a white to off-white or pale pink powder or powder with lumps. Entrectinib is 
non-hygroscopic as confirmed by DVS isotherm analysis. Entrectinib has a non-chiral molecular 
structure. 
Entrectinib is poorly soluble in aqueous media, as the highest dose strength (200 mg) is not soluble in 
less than 250 mL water over the entire pH range of 1.2 to 6.8. Entrectinib is a free base and its 
solubility is strongly pH dependent: it exhibits higher solubility at lower pH relative to higher pH. The 
solubility of entrectinib in fed-state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) is substantially higher 
(approximately 40 times higher after 1 hour and 30 times higher after 24 hours) than in fasted-state 
simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF), which is indicative of a potential food effect. The pivotal clinical 
formulation (F2A) and the proposed commercial formulation (F06) include an acidulant (pH modifier), 
tartatic acid, in order to mitigate the effect of changes in gastric pH on clinical exposures. 
Polymorphism 
Polymorphism has been observed for entrectinib. Comprehensive screening for crystalline solid forms 
of entrectinib revealed multiple crystalline solid forms. From the discovered polymorphs, Form A was 
initially selected for further development. The relationship between these forms was established and 
described. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, 
Raman spectroscopy, temperature-controlled X-ray powder diffraction (TCXRPD), and dynamic vapor 
sorption (DVS) analysis. Single-crystal X-ray structure analyses were performed on Form A, and Form 
C. In addition, an in silico crystal structure prediction (CSP) was performed to further assess the 
polymorphic landscape of entrectinib. 
From the discovered crystalline solid forms, the solvent- and water-free crystalline Form A is the 
thermodynamically stable solid form at temperatures ≤-5 °C and Form C the stable one above 0 °C 
(enantiotropic relationship). In silico polymorph prediction confirmed the experimental finding that 
Form A and Form C are the most-stable polymorphs of entrectinib. Since the obtained energy 
difference between these two forms is within the error of calculation, the calculations do not allow to 
establish the thermodynamic relationship between Form A and Form C. 
Form A was initially chosen for development and commercialisation. However, a series of unexpected 
manufacturing issues occurred with the final process step (Step 5-A) that prevented the isolation of the 
intended polymorph (Form A). 
The Applicant decided to change the active substance polymorphic form for the product to Form C 
polymorph, and to modify the final manufacturing step from 5-A to 5-C. 
Based on the extensive characterisation studies, a detailed assessment was conducted to demonstrate 
the comparability of entrectinib Form C with entrectinib Form A. It was demonstrated that Form C is 
comparable to Form A in terms of chemical and physical properties and stability. Forms A and C were 
further compared in a bioequivalence study (BE41049) and bioequivalence of Form A and Form C in 
the finished product was demonstrated. 
 
 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in five main steps using two well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. Four chemical transformation steps (Step 1 – Step 4) are followed by 
crystallization, milling, and isolation (Step 5). 
Due to unexpected issues with Step 5-A at the proposed commercial active substance manufacturer 
(manufacturer A), the Applicant decided to modify Step 5-A into Step 5-C and transfer it to a second 
manufacturer (manufacturer B). This alternative new Step 5-C has been developed specifically for the 
isolation of Form C, which has been duly characterised in terms of intramolecular bonding and crystal 
configuration. Steps from 1 to 4 are unchanged. Newly introduced materials for Step 5-C are 
supported with adequate specifications and analytical methods. 
The Applicant intends to retain Step 5-A (Step implemented at manufacturer A that will no longer be 
used) in the dossier given that active substance Form A produced with this manufacturing process may 
be used for initial supply of the product in the EU. The proposal is to remove Step 5-A from the dossier 
and no longer use it for commercial supply, when all existing Form A active substance and finished 
product inventories have cleared from the Applicant’s supply channels). Based on the demonstrated 
bioequivalence between finished products formulated with Form A and Form C and the physico-
chemical comparability of the active substance of these two polymorphic forms, and the unmet medical 
need of the product, the CHMP has carefully considered and determined that this approach can be 
accepted. The traceability of the polymorphic form is assured as polymorphic form testing is part of the 
active substance specifications, linking this information with finished product batches under GMP 
requirements. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) for steps 1 – 5-A and step 5-C were identified. CPPs for step 5-C 
have been well defined in terms of input materials and process parameters; the relevant validation 
report confirms that the process is robust and capable to deliver Form C in a reproducible manner.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for starting materials, reagents and intermediate products (four intermediates are isolated), have been 
presented. 
The starting materials and their observed impurities, reagents, solvents, process intermediates, and 
reasonably expected reaction by-products involved in the synthesis of entrectinib have been assessed 
for genotoxic risk. The assessment included in silico evaluation (using two complementary methods 
[DEREK for Windows and Leadscope Model] in accordance with ICH M7), Ames (bacterial reverse 
mutation assay) testing, chemical reasoning, and analytical testing.  
Depending on the control strategy, compounds that were flagged positive in silico were subjected to 
further Ames testing, if necessary. If classified as known mutagens, carcinogens, or carcinogens with 
unknown mutagenic potential (Classes 1-3 in ICH M7), their entry point into the synthesis, as well as 
their fate and purge, were assessed further.  
The experimental approach used analytical data to prove the absence of genotoxic/potential genotoxic 
impurities (GTIs) at low levels (analytical batch data), as well as deliberate addition of GTIs at higher 
levels in laboratory experiments and detecting their fate in the process (“spike and purge 
experiments”). An industry standard, five category weight-of-evidence classification scheme, as 
outlined in ICH M7, was used to classify the impurities on the basis of their mutagenic and carcinogenic 
potential.  
A total of seven compounds were identified as genotoxic or potentially genotoxic, and control 
strategies for each have been developed.  
 
 
Considering the indication for entrectinib (late-stage cancer), type of treatment (nongenotoxic 
anticancer agent), and expected longest duration of treatment based on patient life expectancy (less 
than 10 years), the use of less-than-lifetime (LTL) acceptable intakes for mutagenic impurities set out 
in ICH M7 is proposed for the control of Class 2 and Class 3 impurities. The same limits were also 
conservatively used to justify the control for the only identified Class 1 impurity. According to ICH M7 a 
maximum daily intake in the active substance of 10 μg/day for an individual genotoxic impurity and 30 
μg/day for the sum of genotoxic impurities is allowed. Based on a dose of 600 mg/day of entrectinib, 
this corresponds to a limit of maximum 16 ppm for any individual genotoxic/potentially genotoxic 
impurity in the active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
A single synthesis route (Steps 1-4) for entrectinib has been used during development. The route 
proved to be robust, and reliably delivered clinical supply of entrectinib. Eventually, the same route 
was developed into the final commercial manufacturing process. 
The active substance is packed in a container which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance and colour (visual), identity (IR, 
HPLC, XRPD), water (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), palladium (ICP-
MS), organic impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 19 commercial scale batches from manufacturer A and 4 commercial scale 
batches from manufacturer B of the active substance have been provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Supportive batch analyses from numerous 
development scale batches have also been provided. 
The active substance quality target product profile (QTPP) was determined through consideration of its 
use  in  the  finished  product,  based  on  knowledge  and  understanding  of  its  physical  and  chemical 
properties.  The  CQAs  of  the  active  substance  were  derived  from  the  active  substance  quality  target 
profile.  
Stability 
Stability data from four primary commercial scale batches of active substance Form A from 
manufacturer A stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 
up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Stability data from 3 primary commercial scale batches of active substance of the Form C from 
manufacturer B stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 
up to 6 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
 
 
Additional supportive stability batches of active substance of Form A (5 batches: 4 commercial and 1 
pilot) and Form C (1 batch) from manufacturer A stored in a container closure system representative of 
that intended for the market for up to 12 months (Form C) and 36 months (Form A) under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, colour, water content, organic impurities, and 
assay (at every timepoint). Identity (physical form) by XRPD was tested after 6 months and then 
annually. Twelve-month data is presented for particle size distribution for primary stability batches 
(Form A).  
Stability studies were performed using the analytical methods that are used for release testing. The 
methods used were validated and are stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No change in physical form was observed, 
regardless of the polymorph produced by the manufacturing process, under both long-term and 
accelerated conditions. This demonstrates that both intended entrectinib polymorphs (Form A and 
Form C) are stable in the solid state. 
The stability data presented for entrectinib Form A are supportive of the stability of entrectinib Form C. 
In addition, the presented primary and supportive stability data for entrectinib Form C demonstrate the 
physical and chemical stability of this polymorph. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial batch of 
active substance Form A and Form C. No changes on assay or organic impurities were observed. 
In addition, stability of both entrectinib Form A and Form C was assessed in an open container study 
over 4 weeks at 100°C, the physical form was unchanged over this time. Solutions of entrectinib were 
prepared and heated to 40°C for 24 and 42 hours, - there was no change in purity or assay of 
entrectinib. Overall, the results demonstrate that entrectinib is very stable in the solid state and stable 
in solution at ambient temperature. 
Results on stress conditions were also provided: acid, base, oxidative, thermal. Oxidative and 
hydrolytic degradation of entrectinib was assessed by exposure of entrectinib solutions to acid, base, 
and peroxide. Thermal stability in solution was assessed by heating solutions of entrectinib to 40 °C for 
24 and 42 hours. Entrectinib remained stable under thermal (neutral pH) and acidic stress conditions. 
Entrectinib is unstable under very basic and oxidative conditions. However, the conditions under which 
degradation is observed are deemed not to be relevant for normal handling of the active substance. 
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is formulated as hard capsule in two strengths, containing either 100 mg or 200 
mg of entrectinib as active substance.  
Rozlytrek 100 mg hard capsule is a size 2 (18 mm in length), hard capsule with yellow opaque body 
and cap with ENT 100 imprinted in blue on the body. 
 
 
Rozlytrek 200 mg hard capsule is a size 0 (21.7 mm in length), hard capsule with orange opaque body 
and cap with ENT 200 imprinted in blue on the body. 
Different sizes, colour and imprint are considered sufficient to differentiate the strengths. 
The two strengths are formulation proportional. 
The proposed commercial formulation is an immediate-release hard capsule and is manufactured with 
standard excipients using conventional equipment and manufacturing processes. 
The development of the entrectinib finished product includes elements of quality-by-design (QbD) and 
risk-based methodology. The quality target product profile (QTPP) has been used as the basis of design 
for the development of the finished product. The formulation was designed to achieve all of the 
attributes in the QTPP [immediate-release capsules for oral, 600 mg QD administration with or without 
food, in 2 dose strengths (100 mg and 200 mg), using entrectinib of polymorphic Form A or Form C as 
active substance with excipients compliant with Pharmacopoeial standards or respective standards for 
colourants/food additives, complying with product attributes for appearance, identity, content, 
uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, microbial limits, impurities, packaged in HDPE bottles with 
desiccant and child resistant closure, with a shelf life of minimum 24 months at or below 30 °C]. After 
definition of the commercial formulation, potential critical quality attributes (pCQAs) were identified for 
the proposed commercial formulation of the finished product, derived from the QTTP and prior 
knowledge. 
Following a risk-based assessment, a subset of CQAs were identified as potentially being impacted by 
the manufacturing process variables and, therefore, were investigated in development studies.  
Guided by an initial risk assessment, appropriate one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and multivariate studies 
were designed to evaluate the significance of process parameters and material attributes on the quality 
and performance of the capsule formulation.  
A quality risk assessment (QRA) process was used to identify risks to the quality of entrectinib finished 
product, to identify the material attributes (MAs) and process parameters (PPs) that could have an 
impact on the relevant pCQAs. A risk ranking system for severity (low, medium or high risk) was used 
throughout the pharmaceutical process development. Process parameters and material attributes were 
identified as potential critical process parameters (pCPPs) and potential critical material attributes 
(pCMAs), if a small or large impact on any of the CQAs was expected. These were further investigated 
in small or pilot-scale experiments, in order to better understand the manufacturing process. After 
experimentation on commercial equipment and scale, the risk assessment was updated to the final 
QRA and target and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were specified. 
Entrectinib is a poorly soluble substance in aqueous media. As discussed earlier in the report, the 
pivotal clinical formulation (F2A) and the proposed commercial formulation (F06) include an acidulant 
(pH modifier), in order to mitigate the effect of changes in gastric pH on clinical exposures. 
Polymorphic form A or form C are the intended active substance solid forms (Form A temporarily, until 
existing stock is depleted) and have been shown to be bioequivalent in the commercial formulation 
F06. The physicochemical properties of Form A and Form C active substance have been determined to 
be comparable. 
Form A was the only form used in clinical studies conducted before initial commercial registration. The 
polymorphic form (pure Form A or pure Form C) is controlled by the active substance manufacturing 
process and the active substance specification. 
As discussed under the active substance stability section, Form A and Form C have been shown to be 
stable during active substance storage (long-term, accelerated, and stress conditions in solid state). 
 
 
The active substance solid-form integrity during finished product manufacture and on storage of the 
finished product has been appropriately discussed and the likelihood of any solid-state polymorph 
conversion of Form A or Form C into each other or into other solid forms during finished product 
manufacturing is deemed to be low. 
The active substance particle size is controlled by a crystallization and milling process that produce 
material with a consistent particle size distribution in a specified range. The acceptance criteria are set 
on the final active substance to ensure material of appropriate quality for use in the entrectinib finished 
product manufacture. Milled and unmilled active substance were used in finished product (formulation 
F2A) to support RXDX-101-02 (STARTRK-2) registration-enabling Phase II study. Additionally, a 
bioavailability study (GP41341-Part 2) comparing F06 capsules manufactured using milled and 
unmilled Form A active substance was conducted. Average entrectinib plasma concentrations showed 
no apparent differences between entrectinib exposures from finished product manufactured using 
milled and unmilled active substance. The pharmacokinetic data indicates the absence of a correlation 
of in vivo exposure with active substance particle size within the ranges studied.  
The processability of milled and unmilled active substance batches with varying particle size 
distributions was acceptable. Considering the controls established in the active substance specification, 
the particle size of entrectinib is not considered to have a significant influence on the finished product 
manufacturing process and critical quality attributes of entrectinib hard capsules, 100 mg and 200 mg. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. or 
relevant standards for colourants/food additives. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report. 
Of note, acidulant tartaric acid has been included as an excipient. The rationale for its selection and 
inclusion in the formulation is discussed further in this section. 
The 200 mg strength formulation contains the colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110) where azo dye 
component is present. The Applicant explained that the colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110) was 
selected to differentiate the two capsule strengths, to minimize the risk of dosing errors. The Applicant 
considers the 100 mg capsule strength to be the strength of choice for use in paediatric patients. This 
capsule strength does not contain the colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E110), which is only present 
in the 200 mg F06 capsule strength. The Applicant has added a statement in 4.2 section of SmPC to 
clarify that “The 100 mg (size 2) capsules are recommended for paediatric patients”. Another 
statement has been added in SmPC Chapter 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use, concerning 
the risk of allergic reactions of Sunset yellow FCF (E110).  
The compatibility of entrectinib active substance with a number of excipients commonly used in solid 
oral formulations was evaluated. Binary mixtures of the active substance and excipients were prepared 
and evaluated in stability studies for any potential chemical and physical interaction. The 
excipient/active substance ratios were defined based on the excipient function and expected amount 
used in a typical formulation. The excipients evaluated did not exhibit significant incompatibility with 
entrectinib active substance. 
Entrectinib has been formulated into several immediate-release capsule formulations for clinical use. 
Formulations F1 and F2A are the two clinical formulations used in safety/efficacy clinical studies (phase 
I and phase II) until clinical data (relative bioavailability) cut-off. Formulation F06 has been used in the 
relative bioavailability and bioequivalence studies and is the proposed commercial formulation. 
The first generation of entrectinib finished product, formulation F1, developed was comprised of a dry 
blend of active substance free base and standard excipients. Since the solubility of the active 
 
 
substance is strongly pH dependent, effects of food and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on exposure were 
observed with this F1 formulation.  
For this reason, another formulation F2A was developed, where an acidifying agent was introduced to 
provide an acidic environment for rapid drug dissolution, mitigate the food and PPI effects on exposure 
observed with the F1 formulation, and afford higher solubility irrespective of the pH of the local 
environment. Entrectinib F2A 200 mg capsule batches were used to support the RXDX-101-01 
(STARTRK-1) Phase I study and RXDX-101-02 (STARTRK-2) registration-enabling Phase II study. 
A third generation of entrectinib finished product, formulation F06, was developed as the proposed 
commercial formulation. In the commercial formulation, the acidifying agent used in formulation F2A 
was replaced with a more commonly used acidulant, tartaric acid, which was shown to be the most 
chemically compatible with entrectinib among all compendial acidulants investigated.  
Capsule shells composed of HPMC were selected for the entrectinib F06 finished product, as they were 
considered more suitable than gelatin capsules for use within packaging containing a desiccant and the 
potential for incompatibility between tartaric acid and hard gelatin capsule (which can become brittle 
with a lower moisture content).  
No in vitro comparison could be conducted among the three formulations used in the clinical setting 
since they have significantly different dissolution profiles. However, the RXDX-101-15 study 
demonstrated the bioequivalence of 200 mg F2A and F06 formulations. Additionally, a bioequivalence 
study was performed demonstrating equivalence of the finished product manufactured using Form A 
and Form C of entrectinib. The commercial manufacturing process for entrectinib finished product using 
either Form A or Form C active substance is identical. 
The Applicant applied for a strength biowaiver for the formulation F06 100 mg strength. However, the 
use of T2EQ test initially used to decide upon similar dissolution profiles was considered not 
acceptable. The presented data showed differences in dissolution profiles between the two strengths, 
which had not been adequately discussed by the applicant. To be able to conclude whether the 
differences were active substance (solubility) rather than formulation related, the Applicant was asked 
to present comparative dissolution profiles at the same dose (i.e. two capsules of 100 mg versus one 
capsule of 200 mg). Two comparisons were carried out: with capsules containing Form A and Form C 
of the active substance (i.e. 2 x 100 mg vs 200 mg using entrectinib Form A and 2 x 100 mg vs 200 
mg using entrectinib Form C). 
The Applicant demonstrated that the variability in the dissolution is due to the formulation, specifically 
to the HPMC capsules, and it is not related to the solubility of the active substance. 
In order to reduce the variability, the Applicant provided different studies and analysed the impact of 
different variables. However, the comparability of the profiles of the two strengths was demonstrated 
only when a sufficient number of units was tested, and when two 100 mg capsules (in a single sinker) 
against one 200 mg capsule were tested. This was considered acceptable. 
In these conditions f2 bootstrapping demonstrated comparability in all relevant media tested 
(simulated gastric fluid sine pepsin (SGFsp) pH 1.2, sodium acetate pH 4.5, QC). 
The comparison was successful with F06 (proposed commercial formulation) capsules containing Form 
A polymorph and F06 capsules containing Form C polymorph of the active substance. 
The reason for accepting the biowaiver for 100 mg strength is also based on the comparison of 
dissolution profiles of the formulations tested in vivo (F2A and F06) and proved bioequivalent. 
 
 
A range of method conditions was assessed in order to reduce the dissolution variability: apparatus, 
rotation speed, surfactant type and sinker type. None resulted in decreased variability of the 
dissolution at earlier time points. Similar variability was observed for the different types tested. 
The dissolution profile data for various testing parameters and discriminating ability of the proposed 
dissolution method is acceptable as a quality control tool for batch release and stability testing of the 
100 mg and 200 mg proposed finished product. 
The primary packaging consists of HDPE bottles with a child-resistant, tamper-evident closure and silica 
gel  desiccant.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacture  of  entrectinib  hard  capsules  involves  conventional  pharmaceutical  technology  and 
operational steps, such as blending, dry granulation, and encapsulation. The manufacturing process for 
the two dosage strengths, 100 mg and 200 mg, is identical. The two dosage strengths have the same 
qualitative composition and proportional fill weight. 
The manufacturing process consists of several main steps: blending and screening steps, dry granulation, 
further  blending,  encapsulation  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
During manufacturing process development, potential critical process steps were evaluated. Process 
ranges and in-process controls are established to ensure a robust and reproducible manufacturing 
process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on 3 consecutive 
commercial scale batches of each strength. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description,  description  of  capsule  content,  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  content  (HPLC),  degradation 
products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (weight variation, Ph. Eur.), water content (KF, Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (HPLC) and microbial limits. 
The proposed in vitro dissolution acceptance criterion is considered adequate to control the quality of 
both formulation strengths (100 mg and 200 mg) in the light of high variability observed up to the 45-
minutes time point, which makes setting of a reliable and meaningful Q value at previous timepoints 
difficult.  
In addition, the Applicant, declared that there is no added value in stronger discriminatory power since 
both acceptance criteria can discriminate bioequivalent against not bioequivalent tested profiles.  
The justifications mentioned by the Applicant are supported also based on the following considerations. 
Ph. Eur. chapter 5.17.1 ‘Recommendations on dissolution testing’ gives recommendations for setting Q 
value of conventional-release dosage forms at 75% but this chapter is non-mandatory. According to 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017 reflection paper the acceptance criterion Q value is usually set in 
the range between 75-85% and usually the time points are 15, 30 or 45 minutes, but other time points 
 
 
may be used if justified. Indeed, if time points/Q values other than proposed in the decision tree would 
lead to discriminatory power, this is also acceptable.  
In conclusion, on the basis of the Applicant’ justification and provided data, although a specification of 
NLT 75% (Q) in 45 min would be preferable and more stringent, a single point specification with a Q 
value at a later timepoint could be considered adequate since no additional discriminatory power would 
be obtained using different acceptance criteria. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 
commercial scale batches of each strength using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, 
demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective 
PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. Although 
palladium levels were well below the ICH Q3D threshold, control is retained on the active substance 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
During the review, upon request, the Applicant performed a risk evaluation regarding the presence of 
nitrosamines applying principles outlined in the notice “Information on nitrosamines for marketing 
authorization holders” (EMA Ref. EMA/189634/2019). No risk of presence of nitrosamines was 
identified for the product Rozlytrek 100 mg and 200 mg hard capsules. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 100 mg capsules: 3 consecutive commercial scale batches using 
entrectinib Form C as active substance and 4 commercial scale and 2 pilot scale batches using 
entrectinib Form A as active substance; and for 200 mg capsules: 4 commercial scale batches using 
entrectinib Form C as active substance and 3 pilot scale batches using entrectinib Form A as active 
substance, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to 
the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
For Rozlytrek 100 mg and 200 mg capsules containing entrectinib Form A, stability data on three primary 
commercial scale batches (per strength) of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  the  medicinal product  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging equivalent to that proposed for 
marketing. Further supportive data on three commercial scale batches (per strength) of finished product 
stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
the  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. 
For Rozlytrek 100 mg and 200 mg capsules containing entrectinib Form C, stability data on three primary 
commercial scale batches (per strength) of finished product stored for up to 3 months under long term 
conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 3 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  the  medicinal product  are  identical  to 
 
 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Further 
supportive data on a commercial scale batch (200 mg strength) of finished product stored for up to 12 
months under long term conditions (30ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
All primary stability batches are of the same composition as the intended commercial finished product, 
only the imprint on the capsule shell is different. Both the primary stability batches and the intended 
commercial  batches  are  imprinted  in  blue  with  the  same  printing  ink,  however  different  imprints  are 
used. This slight difference is not expected to have any influence on the stability behavior of the capsule. 
Samples were tested for description of capsule and capsule content, assay, degradation products, water 
content, dissolution, and microbial limits. The analytical procedures used are the same as for release 
testing and are stability indicating. 
Rozlytrek  hard  capsules  were  shown  to  be  stable  under  all  storage  conditions  evaluated,  both  in  the 
primary stability program and supportive stability program. All samples met the acceptance criteria for 
the finished product. 
A study was conducted on two commercial scale batches of entrectinib hard capsules 100 mg, and two 
commercial batches of entrectinib hard capsules 200 mg, containing the active substance of polymorphic 
Form A, in the proposed commercial primary packaging to evaluate the in-use stability of the finished 
product. The daily dose of three capsules were removed from the bottle and the bottle was left open for 
3 minutes under 25C/60% RH and 30C/75% RH conditions. The procedure was repeated daily until 
approximately 20% of the original capsule fill count remained in the bottle. Analysis was performed on 
the remaining capsules. This procedure simulates how the product will be used by the patient. Per the 
procedure, the study had a duration of 35 days and 11 days for the 200 mg and 100 mg entrectinib hard 
capsules, respectively. The described in-use stability procedure was performed at the initial timepoint 
under 25°C/60% RH condition. No physical or chemical changes or microbiological contamination were 
observed during the in-use stability study. The storage conditions of the in-use study are 25°C/60% RH 
and 30°C/75% RH. 
In  line  with  the  CHMP  note  for  guidance  on  in-use  stability  testing  of  human  medicinal  products 
(CPMP/QWP/2934/99),  it  is  a  recommendation  of  the  CHMP  for  future  quality  development  that  the 
procedure  is  be  repeated  at  the  24  months  timepoint  (end-of  shelf-life)  under  25°C/60%  RH  and 
30°C/75% RH conditions and will be adapted to cover an in-use study duration (extended withdrawal 
period)  of  42  and  90  days,  respectively  for  the  100  mg  and  200  mg  formulation  strengths,  which 
correspond  to  the  longest  anticipated  treatment  durations  with  one  bottle  in  line  with  the  2nd  dose 
reduction schedules in the current label. 
The  available  in−use  stability  data,  in  combination  with  the  additional  “open  storage”  stability  data 
presented below, support the anticipated patient use of entrectinib hard capsules, 100 mg and 200 mg, 
without establishing a specific in-use shelf life. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In  addition,  one  commercial  scale  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined in  the  ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes were 
observed in any of the measured parameters (description, content per capsule of entrectinib, degradation 
products, water content, and dissolution), after direct exposure to ICH Q1B, Option 1 conditions, when 
compared to a dark control sample. It was demonstrated that entrectinib hard capsules, 100 mg and 
 
 
200 mg, are not sensitive to light. This result is consistent with the absence of light sensitivity determined 
for the active substance. 
An open storage stability study was conducted on one batch of entrectinib hard capsules 100 mg and 
200 mg. The capsules were placed on stability (25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH for 3 months) in their 
respective commercial container closure systems without the bottle cap. No discernible water uptake 
and no physical or chemical changes were observed during the open storage stability study. 
Two commercial scale batches of each strength were tested in order to support the holding time of 
Rozlytrek bulk capsules prior to primary packaging. The capsules were stored in the intended bulk 
packaging for 12 months at 30°C /75% RH. Rozlytrek hard capsules were shown to be stable under the 
storage conditions evaluated. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
The finished product containing either Form A or Form C is considered to have an equivalent stability 
based on the equivalent stability of the two polymorphs at the active substance level and the available 
stability data for the finished product manufactured with either entrectinib Form A or Form C. 
Adventitious agents 
The inactive ingredient lactose is derived from cow’s milk. The milk is sourced from healthy animals in 
the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption. No other ruminant materials, with the 
exception of calf rennet, are used in the preparation of lactose. Lactose is produced in line with the 
criteria defined in the report EMEA/CPMP/BWP/337/02 “Risk and regulatory assessment of lactose 
andother products prepared using calf rennet”. 
Shellac derived from female lac bug is used as a component of printing ink. No concerns are raised 
regarding this excipient. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
The Applicant has provided a risk assessment regarding the potential presence of nitrosamines 
concluding that the risk of nitrosamine formation is considered negligible. 
During the procedure the Applicant informed the CHMP that the proposed active substance 
manufacturer failed to reproduce the desired active substance Form A due to unexpected events and 
that the manufacturing site is not capable of further sourcing Form A. The Applicant has decided to 
change the active substance polymorphic form for the product and to use the Form C polymorph, and 
to modify the final manufacturing step of the active substance in order to assure that the desired 
polymorph is consistently produced. Substantial revision to Module 3 information has been done during 
the evaluation procedure and the revised documentation is acceptable. Based on the extensive 
characterisation studies, a detailed assessment was conducted to demonstrate the comparability of 
 
 
entrectinib Form C with entrectinib Form A. It was demonstrated that Form C is comparable to Form A 
in terms of chemical and physical properties and stability. Forms A and C were further compared in a 
clinical bioequivalence study (BE41049) and bioequivalence of Form A and Form C in the finished 
product was demonstrated. The traceability of the polymorphic form is assured as polymorphic form 
testing is part of the active substance specifications, linking this information with finished product 
batches under GMP requirements. This approach was further accepted due to the unmet medical need 
for the product. When all existing Form A active substance and finished product inventories have 
cleared from the Applicant’s supply channels, the Form A-related manufacturing steps are planned for 
removal from the registration dossier. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
The Applicant should submit new in-use stability results according to the proposed specifications 
(including microbial limit testing and physicochemical degradation). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic  (PD)  effects  of  entrectinib  and  its  major  metabolite  M5  were  assessed  through 
characterisation in vitro of their anti-proliferative activity in cell lines expressing NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, 
or ROS1 gene fusions compared to the ALK and ROS1 inhibitor Crizotinib. Additionally, entrectinib and 
M5 were tested for their ability to induce  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in fusion-positive cancer  cell 
lines. In vivo, entrectinib alone compared to or in combination with the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
inhibitor, Trametinib, was tested for its effects on tumour growth inhibition (TGI) in mouse xenograft 
models  representing  various  histologies  and  harboring  TRKs  or  ROS1  fusions  with  various  fusion 
partners.  Moreover,  entrectinib  and  M5  were  also  tested  in  mice  intracranially  injected  with  fusion-
positive cancer cells to test their anti-tumor activity in the CNS.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action 
Entrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases TRKA, 
TRKB, and TRKC, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). 
Inhibition by entrectinib of the TRK, ROS1, and ALK kinase fusion activity, leads to inhibition of 
downstream signalling pathways, including phospholipase C gamma (PLC), mitogen activated protein 
kinase (MAPK), and phospho-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), which in turn leads 
to inhibition of cell proliferation, and induction of tumor cell apoptosis.  
 
 
Genetic alterations in the form of fusion genes involving NTRK, ROS1 and ALK genes have known 
oncogenic and transforming potential. Fusion proteins may bypass the normal gene regulation which 
can lead to dominant over-expression and constitutive activation of the kinase domain and further 
resulting in activation of oncogenic downstream pathways and unconstrained cell proliferation. Such 
potentially oncogenic fusion genes appear in a multitude of tumour types with a variety of histologies 
and tissue origin. The Applicant suggests entrectinib can be used to inhibit such fusion gene driven 
oncogenic chain of events irrespective of tumour type in a histology-/tissue-independent (“agnostic”) 
indication. 
NTRK fusions have been described with over 20 gene fusion partners across a variety of tumour types 
including several paediatric tumours. Similarly, translocation of the kinase-encoding region of the 
ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase has been found to rearrange with over 10 gene fusion partners in a 
variety of tumour settings. While ROS1 fusions are infrequently found in most indications, higher 
numbers (~2%) of NSCLCs harbouring ROS1 fusion genes have been described.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
The  kinase  inhibitory  activity  of  entrectinib  was  determined  in  radiometric  kinase  assays.  Entrectinib 
inhibited TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, and ALK with IC50 values at low or sub nanomolar level (1.7, 0.1, 
0.1, 0.2, and 1.6 nM, respectively). In addition, a  major metabolite, M5, showed similar IC50  values 
(2.5, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, and 1.9 nM, respectively). The target kinases could potentially all be inhibited at a 
clinical exposure level (Cmax= 3 720 nM, fu=0.22%, ~8 nM free); (M5: 30-50% of parent, fu=0.31%).  
Binding  selectivity  of  entrectinib  was  tested  by  a  broad  kinome  screen  comprising  of  a  panel  with  a 
diverse  set  of  51  kinase  assays  containing  representative  members  of  serine-threonine  and  tyrosine 
kinase  subfamilies.  Biochemical  characterization  displayed  that  entrectinib  is  a  strong  and  selective 
inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, and ALK kinases with comparable IC50 values of 1.7, 0.1, 0.1, 
0.2, and 1.6 nM, respectively. JAK2 and ACK1 showed a selectivity of <50 (however no evidence of JAK2 
or ACK1 driven activity was obtained in the cell based anti-proliferation assay described below).  
In a panel of 160 cell lines (154 cancer cell lines of different histological type and 6 non-tumor cell lines), 
which included 4 ALCL (lymphoma anaplastic large cell) lines and one NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) 
line bearing endogenous ALK gene traslocations, entrectinib exhibited a IC50 ranged between 0.020 to 
0.081µM.  
hHigh anti-proliferative activity was reported in 7 out of 154 cancer cell lines tested, of which 6 carried 
NTRK or ALK gene fusions (IC50 0.47 – 81 nM). High anti-proliferative activity was also reported for one 
FLT3-ITD mutant cell line, MV-4-11. The latter activity described by the Applicant to be consistent with 
the high level of oncogenic addiction of this line to FLT3  and entrectinib exerting  weakly  inhibition of 
FLT3 (IC50=299 nM,150-fold selectivity to TRKA IC50=2 nM). Average IC50 of the remaining 157 cancer 
cell  lines  was  2.76  μM  (range  0.017  –  6.05  μM).  In  another  test  (Report  No.  1090429),  high  anti-
proliferative activity was reported in 16 out of 303 cancer cell lines tested (which included 39 paediatric 
cancer cell lines), all harbouring NTRK, ALK or ROS1 gene fusions except that again anti-proliferative 
activity was also observed for the FLT3-ITD mutant cell line (IC50=431.3 nM). In this latter test M5 was 
also investigated and there was a high degree of correlation between the Entrectinib and M5 IC50 values 
across all cell lines tested (n=223 cell lines, Pearson r=0.7762, p<0.0001) as well as within lines with 
qIC50s <1 µM (n=20 cell lines, Pearson r=0.8946, p<0.0001). This was confirmed in a more detailed 
comparative  cell  viability  study  in  the  KM12  cell  line  (CRC,  TPM3-NTRK1)  where  entrectinib  and  M5 
showed equivalent potency in cell viability with IC50s of 2.8 and 2.6 nM, respectively. These data suggest 
that the exposure of M5 may be relevant to the overall anti-tumor activity of entrectinib.  
 
 
In vitro characterization of anti-proliferation activity of entrectinib and other ROS1 inhibitors in a human 
NSCLC cell line, CUTO-28, which contains the TPM3-ROS1 fusion gene compared to the ROS1 inhibitor 
crizotinib and another investigational ROS1 inhibitor, ceritinib in the Phase 2 clinical trials. The cellular 
IC50 (20.1 nM) of entrectinib in CUTO-28 cells is lower than crizotinib (36.6 nM) and Ceritinib (176.6 
nM).  
Entrectinib showed significant anti-tumor activity  starting  from  3  mg/kg in two  human acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) cell line (IMS-M2 and M0-91) xenografts driven by the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene (study 
1087247).  This  effect  was  accompanied  by  inhibition  of  TRK  signaling  pathways  and  elimination  of 
residual cancer cells from the bone marrow only in IMS-M2 tumor-bearing mice.  
By using a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines transformed by NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusions with various fusion 
partners, the diversity of fusion genes tested for susceptibility to the entrectinib anti-proliferative effect 
was expanded. The use of NTRK-transformed cell lines was justified by the fact that cell lines naturally 
harboring NTRK fusion genes are rare, thereby limiting the diversity of TRK fusion proteins entrectinib 
could be tested against. Entrectinib inhibited the proliferation in all TRK-fusion driven cell lines tested, 
with IC50 values <6 nM, but not in the Ba/F3 parental line. Entrectinib also showed anti-proliferative 
activity in an engineered ROS1 fusion, ETV6-ROS1, transformed Ba/F3 line (Ba/F3-ETV6-ROS1)), with 
an IC50 of 5 nM.  
Entrectinib  completely  inhibited  phosphorylation  of  TRKA  after  treatment  of  NTRK1  fusion-dependent 
human  CRC  KM12  cells  at  concentrations  of  10  nM  and  higher,  with  concomitant  inhibition  of 
phosphorylation  of  key  downstream  transducers.  In  addition,  entrectinib  treatment  of  ROS1  fusion-
driven engineered Ba/F3 cells, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of ROS1 phosphorylation.  
No in vitro data (e.g. binding or cellular potency) supporting the choice of species (rat and dog) for the 
non-clinical pivotal safety studies was provided.  
In vivo 
The in vivo potency of entrectinib was investigated in a panel of solid and hematological xenograft tumor 
models  representing  various  histologies  harbouring  various  TRK  or  ROS1  fusion  genes  (see  Table  8). 
Overall, entrectinib treatment was studied in  eight  TRK-driven and three ROS1-driven tumor  models, 
representing eight gene fusions and six tumor types (sarcoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, 
NSCLC, CRC, glioma, and AML).

A  dose-range  study  was  carried  out  in  a  TRK  Fusion-Dependent  KM12  (TPM3-NTRK1)  CRC  xenograft 
model resulting in calculated ED50 and ED90 values of 2.35 and 6.23 mg/kg, respectively (based on data 
through Day 20, entrectinib administration PO QD Day 7-20). QD dosing and BID dosing with half-doses 
(i.e. equal total dose) showed equivalent efficacy in the KM12-Luciferase (CRC, TPM3-NTRK1) xenograft 
tumour  model.  Dose-response  was  investigated  in  several  of  the  PDX  models  with  similar  results, 
including ROS1-fusion-dependent models (see Table 8).  
Anti-tumor efficacy was correlated with inhibition of downstream signalling pathway as investigated in 
sub-cutaneous KM12-Luciferase tumour-bearing mice. A dose-dependent suppression of p-PLCg1, pAKT, 
and pS6 was observed at doses of 5 mg/kg PO BID and above with maximal inhibition achieved at 15 
mg/kg  (tumours  collected  at  3,  8,  and  12  hours  after  last  (third)  dose).  Pathway  suppression  was 
maintained through 8 hours with recovery of signalling observed by 12 hours, particularly in the distal 
pS6 PD marker. These results were consistent with dose-ranging efficacy data in KM12 xenografts where 
doses < 1 mg/kg were ineffective and doses > 10 mg/kg resulted in maximal tumour efficacy. Pathway 
suppression in consistency with anti-tumor efficacy was also observed in the IMS-M2 AML (ETV6-NTRK3) 
tumour model. Along with a dose-dependent decrease in TRK phosphorylation (Y674/675) and total TRK 
protein, the phosphorylation of TRK downstream signalling molecules, PLCg, AKT and extracellular signal-
regulated  kinase  1/2  (ERK1/2),  and  signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  3  (STAT3)  was 
 
 
substantially  reduced  upon  entrectinib  treatment,  with  no  observed  alteration  in  corresponding  total 
protein levels of PLCg, ERK1/2, and STAT3. Similar results were also obtained in the M0-91 AML (ETV6-
NTRK3) model.  
Anti-tumor  effect  at  orthotopic  sites  was  investigated  in  the  IMS-M2  (ETV6-NTRK3)  subcutaneous 
xenograft model, in which tumour cells spontaneously migrate to the bone marrow. After 3 weeks of 
treatment  QD,  no  tumour-  (i.e.  human  CD45-positive)  cells  could  be  detected  in  the  bone  marrow, 
whereas all vehicle-treated mice had a distinct tumor- (human CD45-positive) cell population.  
Finally,  the  anti-tumor  efficacy  of  entrectinib  in  intracranial  tumour  models  was  investigated  in  three 
intracranial brain orthotopic tumour models, the glioma models BNN2 and BNN4 (BCAN-NTRK1) and the 
CRC model KM12-Luciferase (TPM3-NTRK1) (see Table 9).  Tumor growth inhibition, as analysed by MRI, 
and  prolonged  survival  beyond  treatment  period  (p<0.0001)  were  shown  in  BNN2  and  BNN4  models 
treated with entrectinib, 50 mg/kg PO QD day 12-25. Entrectinib was also tested in a dose-ranging study 
using the intracranially-inoculated KM12-Luciferase tumour model.  Therein, entrectinib demonstrated 
dose-dependent anti-tumour activity, as measured by luciferase-based bioluminescence, and prolonged 
animal  survival  throughout  the  course  of  the  studywas  shown  in  the  KM12-Luciferase  model.    Full 
inhibition of increased bioluminescence was achieved only at 60 mg/kg BID, however all animals treated 
at doses above 15 mg/kg BID or 30 mg/kg QD survived through the 28-day treatment period (vehicle 
group succumbed due to tumours by day 16).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Entrectinib was screened across a panel of 293 diverse set of protein kinases, including serine-
threonine subfamilies (in addition to the kinome screen reported in the primary pharmacodynamic in 
vitro section). Entrectinib at 100 nM inhibited 6 kinases >95% (ALK, ROS1, TXK, TRKA, TRKB, and 
TRKC), 2 kinases >80% (CSF1R and JAK2), 4 kinases >60% (ITK, LTK, MuSK, and TYK2), and 18 
kinases >40%. The remaining 256 kinases showed minimal inhibition.  
In vitro screening assays investigated secondary pharmacodynamics effects of a single concentration 
(10 µM) of entrectinib and its major metabolite M5 on ligand binding to 89 targets (receptors, ion 
channels, and transporters. The results of these assays showed significant binding (≥50%) at 
concentrations far exceeding the highest clinical entrectinib and M5 plasma concentration (free 
Cmax,ss=~0.007 μM; free Cmax=~0.004 μM, respectively) by ~1400- and 2500-fold, respectively, 
against several targets (α1A, 2A, 2C; CB2; D1, D2S, D3, D5; δ (DOP); GR; sigma2; OX; H1; H2; 
kappa; M1, 4, 5; µ [MOP], PPARγ, 5-HT1B, 2A, 2B, 5a, 6, 7; sst4, COX2; L-type Ca2+ channels 
[dihydropyridine, verapamil, diltiazem, phenylalkylamine, and benzothiazepine sites], potassium 
channel hERG and sodium channel (site 2); norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, 5-HT, and choline 
transporters). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Entrectinib has been investigated for potential effects on CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
in a battery of mostly GLP compliant in vivo and in vitro studies.   
The CNS/neurobehavioral safety profile was investigated in the rat, by a modified Irwin screen carried 
out in female rats day 1 and day 14 after entrectinib treatment (0, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg/day PO, 14 
days or single dose). At 200 mg/kg/day, no effect on Day 1, slight to moderate incoordination from 
Day 7 and abnormal gait on Day 14 were observed. A NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day (Day 42 AUC0-
24=111±37.1 and Cmax=6.44±2.3) results in ~2-fold margin to recommended human dose. In addition, 
a neurobehavioral exploratory study was carried out in dog. In the 7-day repeat dose study (0, 80, 120 
mg/kg/day, PO, QD) no CNS signs were seen at 80 mg/kg (highest AUC0-24 73.9 μM·h Day 7) resulting 
in a 1.3-fold margin to clinical exposure. 
In the hERG assay, entrectinib was evaluated in stably transfected HEK293 cells at 0.05, 0.5, 1.5, 15 
M, resulting in concentration-dependent inhibition, ranging from 16% to 90% at tested concentrations 
and an IC50=0.6  (~75-fold the clinically relevant unbound fraction in plasma). Metabolite M5 was 
evaluated on hERG expressed in mammalian cells at 0.3, 1, 3, 10 M, resulting in concentration-
dependent inhibition, ranging from 0% to 50% at tested concentrations and an IC50=10.4 M, which 
is >2000 fold the clinically relevant unbound fraction in plasma (according to the Applicant, solubility 
limitations may have led to underestimation of the hERG inhibition). 
A cardiovascular (CV) GLP study was carried out in telemetered dogs (2/sex), with escalating doses PO 
at 0, 60, and 120 mg/kg (with 1-week washout), CV parameters reported from 60 minutes before to 7 
hours after treatment. No effects were observed on systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, ECG 
intervals (including QT and QTc), or body temperature at any of the doses tested; thus, the NOEL for 
cardiovascular parameters and body temperature was 120 mg/kg, with Cmax estimated to range from 
3.1 to 7.0 M (based on the Day 1 exposure data from the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study) 
resulting in ~2-4 fold exposure margins above clinical Cmax.  A non-GLP CV study was carried out in 3 
conscious telemetered female dogs, receiving a single oral administration of vehicle or 300 mg/kg 
 
 
entrectinib, 7 days apart. A slight transient increase in blood pressure from 30 minutes to 1 hour post 
dose was recorded. Body temperature increased 0.5 oC up to 2.5 hours post treatment. No notable 
changes in CV parameters in comparison to control, resulting in a NOEL at 300 mg/kg. In addition, an 
exploratory repeat-dose study in dog was carried out on female dogs (4/group), administrated PO QD 
at 80 or 120 mg/kg for 7 days followed by an 11-day recovery. Moderate increases in QT and QTcF 
intervals were noted, in 1 animal, in the recovery phase, day 8 and 9 at 120 mg/kg (Cmax 7.08 mM, 
AUC0-24=144 μM·h, ~2-fold clinical Cmax). 
The respiratory effects of entrectinib was investigated in female rats, given a single oral dose of 0, 50, 
100, or 200 mg/kg. Respiratory parameters including tidal volume, minute volume, respiratory rate, 
peak inspiratory flow, peak expiratory flow, inspiration time, expiration time, relaxation time, and Penh 
(an index of bronchoconstriction) parameters were collected using whole body plethysmography. No 
relevant effects were observed at any of the doses administered; the NOEL for respiratory function was 
200 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with entrectinib. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies for entrectinib have been 
conducted in mice, rats, and dogs. The studies were carried out primarily with oral administration, 
which is the proposed clinical route of administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis following repeated 
doses was performed in pharmacology studies in mice and in all repeated-dose toxicology studies. 
In all GLP studies [Analytical Methods and Validation Reports: 1087313, 1087318, 1087319, 1087320, 
1087321] rat and dogs plasma concentrations of entrectinib and M5 were measured using a validated 
LC-MS/MS-based bioanalytical method. The LC-MS/MS methods used in non-GLP nonclinical studies were 
either  validated  or  qualified.  Validation  work  was  performed  according  to  either  the  Organization  for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) GLP principles or US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
21 part 58 and/or in adherence  to standard  operating procedures (SOPs). The validated assays were 
considered  reliable  as  no  significant  deviations  from  GLP  principles or  SOPs  were  reported  that  could 
have a potential impact on the reliability of the validation and resulting PK/TK analysis. The fact that the 
validation of the assays was not conducted under a formal claim of GLP is considered to have no adverse 
impact on the quality of the validation of the methods, and hence on the resulting PK/TK analysis. Non-
validated LC-MS/MS methods were also developed and used for the analysis of plasma and brain samples 
for preliminary or exploratory PK studies in mice, rats, and dogs. In addition, radioactivity levels were 
measured in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples from mass balance studies in rats and dogs. For all 
validated methods the quantification range, and the intra- and inter-assay accuracy and precision (within 
±15% and ≤15% coefficient of variation [CV], respectively, and ± 20% and ≤20% CV at lower limit of 
quantification [LLOQ], respectively) are presented in the table below.

Absorption 
In vitro 
In vitro absorption study on the assessment of the bidirectional permeability in the Caco-2 cell monolayer 
model showed that entrectnib at 0.1(µM) presented an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 0.838 
(10−6 cm/s) in the absence (-) of the transporter inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) and of 1.07 10−6 cm/s in 
the presence (+) of CsA, values that were lower than the reference compound minoxidil [(-) 5.67 and 
(+) 5.25 (10−6 cm/s)] but higher than the second reference compound atenolol [(-) 0.244 and (+) 0.191 
(10−6 cm/s)]. Additionally Entrectinib exhibited an efflux ratio of 4.22 in the absence of the CsA, which 
was reduced to 0.808 in the presence of cyclosporine. Entrectinib with its moderate permeability may 
be considered a substrate of an apical efflux transporter such as P-glycoprotein.  
In  vivo  absorption  studies  Entrectinib  after  single  oral  dose  (10mg/kg),  the  intended  route  of 
administration in patients, was readily adsorbed with a low/moderate plasma clearance and large volume 
of  distribution  with  a  bioavailability  of  76%  in  mice  and  33%  in  rats.  Plasma  levels  declined  with  a 
terminal half-life of 2.94 – 3.82 hours respectively. In male dogs (10mg/kg) the maximum concentration 
has been reached approximately 2h post-dose in both plasma and blood with a mean blood-to-plasma 
radioactivity ratio of Cmax and AUC∞ approximately of 4 and 2.7 respectively, suggesting a preferential 
distribution into the blood. Oral bioavailability in dogs was 74.4% while plasma level decreased after 4.0 
after administration. Major metabolite M5 constituted 27.0% (oral) or 4.54% (IV) of the total circulating 
radioactivity in plasma in dogs and approximately 0.7 to 0.9% (oral) or 0.6 to 0.8% (intravenous) in 
male e female rats. Entrectinib and M5 pharmacokinetics data extrapolated from in vivo study on KM12- 
Luciferase  (TPM3-NTRK1)  intracranial/subcutaneous  tumours  mice  models  at  doses  repeated 
demonstrates  a  good  dose-dependent  PK/PD/efficacy  relationship.  Exposure  in  terms  of  Cmax  and 
AUC(0-24h) increasing dose approximately over the 5 to 60 mg/kg BID on both evaluation days (1 and 
8) and at > 3 mg/kg/day in the intracranial and subcutaneous model respectively. On the other hand 
the exposure (AUC(0-24h)) to M5 was found to be 8–15% on both Day 1 and 8 and approximately 9% 
to  16%  on  all  occasions,  of  that  of  entrectinib  exposure  in  the  intracranial  and  subcutaneous  model 
respectively. No marked accumulation in plasma exposure was observed neither in subcutaneous or in 
the intracranial model on Day 8 of QD or BID dosing as resulted from respective accumulation ratios for 
AUC(0-24) that ranged from 0.51 to 0.95 and 0.62 to 1.1 in the intracranial and from 0.65 to 1.4 and 
0.87 to 1.4 in the subcutaneous  model for entrectinib and M5 respectively. 
Distribution 
 
 
 
Entrectinib was extensively bound to plasma proteins in mouse, rat, dog, monkey including human, with 
high fractions bound >99% across all species. In human blood in vitro study, entrectinib and M5 at 3 µM 
showed blood-to-plasma ratios of 1.3 and 1.0, respectively with a fraction bound >99%. 
Radio-labeled entrectinib resulted widely distributed into tissues with mean Cmax occurring at either 3 
or  8  hours  postdose,  to  decline  after  this  time  but  with  moderate  levels  of  radioactivity,  168  hours 
postdose, still detectable in tissues like gland tissues. Excluding bile and urine, the highest mean Cmax 
levels were observed in liver, lungs, adrenal glands, kidneys, renal cortex, and thyroid while the lowest 
mean Cmax values included bone, testes, eyes, seminal vesicles, and epididymis.  
Brain-to-plasma AUC ratios were 0.219 and 0.315, respectively for entrectinib and M5 after single oral 
dose  of  entrectinib  20mg/kg  in  male  rats.  Additionally,  higher  brain  levels  were  observed  following 
achievements of steady-state conditions by either repeated oral doses or constant infusion confirming 
brain penetration of entrectinib in mice, rats and dogs with brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of ~0.4 
in mice, 0.6–2.5 in rats, and 1.4–2.2 in dogs at 24 hours post last oral dose.  
Following entrectinib 6mg/kg single IV dose, instead, male rats showed a brain/plasma ratio of 0.6 at 
6h post start of infusion (SOI) with a plasma and brain concentration at the same time equal to 1.4 and 
0.84 μM respectively. A further confirmation that entrectinib penetrates the BBB and is retained in the 
brain,  is  given  by  anti-tumor  activity  observed  in  tumours  residing  in  the  brain.  Summary  of 
pharmacodynamics,  pharmacokinetics  and  efficacy  data  observed  with  entrectinib  treatment  in  the 
KM12-Luc  intracranial  tumour  mouse  model  showed  that  oral  dose  of  5  mg/kg  induced  a  tumour 
inhibition of 82.1 % between 3-12 hours post dosing and an AUC0-24h of 12.3 μM·hr. 
No studies on placental passage or excretion into milk was carried out. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies performed in rat, monkey, dog, human and mouse hepatocytes, at concentration of 10 
μM, entrectinib represented the major component with approximatively moderate turnover of 44%, 
45%, 46%, 68%, 70% respectively. Concerning to the drug related materials formation in the studied 
species, M14 was most represented in rats 19%, M7 in dogs and humans with 36% and 12% 
respectively while M5 in monkeys with 16%.  Incubation of [14C]entrectinib with monkey, dog, 
human, rat, and mouse liver microsomes revealed [14C]entrectinib presence approximately from 33% 
to 79% respectively together with major radioactive peaks attributed to M5 detected in monkeys 
40.4%, in dogs 29.9% and in human 28.4%. M7 were detected in all species, prevalently in dogs 
36.5%, while M1, M3 and M13 were observed in monkey 5.05%, 5.40%, 10.6% and human 7.48%, 
1.97%, 5.74% liver microsomes respectively. Metabolite M2 was only detected in human liver 
microsomes 8.05%. M11, the major circulating components detected in human plasma (18.6%) 
together with M5 (12%) between 0-24 hours, was only observed in human hepatocytes (3%) and in 
the recombinant human UGT isoform 1A4 (3.94%). In human hepatocytes oxidative metabolism of 
entrectinib resulted mainly in N-demethylation at the piperazine (M5) 12%, oxidation at the benzylic 
position (M2) 5.5%, and combinations thereof (M1 1.8%, M3 0.5%). The formation of an N-oxide at 
the piperazine (M7) was observed to some extent 3.5%. Individually, the M5 (N-demethylation) was 
the most abundant metabolite, accounting for 12% (representing 41% of entrectinib metabolism) and 
M11 5.5% of drug related material after 120 minutes. Therefore glucuronide conjugation represented 
19% of entrectinib metabolism in human hepatocytes. Clearance values of both Entrectinib and M5 
showed concentration-dependent elimination in the selected time frame of 4 days and were estimated 
to be 20 and 9.3 μL/min/mg at the corresponding initial concentrations of 0.1 μM, 17 and 8.7 
μL/min/mg at 1 μM, and 5.8 and 3.9 μL/min/mg at 10 μM, respectively in cell culture medium of long-
term hepatocyte fibroblasts co-cultures from human. The major CYP450 isoforms involved in the 
metabolism of entrectinib were CYP3A4 (56%), CYP2C19 (79%),CYP2C9 (85%), CYP2C8 (86%) and 
CYP1A1 (90%) following incubation of entrectinib 10 μM with, 20 pmol/ml of recombinant cDNA 
 
 
expressed enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, 
40pmol/ml of CYP2C18, CYP2E1 and 0.8 mg/ml of Human Liver Microsomes (HLM), for 1 hour. After 
this period the CLintr in HLM system was about 0.26 μL/min/mg protein and the percentage remaining 
73%. Single oral dose in rats showed that M12 was the major metabolite in plasma with 90% in males 
and 46.3% in females to then decrease in both gender after 4 hours post dosage compared to 
entrectinib detected to 94%. Following IV dosing, entrectinib remained the predominant component in 
rat plasma 100% while M12 has not been detected. The difference of M12 formation between IV and 
oral dosing indicates that M12 is most likely formed in the intestine. In rat faeces, after 24-48 hours 
post PO dosing the parent remained the predominant component >70% in both sexes while after 24-
48 hours post IV dosing, M5 was the major metabolite, with 71.1% and 62.9% in male and female 
respectively. In male dogs plasma and faeces after 2 hours post single [14C]entrectinib, 10 mg/kg oral 
or 1 mg/kg IV dose, entrectinib was the major circulating component: 61.9% or 87.9% respectively. 
M5 was the major metabolite in circulation after oral dosing and exceed with 70% the parent at 6 
hours postdose. After IV dosing, M7, accounted for approximately 27% of radioactivity in plasma 
collected at 5 minutes. 
Excretion 
In rats, faecal excretion, proved to be the predominant route of elimination form from both male 
97.4%-102% and female 97.7%-99.5% while urinary excretion represented less than 1% and 2% 
after single oral and IV dosing respectively. The majority of the radioactivity was eliminated through 
faeces within 48 hours post dose. 
The total mean recovery in male dogs, as extrapolated from studies report 1087301 and 1087297 was 
85.8%  and  79.1%  through  120  hours  postdose  after  oral  and  IV  administration,  respectively.  The 
majority of the radioactivity was however eliminated within 48 hours post-dose after oral and 72 hours 
after  IV  dosing.  Faecal  excretion  was  the  predominant  route  of  elimination  from  male  dogs  after  10 
mg/Kg oral (84.6%) or 1 mg/kg IV dose (78.0%) of [14C]entrectinib. Urinary excretion represented a 
mean of 0.401% and 0.612% of the administered radioactivity after oral or IV dosing, respectively. In 
conclusion  faecal  excretion  was  the  predominant  elimination  route  for  dogs  and  rats.  No  data  was 
provided about mice excretion.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with entrectinib. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Entrectinib is a poorly water-soluble free base that exhibits polymorphism and can potentially exist in 
multiple solid forms. In a crossover study male Beagle dogs were treated orally with 60 mg/kg dose 
(dose volume 5 mL/kg)of two polymorphic forms of Entrectinib, Lot/Batch Number N0900202 (Form 1) 
and TIF19421/40E (Form 2). As declared by the Applicant, terminology was changed during 
development and Form 2 corresponded to Form A that is the only form used in clinical studies 
 
 
 
conducted before initial commercial registration. The applicant clarified that Form I corresponds to 
Form B and was only used in the toxicology studies in rats (4 week intermittent, study 1087348) and 
dogs (4 week intermittent, study 1087335). Form II corresponds to Form A, form to be used in clinical 
studies and selected for commercial manufacturing based on better chemical profile 
Differences in the 2 polymorphic forms I (B) and II (A) used do not affect the assessment of the 
toxicological studies since, no significant differences in Cmax and AUC, as well as in tmax and t1/2, 
emerged in PK study 1087279 where dogs were treated orally (single dose of 60 mg/kg) with the two 
entrectinib polymorphic forms in solution, with a one-week washout between the two treatments. The 
biocomparability of the 2 solid Forms is only valid for the dog species in which a direct comparison was 
performed. However, considering that the majority of toxicology studies, including the pivotal 13-week 
rat and dog studies, tested the Form II (A) also used in clinical trials, results from toxicology studies 
are considered reliable for extrapolation to humans. Similar plasma exposures to Entrectinib were 
observed in dogs when orally administrated in suspension (intended formulation used in toxicity 
studies) or solution to male Beagle dogs at a single dose of 30 mg/kg with two lots of Entrectinib of 
2nd and 3rd generation: CA14-0258 and CA15-0919. Moreover pharmacokinetics data indicated that, 
either with capsules or tablet, the presence of food increased the systemic exposure to entrectinib and 
markedly reduced the variability of the systemic exposure to the compound. At the single dose of 
60mg/kg as tablets, unchanged entrectinib was found to be the main component and M5 the main 
metabolite in plasma dogs, with amounts decreasing over time. The systemic exposure to entrectinib 
was approximately similar after IV or PO 10 mg/kg dose (AUCINF 44.4 and 49.7 µM·hr respectively) 
while increased considerably to 236 µM·hr, after 100 mg/kg PO dose, with an oral bioavailability 
ranged between 90% and 40%, following 10-100 mg/kg PO administration. After repeated treatment 
given twice a day for 5 days to mice at IV 10 and PO 60 mg/kg, non-compartmental and 
compartmental exposure parameters in terms of AUCs were in good agreement with the ct for tumor 
stabilisation ranged from 1.20 μM to 0.786 μM and the in vivo potency parameter from 0.193 to 0.276 
1/μM/day. With non-compartmental PK analysis evaluated after single (1st dose) and repeated (11th 
dose) 80 and 120 mg/kg bid administration to female mice, the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib have 
been confirmed to be, dose-proportional. After multiple dosing, minimal accumulation was observed on 
both Cmax and AUC(0-11). The RA (accumulation ratio) on Cmax was approximately 1.4 while on 
AUC(0-11) was 1.3 after 80 and 120 mg/kg bid dose, respectively. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single oral dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats and one dog, the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) exceeded the highest doses tested of 240 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. Decrease in 
size/number of stools at ≥120 mg/kg and decreased positional passivity at ≥60 mg/kg were observed 
in rats during the Irwin test. Increased platelets and increased phosphorus and total bilirubin in 
females were observed at 240 mg/kg. Reduced extra medullary hematopoiesis was also observed in 
spleen of male rats at the same dose.   
In dogs, minimal increase in lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase were observed.  
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
RATS 
Oral administration of etrectinib for four weeks to Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 50, 100 and 200 
mg/kg/day caused mortality in females during anesthesia for blood collection. Findings were similar to 
other animals at this dose and included incoordination, skin ulceration, bile duct epithelial vacuolation, 
and hyperplasia and macrophage accumulations in the liver and lymphoid tissues. Following 2 week 
administration at 400 mg/kg/day, dyspnea, hypoactivity and incoordination, marked hepatocellular 
vacuolation and necrosis, and severe lymphoid depletion were observed. 
Effects on CNS 
In the 4-week (2x2 intermittent dosing) study at 200 mg/kg/day, incoordination was noted starting on 
Day 6, and a modified Irwin test showed abnormal gait on day 14.  
In a second 4-week daily dose study, no CNS-related clinical signs were noted at 100 mg/kg/day up to 
24 days (due to early termination), or at doses ≤50 mg/kg/day up to 28 days.  
The same holds true for the 13-week study, where no CNS effects were seen at doses up to the 
highest dose administered (30 mg/kg/day).  
Skin changes 
Following 4-week administration with 4-week recovery scabbed areas were observed in both sexes at 
all doses tested; at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day males showed also ulcerations. In this study, no NOAEL 
was set, and the MTD was 100 mg/kg/day.  
In a second 4 week study with 2-week recovery, skin scabs/sores were noted at all dose levels, with 
severity and incidence increasing in a dose-dependent manner. These scabs/sores progressed to 
ulcerative moist lesions requiring veterinary treatment at ≥50 mg/kg. Microscopically, these skin 
lesions exhibited acanthosis, erosion/ulcer, epidermal surface exudate, hemorrhage, and/or mixed cell 
inflammation. The skin changes were reversible. The skin lesions, more severe in the female rats, 
manifested as scabs/sores and ulcerative moist lesions in some cases, coincided with decreased body 
weight and food consumption in the 100 mg/kg/day females, and correlated microscopically with 
minimal to marked acanthosis, erosion/ulcer, epidermal surface exudate, hemorrhage, and/or mixed 
cell inflammation. The skin effects were also reflected in clinical pathology changes indicative of 
inflammatory response, i.e., higher leukocyte and platelet counts, as well as serum protein changes 
(low albumin and globulin ratio, and high globulin concentration). Skin lesions resolved during the 
recovery phase. 
Dose-related skin lesions observed at ≥7.5 mg/kg/day after 13-week administration, manifested as 
scabs/sores (manifested only in females at the 7.5 mg/kg), and ulcerative dermatitis typically on the 
head, shoulder, and/or cervical region; correlated microscopically with acanthosis, erosion/ulcer, 
epidermal surface exudate, serocellular crust, hemorrhage, and/or mixed cell inflammation. The skin 
alterations became dose-limiting and resulted in early sacrifices at the higher doses. However, these 
resolved upon dosing suspension. 
In light of the findings shown above, skin lesions at 15 or 30 mg/kg/day were considered adverse, and 
7.5 mg/kg/day was the NOAEL (Day 91: Cmax M/F=0.63/0.63 µM; AUC0-24=5.98/6.71 µM.hr).  
Corneal findings  
In a 4-week plus 4-week recovery corneal findings, namely opacity area/s either mono- or bilateral, 
have been observed at the top dose with an incidence higher than expected (8 M and 7 F). Generally 
this alteration is only sporadically observed and in the vast majority of cases is monolateral. While for 
 
 
three rats (two M and one F at top dose) eye wound has been marked after blood sampling procedure 
on Day 16 and 29 – and considered as a consequence of collection from retro-orbital sinus - for the 
remaining ones an etiopathogenesis should be identified (a total of 12 rats with 8 bilateral 
involvement), according to the Applicant. Because of the central effects observed in all females and 
most males at top dose starting from mid of treatment periods and characterised by incoordination and 
abnormal gait a possibility is that rat eyes were damaged by sawdust particles when animals were 
slithering in the bedding and/or perhaps related to impaired corneal reflex, as declared by the 
Applicant.  
In the 4-weeks plus 2-week toxicity study, corneal findings (abrasion or white multifocal deposits, 
unilateral) were noted in two males and one female at ≥50 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 M/F=34.7/49.3 
µM.hr; Cmax M/F=2.88/3.51 µM), possibly due to scratching because of skin lesions. No 
histopathological changes were associated with the ocular findings. A decrease in seminal vesicle 
weights was observed but without any microscopic correlated. 
No corneal findings were seen in the 13-week plus 8-week study in rats, nor in all toxicity studies in 
dogs.  
Clinical pathology 
In 4-week plus 4 weeks recovery, at ≥50 mg/kg/day minimal to slight reversible decrease in RBC-
related parameters with associated increases in reticulocytes was observed at the end of each 
treatment period. Minimal to slight decreases in lymphocytes were observed at the end of the second 
treatment period. Changes in the spleen included minimal to moderate lymphoid depletion, increased 
incidence and/or severity of extramedullary hematopoiesis and congestion of the red pulp. These 
changes correlated with increased spleen weights seen also at all dose levels. The increased 
extramedullary hematopoiesis was consistent with the decreased RBC parameters and increased 
reticulocytes. The lymphoid depletion correlated with decreases in lymphocytes.  
Accumulation of foamy macrophages was minimal in the mesenteric lymph of one female at 100 
mg/kg, and minimal to moderate in the spleen, mesenteric, and mandibular lymph nodes, liver, and 
periodontal tissue at 200 mg/kg/day. The macrophages showed similar morphologic characteristics in 
the various sites and were not accompanied by any signs of degeneration or inflammation. 
Minimal to slight changes in the mandibular salivary gland consisted of increased incidence/severity of 
acinar apoptosis in females ≥100 mg/kg/day and males at 200 mg/kg/day and acinar hypertrophy in 
both sexes at ≥100 mg/kg/day. 
In addition to spleen, minimal to moderate lymphoid depletion was also observed in the mandibular 
and mesenteric lymph nodes. Increased severity of foamy macrophages occurred in the lungs of 
animals given 200 mg/kg/day when compared with controls. Slight increases in the incidence and 
severity of acinar apoptosis were observed in the parotid salivary glands when compared with controls. 
Minimal to slight myositis of the diaphragm, with some myofiber necrosis/regeneration, was noted in 
both sexes at 200 mg/kg/day. This change was not observed in subsequent rodent studies with daily 
dosing for longer periods (4- and 13-week dosing). 
In a 4-week plus 2 weeks findings, administration of 50 mg/kg included decreases in RBC counts, 
hemoglobin, and hematocrit; increases in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin (MCH); increases in platelet and reticulocyte counts; and higher WBC and neutrophil 
counts. Changes in the spleen included minimal to moderate lymphoid depletion, increased.  
Clinical chemistry findings included lower albumin and albumin:globulin ratio and higher globulin. 
Minimally higher fibrinogen in females at 25 and 50 mg/kg/day on Day 29 was also consistent with an 
inflammatory response.  
 
 
The increase in spleen weights in males correlated with congestion in the red pulp and increased 
extramedullary hematopoiesis. In addition, the spleen had lymphoid depletion characterised by 
decreased diameter of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths, decreased cellularity of the marginal zone, 
and decreased cellularity of the red pulp. An observed decrease in mandibular salivary gland weights in 
25 and 50 mg/kg/day males did not have a microscopic correlate. 
Incidence and/or severity of extramedullary hematopoiesis, and congestion of the red pulp correlated 
with increased spleen weights at all dose levels. The increased extramedullary hematopoiesis was 
consistent with the decreased RBC parameters and increased reticulocytes. The lymphoid depletion 
correlated with decreases in lymphocytes. 
Additional hematology changes at 100 mg/kg/day included higher lymphocyte, monocytes, and 
basophils. In clinical chemistry, changes included higher urea nitrogen, triglycerides, calcium, inorganic 
phosphorus, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and lower chloride 
levels (males only). No histological findings correlated with the elevated liver enzymes. In the 
mandibular salivary gland, evidence of increased secretion, characterised by larger acinar cells 
containing abundant, normal-appearing secretory product, was observed. 
In the 13-week  one, at ≥15 mg/kg/day, findings in clinical pathology were limited to non-progressive 
and minor changes primarily in animals at ≥15 mg/kg/day and often increased in magnitude in the 
early sacrificed animals. Overall, these changes were consistent with an inflammatory response and 
included minimally lower RBC mass (RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, and/or hematocrit) and 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), minimally higher MCV and MCH, and mildly to 
moderately higher reticulocyte absolute counts, minimal or mild increases in leukocyte counts (WBC, 
monocyte, and neutrophil), minimally higher globulin concentration, and decreased albumin:globulin 
ratio. Minimally higher platelet count was also considered secondary to increased bone marrow 
stimulation due to the inflammatory response. These changes correlated microscopically to skin 
inflammation, extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and/or hypercellular bone marrow. The 
hypercellular bone marrow observed at ≥15 mg/kg/day was likely secondary to skin inflammation and 
increased requirement for inflammatory cells. 
Increased spleen weight in males at ≥15 mg/kg/day and females at 30 mg/kg/day correlated with 
increased extramedullary hematopoiesis.  
At 30 mg/kg/day clinical pathology changes that were considered consistent with inflammation 
included minimally higher fibrinogen concentration in males. 
All the findings were reversible or showed a trend towards reversibility.  
Lymphoid depletion was observed at ≥25 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study in spleen, and also in lymph 
nodes and thymus at ≥200 mg/kg/day in the 4-week 2x2 intermittent dosing and 14-day studies. 
Additionally, decreased bone marrow cellularity was also observed at ≥400 mg/kg in the 14-day study. 
Effects on Hepatobiliary System  
Hepatocellular findings were mainly observed in the 4-week study with 2x2 intermittent dosing and 
included dose-related increases in AST (up to 7.3-fold) and ALT (up to 17-fold) at ≥50 mg/kg/day. 
Increased bilirubin was also observed in rats at ≥50 mg/kg/day in the 4-week 2x2 intermittent dosing 
study. These serum chemistry changes correlated with increases in the incidence of hepatocellular 
vacuolation with associated necrosis/single cell necrosis, vacuolation of bile duct epithelium, and 
minimal biliary epithelial hyperplasia at ≥200 mg/kg/day.  
A minimal increase in amylase was seen in females at the end of treatment periods, in the 4 weeks 
plus 4 week recovery study.  
 
 
Slight, dose-dependent increases in AST and ALT were observed at all doses at the end of each 
treatment period, with subsequent recovery. Bilirubin levels were minimally to slightly elevated at the 
end of the first treatment period, with no dose-response relationship. Lipase levels were marginally 
increased at the end of treatment periods in a dose-independent manner.  
Minimal to moderate vacuolation of the bile duct epithelium occasionally associated with minimal bile 
duct epithelium hyperplasia was observed in all animals at 200 mg/kg/day. 
In addition, minor increases in the incidence of hepatocellular vacuolation, sometimes in association 
with single cell hepatocellular necrosis, was also observed. These changes correlated, in both sexes, 
with the increases in serum levels of ALT and AST along with gross enlargement and, in females, 
increased weight of the liver. 
In a second 4 week study, higher ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), 
and lower chloride levels (males only) were observed following administration of entrectinib 100 
mg/kg/day. Histological findings correlated with the elevated liver enzymes. 
DOGS  
CNS signs  
In dogs, CNS effects (incoordination, staggering, abnormal gait, tremors, hypoactivity, depression, 
lateral recumbency and lethargy) were considered the cause of death or early euthanasia of female 
animals given 120 mg/kg/day after 10 days of dosing in the 4-week (2x2 intermittent dosing) study.  
In the 4-week (2x2 intermittent dosing) study, CNS effects were seen at ≥60 mg/kg/day. 
Starting on Days 6 to 7, animals at 120 mg/kg/day had incoordination of hindlimbs and forelimbs, 
staggering, abnormal gait, tremors, hypoactivity and depression. these signs were particularly severe 
at the dose of 120 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24: 147-159 μM⋅h after repeated administration), so to lead to 
preterm sacrifice or mortality of the majority of females, and to interruption of the treatment at that 
dose level. 
At 60 mg/kg/day, abnormal gait or incoordination and decreased activity were observed during both 
treatment periods; in addition, slight to moderate increases in activity and/or stereotypy were 
observed during the second treatment period. 
Similar observations were also noted at 120 mg/kg/day in a 7-day exploratory study. 
The CNS signs developed from Day 7 and included incoordination of hind limbs and fore limbs, 
staggering, tremors and hypoactivity. 
No CNS effects were observed in other toxicity studies.   
Skin findings  
In a 4 week study (2x2 intermittent dosing), administration of entrectinib at the mid dose led to skin 
changes, including abrasions sometimes with ulcerations and crusts, were observed on legs, paws, and 
eyelids during the second treatment period. Histologically, these lesions were consistent with 
inflammation characterised by infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages 
together with fibroplasia, edema, and fibrin exudation. These abrasions were reversible during the 
recovery period. 
In the second 4 weeks study, at ≥15 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 M/F=2.63/2.57 µM.hr; Cmax 
M/F=0.341/0.427 µM) broken, discoloration, scabs and/or sores were noted for the skin/subcutis of 
males at ≥15 mg/kg/day and females at 15 or 30 mg/kg/day. Histologically, these correlated with 
 
 
ulcer, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, dermal fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrates and neutrophil infiltrates. 
These changes were reversible.  
In the 13 weeks at ≥7.5 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 M/F=1.93/1.81 µM.hr; Cmax M/F=0.276/0.226 µM) 
skin lesions including sores, scab/scaly skin, swollen/raised areas, discolored areas on the foot pads 
and/or interdigital space leading to limited use of right and/or left front or hindlimbs were observed. 
These clinical observations showed reversibility at the end of recovery phase. Associated microscopic 
finding in the skin included erosion/ulcer, acanthosis, and/or acute or mixed cell inflammation. 
Hematology and clinical pathology changes 
In the 4-Week study in dogs with 2x2 Intermittent dosing schedule, in hematology, minimal to slight 
increase in platelets were present. Slight to moderate increases (up to 2.4-fold) in ALT were observed. 
Histologically, slight hepatocellular necrosis in 1 female and minimally increased severity of 
extramedullary hematopoiesis and pigmented macrophages in the liver of some females were present. 
Histopathology findings included minimal to moderate increase of pigmented macrophages in the 
spleen, most likely laden with hemosiderin (i.e. positive at Perls’ stain), and slight to marked 
congestion in the spleen. Reversible, epithelial hyperplasia in the gallbladder was noted at 30 and 120 
mg/kg/day (also with yellowish granular pigment), but was not seen in 60 mg/kg/day animals. An 
increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia was observed in treated animals. 
In the surviving animals that received 120 mg/kg/day, a minimal to slight increase in RBCs, 
hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and a decrease of reticulocyte counts were observed, followed by partial 
to complete recovery during the recovery period. A moderate to severe increase (4.3- to 29-fold for 
individual animals compared with their own pretest values) in ALT and a slight to severe increase (2- 
to 16-fold for individual animals compared with their own pretest values) in AST, ALP, GGT, and total 
bilirubin, with subsequent recovery was observed. Minimal to moderate extramedullary hematopoiesis 
and pigmented macrophages were observed microscopically in the liver and spleen; the spleen also 
exhibited slight to marked congestion at the end of recovery periods. 
At 4 weeks, clinical pathology effects were consistent with an inflammatory response in males dosed at 
≥30 mg/kg/day and females at all doses correlating with the findings in the skin and mucocutaneous 
junction of the rectum. The findings included minimal to mild increases in WBC, neutrophil and 
monocytes. In addition, increased platelet count in males at 60/45 mg/kg/day and in females at all 
dose levels was observed. Serum protein changes included mildly to moderately decreased albumin 
concentrations and mildly to markedly increased globulin concentrations in males given ≥30 
mg/kg/day and females at all dose levels, resulting in decreased albumin:globulin ratios at the same 
dose levels. 
An increase in fibrinogen was observed at all dose levels. Mildly increased cholesterol concentrations in 
animals given ≥30 mg/kg/day were also observed. 
Increased liver weights at≥30 mg/kg/day that also persisted into recovery (60/45 mg/kg/day) did not 
have correlative microscopic findings and/or any correlative clinical chemistry changes. Mildly 
increased eosinophil counts were observed in males. A mildly increased total protein concentration in 
females given 60/45 mg/kg/day was observed due to markedly increased globulin concentrations. 
Additional changes included mildly decreased calcium concentrations in females given 60/45 
mg/kg/day, which were attributed to lower albumin concentrations. 
In the 13-Week study, entrectinib administration resulted in reversible effects on clinical pathology in 
animals administered ≥7.5 mg/kg/day consistent with an inflammatory response. These included 
minimally to mildly increased WBC count, attributed to increased neutrophil count, on Days 40 and 90 
of the dosing phase in males administered ≥7.5 mg/kg/day; increased absolute monocyte count on 
 
 
Days 40 and/or 90 of the dosing phase in males administered ≥7.5 mg/kg/day and females 
administered 15 or 30 mg/kg/day; and minimally increased total protein concentration, minimally to 
mildly decreased albumin concentration, mildly increased globulin concentration, minimally to mildly 
increased fibrinogen concentration, and mildly to moderately decreased albumin:globulin ratio on Days 
40 and/or 90 of the dosing phase in males administered ≥7.5 mg/kg/day and females administered 15 
or 30 mg/kg/day. Minimally to mildly decreased calcium concentration on Days 40 and/or 90 of the 
dosing phase in animals administered ≥7.5 mg/kg/day was likely related to decreased albumin 
concentration. These hematology and clinical chemistry effects correlated with microscopic findings of 
erosion/ulceration and inflammation in the rectum and skin of foot/foot pads and aspiration-related 
inflammation in the lungs. 
Effects on Gastrointestinal Tract 
In the 4-week study, one female at 60 mg/kg was found dead on Day 9, though the cause of death 
was undetermined the female did show clinical signs of GI toxicity including abnormal (liquid, mucoid 
and/or abnormal) feces and pathology findings of erosion/ulceration at the mucocutaneous junction in 
the rectum. 
Emesis and diarrhea, sometimes associated with body weight loss and decreased food consumption, 
were observed in the, 4-week 2x2 intermittent dosing at ≥30 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 M/F=20.8/21.1 
µM.hr; Cmax M/F=1.68/1.56 µM), diarrhea and soft stool were observed sporadically. In the 4-week 
study, at ≥30 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 M/F=9.13/9.49 µM.hr; Cmax M/F=1.37/1.38 µM) liquid feces 
were noted, though at a lower incidence than in the high-dose group. At 60/45 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 
M/F=7.97/10.3 µM.hr; Cmax M/F=1.14/1.63 µM) emesis and/or liquid feces occurred at a greater 
incidence at 60/45 mg/kg/day and were considered dose-limiting at 60 mg/kg/day. 
At 15 mg/kg, microscopically, erosion/ulcer of anal squamous epithelium and/or neutrophil infiltrates in 
rectum were noted ≥15 mg/kg/day. Abnormal fecal changes associated with body weight loss and 
decrease in food consumption were considered adverse. 
At 30 mg/kg/day: (AUC0–24 M/F=8.04/7.09 µM.hr; Cmax M/F=0.912/0.839 µM) entrectinib caused 
abnormal feces (discolored [red/black] liquid/mucoid and/or non-formed feces) leading to dosing 
suspension for two animals for 3 and 6 days, respectively. There was also a correlative body weight 
loss and a decrease in food consumption.  
Additionally, GI toxicity a high incidence of vomiting and diarrhea (with correlative body weight and 
food consumption change) plus the early death of one female on Day 9, resulted in dosing suspension 
at 60 mg/kg/day (dose subsequently reduced to 45 mg/kg/day) in the 4-week daily dosing study and 
dosing suspension for individual animals administered 30 mg/kg in the 13-week study. 
QT/QTc Interval Prolongation 
In vitro, entrectinib inhibited hERG with an IC50 of 0.6 µM as a free drug, indicating a potential for 
cardiovascular risk. M5, the major human metabolite, inhibited hERG with an IC50 of ˃10 µM. 
In telemetered dogs, single dose of entrectinib up to 300 mg/kg did not have any effect on 
cardiovascular parameters including ECG intervals (see safety PD).  
In the 4-week (2x2 intermittent dosing) study, moderate prolongation of the QT/QTcF intervals was 
noted at 120 mg/kg/day (recorded on Day 11), where a Cmax of >7 µM was observed. Compared to 
the pre-dose data for individual animals, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence. Thus, the 
observed time- and dose-dependent QTc changes in females were considered entrectinib related.  
ECG evaluations conducted on Day 11 in the 120 mg/kg/day group had prolongation of ventricular 
repolarisation (QT and/or QTcF) in 2 of 5 males (QTcF mean: 29 msec) and 4 of 5 females (QTcF 
 
 
mean: 80 msec). The 4 females with increased QT/QTcF intervals were the same animals that were 
later found dead or were sacrificed on Day 13; (the Cmax ranged from 5.6 to 12.6 µM and AUC from 
115 to 250 µM.hr in these animals). 
In male treatment groups in the 4-week study, no time- or dose-dependent QTc changes were 
observed. Prolongation of QTcF interval at 4 hours postdose was noted in females at 15 (10 msec, 
4%), 30 (23 msec, 10%), or 60/45 mg/kg/day (22 msec, 9%). The QTcF interval was still prolonged 
on Day 11 of the recovery phase in one surviving 60/45 mg/kg/day female, however, QTcF intervals 
were also longer in control females during the recovery phase.  
No changes in QT/QTcF intervals were detected in the 13-week study at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day 
(Cmax = 0.9 µM) recorded on Days 40 and 90. An incidental but statistically significant finding not 
attributed to entrectinib was limited to changes in QTc interval in males. In reviewing individual heart 
rate, QT interval, and QTc interval data, no consistent trend for QT interval prolongation, relative to 
predose phase values, was noted compared with heart rate changes. In addition, no test article-related 
changes in QTc interval were observed during the dosing phase in females administered any dose 
level, in which mean exposure levels (entrectinib or M5) were similar to those seen in males. In 
addition, no relationship with dose was seen in the QTc interval changes in individual males 
administered 30 mg/kg/day. Therefore, the statistical finding for QTc interval in males administered 30 
mg/kg/day was considered incidental and not attributed to entrectinib. No rhythm abnormalities or 
qualitative ECG changes attributed to entrectinib were observed on Day 40 or 90 of the dosing phase 
or Day 55 of the recovery phase as part of the qualitative assessment of the ECGs. 
Borderline first degree atrioventricular block (PR interval ≥ 130 msec; (Tilley and Smith, 2008) was 
noted predose and approximately 2 hours postdose on Days 40 and 90 of the dosing phase in one 
animal administered 7.5 mg/kg/day. First degree atrioventricular block is a common arrhythmia in 
dogs. 
Effects on hepatobiliary system  
Findings were mainly observed in 4-week study with 2x2 intermittent dosing, mainly at doses ≥MTD. 
Increases in ALT (4.3- to 29-fold) and AST (2- to 3-fold), ALP, GGT, and total bilirubin were observed 
at 120 mg/kg/day after 10 or 11 days of dosing. Increases in ALT (up to 2.4-fold) were also observed 
at 60 mg/kg/day after 2 weeks of dosing. Microscopic findings in the liver included increased severity 
of pigmented macrophages and extramedullary hematopoiesis, minimal to slight hepatocellular 
necrosis at ≥60 mg/kg/day, and mitotic figure increase at 120 mg/kg/day. In addition, reversible 
epithelial hyperplasia in the gallbladder was noted at 30 and 120 mg/kg/day (also with yellowish 
granular pigment), but was not seen in 60 mg/kg/day animals. Increased liver weights were also 
observed in both sexes at 60/45 and 30 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study and in 30 mg/kg/day male 
dogs at the end of 13 weeks of dosing, however, no correlating clinical chemistry or histological 
findings were noted. 
Genotoxicity 
Bacterial toxicity of entrectinib was observed both in the absence and in the presence of metabolic 
activation at concentrations of ≥9.76 and ≥4.88µg/plate and at concentrations of ≥78.1 µg/plate and 
≥39 µg/plate. The results suggested that entrectinib did not induce mutations in bacteria under the 
conditions of this study. In a GLP micronucleus assay in HPBL, a statistically significant and 
concentration-related increase in the percentage of micronuclei was observed at 15 µg/mL and 
concurrent cytotoxicity of 53%, following treatment of 24 hours in the absence of S9. No statistically 
significant increases outside the historical control range were seen at any concentration, following 4 
hours of incubation (±S9). 
 
 
A follow-up experiment at 15 µg/mL (24hr/-S9) applying fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) 
analysis revealed an increase in centromere-positive micronuclei (81%), suggesting an aneugenic 
mode of action for entrectinib-induced micronucleation. 
Moreover, entrectinib was negative in the in vivo liver comet and bone marrow micronucleus assays at 
exposure levels 3.1 - and 3.9-fold (Cmax=10.8 µM; AUC0-t=242 µM.hr, respectively) above the 
anticipated human exposure (Cmaxss: 3.49 µM; AUCss: 62.8 µM.h). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted as part of the application. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Entrectinib oral administration to groups of 8 pregnant rats during the organogenesis period, led to 
reduced maternal body weight gain (without a corresponding reduction in food consumption) observed 
with the highest dose. Fetal weights were reduced at all dose levels and were statistically significant at 
100 and 200 mg/kg/day. There were no entrectinib-related external fetal malformations or variations 
at any dose level.  
In a GLP embryo-fetal development toxicity study in rats, maternal toxicity was apparent at 200 
mg/kg/day, as evidenced by adverse clinical signs, as well as lower body weight parameters and 
corresponding decreased mean food consumption generally throughout gestation. No evidence of 
maternal toxicity was noted at 12.5 and 50 mg/kg/day.  
A dosage level of 50 mg/kg/day was therefore considered to be the NOAEL for maternal toxicity, lower 
mean fetal weights were noted at 50 and 200 mg/kg/day. These fetal weight effects corresponded to 
the lower mean gravid uterine weight and increases in external and skeletal malformations at 200 
mg/kg/day, as well as the reduced fetal skeletal ossification findings at 50 and 200 mg/kg/day. Based 
on these results, a dosage level of 12.5 mg/kg/day was considered to be the NOAEL for embryo/fetal 
developmental toxicity. The corresponding maternal exposures (AUC0-24) of RXDX-101 on gestation 
day 17 at the maternal NOAEL of 50 mg/kg/day was 41.5 μM*hr, while an AUC0-24 value of 10.2 
μM*hr was observed at the embryo/fetal developmental NOAEL of 12.5 mg/kg/day. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated 
In the tolerability and TK study, repeat entrectinib dosing from PND 7 through 12, led to clinical signs 
of slight suspected dehydration and moderate reductions in body weight gains, at 50 mg/kg/day. The 
findings were shown at the top dose of 100 mg/kg/day as well, in addition to cold to touch. Based on 
these data, dose levels of 0 (Control), 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day were recommended for the dose 
range-finding toxicity study in juvenile rats. However, oral administration by gavage on PNDs 7 
through 34 exceeded the MTD at all doses in the dose range finding study. The mortality and severity 
of toxicities led to early terminations of the animals at 50 mg/kg/day (PND 21 to 22) and 75 
mg/kg/day (PND 15 and 17). 
Based on these data, dose levels of 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg/day were selected for the definitive toxicity 
study in juvenile rats. Entrectinib was tolerated in juvenile rats at 8 mg/kg/day but induced mortalities 
at 16 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for this study was hence considered to be 4 mg/kg/day, based on the 
developmental delays, clinical signs including convulsions, abnormal gait, decreased activity, tremors, 
labored breathing, prostration, low carriage, and increased respiratory rate (breathing), and effects on 
FOB and water maze at higher doses. The associated AUC0-24 values for entrectinib at 4 mg/kg/day 
 
 
were 7.48 and 6.05 µM.h on PND 7 and 2.2 and 3.1 µM.h on PND 97 for males and females, 
respectively. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The Tmax in rats ranged from 4-8h. Higher exposure levels were achieved in females (~2x) compared 
to males. Exposure generally increased in a dose-proportional manner and moderate accumulation 
(1,2-2x) was observed. In the 4w study (2x2w cycle), entrectinib levels in brain were 40% lower than 
those in plasma apart from in females at 200mg/kg/day, were comparable levels were measured. The 
human metabolite M5 was a minor component (0-13% of parent) in rat plasma. 
In dogs there were no apparent sex differences in exposure of entrectinib. The Tmax in dogs ranged 
from 1-4h at doses up to 60mg/kg/day and 11-12h at higher doses. Exposure generally increased in a 
dose-proportional manner except in the 13w study in which non-linear toxicokinetics was seen. 
Accumulation was observed, with the mean accumulation ratio ranging from approximately 2-6. When 
measured, the half-life was approximately 7h and levels of entrectinib in brain 24h after last treatment 
were approximately two-fold higher than those in plasma. Metabolite M5 was a major circulating 
component in dogs with AUC0-24 ranging from approximately 1x to 3x of entrectinib. There were no 
apparent sex differences in M5 levels. Accumulation of M5 was observed in dogs with an accumulation 
ratio ranging from 1,6 to 3,5. 
Local Tolerance  
Entrectinib was not irritating to the intact skin of New Zealand White rabbits following a single 
application of 500 mg for 4 hours. Moreover, it induced a transient irritant reaction of the eye when 
applied as a single dose of 100 mg/animal to New Zealand White rabbits for 1 hour. A complete 
reversal of these effects occurred within 7 days. 
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities 
A complete assessment of mutagenic impurities was conducted in accordance with the principles of ICH 
M7 guideline. Considering the indications for entrectinib, the acceptable levels for mutagenic impurities 
were conservatively defined based on the ICH M7 less-thanlifetime (LTL) acceptable intakes for a 
treatment duration of 1 to 10 years (i.e., 10 µg per day for individual impurities, 30 micrograms per 
day for the total of impurities). Certain impurities determined to have structural alerts using in silico 
analysis were tested in the Ames assay. No in silico report was provided.  
Based on the assay results, it was concluded that RO7278382, RO7278380, RO7278384, RO7280631, 
RO7288150, and RO7288613 were negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, as no positive 
mutagenic responses were observed with any of the tester strains in either the presence or absence of 
S9 activation.  
A 4-week rat study with neat RO7278383 was conducted to qualify a higher level of RO7278383, as 
this impurity was observed at levels between the ICH Q3A identification and qualification thresholds 
(0.10%-0.15%) in early development batches of drug substance produced with early versions of the 
drug substance manufacturing process. Oral administrations of RO7278383 at doses of 0, 0.33, or 1.0 
mg/kg/day to male and female rats (10/sex/dose group) for 4 weeks were well tolerated. No effects 
were observed at any dose tested in the study. Thus, the NOEL of RO7278383 for 4 weeks of dosing in 
rats was 1.0 mg/kg/day. 
 
 
Phototoxicity 
In an in vitro neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (3T3 NRU PT), 
entrectinib was found to have phototoxic potential by the photo irritancy factor and mean photo effect. 
This was not confirmed in the follow-up in vivo rat study in Long-Evans pigmented rats, where 
entrectinib was determined not to be phototoxic.  
However, microscopic findings in rats with or without exposure to light of neutrophil infiltrates of 
corneal stroma and single cell necrosis of the corneal epithelium at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day were 
considered entrectinib-related. Since corneal findings were observed in entrectinib-treated rats in the 
absence of UVR exposure (200 mg/kg), this finding was considered entrectinib-related. No cutaneous 
responses which could be indicative of phototoxicity, were revealed by dermal examination. Additional 
histological changes in the cornea consistent with phototoxicity, vacuolation of the corneal epithelium 
and loss of the corneal endothelium, were not observed in rats treated with entrectinib at 100 mg/kg 
with UVR exposure or 200 mg/kg/day with or without UVR exposure, further indicating that 
phototoxicity did not contribute to the entrectinib-related changes in the cornea.

2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Overall,  non-clinical  anti-tumoral  activity  of  entrectinib  was  demonstrated  in  four  in  vitro  cell-based 
model  (BCAN  -  NTRK1,  NPM  -  ALK,  EML4  –  ALK,  TEL  -  ALK)  and  six  in  vivo  (TPM3  -  NTRK1,  ETV6  - 
NTRK3, CD74 - ROS1, NPM –  ALK, EML4 - ALK) xenograft model. Protein sequencing conservation of 
NTRK  genes,  ROS1,  and  ALK  between  humans  and  animals  makes  the  mouse  the  most  appropriate 
species  to  assess  primary  pharmacodynamics  effects  of  entrectinib.  Sequence  comparisons  showed 
100%  or  near  100%  sequence  homologies  in  the  entrectinib  binding  site,  building  confidence  on  the 
theoretical validity of the selected species used for the safety validation. Although, it cannot entirely be 
excluded,  sequence  differences  outside  the  binding  region  affect  the  3D  conformation  of  the  binding 
region, the occurrence of CNS effects indicative of pharmacodynamically mediated effects together with 
the  sequence  homologies  indicates  that  entrectinib  was  pharmacologically  active  in  the  toxicology 
species. 
Biochemical characterisation displayed that entrectinib is a strong and selective inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, 
TRKC, ROS1, and ALK kinases with comparable IC50 values. Anti-proliferative activity (IC50 < 1µM) of 
entrectinib and the major active metabolite M5 was observed in vitro in 21 cancer cell lines of which five 
unique NTRK fusion cell, four unique ROS1 fusion cell lines including five ALK dysregulated cell lines, and 
NCI-H2228. Selectivity was proven in Ba/F3 cell lines transformed by NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusions 
with  various  fusion  partners:  entrectinib  was  highly  potent  in  all  TRK-fusion  driven  cell  lines  tested, 
inhibiting proliferation with IC50 values <6 nM, but not in the Ba/F3 parental line (control - IC50 >1000 
nM).  
Consistently with in vitro data, both entrectinib and M5 treatments showed potent and dose-dependent 
anti-tumor activity consistent in tumour stabilisation and regression with doses greater than 1 mg/kg. 
No in vivo studies were performed on xenograft models harbouring NTRK2 fusions that appears to be 
the less represented in NTRK solid tumour types included in clinical efficacy analysis set (54 patients): 
the majority of patients enrolled in clinical trials had NTRK3 fusions (57.4%), NTRK1 fusions were 
reported in 38.9% of patients and NTRK2 fusions were reported for 1 patient (1.9%). Although the 
most common fusion partner identified in clinical studies was ETV6-NTRK3 in 25 patients (e.g. 
mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of the salivary glands, secretory breast carcinoma), no in vivo 
study with the clinical histologies carrying the ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangement, was performed. It is 
therefore not possible to understand whether any direct concordance between non-clinical and clinical 
data in terms of tumour site, ETV6-NTRK3 fusion type, patient age, exists. No other NTRK3 fusions 
were tested in in vivo models.  
In light of the claimed site and histology independent indication, the non-clinical pharmacological data-
package is considered insufficient to extrapolate activity in all clinical TRK fusions and tumour histologies 
including  paediatric  tumours.  From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view,  entrectinib  demonstrated  response 
towards  9  TRK1,3-driven  and  3  ROS1-driven  tumour  models  (both  cell-based  and  patient-derived 
xenografts of which only 1 orthotopic model for glioma), representing 5 solid tumour types (sarcoma, 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, NSCLC, CRC, glioma) and 1 haematological tumour (AML), and 
8 gene fusions (5 TRK1,3 and 3 ROS1). An additional in vivo model, SY5Y-TRKB (TRKB overexpression) 
neuroblastoma (NB) cell line-derived xenograft was used (Iyer et al. 2016). NTRK2 was over-expressed 
and observed and high expression of full length TRKB led to activation of ligand-driven (brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) activation of TRKB phosphorylation and downstream pathway activity. There 
is interesting preclinical evidence for the use of entrectinib in the treatment of NB, particularly in patients 
with TRK, ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases alterations. However the clinical efficacy in NB remains under 
investigation  and  additional  clinical  data  are  needed,  both  as  a  single  agent  and  in  combination,  to 
 
 
determine whether entrectinib is a beneficial and tolerable therapy for NB and which subset of patients 
is most likely to benefit. 
Selectivity towards NTRK and ROS1 fusions was only assessed in vitro on a panel of a number of kinases. 
Investigation of recurrent fusion partners in tumour types where NTRK fusions are rare, did not achieve 
further insight regarding tissue or fusion partner as effect modulators.  
Although the proof of concept demonstration in relation to histology-independent indications should in 
principle  not  be  different  from  classical  approach  of  anticancer  drugs,  it  is  understood  that  it  is  not 
possible to reflect with non-clinical models the wide clinical pattern in terms of tissue environment and 
pathophysiological context including gene fusion events. This is particularly relevant for rare cancer types 
for which entrectinib is seeking approval.  
The Applicant is recommended to use the mouse Ba/F3 pro-B cell line model to further assess and clarify 
oncogenic activity of novel NTRK fusions identified in the patient samples obtained in the pivotal clinical 
studies; the aim should be to understand biochemical events in NTRK fusion samples from patients not 
achieving clinical response.  
Compared to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib and the investigational ceritinib in the Phase 2 clinical trials, 
entrectinib resulted more potent with an anti-proliferation activity IC50 of 20.1 nM. In a panel of 160 
cell lines of diverse histological origins, entrectinib exhibited a IC50 ranged between 0.020 to 0.081µM. 
In  vivo  entrectinib  caused  dose-dependent  TGI  in  a  variety  of  ROS1  and  ALK  gene  rearrangement-
positive  models  including  allografts  expressing  crizotinib-resistant  ALK  mutations.  Tumour  regression 
has been observed in both models starting from doses of 15 mg/Kg. 
Childhood  cancers  include  many  cancers  that  also  occur  in  adults.  The  anti-proliferative  activity  of 
entrectinib was tested in a panel of 303 cell lines including 39 paediatric cancer cell lines, even if the 
applicant did not specify which tumours have been taken into account to understand their frequency into 
the  paediatric  population.  Moreover  in  adult  malignancies,  TRK  fusions  have  been  detected  across  a 
broad  range  of  histologies  at  low  frequency  (less  than  1%).  Most  paediatric  cancers  have  not  been 
sufficiently evaluated to exclude the presence of TRK fusions at this prevalence (Catherine. et al., 2018) 
that could represent an important relationship with relapsed or refractory solid tumours in children.  
Additionally literature data reported that the response to entrectinib is limited in time due to acquired 
resistance  following  development  of  mutations  that  make  kinases  insensitive  to  the  treatment.  In  a 
NTRK1  Fusion-Positive  tumor  cell  brain  metastasis–mimicking  model  obtained  through  injection  of 
KM12SM cells, has been found that the NTRK1-G667C mutation caused entrectinib resistance in brain 
lesions (Akihiro et al, 2018). Moreover, LMNA-NTRK1—positive CRC from patients and the TPM3-NTRK1—
positive  colon  cancer  cell  line  KM12  acquired  entrectinib  resistance  through  acquisition  of  two  point 
mutations in the catalytic domain of NTRK1, G667 and G595R respectively (Russo et al., 2016). Based 
on  these  assumptions,  identification  of  any  biomarkers  that  would  confer  lack  of  response  in  certain 
patients is relevant (see recommendation above).  
In vitro screening assays investigated the secondary pharmacodynamic effects of a single concentration 
(10 µM) of entrectinib and its major metabolite M5 on ligand binding to 89 targets. The results of these 
assays showed significant binding (≥50%) at concentrations far exceeding the highest clinical entrectinib 
and M5 plasma concentration against several targets. 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  in  vivo,  in  dogs  and  rats  after  single  or  repeated  oral 
administration and in vitro on cells expressing the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). Entrectinib 
effects were evaluated on the cardiovascular/central nervous and respiratory systems. 
It is noted, the in vitro hERG assay, in the safety pharmacology package and reported in study 1087275, 
was carried out under non-GLP conditions. It should have been conducted according to GLP, as stated in 
 
 
ICH-S7B. However, since QT prolongation have been observed in the clinical studies, the absence of GLP 
conditions in this in vitro hERG assay does not warrant any further action. 
Pharmacokinetic 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies for entrectinib have been 
conducted in mice, rats and dogs. The studies were carried out primarily with oral administration, 
which is the proposed clinical route of administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis following repeated 
doses was performed in pharmacology studies 1090134 - 1090136 in mice and in all repeated-dose 
toxicology studies. 
In  all  GLP  studies  rat  and  dogs  plasma  concentrations  of  entrectinib  and  M5  were  measured  using  a 
validated LC-MS/MS-based bioanalytical method. The LC-MS/MS methods used in non-GLP nonclinical 
studies were either validated or qualified. The validated assays were reliable as no significant deviations 
from GLP principles or SOPs were reported that could have a potential impact on the reliability of the 
validation and resulting PK/TK analysis.  The fact  that the validation of the assays was not conducted 
under a formal claim of GLP is considered to have no adverse impact on the quality of the validation of 
the methods, and hence on the resulting PK/TK analysis. Non-validated LC-MS/MS methods were also 
developed  and  used  for  the  analysis  of  plasma  and  brain  samples  for  preliminary  or  exploratory  PK 
studies in mice, rats and dogs. In addition, radioactivity levels were measured in blood, plasma, urine, 
and  faecal  samples  from  mass  balance  studies  in  rats  and  dogs.  For  all  validated  methods  the 
quantification range, and the intra- and inter-assay accuracy and precision were within ±15% and ≤15% 
coefficient  of  variation  [CV],  respectively,  and  ±  20%  and  ≤20%  CV  at  lower  limit  of  quantification 
[LLOQ], respectively. The methods of analysis are considered as suitable for purpose. 
The absorption characteristics of entrectinib has been  adequately studied. Entrectinib was extensively 
bound to plasma proteins in animals and human. Entrectinib resulted widely distributed into tissues.  
Contrasting findings were reported on the levels of entrectinib found in the CNS (subsequently to passing 
the BBB), depending on which method that was used. In the QWBA the total radioactivity in CNS tissues 
were below the detection limit, as compared to the LC-MS/MS detection in homogenised brain tissue, 
where  entrectinib  could  be  detected  at  approximately  20%  of  plasma  exposure.  In  addition,  after 
repeated oral doses brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of entrectinib were higher at 24 hours post last 
dose  in  mice  (~0.4),  rats  (0.6–1.5),  and  dogs  (1.4-2.2),  indicating  brain  penetration  occurred  under 
steady-state  conditions.  Furthermore,  the  brain-to-plasma  entrectinib  concentration  ratio  of  0.6  was 
achieved after a 6-hour infusion of  entrectinib to  rats even  though steady state was still not reached 
demonstrating that entrectinib can penetrate CNS with low Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux effect 
at the BBB. It appears QWBA is a less adequate method for detection of BBB passage of compound when 
the establishment of plasma/brain equilibrium is slow. 
The main metabolite M11, a direct N-glucuronide conjugate only detected in man and considered inactive 
was not further studied. This is considered acceptable. 
The majority of entrectinib is eliminated as metabolites via the faecal route and urinary excretion plays 
a minor role in the elimination of [14C]entrectinib-derived radioactivity in both rat and dog. 
Toxicology 
Entrectinib-related toxicities in repeat-dose studies in adult rats and dogs, and juvenile rats were 
observed in the CNS (convulsions, abnormal gait, tremors) at ≥0.2 times the human exposures by 
Cmax at the recommended dose, skin (scabs/sores) and decreased RBC parameters at ≥0.1 times the 
human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In adult rats and dogs, effects on liver (increased 
ALT and hepatocellular necrosis) were observed at ≥0.6 times the human exposure by AUC at the 
recommended dose. In dogs, diarrhoea at ≥0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the 
 
 
recommended dose and prolongations of QT/QTc interval at ≥0.1 times the human exposure by Cmax at 
the recommended dose were also observed. 
Entrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, but 
demonstrated a potential for abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity) in cultured human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Entrectinib was not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo micronucleus 
assay in rats and did not induce DNA damage in a comet assay in rats. 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of entrectinib. 
Dedicated fertility studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the effect of entrectinib. No 
adverse effects of entrectinib on male and female reproductive organs were observed in the 
repeatdose toxicology studies in rats and dogs at approximately 2.4-fold and 0.6-fold, respectively, the 
human exposure by AUC at the recommended human dose. 
In an embryo-foetal developmental study in rats, maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and 
food consumption) and foetal malformations (including body closure defects and malformations of the 
vertebrae and ribs), were observed at 200 mg/kg/day of entrectinib which represents approximately 2-
fold the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. Dose-response dependent reduced foetal 
body weight (low, middle and high dose) and reduced skeletal ossification (middle and high dose) were 
observed at exposures equivalent to <2 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. 
In a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology study animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to day 97 
(approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood in humans). In addition to CNS effects, ptosis and 
skin effects, decreased RBC parameters and effects on growth and development were observed in the 
dosing and recovery phases including decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation (at ≥ 
4 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.1 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose). 
Deficits in neurobehavioral assessments including functional observational battery (decreased landing 
foot splay, decreased fore and hind limb grip strength that seemed to manifest later in age) and 
learning and memory (at ≥ 8mg/kg/day, approximately 0.2 times the human exposure by AUC at the 
recommended dose), and decreased femur length (at ≥ 16 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3 times the 
human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose) were observed (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
There are no available data from the use of entrectinib in pregnant women. Based on animal studies 
and its mechanism of action, entrectinib may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception methods during 
treatment and up to 5 weeks after the last dose of entrectinib. Male patients with female partners of 
childbearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment with Rozlytrek 
and for 3 months after the last dose (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC).  
The overall assessment indicated that no additional toxicity studies are required to qualify the 
impurities. 
In vitro, entrectinib was demonstrated to be phototoxic. In vivo, microscopic findings observed in the 
corneal stroma and epithelium were indicative of an entrectinib-related effect. 
Environmental risk assessment  
According to the test on Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems (OECD 
308), Entrectinib is classified as very persistent in sediment and the whole system. Moreover, 
according to OECD 305 study results, Entrectinib could meet the criteria for a (very) persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and would therefore be classified as PBT substance. Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements (see 
section 6.6 of the SmPC). 
 
 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Results from the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated that entrectinib is a strong and 
selective inhibitor activity of kinases TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, and ALK with anti-tumor potency in NTRK 
and ROS1 fusion-driven models driving tumour regressions across multiple tumours types, including 9 
TRK1,3-driven  and  3  ROS1-driven  tumour  models  (both  cell-based  and  patient-derived  xenografts  of 
which only 1 orthotopic model for glioma), representing 6 solid tumour types (sarcoma, head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma, NSCLC, CRC, glioma and neuroblastoma) and 1 haematological tumour (AML), 
and  8  gene  fusions  (5  TRK1,3  and  3  ROS1).  Selectivity  towards  NTRK  and  ROS1  fusions  was  only 
assessed in vitro on a panel of a number of kinases.  
The  Applicant  is  recommended  to  further  assess  and  clarify  oncogenic  activity  of  novel  NTRK  fusions 
identified in the patient samples obtained in the pivotal clinical studies and to understand biochemical 
events in NTRK fusion samples from patients not achieving clinical response, using the mouse Ba/F3 pro-
B cell line model. Entrectinib and M5 were highly protein-bound (>99%) and entrectinib is capable of 
penetrating the blood-brain barrier showing anti-tumor activity in multiple intracranial tumors models.  
The entrectinib toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with ICH S9 guideline. In general, 
entrectinib-related effects in repeat-dose toxicity studies either reversed fully (CNS, QT/QTcF 
prolongation, and GI) or showed a trend towards reversibility (skin, liver and hemolymphopoietic) 
following the cessation of entrectinib administration. Effects on growth and development were present 
after the recovery period in the 13-week rat juvenile toxicology study have been reflected in section 
5.3 of the SmPC and a relevant warning addressed to pregnant women and women of childbearing 
potential has been included in section 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis 
Entrectinib (and M5) concentrations were determined in human plasma and excreta using LC-MS/MS 
following protein precipitation extraction. 
Non-compartment data analysis 
Standard non-compartmental analysis was performed in all studies where rich sampling was applied. 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic analysis 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling using the GastroPlus and SimCYP software 
were utilised to integrate available in vitro nonclinical and clinical data and to support the development 
of entrectinib by assisting the interpretation of clinical studies, predict drug-drug interactions and guide 
dosing recommendations in children < 4 years of age. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
A mixed-effects modelling approach has been used to perform population pharmacokinetic (popPK) 
and population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (popPK/PD) analyses using data from three Phase 
I/II studies in 276 adult and paediatric patients with solid malignancies: STARTRK-1 (N=57), 
STARTRK-2 (N=203), and STARTRK-NG (N=16). 
A joint model capturing the PK of both entrectinib and M5 was defined as a default preferred option as 
both were highly correlated active moieties. To avoid parameter identifiability issues, it was assumed 
 
 
 
 
that all entrectinib was metabolised into M5. Allometric coefficients of 0.75 for the CL/F and 1 for the 
V/F were used.  
Absorption  
A mass-balance study RXDX-101-05 was submitted in which 7 healthy subjects were enrolled and 
received 600 mg [14C]-entrectinib. Blood samples were collected up to 144 hours post-dose, urine and 
faces were collected up to 24 hours post-dose and until subjects meet the discharge criteria. Sixty-six 
percent (66%) of Entrectinib was absorbed and data from permeability studies in Caco-2 cells and cells 
expressing P-gp transporter indicates that entrectinib is not highly permeable. Moreover, in Caco-2 
cells the efflux ratio is >2 and the addition of Cyclosporin A decreased the efflux ratio from 4.22 to 
0.808 indicating that the transport is mediated by transporters. Data from in vitro study 1088452 
showed that P-gp mediated entrectinib and M5 transport. From solubility and in vitro permeability 
assessments, entrectinib is defined as BCS Class IV. 
Following a single 600 mg oral administration of Rozlytrek to patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive 
and ROS1-positive NSCLC under fed conditions, entrectinib was rapidly absorbed reaching time-to-
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after approximately 4 to 6 hours. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, steady-state was achieved within 5 days for entrectinib with 600 mg once 
daily dosing. 
No clinically significant effect of food on entrectinib bioavailability was observed. 
Distribution 
After a single oral dose of entrectinib, the geometric mean volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 600 L, 
suggesting extensive distribution of the drug. Entrectinib demonstrated steady-state brain-to-plasma 
concentration ratios of 0.4 - 2.2 in multiple animal species (mice, rats, and dogs) at clinically relevant 
systemic exposures. Entrectinib and M5 are highly bound with plasma proteins (>99%) independent of 
drug concentrations. 
Elimination 
The main elimination route was hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 enzyme and excretion of entrectinib 
and metabolites in faeces. The terminal half-life of entrectinib in subjects volunteers estimated using 
NCA methods is approximately 20 h, while the corresponding estimated half-life of M5 is approximately 
40 h. Population PK analysis estimated apparent clearance CL/F was 19.6 L/h and 52.4 L/h for 
entrectinib and M5, respectively.  
Mass-balance 
In ADME study a total of approximately 86% radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces following 
the oral administration of a single oral dose of [14C]entrectinib to healthy male volunteers over the 
312-hour collection period (36% of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22% as M5). A mean of 
3.06% of the dose was recovered in urine and 82.9% was recovered in feces through the last 
collection interval, indicating that the main elimination pathway of entrectinib is trough metabolism.  
Metabolism 
Only 0.3% of the administered dose was retrieved in urine as parent entrectinib. When metabolite 
profiling of urine was performed, 0.6% of the dose was identified as entrectinib in urine, and most of 
 
 
the resulting material in urine was identified as metabolites. 36% of the dose was retrieved unchanged 
in faeces. 50% of the dose was found as metabolites in faeces, the most abundant was M5 (22% of 
dose), followed by M1 (14%) and M2 (9%). 
Metabolite profiling of plasma was performed in the 0-24 hours time-frame, where parent compound 
accounted for 69% of the AUC, M5 for 12% and M11 for 19%. 
Entrectinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 (~76%). Minor contributions from several other 
CYPs and UGT1A4 were estimated at <25% in total. The active metabolite M5 (formed by CYP3A4) and 
the direct N-glucuronide conjugate, M11, (formed by UGT1A4) are the two major circulating 
metabolites identified. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The oxidative metabolite M5 is pharmacologically active and is believed by the Applicant to make a 
meaningful contribution to the clinical efficacy of entrectinib.  
An effective half-life of 19-35 hours was estimated in the 600 mg F2A group when one outlier was 
removed. In the DDI study with itraconazole and rifampcin (RXDX-101-12) where a single dose of 
entrectinib was administered in the formulation F06, the exposure ratio between M5 and entrectinib 
was around 0.3, but decreased both with itraconazole and with rifampicin. In the mass-balance study 
the average ratio between M5 and entrectinib was 0.36. 
Bioequivalence 
Different formulations of entrectinib were used in clinical studies, the first one was the F1 formulation. 
This formulation was used in ALKA-372-001 study as well as in the other studies conducted in patients 
(RXDX-101-01, RXDX-101-02 and RXDX-101-03) and in healthy subjects (CA14707 and RXDX-101-
06). 
F2 formulation was used only in study CA14707, whereas formulation F2A was used in several studies, 
among which RXDX-101-01 and RXDX-101-02. F2B was used only in CA14707 and RXDX-101-03 
studies. Formulation F06 was developed as commercial formulation. 
The applicant concluded that data support that comparative bioavailability linkage has been established 
between the three principal clinical research capsule formulations (F1, F2A, and F06).  
F1 vs other formulations 
Formulation F1 was compared with F2A and F2B in parallel in Study CA14707. In this study F1 was 
used in fed/fasted conditions and always with PPI, whereas F2A and F2B were used in fed/fasted 
conditions with/without PPI.  
In fasted state with PPI, entrectinib exposure of F2A and F2B formulations were higher than the F1 
capsule (AUCinf ratio: 1.92 and 4.09 for F2A and F2B, respectively). In fed state with PPI, the 
entrectinib exposure with F1 and F2A/F2B were essentially similar (AUCinf ratio: 1.08 and 1.11, 
respectively), however the formulations do not met the criteria for bioequivalence, because in each 
case the 90% CI of the difference between treatment means lay outside the range 80–125% for one or 
more comparisons. 
No formal bioequivalence study was performed comparing formulations F1 and F2A in the fed state 
without PPI. 
 
 
However, a comparison was performed in study RXDX-101-01 in adult patients in the fed state and 
plasma exposure of entrectinib was higher following administration of the F2A formulation compared to 
the F1 formulation. On day 1 AUCinf ratio was 1.43 (90% CI 1.09-1.85) and on day 14 AUCinf ratio 
was 1.09 (90% CI 0.70-1.72). 
In RXDX-101-01 patients could take PPI or other agents impacting gastric pH, however their 
administration was not standardised and therefore the possible impact of these drugs on entrectinib 
exposure, especially in patients taken F1, could not be fully evaluated. 
The only study in which F1 was used in fed condition and without PPI was RXDX-101-06 (relative BA of 
entrectinib administered as a granule formulation versus a capsule formulation in healthy adult male).  
If compared, the exposure of F1 formulation in fed condition (with PPI) reached in study CA14707 
(Cmax 2250 nM, AUCinf 88600 nM.h) and those reached in RXDX-101-06 (Cmax 2990 nM, AUCinf 
70100 nM.h) seems to be comparable. However, the F1 formulation is clearly not bioequivalent to no 
other formulation. 
F06 vs other formulations 
The bioequivalence between formulations F06 (200 mg) and F2A (200 mg) was evaluated in Study 
RXDX-101-15, a phase I, 2-part, 2 –way crossover study, open-label. In Part 1 subjects were 
randomized to receive 600 mg of entrectinib F06 or F2A formulation in fasted state. A wash-out period 
of at least 9 days occurred between entrectinib doses. The PK parameters Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf 
were within the acceptance criteria (IC 90%: 80-125%) and can be concluded that the two 
formulations are bioequivalent. 
The Applicant conducted a relative bioavailability study (GP41048) comparing F1 and F06 capsule 
formulations in fed condition (after a light meal).

In November 2019 the Applicant informed that an alternative drug substance polymorph (Form C) was 
selected as the final solid form for commercial and clinical use. In support to this change and in 
addition to all information provided in the quality section, a relative bioavailability of the F06 capsule 
formulation containing two drug substance polymorphs (either Form A or Form C) was investigated in 
Study GP41049. The study material (Reference: 200 mg-F06 capsules using Form A, and Test: 200 
mg-F06 capsules using Form C) was produced at commercial-scale at the commercial drug product 
manufacturing site. 
Study GP41049 was a randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, two-way crossover study to 
demonstrate bioequivalence between entrectinib polymorph Forms A and C administered under fasted 
conditions in healthy male and female subjects. In each treatment period, subjects received a single 
200-mg oral dose of entrectinib while fasted. Doses of entrectinib were separated by a washout period 
of 15 days.  
Entrectinib pharmacokinetics were comparable between Form A and Form C F06 capsule formulations 
following administration of a single 200-mg entrectinib dose in fasting condition. The plasma 
concentration versus time profiles as well as the peak and total exposure parameters were similar 
between the two polymorphs. While entrectinib exposures were approximately 10% lower on average 
from Form C than Form A (Geometric LS mean ratio for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC inf were 0.9123, 
0.8954 and 0.9015, respectively), the 90% CIs of the ratio between treatment means lay within the 
range 80% to 125% for Cmax (CI: 0.8088, 1.0291), AUC0-t (CI: 0.8005, 1.0014), and AUC0-∞ (CI: 
0.8070, 1.0069) and thereby met the standard criteria for bioequivalence. Entrectinib exposures in 
Period 1 were lower on average than corresponding exposures in Period 2, which was reflected as a 
statistically significant period effect in analyses of AUC0-∞ and AUC0-t (e.g., AUC0-∞ was 
approximately 23% lower on average in Period 1 than Period 2).  
Overall variability was similar for both formulations, with geometric CV% for AUCs and Cmax ranging 
from 30.7% to 39.4% and 28.9% to 35.6%, respectively. Within-subject variability was also similar, 
with geometric CV% for AUCs and Cmax from 24.6% to 24.9% and 26.9%, respectively. 
Entrectinib exposures following single 200-mg oral doses of Forms A and C in the fasted state were 
comparable while M5 exposure was approximately 15% lower for Form C than Form A. 
Effect of PPI 
The effect of lansoprazole under fasting conditions on entrectinib F06 formulation was assessed in 
Study RXDX-101-09, an open-label, randomized, 2-period, single-dose study. On day 1 of treatment A, 
a single oral dose of 600 mg entrectinib was administered under fasted conditions alone. During 
treatment B, lansoprazole was administered once daily for 9 consecutive days (days 1 to 9) with a 
single oral dose of entrectinib co-administered on day 5. A washout of at least 10 days occurred 
between entrectinib doses in each period. 
The statistical assessments showed that entrectinib Cmax, AUClast, and AUCINF were approximately 
decreased by 23%, 25% and 25%, respectively, when entrectinib was coadministered with 
lansoprazole compared to entrectinib alone.  
Effect of food 
 
 
 
 
The effect of food was evaluated in presence of PPI co-administration (study CA14707) for the F1 
formulation and the plasma exposure was 321% higher in the fed state compared to the fasted state. 
The effect of food was evaluated for the F2A formulation (without concomitant PPI administration) in 
studies CA14707 and RXDX-101-04 and the food effect was minor with a 32% and 17%-21% higher 
AUC in the fed state in the two studies, respectively. 
The effect of high-fat meal, high-calories meal on entrectinib PK formulation F06 (600 mg dose) was 
evaluated in Study RXDX-101-15 (Part 2). The study was a 2-way crossover study and the washout 
period between the two period was 9 days. Following a single oral dose of 600 mg entrectinib F06 in 
Part 2, administration under the fasted condition and fed condition exhibited similar exposure profiles 
and entrectinib was readily absorbed with detectable entrectinib at 0.5 hour postdose. A median Tmax 
of 4 hours in the fasted state and 5 hours in the fed state was observed. Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf 
showed that food had no impact on entrectinib F06 exposure with the geometric mean ratio and 90% 
CI bound of GMR within 80-125% when entrectinib F06 was administered in a fasted state and 
following a high-fat, high-calories meal.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Dose-proportionality was assessed in the two dose-escalation studies ALKA-372-001 and STARTRK-1 (F1 
formulation).  In  ALKA  study  the  dose  proportionality  was  assessed  for  the  doses  ranging  from  100 
mg/m2 to 1600 mg/m2, administered in fasted state, and results indicate that the increase of exposure 
is not dose-proportional. The dose-proportionality assessment was performed on the dose level based 
on BSA and not on the actual dose administered to the patients, therefore patients included in the same 
cohort were administered with different doses.    
Figure 4: Dose proportionality assessment plot of AUCτ on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 18 in 
schedule A 
In STARTRK-1 subjects included in the dose level 1 (100 mg/m2) were administered with an actual dose 
of 200 mg; subjects in Dose level 2 (200 mg/m2) were administered with 300 mg, 350 mg and 400 mg 
and those in the dose level 3 (400 mg/m2) were administered with 650 mg, 700 mg, 750 mg, 800 mg 
and 900 mg (excluding three patients in which a modification of dose was necessary and therefore were 
not  included  in  the  dose  proportionality  assessment).  The  dose  proportionality  statistical  assessment 
after single and multiple dose was performed on the basis of actual dose administered to the patients. 
Results from power model indicate that no conclusion can be drawn on the dose-proportionality as the 
confidence  intervals  fell  outside  of  the  established  acceptable  bounds  due  to  observed  exposure 
variability. 
 
 
 
Table 15: Statistical assessment of dose proportionality of entrectinib (F1 formulation) 
Since data on exposure were pooled based on the dose level and not on the actual dose administered, 
the Applicant was asked to provide details on the individual exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax based 
on the actual dose administered and further discuss/justify the range of dose linearity reported in the 
SmPC. 
In order to better illustrate dose proportionality across the 100 mg to 800 mg dose range, data from 
all 10 completed healthy volunteer clinical pharmacology studies using F1, F2A and F06 formulations 
were pooled and a power model approach was used to assess the dose-proportionality. It was 
concluded that exposures were dose proportional across the dose range studied if the 90% confidence 
interval (CI) for was within the critical interval of [1ln(0.8)/ln(r), 1ln(1.25)/ln(r)], where r is dose ratio 
of highest dose to lowest dose. Nonproportionality was concluded if the 90% CI for lay entirely outside 
this interval, while 90% CI for partially within this interval was considered inconclusive. 
Statistical analyses demonstrated that exposures (pooled data) met specified criteria for dose 
proportionality under both fed and fasted conditions: the estimated power model slope parameter 
(beta) for AUCinf was close to 1.0 and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CI) fell within the 
defined critical intervals. Similar results were achieved when data were split by formulation. Although 
the F1 formulation was only tested at 600 mg, the F2A and F06 formulations were both tested at three 
separate doses (F2A: 400 mg, 600 mg, and 800 mg; F06: 100 mg, 200v, and 600 mg). Statistical 
analyses confirmed that exposures from the F06 formulation across the dose range 100 mg to 600 mg 
met specified criteria for dose proportionality under fasted conditions as the estimated beta values for 
AUCinf and Cmax were close to 1.0 and the corresponding 90% CIs fell within the defined critical interval.

Time dependency 
The time-dependency was evaluated in the STARTRK-1 study and the AUC0-24h was estimated both on 
day 1 and on day 14.  
Table 17: STARTRK-1: Summary of Geo. Mean (geoCV%) PK Parameters for Entrectinib and 
M5 by Dose Group Following a Multiple Ascending Dose of Entrectinib (Fed; Cycle 1 Day 14) 
In Study STARKTRK-2 entrectinib was administered orally on a continous daily dosing regimen at a 
dose of 600 mg once-daily in reapeted 4-week cycles. The mean accumulation ratio was 1.91 for 
entrectinib and 2.02 for M5, in line with the half-life of about 20 hours for entrectinib and 40 hours for 
M5. The popPK model estimated that the accumulation ratio for entrectinib (600 mg QD) and M5 is 
1.89 and 2.01, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
No dedicated study has been performed in subjects with impaired renal function. 
In clinical studies STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2, and STARTRK-NG 43% of enrolled patients (120 out of 
276)  had mild to moderate impairment, while no severe renal impaired subjects have been enrolled. 
In the population PK report to confirm the absence of a clinically important difference in PK among 
patients with renal dysfunction, entrectinib and M5 exposures have been compared between patients 
with mild to moderate renal impairment and all other patients with normal renal function. 
Figure 5: Median (5th and 95th percentiles) exposure in mild or moderate renal impaired 
patients (orange) vs. non-impaired patients (blue) 
High variability in systemic exposure was observed in both groups, but there were no clear differences 
between groups. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
No dedicated study has been performed in subjects with impaired hepatic function. 
In clinical studies STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2, and STARTRK-NG 20% of enrolled patients (57 out of 276)  
had mild to moderate impairment, and only 1 patient (0,3%) had severe impairment. 
In the population PK the effects of hepatic impairment through comparison of entrectinib and M5 
exposure between groups of patients with different levels of hepatic function was explored.

patients (orange) vs. non-impaired patients (blue) 
• 
Gender 
The influence of sex was not formally investigated in the population pharmacokinetic model, but 
illustrated by displaying the distribution of individual ETA for each parameter across age and sex (e.g. 
using box-and-whisker plots or equivalent). Visually a correlation does not appear apparent.  
• 
Race 
In study RXDX-101-04, both Japanese and Caucasian subjects were included, and the PK data was 
similar between the groups. Only 5 subjects included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis were 
Asian-Japanese, therefore, the influence of race was not assessed formally. 
• 
Weight 
Weight was found to influence the PK parameters in the population pharmacokinetic model. Weight 
was allometrically scaled with fixed exponents of 0.75 and 1 for clearance and distribution parameters. 
A flat dose of 600mg (using F2A formulation in fed state) was assumed to be administered to subjects 
with different body weights. A total of 500 patients were simulated for each category of the body 
weight and the predicted AUCss on Day 14 (steady state) was computed.

Elderly 
There have been no dedicated studies in elderly individuals, and the effects of age on entrectinib PK 
were not specifically tested in the clinical pharmacology program or in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Age was graphically assessed (ETA plotted against age) in the PopPK analyses, and no 
differences were observed.

Paediatric population 
The effect of entrectinib is being evaluated in children, adolescents and young adult patients in Study 
STARTRK-NG. This is a 5-part, Phase I/Ib multicenter, open-label dose escalation and expansion study 
in which Part A of the study was a dose escalation in patients with relapsed or refractory extracranial 
solid tumors, with or without molecular alterations, to determine the MTD or RP2D, PK, and safety 
profile of entrectinib. At the time of the clinical data cut-off (31-May-2018), only data from the Part A 
(16 subjects) were included in the analysis set. In Part A, all patients received entrectinib administered 
orally with F1, with food, QD, in repeated 4-week (28-day) cycles. The BSA-based dose levels were 
250, 400, 550, and 750 mg/m2, according to a dosing nomogram. While the other patients in Part A 
received entrectinib with formulation F1, 3 patients received entrectinib with the formulation F2B. The 
dose of 550 mg/m2 was defined as the MTD in this study. The Applicant performed a comparison 
between exposure reached with 550 mg/m2 in paediatrics and 600 mg flat dose in adults from 
STARTRK-1. The exposures were comparable when taking into account the difference in BSA-dosing 
between pediatrics and adults (~1.8). Based on this exploratory assessment, the assumed 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended dose in children was 300 mg/m2. Simulation exercises were performed to predict the 
dose (using F2A formulation) for the paediatric population matching the adult exposure. PopPK has 
been used with application of theory-based allometric scaling. The estimated dose of 300mg/m2 led to 
a similar predicted systemic exposure in paediatric patients compared with the predicted exposure in 
adult patients following 600 mg flat dose once daily. However, given that PK data is pivotal to support 
dosing in children, the Applicant was asked to improve the model in order to better understand the 
factor describing a different bioavailability observed in children and adults (and not related to 
formulation).    
Updated parameters estimates of the popPK model were submitted after including data from 13 
additional paediatric patients comprising 452 additional entrectinib and M5 observations.  
The PopPK estimates of the best model and the updated model are presented in Table 18

Simulated exposures in adults and in adolescents of a relevant weight and BSA were submitted in order 
to show a matching with those obtained in adults (a range that encompasses 90% of the adults when 
given 600 mg entrectinib). Simulations were performed using the recommended doses of 400 mg and 
600 mg for BSA Categories IV and V, respectively in adolescents (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The simulations are based on the Center for Control and Prevention (CDC) database. Although the 
typical values of BSA in adolescents (≥ 12 years) ranged from 1.3 m2 to 1.5 m2, in order to cover the 
lower boundary of Category IV (1.11 m2 BSA) the age range between 10 and 11 years old had to be 
included for the purpose of the simulations that were performed by 4 kg increment body weight (from 
30 to 62 kg) and by age (from 10 to 18 years). The simulated exposure in adolescents was compared 
to the exposure in adults treated with 600 mg and for all doses it is within the 5th and 95th percentile 
of exposure in adults (shade area, see figures below).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Entrectinib and M5 as perpetrators for DDI 
The in vitro studies showed that entrectinib did not reversibly inhibit the metabolism catalysed by 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 (using midazolam as the probe 
substrate) at the higher concentration tested. Entrectinib inhibited the activity of CYP3A4, using 
testosterone as the probe substrate, with an IC50 value of 2.04 μM. Value close to those reached with 
recommended dose (1.99 μM).  
Considering that entrectinib inhibits in vitro the activity of CYP3A4 with an IC50 value close to the 
Cmax value reached with the clinically relevant dose, the DDI with a CYP3A substrate (midazolam) was 
evaluated in a clinical study RXDX-101-14 as well as by PBPK modelling. 
Results from RXDX-101-14 study confirm in vivo the inhibitory effect of entrectinib on CYP3A4 with an 
increase of midazolam AUCinf by 50% after multiple dose. 
The inductive potential of entrectinib on CYP enzymes (1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 3A4) was evaluated in in vitro 
Study 1087289 and showed that treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 10 µM of 
entrectinib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4/5 enzyme activity, while entrectinib induced 
concentration dependent increases in CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 mRNA expression level, with a 
significant increases observed mainly at entrectinib concentration of 10 µM. 
Entrectinib (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 5 µM) was newly examined for its potential to induce CYP2B6 in 
primary cryopreserved human hepatocytes among three separate donors (1095573). The experiments 
appear to be of acceptable quality, and at the cut-off concentration 1.9 uM (50xCmax), no increase in 
mRNA (>2 times) was observed. The data can be used to exclude a risk for clinical induction of 
CYP2B6. 
The potential of entrectinib to induce CY3A4 was further evaluated by in vivo DDI study RXDX-101-14 
using midazolam (see above) as substrate as well as by PBPK modelling. 
Entrectinib exhibits inhibitory potential towards Pg-p and BCRP, with IC50 value close to clinically 
relevant concentration. The effect of entrectinib (F2A formulation) as inhibitor of P-gp substrate was 
further evaluated in vivo in a clinical study using Digoxin as probe drug (study RXDX-101-13). Results 
indicates that entrectinib is a weak Pgp inhibitor. The digoxin Cmax, AUClast, and AUCINF were 
approximately 28%, 19%, and 18% higher when digoxin was coadministered with entrectinib than 
digoxin alone, respectively, confirming that entrectinib is an in vivo inhibitor of Pgp.  
The ability of  entrectinib (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 μM) to inhibit human uptake transporters, 
namely, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3) was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of 
probe substrates (estradiol-17β-glucuronide [OATP1B1 and OATP1B3], metformin [OCT2], p-
aminohippurate [OAT1] or estrone-3-sulfate [OAT3]) in transporter-expressing and control HEK293 
cells in the presence of entrectinib.  
In the presence of entrectinib (0.3 to 30 μM) the transporter-dependent uptake rate of estradiol-17β-
glucuronide into OATP1B1-expressing cells was reduced from 1.71 to 0.274 pmol/mg/min (84% 
inhibition). The calculated IC50 is 6.46 μM. The inhibitory potential of entrectinib against OATP1B1 was 
further evaluated in in vitro study 1090527. The results showed that entrectinib inhibits OATP1B1b 
 
 
with IC50 values of 3.89 μM and 4.22 μM, when using rosuvastatin and pitavastatin, respectively. For 
OATP1B1, in vivo inhibition by entrectinib cannot be excluded as the in vitro IC50 values is lower than 
the cut-off used for evaluation of interaction potential in vivo. 
In in vitro study 1087486, Entrectinib was investigated over the concentration range of 0.1 – 30 μM for 
its inhibition potential against human OCT1, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP mediated transport. 
Entrectinib was shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP with IC50 values of 1.1, 
19.4 and 13.3 µM, respectively. However, these IC50 values are similar or higher than the cut-off 
value relevant for renal transporters and no evaluation in vivo is necessary. Metabolite M5 directly 
inhibited every CYP enzyme examined, however the IC50 values were greater than the cut-off for the 
metabolite M5 (0.8 µM) and no evaluation of interaction potential in vivo is necessary. 
Metabolite M5 was shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of MATE1, MATE2-K, BCRP and P-gp with IC50 
values of 0.64, 3.14, 8.35 and 10.1 µM, respectively. However, these IC50 values are similar or higher 
than the cut-off value for M5 no evaluation in vivo is necessary. No inhibition was seen in vitro for M5 
on OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP. 
Entrectinib and M5 as victim for DDI 
Entrectinib is a P-gp substrate, but not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
In vivo study RXDX-101-12 was performed in order to assess the effect of inducer/inhibitor on 
entrectinib PK. Results showed that itraconazole increased entrectinib AUCinf of 504% and Cmax of 73%, 
whereas , the presence of rifampicin, decrease entrectinib AUCinf and Cmax of about 77% and 56%, 
respectively (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
M5 does not appear to be a clinically relevant substrate for human OCT1, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, while 
M5 is likely a substrate for BCRP and P-gp. The metabolite M5 was also shown to be a substrate of 
CYP3A4. 
Systemic hormonal contraceptives 
There are no data available on the potential effect of entrectinib on systemic hormonal contraceptives. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No dedicated clinical studies investigating the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Entrectinib is a potent inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC (encoded by the 
neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [NTRK] genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3, respectively), proto-
oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS (ROS1; encoded by the gene ROS1), and anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK; encoded by the gene ALK). The major active metabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed 
similar in vitro potency and activity. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated clinical studies for primary pharmacology were submitted. 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
 
 
An exposure/efficacy analysis was conducted including data from patients enrolled in studies STARTRK-
1 and STARTRK-2. Data from ALKA study were not included in the popPK analysis due to the results of 
the cross-validation.  
The analysis was run in two separate sub-groups of patients: ROS1-positive NSCLC patients and those 
with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours. The AUCss was used as metric of exposure. 
In ROS1 positive NSCLC patient analysis, a total of 39 patients were retained in the exposure tumour 
size analysis. 33 (85%) were categorised as partial responders and were allocated to the previously 
defined 5 categories of predicted AUCss: [13.4, 50.5), [50.5, 64.6), [64.6, 81.1), [81.1, 105.3), 
[105.3, 310.2] x103 nM*h. The proportion of PR patients was neither increasing nor decreasing 
monotonically going from the lower to the higher categories of exposure. Adding CR and PR patients, 
the responders rate was equal to 87.2% (34 patients out of 39), with an exact 95%CI ranging between 
72.6% and 95.7%. The median DOR in responder ROS1+ NSCLC patients was equal to 338 days and 
the exploratory graphic provided indicate a trend to lower DOR with higher exposure in the studied 
range. The assessment of correlation between shrinkage rate (KS) and growth rate (KG) versus 
exposure (AUCss for both entrectinib and M5) was performed and showed a large inter-patient 
variability. The slope estimates for the linear model characterising the trend in KS and KG as function 
of log10(AUCss) were equal to 7.11 for log(KS) (with a 95%CI including 0 and ranging between -5.96 
and 20.2) and 1.08 for log(KG) (with a 95%CI including 0 and ranging between -0.526 and 2.68). 
Among NTRK fusion positive patient analysis, 27 (54%) patients were categorised as partial 
responders and  were allocated to the previously defined 5 categories of predicted AUCss: [13.4, 
50.5), [50.5, 64.6), [64.6, 81.1), [81.1, 105.3), [105.3, 310.2] x103 nM*h. The proportion of PR 
patients was neither increasing nor decreasing monotonically going from the lower to the higher 
categories of exposure. Adding CR and PR patients, the responders’ rate was equal to 62% (31 
patients out of 50), with an exact 95%CI ranging between 47.2% and 75.3%. The median DOR in 
responder NTRK fusion positive patients was equal to 217 days. And the exploratory graphic provided 
indicated no marked trend towards prolonged DOR with higher exposure in the studied range. 
The assessment of correlation between KS and KG and exposure showed a large inter-patient 
variability. The slope estimates for the linear model characterising the trend in KS and KG as function 
of log10(AUCss) were equal to -5.69 for log(KS) (with a 95%CI including 0 and ranging between -17.2 
and 5.84) and 0.412 for log(KG) (with a 95%CI including 0 and ranging between -2.09 and 2.91). 
Exposure-safety relationship 
An exposure-safety analysis was performed in order to evaluate the correlation between entrectinib 
concentration and QT prolongation. This relationship was evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model 
on the basis of data collected during Study RXDX-101-02, a phase II, single arm, open-label study in 
patients with solid tumors administered with 600 mg of entrectinib in a continuous daily dosing 
regimen in 4-week cycles. Since no placebo arm was foreseen in the study, the baseline QTcF values 
were used in the model. Goodness-of-fit plots were submitted, among which those referred to model 
predicted versus observed ΔQTcF. 
Logistic regressions were used to investigate the exposure-AE relationships in order to ascertain 
whether the occurrence of safety events could be attributed to the variability in entrectinib and M5 
exposure in patients from studies STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2, and STARTRK-NG. The dose range 
investigated in the analyses was from 200 mg/m2 to 400 mg/m2 BSA-dosing and 600 mg to 800 mg 
flat dose. Results from the logistic regression models indicated that a higher frequency of SAEs or of 
Grade≥3 AEs were observed at higher exposure. The relationship between AUC,ss and probability of 
occurrence of Grade≥3 AEs, and the relationship between Cmax,ss and probability of occurrence of 
SAEs, showed a higher statistical significance compared with other exposure measures. 
 
 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the bioanalytical methods are conducted in line with the relevant Guideline on method 
validation.  
The different formulations (F1, F2A, F2B and F06) were compared. Entrectinib exposure of F2A and 
F2B were higher than the F1 capsule in fasted state with PPI, whereas the exposure is similar in fed 
state with PPI, however the BE criteria were not met. No formal BE study was performed in order to 
compare the formulation F1 and F2A in the fed state without PPI. A bioequivalence study RXDX-101-15 
in fasting condition was submitted to bridge the exposure of F06 formulation (200 mg) with F2A (200 
mg) that is the formulation most used in clinical trials (as well as F1). The PK parameters Cmax, 
AUClast and AUCinf were within the acceptance criteria (IC 90%: 80-125%) and two formulations F2A 
and F06 can be considered bioequivalent.  
A relative BE study compared F06 with F1 formulation in fed condition (light meal) and the two 
formulations reached a similar exposure.  
A BE study (GP41049) was also conducted to compare F06 capsules formulation produced with active 
substance polymorph A (used in clinical trials) and the active substance polymorph C (selected as final 
solid form for commercial and clinical use). The study was conducted as requested by the relevant 
Guideline and the F06 capsules produced with the two polymorph resulted to be bioequivalent. 
Entrectinib solubility is pH dependent, therefore the formulation F1 without acidulant in gelatin 
capsules results to be very sensitive to gastric pH. In order to reduce this sensitivity and therefore the 
variability in exposure due to the gastic pH, an acidulat was added to F2A and F2B as well as in F06.  
The effect of high-fat meal on entrectinib PK formulation F06 (600 mg) was also evaluated and results 
showed that the exposure was not significantly altered by food, therefore entrectinib can be 
administered with and without food. 
The Applicant submitted a statistical analysis of dose-proportionality for F06 formulations in fed and 
fasted conditions. The proportionality was demonstrated between 100 mg and 600 mg. 
Entrectinib did not demonstrate to have a time-dependent exposure.  
The Applicant submitted a statistical analysis of dose-proportionality for F06 formulations in fed and 
fasted conditions. Entrectinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 100 mg to 600 mg. 
The population PK model estimated mean accumulation at steady-state following 600 mg once daily 
administration of entrectinib was 1.89 (±0.381) and 2.01 (±0.437) for M5.  
Entrectinib and its major active metabolite M5 are highly bound to human plasma proteins independent 
of drug concentrations. In human plasma, entrectinib and M5 had similar protein binding with >99% 
bound at a clinically relevant concentration. 
Following administration of a single dose of [14C]-labelled entrectinib, 83% radioactivity was excreted 
in faeces (36% of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22% as M5) with minimal excretion in urine 
(3%). 
Entrectinib and M5 account for approximately 73% of radioactivity in systemic circulation at Cmax, and 
approximately half of total radioactivity AUCINF. 
Inter-individual variability 
Variability in entrectinib exposure is higher in patients compared to healthy volunteers, however, 
considering  exposure from study RXDX-101-14 where patients received 600 mg entrectinib once daily 
 
 
for 15 days (Days 8 to 22) using the F06 capsule formulation in a well-controlled study, the difference 
in CV% between healthy subjects and patients is more contained.  
Special population 
No differences in entrectinib exposure were noted in patients older than 65 years and younger adults 
based on pharmacokinetic analysis. No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65  years of age. 
Negligible amounts of entrectinib and the active metabolite M5 are excreted unchanged in urine (~3% 
of the dose) indicating that renal clearance plays a minor role in the elimination of entrectinib. Based 
on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib are not significantly 
affected in renal impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. The impact of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is unknown. 
As elimination of entrectinib is predominantly through metabolism in the liver, hepatic impairment may 
increase the plasma concentration of entrectinib and/or its major active metabolite M5. Limited clinical 
data is available in patients with hepatic impairment. 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on mild 
hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
The impact of moderate to severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is 
unknown. A dedicated study of the effects of hepatic impairment on entrectinib PK is planned to be 
completed by December 2021 (see RMP). 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on age 
(4 years to 86 years), sex, race (Asian, Black and White) and body weight (32 kg to 130 kg) (see 
section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
The proposed dosing regimen in children from 4 years old was not supported because of the lack of 
sound PK data supporting it. Given the uncertainties regarding the lower bioavailability in children, the 
popPK analysis was not considered adequate to inform dose regimen decision. In addition, no 
paediatric formulation is available. 
Data obtained from population pharmacokinetic analyses show that in paediatric patients 12 years and 
older, a dose of 400 mg Rozlytrek once daily for BSA range 1.11 m2 to 1.50 m2, and a dose of 600 mg 
Rozlytrek once daily for BSA range ≥1.51 m2 results in a similar systemic exposure attained in adults 
treated with 600 mg of Rozlytrek, once daily. 
Initially the simulation of exposure (AUCss) of entrectinib and its metabolite, M5, was performed in 
subjects weighing ≥38 kg and aged ≥12 years of age. Thereafter additional simulations were provided 
for weight below 38 kg, including the ranges 30-34 kg and 34-38 kg that fall in the BSA category 1.1-
1.5 m2 and representing adolescents of 12 years with lower percentiles of weight. The simulations 
performed for adolescents in this categories of weight (within BSA 1.1-1.5 m2) also showed that the 
exposure is within those obtained in adults.  
Interactions 
Entrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of entrectinib 600 mg once daily with oral 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) in patients increased the midazolam AUC by 50% but 
reduced midazolam Cmax by 21%. Caution is advised when entrectinib is administered together with 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cisapride, cyclosporin, ergotamine, 
fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus), due to the increased risk of adverse 
drug reactions. 
In vitro data suggest that entrectinib has inhibitory potential towards P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
 
 
Co-administration of a single 600 mg dose of entrectinib with digoxin (a sensitive P-gp substrate) 
increased digoxin Cmax by 28% and AUC by 18%. The renal clearance of digoxin was similar between 
treatments of digoxin alone and digoxin co-administered with entrectinib, indicating minimal effect of 
entrectinib on renal clearance of digoxin. 
The effect of entrectinib on digoxin absorption is not considered clinically relevant, but it is unknown 
whether the effect of entrectinib may be larger on more sensitive oral P-gp substrates such as 
dabigatran etexilate. 
Inhibition of BCRP was observed in in vitro studies. The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown, 
but caution is advised when sensitive oral BCRP substrates (e.g. methotrexate, mitoxantrone, 
topotecan, lapatinib) are co-administered with entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption. 
In vitro data indicate that entrectinib has weak inhibitory potential towards OATP1B1. The clinical 
relevance of this inhibition is unknown, but caution is advised when sensitive oral OATP1B1 substrates 
(e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin repaglinide, bosentan) are co-administered with 
entrectinib, due to the risk of increased absorption. 
In vitro studies indicate that entrectinib may induce PXR regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C family and 
UGT). Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates (e.g. repaglinide, 
warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure 
It is currently unknown whether entrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives are 
advised to add a barrier method. This is particularly relevant considering the non-clinical findings (see 
sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme mediating the metabolism of entrectinib 
and formation of its major active metabolite M5. 
Co-administration of multiple oral doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single oral dose of 
entrectinib reduced entrectinib AUCinf by 77% and Cmax by 56%.  
Co-administration of entrectinib with CYP3A or P-gp inducers (including, but not limited to, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, St. John's Wort -Hypericum 
perforatum) should be avoided.  
Co-administration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single oral dose of entrectinib 
increased AUCinf by 600% and Cmax by 173% which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse 
reactions.  
Co-administration of strong and moderate CYP3A or P-gp inhibitors (including, but not limited to, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, grapefruit or Seville 
oranges) should be avoided. If concurrent use of strong or moderate inhibitors is unavoidable in adult 
patients, administration of entrectinib should be limited to 14 days and the dose should be reduced to 
100 mg once daily for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors and 200 mg once daily for use with moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors. After discontinuation of the concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the 
entrectinib dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor can be 
resumed. A wash-out period may be required for CYP3A4 inhibitors with a long half-life (see sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Although, a marked effect of inhibitory P-gp drugs on entrectinib pharmacokinetics is not expected, 
caution is advised when treatment with strong or moderate P-gp inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, 
felodipine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) are co-administered with entrectinib due to risk of increased 
entrectinib exposure. See sections 4.5 and 5.2. of the SmPC. 
 
 
Co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), lansoprazole with a single 600 mg entrectinib dose 
reduced entrectinib AUC by 25% and Cmax by 23%. 
No dose adjustments are required when entrectinib is co-administered with PPIs or other drugs that 
raise gastric pH (e.g., H2 receptor antagonists or antacids) (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Relationship between exposure response 
Because the majority of subjects included in the exposure response analysis received the same dose of 
entrectinib, it is not possible to conclude that a plateau of efficacy has been reached at the dose of 600 
mg QD. The logistic regression models for investigation of the relationship between exposure and 
adverse event indicate that the probability of an SAE or AE is higher with higher exposure. 
With regards to the exposure-QT analysis, a major drawback is that all patients in the study received 
only one dose, 600 mg QD, of entrectinib, the recommended therapeutic dose. No placebo-control, nor 
a positive control were included in the QT-assessment. In addition, time-matched baseline ECG 
recordings were not collected, which would allow for the detection of diurnal patterns in the QTc data. 
A concentration-QTcF model was developed, where both the concentration of entrectinib and the major 
metabolite, M5, were investigated in relation to QTcF. A systematic bias is observed in the Predicted 
versus Observed QTcF plots, which indicates model misspecification. The model predictions are 
negatively biased at high values which indicates that a PK/PD hysteresis is ignored (i.e. highest delta-
QTcF is not observed at Cmax).  
Therefore a specific posology recommendation is given in section 4.2 of the SmPC and a warning on 
QTc prolongation has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC (see discussion on clinical safety). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, entrectinib PK/PD profile has been characterised in adults. The dose recommendation to treat 
solid tumours expressing a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in adolescents 
aged 12 years and older is based on data from popPK analysis and is considered acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development programme of entrectinib includes the three ongoing Phase I studies ALKA 
(adults), STARTRK-1 (adults) and STARTRK-NG (paediatric) and one Phase II study STARTRK-2 
(adults). All studies included patients with NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK molecular alterations. All studies 
are ongoing.  
Within this submission, the Applicant is seeking two separate indications for entrectinib (NTRK fusion 
positive solid tumors and ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC). For each indication separately, efficacy data 
from the three adult studies were pooled and analysed collectively.  
The paediatric study STARTRK-NG was not included in the integrated efficacy analyses, and have been 
presented separately to support the activity of entrectinib in paediatric tumours with NTRK fusion. 
Efficacy data from paediatric patients treated with entrectinib via compassionate access are also 
provided as supportive information.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The selection of the entrectinib clinical dosing regimen is based principally on efficacy and safety data 
from the dose escalation of the phase STARTRK-1 study, concurrently with the first-in-human dose-
escalation study ALKA. Real-time data from the dose-escalation evaluations from each study were used 
to inform both studies. Selection of the entrectinib clinical dosing regimen in adult patients is 
supported by the clinical safety, efficacy, graphical PK/PD analysis of dose ranging data and exposure 
response analyses. Cumulatively, the overall data lead to chose for entrectinib a 600 mg once daily 
dosing. 
ALKA 
A Phase 1, dose escalation study of entrectinib (RXDX-101) in adult patients with advanced/ 
metastatic solid tumours (ALKA-372-001) 
Methods  
Study participants  
Consenting adult (age≥18) patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of 
advanced/metastatic solid tumours with ALK positive alterations (per original protocol) or ALK negative 
patients with TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, or ROS1 genetic alterations (ALK negative patients with TRKA or 
ROS1 genetic alterations only up to protocol amendment 5) in patients for whom no alternative 
effective standard therapy was available, standard therapy was considered unsuitable, or had been 
refused (per protocol amendment 8), were eligible for the study.  
Other main selection criteria included: ECOG PS ≤2; life expectancy of at least 3 months; baseline 
laboratory data indicating acceptable hematologic status, liver and renal function; resolution of any 
acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anticancer therapy (NCI CTCAE v 4.03 grade ≤1 or 
to the baseline laboratory values); tissue available for analysis.  
Patients with controlled asymptomatic CNS involvement were eligible in absence of therapy with 
anticonvulsant (from protocol amendment 8, non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs were allowed). 
Steroids at stable dose (≤4 mg/day dexamethasone or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks were allowed. 
Prior cancer therapy was allowed including crizotinib, ceritinib (added with protocol amendment 6) and 
other investigational drugs. From protocol amendment 8 onwards, prior TRK, ROS1, or ALK (all other 
than NSCLC patients only) inhibitors were no longer allowed in patients who had tumours harboring 
those respective molecular alterations. 
Treatments 
- Schedule A: 4 days on, 3-days off schedule for 3 weeks, followed by a 7-day rest period in a 4-week 
cycle; fasted condition; once daily. 
 
 
- Schedule B (added at protocol amendment 3): continuous daily dosing in a 4-week cycle; fed 
condition; once daily. 
- Schedule C (added at protocol amendment 3): 4 days on, 3-days off schedule in a 4-week cycle; fed 
condition; once daily. 
A conventional “3+3” patient enrollment scheme was followed for the dose escalation. Patients could 
continue study treatment until disease progression, patient refusal, withdrawal of consent, or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: to determine the first cycle DLTs and the MTD.  
Secondary Objectives: to define the safety profile, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics in plasma, and to 
document any antitumour activity of entrectinib. 
Endpoints 
Primary endpoint: first cycle DLTs and MTD.  
Secondary endpoints: 
- Overall safety profile of entrectinib 
- PK parameters  
- Objective tumour response as measured using RECIST v1.1 as determined by investigator (DOR, SD 
duration, PFS and OS were exploratory analyses). 
On treatment tumour assessment was repeated at the end of every even (i.e. end of cycle 2, 4, 6 etc., 
per the original protocol) or odd cycle (per protocol amendment 6) and at the end of last treatment 
cycle, if more than 4 weeks had passed from last tumour imaging. For patient treated for longer than 
12 cycles, assessment was performed every 3 cycles (per protocol amendment 6). Patients with 
responding tumours (CR or PR) were required to have the response confirmed at least 4 weeks after 
the 1st documentation of response. Amendment 8 allowed a blinded independent central review of 
imaging for retrospective (ongoing patients) and prospective (newly enrolled patients). 
Sample size 
Number of subjects planned to be enrolled was 70. The total number of patients enrolled and treated 
could vary, depending upon the toxicity observed and the resulting influence on cohort size and 
number of dose levels tested. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were carried out on treated and evaluable patients. Point estimates with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) are calculated for efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, SD duration, PFS, and OS). 
Time-to-event endpoints were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. No formal significance 
testing was performed. Missing data were not imputed. The possibility of a CSR be written prior to the 
official end of the study was added by a protocol amendment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled from 26 Oct 2012 to 20 Mar 2018 in two sites in Italy. Data provided includes 
patients enrolled up to 30 Nov 2017, with a clinical cut off date (CCOD) of 31 May 2018. As of 30 Nov 
2017, 58 patients were enrolled, and 57 received entrectinib. The study is ongoing. Two patients were 
still receiving treatment at the CCOD.  
Conduct of the study 
The protocol for this study was approved on 23 Jan 2012. During the study, 10 protocol amendments 
were implemented. Patient enrollment was initiated with the first amendment dated 05 Mar 2012. 
Baseline data 
Tumour  molecular  characterization  performed  before  starting  treatment  with  entrectinib  showed  the 
presence of a TRKA/B/C, ROS1, or ALK molecular alterations in all treated patients except for patient 
##0055 who had SCLC without genetic alterations of interest but enrolled in the study with a waiver. 
Patient  ##0004  was  enrolled  in  the  study  based  on  the  molecular  analysis  performed  at  the  local 
laboratory  (which  is  not  reported;  molecular  analysis  was  later  confirmed  by  central  molecular 
diagnosis).  
 
 
 
Numbers analysed 
Overall,  58  patients  with  advanced/  metastatic  solid  tumours  with  TRKA/B/C,  ROS1,  or  ALK  positive 
genetic alterations were enrolled, 57 received entrectinib, 54 patients were evaluable for DLT and 54 for 
efficacy. 
Outcomes and estimation 
DLTs and MTD: No DLTs were reported in this study and, consequently, no MTD could be defined for any 
of  3  schedules  investigated.  Because  drug  exposure  was  in  the  predicted  efficacious  range  and 
preliminary  antitumour  activity  was  observed,  400  mg/m2  was  declared  the  BSA-based  RP2D  of 
entrectinib. 
STARTRK-1 
This study included a dose escalation and a dose expansion segment. As no patients were enrolled in 
the ongoing dose expansion as of the enrollment cut off of 30 Nov 2017, data from the dose expansion 
segment has not been included in the submission. 
A Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of Oral Entrectinib (RXDX-101) in Adult Patients 
With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer Confirmed to be Positive for NTRK1, NTRK2, 
NTRK3, ROS1, or ALK Molecular Alterations (RXDX-101-01). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Adult  patients  (age  ≥18)  with  a  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  diagnosis  of  relapsed  or 
refractory  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumours  for  whom  no  alternative  effective  standard 
therapy  was  available  or  for  whom  standard  therapy  was  considered  unsuitable  or  intolerable  were 
enrolled.  A  molecular  alteration  in  NTRK1,  NTRK2,  NTRK3,  ROS1,  or  ALK  was  preferred,  but  not  a 
requirement  for  patient  eligibility  in  the  dose  escalation,  while  it  was  required  in  the  dose  expansion 
segment.  
Other main inclusion criteria included: measurable or evaluable disease assessed locally using RECIST 
v1.1; ECOG PS ≤2; life expectancy of at least 3 months; acceptable baseline laboratory values as per 
protocol; resolution of all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anticancer therapy to NCI 
CTCAE (v4.03) grade ≤1 or to the baseline laboratory values.  
Patients with controlled asymptomatic CNS involvement were allowed in the study. Seizure prophylaxis 
was allowed if with non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAEDs). Patients requiring steroids 
must have been at a stable or decreasing dose (≤8 mg/day dexamethasone or equivalent) for at least 2 
weeks prior to entrectinib treatment start. 
Prior  cancer  therapy  was  allowed,  including  crizotinib,  ceritinib,  and  investigational  drugs.  Prior 
radiotherapy was allowed if >14 days had elapsed since end-of-treatment visit. 
Tumour tissue available for analysis was not required in the dose escalation segment but was desired (if 
clinically feasible) for the dose expansion segment. 
Treatments 
Dose escalation segment: all patients in each dose cohort received entrectinib orally for 28 consecutive 
days (for patients enrolled between protocol v2 [26 Mar 2014] and protocol v4 [08 Oct 2014], cycle 1 
was 42 consecutive days and all subsequent cycles were 28 days). The starting dose was 100 mg/m2 
(based  on  BSA),  once  daily,  administered  within  60  minutes  following  a  meal.  A  conventional  “3+3” 
patient enrollment scheme was followed. 
 
 
Dose  expansion  segment:  all  patients  received  entrectinib  at  the  RP2D  determined  during  the  dose 
escalation segment (600 mg OD in repeated 4 weeks cycles) 
Treatment  with  entrectinib  continued  until  progressive  disease,  withdrew  consent,  or  unacceptable 
toxicity. In cases of progressive disease, after discussion with the sponsor, treatment could continue if 
the investigator believed that the patient might continue to derive clinical benefit. 
Two entrectinib formulations (F1 and F2A) were used in this study. 
Objectives (dose escalation segment) 
Primary objective:  
• 
to determine the first cycle DLTs, the MTD, and a biologically effective and RP2D. 
Secondary objectives:  
•  Safety profile  
• 
PK of entrectinib (and its potential metabolites) in plasma 
•  Antitumor activity  
•  Assay methods to detect molecular alterations (as defined in biomarker assessments), and 
identify appropriate analytical cutoffs and other relevant biomarker parameters that predict 
antitumour activity of entrectinib 
Pharmacodynamics (PD) of entrectinib on molecular targets in tumour and surrogate tissue 
Endpoints (dose escalation segment) 
Primary endpoint:  
• 
first cycle DLTs, MTD, and the RP2D 
Secondary endpoints:  
•  Safety  
• 
• 
• 
• 
PK parameters 
Efficacy parameters (ORR by RECIST 1.1, PFS, OS, CBR, DOR) 
PD profile  
Tumour assessment: Tumour imaging was performed at the end of cycle 1, then every 8 weeks 
thereafter (ie, end of cycles 3, 5, 7, etc, or whenever a clinical deterioration was observed) and 
at the end-of-treatment visit. For patients with CR or PR, response confirmation was required 
to be performed no less than 4 weeks from when response criteria were first met.  
Sample size 
The dose escalation segment of the study is designed as a Phase 1 study with safety and treatment 
tolerability as its primary objectives. No power calculations were done. Updated sample size included 
at least 15 patients. 
Statistical methods 
Summary statistics were used to present data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Time-to-event 
endpoints (PFS, OS, and DOR) were calculated from start date to the date of the applicable event and 
were reported in months. PFS and OS were to be analyzed in all treated patients (ie, the safety 
analysis set), however, these analyses were performed using the efficacy analysis set to align all 
 
 
efficacy endpoints for the same population. Time-to-event endpoints were summarized using the 
Kaplan Meier estimates. No formal significance testing was performed. Missing data were not imputed 
except for partially missing dates. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Patients were recruited in 11 centers in the United States (n=8), Spain (n=2), and South Korea (n=1). 
First enrolment occurred on 30 July 2014. The study is ongoing.  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 25 February 2014, was amended 6 times during the study. Additionally, 
the modified Fibonacci scheme that was planned for the dose escalation segment was not followed as 
information from the ALKA study was used to direct dose escalation after the 400 mg/m2 dose.

Numbers analysed 
The DLT analysis set (dose escalation) included 14 patients. The safety analysis set included 76 
patients and the efficacy analysis set included 68 patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints 
DLT: Three patients in the 800 mg dose group had 1 DLT each: grade 3 fatigue (002-108), grade 3 
disturbance in attention (003-105), grade 3 fatigue (005-105; this occurred after the decision was 
made to lower the dose to 600 mg based on the previous two DLTs).  
RP2D: During dose escalation, because no DLTs were reported, 400 mg/m2 was declared the BSA-
based RP2D of entrectinib. At the 400 mg/m2, drug exposure was predicted efficaceous range, and 
preliminary antitumor activity observed. Per the protocol, at the BSA-based RP2D, administration of a 
flat dose was to be considered; therefore, patients were enrolled at a once daily dose of 800 mg. As 
DLT were observed at the 800 mg flat dose, 600 mg once daily on a continuous daily dosing regimen 
was declared as the RP2D of entrectinib (decision based also on favourable tolerability, exposure and 
preliminary antitumor activity of 600 compared to 800).

2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
An Open-Label, Multicenter, Global Phase 2 Basket Study of Entrectinib for the Treatment of 
Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors that Harbor NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, 
OR ALK Gene Rearrangements (GO40782, STARTRK-2). 
Figure 9: STARTRK2 Basket Study Schema 
A “natural history follow-up cohort” included only 12 patients up to Nov 2017.  
Methods 
Study Participants 
•  Adult patients (≥18 years) who signed consent form with histologically- or cytologically-
confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that harbors an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or 
ALK gene rearrangement that is predicted to translate into a fusion protein with a functional 
TRKA/B/C, ROS1, or ALK kinase domain, respectively, without a concomitant second 
oncodriver (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, KRAS) as determined by Ignyta’s CAP/CLIA 
laboratory or by any nucleic acid-based diagnostic testing method performed at a local CLIA-
certified or equivalently-accredited diagnostic laboratory. 
•  Measurable disease as assessed locally using the RECIST v1.1 (patients with non-measurable 
disease were eligible for enrollment in the “non-evaluable” basket). 
• 
Patients with CNS involvement, including leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which is either 
asymptomatic or previously-treated and controlled, are allowed. Seizure prophylaxis is allowed 
 
 
 
with non-EIAEDs only. Patients requiring steroids must be at stable or decreasing doses for at 
least 2 weeks prior to the start of entrectinib treatment.  
• 
Prior anticancer therapy is allowed (excluding approved or investigational TRK, ROS1, or ALK 
(non-NSCLC patients only) inhibitors in patients who have tumors that harbor those respective 
gene rearrangements). Prior radiotherapy is allowed if more than 14 days have elapsed since 
the end of treatment. Patients who received brain irradiation must have completed whole brain 
radiotherapy at least 14 days prior and/or stereotactic radiosurgery at least 7 days prior to the 
start of entrectinib treatment. 
• 
ECOG performance status ≤2 and minimum life expectancy of at least 4 weeks 
•  Adequate liver function (AST and ALT≤3.0×ULN; ≤5.0×ULN if liver metastases are present; 
total serum bilirubin ≤2.0×ULN; patients with a known history of Gilbert’s syndrome and/or 
isolated elevations of indirect bilirubin are eligible). 
• 
Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test during Screening 
and must not be breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant during the study.  
•  Ability to swallow entrectinib intact without chewing, crushing, or opening the capsules. 
Key Exclusion Criteria: 
•  History of other previous cancer that would interfere with the determination of safety or 
efficacy of entrectinib with respect to the qualifying solid tumor malignancy. 
• 
Incomplete recovery from any surgery. 
•  Any condition (in the past 3 months) that would interfere with the determination of safety or 
efficacy of entrectinib: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery 
bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient 
ischemic attack, stroke, symptomatic bradycardia, or uncontrolled arrhythmias requiring 
medication. 
•  History of non-pharmacologically induced prolonged QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration 
of a QTc interval ≥500 milliseconds from ECGs performed at least 24 hours apart). 
•  History of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., family history of long QT 
syndrome). 
• 
Peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥2. 
•  Known active infections (bacterial, fungal, or viral, including HIV positive). 
•  Active gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or short gut syndrome) 
or other malabsorption syndromes that would reasonably impact drug absorption. 
•  Known interstitial lung disease, interstitial fibrosis, or history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-
induced pneumonitis. Note: Radiation-induced lung disorders are not included in this exclusion 
criterion. 
Treatments 
Entrectinib 600 mg orally once-daily on a continuous daily dosing regimen in 4-week cycles. 
Patients were treated until documented radiographic progression as assessed by BICR, development of 
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients could continue treatment with entrectinib 
 
 
after BICR-confirmed disease progression if the patient was perceived to be deriving clinical benefit. 
For these patients, tumor assessments were no longer submitted for BICR.  
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
• 
To determine the ORR of entrectinib, as assessed by blinded independent central review 
(BICR), in each patient population basket of solid tumors that harbor an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or 
ALK gene rearrangement. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
To determine DOR, TTR, and CBR of entrectinib, as assessed by BICR, in each patient 
population basket of solid tumors that harbor an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene 
rearrangement 
• 
To determine the intracranial tumor response of entrectinib and CNS progression-free survival 
(CNS-PFS) in patients presenting with measurable CNS disease at baseline, as assessed by 
BICR using RANO or RANO-BM, as applicable 
• 
To estimate the PFS and OS of patients with solid tumors that harbor an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or 
ALK gene rearrangement treated with entrectinib 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entrectinib when administered at the RP2D in patients 
with solid tumors that harbor an NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene rearrangement 
• 
To assess the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of entrectinib and to explore correlations 
between PK, response, and/or safety findings in patients with NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene 
rearrangements 
To evaluate the effect of entrectinib on ventricular repolarization 
To assess treatment-related symptoms and general health status using validated instruments 
• 
• 
of patient reported outcomes 
Exploratory objectives (to be reported separately):  
• 
To assess any potential differences in clinicopathologic presentation and response to entrectinib 
among the various tumor types harboring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene rearrangements 
• 
To gain insights into potential mechanisms of resistance to entrectinib 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
•  ORR (confirmed response = persisted on repeated-imaging≥4 weeks after initial 
documentation of response) 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  DOR, TTR, CBR (CR, PR, or SD at 6 months after the first dose of entrectinib), Intracranial 
tumor response in patients with measurable CNS disease, as determined by BICR using RANO 
or RANO-BM, as applicable, CNS progression free survival (CNS-PFS) in patients with 
measurable CNS disease, PFS, OS 
 
 
•  AEs 
• 
Population PK 
•  Ventricular repolarization 
•  Quality-of-life and health status 
Exploratory endpoints: 
•  Analysis of potential differences in clinicopathologic presentation and response to entrectinib 
among the various tumor types harboring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene rearrangements 
• 
Potential mechanisms of resistance to entrectinib    
•  All radiographic efficacy endpoints were based on BICR using RECIST v1.1 (except for patients 
with CNS disease where radiographic confirmation of intracranial objective tumor response or 
disease progression was based on RANO or RANO-BM). 
• 
Tumor assessments were performed at Screening, at the end of Cycle 1 and every 8 weeks, 
and at the End of Treatment (if more than 4 weeks had passed since the last imaging 
assessment). Radiographic confirmation of objective tumor response (no earlier than 4 weeks 
from the first response) or disease progression was based on RECIST v1.1 and assessed both 
locally and by BICR. Stable disease can be assigned only after a patient meets stable disease 
criteria for at least 5 weeks (≥35 days) following the first dose of treatment. At Screening, a 
CT/MRI of the brain was obtained to rule out newly diagnosed, untreated brain metastases or 
to document stability of previously treated brain metastases. If brain metastases were not 
documented at Screening, then brain scans were performed as clinically indicated. 
Sample size 
For each basket evaluable for the primary endpoint, a 2-stage sequential testing design was adopted, 
with up to 62 patients needed to be enrolled. By assuming at least 80% power and 1-sided 
alpha=0.025, and by considering a true response rate of 20% or less insufficient to warrant further 
study, whereas a true response rate of 40% or more worthy of further study, the number of patients 
evaluated in each stage and the minimum number of responders needed to meet the primary endpoint 
were determined. In the first stage up to 13 patients are enrolled sequentially per basket. The stage 
was deemed successful on the 4th responder and the second stage was considered. In the second 
stage additional 49 patients need to be enrolled sequentially per basket, and the stage was deemed as 
having met the primary endpoint if the 14th responder was observed prior to the enrollment of the 
49th response-evaluable patient in stage 2.  
Moreover, for the ROS1-Positive, ROS1 Inhibitor-Naïve NSCLC Basket, based on expected response 
rate to crizotinib, after completion of the two stage design (Part A), a further study (Part B) was 
planned to rule out a statistically significant BICR-ORR<=50%, by assuming the true ORR is at least 
65%, power of 80% and 1-sided alpha=0.025. In this phase, 90 additional treated patients were 
needed. A pooled analysis of safety and efficacy of Parts A and B was planned, with approximately 150 
(=62+90) ROS1-positive, ROS1 inhibitor-naïve NSCLC patients treated with entrectinib at the RP2D. 
Such sample size, allows to rule out an ORR <=50% when the true ORR is at least 65% at a 1-sided 
alpha=0.025 and >90% power.

Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Each study basket was considered an independent study. All efficacy analyses were performed for the 
Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Population (EE) populations of NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors and ROS1-
positive NSCLC, unless otherwise specified.  
ORR was reported as the proportion of responders along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% Clopper-
Pearson exact confidence interval (CI). Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) was reported as the proportion of 
patients achieving the clinical benefit with corresponding 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson exact CI. 
Intracranial Tumor Response (IC-ORR): were reported as the proportion of patients achieving 
intracranial tumor response on the total number of patients with brain metastases at baseline, with 
corresponding 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval. Time to Event data (DOR, TTR, 
PFS, time to CNS progression, IC-PFS, and OS) were summarized by median, 25th, and 75th 
percentiles estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associated 95% CIs were calculated using 
the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) and Klein and Moeschberger (1997). Landmark 
analyses (e.g., duration rates at 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months) were provided with 
their corresponding 95% CIs calculated using the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980). Median 
follow-up was estimated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method (Schemper and Smith. 1996). 
Depending on available sample size (n >=5), subgroup analyses of safety and efficacy were performed 
by Age, Sex, Race, Region, ECOG, Number of Lines of Prior Anticancer Therapies, Prior Treatment, 
Types of prior treatment, Prior radiation, Extracranial vs. intracranial solid tumors. Exploratory 
analyses to assess concordance between BICR and Investigators assessments of response, and 
sensitivity analyses of ORR-BICR for the full EA were carried out. Inferential statistics were not 
generated.  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 84 investigative sites in 15 countries globally. Enrollment started on 16 
November 2016 and is ongoing. 
The initial protocol was dated 30 July 2015. The latest protocol version number 6 is dated 28 May 
2019.  
2.5.3.  ROS1 positive NSCLC 
An integrated efficacy analysis has been presented to support the use of entrectinib for the treatment 
of patients with ROS1-positive, advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This was conducted based on the ROS1 
NSCLC Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set, composed of adult patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC treated 
with at least one dose of entrectinib across the three studies in adult patients with solid tumors (ALKA, 
STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2). All patients included in the ROS1 NSCLC Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set 
had measurable disease at baseline and at least 12 months follow-up from the time of first response.  
The ROS1 NSCLC Efficacy Evaluable Analysis set includes n=53 patients enrolled up to 30 April 2017. 
Of the n=53 patients, 9 were in ALKA, 7 in STARTRK-1 and 37 in STARTRK-2.   
A larger dataset of n=94 subjects enrolled up to 30 Nov 2017 was provided per CHMP request (not 
pre-specified in the iSAP and considered exploratory). In addition to the n=53 patients above, this 
 
 
dataset include further 41 patients enrolled between 30 April 2017 and 30 Nov 2017, all treated within 
the STARTRK-2 study. 
Methods 
Study participants  
The enrolled population is defined as the population of patients who were enrolled into 1 or more of the 
entrectinib studies. For the efficacy analysis, data were pooled across the 3 adult (age ≥18 years) clinical 
studies ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2. Patients must meet all of the following criteria: 
- Have tumors that harbour a ROS1 gene fusion (as defined below) 
- Received at least 1 dose of entrectinib 
- Has NSCLC 
- Not treated previously with a ROS1 inhibitor (eg, crizotinib) 
Molecular characterization of tumour tissue:  
Assay  methods:  the  molecular  characterization  of  tumour  tissue  for  patients  included  in  the  pooled 
analysis was determined by several methods, including the following: 
ALKA: Local FISH or IHC. If tissue is available, independent central testing is performed post enrolment 
at the following laboratories: 
Central laboratory (Niguarda) using FISH and IHC methods 
Ignyta CLIA laboratory, using the Trailblaze Pharos NGS testing method 
STARTRK-1: Local FISH, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), IHC, or NGS 
STARTRK-2: Local nucleic acid-based methodology from a clinical laboratory improvements amendment 
(CLIA)-certified or equivalently-accredited diagnostic laboratory, or central testing by Ignyta Trailblaze 
Pharos NGS testing. For patients enrolled based on the positive interpretation of the local test, tissue, if 
available, is sent for independent central testing at Ignyta using Trailblaze Pharos. 
Patients  samples  determined  to  be  positive  by  local  testing  were  re-tested  centrally  by  the  Sponsor 
where possible (method TrailBlaze Pharos).  
In STARTRK-2 protocol version 6 (28 May 2019), testing for enrollment eligibility was performed in on 
of the two ways: 
-  A representative tumour  tissue specimen may be submitted to the central laboratory of Foundation 
Medicine, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, or to the alternative, approved central laboratory for 
that region, to be tested for the presence or absence of target gene rearrangements (fusions) via next 
generation sequencing (NGS). 
- Alternatively, patient specimens may be tested locally using any nucleic acid-based diagnostic testing 
method that relies on direct assessment of gene rearrangements and is performed in a CLIA-certified or 
equivalently-accredited diagnostic laboratory. FISH is not an acceptable method. All patients enrolled via 
local testing will still be required to provide tissue samples as described above to Foundation Medicine, 
Inc., or to the alternative, approved central laboratory for that region for independent central molecular 
NGS testing post-enrollment. 
 
 
Gene fusion status: Only patients harboring gene fusions in NTRK, ROS1, or ALK that are predicted to 
translate into a fusion protein with a functional kinase domain are considered to have a positive gene-
fusion status. Patients having other types of molecular alterations (eg, noncoding gene 
rearrangements, single nucleotide polymorphisms, over-expression, deletions, amplifications, etc.) are 
not considered to be positive for a gene fusion. Patients having the NTRK, ROS1, or ALK gene fusion 
and evidence of co-occurrence with 1 or more other oncogenic drivers (eg, NTRK1 with KRAS or EGFR) 
are not be considered positive for gene fusion because these patients lack a sole known oncodriver. 
Treatments 
At least one dose of entrectinib at or above the RP2D of 600 mg.  
Objectives 
Primary Efficacy Objectives: 
•  Determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of entrectinib as assessed by blinded independent 
central review (BICR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1  
•  Determine the duration of response (DOR) as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives: 
•  Determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of entrectinib as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 
• 
• 
Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by BICR and overall survival (OS) 
Estimate the time to CNS progression as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1 
In a subset of patients with CNS disease at baseline by INV, the following were assessed: 
- Overall (systemic) ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 
- Intracranial ORR (IC-ORR) as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 in patients presenting with 
measurable  CNS  lesions  at  baseline,  as  well  as  patients  with  measurable  and  nonmeasurable 
CNS lesions at baseline 
- Intracranial DOR (IC-DOR) as assessed by BICR 
- Intracranial PFS (IC-PFS) as assessed by BICR 
Safety Objectives: 
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of entrectinib 
Patient Reported Outcomes Objectives (STARTRK-2 only): 
Assess treatment-related symptoms and general health status following treatment with entrectinib using 
validated instruments of patient reported outcomes 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
Objective 
Response 
Rate (ORR) 
Proportion  of  patients  with  confirmed  CR  or  PR  (responders)  per  RECIST  1.1  by  BICR;  a 
confirmed response was a response that persisted on repeat-imaging ≥4 weeks after initial 
documentation of response.  
 
 
Non-responders included the following: 
• Patients without a confirmed objective response 
• Patients without a baseline or post-baseline tumor assessment 
• Patients who received at least 1 dose of entrectinib and who discontinued for any reason 
prior to undergoing one post-baseline response evaluation. 
of 
Duration 
Response 
(DOR) 
Time  from  the  date  of  first  objective  response  (either  CR  or  PR)  to  first  documentation  of 
radiographic disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever was earlier. 
Evaluation  was  based  on  RECIST  1.1  by  BICR.  DOR  (months)  was  calculated  only  for 
responders.  
For  patients  without  disease  progression  or  death,  DOR  was  censored  at  the  last  tumor 
assessment date prior to the CCOD. 
Best  Overall 
Response 
(BOR) 
Best radiologic overall response recorded at any single time point from the start of treatment 
until disease progression, based on RECIST v1.1. by BICR. 
CR or PR required confirmation no earlier than 4 weeks from the first response. SD could have 
been assigned only after a patient met SD criteria for at least 5 weeks (≥35 days) following 
the first dose of treatment. Otherwise, the best response was not evaluable. BOR not evaluable 
included also: no post-baseline scans available and missing subsets of scans at all timepoints.  
Patients with only non-target lesions could only have been assessed as CR, non-CR/non-PD, 
PD or not evaluable, as per RECIST v1.1 guidelines. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
Clinical 
Benefit  Rate 
(CBR) 
CBR was the proportion of patients who met one of the following criteria (assessed by BICR 
per RECIST v1.1): 
• Confirmed CR or confirmed PR 
SD for at least 6 months following start of entrectinib 
Time  to  CNS 
Progression 
Time  (months)  from  first  dose  of  entrectinib  to  first  documentation  of  radiographic  CNS 
disease  progression  or  death due  to  any cause. Radiographic  CNS  disease progression was 
defined as an occurrence of a new CNS lesion or progression in any CNS lesion per RECIST 
v1.1 by BICR.  
Progression-
Free  Survival 
(PFS) 
Overall 
Survival (OS) 
Patients without radiographic CNS progression or death were censored on the date of the last 
tumor assessment prior to the CCOD.  
(Note: patients without CNS lesions present at baseline per investigator assessment were not 
required to have scheduled brain scans every 8 weeks). 
Time  (months)  from first dose  of  entrectinib  to  first  documentation  of radiographic  disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1 by BICR or death due to any cause.  
Patients without progression or death were censored on the date of the last tumor assessment 
(or, if no tumor assessment was performed after the baseline visit, at the date of first dose of 
entrectinib) prior to the CCOD. 
Time (months) from the first dose of entrectinib to the date of death due to any cause.  
Patients who were alive at the time of the analysis were censored on the last known date that 
they were alive on or prior to CCOD. Patients with no post-baseline information were censored 
on the date of first dose of entrectinib. Patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent 
for further follow-up were censored on the last known date that they were alive on or prior to 
CCOD. 
Intracranial-specific endpoints

Intracranial 
Objective 
Response 
Rate        (IC-

Intracranial-
of 
Duration 
Response  (IC-
DOR) 
Proportion of patients with confirmed CR or PR in the CNS lesion(s) per RECIST 1.1 by BICR 
(intracranial  responders).  Confirmed  response  persisted  on  repeat-imaging  ≥4  weeks  after 
initial documentation of response.  
The analysis was performed for patients presenting with measurable CNS lesions at baseline, 
as well as for patients with only non-measurable CNS lesions at baseline, selecting only CNS 
lesion(s) (target, non-target, or both, as determined by BICR) for each patient, and applying 
RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Time from the date of first intracranial response to first documentation of radiographic CNS 
disease progression (per RECIST 1.1 by BICR) or date of death due to any cause, whichever 
was earlier. IC-DOR was calculated only for intracranial responders. 
For patients without CNS disease progression and who did not die within 30 days of the last 
dose of study treatment, IC-DOR was censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to any 
date of subsequent anticancer therapy, including surgery or radiotherapy to the brain. 
Intracranial 
Progression-
Free  Survival   
(IC-PFS) 
Time  (months)  from  first  dose  of  entrectinib  to  first  documentation  of  radiographic  CNS 
disease  progression  or  death due  to  any cause. Radiographic  CNS  disease progression was 
defined as an occurrence of a new CNS lesion or progression in any CNS lesion per RECIST 
v1.1 by BICR.  
Patients without radiographic CNS progression or death were censored on the date of the last 
tumor assessment prior to the CCOD. 
The censoring rules for IC-DOR and DOR were the same, no 30 days criteria was applied, and that all 
censored  patients  (at  the  time of  last  tumour  assessment)  were  not  progressing  (intracranially  if  IC-
DOR) /not died at the CCOD. 
Tumour assessment:  
- Tumour scans for patients in the STARTRK-2 study were evaluated prospectively.  
- Tumour scans for patients included in the efficacy-evaluable patient populations from the ALKA and 
STARTRK-1 studies were evaluated by the same BICR team. 
Screening tumour assessments (CT/MRI) of the thorax and abdomen, plus brain were performed 4 weeks 
prior to the first administration of entrectinib.  
Sample size 
By assuming the true objective response rate by BICR was 70%, a sample size of at least 50 patients 
would have yielded a 95% 2-sided confidence interval with precision ±17% that would have excluded a 
lower limit of 50%. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were carried out on the ROS1 NSCLC efficacy-evaluable population. Summary 
statistics with 95% 2-sided CIs properly calculated were used. 
ORR, CBR, IC-ORR: proportion and corresponding 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson exact CI. 
Time-to-event endpoints (DOR, PFS, OS, IC-DOR, IC-PFS, Time to CNS progression): median,  25th, 
and 75th percentiles estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associated 2-sided 95%CIs 
were calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowly (1982) and Klein and Moeschberger 
(1997). Landmark analyses at 6, 9, and 12 months were provided with the corresponding 2-sided 95% 
 
 
CIs calculated using the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980). Kaplan-Meier curves will be 
presented. 
Waterfall and swimmer plots were used to depict each patient’s best tumor response (BOR) and time 
on study, respectively, including time to first objective response by BICR (if applicable) and DOR. 
Formal significance tests were not performed. No statistical adjustment was made to address the 
sources of multiplicity associated with the integrated analysis, nor to account for subgroup effects 
associated with pooling of data. Statistical analyses were carried out overall, by study, by CNS-disease 
status at baseline by INV. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess robustness of findings. 
Exploratory analysis on ROS1 NSCLC efficacy nonevaluable population was planned.

A larger dataset including n=161 patients wth has been submitted by the Applicant as per CHMP request. 
This dataset include ROS1 NSCLC adult patients enrolled up to 31 Oct 2018, with CCOD 1 May 2019, i.e. 
all subjects had >6 months of follow up.  
Median survival follow up is 15.8 months (95%CI 14.49, 18.23).  
The efficacy results of this n=161 updated dataset are below: 
-  ORR  67.1%  (responders  108/161)  (95%CI  59.25,  74.27);  CR  14  (8.7%),  PR  94  (58.4%),  SD  14 
(8.7%), PD 15 (9.3%), non CR/PD 10 (6.2%), missing or unevaluable 14 (8.7%). 
- DOR median 15.7 months (95%CI 13.9, 28.6); patients with DOR event 44.4% (48/108) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- PFS median 15.7 months (95%CI 11.0, 21.1); patients with PFS event 50.9% (82/161) 
- OS median NE (95%CI 28.3, NE); patients with OS event 23.6% (38/161) 
Of  those  161  subjects,  46  had  CNS  disease  at  baseline.  IC-ORR  was  52.2%  (24/46)  (95%CI  36.95, 
67.1), which includes 8 CR (17.4%). Of those, 24 had measurable CNS disease by BIRC, in whom IC-
ORR was 79.2% (19 responders) (95%CI 57.85, 92.9); IC-DOR in the 19 responders was 12.9 months 
(95%CI 6.8, 22.1).

Best Overall Response is derived per RECIST 1.1. Not Evaluable/Not Done category includes patients 
having on-study scans that could not be evaluated and patients who discontinued prior to obtaining 
adequate scans to evaluate or confirm response. SD and NonCR/NonPD must be observed study day 35 
or later, otherwise they count as NE. Objective response is defined as PR or CR confirmed by 
repeat- imaging at least 28 days following first documentation of response. Otherwise, the patient 
is considered to be a non-responder. 
Confidence Intervals (CI) are calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.

Time to CNS Progression  
The median time to first documentation of radiographic CNS disease progression or death due to any 
cause as assessed by BICR was not estimable (NE) (95% CI: 15.1, NE) in the original MAA (CCOD 31 
May 2018). In the updated analysis (CCOD 31 October 2018) was 30.8 months (95% CI: 15.1, NE).

First  site  of  progression:  first  progression  occurred  intracranially  in  36%  (8/22)  of  subjects  who 
progressed during the study. Higher incidence of progression in the brain as 1st site was observed in 
patient with baseline CNS disease (65%, 6/9) compared to patients with no baseline CNS disease (15%, 
2/13).  
Among the patients responding to entrectinib and then progressed while on study (n=18), in 16% of 
subjects (3/18) the first site of progression was the brain. Higher incidence of progression in the brain 
as 1st site was observed in patient with baseline CNS disease (33%, 2/6) compared to patients with no 
baseline CNS disease (8%, 1/12).

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Table 40: Objective Response Rate by Subgroups (BICR Assessment) (CCOD 31 May 2018) 
ORR by age was 78.6% (33/42) in patients aged ≥18 to <65 years, and 72.7% (8/11) in patients aged 
≥65 years. ORR by region was 73.7% (14/19) in EU, 80% (12/15) in USA, and 78.9% (15/19) in all 
other  countries.  ORR  by  prior  immunotherapy  was  77.1%  (37/48)  in  patients  with  no  prior 
immunotherapy, and 80% (4/5) in patients with prior immunotherapy.   
 
 
 
Table 41: Objective Response Rate by ROS-1 gene fusion partner (BICR Assessment) (CCOD 31 May 
2018) 
Analysis by investigator assessment 
ORR  by  Inv:  75.5%  (95%  CI:  61.7%,  86.2%).  Six  patients  (11.3%)  achieved  CR  and  34  patients 
(64.2%) achieved PR.  
Concordance  in  ORR  between  investigator  and  BICR  was  86.9%  (46/53  patients  identified  as 
responders/non responders in both assessment). In 3 subjects (5.7%) PD was declared by investigator 
earlier than BICR, while in 5 cases (9.4%) later than BICR. 
DOR by Inv: median DOR for the 40 responders based on the investigator assessment was 16.6 months 
(95% CI: 13.1, 21.4). 
PFS by Inv: median PFS by inv was 15.5 months (95%CI 10.0, 19.0)  
Patients excluded from the efficacy evaluable analysis dataset 
Subjects excluded from the patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC efficacy evaluable set were the following:  
- non-measurable disease (12 months of FU minimum n=3; less than 12 months of FU n=6) 
- ECOG PS>2 (n=3) 
- ROS1 biomarker ineligible (n=1) 
- received prior ROS1 inhibitor (n=27)  
Patients who received prior ROS1 inhibitors:  
Of a total 27 subjects who received entrectinib after other ROS1 inhibitor, 3 only responded 
(3/27=11.1%). These 27 ROS1 positive NSCLC patients previously treated with crizotinib (9 in 
STARTRK-1 and 18 in STARTRK-2) included 19 patients who previously experienced CNS-only 
progression and 8 overall systemic progression while on crizotinib. A total of 2 responses were 
 
 
 
observed among the 19 patients with CNS-progression only (RR 10.5%), and 1 response among 8 
patients with overall systemic progression (RR 12.5%).   
Patients Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
PROs were only evaluated in STARTRK-2 study (i.e. 37 subjects of the 53 included in the ROS1 NSCLC 
efficacy analysis set). Overall, all patients completed the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-LC13 questionnaire on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 and answered at least 1 question on an onstudy time point thereafter. The number of 
patients with evaluable QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires at baseline were 34 (91.9%) and 33 
(89.2%) respectively. The completion rates for both questionnaires remained ≥80% at most study 
visit, but was 42% at the EOT visit. At baseline, patients reported moderate-to-high functioning scores 
for QLQ-C30 (global health status [57.84], physical functioning [68.87], role functioning [60.29], and 
cognitive functioning [81.86]). While receiving entrectinib, patients tended to maintain or improve on 
high baseline health-related quality of life (mean changes ranging from -37.50 to 11.74 on the global 
health status). For functional scales (e.g., physical functioning, role functioning, and cognitive 
functioning), patients continued to report moderate-to-high scores at most study visits with a trend 
towards clinical improvement, with the exception of cognitive functioning which trended towards some 
worsening at specific timepoints that were above the clinical meaningful threshold of 10-points (worst 
mean change score of -41.76 at Cycle 22 Day 1). According to the QLQ-LC13, patients reported 
moderate symptom burden at baseline (chest pain [mean score=17.17], dyspnea [mean 
score=38.05]), with trends towards immediate improvement. Severe cough was reported at baseline 
(mean score of 44.44), followed by immediate meaningful improvement (mean change from baseline 
score of -17.86 on Cycle 2 Day 1).

Secondary resistance 
ctDNA in plasma samples collected at baseline and at progression was analysed on NGS 
FoundationOne Liquid (~70 gene) assay. To date, of the 53 NSCLC ROS1 fusion positive MAA patients, 
18 had matched pre and end of treatment plasma collections. 4 patients showed the emergence of the 
crizotinib resistance mutation (G2032R) at the end of treatment sample, and 1 patient showed the 
emergence of the ROS1 mutation F2004C at end of treatment collection, which were not present in the 
pre-treatment samples. 
Summary of main efficacy results (integrated ROS1 NSCLC analysis) 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Study identifier 
Design 
Integrated analysis of the ROS1-positive NSCLC patients treated within 3 studies: 
- RXDX-101-02 (STARTRK-2) 
- ALKA-372-001 (ALKA) 
- RXDX-101-01 (STARTRK-1)  
Pooled analysis. All patients received entrectinib.  
The design of the 3 studies were: 
- STARTRK-2: phase 2 global single arm open label multicenter basket study of oral 
entrectinib at the RP2D in patients with solid tumor with NTRK, ROS1 or ALK gene fusions.  
- ALKA and STARTRK-1: phase 1 single arm open label studies of oral entrectinib in 
patients with solid tumor with NTRK, ROS1 or ALK molecular alterations.

WO40977 Non-Interventional Study (for the ROS1 NSCLC indication) 
In order to bring additional evidence in support of the ROS1 NSCLC application for entrectinib, and to 
compensate the lack of a direct comparative data from a randomized clinical trial, the Applicant 
submitted a retrospective non-interventional study, real world comparative analysis of the integrated 
clinical data (STARTRK-2, STARTRK-1, and ALKA studies) of ROS1-positive NSCLC patients treated with 
entrectinib versus real world matched patients treated with crizotinib. Crizotinib (XALKORI) is currently 
the only ROS1 inhibitor approved in the EU and USA for the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive 
NSCLC. The source of the real world data (RWD) for crizotinib was the Flatiron Health Analytic 
Database (New York, NY, USA).  
Figure 14: Study schema showinmg the overall study design 
Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) was used as primary endpoint, defined as:  
• 
TTD:  For  the  entrectinib  arm,  TTD  was  defined  as  date  from  the  initiation  of  entrectinib  to 
treatment discontinuation.  
• 
In  the  crizotinib  arm,  TTD  was  defined  as  the  date  of  the  initiation  of  crizotinib  to  treatment 
discontinuation. 
Secondary objectives of the study included PFS and OS, as well as description of demographics, clinical 
characteristics and outcomes of the ROS1-positive NSCLC patients with and without CNS metastases at 
baseline (including time to CNS progression).  
The entrectinib arm was the ROS1 NSCLC Efficacy Evaluable analysis set obtained by integrating data 
from STARTRK-2, STARTRK-1, and ALKA studies (n=53). For crizotinib, all patients from the Flatiron 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
database retained after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria derived from the STARTRK-2 
pivotal study (used also for the integrated efficacy analysis set of entrectinib) were considered (n=69), 
from whom a matched crizotinib arm (n=54) was derived for the comparative analysis.  
Table 45: Patient populations at baseline 
Matched propensity score distribution were obtained with the matched crizotinib arm (n=54):  
Figure 15: Propensity score distribution on all population (Top) and after weighting and truncation 
(Bottom) 
Descriptive statistics, evaluation of prognostic factors to be used for the development of a propensity 
score, definition of a matched crizotinib population (matched crizotinib arm), and comparison with the 
entrectinib arm were planned.  
A cohort of 150 ROS1 positive advanced (on or after 1/1/2011) NSCLC patients was received by 
Flatiron. Of those, a total of 63 were in the end selected.

Subgroup analysis on CNS metastases: Among the 69 ROS1 positive patients from Flatiron US 
database who received crizotinib in the real word, the Applicant identified 17 subjects with brain 
metastasis. Several differences in baseline characteristics of patients with CNS disease at baseline 
receiving entrectinib in clinical trials and crizotinib in the real world were observed (data not shown). 
Estimated median PFS was 4.6 months and median OS was 15.5 months in the CNS disease subgroup 
treated with crizotinib. No data on intracranial response to crizotinib are available. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.4.  NTRK gene fusion positive solid tumours indication 
Integrated analysis of efficacy for NTRK gene fusion positive solid tumours 
An integrated efficacy analysis has been presented to support the sought indication of entrectinib for the 
treatment of adult and paediatric patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumour, who have progressed 
following prior therapies or as initial therapy when there are no acceptable standard therapies. This was 
conducted based on the NTRK Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set, composed of 54 adult patients with NTRK 
fusion-positive solid tumour treated with at least one dose of entrectinib across the three studies in adult 
patients  with  solid  tumours  (ALKA,  STARTRK-1,  and  STARTRK-2).  All  patients  included  in  the  NTRK 
Efficacy  Evaluable  Analysis  Set  had  measurable  disease  at  baseline  and  at  least  6  months  follow-up. 
Patients included were enrolled up to 30 November 2017.  
During the procedure, as per CHMP request, data on additional patients and updated analyses have been 
provided (see table below). The latest dataset include 74 adult patients with >6 months of FU. 
Primary CNS tumors, and paediatric patients, have been analysed and reported separately.

Comments 
Efficacy: Pooled adult patients from ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-
2. All patients had ≥6 months of efficacy follow-up at time of CCOD. 
Separate efficacy data was provided for 6 adult patients with primary 
brain tumors, and 1 paediatric patient. All information was presented in 
NTRK SCE (2.7.3). 
Safety: Pooled patients from ALKA, STARTRK 1, STARTRK 2 and 
STARTRK-NG (paediatric). All information was presented in NTRK SCS 
(2.7.4). 
Efficacy: Pooled adult patients from ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2. 
Separate efficacy data was provided for 6 adult patients with primary 
brain tumors, and 1 paediatric patient. All patients had ≥ 11 months of 
efficacy follow-up at time of CCOD. All information was presented in 
NTRK Supplementary Efficacy report in eCTD Module 5, and a summary 
of adult data in D120 response to questions 74 and 159.  
Safety: Pooled patients from ALKA, STARTRK 1, STARTRK 2 and 
STARTRK-NG (paediatric). All information was presented in NTRK 
Supplementary Safety report in eCTD Module 5, and in the responses to 
D120 safety questions. 
The EU Product Information and EU-RMP have been updated as well 
based on this updated information. 
Efficacy: Pooled adult patients from ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2. 
This  included  38  additional  patients  compared  to  the  MAA  dataset 
(enrolled into ALKA, STARTRK-1 or STARTRK-2 between 30 Nov 2017 and 
31 Oct 2018). Analysis of primary efficacy endpoints (ORR, BOR and DoR 
all  by  BICR)  presented  by  tumor  type  and  follow-up  duration  were 
included in D120 response to question 74, and response to D180 question 
27. In addition, data on 8 adult patients with primary brain tumours was 
provided in response to D120 question 159, and 5 paediatric patients in 
response to D120 questions 77, 114 and 159. 
At time of D180 the EU Product Information and EU-RMP were updated 
based on this recent information for N=74. 
Safety:  Pooled  patients  from  ALKA,  STARTRK  1,  STARTRK  2  and 
STARTRK  NG.  Full  updated  safety  information  is  included  in  new  D180 
safety  supplementary  report  in  Module  5.  The  EU  Product  Information 
and EU-RMP are updated as well based on this information. 
ECOD=Enrolment cutoff date, CCOD=clinical cutoff date; MAA=marketing authorization application. FU=Follow-up. 
*  At  D120  responses,  data  regarding  a  total  of  93  subjects  (75  with  >6  months  FU)  were  provided.  However,  the  Applicant  has 
subsequently  discovered  that  one  patient  initially  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  harbouring  a  MYO5A-NTRK3  by  local  laboratory 
assessment, was shown to have a coexisting ALK fusion by Pharos central testing. This patient has therefore been excluded from the 
efficacy evaluable population due to the presence of a coexisting oncodriver, and all subsequently analyses include 74 adult  patients 
with >6 months FU.  
Methods 
Study participants  
For the efficacy analysis, data were pooled across the 3 clinical studies ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-
2 in adults (age ≥18 years). Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the NTRK 
efficacy population: 
- Have tumours that harbor an NTRK gene fusion  
 
 
 
 
 
- Received at least 1 dose of entrectinib 
- Has an extracranial solid tumor (i.e. exclusion of primary brain tumor)  
- Not treated previously with a TRK inhibitor 
Molecular characterisation of tumor tissue: see ROS1 NSCLC integrated efficacy analysis. 
Treatments 
At least one dose of entrectinib at (n=51) or above (n=3) the RP2D of 600 mg.  
Objectives/Outcomes/endpoints 
See ROS1 NSCLC integrated efficacy analysis. 
Sample size 
By assuming the true ORR by BICR was 60%, a sample size of 56 patients yield a 95% 2-sided CI with 
precision ±14% that exclude a lower limit of 30%. 
Statistical methods 
The integrated efficacy analyses were based on NTRK efficacy evaluable analysis set.  
Summary statistics with 95% 2-sided CIs properly calculated were used. 
ORR, CBR, IC-ORR: proportion and corresponding 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson exact CI. 
time-to-event endpoints (DOR, PFS, OS, IC-DOR, IC-PFS, Time to CNS progression): median, 25th, 
and 75th percentiles estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs 
were calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowly (1982) and Klein and Moeschberger 
(1997). Landmark analyses at 6, 9, and 12 months were provided with the corresponding 2-sided 95% 
CIs calculated using the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980). Kaplan-Meier curves will be 
presented. 
waterfall and swimmer plots were used to depict each patient’s best tumor response (BOR) and time 
on study, respectively, including time to first objective response by BICR (if applicable) and DOR. 
Formal significance tests were not performed. No statistical adjustment was made to address the 
sources of multiplicity associated with the integrated analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out 
overall, by study, by CNS-disease status at baseline. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess 
robustness of findings. Exploratory /sensitivity analyses in the NTRK efficacy nonevaluable analysis set 
were planned. Data from patients with primary CNS tumors were presented separately. Conduction of 
interim analysis for Breakthrough Therapy Designation Submission (27 January 2017, n=19 NTRK 
fusion-positive patients; an integrated BTD SAP version 1.0, 14 November 2016), and interim analysis 
for marketing application submission were considered.

Figure 22: Time on treatment and timing of events for responder and non-responder patients (NTRK 
efficacy evaluable analysis set; CCOD: 31 May 2018) 
Secondary endpoints 
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) 
In the Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set, 35 patients had confirmed CR (n=4), PR (n=27), and SD for at 
least 6 months (n=4), resulting in a CBR of 64.8% (95%CI 50.62, 77.32) at the CCOD 31 May 2018. 
Stable disease longer than 6 months was achieved by three patients with papillary thyroid cancer and 
by one with sarcoma (NOS). All 4 subjects have different NTRK gene fusions.  At the updated CCOD, 
stable disease for at least 6 months were 3 (as 1 papillary thyroid cancer patient out of the 4 patients 
above achieved a PR in the updated analysis).  
 
 
 
Time to CNS Progression  
Time to CNS progression was 17 months (95% CI: 14.3, NE). This data was confirmed in the updated 
analysis.It should be noted that patients without CNS lesions present at baseline per the investigator 
assessment were not required to have scheduled brain scans every 8 weeks. 
Progression Free Survival 
The K-M estimated median PFS based on the BICR assessment was 11.2 months (95% CI: 8.0, 14.9). 
Updated PFS was consistent with the K-M estimate of median PFS at the time of the MAA analysis.  
Overall Survival  
Median OS was 20.9 months (95%CI 14.9, NE), with 16 (29.6%) of patients having a dead event at 
the CCOD of 31 May 2018. In the updated analysis (CCOD 31 Oct 2018), 3 more patients had died for 
a median OS of 23.9 months (95% CI: 16.8, NE). 
Post-progression treatment: 12/54 patients received post-progression therapy with systemic agents 
other than continuation of entrectinib.  
Intracranial-specific objective response endpoints 
Within the NTRK Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set (n=54), 12 patients had CNS disease at baseline 
according to investigator. Of those, CNS disease at baseline was confirmed by BICR in 11 patients, in 7 
of those disease was measurable.

Specific information on the type of prior brain radiation therapy received was collected for 3 of the 8 
patients who received prior radiation therapy for their CNS disease. Two patients received prior whole 
brain radiotherapy (WBRT) 406 days and 160 days (>2 months) before their first dose of entrectinib 
(and had 1 PR, 1 non-CR/non-PD as their best intracranial response by BICR). For the other case 
where the type of radiation therapy was specified, the patient received WBRT with or without 
stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) 28 days before their first entrectinib dose and achieved an 
intracranial PR by BICR.

Analysis by investigator assessment (CCOD 31 May 2018) 
ORR by Investigator: ORR by investigator assessment was 53.7% (39.61, 67.38), with 29 
responding patients (CR n=5 [9.3%] PR n=24 [44.4%]). 
Concordance between BICR- and investigator-assessed response was 85.1%. Discordance in the time 
of PD (dates differed by >30 days) was observed for 8 patients (14.8%) (PD by the investigator earlier 
than by the BICR for 2 patients). 
CBR by Investigator: clinical benefit rate was 70.4%.  
 
 
DOR by Investigator: The median DOR for the 29 responders based on the investigator assessment 
was 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.2, 14.8). 
PFS by Investigator: The median PFS based on the investigator assessment was 10 months (95% CI: 
6.5, 13.8). 
Patients excluded from the efficacy evaluable analysis dataset 
A total of 13 patients were included in the NTRK efficacy non-evaluable analysis set: 
- primary CNS tumor (n=6) 
- NTRK biomarker ineligibility (n=3) 
- comorbidities (n=2) 
- ECOG PS>2 (n=1) 
- non-measurable disease (n=1) 
The overall ORR by BICR of the 13 NTRK non-evaluable subjects was 15.4% (95%CI 1.92, 45.45). The 
two responding patients corresponded to the two subjects excluded for comorbidities.  
Results in primary CNS tumors 
Among the 8 subjects with primary CNS tumors, only one achieved an objective response according to 
RANO criteria, i.e. ORR 12.5% (1/8).

PROs were only evaluated in STARTRK-2 (n=51), and were not included in the integrated efficacy 
analysis. The completion rates for QLQ-C30, QLQ-LC13 and QLQ-CR29 were high at baseline (94.1%, 
100%, and 100%, respectively) and the completion rate remained high (≥80%) at most study visits. It 
was 55% at the EOT visit (QLQ-C30). At baseline, patients reported moderate-to-high functioning 
scores for QLQ-C30. While receiving entrectinib, patients tended to maintain or improve on high 
baseline HRQoL (mean changes ranging from -4.17 to 9.72 on the GHS). For functional scales (e.g., 
physical functioning, role functioning), patients continued to report moderate-to high scores at most 
study visits, with a trend towards clinical improvement, with the exception of cognitive functioning, 
which while maintaining overall its high baseline value, trended towards some worsening over time 
above the threshold of 10-points (worst mean change score of -11.11 at Cycle 20 Day 1). Patients with 
NSCLC (n=9) and those with mCRC (n=3) reported low symptom burden at baseline at and at most 
study visits throughout the study.

Co-development of the NGS FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) with entrectinib is underway. This assay 
detects several alteration types (fusion, single nuvleotide varians, copy number variants, 
insertion/deletion), and tests coexisting oncodrivers (324 genes). F1CDx does not have coverage of 
NTRK3 intronic regions, while the most common rearrangement gene partner of NTRK3, which is ETV6, 
is covered by F1CDx.  
There are no data on concordance/discordance of molecular results in primary vs metastatic sites.   
Concomitant genetic alterations: 
Full molecular analysis is available for 40 out of 93 patients with NTRK fusion positive tumour enrolled 
up to 31 October 2018. Indeed, those subjectects were tested for co-occurrent molecular alteration per 
local screening process. Overall, 33/40 (82.5%) have detectable molecular alteration (single nucleotide 
variant, amplification, deletion/loss, rearrangement) while in 7 no concomitant alteration reported. 
According to the Applicant, such alterations apparently are not driver/ do not represent clinically 
actionable biomarker, and no relevant patterns of association of specific molecular alterations with e.g. 
tumor types, NTRK mutated gene, fusion gene, emerged. ORR in patients with tumor harbouring other 
mutations is reported to be 50%, and without other mutations was 86%. In subjects not tested for 
other mutations, ORR was 63%. All CIs are overlapping, with non-significant p-values for association.

BOR = best overall response; CR = complete respose; MASC = mammary analogue secretory carcinoma; NSCLC= non-small cell 
lung cancer; PD = disease progression; PR = partial response. 
Cases are however reported where NTRK fusion was concurrent with an oncogenic driver. A total of 3 
patients are described (excluded from the primary analysis): a NSCLC with EGFR T790M (PD as BOR), 
one patient with pancreatic cancer and KRAS G12R (SD as BOR), and a breast cancer with ALK fusion 
(apparently not among the responders). 
In ctDNA analyses, two driver mutations were found in PIK3CA – R88Q and C420R.  
Secondary resistance:  
In the NTRK efficacy evaluable population, overall 4 tumor tissue samples obtained at progression are 
available to date. NTRK1 G595R mutations in two patients and one NTRK3 G623R mutation from 
another patient were observed. No clear resistance mechanism was identified in the fourth patient.  
Paired plasma samples at baseline and at progression are being collected in STARTRK-2 patients and 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis on the FoundationOne Liquid (~70 gene NGS test) was 
peerformed. To date of the 54 NTRK fusion positive MAA patient population, 29 had an available 
sample at progression. For NTRK1/3, 10 patients had a detectable solvent front mutation from the end 
of treatment sample that was not detected in their pre-treatment sample (10/29; 34.5%), which 
included NTRK1 G595R, NTRK1 G595R, NTRK3 G623E, NTRK3 G623K and NTRK3 G623R. Additional 
short variant alterations were detected in 1 each of KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, RET, MET and EGFR. For 
ERBB2, RET, MET and EGFR, the Sponsor believes these are variant of unknown significance. For BRAF 
and KRAS, the alteration at end of study is considered oncogenic by the Applicant, V600E and G12D 
respectively.

Clinical studies in special populations 
STARTRK-Next Generation (NG) (paediatric study) 
This study is a 5-part dose escalation (phase 1) and dose expansion (phase 1b) study. Only the dose 
escalation phase 1 part A has been included in the submission. 
A Phase 1/1b, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation and Expansion Study of Entrectinib (RXDX-101) 
in  Children  and  Adolescents  with  Recurrent  or  Refractory  Solid  Tumors  and  Primary  CNS 
Tumors, with or without TRK, ROS1, or ALK Fusions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The updated protocol design as per protocol version 6 (dated 21 May 2019) is as follow. Part A, C and E 
have been closed, while Part B and D are still opened and enrolling (see figures below): 
Figure 23: Updated protocol design as of amendment version 6 (Phase 1/2) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods  
Study participants  
The Study enrols children, adolescents, and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
extracranial solid tumors (Phase 1; Part A. i.e. regardless molecular alteration), with additional 
expansion parts (Phase 1b). 
Prior to 25 October 2018 (Protocol v.5) there was no requirement for tumour to carry a fusion in NTRK, 
ROS1 or ALK. 
From protocol version 6, tumor should harbor NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions (enrollment of ALK 
fusion positive tumor will be discontinued) as determined locally by an appropriately validated assay 
performed in a CLIA-certified or equivalently-accredited diagnostic laboratory, or centrally by a 
Foundation Medicine (FM) Clinical Trial Assay. For patients enrolled via local molecular testing, 
submission of archival tumor tissue for independent central testing at FM is required. 
Treatments 
Phase I part A (dose escalation): Entrectinib was administered orally with food, once daily, in repeated 
4-week cycles. The doses levels were: 250 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2, 550 mg/m2, 750 mg/m2. (F2B 
formulation was administered in the first dose level, F1 for the subsequent dose levels). 
Phase Ib part B, C, D: Entrectinib doses at the pediatric RP2D determined in Part A. 
Phase Ib part E: entrectinib initially dosed at a -1 dose level de-escalation from the RP2D established 
in Part A. In part E, entrectinib should be mixed with age-appropriate soft food or liquid and consumed 
with fat-containing food. 
According to protocol version 6, in Parts B and D Phase 2 Portion two formulations will be used (i.e., 
F06 and F1) based upon the patient’s ability to swallow. An age-appropriate formulation will be 
introduced in the future. The recommended dose of 300 mg/m2 with F06 for pediatric patients who 
can swallow intact capsules. Based on clinical and PK data, patients in STARTRK-NG study will receive 
entrectinib as follows: 
Table 69: Revised recommended dosing per BSA category 
Sample size 
Phase 1 (Part A escalation): Planned approximately 6 – 30 patients. 
Phase 1b (Part B [Primary Brain Tumors; Gene Fusions] and D [Non-Neuroblastoma Extracranial Solid 
Tumors with NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK Gene Fusions]): 2-stage sequential testing. A true response 
rate of 20% or less is considered insufficient to warrant further study, whereas a true response rate of 
40% or more is considered worthy of further study. The number of subjects evaluated in each stage 
and the minimum number of responders needed to meet the primary endpoint were determined based 
on a sequential testing technique with at least 80% power and 1-sided α = 0.025. The first stage enroll 
 
 
 
up to 13 subjects per basket. If successful, up to additional 49 subjects are enrolled into the second 
stage. 
Phase 1b (Part C [neuroblastoma]): A Simon’s two-stage design. Stage 1 enroll 13 evaluable subjects. 
If there is one or more responder, then accrual can continue to Stage 2, enrolling 7 additional subjects 
for a total of 20 evaluable subjects. If there are 3 or more responders, then there is sufficient evidence 
of efficacy to warrant further study. This rule has 90% power, with alpha = 0.074, to reject a null 
hypothesis that the response rate is < 5% compared to an alternative hypothesis that it is > 25%. The 
expected sample size is 14.82, and the probability of early termination is 0.599. 
Phase 1b (Part A [expansion], B [non gene fusion], E): subjects not assessable for efficacy. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: to determine the MTD or RP2D of entrectinib in pediatric patients (children and 
adolescents) with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (Phase 1 Part A). 
Secondary objectives: safety, PK, systemic efficacy (ORR, DOR, TTR, CBR, PFS in parts A [expansion], 
C and D), intracranial efficacy (intracranial ORR, DOR, TTR and CNS-PFS in parts B and D). 
Exploratory Objectives: molecular analyses. 
Statistical methods 
No formal statistical hypothesis testing for Phase 1 (Part A) portion was planned. Efficacy, PK, and 
safety data were summarized using descriptive statistics. A “3+3” patient enrollment scheme was 
followed during the dose escalation. 
Results 
Recruitment 
The study (phase 1 part A) was opened in 8 centers in USA. First patient was screened on 02 May 
2016. Conduct of the study 
The protocol of the STARTRK-NG study was amended 5 times since the first version (Version 1) dated 
05 November 2015. No patients were enrolled under Protocol Version 1. 
Critical and important protocol deviations were reported in 2 patients (12.5%) (not occurred in the 
patient with NTRK gene fusion evaluated for efficacy) at the CCOD of 31 May 2018. 
Baseline data 
A total of 17 patients were screened during Phase 1 portion of the study and 1 patient failed screening 
due to withdrawal of consent. A total of 16 patients were enrolled (3 patients at 250 mg/m2; 3 
patients at 400 mg/m2; 7 patients at 550 mg/m2; and 3 patients at 750 mg/m2). Only 3 patients had 
gene fusions (EML4-NTRK3, TFG-ROS1, DCTN1-ALK). Only those 3 subjects achieve an objective 
response.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: DLT  
A total of 15 patients were evaluable for DLTs, of whom 14 patients were <18 years of age. A DLT of 
Grade 2 blood creatinine increased occurred at 550 mg/m2, and 2 DLTs (Grade 2 dysgeusia and Grade 
3 pulmonary oedema) at 750 mg/m2. After the the decision of dose reduction from 750 mg/m2 to 550 
mg/m2 was made, additional DLTs of Grade 2 blood creatinine and Grade 3 pulmonary oedema (the 
latter in the same patient of 750 mg/m2) occurred. Based on STARTRK-NG safety results, the dose 
 
 
550 mg/m2 was declared as MTD and selected as RP2D for further evaluation in the Phase 1b portion 
of the study for patients able to swallow capsules.

2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The Applicant is seeking two separate therapeutic indications for entrectinib: one in NTRK fusion-
positive solid tumour and one in ROS1 positive NSCLC.  
To support each indication, the Applicant presented two integrated datasets (one for NTRK fusion 
positive solid tumours [n=54], and one for ROS1 positive NSCLC [n=53]), obtained by pooling 
efficacy data of patients with the gene fusion/tumour types of interest from the three adult studies. As 
per CHMP request, results from updated datasets including additional patients were presented during 
the procedure (n=94 for ROS1 NSCLC and n=74 for NTRK-fusion positive solid tumours). 
The paediatric study, relevant for the NTRK indication, was not included in the pooling. Paediatric 
efficacy data have been presented separately. 
Further, a real word comparison of entrectinib vs. crizotinib has been presented as supportive for the 
ROS1 NSCLC indication. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In ALKA, patients were enrolled and assigned to three different dosing schedule of entrectinib. The 
primary objective of ALKA study was to determine the first cycle DLTs and the MTD. No DLTs were 
reported and, consequently, no MTD could be defined based on ALKA study for any of 3 schedules 
investigated. 
STARTRK-1 included a dose escalation, with first cycle DLTs, MTD, and determination of a biologically 
effective dose and RP2D as primary objectives, and a dose expansion segment. A total of 76 patients 
were recruited and assigned to 7 cohorts in the dose escalation. Three patients in the 800 mg dose 
group had 1 DLT each.  
Both phase I ALKA and STARTRK-1 studies were interdependent, in that dose escalation decisions in 
one study affected the conduct of the other one. Based on the overall available data, 600 mg once 
daily on a continuous daily dosing was declared as the RP2D of entrectinib. 
STARTRK-2 was designed to enrol patients based on the results of local or central molecular testing 
on the baskets NTRK, ROS1, ALK and Non Evaluable, further divided in several sub-baskets. The 
inclusion/exclusion criteria of the 3 studies ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2 appear overall rather 
homogeneous. All patients received the RP2D of entrectinib 600 mg once daily continuously in 4-weeks 
cycles until documented radiographic progression as assessed by BICR, unacceptable toxicity or 
consent withdrawal.   
The primary endpoint was ORR by BICR using RECIST v1.1. Among secondary endpoints, there were 
DOR, PFS, OS, intracranial tumor response and CNS-PFS, QoL. For each basket evaluable for the 
primary endpoint, up to 62 patients were expected to be enrolled in the 2-stage sequential testing 
design (Part A). Through the adopted sample size and stopping rules, if the true response rate was 
<=20%, the probability of stopping enrollment during the first stage was 75%. Conversely, if the true 
response rate was >40%, then the probability that enrollment was terminated during the first stage is 
equal to 17%. Moreover, for the ROS1-Positive, ROS1 Inhibitor-Naïve NSCLC Basket, based on 
expected response rate to crizotinib, after completion of the two stage design (Part A), the enrollment 
of additional 90 patients in further study (Part B) was planned to rule out a statistically significant 
BICR-ORR<=50%, by assuming the true ORR is at least 65%, power of 80% and 1-sided alpha=0.025. 
The result of the Fisher’s Exact Test did not show statistical significant difference in ORR in Part A and 
Part B. 
Results in CSR STARTRK-2 study likely derive from data pooled from Part A and Part B studies, with a 
statistical analysis objective resembling that of the Part B study. In Part B study, additional patients - 
respect to Part A study - were planned to be enrolled, with a further integrated analysis of Part A and 
Part B planned to increase statistical power. The dataset used for analysis in the interim CSR is 
selected through previous testing.  
The study was conducted worldwide and started recruitment on 16 November 2015, and is still ongoing 
at the time of the opinion. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ROS1 positive NSCLC 
The main core of data presented in the original submission to support the sought indication of 
entrectinib in patients with ROS1-positive, advanced or metastatic NSCLC is represented by 53 adult 
patients with ROS1-inhibitor naïve ROS1-positive NSCLC and measurable disease, treated with at 
least one dose of entrectinib (at or above the RP2D of 600 mg) and having at least 12 months follow-
 
 
up from the time of first response, pooled from the phase 1 studies ALKA and STARTRK-1, and the 
phase 2 study STARTRK-2 (ROS1 NSCLC Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set). The median survival follow 
up was 15.54 months. This dataset was updated during the procedure with a 5 months later clinical 
cut-off date (median survival follow-up of 20.6 months), which overall confirmed prior results. Later 
on, the Applicant submitted a larger dataset with n=94 patients (median follow-up 20.3 months) with 
a minimum follow up of 12 months. Data for n=161 patients with a minimum follow up of 6 months 
have also been submitted. 
The integrated analysis was not pre-specified in any of the individual study protocols, but was 
developed after the start of the STARTRK-2. The eligibility criteria and endpoints in the integrated 
analysis plan (original dated February 2017) were based on the Phase II STARTRK-2 eligibility criteria 
and study endpoints.  
The molecular characterisation of tumor tissue was determined by several assay methods across the 
three pooled trials, including locally performed IHC, FISH, qPCR, and NGS, and central NGS testing.  
Only patients harbouring gene fusions in NTRK, ROS1, or ALK predicted to translate into a fusion 
protein with a functional kinase domain were considered to have a positive gene-fusion status, while 
patients with other types of molecular alterations were not considered to be positive for a gene fusion. 
The co-occurrence of other oncogenic drivers was not systematically evaluated.  
The primary endpoints were ORR according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR (based on confirmed responses), 
DOR and BOR. Secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, CBR, and time to CNS progression. In addition, 
intracranial-specific endpoints (IC-ORR, IC-DOR and IC-PFS) were evaluated in the subpopulation 
presented with CNS at baseline, with the aim of assessing the intracranial activity of entrectinib. ORR 
by BICR was determined in a prospective manner in the phase II study STARTRK-2, but on a 
retrospective basis for those patients included in the efficacy-evaluable patient population enrolled in 
the phase I studies ALKA and STARTRK-1, whose tumor images were reviewed by BICR 
retrospectively.  
Sample size for the integrated efficacy analysis (at least 50 patients were planned) was calculated to 
guarantee a 95% 2-sided confidence interval for the ORR which excluded a lower limit of 50% 
considered clinically meaningful. An ORR of 70%, and a precision of 17% were assumed in 
calculations. Sample size calculation for the integrated analysis was performed when efficacy results 
from each clinical study included in the integrated efficacy analyses were already partially available 
(ALKA and STARTRK-1 results were reported by Drilon A et al, Cancer Discov. 2017 Apr), and number 
of responders in STARTRK-2 trial was closely monitored by the Sponsor’s study team to determine if a 
success or stopping criteria were met. True ORR in integrated efficacy analysis (70%) differed from 
that hypothesized in Part B of STARTRK-2 (65%), with sensible reduction of needed sample size. The 
Applicant justified assumption on true ORR in view of the background context that crizotinib was 
approved. However, some preliminary efficacy results for entrectinib were also already available, and it 
is not possible to exclude that such data might have also have affected other parameters used in 
sample size calculation (precision). The exclusion criterion based on a history of prior TKI treatment 
targeting the same fusion of interest of entrectinib was suggested from results of previous efficacy 
analyses carried out on data of ALKA and STARTRK-1 studies (Drilon et al. 2017) used in integrated 
efficacy analysis. Although the rationale of this exclusion criterion based on the lack of response is 
acknowledged and is fully acceptable in the context of exploratory studies, there are concerns 
regarding the introduction of possible selection biases when used to select study population from an 
already collected dataset. The concerns regard the possible selection biases derived from post-hoc 
exclusion of patients based on their observed response in the study. These concerns can only be 
overcome by the confirmation of results in an independent prospectively analysed data set including 
patients enrolled based on the refined criteria.  
 
 
Six (6) months of follow-up is sufficient to capture the vast majority of responses.  
Entrectinib was to be used in patients naive to ROS1 inhibitors. About 35% of subjects did not receive 
any other prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting. Treatment with entrectinib was allowed 
after disease progression if the patient was perceived by the investigator to derive clinical benefit, 
which occurred in up to half of the patients. However, based on available data it is not possible to 
evaluate the benefit of post-progression treatment with entrectinib. Treatment should therefore be 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
In the ROS1 NSCLC Efficacy Evaluable analysis (n=53), ORR was 77.4% (95%CI: 63.79, 87.72), with 
3 CRs (5.7%). No durable SDs have been observed. ORR assessed by investigator was overall 
comparable to BICR. The interpretation of ORR subgroup analysis is hampered by the limited number 
of patients in most of the subgroups. The main observations are an apparently higher response rate in 
treatment-naïve patients compared to pre-treated ones, and the lower the ECOG-PS is the lower the 
response rate. Median DOR by BICR was 24.6 months (95%CI 11.4, 34.8). With 25 (47.2%) subjects 
with a PFS event, median PFS by BICR was 19.0 months (95%CI: 12.2, 36.6), but shorter by 
investigator (15.5 months). OS was very immature (9 [17%] patients with OS event), median not yet 
estimable. The interpretation of time-to-event endpoints in single arm trials is intrinsically limited. 
As patients with no CNS metastases documented at screening had brain imaging only when clinically 
indicated, assessment of CNS progression might be delayed. As a result, the detection of disease 
progression in the brain could have been potentially underestimated in subjects with no baseline CNS 
disease, moreover time to CNS progression is difficult to be interpreted. Overall, the first progression 
occurred intracranially in 36% of subjects who progressed during the study. Higher incidence of 
progression in the brain as 1st site was observed in patient with baseline CNS disease (65%) 
compared to patients with no baseline CNS disease (15%). The interpretation of these data is difficult 
due to the small number of subjects. Furthermore, it is difficult to contextualise such data. In patients 
with CNS disease at baseline by BICR, while systemic ORR was similar, DOR and median PFS were 
lower compared to patients without baseline CNS metastases. Although based on a limited number of 
patients, entrectinib does not appear to dramatically improve the prognosis of subjects with brain 
metastases. In patients with brain metastases, IC-ORR was 55% (75% in subjects with measurable 
disease), and about 1 year of median IC-DOR. This confirms the poorer prognosis of patients with 
baseline CNS metastases. 
No responses were achieved in subjects with CNS disease when RT was performed ≥2 months from 
starting entrectinib however intracranial responses were observed in patients who had brain RT within 
2 months from the first entrectinib dose. Acknowledging the limited number of patients, while it is 
encouraging that intracranial responses are seen in patient who did not have RT before, a possible 
overestimation of IC-ORR due to subjects with RT within 2 months (i.e. possible effect of RT) cannot be 
excluded, making difficult to determine the real contribution of entrectinib to the observed IC-ORR. 
Therefore, the group “No brain RT or brain RT >2 months” is considered to better estimate the 
intracranial response.   
Only 3 patients responded to treatment out of 27 subjects who received entrectinib after other ROS1 
inhibitors (3/27=11.1%). Among those subjects, 19 patients experienced CNS-only progression while 
on crizotinib, and of those 2 subjects responded (RR 10.5%). Thus, the wording of the indication 
reflects that subjects should not have received prior ROS1 inhibitors. 
In order to address the above limitations and in order to further characterise the efficacy of entrectinib 
in patients with baseline CNS disease as well as to generate some comparative safety data, the MAH 
should conduct and submit the results of a randomised controlled trial versus crizotinib in treatment 
naïve ROS1 NSCLC patients (PAES in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 
 
 
357/2014 indent c)). The primary endpoint will be PFS in the subgroup of patients with baseline CNS 
disease with CNS metastases (see Annex II).  
Patient reported outcomes (PROs) were evaluated in the 37 ROS1 NSCLC patients in the context of 
STARTRK-2. A trend toward symptoms improvement since cycle 2 is suggested in this subset. An 
apparent declining in cognitive functioning within the first cycles is of concern, due to the Cognitive 
Disorders reported in clinical trials with entrectinib. 
Efficacy results from a larger dataset with n=94 patients (all having at least 12 months of follow-up) 
were: ORR 73.4% (63.3, 82.0) (11.7% CR and 61.7% PR), median DOR 16.5 months (14.6, 28.6) 
(52% of patients with DOR event), median PFS 16.8 months (12.0, 21.4) (57% of patients with PFS 
event), median OS NE (28.3, NE) (26.6% of patients with OS event). In the 34 subjects having CNS 
metastases by BICR, IC-ORR was 50% (32.4, 67.6), IC-DOR 12.9 months (5.6, 22.1) (65% of patients 
with IC-DOR event), IC-PFS 7.7 months (4.6, 15.7) (73.5% of patients with IC-PFS event). 
A pattern of decreasing efficacy estimates over time has been observed, with an ORR of 79% and a 
DoR of 24 months in the 53 patients submitted in the original MAA, an ORR of 73% and DoR of 16.5 
months in the 94 patients proposed by the applicant, and an ORR of 67% and a DoR of 15.7 months in 
161 patients with 6 months of follow-up at CCOD 1 MAY 2019. As this is an application for approval 
based on pooled data from open-label exploratory studies, no particular pivotal population can be 
acknowledged. The dataset with 161 patients is considered more relevant as it is larger and a more 
complete representation of ROS1-positive NSCLC patients treated with entrectinib, and is reflected in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The magnitude of this effect is such that it is expected to result in clinically relevant effects. 
A comparative analysis of the integrated clinical data from ROS1-positive NSCLC patients treated with 
entrectinib versus real world data (RWD) from matched ROS1-positive NSCLC patients treated with 
crizotinib extracted from the US Flatiron Database was submitted as supportive evidence (study 
WO40977) with the aim to compensate the lack of a direct comparative data of entrectinib vs crizotinib 
from a randomized clinical trial. Time to treatment discontinuation was the primary endpoint. The 
proposed RW analysis as the only comparative evidence between entrectinib and crizotinib is not 
considered a robust demonstration of the superiority of entrectinib over the approved agent in ROS1 
positive NSCLC ROS1 inhibitor naïve due to important limitation of the study design and real word data 
collection, and it is not sufficient to change the overall conclusion.  
NTRK gene fusion positive solid tumours 
The main core of data supporting the sought “site and histology independent” indication of entrectinib 
in patients with NTRK fusion positive solid tumour, in adults and paediatric patients, is represented by 
54 adult patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumour and measurable disease, receiving at least 
one dose of entrectinib across the three studies ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2 (NTRK Efficacy 
Evaluable Analysis Set), and having at least 6 months follow-up. This dataset was updated during the 
procedure with a 5 months later clinical cut-off date. Later on, a larger dataset with 74 adult patients 
was submitted.  
Primary brain tumors, as well as paediatric patients with NTRK gene fusion positive disease have been 
excluded from the main analysis and presented separately. 
The integrated analyses were not prespecified in the individual study protocols. Considering the rarity 
of the patient population, an integrated statistical analysis plan was developed to maximize the 
number of gene fusion-positive patients available for safety and efficacy analyses, including patients 
from the Phase I studies. Out of a total of 54 patients included in the NTRK integrated efficacy dataset, 
 
 
only 3 subjects are coming from the phase I trials, while 51 were enrolled in the STARTRK-2 basket 
study.  
In the extended dataset of n=74 patients with NTRK-fusion positive extracranial solid tumor with >6 
months of follow up, the overall ORR was 63.5% (95%CI 51.5, 74.4) and median DOR 12.9 months 
(95%CI 9.3, NE). ORR by tumour type is difficult to interpret as based on a small number of patients in 
each subgroup. Different tumour types exhibit different ORR, ranging from 0% to 100%. The estimates 
by tumour types are not robust due to the small sample size of individual subgroups. Although 
definitive conclusion on efficacy across tumour types cannot yet be reached, the ORR in the overall 
population does not appear to represent the expected response in each tumour type. Indeed, higher 
response rates can be observed in MASC (⁓90%) and breast secretory (100%), both characterized by 
NTRK-gene fusion. High response rate is also seen in NSCLC (⁓70%), where although NTRK fusions 
are rare, several targeted therapy have shown high response rate in NSCLC with molecular alterations. 
On the contrary, quite low ORR is seen in CRC, which is also confirmed in the updated dataset (⁓30%). 
Far limited responses are achieved in the CNS primary tumour (ORR ⁓10%). The uncertainties on the 
drug effect according to tumour type have been reflected in the product information (see sections 4.4 
and 5.1 of the SmPC).  
With more than half of the subjects having a PFS event, median PFS by BICR was 11.2 months (95%CI 
8.0, 15.7). Median OS was 23.9 months (95% CI: 16, NE), with about 30% of patients with death 
event, which is immature to date. The interpretation of time-to-event endpoints in single arm trials is 
intrinsically limited. Moreover, the impact of treatment on PFS and OS cannot be disentangled from the 
prognosis of the different tumour types included in the integrated NTRK dataset. In this regard, in the 
attempt to contextualize results with the prognosis, subgroup analyses by tumour type have been 
compared with the available SOCs for each disease. Comparison of TTP in relation to post-progression 
survival has not been provided instead. The interpretation of the results by tumor types is hampered 
by the very low number of subjects in each subgroup, for some disease only one patient is available. 
While the results of entrectinib in ORR and PFS could appear as broadly comparable with the available 
treatment options in later line for each tumor types, the data are far from comprehensive to reach 
meaningful conclusion. Hence, additional data are being requested as part of specific obligations to the 
marketing authorisation (see “Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA”). 
CNS metastasis 
Median time to CNS progression was 17 months. As patients with no CNS metastases documented at 
screening had brain imaging only when clinically indicated, assessment of CNS progression might be 
delayed, therefore time to CNS progression in difficult to be interpreted. None of the patient 
progressed while on study had intracranial first site of progression, regardless the presence of CNS 
disease at baseline or prior response to entrectinib. Given the high heterogeneity of the primary 
tumors included in the dataset, it is difficult to draw conclusion from this data. 
Overall, CNS disease at baseline was confirmed by BICR in 11 patients. A similar systemic ORR to 
entrectinib regardless the presence of CNS disease at baseline by BICR is observed. Six of the 11 
patients with CNS disease at baseline by BICR achieved an intracranial objective response, which was 
observed regardless the use and the timing of prior RT. This is an indication of the activity of 
entrectinib on CNS metastases, however the number of patients is very limited (see section 5.1 of the 
SmPC).  
Tumour types 
A total of 10 tumour types are included in the NTRK integrated efficacy analysis for entrectinib, with 
sarcoma and NSCLC being the most represented. Among the tumour types included in the analysis, 
there are rare cancer types highly enriched for NTRK fusion (NTRK gene fusion prevalence of >90%), 
 
 
such as mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) of the salivary glands, and secretory breast 
carcinoma, all cases carrying ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. Tumour types with an “intermediate” 
prevalence of NTRK gene fusions (5%-25%) represented were papillary thyroid carcinoma and GIST. 
Other tumour types included are more common tumours having a low prevalence of NTRK fusions 
(<1%). Gene fusions mostly involved NTRK3 gene followed by NTRK1, while NTRK2 appears rarely. 
The most common gene fusion partner was ETV6-NTRK3.  
Previous therapy 
The majority of patients had received a previous anticancer systemic therapy in any setting, mostly 
chemotherapy. Approximately 25% of subjects received entrectinib as first line systemic treatment in 
the metastatic setting, however most of the patients received entrectinib after the standard drugs 
indicated in each disease administered in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting. 12/54 patients received 
anticancer treatment post-progression. However none of the enrolled patients received prior NTRK 
inhibitors and this was reflected in the wording of the indication (see section 4.1 of the SmPC). 
Surgical resection 
It is acknowledged that some patients presenting with a disease in which cure through surgery is the 
therapeutic goal such as locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma, could have a better outcome with 
cytoreduction of the tumour with larotrectinib followed by surgical resection, thus avoiding disfiguring 
amputation and permitting limb salvage. This justifies the inclusion of the following criterion “where 
surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity” in the wording of the indication (see section 
4.1 of the SmPC). 
Concomitant genetic mutations 
The molecular characterization of tumours to detect NTRK gene fusion has been performed by several 
assay methods (IHC, FISH, RT-PCR, NGS) locally, or centrally (NGS Trailblaze Pharos platform). Based 
on Foundation One data as well as from available entrectinib data, it appears that concomitant genetic 
mutations occurr frequently in tumour with NTRK fusion, but in most of the cases they are not driver/ 
have no clinically actionable biomarker. Full molecular analysis is currently available for 40 out of 93 
patients with NTRK fusion positive tumour enrolled up to 31 October 2018. Overall, 33/40 (82.5%) 
have detectable molecular alteration (single nucleotide variant, amplification, deletion/loss, 
rearrangement). Relevant patterns of association of specific molecular alterations with e.g. tumour 
types, NTRK mutated gene, fusion gene, apparently do not emerge. No statistical association between 
entrectinib response and the presence of additional molecular alteration was found. Response rate 
according to presence/absence of other molecular alteration (50% with, 86% without) is difficult to 
interpret, due to the limited number of patients tested and the presence of other confounding factors, 
such as the heterogeneity in term of tumour types/histologies. The frequent presence (90%) of 
concomitant molecular alteration was shown also from NGS analysis using ctDNA ran on a ~70-gene 
cancer related test (FOneLiquid). The response was apparently not driven by the presence of molecular 
alterations.  Data are still limited to draw conclusion, though, and further data on tumour genomic 
profiling by plasma and/or tissue will be submitted post authorisation (see SOB). With regards to gene 
fusion partner, with the exception of ETV6 (25 patients), there are too few patients within each fusion 
partner (range 1-4) to conclude on response by fusion partner. The co-development of the 
FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) with entrectinib is underway, and any patient who is tested by F1CDx will 
obtain a comprehensive genomic profile. 
Secondary resistance 
Available data on secondary resistance include 4 tumour tissue samples obtained at progression, in 
which NTRK1 G595R mutation was observed in two patients and one NTRK3 G623R mutation observed 
in another patient. No clear resistance mechanism was identified in the fourth patient. By analysing 
 
 
ctDNA in paired plasma samples at baseline and at progression with FoundationOne Liquid (~70 gene 
NGS test), 10/29 patients had a detectable solvent front mutation.  
Prior treatments with other drugs that inhibit the same kinases may confer resistance to entrectinib. 
Resistance mutations in the TRK kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include 
NTRK1 (G595R, G667C) and NTRK3 (G623R, G623E and G623K). Resistance mutations in the ROS1 
kinase domain identified following entrectinib discontinuation include G2032R, F2004C and F2004I. The 
molecular causes for primary resistance to entrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if the 
presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy of 
TRK inhibition. This issue will be further investigated in the context of a specific obligation (see below). 
Patient reported outcomes (PROs) 
PROs were evaluated in the context of STARTRK-2. At baseline, patients have high HRQoL, as well as 
good functions and low symptoms burden, and apparently no meaningful changes were reported 
throughout the study. As observed among analysed ROS1 NSCLC patients, PROs data seems indicate a 
trend towards a cognitive functioning decline has been flagged and it is still considered consistent with 
the Cognitive Disorders AEs reported.   
Additional expert consultation 
Not applicable 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
STARTRK-Next Generation (NG) is a phase 1/1b dose-escalation/expansionstudy of entrectinib in 
children and adolescents with recurrent or refractory solid tumors and primary CNS tumors. In the 
dose escalation part, the 550 mg/m2 dose level was declared as MTD and selected as RP2D, for 
patients able to swallow capsules. 
Up to 31 October 2018 (enrollment and clinical cut-off date), a total of 29 paediatric patients have 
been enrolled in STARTRK-NG study, of whom 7 with NTRK fusion-positive tumors, aged from 4 
months to 9 years. They presented with different 6 tumor types (4 CNS primary, 2 infantile 
fibrosarcomaand a metastatic melanoma), mostly with NTRK3 gene fusion. Of those 7 pediatric 
subjects, 6 were evaluable for efficacy (one had too short follow-up), all achieved an objective 
response by BICR (2 CR and 4 PR), with DOR ranged between 1.8 and 9.3 months. 
Two additional children with NTRK fusion positive solid tumor received entrectinib in the context of 
compassionate use programme, a 6 years old male with high grade astrocytoma and a 1.5 years old 
male with infantile fibrosarcoma, both achieving PR according to investigator assessment.   
Although the available efficacy results in paediatric patients appear promising, they have been 
obtained in a very heterogeneus and small population so they have to be interpreted with caution, and 
it is difficult to draw conclusion based on such limited data. 
The final indication that was considered acceptable includes patients aged 12 to 18 years .  No efficacy 
data for entrectinib in NTRK solid tumour are available in this age group however the PK simulations 
performed for adolescents within BSA 1.1-1.5 m2 showed that the exposure is within those obtained in 
adults (see clinical pharmacology). The activity of entrectinib in adolescent is considered established 
based on extrapolation of data obtained in adult patients with NTRK fusion positive solid tumours. 
 
 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The Applicant requested a Conditional Marketing Authorisation, providing a justification for CMA for the 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumors indication only. The following Specific Obligations related to NTRK 
indication have been proposed, which are considered acceptable.  
“Specific Obligation number 1 (SOB-1) by 31 March 2027 
In order to further confirm the histology-independent efficacy of entrectinib in adult and paediatric 
patients, the MAH should submit a pooled analysis for an increased sample size of NTRK fusion-positive 
patients from the ongoing studies STARTRK-2, STARTRK-NG and any additional clinical trial conducted 
according to an agreed protocol. The MAH should submit the results of an interim safety and efficacy 
analysis of the NTRK efficacy-evaluable adult and paediatric patients including adolescents that are 
available as per integrated statistical analysis plan. 
These data will allow to more precisely characterize the benefit/lack of efficacy of entrectinib across 
tumour types, to increase precision of the estimates for ORR and DOR with prospectively collected data 
an sufficient follow-up.  
The current dataset will be expanded with at least 200 additional patients with NTRK fusion positive 
solid tumours across histology (61 already recruited). Between 9-20 patients for the common tumour 
types where NTRK fusions are rare (lung cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer and non-secretory 
breast cancer) will be enrolled, plus additional adult patients in all other indications, including primary 
CNS patients. About 30 paediatric patients are planned to be presented within the SOB (i.e. 22-27 
patients <12 years and 3-5 patients ≥12 years).  
Lack of efficacy within a certain tumour type has been defined as less than 4 responders in a group of 
sequentially enrolled 13 patients (i.e., ORR <30%), which would trigger information to EMA. If a new 
or underrepresented tumour type has not reached ≥ 13 patients, the Applicant will continue enrollment 
of patients with this tumour type until the SOB1 deadline, informing EMA about the recruitment status 
at the time of the annual renewals. Any additional efficacy analyses results that would have to be done 
upon request from any other health authority will be also shared with EMA. 
The target final date for the SOB is 31 March 2027, projected based on the recruitment rate observed 
so far and taking into account competitive trials and new therapies. However, an interim safety and 
efficacy analysis will be also submitted, latest by the end of 2023. 
“Specific Obligation number 2 (SOB-2) by 31 March 2027 
In order to further investigate the impact of the presence/absence of other molecular alteration on the 
efficacy of entrectinib, the MAH should submit the results from tumour genomic profiling by plasma 
and/or tissue when possible at baseline and progression together with clinical outcomes association per 
tumour histology for the patients from the updated pooled analysis. 
The molecular data available so far are too limited to draw definitive conclusion. Therefore, in order to 
address uncertainties with regard to several molecular aspects, the Applicant will continue to collect 
plasma for circulating tumour DNA analysis and tumour tissue when medically feasible, and will use 
NGS for the analysis. The SOB2 will allow a more precise characterization of entrectinib magnitude of 
effect across tumours based on biomarker status. Such data can therefore clarify entrectinib 
activity/response according to NTRK fusion status and partners, concurrent oncogenic driver 
mutations, and concurrent additional alterations. Data on molecular mechanism of primary and 
secondary resistance, as well as concordance beteween plasma and tissue molecular data, are also 
expected from this SOB. 
 
 
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
ROS1 positive NSCLC 
The available efficacy and safety data support a positive absolute B/R for entrectinib in the treatment 
of adult patients with ROS1 positive NSCLC not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitor. Uncertainties 
over efficacy and safety have been alleviated by updated data provided by the Applicant, although still 
in the context of the intrinsic limitations of pivotal data based on SAT. 
Based on indirect comparison, the antitumor activity of entrectinib seems to be comparable to the only 
currently authorised therapy for ROS1 positive NSCLC. Entrectinib is therefore considered to be a 
valuable treatment option to be offered to patients with ROS1 positive NSCLC in addition to the 
approved crizotinib.  
The CHMP considers that the efficacy of entrectinib in ROS1+ NSCLC has been established based on 
the data provided, and the magnitude of this effect is such that it is expected to result in clinically 
relevant benefit. Furthermore, while data on the CNS activity of entrectinib are encouraging, a further 
characterisation of efficacy in this subgroup of patients who will develop brain metastases is required 
post authorisation.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further characterise the efficacy of entrectinib in patients with baseline CNS disease, 
the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a randomised controlled trial versus crizotinib in 
treatment naïve ROS1 NSCLC patients. The primary endpoint will be PFS in the subgroup of patients 
with baseline CNS disease with CNS metastases. The targeted filing of the clinical study report is 2027.  
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours 
The overall response rate observed in the pooled data set is deemed clinically meaningful even though 
the estimates by tumour types are not robust due to the small sample sizes of individual subgroups 
and the limited number of tumour types. The available data suggest that the effect size may vary 
depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant genomic alterations. Responses appears durable 
overall, with median >12 months. A higher degree of uncertainty could be considered acceptable for 
subjects with no satisfactory treatment options (i.e., for which clinical benefit has not been established, 
or where such treatment options have been exhausted). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the histology-independent efficacy of entrectinib in adult and paediatric 
patients, the MAH should submit a pooled analysis for an increased sample size of NTRK fusion-positive 
patients from the ongoing studies STARTRK-2, STARTRK-NG and any additional clinical trial conducted 
according to an agreed protocol. The MAH should submit the results of an interim safety and efficacy 
analysis of the NTRK efficacy-evaluable adult and paediatric patients including adolescents that are 
available as per integrated statistical analysis plan at the latest by Q4 2023. 
- In order to further investigate the impact of the presence/absence of other molecular alteration on 
the efficacy of entrectinib, the MAH should submit the results from tumour genomic profiling by plasma 
and/or tissue when possible at baseline and progression together with clinical outcomes association per 
tumour histology for the patients from the updated pooled analysis. The results should be submitted by 
31 March 2027. 
 
 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety data supporting this application are derived primarily from three ongoing adult 
studies ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2 and one paediatric Study STARTRK-NG in children 
adolescents, and young adults. Safety data from the above mentioned studies have been pooled and 
analysed collectively as the integrated safety population. An overview of these four studies can be 
found in Table 13 and Figure 24. The analysis set of the safety population submitted in the marketing 
authorisation application included 355 patients with a CCOD of 31 May 2018. During the procedure, the 
applicant submitted an updated safety population including 504 patients with a CCOD of 31 October 
2018. 
Figure 24: Patient Population and Analysis Sets for Integrated Safety Analysis enrolled up to 31 October 
2018 
In total, 508 patients (including 29 paediatric patients) were enrolled in studies ALKA, STARTRK-1, 
STARTRK-2, and STARTRK-NG up to 31 October 2018 and comprised the enrolled population. All safety 
analyses were performed using the integrated safety population, defined as all patients enrolled in 
studies ALKA, STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2, and STARTRK-NG who received at least one dose of 
entrectinib, with data collected up to the CCOD (31 October 2018). Of the enrolled population, 4 
patients did not receive entrectinib and were therefore excluded from the integrated safety population 
which consisted of 504 patients; including 475 adult and 29 paediatric patients with solid tumours. In 
the analyses presented in this report, 4 patients have been reassigned to adult and paediatric groups 
based on their actual age. Adult patients are now defined as those patients ≥18 years of age while 
paediatric patients are defined as those patients <18 years of age. 
Supportive safety data are also separately provided from the following sources: 
– available safety data for an additional 10 paediatric patients from Study STARTRK NG who were 
enrolled between 1 December 2017 and 31 May 2018. 
– safety data for 8 patients treated with entrectinib under a single-case compassionate use program 
and from 14 adult patients from the Phase I Study RXDX-101-14, which evaluated the potential 
pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between entrectinib and midazolam in patients with advanced solid 
tumours. These supportive patient data were not integrated with the overall safety population because 
of their different purpose and limited sample size they would contribute to the analysis 
 
 
 
–  safety data  for healthy  subjects from  10  dedicated clinical pharmacology studies. These supportive 
safety data in healthy subjects were not integrated with the overall safety population due to different 
population, study design, and limited exposure to entrectinib treatment. 
Patient exposure 
As of the CCOD for the analyses presented in this report, a total of 327 patients (64.9%) in the overall 
integrated safety population (n=504) had discontinued treatment. The primary reason for 
discontinuation of entrectinib was disease progression (247 patients [75.5% of those who 
discontinued]), followed by AEs (44 patients [13.5%]). Other reasons accounted for less than 10% of 
patients who discontinued treatment; 235 patients out of the 508 enrolled patients had discontinued 
from the study, 20 patients had completed the study, and 253 patients were still on study. The most 
common reason for study discontinuation was the death of the patient (50.2% [118/235] of patients 
who discontinued the study). 
Most patients received all their planned doses of entrectinib, with few missed doses; the median 
number of missed doses was 1.0 (range: 0.0-50.0). The median duration of exposure to entrectinib in 
the overall integrated safety population, including the 149 additional patients enrolled after 30 
November 2017, was 5.5 months (range: 0.0-42.1 months) corresponding to a median of 7.0 cycles 
(range: 1-92). See the Table below for additional details. 
Table 73: Summary of Extent of Exposure to Entrectinib in the Integrated Safety Population (CCOD 31 
October 2018) 
Adverse events 
Almost all patients (99.4%) experienced at least one AE (all grade) during treatment. Most AEs 
requiring intervention were managed with dose interruption (45.9% of patients) or dose reduction (i.e. 
28.2% of patients) (see Table below).  
 
 
 
Table 74: Overview of adverse events in the integrated safety population (CCOD: 31 May 2018; safety 
evaluable population) 
In the overall integrated safety population, the safety profile of entrectinib was generally comparable 
across all exposure groups with all (100%) patients who were exposed to entrectinib 6 to 12 months 
and 12 months and 98.9% of those exposed to entrectinib 6 months experiencing at least one AE. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of patients are summarised in the Table below.

Treatment-related AEs  
The causality relationship of study drug to an AE was assessed by the Investigator. An AE is reported 
as related to entrectinib if the investigator assessed it as possibly, probably, or definitely related. 
Most (91.5%) patients in the overall integrated safety population had at least one AE that was 
considered by the investigator to be related to entrectinib treatment.  The most frequently reported 
(≥10% of patients) treatment-related AEs by PT were dysgeusia (41.4%), fatigue (27.9%), dizziness 
(25.4%), constipation (23.7%), diarrhoea (22.8%), nausea (20.8%), weight increased (19.4%), 
paraesthesia (18.9%), blood creatinine increased (15.2%), myalgia (15.2%), oedema peripheral 
(14.1%), vomiting (13.5%), arthralgia (12.4%), anaemia (12.1%), and AST increased (11.0%). 
Adverse drug reactions 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were selected based on Sponsor causality assessment and a frequency 
of  ≥10%  for  individual  preferred  terms  or  group  of  preferred  terms  pooled  by  medical  concept.  Less 
frequent events (i.e., <10%) could also be ADRs if supported by clinical experience, medical judgment, 
preclinical  findings,  or other  data  from  the  literature.  The  ADR  frequencies  shown  in  Table  below  are 
based on the expanded integrated safety population of N=504 patients.

AEs of special interest  
AEs of special interest were not pre-defined in the study protocols. Selected AEs were defined by the 
Applicant on the basis of previous clinical experience, mechanism of action and safety profile from 
drugs with similar targets. Selected AEs were defined using Standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs), 
where applicable. If no SMQs were available, MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC), High Level Term 
(HLT), High Level Group Term (HLGT), Roche Standard MedDRA Adverse Event Grouped Terms 
(AEGTs), or PT were used (see Table below).

Neurologic Toxicity 
Consistent with entrectinib’s CNS activity and the known association of TRK receptors’ involvement in 
neuronal development and maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous system, neurologic AEs 
have been observed in patients treated with entrectinib. Neurologic toxicity was defined as any AE 
from either nervous system disorder SOC or psychiatric disorders SOC. Neurological AEs were reported 
in 88.7% of patients in the overall integrated safety population. Most patients experienced events that 
were of Grade 1 (45.4%) or Grade 2 (26.5%) in severity. The most frequently reported (≥10% of 
patients) AEs (all grade) by PT were dysgeusia (43.7%), dizziness (34.6%), paraesthesia (20.6%), 
headache (17.7%), and muscular weakness (12.1%). 
Cognitive disorders AEs 
Cognitive disorders AEs (all grade) were reported in 25.9% of patients (see table below).

Note:  Entrectinib-  cognitive  impairment  AEGT  were  utilized  to  capture  potential  events  of  interest  of  cognitive  disorders  AE. 
Entrectinib- cognitive impairment AEGT include the PTs of altered state of consciousness, amnesia, amnestic disorder, cognitive 
disorder,  confusional  state,  delirium,  disorientation,  disturbance  in  attention,  hallucination,  hallucination  auditory,  hallucination 
visual, hallucinations mixed, impaired reasoning, incoherent, judgement impaired, memory impairment, mental disorder, mental 
impairment, mental status changes.  
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), AEs were reported in 24.2% of patients; 
these included events reported as cognitive disorders (6.3%), confusional state (7.3%), disturbance in 
attention (3.8%), memory impairment (4.2%), amnesia (2.8%), mental status changes (1.2%), 
hallucination (1.0%), delirium (0.8%), visual hallucination (0.4%) and mental disorder (0.2%). 
Grade 3 cognitve disorders were reported in 4.4% of patients. Adult patients who had CNS disease at 
baseline had a higher frequency of these adverse reactions (29.7%) compared to those without CNS 
disease (23.1%). The median time to onset for cognitive disorders was 0.92 months.

In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported 
in 15.7% of patients. The median time to onset was 0.49 months (range 0.03 months to 20.93 months) 
and the median duration was 0.8 months (range: 0.07 months to 6.01 months). The majority of patients 
(55.7%) recovered from peripheral neuropathy.

In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), syncope (by PT; all grade) was reported in 
4.6% of patients. All Grade 3 events (3.0%) had resolved by the time of the CCOD. Overall, the nature 
and severity of syncope events reported are consistent with those reported in the previous analyses. 
Seizure  
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), AEs of seizure (by PT) were reported in 
2.2% of patients, all Grade 1 or 2 including one 3 –year old paediatric patient. All patients 
experiencing seizures had either brain metastases or primary brain tumour at baseline 
Increased Creatinine and Other Renal Events  
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), increased creatinine and other renal 
events (Renal and urinary disorders [SOC], Renal function analyses [HLT]; all grade) were reported in 
40.5% of patients. Consistent to renal events analysed in previous reports, the most frequently 
reported event was blood creatinine increased (25.4%). Most blood creatinine increased events 
observed continue to be Grade 1 or 2. No new event of Grade 3 blood creatinine increased has been 
reported, and no clinically significant sequelae were reported in patients who experienced blood 
creatinine increased. There were no Grade 4 events reported. Acute kidney injury was reported in 
3.6% of patients, with most events being of Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 acute kidney injury was 
reported in 5 patients (1.0%) with 2 of these cases (0.6%) being serious. Each of the Grade 3 events 
of acute kidney injury resolved. 
Hematologic Toxicity 
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), hematologic AEs (Blood and Lymphatic 
system disorders [SOC], Hematologic investigations [HLGT]; all grades) were reported in 37.1% of 
patients. The most frequently reported hematologic toxicities were anemia (all grade: 28.2%, Grade 3: 
9.7%) and neutropenia AEs (PTs of neutrophil count decreased and neutropenia) (all grade: 11.3%, 
Grade 3 or 4: 4.4%). Anemia and neutropenia AEs (all grade and Grade 3 or 4) were reported more 
frequently in the paediatric population compared to the adult population. Based on laboratory data, the 
majority of patients who experienced post-baseline shifts in hematology parameters had shifts from 
baseline grade to Grade 1 or 2. Few patients had clinically relevant treatment-emergent worsening of 
laboratory parameters (defined as change from Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-
baseline) with the most common (≥2% of patients) being worsening to Grade 3 or 4 low lymphocytes 
levels (10.7%), followed by low hemoglobin (9.2%) and low neutrophils (6.3%). The laboratory value 
changes were transient and returned to baseline. 
Eye Disorders 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eye disorders reported across clinical trials included vision blurred (8.5%), diplopia (2.6%), and visual 
impairment (1.6%). The median time to onset for eye disorders was 1.9 months (range: 0.03 months 
to 21.59 months). The median duration of eye disorders was 1 month (range 0.03 months to 14.49 
months). The majority of patients (61.7%) recovered from the eye disorder adverse reactions. 
Elevated Liver Laboratory Tests and Other Liver Abnormalities 
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), abnormal liver function test and liver 
dysfunction AEs (Liver related investigations, signs and symptoms [SMQ], Hepatobiliary disorders 
[SOC]; all grade) were reported in 22.6% of patients, similar to the frequency reported previously. 
Consistently, the most frequently reported events were laboratory abnormalities including AST 
increased (17.5%) and ALT increased (16.1%). The majority of liver abnormality events were Grade 1 
and Grade 2 which resolved with no intervention. Overall, a larger proportion of paediatric patients 
experienced elevated transaminases compared to adult patients. No AE of “drug induced liver injury” 
was reported in any patient treated with entrectinib. As previously reported, five patients fulfilled the 
laboratory criteria of elevated ALT or AST (≥3 x ULN) in combination with elevated total bilirubin (≥2 x 
ULN). No additional patient in the expanded safety population satisfied these specific criteria. In each 
case, the observed liver abnormalities were indicative of baseline liver metastases or other causes and 
not drug induced liver injury. 
Changes in Weight  
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), AE of weight increased (by PT) was 
reported in 26.4% of patients, similar to the frequency reported previously; the majority of which were 
assessed as related to entrectinib (20.6% of patients). Consistent with the findings noted previously, 
the majority of patients who had weight increase reported had Grade 1 or Grade 2 events. Grade 3 
weight increased was reported in 7.9% of patients. Weight increase was reported as an adverse event 
in a higher proportion of pediatric patients than adult patients (all grade: 44.8% vs 25.3%, 
respectively; Grade 3: 13.8% vs. 6.9%). Most patients (21 of 25 patients) with Grade 3 weight 
increased were able to continue entrectinib with no dose adjustments. No AEs indicative of metabolic 
syndrome was concurrently reported in patients with weight increase. Adverse events of weight 
decreased (by PT) was reported in 2.6% of patients, mostly Grade 1 or 2. 
Based on available data from patients in the overall expanded integrated safety population with non-
missing baseline and at least one post-baseline weight measurement, 70.8% (342/483) of patients 
experienced Grade 1 or greater (≥5%) increase in body weight. Grade 3 (≥20% increase) post-
baseline weight increase was measured in 19.9% (96/483) of patients. A higher proportion of pediatric 
patients experienced Grade 3 weight increases (41.4%) compared to adult patients (18.5%). A few 
patients (8.7%; 42/483) experienced Grade 1 or greater weight decrease.  
Based on available BMI data, 184 patients in the expanded overall safety population experienced post-
baseline shifts to a higher BMI category. Of a total of 243 patients who were of normal BMI at baseline, 
101 patients shifted to overweight or obese categories post-baseline (n=95 and n=6, respectively). Of 
55 patients who were underweight (≤18.5 kg/m2) at baseline, 27 patients shifted to normal or 
overweight categories (n=25 and n=2, respectively) post-baseline. 
Congestive Heart Failure 
Congestive heart failure events were reported in 3.4% of patients.  An overview of congestive heart 
failure AEs by PT is provided in the table below.

failure 
a  The nature and clinical course of the Grade 5 cardiogenic shock fatal event was not consistent with congestive heart 
failure and was therefore excluded from the incidence of congestive heart failure AEs.  The event of cardiogenic shock is 
included in table 18 for the purpose of transparency.  
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), congestive heart failure events (PTs under 
Cardiac failure [SMQ]-narrow) were reported in 3.2% of patients. Consistent with the previous 
analyses, most patients with congestive heart failure events experienced Grade 3 (2.0% of patients) 
events. Serious events were reported in 9 (1.8%) patients, and compared to the previous analyses, 
included one additional patient in the expanded safety evaluable population enrolled after 30 
November 2017 with a serious Grade 3 event of cardiac failure requiring hospitalization and dose 
interruption. The event resolved and the patient could continue entrectinib treatment. A Grade 4 event 
of serious pulmonary edema was reported in a pediatric patient with infantile fibrosarcoma. Entrectinib 
was withdrawn and the event resolved. The event was considered related to entrectinib. Other events 
noted in this patient included dyspnea, hypoxia, lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory 
tract, pneumonia, respiratory acidosis and respiratory failure. One Grade 5 cardiogenic shock was 
reported in a patient with NSCLC due to pericardial effusion and pericardial tamponade. The nature and 
clinical course of the Grade 5 cardiogenic shock fatal event was not consistent with congestive heart 
failure. No other Grade 5 congestive heart failure event has been reported. 
Pneumonitis  
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), pneumonitis events were experienced by 
2.0% of patients and included pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis (0.8% each), alveolitis (0.4%), 
and interstitial lung disease (0.2%). The large majority of events were Grade 1 and 2. Grade 3 
pneumonitis events, all serious, were reported in 4 patients in the expanded safety population, 
 
 
including an additional event of Grade 3 radiation pneumonitis in one patient and Grade 3 alveolitis in 
one other patient enrolled after 30 November 2017. 
QT Interval Prolongation 
Among the 504  patients who received entrectinib across clinical trials, 17 (4.0%) patients with at least 
one post-baseline ECG assessment experienced QTcF interval prolongation of >60 ms after starting 
entrectinib, and 12 (2.8%) patients had a QTcF interval of 500 ms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
Fractures 
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), fractures were reported in 6.2% (31/504) 
of patients in the expanded safety population and were more frequently observed in paediatric patients 
aged <18 years (20.7%) than adult patients (5.3%). In adult patients, some fractures occurred in the 
setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area, while in paediatric patients all fractures occurred 
in patients with minimal or no trauma. The incidence of all fractures by preferred term was <1%. In 
both adult and paediatric patients, most were hip or other lower extremity fractures. The most 
frequent fractures by preferred term (>0.5%, i.e., 3 or more patients) were humerus fracture and 
pathological fracture (4 patients each), ankle fracture, foot fracture and tibia fracture (3 patients 
each). Grade 3 fractures were reported in 2.4% (12/504) of patients, with pathological fracture and 
femoral neck fracture being the only Grade 3 events by preferred term reported in more than one 
patient. There were no fractures Grade ≥4. The median time to onset of the first fracture in patients 
who experienced fractures was 3.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.5 months). None of the fracture events 
led to discontinuation of entrectinib. In the majority of cases no action with study drug was taken for 
fractures; in other cases entrectinib was interrupted, and the patient continued to receive entrectinib. 
At the time of the CCOD, the majority of fractures had resolved.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
In  the  overall  integrated  safety  population,  137  (38.6%)  patients  experienced  at  least  one  SAE. 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 30 (8.5%) patients.  
 
 
Table 85: Serious adverse events related to study treatment (CCOD: 31 May 2018; Safety population)
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), In the overall integrated safety 
population, 201 (39.9%) patients experienced at least one SAE. Treatment- related SAEs were 
reported in 49 (9.7%) patients, with the most frequently reported being cognitive disorders (1.0%). 
The most frequently reported SAEs regardless of causality by SOC (≥ 5% of patients, any grade) were 
as follows:  
- respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders (11.9%), the most frequently reported (≥2% of 
patients) PTs including dyspnea (4.6%), pleural effusion (3.0%), and pulmonary embolism (2.0%). No 
new additional respiratory SAEs were reported in ≥ 2% of patients in the expanded safety population.  
- infections and infestations (11.1%), the most frequently reported PT being pneumonia (4.0%). Other 
respiratory infections included upper respiratory tract infection (0.6%), lung infection (1.4%), lower 
respiratory tract infection (0.4%). 
- nervous system disorders (8.5%), the most frequently reported PTs being cognitive disorder and 
syncope (1.4% each). Other SAEs from this SOC were seizure (0.8%), hydrocephalus and headache 
(0.6% each), ataxia, cerebrovascular accident and dizziness (0.4% each). 
 
 
 
Compared to the earlier safety analyses, the overall incidence of SAEs in pediatric patients in this 
updated analysis in the expanded integrated population is higher, and the magnitude in the difference 
in incidence of SAEs between adult and pediatric patients that was evident in the earlier analyses, was 
less marked (<18 years: 34.5% vs. ≥18 years old: 40.2%). 
Deaths 
Grade 5 AEs occurred in 20 (5.6%) patients; none of which were assessed by the investigator as 
related to entrectinib. All Grade 5 events occurred in the adult population. A summary of fatal AEs by 
PT is provided in Table below.

Ten of the 20 Grade 5 AEs were respiratory AEs, the majority of which (9 of 10) were reported in 
patients with lung cancers or lung metastasis in the context of disease progression or deterioration of 
underlying cancers. Overall, there were no patterns with respect to the type of Grade 5 AEs reported, 
and the majority of Grade 5 AEs were reported in the context of worsening of underlying disease or 
complications of the underlying malignancy.  No fatal AEs were reported in pediatric patients.  
There were a total of 123 (24.4%) deaths in the overall integrated safety population (see Table below). 
Table 87: Deaths by cause (CCOD: 31 October 2018; safety evaluable population) 
An aggregate review of all grade 5 AEs in both paediatric and adult patients reported in the Company 
Safety Database was performed with a data cut-off date of 1 March 2020. In total, there were 45 fatal 
events reported: 30 events from clinical studies, 14 events from non-interventional studies/programs, 
 
 
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                      
 
and 1 event from a spontaneous report. 43 fatal AEs were reported in adult patients and 2 fatal AEs 
were reported in paediatric patients treated with entrectinib (both from non-interventional 
studies/programs). 
Compared to the analysis in the safety update report dated November 2019 (Clinical cutoff date: 31 
October 2018, N= 504), five additional Grade 5 AEs occurred in adult patients in clinical trials, which 
included fatal events of hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, atrioventricular block, cerebrovascular accident, 
and death (1 event each). There have been no Grade 5 AEs reported in paediatric clinical trials. 
Consistently with the fatal events observed in the previous Safety Update Reports, there were no 
patterns with respect to the type of Grade 5 AEs reported seen, and the majority of Grade 5 AEs were 
reported in the context of worsening of underlying disease or complications of the underlying 
malignancy. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
The majority of patients who experienced post baseline shifts in hematology parameters had shifts to 
Grade 1 or 2. Few patients had clinically relevant shifts (defined as change from Grade 0, 1 or 2 at 
baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline) with the most common (n=35 patients) being Grade 3 low 
lymphocytes levels, followed by Grade 3 low hemoglobin (n=30 patients) and Grade 3 low neutrophils 
(n=21 patients).  The laboratory value changes were transient and returned to baseline. 
Clinically relevant hematology laboratory abnormalities that were reported as AEs (i.e., Grade 3 or 4 
hematology AEs) occurred in few patients in the overall safety population, with the most common (≥ 
2.0% of patients in the overall safety population) being Grade 3 anemia (10.7%), neutropenia (2.5%), 
and neutrophil count decreased (2.3%). 
Chemistry 
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), the majority of patients who experienced 
post-baseline shifts in chemistry parameters had shifts from baseline grade to Grade 1 or 2. Few 
patients had clinically relevant treatment-emergent worsening to Grade 3 or 4 laboratory parameters 
(defined as change from Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline) with the most 
common (≥2% of patients) being low phosphorus (5.9%), followed by low albumin (3.8%; all Grade 
3), high AST, high glucose and low sodium (3.3% each), high ALT and high creatinine (3.1% each) and 
low calcium and low potassium (2.1% each). The laboratory value changes were transient and 
returned to baseline. The proportion of patients with shifts (both all grade and Grade 3 or 4) in liver 
laboratory parameters (AST increased, ALT increased, and bilirubin increased), based on the expanded 
safety population in the current analyses, was consistent with the previous analyses. All grade shifts 
(worsening from baseline) in elevated uric acid (hyperuricemia) was reported in 194 (50.8%) patients 
and Grade 3 or 4 shifts in elevated uric acid was reported in 26 (6.8%) patients in the integrated 
safety population. Of the 26 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricemia, 9 patients were treated 
with urate-lowering medication allopurinol. The median time to event onset of increased blood uric acid 
of all grade was 0.95 months (range: 0.23-13.77 months). 
Liver Laboratory Evaluations 
The majority of patients who experienced post baseline shifts in liver laboratory parameters (AST 
increased, ALT increased, and bilirubin increased) had shifts to Grade 1 or 2. Few patients had clinically 
relevant shifts in (defined as change from Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline): 
Grade 3 ALT increased (9 patients) and Grade 3 AST increased (8 patients).  
 
 
Overall, the incidence of liver laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs was higher in the paediatric 
analysis set compared to the overall adult population, primarily driven by higher rate of AST increased 
and ALT increased.   
Five (1.4%) patients in the overall integrated safety population met the laboratory abnormalities of 
ALT or AST ( 3  ULN) in combination with an elevated total bilirubin (> 2  ULN). Upon medical 
review, baseline liver metastasis or other confounding factors (such as medical history of liver or 
disease progression with new liver lesions) have been reported in all 5 patients; as such none of the 
liver enzyme abnormalities observed was indicative of drug induced liver injury.  
Weight and Body Mass Index 
A trend of body weight increase has been observed in patients treated with entrectinib. This 
observation is likely an on-target effect of entrectinib, as TRKB appears to be associated with appetite 
control. Based on available data on body weight, 65.6% (233/355) of patients experienced weight 
increase of 5% in the overall integrated safety population. A total of 99 (27.9%) patients experienced 
Grade 2 (10% to 20% increase) post-baseline weight increase and 63 (17.7%) patients experienced 
Grade 3 (20%) post-baseline weight increase. Few patients experienced weight decrease to Grade 1 
post baseline (7.3%) and Grade 2 post baseline (1.7%). 
Based on available data on BMI, in the overall integrated safety population, a total of 54 patients with 
normal BMI at baseline had their BMI shifted to overweight or obese category post baseline (n=51 and 
n=3, respectively). One patient with baseline BMI 18 kg/m2 (underweight) experienced a BMI shift to 
overweight category post baseline. 
Electrocardiography 
In Study STARTRK-2, ECGs were performed in triplicate and assessed by a central reader for all US 
and Japan sites.  For all other sites, ECGs were performed locally and in single observation. 
Triplicate Observations 
Approximately half of the patients with triplicate ECG readings had a reading of QTcF interval at 
baseline. Of these patients, the majority (n=99) had normal QTcF interval at baseline  450 msec. No 
patient had a baseline QTcF interval 500 msec. After receiving treatment with entrectinib, the 
majority of patients (n=98) continued to have normal post-baseline QTcF interval  450 msec. One 
patient had QTcF interval 500 msec post-baseline and 4 patients had maximum QTcF increase from 
baseline  60 msec.  
Singular Observations 
Approximately half of the patients with singular ECG reading had a reading of QTcF interval at 
baseline. Of these patients, the majority (n=89) had normal QTcF interval at baseline  450 msec.  No 
patient had a baseline QTcF interval 500 msec. After receiving treatment with entrectinib, the 
majority of patients (n=81) continued to have normal QTcF interval post-baseline 450 msec. One 
patient had QTcF interval >480  500 msec and 3 patients had maximum QTcF increase from baseline 
60 msec. 
In Study STARTRK-2, 3 (1.5%) patients had AE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Two events were 
Grade 1 and 1 event was Grade 3 in severity. One event of electrocardiogram QT prolonged led to 
entrectinib dose reduction. The other 2 events did not lead to entrectinib dose interruption or 
reduction.  All 3 events were considered related to entrectinib by the investigator. 
The relationship between entrectinib plasma concentrations and ECG data was further assessed in a 
PK-QT sub-study on a subset of patients from Study STARTRK-2.  The results showed no evidence that 
 
 
entrectinib causes any clinically relevant QTcF prolongation, but indicated a shortening of the QT-
interval with increasing concentration of entrectinib. 
In Study STARTRK-1, 5 patients had QTcF interval 450 msec post-baseline and 1 patient each had 
QTcF interval 480 msec and 500 msec post-baseline, respectively. Four patients had QTcF increase 
from baseline 60 msec. In Study STARTRK-1, 2 (2.6%) patients had AE of electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged. These events resolved without entrectinib dose interruption or reduction. Both events were 
considered related to entrectinib by the investigator. 
In Study STARTRK-NG, the majority of patients (12 patients) had normal QTc values (450 msec) at 
baseline and throughout the study. Among the other 4 patients who had a baseline QTc values within 
the category of 450 to 480 msec, one patient had normal post-baseline QTc values; the remaining 3 
patients each had maximum post-baseline QTc values reported in the category of 450 to 480 msec, 
480 to 500, and 500 msec, respectively. Overall, the maximum QTc change from baseline reported 
in the majority of patients (13 patients) was 30 msec; 3 patients had a maximum QTc increase of 30 
and 60 msec from baseline. All these events had no clinical impact and resolved without treatment 
and no action was taken with entrectinib. Two (12.5%) patients had AE of QT prolonged and 1 (6.3%) 
patient had AE of electrocardiogram QT shortened. All of these events were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity. These ECG abnormalities reported in the study all occurred in patients with pre-existing 
abnormalities.  All these events resolved without treatment and no action was taken with entrectinib. 
In Study ALKA, ECG data were performed locally and only collected limited information on the CRFs.  
QTc evaluation was performed at baseline and during treatment in 46 patients.  There was no evidence 
of QC/QTc interval prolongation. No patient had a QTc value greater than 480 msec. Two patients had 
a QTc value 450 msec. In both cases, no AE of prolonged QTc interval was reported and treatment 
continued without intervention. One patient had QTc increase from baseline 60 msec. No AE of 
prolonged QTc interval was reported for this patient.   
For the integrated analysis, the majority (58.6%) patients had normal QTc values ( 450 msec) at 
baseline and throughout the study.  Six patients (1.7%) had QTc interval 500 msec post-baseline, 
and 10 patients had maximum QTc increase from baseline  60 msec. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The overall safety profile of entrectinib across all age groups is summarized in the table below. 
 
 
Table 88: Overview of Safety by Age (CCOD: 31 October 2018, safety evaluable patients) 
Thirty four (34) patients (6.7%) were 75 years or older. In patients 18 years of age, a lower 
frequency (11.8%) of SAEs was observed compared to those 18−64 years and  65 years (42.3% and 
33.3%, respectively). Additionally, there were no deaths or AEs leading to study drug withdrawal 
reported for patients 18 years of age. 
ECOG 
Overall, the safety profile of entrectinib in adults across all baseline ECOG status is summarized in the 
table below. 
Table 89: Overview of Safety by ECOG Performance at Baseline (CCOD: 31 October 2018, safety 
evaluable patients) 
Consistent with the impact of the overall underlying disease burden on a patient’s general 
performance, a higher proportion of patients experienced SAEs, Grade 3 AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and deaths with higher ECOG performance status at baseline. 
 
 
 
 
Central Nervous System Metastases  
The safety profile of entrectinib in patients with CNS metastases is summarized in Table below. 
Table 90: Overview of Neurological Toxicity AEs by CNS Metastases at Baseline (CCOD: 31 October 
2018, safety evaluable patients) 
Neurological Toxicity Safety Summary by CNS Metastases at Baseline, Safety-Evaluable Patients 
Protocols: GO40782, GO40783, GO40784, CO40778 
Enrollment cutoff: Nov 30 2017, CCOD: May 31 2018, DBL: Jul 31 2018 
Patients with CNS metastases at baseline did not have a higher rate of AEs than those without, however, 
a higher proportion of patients with CNS metastases experienced SAEs and Grade 3 AEs. 
Geographical Region 
Grade 3 above AE, AE leading to discontinuation, and AE leading to dose reduction were observed in 
lower frequencies in the Europe compared with Asia-Pacific and North America. The frequencies of all 
AE, SAE, and AE leading to death were observed similarly across all regions.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
(see section on clinical pharmacology) 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs that led to withdrawal, dose interruption and/or dose reduction 
In the updated safety population (CCOD: 31 October 2018), a small proportion of patients (46/504 
[9.1%]) had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation in the overall integrated safety population. AEs 
leading to withdrawal were most frequently reported (≥ 1% of patients) in SOCs of respiratory thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders (2.2%), cardiac disorders (1.8%), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (1.6%), and nervous system disorders (1.2%). There was no predominant AE PT that led to 
withdrawal of entrectinib. 
A total of 231 (45.8%) patients experienced at least one AE that led to a dose interruption of 
entrectinib. By PT, the most frequently reported AEs leading to entrectinib dose interruption (≥ 1% of 
patients) were blood creatinine increased (4.4%), fatigue (4.2%) dizziness (4.0%), anemia (3.4%), 
pneumonia (3.1%), diarrhea and anemia (2.8% each), pyrexia, and dyspnea (2.5% each), nausea 
(2.3% each), AST increased and ALT increased, diarrhea and pneumonia (2.4% each), cognitive 
 
 
 
 
disorder and nausea (2.2% each), pyrexia and dyspnea (2.0% each ), neutrophil count decreased and 
edema peripheral (1.8% each), urinary tract infection (1.6%), vomiting, pleural effusion and 
hypotension (1.4% each) ataxia and lipase increased (1.2% each). 
A total of 131 (26.0%) patients experienced at least one AE that led to a dose reduction. By PT, the 
most frequently reported AEs leading to entrectinib dose reduction (≥ 1% of patients) were dizziness 
(4.4%), fatigue (2.8%), blood creatinine increased (2.4%), gait disturbance (1.8%), weight increased 
(1.4%) and anemia (1.2%). 
Paediatric safety data (CCOD: 1 November 2019) 
The safety results provided herein are presented for an integrated paediatric safety population of 32 
patients aged <18 years enrolled up to 1 May 2019 in STARTRK-NG (30 patients) and STARTRK-2 (2 
patients), studies. The analyses were based on safety data collected up to a clinical cut-off date 
(CCOD) of 1 November 2019 (see Table below). 
Table 91: Paediatric analysis sets in reported analyses of the safety of entrectinib in paediatric patients 
Patient status on study 
As of the CCOD of 1 November 2019, 18 out of the 32 patients in the integrated paediatric safety 
population (56.3%) had discontinued from the study and 14 patients (43.8%) were still on study. The 
most common reason for study discontinuation was the death of the patient (66.7% [12/18]). Most of 
the patients who died had neuroblastomas for which the NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene alteration 
status was unknown. 
Patient status on treatment 
As of the CCOD, 26 patients (81.3%) had discontinued entrectinib treatment. The primary reason for 
discontinuation of entrectinib was disease progression (20 patients [76.9% of those who 
discontinued]). The patients continuing to receive entrectinib treatment were patients with identified 
relevant gene fusions who continue to derive benefit. 
 
 
 
 
Demographics 
The median age of patients enrolled in the integrated paediatric safety population was 7.0 years 
(range: 4 months-17 years). The majority of patients were in the age group of ≥2 to <12 years (23 
patients [71.9%]). Males and females were equally represented (16 patients each [50.0%]). Most 
patients were white (28 patients [87.5%]) and not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (25 patients [78.1%]). 
The majority (22 patients [68.8%]) had a Karnofsky/Lansky performance score of at least 90 at 
screening. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The most common tumour types diagnosed at study entry in the 32 patients in the integrated 
paediatric safety population were neuroblastomas (13 patients, with an additional 2 patients with 
ganglioneuroblastomas), followed by primary CNS tumours (glioblastomas [3], gliomas [2], anaplastic 
ganglioglioma [1], anaplastic astrocytoma [1], desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma [1], and 
glioneuronal tumour [1]), sarcomas (all inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours [3]), infantile 
fibrosarcoma (2). The other tumour types were NSCLC (not otherwise specified), salivary carcinoma 
(MASC), and melanoma (metastatic to lung), represented in single patients. Fifteen patients (48.4%) 
had Stage IV tumours at initial diagnosis, and 18 patients (56.3%) presented with metastatic disease 
at baseline, most commonly affecting bone and lung. Three patients, all with neuroblastomas, had 
brain metastases at baseline. Molecular testing identified 17 patients with tumours harbouring positive 
gene fusions (9 NTRK1/2/3, 5 ROS1 and 3 ALK genes) and 2 patients with point mutations. The 
remaining 15 patients had either no detected genetic alteration in NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or ALK genes or 
no available molecular test result. 
Safety data 
An overall summary of treatment-emergent AEs reported by category for all patients treated with 
entrectinib in the integrated paediatric safety evaluable population (n=32) is shown in Table below. 
Table 92: Overview of adverse events in paediatric safety population 
 
 
 
 
Extent of exposure to study treatment 
Table 93: Extent of exposure to entrectinib in paediatric safety population 
The median treatment duration was longer in patients with tumours harbouring NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 or 
ALK gene fusions (11.7 months) compared to patients with no detectable relevant gene fusion (1.8 
months), almost all being neuroblastoma patients who discontinued early from study treatment. This 
greater extent of exposure to entrectinib was reflective of a higher proportion of patients with gene 
fusions achieving durable objective responses and continuing to receive daily entrectinib treatment, as 
compared to patients with no detectable relevant gene fusion, (predominantly neuroblastoma patients) 
who discontinued treatment due to progressive disease.

Deaths 
A total of 13 patients (40.6%) have died; the primary cause of death in every case was reported as 
progressive disease. There were no fatal AEs reported. Four of 13 patients died within 30 days of the 
last dose of entrectinib treatment. By tumour type, 9 of the 13 patients who died were neuroblastoma 
patients. The other four patients had salivary adenocarcinoma, anaplastic ganglioglioma, desmoplastic 
infantile astrocytoma and NSCLC-NOS . For the majority of patients who died, their NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, 
or ALK gene alteration status was unknown. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
A total of 50 SAEs were reported in 14 of the 32 treated patients (43.8%) (see Table below).

Three patients (3/32 [9.4%]) experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of entrectinib. Two events 
were previously reported in the previous Safety Update Report, dated November 2019: one non-
serious Grade 3 dyspnoea and one serious Grade 4 pulmonary oedema. At the time of the current 
report, one additional patient withdrew from entrectinib due to serious Grade 4 pancreatitis. This 
pancreatitis event was considered related to entrectinib by the investigator and had not resolved. 
There was no general trend in the reporting of specific AEs leading to withdrawal. 
Adverse events that led to entrectinib dose modification 
A total of 16 AEs led to dose reduction of entrectinib in 11 patients (34.4%). By preferred term, weight 
increased (4 patients) and blood creatinine increased (2 patients) were the only AEs which led to dose 
reduction in more than one patient. In 13 of the 16 cases where entrectinib dose was reduced for an 
AE the event resolved. 
A total of 133 AEs leading to dose interruption of entrectinib in 15 patients (46.9%). By preferred term 
neutrophil count decreased, diarrhoea and pyrexia were the only AEs which led to dose interruption is 
more than two patients (and three patients only). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Selected AEs defined by the Sponsor were defined on the basis of previous clinical experience, 
mechanism of action and safety profile from drugs with similar targets to provide a more 
comprehensive understanding of the paediatric safety profile of entrectinib. The same grouped terms 
that have been used for previous analyses were used in the current analysis of selected AEs.  
Neurologic toxicity was observed in 87.5% (28/32, Grade ≥3 15.7%) of patients: the most common 
(i.e. ≥10%) AEs by preferred term (PT) were headache (31.3%, Grade ≥3 6.3%), dysgeusia (21.9%, 
none Grade ≥3), muscular weakness (18.8%, Grade ≥3 3.1%), photophobia (18.8%, none Grade ≥3), 
anxiety, insomnia, somnolence and urinary incontinence (15.6% each, none Grade ≥3), agitation, 
dizziness, enuresis, gait disturbance and irritability (12.5% each, Grade ≥3 gait disturbance AEs 
6.3%). 
Ataxia AEs were observed in 5/32 patients (15.6%, Grade ≥3 6.3%), peripheral sensory neuropathy 
AEs in 4/32 (12.5%, none Grade ≥3), cognitive disorders AEs in 3/32 (9.4%, Grade ≥3 3.1%), 
 
 
 
dysesthesia AEs in 3/32 (9.4%, none Grade ≥3), syncope AEs in 3/32 (9.4%, Grade ≥3 6.3%), seizure 
AEs in 2/32 (6.3%, none Grade ≥3), 
Elevated liver laboratory tests and other liver abnormalities were reported in 23 out of 32 patients 
(71.9%, Grade ≥3 9.4%), the most common (i.e. ≥10%) AEs by PT being ALT increased (50%, Grade 
≥3 6.2%), AST increased (50%, Grade ≥3 6.2%) and hypoalbuminaemia (18.8%, Grade ≥3 3.1%). 
The majority of patients for whom elevated liver laboratory tests and other liver abnormalities AEs 
were reported, had Grade 1 events (46.9%) which resolved. 
Haematologic AEs were observe in 68.8% (22/32, Grade ≥3 43.8%) of patients: the most common 
(i.e. ≥10%) AEs by PT were anaemia (59.4%, Grade ≥3 12.5%), neutrophil count decreased (40.6%, 
Grade ≥3 25%), white blood cell count decreased (34.4%, Grade ≥3 9.4%), platelet count decreased 
(21.9%, Grade ≥3 9.4%) and lymphocyte count decreased (18.8%, Grade ≥3 12.5%). 
Increased creatinine and other renal AEs were reported in 22/32 patients (68.8%, Grade ≥3 3.1%) the 
most common (i.e. ≥10%) by PT being blood creatinine increased (43.8%, none Grade ≥3), 
haematuria (18.8%, none Grade ≥3), urinary tract infection (18.8%, Grade ≥3 3.1%), pollakiuria 
(15.6%, none Grade ≥3), proteinuria (15.6%, none Grade ≥3), urinary incontinence (15.6%, none 
Grade ≥3) and enuresis (12.5%, Grade ≥3 12.5%). 
Changes in weight AEs were observed in 17/32 patients (53.1%, Grade ≥3 25%), and the most 
common (i.e. ≥10%) AE by PT was weight increased (50.0%). The majority (13/32 patients [40.6%]) 
of weight increased events were assessed as related to entrectinib. Grade 1 or Grade 2 weight 
increased were reported in 9/32 patients (28.2%). Grade 3 weight increased was reported in 7/32 
patients (21.9%). Four of 7 patients with Grade 3 weight increased were able to continue entrectinib 
without dose modifications. One Grade 3 AE of weight decreased (by PT) was reported. 
A change from baseline in BMI category was measured in 50.0% (16/32) of patients while receiving 
entrectinib treatment. Treatment-emergent shifts (increases) in body-mass index (BMI) category were 
observed for 13 patients who were underweight at baseline (to normal, overweight and obese 
categories), 2 patients who were of normal weight at baseline (to overweight or obese categories) and 
1 patient who was overweight at baseline (to obese category). 
Eye disorders AEs were reported in 15/32 patients (46.9%, Grade ≥3 3.1%), the most common (i.e. 
≥10%) by PT being photophobia(18.8%, none Grade ≥3) and eye pain (12.5%, none Grade ≥3).  
Qt interval prolongation AEs in 2/32 (6.3%, none Grade ≥3). All patients met the eligibility criteria of 
having electrocardiogram corrected QT intervals (QTc; determined using Fridericia’s or Bazett’s 
formula) of ≤480 msec. The majority (24/32 [92.3%]) of patients had normal QTc values (≤450 msec) 
at baseline and of these, all except two patients (with maximum post-baseline QTc intervals of >450 
and ≤480 msec and >480 and ≤500 msec, respectively), maintained normal QTc intervals throughout 
the study. For the majority (23/32 [74.2%]) of patients, the maximum QTc interval increase from 
baseline was ≤30 msec; six patients had a maximum QTc increase of between 30 and 60 msec and 
two patients had an increase exceeding 60 msec. 
Congestive heart failure AEs in 1/32 (3.1%, Grade ≥3 3.1%) and pneumonitis AEs 1/32 (3.1%, Grade 
≥3 3.1%). 
Fractures: In paediatric patients all fractures occurred in patients with minimal or no trauma. A total of 
11 adverse reactions of fractures were reported in the 7 paediatric patients. The median time to 
fracture was 4.3 months (range: 2.46 months to 7.39 months) in paediatric patients. Rozlytrek was 
interrupted in 42.9% (3/7) of paediatric patients that experienced fractures. Three of the fractures 
were Grade 2 and 4 fractures were Grade 3. Three of the Grade 3 fractures were serious. There were 
no reports of tumour involvement at the site of the fracture. All but one event of fracture recovered. At 
 
 
the time of the CCOD, the outcome of the majority of the fractures (in 6/7 patients [85.7%]) had 
resolved (see Table below). 
Table 96: Listing of fractures in integrated paediatric safety population (CCOD; 1 November 2019) 
Post marketing experience 
Data were retrieved for all spontaneous cases reported between the date of the first marketing 
authorization (Japan, 18 June 2019) and 7 October 2019. 
Data for 8 patients, reporting 34 events were retrieved. The review of the reported events identified 
that in 7/8 cases, the onset of the events was before the first marketing authorization of entrectinib, 
which indicates, that these events, while being reported via spontaneous sources, represent events 
occurring in the clinical trials or compassionate use programs with entrectinib. One case reported 
events of peripheral edema, with onset date in October 2019, which represents the only report from 
the post marketing settings. All events were reported once and 22/34 of the reported events were 
serious.

and recovering / resolving for 1/34 events. Events, which were reported as not recovered / not 
resolved were Infection and Neoplasm recurrence. No events with fatal outcome were reported. 
The reported events were in line with the known safety profile of entrectinib or could be expected in 
the patient population with advanced malignancies. 
The Applicant additionally retrieved data reported to the safety database from non interventional 
program/studies (NIP/NIS), retrieved for all NIP/NIS cases as of 8 October 2019. 
 Data for 13 patients, reporting 72 events were retrieved. The majority of the events were reported 
once with exception of dizziness (reported in 4 patients), malaise (reported in 3 patients), constipation 
(3 patients) and anemia, dysphagia, nausea, fatigue, gait disturbance, pain, AST increased, blood 
creatinine increased and weight increased (each reported in 2 patients). Nineteen out of 72 of the 
reported events were serious. The summary of the reported events is presented in Table below.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The integrated safety database supporting the MAA of entrectinib in the broad claimed indication is 
comprised of 355 subjects who received at least one dose of entrectinib across 3 Phase I dose 
escalation/expansion studies (the ALKA and STARTRK-1 trials in adults and the STARTRK-NG study in 
children, adolescents and young adults) and one Phase II trial in adults (study STARTRK-2). All 
subjects in the integrated safety database were required to have at least 6 months of follow-up at the 
time of the data cut-off date (31 May 2018). 
An updated safety report submitted during the procedure comprises cumulative data from 504 
subjects, including 475 adult and 29 paediatric patients, irrespective of length of exposure and date of 
enrolment (data cut-off date October 31, 2018) provided only limited additional information to the 
already known safety profile of entrectinib.  
Four distinct safety analysis subsets were identified by the Applicant based on type of 
genetic/molecular alteration (subjects with NTRK gene fusion positive malignancies [n=113], patients 
with ROS1 positive NSCLC [n=210], subjects outside the claimed indication i.e. with ROS1 positive 
non-NSCLC, ALK fusion positive solid tumours or with no gene fusion [n=152]) and age (paediatric 
subjects with or without TRK, ROS1, or ALK gene fusions/molecular alterations n=29).  
Supportive safety data were also separately provided for 8 patients treated under a single-case 
compassionate use program and 14 adult patients from the PK Study RXDX-101-14. Data from all 
spontaneous cases (n=8) reported between the date of the first marketing authorization (Japan, 18 
June 2019) and 7 October 2019, and from non interventional program/studies (NIP/NIS, n=13) as of 8 
October 2019 were also submitted, together with safety data from healthy subjects exposed in clinical 
pharmacology studies.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the size of the entrectinib safety database in the claimed indication in adults (i.e. patients with 
NTRK gene fusion malignancies or ROS1 positive NSCLC) is considered of limited extent, yet in 
principle adequate due to the rarity of these genetic/molecular subtypes. 
As a general concern, the uncontrolled design of all the studies included in the pooled analysis is not 
considered adequate to clearly disentangle signs/symptoms of the underlying malignancies and 
entrectinib-related adverse events (AEs), in this regard, limited help is provided by the short-term 
safety data available in healthy subjects who were exposed to a variety of entrectinib doses. The 
integrated safety population is also characterised by a significant heterogeneity in terms of age (min 4, 
max 86 years), type of underlying malignancy, dose administered (from 100 to 1600 mg/m2/day, BSA-
based vs. flat dose), drug regimen (4 days on/3 days off for 21 days in 28-day cycles vs. continuous 
daily dosing) and formulation that further complicates safety evaluations.  
Median exposure to entrectinib was limited (5.5 months - 7 cycles), yet some patients were able to 
receive entrectinib up to 42 months. Treatment compliance is considered acceptable, with a median 
dose intensity as high as 96.5% and a low median number of missed doses (n=1). Median treatment 
duration was longer in subjects with NTRK gene fusions and ROS1 positive NSCLC (6.4 and 7.4 
months, respectively). 
Almost all subjects (99%) in the integrated safety population experienced at least 1 treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE), with the majority being considered as related (90.9%). Grade ≥3 AEs and 
serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced by 61.1% and 39.9% of patients, respectively, with only a 
minority of severe AEs/SAEs considered as treatment-related by the Investigator (32.1% and 9.7%, 
respectively). The incidence of AEs was generally consistent across all safety subsets, with the 
exception of a higher frequency of SAEs, Grade ≥3 AEs and AEs leading to death in the NTRK-adult 
subset. The clinical relevance of these findings has to be interpreted with caution, since differences 
across safety subsets in terms of exposure, dose, administration regimen, formulation, underlying 
malignancy, genetics and sample size might have impacted the data.  
In the safety population, 9.1% (46/504) of patients experienced an AE that led to entrectinib 
discontinuation and cardiac and respiratory AEs represented the primary reason for discontinuation. 
Overall, the proportion of patients with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation is relatively low, and 
no pattern or cluster of AEs leading to discontinuation could be identified. Dose Interruptions and 
reduction were observed in 45.8% and 26% of patients, respectively, with no specific pattern of AEs 
identifiable.  
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia, oedema, 
dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea, dysaesthesia, dyspnoea, anaemia, increased weight, increased blood 
creatinine, pain, cognitive disorders, vomiting, cough, and pyrexia. The most frequent serious adverse 
reactions (≥ 2%) were lung infection (5.2%), dyspnoea (4.6%), cognitive impairment (3.8%), and 
pleural effusion (2.4%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4.4% of 
patients.  
Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or 4 severity occurring more frequently (at least a 5% increased 
incidence) in paediatric patients compared to adult patients were neutropenia (20.7% vs. 3.4%), 
weight increased (13.8% vs 6.9%), headache (6.9% vs 0.6%) and bone fractures (10.3% vs 1.9%) 
(see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Overall, 123 subjects (24.4%) in the integrated safety population had died and in most cases (~70%) 
the reported reason for death was disease progression. Overall, at the time of the most updated 
analysis, 45 Grade 5 events reported: 30 fatal events from clinical studies, 14 from non-interventional 
studies/programs, and 1 from a spontaneous report. In particular, in the updated reports (last data 
cut-off date March 1, 2020), 8 additional grade 5 AEs were reported from clinical studies, which include 
 
 
pulmonary embolism(2 events), and cardiac arrest, sudden death, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, 
atrioventricular block, cerebrovascular accident, and death (1 event each). Among the 21 cases of fatal 
AEs initially reported, cardiac SOC AEs included 2 cases of cardio-respiratory arrest in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, and 1 case of cardiogenic 
shock due to pericardial effusion and pericardial tamponade in a patient with metastatic NSCLC. 
Overall, fatal AEs were reported in the context of advanced cancer or disease progression; no cluster 
or pattern with respect to the type of Grade 5 AEs is observed.  
AEs of special interest 
Neurologic AEs 
In accordance with the entrectinib mechanism of action and widespread expression of TRK receptors in 
nervous tissues, neurologic toxicity was heterogeneous and involved both central and peripheral 
nervous systems. Except for seizures, all events were considered as related to entrectinib and are 
included in the SmPC. Reassuringly, most AEs were mild to moderate (Grade 1/2 70.8%) and did not 
result in high drug discontinuation rates. Impairment of neurodevelopment in paediatric patients is 
included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
Cognitive disorders, including confusion, mental status changes, memory impairment, and 
hallucinations, were reported in clinical trials with Rozlytrek. Patients over the age of 65 years 
experienced a higher incidence of these events than younger patients. Patients should be monitored 
for signs of cognitive changes. Based on the severity of cognitive disorders, Rozlytrek treatment should 
be modified as described in section 4.2.of the SmPC. Patients should be counselled on the potential for 
cognitive changes with Rozlytrek treatment. Patients should be instructed not to drive or use machines 
until symptoms resolve if they experience cognitive disorders (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
Overall, ~16% of patients experienced at least one event of peripheral neuropathy (PN) during 
treatment, yet only a minority of patients had severe PN (5/504, 1%) and all events resolved with 
entrectinib dose reduction/interruption. 
Dysaesthesia was a common (29%) neurologic AE with entrectinib, and the actual impact of 
entrectinib on sensory perceptions was further highlighted by the high rates of dysgeusia (42%) 
observed in the safety population. Nearly all reported cases were mild to moderate in severity and 
were generally manageable without entrectinib interruption/dose reduction. 
The incidence of ataxia was approximately 16% (Grade ≥3 0.8%). All AEs resolved following 
entrectinib interruption/dose reduction, yet approximately 1/3 of subjects who experienced a fall/near 
fall AE had also reported a concurrent ataxia-related AE: this is considered or relevance, in particular 
for subjects at higher risk of fall (e.g. the elderly). The impact of CNS metastasis status on ataxia was 
investigated, yet in the original safety report only a slight increase in the rate of ataxia-related AEs 
was observed in subjects with brain metastasis (20.9% vs. 17.1%), further supporting the role of 
entrectinib in the genesis of ataxia-related AEs. 
Approximately 5% of subjects in the safety population had at least one syncope event (Grade ≥3 
3%). Alternative causes for syncope were identified, however, in a significant portion of the subjects 
who experienced a syncope event, and in the absence of proper controls the real incidence of 
entrectinib-related syncope remains uncertain.  
Seizure AEs were uncommon during treatment with entrectinib (2.2%, all Grade 1 or 2) and the vast 
majority of subjects with at least one episode of seizure had CNS metastases or primary brain tumours 
at baseline. The actual role of entrectinib as a possible “facilitating factor” for seizures in subjects with 
brain involvement is hardly establishable in the absence of direct controls; nonetheless, from a 
 
 
conservative perspective, seizure should be included in the adverse drug reactions profile of 
entrectinib. Cardiovascular toxicity 
Congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported across clinical trials with entrectinib. These reactions 
were observed in patients with or without a history of cardiac disease and resolved upon treatment 
with diuretics and/or entrectinib dose reduction/interruption. No potential mechanism for entrectinib to 
elucidate/contribute to congestive heart failure has been identified yet. For patients with symptoms or 
known risk factors of CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be assessed prior to initiation 
of entrectinib treatment. Patients receiving entrectinib should be carefully monitored and those with 
clinical signs and symptoms of CHF, including shortness of breath or oedema, should be evaluated and 
treated as clinically appropriate. Congestive heart failure is addressed in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
QTc interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with entrectinib in clinical trials. Use of 
Rozlytrek should be avoided in patients with a baseline QTc interval longer than 450  ms, in patients 
with congenital long QTc syndrome, and in patients taking medicinal products that are known to 
prolong the QTc interval. In addition, entrectinib should be avoided in patients with electrolyte 
imbalances or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart 
failure, unstable angina, and bradyarrhythmias . If in the opinion of the treating physician, the 
potential benefits of entrectinib in a patient with any of these conditions outweigh the potential risks, 
additional monitoring should be performed and a specialist consultation should be considered. 
Assessment of ECG and electrolytes at baseline and after 1 month of treatment with entrectinib are 
recommended. Periodic monitoring of ECGs and electrolytes as clinically indicated throughout 
entrectinib treatment, are also recommended. Based on the severity of QTc prolongation, entrectinib 
treatment should be modified (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Lung toxicity 
Pneumonitis (also including interstitial lung disease, alveolitis and radiation pneumonitis) was 
observed in 2.% of patients were reported in the entrectinib safety population. Further pleural 
effusion AEs were also not uncommon (8.2%, grade ≥3 3.1% in the original safetyreport) and were 
observed in all safety subsets with the exception of the paediatric subgroup. The evaluation of actual 
role of entrectinib exposure in promoting pleural effusion is uncertain, since causality assessment is 
complicated by lack of direct controls and presence of confounders (e.g. lung metastasis), yet cannot 
be excluded, considering that a similar rate of pleural effusion AEs has been observed in all patients, 
irrespective of cancer type. Further, fluid retention-related AEs are reported as “very common” with 
entrectinib. From a conservative perspective the role of entrectinib in the onset of pleural effusion 
cannot be definitively ruled out. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity  
GI toxicity was not negligible, with a significant fraction of subjects in the initial safety report 
experiencing constipation (45.9%), diarrhoea (34.6%), nausea (34.4%) and vomiting (24.2%). Severe 
(Grade ≥3) GI AEs were observed, however, only in a minority of subjects (5.4%), the most common 
being diarrhoea (2%), abdominal pain and constipation (0.6% each).  
Myelotoxicity  
Non-cytotoxic myelotoxicity is a known toxicity of most TKIs, and entrectinib is no exception. Most 
changes in hematologic parameters were of limited clinical relevance (i.e. shifts from baseline to Grade 
1 or 2); hematologic toxicity was transitory in nature and overall manageable with standard supportive 
procedures.  
Eye disorder 
 
 
Eye disorder events were reported in 26% of patients. Vision blurred (including the PTs of diplopia, 
vision blurred and visual impairment) has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Bone fractures 
Fractures were experienced by 5.3% (25/475) of adult patients. In general, there was inadequate 
assessment for tumour involvement at the site of fracture; however, radiologic abnormalities possibly 
indicative of tumour involvement were reported in some adult patients. Most fractures were hip or 
other lower extremity fractures (e.g., femoral or tibial shaft). No patients discontinued entrectinib due 
to fractures. 
In adult patients, some fractures occurred in the setting of a fall or other trauma to the affected area. 
The median time to fracture was 3.4 months (range: 0.26 months to 18.5 months) in adults. 
Entrectinib was interrupted in 36.0% of adults that experienced fractures. 
Laboratory and vital signs abnormalities 
A significant fraction of subjects in the entrectinib safety database (~40%) experienced at least one 
renal AE, the more frequent PT being blood creatinine increased (25.4%). Based on the available 
data, inhibition of Trk receptors can result in urinary retention, which might contribute to the high risk 
(13.8%) of urinary tract infection.  
Abnormal liver function tests were not uncommon in subjects treated with entrectinib (22.6%), 
with the majority of events characterised by an increase in transaminases (AST increased 17.5%, ALT 
increased 16.1%). Reassuringly, no AE of hepatic drug injury was reported yet. Overall, the available 
data do not suggest that direct disease involvement of the liver is the main driver of the observed 
hepatic toxicity, in particular with respect to transaminase increases. 
Abnormalities in vital signs were observed in subjects exposed to entrectinib, in particular 6 patients in 
study STARTRK-NG experienced a decrease in heart rate >20 beats per minute from baseline, 
15.8% of patients in the overall safety population had at least 1 AE of hypotension and 4.5% 
experienced hypertension. 
Hyperuricemia has been observed in patients treated with entrectinib. Serum uric acid levels should be 
assessed prior to initiating Rozlytrek and periodically during treatment. Patients should be monitored 
for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. Treatment with urate-lowering medications should be 
initiated as clinically indicated and Rozlytrek withheld for signs and symptoms of hyperuricemia. 
Rozlytrek dose should be modified based on severity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Changes in weight 
Weight increase due to deregulated food intake was considered a consequence of TRK inhibition by 
entrectinib. Overall, 70.8% of patients experienced a ≥5% weight increase during treatment, and 101 
subjects with a normal BMI at baseline were subsequently classified post-treatment as overweight or 
obese. Taking into account that most patients did not report a concurrent event of fluid retention, the 
pharmacodynamic effect of entrectinib through TrkB inhibition may provide a plausible mechanism for 
weight increase. 
Safety in special populations 
The overall safety profile of entrectinib in the elderly patients is similar to the safety profile observed in 
patients younger than 65 years of age. Adverse reactions occurring more frequently in the elderly 
compared to patients less than 65 years old were dizziness (48.5% vs 36.6%), blood creatinine 
increased (31.5% vs 23.3%), and hypotension (21.5% vs 14.7%), ataxia (23.8% vs 12.8%). 
 
 
Incidence of AEs was generally similar in patients with and without CNS metastases at baseline, except 
for a higher frequency of serious AEs and grade ≥3 AEs in patients with baseline CNS metastasis. 
Cognitive disorder events were generally reported at a higher frequency in patients with baseline CNS 
metastasis compared to those without CNS metastasis at baseline. This is reflected in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
Female patients of childbearing potential should have medically supervised pregnancy testing prior to 
initiating entrectinib therapy. Entrectinib is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. Female patients receiving entrectinib should be advised 
of the potential harm to the foetus. Female patients should be advised to contact the doctor, should 
pregnancy occur. It is unknown whether entrectinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A 
risk to the breast-fed children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during 
treatment with Rozlytrek (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Entrectinib has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
instructed not to drive or use machines until the symptoms resolve, if they experience cognitive 
adverse reactions, syncope, blurred vision, or dizziness, during treatment with entrectinib (see sections 
4.4, 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Supportive safety data and post-marketing experience 
Information from the supportive safety data sources was limited, yet overall in line with data from the 
integrated safety database.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety of entrectinib in paediatric patients was established based on extrapolation of data from 
three open-label, single-arm clinical trials in adult patients with solid tumours harbouring an NTRK 
gene fusion (ALKA, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2), and data from 32 paediatric patients (30 patients 
enrolled in STARTRK-NG, and 2 patients enrolled in STARTRK-2). Of these, 2 patients were less than 
2 years old, 23 patients were 2 to 11 years old, 7 patients were 12 to 17 years old.  
The fraction of patients harbouring on-target gene fusions is 17/32, yet only 14 out of 17 (9 with NTRK 
1/2/3 gene fusions and 5 with genetic alterations involving ROS1) are representative of the claimed 
indication. 
The median exposure in the paediatric safety population is 5.6 months (11.7 months when only on-
target patients are considered), which allows for a more reliable characterisation of the entrectinib 
safety profile. On the other hand, nearly half of the patients included in the paediatric dataset (15/32, 
most with clinically advanced neuroblastoma) had no detectable relevant gene fusion (i.e. off-target 
population) and their contribution to the safety analysis is limited (median exposure 1.8 months). 
The rates of paediatric patients who experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (100%), SAE 
(43.8%) and severe AE (Grade ≥3 AE, 65.6%) are overall in line with what was observed in the adult 
population (SAE rate ~40% and Grade ≥3 AE rate ~60%) with a similar drug exposure [5.5 months]. 
No Grade 5 AEs have been reported in the enrolled paediatric population. 
The median dose intensity was high (96.3%), with rates of AEs leading to discontinuation, dose 
reduction or interruption (9.4%, 34.4% and 46.9%, respectively) also in line with those reported in the 
overall safety population (i.e. 9%, 26% and 46%, respectively). Weight increased (4 patients) and 
blood creatinine increased (2 patients), were the most common AEs which led to dose reduction and 
neutrophil count decreased (3 patients), diarrhoea (3 patients) and pyrexia (3 patients) to dose 
interruption, respectively. 
 
 
A full characterization of the safety profile of entrectinib in paediatric patients is problematic, mainly 
because of reduced sample size. The AEs reported in children/adolescents appear to be in line with the 
entrectinib safety profile observed in adults, although some differences can be noted. Compared to 
adult patients, paediatric patients were more likely to experience e.g. nausea (30.9% vs. 46.9%), 
pyrexia (18.3% vs.56.3%), weight increase (25.3% vs. 50%), pain in extremity (9.1% vs. 40.6%), 
cough (20.2% vs. 50%), decreased appetite (10.9% vs. 31.3%), anaemia (26.3% vs. 59.4%) and 
neutropenia (11.3% vs. 40.6%). Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or 4 
severity occurring more frequently (at least a 5% increased incidence) in paediatric patients compared 
to adult patients were neutropenia (28.1% vs. 3.4%), weight increased (21.9% vs 6.9%), headache 
(6.3% vs 0.6%) and bone fractures (12.5% vs 1.9%). 
Younger patients were also more prone than adults to haematological (68.8% vs. 37%, respectively), 
liver (71.9% vs. 22.6%), renal (68.8% vs. 40.5%) and ocular toxicity (46.9% vs. 26%), and more 
likely to experience bone fractures (21.9% vs. 5.3%). Bone fractures were reported in patients less 
than 12 years of age and were localised in the lower extremity (with a predilection for hip, femur and 
tibia). Bone fractures in paediatric patients generally occurred with minimal or no trauma. Three 
patients had more than one occurrence of a fracture and 3 patients had entrectinib treatment 
interrupted due to a fracture. All patients continued entrectinib treatment and all but one event of 
fracture recovered. In 2 paediatric patients, bilateral femoral neck fractures occurred. 
For the majority of patients, concurrent risk factors for development of fractures (e.g. steroid use, 
radiation, stem cell transplantation, low grade hypocalcaemia, reduced vitamin D levels and 
osteopenia) were also reported. Nonetheless, a direct role of entrectinib in the genesis of bone fracture 
cannot be excluded, due to the discussed potential impact of TRK/ROS1 inhibition in physiological bine 
remodelling processes. The STARTRK-NG study has been modified to collect blood markers of bone 
metabolism and reabsorption, and regularly scheduled DXA scans and hand and knee x-rays have been 
implemented to further investigate the role of entrectinib in bone fractures. Patients with signs or 
symptoms of fractures (e.g., pain, abnormal gait, changes in mobility, deformity) should be evaluated 
promptly (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
On the other hand, the incidence of cognitive AEs was still lower in paediatric patients compared to 
adults (9.4% vs. ~24%, respectively). 
Safety analyses stratified by paediatric age class were also provided to further characterize the 
tolerability of entrectinib in the target population, which includes patients aged ≥12 and <18 years: 
although some differences could be observed in the safety profile of children and adolescents (e.g. a 
higher incidence of diarrhoea [47.8% vs. 0], vomiting [43.5% vs. 0], white blood cell count decreased  
and decreased appetite [39.1% vs 14.3%], dehydration [30.4% vs 0], hypophosphatemia [30.4% vs 
0] hypalbuminaemia [26.1% vs 0], urinary tract infections [26.1% vs 0%], and pollakiuria, 
proteinuria, pruritus, somnolence, urinary incontinence [21.7% vs 0%, each]), poor numbers question 
the reliability of any possible inference. Interestingly, it is noted that no event of bone fracture was 
reported in patients aged ≥12 years: this is in line with previous data showing a lower risk for bone 
fractures in adults compared to children, yet due to the limited dataset no definitive conclusion can be 
drawn.  
Overall, the available safety data in the paediatric setting are limited, since only 32 subjects who 
received entrectinib were aged <18 years. Most importantly, only 14/32 paediatric patients had 
tumours with NTRK 1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions, and 7/32 were aged ≥12 and <18 years, as per the 
claimed indication. The longer median exposure (5.6 months, up to 11.7 months for “on-target” 
subjects) in the updated analysis allowed, however, for a better characterisation of entrectinib toxicity 
in younger patients. In this regard, despite some uncertainty due to poor numbers, lack of direct 
controls and clinical heterogeneity, the paediatric safety profile of entrectinib appears to be overall in 
 
 
line with that observed in adults. Some differences (e.g. a higher incidence of haematological, liver, 
renal and ocular toxicity, and a greater risk of bone fractures and weight increase) can, however, be 
noted. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
In order to further characterize the safety profile of entrectinib in patients aged ≥12 and <18 years, 
additional safety data should be provided post-approval. The Applicant will submit a safety report in all 
entrectinib-treated adolescent patients from STARTRK-NG (CO40778) and any other study with 
entrectinib where adolescent patients are enrolled post-approval, by the end of 2023. The report will 
include (but not limited to) assessment on growth and development and important risks such as , bone 
fractures, neurocognitive disorders, CHF and QT interval prolongation (see SOB). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety database in the claimed indications is of limited extent, yet acceptable in the 
context of such rare conditions. Based on available data, the safety profile of entrectinib is considered 
overall manageable. There are limited safety data in adolescents, however, the safety profile in 
adolescents is similar to the overall safety profile of Rozlytrek. Adverse reactions Grade ≥3 reported in 
adolescents were neutropenia and headache. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
The MAH should submit the results of an interim safety and efficacy analysis of the NTRK efficacy-
evaluable adult and paediatric patients including adolescents that are available as per integrated 
statistical analysis plan. (see SOB).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.06.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of entrectinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers entrectinib to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
 
 
 
 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rozlytrek (entrectinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a]. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
 
 
 
 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indications for entrectinib are:  
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of age 
and older, with solid tumours that have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion,  
- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in 
severe morbidity, and 
- who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor 
- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1-positive, 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors. 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
The ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) encodes an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase. ROS1 gene 
rearrangements from chromosomal translocations lead to constitutive activation of the ROS1 kinase 
that drives cellular transformation and promotes survival and proliferation through downstream 
signalling. ROS1 rearranged NSCLC has been described as a distinct molecular type in approximately 
1–2% of patients with NSCLC, usually non-overlapping with other main molecular alterations. 
Incidence of brain metastases ranges from 20-50%. FISH has been the standard approach to detecting 
ROS1 rearrangements. NGS is an emerging technology. Similarly to what observed for NSCLC ALK-
positive patients, ROS-1 positive NSCLC patients are typically young, female, non-smokers and with 
adenocarcinoma histology.  
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours  
NTRK gene fusions have been identified at low frequencies in a wide range of commonly occurring 
tumours, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, sarcoma and others. In 
very rare tumours, such as infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), secretory/juvenile breast cancer, and 
mammary analogue secretory cancer of the salivary glands (MASC), however, NTRK gene fusions are 
the defining genetic feature occurring in most or all cases.  
The purpose of treatment in this disease setting is to reduce symptoms of disease, and to prolong 
survival. It is not excluded that patients with locally advanced disease might become operable and 
potentially cured, however.  
The additional indication “or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity” concern 
patients who have a life-threatening malignant disease although presently in a potentially curable 
stage. They are presently surgically curable but at the cost of mutilating surgery affecting function of 
body parts. The prognostic significance of NTRK fusion and its influence on a tumour’s sensitivity to 
classical treatments is not known for the time being.  
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
Crizotinib is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1-positive 
advanced NSCLC. Crizotinib approval was based on 53 subjects included in the single arm trial 
PROFILE-1001. Recently published updated results of this study showed that, after a median FU of 
62.6 months, ORR was 72% (95%CI 58, 83; CR 11%), median DOR 24.7 months (95%CI 15.2, 45.3), 
median PFS 19.3 months (95%CI 15.2, 39.1), median OS 51.4 months (95% CI, 29.3, NR; 
probabilities of survival at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months of 91%, 79%, 67%, 53%, and 51%, 
respectively).  
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours 
A Conditional Marketing Authorisation was granted by the European Commission on 19/09/2019 to 
Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), an NTRK inhibitor, for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a NTRK gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or 
where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment 
options. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
The initially submitted data supporting the indication for Entrectinib in ROS1 positive NSCLC is 
represented by an integrated analysis including 53 adult patients with ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC. 
Subjects were pooled from the three single-arm clinical studies of entrectinib in adult. All patients 
included in the pooling received at least one dose of entrectinib, had measurable disease at baseline by 
investigator, had ECOG≤2 and did not receive prior ROS1 inhibitors. Patients in the ROS1 NSCLC 
analysis had at least 12 months of follow-up from the time of first response. Results of larger dataset 
including n=94 subjects (at least 12 months of follow up) and n=161 (at least 6 months of follow up) 
were provided. 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours  
The initially submitted data supporting the indication for Entrectinib in NTRK fusion positive solid 
tumours is represented by 54 adult patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours. Subjects were 
pooled from the three single-arm clinical studies of entrectinib in adult. All patients included in the 
pooling received at least one dose of entrectinib, had measurable disease at baseline by investigator, 
had ECOG≤2 and did not receive prior NTRK inhibitors. Patients in the NTRK analysis had at least 6 
months of follow-up. A larger dataset including n=74 subjects with >6 months of follow up was 
provided.   
Patients NTRK fusion positive solid tumours from the paediatric study STARTRK-NG, and patients 
within the compassionate use of entrectinib, have been presented separately as supportive for the 
NTRK indication in the paediatric age. 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
In 94 patients (at least 12 months of follow up) ORR was 73.4% (63.3, 82.0) (CR 11.7%) and mDOR 
was 16.5 months (14.6, 28.6). In the dataset including 161 patients (at least 6 months of follow up) 
ORR was 67.1% (95%CI 59.3;74.3) and median DoR is 15.7 months (95%CI 13.9;28.6). 
In 34 patients with CNS disease at baseline, IC-ORR was 50% (95%CI 32.4%, 67.6%), and median 
IC-DOR 12.9 months (95%CI 5.6, 22.1). Of those, in 22 patients receiving no brain RT or RT>2 
months before, IC-ORR was 36.4% (95%CI 17.2%, 59.3%). 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours 
In the NTRK evaluable analysis set (n=74), ORR by BICR per RECIST 1.1 (confirmed) was 63.5% 
(95%CI 51.5, 74.4), with 5 (6.8%) CRs (CR in 2 patients with breast secretory tumour, 2 with MASC 
and 1 with NSCLC). Median DOR was 12.9 (95%CI 9.3, NE). In rare tumours with high prevalence 
(>90%) of NTRK fusions, i.e. breast secretory cancer and salivary MASC, ORR was >90%. 
In patients with brain metastases confirmed by BICR (n=11), IC-ORR was 54.5% (95%CI 23.38, 
83.25). Median IC-DOR was not estimable. Among them, 8 subjects not previously irradiated or with 
brain RT >2 months had an IC-ORR of 62.5% (95%CI 24.5%, 91.5%).  
Of the 6 paediatric patients having NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours evaluated for efficacy, all 
achieved an objective response by BICR (2 CR and 3 PR plus 1 PR not yet confirmed at the CCOD). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
Data on intracranial activity are limited and uncontrolled. No data on intracranial activity of established 
therapies in ROS-1 are available. In view of the high prevalence of CNS metastasis in NSCLC cancer, a 
PAES will be conducted to provide further data in patients with baseline CNS disease (see Annex II). 
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours 
Due to the limited efficacy data base, the extent to which tissue of tumour origin or concomitant 
genetic alterations impact efficacy is in need of further clarification. 
Due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals are generally wide, making efficacy estimates 
generally imprecise and hampering the possibility to draw conclusions regarding efficacy in subgroups, 
e.g. with regard to age groups and gene fusion type. This aspect will be addressed by the post-
marketing study (see SOB and RMP). 
In light of the claimed site and histology independent indication, the non-clinical pharmacological data-
package is considered insufficient to extrapolate activity in all clinical TRK fusions and tumour 
histologies including paediatric tumours. 
Applicable to both indications  
Data were pooled and derived from single arm studies which render interpretation of time-to-event 
endpoints limited. 
The pooled analyses contained a mix of data intended as pivotal or not. A fundamental problem in 
basing decisions from data pooled over almost the whole study program is that the confirmatory 
element is obliterated. The risk of incorrectly concluding efficacy is much larger if these conclusions are 
based on analyses made in a single step rather than on a sequence of studies. 
 
 
Intracranial activity evaluated in a limited number of subjects. In IC responders who received RT within 
2 months, an effect of the recent RT to the CNS response cannot be excluded, making difficult to 
determine the real contribution of entrectinib to the observed IC-ORR. Therefore, the group “No brain 
RT or brain RT >2 months” is considered to better estimate the IC-response.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The provided safety database is comprised of 504 subjects who received at least one dose of 
entrectinib across four clinical studies. Four distinct safety analysis subsets were identified by the 
Applicant based on type of genetic/molecular alteration (NTRK fusion positive subjects n=113, ROS1 
positive patients with NSCLC n=210, subjects outside the claimed indication [i.e. with ROS1 positive 
non-NSCLC, ALK fusion positive solid tumours or with no gene fusion] n=152) and age (paediatric 
subjects n=32) (data cut-off date 31 October 2018 for the overall population and 1 November 2019 for 
paediatric subjects).  
The most frequently reported TEAE by SOC were “Nervous System Disorder” (82.5%), 
“Gastrointestinal” (81.5%), “General Disorders and Site Conditions” (73.4%), “Respiratory, Thoracic 
and Mediastinal Disorders” (~60%), “Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders” and 
“Investigations” (~55%) and “Infections and Infestations” SOCs.  
The most frequently reported (≥25% of patients) AEs by PT were fatigue (45%), constipation (43%), 
dysgeusia (42%), dizziness (36%), diarrhoea (34%), nausea (32%), anaemia (28%), peripheral 
oedema (27.8%), dyspnoea (27%), weight increased (26%) and blood creatinine increased (25%). 
The majority of the reported AEs were Grade ≤2. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs (≥ 2% of patients) 
were anaemia (9.7%), weight increased (7.3%), dyspnoea (5.4%), fatigue (4.8%), pneumonia 
(3.8%), AST increased (3.6%), ALT increased (3.4%), syncope (3.0%), pulmonary embolism, pleural 
effusion and neutrophil count decreased (2.8% each), urinary tract infection and diarrhoea (2.6% 
each), hypoxia (2.4%) and hypophosphatemia (2.2%).  
The most commonly reported SAEs by PT were pneumonia (3.9%), dyspnoea (3.7%), pleural effusion 
(3.4%), pulmonary embolism (2.3%) and pyrexia (2%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety database in the claimed indications is relatively limited, although acceptable in the 
context of the rare biomarker positive indications. In addition, the uncontrolled design of all the studies 
does not allow to clearly disentangle signs/symptoms of the underlying malignancy and entrectinib-
related adverse events.  
The integrated safety population is also characterised by a significant heterogeneity in terms of age 
(min 4 months, max 88 years), type of underlying malignancy, dose administered (from 100 to 1600 
mg/m2/day, BSA-based vs. flat dose), drug regimen (4 days on/3 days off for 21 days in 28-day 
cycles vs. continuous daily dosing) and formulation (F1, F2A and F2B). Such significant heterogeneity 
in an uncontrolled setting limiting precise evaluations of entrectinib safety profile and the reliability of 
causality relationships. 
The paediatric safety database is very limited (32 patients, 7 aged ≥12 and <18 years). This is further 
complicated by high rate of “off-target” patients (15/32), heterogeneity of the underlying tumours and 
different doses received. The significant limits in the paediatric safety dataset, especially in 
adolescents, do not allow a full characterisation of the safety profile of entrectinib in this setting. 
Additional data need to be collected post approval (see SOB).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
Entrectinib showed antitumor activity by inducing a relevant objective response rate in ROS1-inhibitor 
naïve ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC adult patients, of some durability, confirmed with longer follow-
up and in larger dataset. The magnitude of this effect is such that it is likely to result in clinically 
relevant effects on PFS, although uncertainties are still present due to lack of direct controls, whereby 
an impact of entrectinib treatment on PFS/OS cannot be directly ascertained. The achievement of 
intracranial responses also in patients who did not received prior brain RT, suggests activity of 
entrectinib in CNS metastases, although given the small number of patients, estimates should be 
interpreted with caution. However, intrinsic limitations of the data are related to the single arm design 
and pooling of patients across studies.  
The safety database in the claimed indication is considered limited, yet acceptable. Based on available 
data, the toxicity profile of entrectinib in adult patients is considered manageable.  
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours 
Entrectinib showed antitumor activity by inducing objective responses in adult patients with NTRK 
fusion positive solid tumours. Although there is uncertainty about the precise magnitude of effect, both 
due to the study conduct and since the understanding of the extent that tissue of origin is an effect 
modifier is incomplete; the observed overall ORR of 63.5% is considered outstanding. 
Responses appear durable, with median >12 months. However, due to limited number of patients in 
some tumour types, there is uncertainties regarding DOR estimate per tumour type. Overall, the 
activity in tumours where NTRK-fusions are present, is such that clinically relevant effects may be 
anticipated, and entrectinib is thus a reasonable treatment option in patients for whom non-NTRK 
targeted therapeutic options are either not available or have been exhausted.  
The impact of tissue of origin and concomitant genetic alterations are not fully understood and will be 
addressed in the context of the specific obligations (see below). 
The safety database in the claimed indication is still considered limited, but acceptable in the context of 
a rare condition. Based on available data, the safety profile of entrectinib in adult patients is 
considered manageable.  
Paediatric setting:  
An indication in adolescents is considered possible based on allometric scaling (with fixed allometric 
exponents 0.75 and 1) and leaving the possibility to justify if the difference in bioavailability is not 
observed in adolescent compared to adults. The model has been updated including only adolescents 
taking F1 and F2 formulations and testing the covariate F1 on Frel in adolescent population; the 
relative BA in adolescents is 24% lower than adults and it is not so far different from that observed in 
the original popPk model including the overall paediatric population (28%). The only aspect that at 
present can overcome the lower BA observed for F1 formulation in paediatric patients is the presence 
of the acidulant in F06 formulation that resolved the sensitivity of entrectinib to gastric environment 
and dosing conditions. This can suggest that the F06 formulation can lead to a similar BA in 
adolescents and in adults. 
The simulations of the exposure (AUCss) of entrectinib and its metabolite, M5 provided by the 
Applicant showed that, also for lower categories of weight (from 30 kg) included within the BSA 1.1-
 
 
1.5 m2, the exposure in subjects aged ≥12 years is within those obtained in adults. The applicant 
claimed that the proposed posology of 300 mg/m2, i.e. 400 mg in the BSA group ≥1.1 to <1.5 m2, is 
safer as the risk for over-exposure is lower compared to the FDA approved posology of 500 mg to this 
BSA group. The Applicant proposed to maintain the 400 mg dose for category IV for a more 
conservative approach and to minimise the risk of over-exposure, and it is agreed. 
The low number of adolescents in the age group 12-18 years with tumours harbouring NTRK 1/2/3 
gene fusions is acknowledged. Indeed, since the start of the expansion portion of STARTRK-NG in Dec 
2017 and up to now, out of the 14 paediatric patients recruited with a NTRK gene fusion there was 
only one patient ≥12 years of age. It is also noted that, out of 28 paediatric patients treated with the 
approved NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib, 3 only were aged 12-18 years (EPAR Vitrakvi). Based on the 
current recruitment benchmark, the number of patients ≥12 years that the Applicant expect to enroll 
within in the SOB1 may not be higher than 3 - 5 patients (target date 31 March 2027). 
In conclusion, the CHMP is of the opinion that an indication for entrectinib for solid tumours that have a 
NTRK gene fusion, - who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical 
resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and - who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor - 
who have no satisfactory treatment options, can be granted in adolescents (≥ 12 years). The dose 
recommendation in children is based on data from popPK analysis which is considered acceptable 
based on the simulation provided.  The activity of entrectinib in adolescents is considered established 
based on extrapolation of data obtained in adult patients with NTRK fusion positive solid tumours.  
A full characterisation of the safety profile of entrectinib in paediatric patients remains problematic, 
mainly because of the limited exposure, the reduced sample size and the high heterogeneity and lack 
of controlled data. Overall, the safety profile in paediatric patients is in line with what was observed in 
adults. Additional safety data in adolescent will be provided as part of the SOB.  
Even though the safety data in patients 12-18 years of age is scarce, considering the life-threatening 
nature of the disease and that entrectinib should only be used when there are no satisfactory 
treatment options (i.e., for which clinical benefit has not been established, or where such treatment 
options have been exhausted), The benefit risk is considered positive in this patient population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
ROS1 positive advanced NSCLC 
The ORR and DoR are similar to what was seen with crizotinib (Xalkori), and deemed outstanding and 
clinically meaningful; i.e. very likely to translate into a clinically relevant PFS effect. The safety profile 
does not raise concerns that this benefit would be offset by toxicity in the relevant treatment setting. 
The balance of benefits and risks can be established as positive based on the outstanding activity and 
a reasonable characterisation of the safety profile. While preliminary data indicating clinically relevant 
activity are available, the extent of benefit in the important subgroup of patients with brain metastases 
is not clarified. Therefore, a PAES to address the latter issue, as well as to generate some comparative 
safety data, in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 indent c), is 
mandated.  
NTRK fusion positive solid tumours 
The overall activity in NTRK-positive tumours is deemed clinically meaningful in a setting where non-
targeted therapies are either not established, or where such treatment options have been exhausted. 
The extent to which tissue of origin and concomitant genetic alterations are effect modifiers, is not 
completely understood. Data are not deemed comprehensive and need further exploration through 
post authorisation measures. The benefit is not offset by the emerging safety profile. 
 
 
The dose recommendation in children is based on data from popPK analysis. In light of the updated 
popPK model and considering all the simulations provided, an indication has been considered possible 
to be granted in adolescents (≥ 12 years). 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
ROS1 NSCLC indication: A PAES to address the activity of entrectinib in patients with CNS disease 
(in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 indent c)), has been 
imposed by the CHMP. The proposed study is an open-label randomized 1:1 RCT of entrectinib vs 
crizotinib in 1L (i.e. TKI naïve and no prior systemic therapy) in ROS1 NSCLC patients with and without 
brain metastases at baseline (both measurable and non-measurable). Based on the rate of accrual 
observed to date, the Applicant plans to enrol 220 patients, of whom at least 30% (66 pts, i.e. 33 per 
arm) will be ensured to have baseline CNS metastases. Patients will be stratified by brain metastases 
(no CNS/measurable CNS/non-measurable CNS disease) and prior brain RT <2 months (yes/no). The 
primary endpoint is PFS per RECIST 1.1 by IRC in the subpopulation with CNS metastases at baseline. 
A total of 49 PFS events in 56 months after first patient in are expected, assuming PFS 8 vs 14 months 
(HR 0.57). The minimum detectable difference (MDD) would be HR=0.692, corresponding to a gain of 
3.6 months in median PFS. A two-sided alpha of 20%, and power 75% have been used. CNS-PFS in 
the entire population is a secondary endpoint. The targeted filing of the clinical study report is in 2027.  
The target population and the sample size calculation based on the assumptions made by the Applicant 
appear overall reasonable. It is acknowledged that the available data for crizotinib are extremely 
limited to make precise assumption of PFS in patients with brain metastases.  
The minimum detectable difference in median PFS (3.6 month of improvement) could be considered of 
some relevance in patients with brain metastases at baseline, although effect on other time related 
endpoint such as PFS2 and OS should be continued to be collected to ensure no late detrimental effect. 
PFS in the overall ITT population will be collected, together with data on the first site of recurrence in 
both populations.  
The Applicant selected a “relaxed” alpha of 20% for the primary endpoint (and a power of 75%), 
justified in order to allow the study to be completed within a reasonable timeframe, in keeping with 
estimated recruitment of 1.2 CNS efficacy evaluable patients per month.  
Quality aspects: 
During the procedure the Applicant informed the CHMP that the proposed drug substance manufacturer 
failed to reproduce the desired active substance Form A due to unexpected events and that the 
manufacturing site is not capable of further sourcing Form A. The Applicant has decided to change the 
active substance polymorphic form for the product and to use the Form C polymorph, and to modify 
the final manufacturing step of the active substance in order to assure that the desired polymorph is 
consistently produced. Based on the extensive characterisation studies, a detailed assessment was 
conducted to demonstrate the comparability of entrectinib Form C with entrectinib Form A. It was 
demonstrated that Form C is comparable to Form A in terms of chemical and physical properties and 
stability. Forms A and C were further compared in a clinical bioequivalence study (BE41049) and 
bioequivalence of Form A and Form C in the finished product was demonstrated. 
Based on the demonstrated bioequivalence between finished products formulated with Form A and 
Form C and the physico-chemical comparability of the active substance of these two polymorphic 
forms, and the unmet medical need of the product, the CHMP has carefully considered and determined 
that this approach can be accepted. The traceability of the polymorphic form is assured as polymorphic 
 
 
form testing is part of the active substance specifications, linking this information with finished product 
batches under GMP requirements. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available for the treatment of patients with tumours 
that harbour NTRK1/2/3, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the 
initial submission. 
The product, which aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease, falls within the scope of Article 
14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional marketing authorisations. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
A plan for specific obligation (SOB1 and SOB2) has been proposed, which is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP: 
Specific Obligation number 1 (SOB-1) by 31 March 2027 
- In order to further confirm the histology-independent efficacy of entrectinib in adult and 
paediatric patients, the MAH should submit a pooled analysis for an increased sample size of 
NTRK fusion-positive patients from the ongoing studies STARTRK-2, STARTRK-NG and any 
additional clinical trial conducted according to an agreed protocol. The MAH should submit the 
results of an interim safety and efficacy analysis of the NTRK efficacy-evaluable adult and 
paediatric patients including adolescents that are available as per integrated statistical analysis 
plan.   
The Applicant is planning to include 139 additional NTRK fusion positive efficacy evaluable patients (61 
already recruited) for a total of about 200 patients in the upcoming years 2020-2026, with March 2027 
as deadline for submission (4 years for recruitment, 1 year of follow up and 1 year to analyse data and 
present the dossier). The projection is based on the observed recruitment in STARTRK-2 study so far 
(2.85 patients per month). About 30 pediatric patients are planned to be presented within the SOS 
(i.e. 22-27 patients < 12 years and 3-5 patients aged >=12 years). Interim safety and efficacy 
analysis will be submitted by end 2023. Efficacy data from the interim analysis should be presented for 
the overall efficacy-evaluable population as well as by histology/tumor site. Lack of efficacy within a 
certain tumor type will be defined by the Applicant as less than 4 responders in a group of sequentially 
enrolled 13 patients (i.e., ORR <30%), which would trigger information to EMA. In order to further 
characterize the safety profile of entrectinib in patients aged ≥12 and <18 years, additional safety data 
will be provided post-approval. The Applicant will submit a safety report in all entrectinib-treated 
adolescent patients from STARTRK-NG (CO40778) and any other study with entrectinib where 
adolescent patients are enrolled. The report would include (but not limited to) assessment on growth 
and development and important risks such as bone fractures, neurocognitive disorders, CHF and QT 
interval prolongation. The safety report will be submitted by the end of 2023, in order to align with the 
SOB-1 interim timelines. 
Specific Obligation number 2 (SOB-2) by 31 March 2027 
- In order to further investigate the impact of the presence/absence of other molecular 
alteration on the efficacy of entrectinib, the MAH should submit the results from tumour 
 
 
genomic profiling by plasma and/or tissue when possible at baseline and progression together 
with clinical outcomes association per tumour histology for the patients from the updated 
pooled analysis.  
The Applicant will continue collecting plasma for circulating tumour DNA analysis and tumour tissue 
when medically feasible, and will use NGS to correlate the following with clinical outcomes: NTRK 
fusion status and partners, concurrent oncogenic driver mutations, and concurrent additional 
alterations. Biomarker associations may not be statistically powered for correlation analyses given the 
rarity and diversity of biomarker alterations. Foundation Medicine F1 CDx for tissue samples and 
Foundation Medicine F1Liquid CDx for ctDNA (the latter platform will complete analytical validation 
studies in 2021, will be CE marketed and anticipated to conform to IVDR in 2022) in plasma samples 
will be used to identify genomic alterations at baseline and progression when medically feasible.  
It is understood that a percentage of patients won’t be identified with the selected assay due to the 
lack of intronic NTRK3 coverage of FoundationOne CDx. To overcome this issue, an RNA component to 
FoundationOne CDx would be needed. The Applicant will update the EMA on whether implementation 
and/or changes of the test would occur in the context of the annual renewal.  
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the sought indication for entrectinib is intended for 
patients with NTRK gene fusion solid tumours in advanced stages with no (further) standard therapies 
available. Such conditions are generally associated with poor prognosis and limited survival; the main 
goal of treatment is palliation, with cure rarely achieved. Uncertainties remain on the precise estimates 
of efficacy and on the activity across tumour types, which will be addressed within the SOB. In the 
same setting, Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) recently received a conditional marketing approval in EU. 
According to EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev.1, “for the demonstration of fulfilment of unmet medical 
needs by a second or subsequent product, the accumulated clinical data and residual uncertainties 
concerning the effects of an already conditionally authorised medicine(s) should be taken into account. 
While the specific obligations are not yet fully completed, it is not possible to confirm the full benefit of 
a conditionally authorised product, therefore another medicinal product could potentially address the 
same unmet medical needs, provided it is expected, based on appropriate scientific data, that such a 
product addresses the unmet medical needs to a similar or greater extent than what is understood for 
the already conditionally authorised product.” Higher ORR has been apparently seen in diseases where 
NTRK fusion is pathognomonic compared to other solid tumours, and this is observed in the data 
presented for both entrectinib and larotrectinib.  Despite the limitations of cross-study comparison also 
due to heterogeneity in dataset composition and the small number of subjects representing each 
tumour types, the available data support the conclusion that both medicines address the unmet 
medical need to a similar extent. 
In the CMA justification, the Applicant discussed the issue of blood brain barrier permeability and the 
condition of P-gp substrate for entrectinib. The submitted Apical ER model is not soundly validated to 
substantiate the statement that entrectinib is a weak substate of P-gp as compared to larotrectinib or 
crizotinib and, moreover, it cannot be concluded that entrectinib is not at all a P-gp substrate as 
reported in the SmPC. Besides the drug behavior towards the P-gp, what is also to be considered is the 
level of expression of P-gp which differs from normal brain (high expression) and in malignant primary 
brain tumors and metastatic tumors to the brain (low expression) suggesting that MDR mechanisms 
other than P-gp could be involved in their weak response to chemotherapy (Demeule et al., 2011). 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
It is concluded that Rozlytrek has a positive benefit/risk in the intended indication subject to the 
agreed specific obligations. 
 
 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rozlytrek is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Rozlytrek is not similar to Onivyde, Nexavar, Yondelis, 
Cometriq, Bavencio, Lutathera, Zejula, Qarziba and Mepact within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix X 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Rozlytrek is favourable in the following indication: 
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of 
age and older, with solid tumours that have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene 
fusion,  
- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result 
in severe morbidity, and 
- who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor 
- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ROS1-positive, 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors.  
The CHMP therefore recommends  the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall submit the first PSUR for this product within 6 months 
following authorisation. 
 
 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy 
of entrectinib in patients with baseline CNS disease, the MAH should conduct and 
submit the results of a randomised controlled trial versus crizotinib in treatment 
naïve ROS1 NSCLC patients. The primary endpoint will be PFS in the subgroup of 
patients with CNS metastases at baseline.  
Due date 
31 December 
2027 
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
In order to further confirm the histology-independent efficacy of entrectinib in adult 
and paediatric patients, the MAH should submit a pooled analysis for an increased 
sample size of NTRK fusion-positive patients from the ongoing studies STARTRK-2, 
STARTRK-NG and any additional clinical trial conducted according to an agreed 
protocol. The MAH should submit the results of an interim safety and efficacy analysis 
of the NTRK efficacy-evaluable adult and paediatric patients including adolescents 
that are available as per integrated statistical analysis plan.   
Due date 
31 March 2027 
In order to further investigate the impact of the presence/absence of other molecular 
31 March 2027 
alteration on the efficacy of entrectinib, the MAH should submit the results from 
tumour genomic profiling by plasma and/or tissue when possible at baseline and 
progression together with clinical outcomes association per tumour histology for the 
patients from the updated pooled analysis. 
 
 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that entrectinib is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0010/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

Rozlytrek EMEA/H/C/004936/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of Rozlytrek for the following indications: 
1) Rozlytrek as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 12 years of 
age and older, with solid tumour that have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result 
in severe morbidity, and 
- who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor 
- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see section 4.4 and 5.1). 
2)  Rozlytrek  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  ROS1-positive, 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reason for divergent opinion on the NTRK fusion positive solid tumours indication, is the following: 
Though it is acknowledged that entrectinib is active in the proposed target population, the overall dataset 
is considered too limited to conclude that the data represent clinical benefit. Notably, due to the small 
sample size, also small changes in the size of even the largest cohorts would have large effects on the 
ORR. This means that, while the safety profile is deemed manageable, there is such an uncertainty on 
the observed activity that we cannot conclude on a positive B/R and, in the context of the applied CMA, 
also not whether the available results address the unmet medical need to a similar or greater extent to 
what 
is  understood 
for 
the  already  conditionally  authorised  product  (as 
laid  down 
in 
EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev.1). 
CHMP Members expressing a divergent opinion:  
Johannes Lodewijk Hillege  
Martina Weise

The reason for divergent opinion on the ROS1-positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
indication is the following:  
This application is based on a pooled efficacy analysis, composed of the subpopulation of adult patients 
with ROS1-positive NSCLC treated across three single-arm studies in adult patients with solid tumors 
(ALKA, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2). It is acknowledged that Rozlytrek in this pooled explorative dataset 
showed antitumour activity by inducing objective responses  of some durability. However, the dataset 
cannot be considered comprehensive as it is small, the analysis exploratory and, in addition, time related 
endpoints  are  difficult  to  interpret  because  of  a  lack  of  comparative  data.  Furthermore,  a  major 
therapeutic  advantage  over  existing  therapies,  which  is  required  for  a  conditional  marketing 
authorization, cannot be demonstrated by the current data.  
Feasibility  of  the  proposed  PAES  study  comparing  entrectinib  with  crizotinib  is  questioned  once 
entrectinib  is  approved  and  the  targeted  reporting  date  of  the  PAES  in  2027  or  even  later  is  not 
acceptable.

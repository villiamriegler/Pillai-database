1.  Introduction 
On November2023, the MAH submitted a paediatric study for Entyvio, in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.  
The study was interrupted (no for safety reasons) and the development of the drug for this indication 
interrupted for adults and paediatric patients.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that    Study  n°  Vedolizumab-3035  “A  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled, 
Multicenter  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Vedolizumab  in  the  Prophylaxis  of  Intestinal 
Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Subjects Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell” is part of 
a clinical development program.  
The MAH submits a clinical study report (early termination) in accordance to Article 46 of the Paediatric 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, for study vedolizumab-3035. 
Study  Vedolizumab-3035  was  included  in  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  EMEA-000645-PIP03-18. 
The age entry criteria for this study included subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg at the time 
of randomization. While the PIP stipulated this study (planned for adults) to have enrollment open to 
adolescents, it did not specify a minimum number for this age group.  
Out  of  the  343  enrolled  subjects,  only  1  was  aged  <18  years  at  entry  (placebo  subject),  and  no 
subgroup analyses were conducted for subjects aged ≥12 to <18 years. 
Enrollment  was  terminated  early,  and  the  study  completed  on  09  May  2022,  primarily  due  to  low 
subject  recruitment  and  enrollment  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (since  February  2020).  The 
decision  was  influenced  by  multiple  factors,  none  of  which  were  related  to  safety  concerns  regarding 
the use of vedolizumab in this patient population. 
The  MAH  decided to  discontinue  development  of  vedolizumab  for  use  in  this condition, in  both  adults 
and paediatrics. 
Following  early  termination  of  enrollment  into  Study  Vedolizumab-3035,  a  notification  of  PIP 
discontinuation was submitted to the Agency, on 01 June 2022, to withdraw PIP EMEA-000645-PIP03-
18. The measures that had been agreed as part of this PIP are listed in Table 1.a

the Product information with regards to the use of vedolizumab in the paediatric population as a result 
of this study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Vedolizumab for Injection, for Intravenous Use; 
Vedolizumab  Powder  for  Concentrate  for  Solution  for  Infusion;  or  MLN0002  IV)  is  a  lyophilized  solid, 
which after appropriate reconstitution and dilution is intended for intravenous (IV) infusion. It has been 
granted  marketing  approval  in  several  regions,  including  the  United  States  and  European  Union. 
Vedolizumab  IV  is  approved  for  the treatment  of  adults  with  moderately  to  severely  active  ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or 
were  intolerant  to  a  tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  blocker  or  immunomodulator;  or  had  an  inadequate 
response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids.  
Vedolizumab  IV  has  also been developed  for  the  treatment  of  adult patients  with  pouchitis  who have 
undergone  proctocolectomy  and  ileal  pouch-anal  anastomosis  (IPAA)  for  UC  and  have  had  an 
inadequate  response,  lost  response,  or  are  intolerant  to  antibiotic  therapy,  with  marketing  approval 
granted in several countries. As of 19 May 2022, approximately 7094 subjects (healthy or patients with 
UC or CD, pouchitis, melanoma, or undergoing allo-HSCT or with aGvHD involving the intestinal tract) 
have  received  at  least  1  dose  of  vedolizumab  across  all  studies  in  the  clinical  development  program, 
and  global  cumulative  postmarketing  patient  exposure  to  vedolizumab  IV  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately  1,009,238  patient  years.  Overall,  vedolizumab  has  been  well  tolerated  in  clinical 
studies.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study n° Vedolizumab-3035 “A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Prophylaxis of Intestinal Acute Graft-Versus-
Host Disease in Subjects Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation”. 
Clinical study 3035 
Description 
This  was  a  phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  vedolizumab  when  added  to  a  background  aGvHD  prophylaxis  regimen  for 
intestinal aGvHD in subjects undergoing allo-HSCT.  
The  subject  population  consisted  of  subjects  with  hematologic  malignancies  or  myeloproliferative 
disorders for whom allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor was planned, using either peripheral blood or 
bone marrow as the stem cell source. 
The study consisted of a 30-day screening period, 155-day treatment period, a visit on Day +180 after 
allo-HSCT,  and  a  posttreatment  follow-up  period  for  safety  assessments  and  survival  that  were 
completed by 12 months after allo-HSCT.  
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 5/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose Subjects received 7 doses of IV study drug, beginning on Day -1 before allo-HSCT and then on 
Days  +13,  +41,  +69,  +97,  +125,  and  +153  after  allo-HSCT.  The  end-of-treatment  visit  was 
conducted  on  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT.  Subjects  who  discontinued  study  drug  treatment  completed 
an early termination (ET) visit upon discontinuation and a final visit 12 months after allo-HSCT. 
Subjects then participated in posttreatment follow-up that began after the Day +180 visit or after ET, 
included a Day +280 final safety visit (or 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug), and concluded 
12 months after allo-HSCT (final visit/end of study [EOS]). 
In addition, upon study completion or ET, all subjects or their parents/legally acceptable representative 
were  administered  the  long-term  follow-up  (LTFU)  safety  questionnaire  by  telephone  6  months  after 
their last dose of study drug. For all subjects receiving study drug, the investigator completed the EOS 
electronic case report form (eCRF) 12 months after allo-HSCT. 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 6/57 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects  were  followed  for  safety,  development  of  acute  and  chronic  GvHD,  and  OS  for  12  months 
after allo-HSCT or until the subject’s death or withdrawal of consent/assent or termination of the study 
by the sponsor.  
Methods 
Study participants 
The population was chosen because it represents a high-risk, vulnerable population for development of 
intestinal aGvHD, which is widely recognized as a driver for poor outcomes, mortality,  and for whom 
significant  unmet  medical  need  exists  with  no  currently  approved  medical  therapy.  The  incidence  of 
Grade  B-D  aGvHD  has  been  reported  to  be  39%  for  HLA-matched  sibling  donors  and  59%  for  HLA-
matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 1 study (Jagasia et al. 2012) and 33% for matched related donor 
recipients,  51%  in  8/8  HLA-MUD  recipients,  and  53%  in  7/8  HLA-MUD  recipients,  with  OS  (45%) 
lowest  in  the  7/8  HLA-MUD  recipients  (Saber  et  al.  2012).  Among  pediatric  subjects  with  allo-HSCT 
from unrelated donors, up to 56% develop Grade 2 to 4 aGvHD and 29% develop Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD 
(Davies et al. 2009; Rocha et al. 2001). The intestinal tract is often involved in Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD, 
and when the intestinal tract is involved in pediatric patients, NRM increases (Goussetis et al. 2011).

opinion of the investigator, would have confounded the study results or compromised subject safety. 
7. Clinically active systemic infection during screening. 
8. Clinically active cytomegalovirus (CMV), active Clostridium difficile infection colitis or other intestinal 
pathogens during screening. 
Study Sites 
Subjects  were  enrolled  into  this  study  drug  at  95  sites  in  25  countries  worldwide  (19  sites  in  North 
America,  45  in  Europe/Israel,  24  in  Asia/Australia,  and  7  in  South  America).  For  additional  site-and 
region-specific randomization information, see Table 15.1.4. 
Data Monitoring and Adjudication Committees 
A  data  monitoring  committee  (DMC)  was  utilized  in  the  study  for  safeguarding  the  interest  of  study 
participants,  and  assessed  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  interventions  during  the  study  while 
maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  study.  The  DMC  conducted  periodic  scheduled  reviews  of  safety, 
including a protocol-defined interim analysis (IA). 
An  Independent  Adjudication  Committee  (IAC)  was  identified  as  part  of  the  Risk  Minimization  Action 
Plan  for  PML  (RAMP)  program  to  review  new  neurological  signs  and  symptoms  potentially  consistent 
with  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML).  The  IAC  provided  input  regarding  subject 
evaluation and management per the IAC PML project instructions. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of vedolizumab when added to background aGvHD 
prophylaxis  regimen  compared  to  placebo  and  background  aGvHD  prophylaxis  regimen  on  intestinal 
aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 in subjects who received allo-HSCT as treatment for a hematologic 
malignancy or myeloproliferative disorder. 
Safety Objective 
The  safety  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  vedolizumab  when  added  to  background  aGvHD 
prophylaxis regimen compared with placebo and background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy of vedolizumab using a range of clinical responses a 
day +180 (details are reported in the endpoints section).

Sample size 
Assuming  the  event  rate  for  the  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT  was 
34.1% for the placebo group and 21.8% for the vedolizumab IV group, and the rate of loss-to-follow-
up  was  10%  for  both  groups,  a  sample  size  of  279  subjects  per  group  (558  subjects  total)  was 
expected to generate 148 events for the intestinal aGvHD-free survival, and hence provide 90% power 
at  the  at  alpha  of  0.05  for  a  2-sided  hypothesis  based  on  log-rank  test.  Assuming  the  event  rate  for 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 9/57 
 
 
 
 
the  intestinal  aGvHD-free  and  relapse-free  survival  was  39.5%  for  the  placebo  group  and  27.1%  for 
the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  this  sample  size  was  expected  to  generate  177  events  for  the  intestinal 
aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival and hence provide approximately 86% power at alpha of 0.05 for 
a 2-sided hypothesis. 
The  study  closed  with  a  total  of  343  subjects  enrolled  (with  71  primary  efficacy  events)  of  the  558 
subjects originally planned (with an estimated 148 primary efficacy events anticipated).  
IA  An  IA  for  futility  and  sample  size  re-estimation was  conducted  after 31% of  the targeted primary 
endpoint  events  (specifically,  46  intestinal  aGvHD/death  events  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT)  were 
accrued. The analysis was performed by an independent statistical center (ie, an external vendor) in a 
manner  that  maintained  blinding  for  the  sponsor  study  team,  investigators,  and  subjects.  IA  results 
were reviewed by the DMC, but not the sponsor.  
The

was 
considered 
non 
binding. 
At  the  time  of  the  IA,  256  subjects  had  been  randomized  (130  to  vedolizumab  IV,  126  to  placebo). 
This  analysis  included  the  primary  endpoint:  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  after  allo-
HSCT. 
There  were

estimates by Day +180 were 85.04% in the vedolizumab IV group and 74.76% in the placebo group. 
The  HR 
(vedolizumab 
IV  vs  placebo)  was  0.52,  and 
the 
conditional  power  was 
0.989. 
Based on the review of IA data, the DMC recommended to continue the trial without modification.  
Treatments 
Treatments Administered 
Vedolizumab and placebo 
Selection of Vedolizumab Dose in the Study 
The  vedolizumab  IV  dose  selected,  300  mg,  was  based  on  safety,  efficacy,  and  PK  data  from  Study 
Vedolizumab-1015  and  the  IBD  program.  This  dosing  regimen  was  estimated  to  provide  serum 
concentrations above 10 μg/mL for 180 days. 
The  300  mg  dose  of  vedolizumab  was  well  tolerated  in  subjects  in  Study  Vedolizumab-1015  without 
delay of engraftment (median 14 days for the 300 mg vedolizumab IV cohort) or new safety concerns. 
In this study, vedolizumab dosing was repeated during the 6 months after the allo-HSCT, during which 
time subjects were at the highest risk of developing intestinal aGvHD.  
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 10/57 
 
 
 
 
 
The  same  vedolizumab  dose  regimen  administered  to  adults  (aged  ≥18  years)  who  underwent  allo-
HSCT for prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD was considered appropriate for administration to adolescents 
aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg. In phase 3 studies in adults with IBD, body weights ranged from 
28.7  to  170  kg.  Safety  data  from  these  studies  showed  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and a similar safety profile in adults receiving vedolizumab IV every 
8 weeks or every 4 weeks. A population PK model was developed using pooled phase 1, 2, and 3 study 
data  from  the  vedolizumab  IV  clinical  program  in  adults  with  UC  or  CD  to  characterize  the  PK  of 
vedolizumab  and  to  assess  the  impact  of  patient  demographic  characteristics  (eg,  age  and  body 
weight)  on  PK.  This  model  indicated  that  weight-based  dosing  is  not  required  and  that  age  is  not  a 
clinically meaningful covariate. In addition, results from Study Vedolizumab-1015 indicated that the PK 
of vedolizumab (300 mg) in adults with aGvHD was similar to that in adults with UC or CD. 
Background GvHD prophylaxis Additionally, all subjects received a combination of CNI (CYS or TAC) 
and MTX or MMF (Choi et al. 2014; Reshef 2012; Ruutu et al. 2012), which is commonly prescribed as 
prophylaxis of GvHD for subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin) may have been 
used at the discretion of the treating physician; however, the proportion of subjects receiving ATG did 
not comprise more than approximately 25% of the total number of subjects enrolled into this study. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Excluded Medications and Treatments 
The following is a list of medications and treatments that were prohibited during the study: 
•  Any investigational agent (other than vedolizumab), including agents other than corticosteroids 
for treatment of GvHD. 
•  Checkpoint inhibitors. 
•  Any therapy for aGvHD prophylaxis other than that specified in the inclusion criteria. If 1 of the 
GvHD  prophylaxis  agents  specified  in  the  inclusion  criteria  had  been  discontinued  due  to 
toxicity  and  an  alternative  agent  was  started,  the  subject  was  permitted  to  remain  on  study 
drug after consultation with the medical monitor. 
•  All live vaccines from 30 days before randomization to at least 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug. 
• 
Either  approved  or  investigational  monoclonal  antibody  or  equivalent  biologics  for  the 
treatment  of  other  conditions  (eg,  rheumatoid  arthritis),  other  than  localized  injections  (eg, 
intra-ocular injections for wet macular degeneration).  
Subjects  were  instructed  not  to  take  any  medications,  including  over-the-counter  products,  without 
first consulting with the investigator. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomization  and  stratification:  Subjects  who  met  all  eligibility  criteria  and  provided  written 
informed  consent  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  fashion  to  2  treatment  arms  (vedolizumab  IV  or placebo 
IV) no more than 2 days before the first dose of study drug on Day -1.  
Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  ( ≥ 18  years  or  adolescents  aged  12  to  <18  years),  human 
leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  match  or  mismatch  (8/8  or  7/8),  conditioning  regimen  (myeloablative  or 
reduced intensity conditioning), and treatment with or without ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin).  
There  were  inconsistencies  in  the  information  regarding  one  or  more  stratification  factors  for  22 
subjects  collected  at  the  time  of  randomization  (per  the  IRT)  versus  information  collected  after 
EMA/3254/2023

randomization.  The  original  IRT  data  (collected  at  randomization)  were  used  for  the  main  efficacy 
analyses. 
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
The investigator or the investigator’s designee utilized the IRT to randomize the subject into the study. 
The  medication  ID  number  of  the  study  drug  dispensed  was  then  provided  by  the  IRT  by  email 
notification  to  the  unblinded  site  pharmacist/nurse.  To  maintain  the  blind,  the  IRT  ensured  that  the 
investigator or designee was unaware of the medication ID assigned to the subject.  
Blinding The investigational drug blind was maintained using the IRT.  
Statistical Methods 
The end of treatment (EOT) analysis (ie, primary analysis) for efficacy and safety data was originally 
planned at the EOT, when all subjects completed Day +180 or withdrew from the study, or when the 
planned number of primary endpoint events as determined by the sample size adaptation rule in the IA 
were accrued. However, the sponsor decided to terminate study enrollment early due to the COVID-19 
pandemic  that  resulted  in  a  shift  in  standard  of  care  for  transplant  practice    Subsequently,  the  EOT 
analysis  was  not  performed  as  planned  and  the  SAP  was  amended  to  reflect  this  change.  The  EOS 
Analysis (ie, final analysis) was performed after the final database lock at the end of study. 
All  statistical  testing  was  2-sided,  performed  at  an  alpha  level  of  0.05.  All  Cis  reported  were  2-sided 
95%,  unless  stated  otherwise.  P-values  were  rounded  to  4  decimal  places  before  assessment  of 
statistical significance. 
Table 9.e details how dates and/or censoring were reported for intestinal aGvHD events for the primary 
endpoint. 
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Missing Efficacy Data 
Through  the  end  of  the  double-blind  period,  missing  dichotomous  efficacy  data  (eg,  intestinal  aGvHD 
event  as  dichotomous  endpoint)  were  to  be  handled  using  the  nonresponder  imputation  method,  ie, 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 12/57 
 
 
 
 
 
any subject with missing information for determination of endpoint status was considered as having an 
undesirable outcome in the analysis. 
Missing data for continuous endpoints were imputed using the LOCF method. For subjects without any 
nonmissing  postbaseline  measurement,  the  missing  data  were  to  be  imputed  using  the  baseline 
observation carried forward method. Other missing data imputation methods (eg, multiple imputations 
or repeated measure mixed effects model) may have been explored. 
Missing data for time to event endpoints were not to be imputed. 
Analysis Sets 
Analysis sets included the following: 
Randomized set: All subjects who were randomized. 
Safety analysis set (SAF): All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects in this set 
were  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  actually  received.  This  population  was  used  for  safety 
analysis. 
Full analysis set (FAS): Following the intent-to-treat principle, the FAS included all subjects who were 
randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and underwent allo-HSCT. The analysis was based 
on the treatment to which subjects were randomized. This population was used for efficacy analysis. 
PK population set: Subjects from the SAF with at least 1 posttreatment PK sample collected. 
Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy data were analyzed using the FAS. 
Efficacy endpoints and the associated supporting data were planned to be descriptively summarized by 
age groups. However, since only 1 subject was aged ≤18 years, results were descriptively summarized 
in the overall population.  
Unless stated otherwise, all statistical comparisons were also conducted in the overall population. 
All statistical testing was 2-sided and performed at an alpha level of 0.05. To control the overall type I 
error  rate  for  the  comparison  between  vedolizumab  and  placebo  groups  for  the  primary  and  key 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  the  overall  population,  a  fixed-sequence  testing  approach  was  used. 
Specifically, the statistical testing of the intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival was only to be 
performed if the treatment difference for the primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant (ie, 
p  <0.05).  The  next  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  only  to  be  tested  if  the treatment  difference  for 
the  first  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  significant  (ie,  p  <0.05),  and  so  on  for  each  subsequent 
secondary efficacy endpoint. 
The order of the statistical testing for the primary and key secondary endpoints were as follows: 
1. Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT. 
2. Intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free survival by Day +180. 
3. Grade C-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +180. 
4. NRM by Day +180. 
5. OS by Day +180. 
6. Grade B-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +180. 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 13/57 
 
 
 
 
Testing  of  the  additional  efficacy  endpoints  were  not  multiplicity  adjusted.  Nominal  p-values  are 
presented. 
Per  the  SAP,    sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints  using  corrected  stratification  information  that  was  collected  after  randomization  and 
recorded in the EDC. 
Additionally, HLA compatibility also captured HLA matching (7/8, 8/8) between the study subject and 
an  HLA-compatible  donor.  The  source  of  these  data  was  the  donor  page.  HLA  compatibility  differed 
slightly  from  both  sets  of data  for  HLA  match  (collected  at  randomization  and  recorded  in the  IRT  vs 
corrected stratification information collected after randomization and recorded in the EDC).  
Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The null (H0) and alternative (HA) hypotheses for the primary efficacy endpoint, intestinal aGvHD-free 
survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT, were as follows: 
H0: Intestinal aGvHD-free Survival by Day +180 Vedolizumab = Intestinal aGvHD-free Survival by Day 
+180 Placebo 
HA:  Intestinal  aGvHD-free  Survival  by  Day  +180  Vedolizumab  ≠  Intestinal  aGvHD-free  Survival  by 
Day +180 Placebo 
The  primary  endpoint  was  analyzed  using  the  log-rank  test,  with  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  presented. 
Subjects  without  documented  intestinal  aGvHD  events  or  death  before  reaching  Day  +180  after  allo-
HSCT  were  censored  at  the  date  of  last  assessment/visit/contact  or  Day  +180,  whichever  occurred 
first. Randomized subjects who did not receive any of their assigned study drug were censored at Day 
-1. The statistical significance of treatment effect was tested against a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  also  analyzed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with 
treatment group, stratified by randomization strata. Point estimate of hazard ratio (HR) and the 
corresponding 95% CI are presented herein. The randomization strata are as follows: 
•  Age  (≥18,  ≥12  and  <18).  Note:  Only  1  subject  was  aged  ≥12  and  <18  years;  therefore,  age 
was not used as a stratification factor. 
•  HLA match (7/8, 8/8). 
•  Conditioning regimen (myeloablative, reduced intensity conditioning). 
•  ATG (with, without). 
In addition, summary statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimates by treatment group are provided. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are reported in the endpoints section. 
All time-to-event endpoints were analyzed in a similar way as the primary efficacy endpoint, using log-
rank test in the FAS. Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with treatment group and stratified by 
the randomization strata. Point estimate of HR and the corresponding 95% CI are presented. 
Additional Efficacy Endpoints are reported in the endpoints section. 
All time-to-event endpoints were analyzed in a similar way as the primary efficacy endpoint, using log-
rank test in the FAS, with Kaplan-Meier estimates presented. Nominal p-values are provided. 
Dichotomous  efficacy  endpoints  were  summarized  by  treatment  group  using  descriptive  statistics 
(count,  percentage).  The  nominal  p-value  and  point  estimate  of  treatment  difference  based  on  the 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 14/57 
 
 
 
 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  method  adjusted  for  randomization  stratification  factors  along  with 
95%  Cis  are  presented.  All  subjects  with  missing  data  for  determination  of  status  of  dichotomous 
efficacy  endpoints  were  considered  treatment  failures  or  as  having  an  undesirable  event  in  the 
analysis. 
Duration  of  systemic  immunosuppression  for  GvHD  treatment  by  12  months  after  allo-HSCT,  was 
summarized  descriptively  (n,  mean,  SD,  median,  minimum,  maximum),  and  tested  using  Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test between treatment groups.  
The following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
• 
• 
• 
To  accommodate  the  events  of  interest  that  occurred  within  the  protocol-defined  +/-  7-day 
window, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed by Day +187 after allo-
HSCT. Subjects who did not have an event by Day +187 after allo-HSCT were censored at last 
contact or Day +187 after allo-HSCT, whichever occurred first. 
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed using stratified log-rank test using the 
FAS, stratified by randomization stratification factors. 
Primary  and  secondary  endpoints  (with  the  exception  of  OS)  were  explored  using  competing 
risk analysis to accommodate the competing nature of multiple causes to the same event. 
Due  to  inconsistency(ies)  in  stratification  information  collected  in  the  IRT  versus  the  EDC,  sensitivity 
analysis  for  inconsistency(ies)  among  them  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  study 
endpoints using the corrected stratification information from the EDC. 
Subgroup Analysis applied to the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Exploratory analyses summarized the treatment effects across subpopulations. The treatment effect in 
vedolizumab and placebo and associated 95% Cis are provided for each subgroup. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
The  COVID-19  pandemic  disrupted  various  aspects  of  the  study  conduct,  including  onsite  visits  for 
subjects  and  auditors;  no  other  changes  in  conduct  occurred  during  the  study.  Ultimately,  enrolment 
was  terminated  early  and  the  study  completed  on  09  May  2022,  primarily  due  to  low  subject 
recruitment  and  enrollment  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (since  February  2020).  The  decision  was 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 15/57 
 
 
 
 
 
influenced  by  multiple  factors,  none  of  which  were  related  to  safety  concerns  regarding  the  use  of 
vedolizumab  in  this  patient  population.  Reasons  for  reduced  enrollment  varied  among  sites,  eg,  an 
increased  number  of  excluded  donor  sources  (haploid  transplants),  excluded  medications  (post-
transplantation  cyclophosphamide),  and  increased  use  of  ATG,  for  which  a  25%  cap  had  been  met. 
Additionally,  there  was  continued  competition  for  hospital  and  study  resources,  minimization  of 
hospital  visits  by  patients to  those  considered  strictly  necessary,  and  voluntary  discontinuations  from 
the study due to concerns of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The COVID-19 pandemic affected the following aspects of the planned study conduct: 
• 
For sites that were not able to conduct onsite visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth 
visits  were  conducted  as  an  acceptable  alternative  to  remotely  assess  subject  safety  and 
overall  clinical  status  per  the  schedule  of  study  procedures.  Telehealth  visits  were  done  by 
delegated  site  staff  speaking  directly  with  the  subject  by  telephone  or  other  medium  (eg,  a 
computer-based video communication). 
•  A total of 8 investigator site audits were planned for the study; however, 3 site audits were not 
conducted due to an inability to physically visit sites related to COVID-19 restrictions. 
Furthermore, European regulations did not allow remote access to subject data. The study completed 
before the investigator site audits could be rescheduled for when COVID-19 restrictions allowed. 
Protocol Changes 
A total of 7 amendments to the initial protocol (13 June 2018) were issued. Two of the amendments 
were global and 5 were local (France, Sweden, UK, Norway, and Germany). 
Both  global  protocol  amendments  were  considered  substantial,  and  all  local  amendments  were  non-
substantial.  Although  approved,  no  subjects  were  enrolled under  the  local  Protocol  Amendment  05  in 
Germany.  Study  subjects  were  enrolled  under  all  other  global  and  local  protocols/protocol 
amendments. 
[…] 
Protocol Amendment 6 (Dated 10 June 2019) – Global 
The  primary  purpose  of  this  substantial,  global  protocol  amendment  was  to  consolidate  all  of  the 
preceding  local  amendments  (France,  Sweden,  UK,  Norway,  and  Germany)  into  a  single  global 
amendment  that  included  (1)  the  addition  of  specified  methods  and  time  frame  of  highly  effective 
contraception,  (2)  addition  of  PML  or  tuberculosis  as  examples  of  withdrawal  criteria,  (3)  unblinding 
without  sponsor  permission  in  case  of  medical  emergency,  and  (4)  notification  of  the  competent 
regulatory  authorities  upon  study  termination  or  suspension  along  with  other  local  regulations.  The 
following is a summary of the changes made in the amendment: 
EMA/3254/2023

reporting periods for collection of AEs and SAEs. 
•  Clarification of the timing of the primary analysis for efficacy and safety. 
•  Clarifications to the footnotes of the schedule of events to align with updates to text. 
Protocol Amendment 7 (Dated 18 September 2019) – Global 
The  primary  purpose  of  this  substantial,  global  protocol  amendment  was  to  open  enrollment  to 
adolescent  subjects  aged  ≥ 12  years  and  weighing  ≥ 30  kg,  which  was  a  required  condition  of  the 
European  Medicines  Agency’s  Paediatric  Committee–endorsed  paediatric  investigational  plan  for 
vedolizumab  as  prophylaxis  of  aGvHD  after  allo-HSCT.  The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  changes 
made in the amendment: 
• Clarification of the description of the disease to be treated in adolescent subjects. 
• Addition of results from nonclinical studies related to inclusion of adolescent subjects. 
• Updated human experience as reported in the 9th development safety update report. 
• Updated the study rationale and benefit:risk profile to support the inclusion of adolescent subjects. 
• Addition of data supporting the dose regimen in adolescent subjects. 
• Update to the inclusion criteria impacted by the addition of adolescent subjects. 
• Updated the permitted medications to include use of topical anesthetic in adolescent subjects. 
•  Clarification  to  the  procedures  that  were  to  be  conducted  after  discontinuation  or  withdrawal  of  a 
subject. 
• Addition of height assessment to be collected at the EOS visit. 
• Updated the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements to include female adolescent subjects 
aged ≥12 years. 
•  Addition  of  necessary  age-appropriate  documentation  that  was  to  be  completed  for  adolescent 
subjects.

• Updated the version of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events to be used for the grading 
of AEs. 
• Updated stratification to include age group and data assessments in adolescent subjects. 
•  Updated  the  appendices  regarding  methotrexate  treatment  to  support  the  inclusion  of  adolescent 
subjects,  and  to  include  age-appropriate  assessments  of  aGvHD  clinical  stage  and  MAGIC  severity 
index for aGvHD. 
SAP Changes 
A total of 2 amendments to the original SAP were issued.

Baseline data Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Medical History and Concurrent Medical Conditions 
Medical History 
All 334 study subjects (100% overall) reported medical history. The most commonly reported (≥25.0% 
of subjects overall) medical history terms by SOC were neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(incl  cysts  and  polyps)  (100%),  vascular  disorders  (35.9%),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders 
(34.7%),  gastrointestinal  disorders 
(33.5%),  surgical  and  medical  procedures 
(31.7%),

myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  (43.7%),  hypertension  (29.3%),  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (21.9%),  acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (15.9%), anemia (14.7%), and depression (10.8%). 
Concurrent Medical Conditions 
The  most  commonly  reported  concurrent  condition  terms  by  SOC  were  vascular  disorders  (32.3%), 
metabolism  and  nutrition disorders  (31.1%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (25.1%),  psychiatric  disorders 
(24.0%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (21.0%),  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue

(27.5%),  anemia  (14.4%),  nausea  (9.6%),  depression  (9.6%),  anxiety  (9.0%),  and  hyperlipidemia 
(7.2%). 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics for the FAS are summarized in Table 11.d. 
Overall,  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  vedolizumab  and 
placebo treatment groups. Additionally, the study population (patients undergoing allo-HSCT) was also 
generally  well  balanced  within  the  subgroups  of  conditioning  regimen  and  ATG  use  and  for  other 
factors influencing the risk of intestinal aGVHD development. 
 Per  protocol,  the  total  number  of  subjects  receiving  ATG  was  not  to  comprise  more  than 
approximately  25%  of  the  total  number  of  subjects  enrolled  into  the  study.  However,  as  enrollment 
terminated early (see Section 9.8), the overall percentage of subjects with ATG at baseline was higher: 
41.1%  (137  subjects)  with  ATG,  and  58.9%  (196  subjects)  without  ATG  per  IRT  data  collected  at 
randomization.

Number analysed 
Data Sets Analyzed 
Analysis  sets  were  the  randomized  set,  safety  analysis  set  (SAF),  full  analysis  set  (FAS),  and  PK 
population  set.  The  analysis  sets  are  defined  in  Section  9.7.1.2  and  summarized  in  Table  11.a. 
Subjects excluded from the analysis set are included in Listing 16.2.3.1. 
A total of 343 subjects were randomized to study treatment: 174 subjects to the 300 mg vedolizumab 
IV group and 169 subjects to the placebo IV group. Overall, 97.1% (169 of 174) and 97.6% (165 of 
169)  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  were  included  in  the  SAF 
(Table 11.a). In the FAS, 96.6% (168 of 174) and 97.6% (165 of 169) of subjects in the vedolizumab 
IV  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  were  included.  One  subject  was  randomized  to  treatment  and 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug  but  did  not  receive  allo-HSCT  per  protocol;  this  subject  was 
included in the SAF but not the FAS. The PK population set included 97.1% (169 of 174) of subjects in 
the vedolizumab IV group. 
Efficacy results  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT  
Definition:  Intestinal  aGvHD  was  defined  as  Stages  1  through  4  intestinal  involvement  per  aGvHD 
clinical stage criteria. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo 
group  in  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT  (p  <0.001).  The  risk  of  an 
intestinal aGvHD event or death in subjects was 55% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with 
the placebo group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI of HR, 0.27-0.73). 
In  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  there  were  24  subjects  (14.3%)  with  an  observed  event  of  intestinal 
aGvHD  or  death  (any  cause),  whichever  occurred  first,  by  Day  +180  after  allo-HSCT;  in  the  placebo 
group,  there  were  47  subjects  (28.5%)  with  an  observed  event  (Table  11.h).  Of  those  subjects,  12 
(7.1%)  from  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  31  (28.8%)  from  the  placebo  group  had  an  intestinal 
aGvHD  event,  and  12  subjects  (7.1%)  from  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  16  subjects  (9.7%)  from 
the placebo group died.

The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  for  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  was  85.52%  (95%  CI, 
79.17-90.05) for the vedolizumab IV group and 70.85% (95% CI, 63.16-77.22) for the placebo group. 
Figure 11.a presents Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the primary endpoint.

Consistent results were observed for the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, which 
included  the  use  of  the  Day  +187  window,  stratified  log-rank  test,  competing  risk  analysis,  and 
corrected stratification information. 
A  forest  plot  of  subgroup  analyses  for  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  for  the  FAS  is 
presented  in  Figure  11.b.  These  subgroup  analyses  provide  further  support  for  the  benefit  of 
vedolizumab  IV  in  reducing  the  risk  of  intestinal  aGvHD  and  mortality  up  to Day  +180.  In  particular, 
HRs favoring vedolizumab IV were observed in subjects with a 8/8  HLA antigen match with a favorable 
trend in the 7/8 ones (not statistically relevant). Similarly, a favourable effect could be seen in patients 
conditioned  with  the  RIC  regimen  while  only  a  trend  is  recognizable  with  the  myeloablative  one.    A 
positive  effect  was  observed  throughout  the  population  regardless  the  ATG  use  (with  or  without),  or 
stem cell source (peripheral blood or bone marrow). Overall, although in some cases a positive effect 
of  Vedolizumab  was  recognized  in  the  subgroup  analysis,  the  reduced  numbers  of  enrolled  patients 
and,  consequently,  the  small  numbers  of  each  subgroup  could  have  impaired  the  strength  of  this 
analysis.

Secondary Endpoints 
Intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free (of the underlying malignancy) survival by day +180 
Definition: Risk of an intestinal aGvHD event, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first by day 180. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo 
group  in  the  intestinal  aGvHD-free  and  relapse-free  (of  the  underlying  malignancy)  survival  by  Day 
+180  (p  =  0.0043).  The  risk  of  an  event  in  subjects  was  44%  less  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group 
compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.56; 95% CI of HR, 0.37-0.86).  
Although the number of subjects who relapsed was greater in the vedolizumab IV group (18 subjects) 
compared  with  placebo  (13  subjects),  the  total  number  of  subjects  who  relapsed  during  this  study 
through Day +180 was similar between treatment groups (18 subjects in the vedolizumab IV group vs 
17 subjects in the placebo group).   
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  for  intestinal  aGvHD-free  and  relapse-free  survival  by  Day  +180  was 
78.87% (95% CI, 71.83-84.35) for the vedolizumab IV group and 65.35% (95% CI, 57.46-72.13).

Kaplan-Meier Estimated Survival Curves for Intestinal aGvHD-Free Survival by Day +180 – FAS 
The subgroup analysis confirms what previously seen in the primary endpoint for the benefit of 
vedolizumab IV in reducing the risk of intestinal aGvHD and mortality up to Day +180. In particular, 
HRs favoring vedolizumab were observed in subjects with HLA antigen match of 8/8, RIC conditioning 
regimen and with peripheral stem cell source of graft. For the ATG use, patients treated with ATG 
presented a favorable HR. The same concerns raised about the small numbers of patients included in 
each subgroups and, consequently, about the strength of these evidences are valid.   
Grade C-D aGvHD-free survival by Day +180). 
Definition: GVHD grade C-D in any organ involvement based on IBMDR Index by Day +180.  
There was a statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo 
group; the risk of a Grade C-D aGvHD event or death, whichever occurred first, in subjects was 41% 
less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI of HR, 0.39-
0.91). 
In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 35 subjects (20.8%) with an observed event of Grade C-D 
aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +180; in the placebo group, there were 52 subjects 
(31.5%) with an observed event (Table 11.k). Of those subjects, 22 (13.1%) from the vedolizumab IV 
group and 35 (21.2%) from the placebo group had an observed Grade C-D aGvHD event, and 13 
subjects (7.7%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 17 subjects (10.3%) from the placebo group died.

Organ Involvement) Survival by Day +180– FAS 
Although the numbers for each of the subgroup analyses related to standard GvHD prophylaxis 
therapies were small, the results were statistically consistent, suggesting a benefit with the addition 
vedolizumab IV therapy. The same consideration regarding the limits of analysis performed with small 
numbers of patients are valid also for the subgroup analysis of this endpoint. 
Nor Relapse Mortality by Day +180  
Definition: Effect of vedolizumab compared to placebo on NRM in subjects by Day +180 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo 
group in the endpoint of NRM by Day +180 (p = 0.0668). The marginal effect in NRM was observed in 
favor of the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.48; 95% CI of HR, 0.22-
1.04). In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 10 subjects with an observed event of death without 
relapse  by  Day  +180  (6.0%  of  subjects);  in  the  placebo  group,  there  were  19  subjects  with  an 
observed  event  (11.5%  of  subjects).  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  for  NRM  by  Day  +180  was  93.93% 
(95%  CI,  89.01-96.69)  for  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  88.02%  (95%  CI,  81.85-92.19)  for  the 
placebo group.

Overall Survival by day +180 
Definition: the effect of vedolizumab compared to placebo on OS by Day +180 
Per the fixed-sequence hierarchical testing procedure following a prespecified order of primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints, the statistical testing of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint of OS 
was not performed given that the statistical significance of the preceding key secondary efficacy 
endpoint (ie, NRM) was not demonstrated (ie, p >0.05). By Day +180, 17 subjects (10.1%) from the 
vedolizumab IV group and 25 subjects (15.2%) from the placebo group had died. 
Additionally, the nominal p-value for OS by Day +180 between the vedolizumab IV group and the 
placebo group was 0.1458. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for OS by Day +180 was 89.72% (95% CI, 83.98-93.48) for the 
vedolizumab IV group and 84.38% (95% CI, 77.76-89.16) for the placebo group.

Grade B-D aGvHD-free survival, all by Day +180 
Definition: GVHD grade B-D in any organ involvement based on IBMDR Index by Day +180 
Per  the  fixed-sequence  hierarchical  testing  procedure  the  fifth  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  of 
Grade  B-D  aGvHD-free  survival  was  not  tested.  Nominal  p-value  is  provided  instead.  The  nominal  p-
value  for  Grade  B-D  aGvHD-free  survival  by  Day  +180  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the 
placebo group was 0.0105. The risk of a Grade  B-D aGvHD event or death, whichever occurred first, 
was 36% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI of HR, 
0.46-0.91). In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 56 subjects (33.3%) with an observed event of 
Grade B-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day +180; in the placebo group, there were 
77  subjects  (46.7%)  with  an  observed  event  (Table  11.n).  Of  those  subjects,  47  (28.0%)  from  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group  and  64  (38.8%)  from  the  placebo  group  had  an  observed  Grade  B-D  aGvHD 
event, and 9 subjects (5.4%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 13 subjects (7.9%) from the placebo 
group died.

Survival by Day +180 – FAS 
Exploratory Endpoints 
An overview of the exploratory efficacy results by Day +180 and Day +365 is presented above.  
Exploratory  endpoints  by  Day  +365  are  similar  to  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (at 
Day +180) for this study: 
- 
Intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +365 
A total of 21.4% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 33.9% of subjects in the placebo 
group  had  an  observed  event  of  intestinal  aGvHD  or  death  (any  cause),  whichever  occurred 
first, by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.0041; HR, 0.53 [95% CI of HR, 0.35-0.81]). At Day +180, 
there  were  14.3%  and  28.5%  of  subjects  with  an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and 
placebo groups, respectively (p <0.001). 
- 
Intestinal  aGvHD-free  and  relapse-free  (of  the  underlying  malignancy)  survival  by 
Day +365 
A total of 33.3% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 38.8% of subjects in the placebo 
group had an observed event of intestinal aGvHD, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first, 
by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.1676; HR, 0.78 [95% CI of HR, 0.54-1.12]). At Day +180, there 
were 20.8% and 33.9% of subjects with an observed event in the vedolizumab IV and placebo 
groups, respectively (p = 0.0043). 
-  Grade C-D aGvHD-free (based on IBMTR index for any organ involvement) survival by 
Day +365 
A total of 28.0% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 35.8% of subjects in the placebo 
group had an observed event of Grade C-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day 
+365  (nominal  p  =  0.0709;  HR,  0.68  [95%  CI  of  HR,  0.46-1.00]).  At  Day  +180,  there  were 
20.8%  and  31.5%  of  subjects  with  an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo 
groups, respectively (p = 0.0204). 
-  NRM by Day +365 
A total of 8.9% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 15.2% of subjects in the placebo 
group had an observed event of death without relapse by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.0670; HR, 
EMA/3254/2023

0.49 [95% CI of HR, 0.25-0.95]). At Day +180, there were 6.0% and 11.5% of subjects with 
an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo  groups,  respectively  (nominal  p  = 
0.0668).  
-  OS by Day +365 
A total of 16.7% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 21.8% of subjects in the placebo 
group died by Day +365 (nominal p = 0.1741; HR, 0.67 [95% CI of HR, 0.41-1.11]). At Day 
+180,  10.1%  and  15.2%  of  subjects  had  died  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively (nominal p = 0.1458). 
-  Grade B-D aGvHD-free (any organ involvement) survival by Day +365 
A total of 41.1% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 49.7% of subjects in the placebo 
group had an observed event of Grade B-D aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first, by Day 
+365  (nominal  p  =  0.0534;  HR,  0.71  [95%  CI  of  HR,  0.52-0.99]).  At  Day  +180,  there  were 
33.3%  and  46.7%  of  subjects  with  an  observed  event  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  and  placebo 
groups, respectively (nominal p = 0.0105).  
Of  additional  interest  was  Stage  2-4  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival  at  Day  +180  compared  with  Day 
+365.  At  Day  +180,  11.3%  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  20.0%  of  subjects  in  the 
placebo group had an observed event of Stage 2-4 intestinal aGvHD or death, whichever occurred first 
(nominal  p  =  0.0222).  At  Day  +365,  19.0%  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  25.5%  of 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  an  observed  event  of  Stage  2-4  intestinal  aGvHD  or  death, 
whichever occurred first (nominal p = 0.0981) 
Global numbers of events increase during the follow up, from the day +180 to 365; this is consistent 
both with the follow up trend but also with the late onset of aGVHD. The reduced enrolment presented 
an  effect  in  this  subset  analyses,  considering  that  each  analysis  was  conducted  on  small  numbers  of 
patients. Patient’s distribution between the treatment groups were well balanced, with the exception of 
relapse  of  the  underlying  malignancy  by  Day  +365  (19.6%  of  subjects  with  non-missing  data  in  the 
vedolizumab IV group vs 13.3% in the placebo group). 
For  subjects  with  GvHD  requiring 
that 
immunosuppression, 
immunosuppression was required was numerically less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the 
placebo  group  through  Day  +180  (nominal  p  =  0.0151)  but  the  effect  was  lost  through  Day  +365 
(nominal  p  =  0.4882),  suggesting  a  time  limited  efficacy  of  Vedolizumab  in  reducing  the  need  of 
immunosuppression treatments.

Quality of life results 
Results  from  the  FACT-BMT  at  the  Day  +97,  +180,  and  +365  visits  were  similar  between  treatment 
groups for FACT-G (general) and the BMT-specific subscales of physical well-being, social/family well-
being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, bone marrow transplant subscale, and trial outcome 
index. A noted exception was the Day +97 subscale of social/family well-being that had a nominal p-
value of 0.0203 between treatment groups (least-squares [LS] mean difference, -0.98; 95% CI, -1.81 
to -0.15). The change from baseline in FACT total scores between the vedolizumab IV group and the 
placebo  group  (LS  mean  difference  [95%  CI])  was  not  statistically  significant  at  any  time  point 
assessed (p = 0.1420, Day +97; p = 0.7754, Day +180; p = 0.4237, Day +365). A summary of the 
FACT-BMT and change from baseline by visit for the FAS can be found in Table 15.2.38.1.1. 
A numerical benefit was observed in the change from baseline in the EQ visual analog scale (VAS) at 
Day  +180  (LS  mean  difference,  3.93;  95%  CI,  0.08-7.77)  in  favor  of  the  vedolizumab  IV  group 
(minimal  p-value  =  0.0452);  however,  results  were  not  statistically  significant  at  the  Day  +97  (p  = 
0.3786) or Day +365 (p = 0.3570) visits. Additionally, results from the EQ-5D scores at the Day +97, 
+180,  and  +365  visits  were  not  statistically  different  between  treatment  groups  for  the  subscales  of 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, or anxiety/depression at any time point assessed. 
Similarly, the change from baseline in the index scores (US) between the vedolizumab IV and placebo 
groups  was  not  statistically  significant  at  any  time  point  (p  =  0.5089,  Day  +97;  p  =  0.3646,  Day 
+180; p = 0.7315, Day +365).  
Safety results 
AEs  were  coded  using  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  version  24.0,  and 
summarized by System Organ Class (SOC), High-Level Term (HLT), and Preferred Term (PT). AEs were 
also summarized by severity and by relationship to study drug.  
A TEAE was defined as any AE newly occurring or worsening from the first dose and 18 weeks after the 
last dose of study drug. A serious TEAE was defined as any SAE newly occurring or worsening from the 
first  dose  up  to  18  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug,  regardless  of  relationship  to  study  drug. 
SAEs were also collected from 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug until the EOS.  
 Extent of Exposure 
The mean duration of exposure was similar between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group 
(241.7 and 230.0 days, respectively).  
The mean number of doses received was also similar between treatment groups (5.4 doses [SD, 2.05] 
for the vedolizumab IV group and 5.1 doses [SD, 2.25] for the placebo group). Most subjects received

7  doses  of  study  drug  per  protocol  (52.7%  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  50.9%  of 
subjects in the placebo group).

Study Drug-Related TEAEs 
Overall,  26.6%  (89  of  334)  of  subjects  had  a  TEAE  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to 
study drug (48 of 169 subjects [28.4%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 41 of 165 subjects [24.8%] 
in the placebo group) (Table 12.c). Study drug-related TEAEs were similar between the vedolizumab IV 
and placebo groups. 
The  most  frequently  reported  study  drug-related  TEAEs,  by  SOC,  were  investigations  (5.9%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  7.9%  in  the  placebo  group),  infections  and  infestations  (6.5%  in  the

vedolizumab  IV  group,  3.6%  in  the  placebo  group),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (2.4%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  6.7%  in  the  placebo  group),  immune  system  disorders  (3.0%  in  the 
vedolizumab IV group, 5.5% in the placebo group), blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.6% in the 
vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.6% 
in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group) (Table 12.f). 
AEs by Intensity 
Overall,  1756  TEAEs  in  303  subjects  were  Grade  3  or  higher  in  intensity  (Table  12.c  above);  156 
subjects  (92.3%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  had  873  Grade  3  or  higher  events,  and  147  subjects 
(89.1%) in the placebo group had 883 such events.  
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were similar between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group. The 
most  commonly  reported  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs,  by  SOC,  were  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders (62.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 64.2% in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders 
(40.2%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  44.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  investigations  (37.9%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  40.0%  in  the  placebo  group),  infections  and  infestations  (35.5%  in  the 
vedolizumab IV group, 37.0% in the placebo group), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (21.9% in 
the vedolizumab IV group, 23.0% in the placebo group). 
The  most  commonly  reported  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs,  by  PT,  were  anaemia  (29.6%  in  the 
vedolizumab IV group, 31.5% in the placebo group), febrile neutropenia (31.4% in the vedolizumab IV 
group,  29.7%  in  the  placebo  group),  stomatitis  (27.2%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  26.7%  in  the 
placebo  group),  platelet  count  decreased  (21.9%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  24.8% in the  placebo 
group),  neutropenia  (17.2%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  17.0%  in  the  placebo  group),  and 
thrombocytopenia  (17.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  16.4%  in  the  placebo  group)  (Table 
15.3.1.14).  All  other  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs  were  each  reported  for  29  subjects  or  fewer  in  the 
vedolizumab IV group. 
No clinically meaningful difference in Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were found between the vedolizumab IV 
group and the placebo group. 
Treatment-Emergent AESIs 
Overall,  321  subjects  (96.1%)  reported  a  total  of  1635  treatment-emergent  AESIs;  161  subjects 
[95.3%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  reported  857  treatment-emergent  AESIs,  and  160  subjects 
[97.0%] in the placebo group reported 778 treatment-emergent AESIs. The treatment-emergent AESI 
data suggest comparable safety profiles between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group.

Serious Infections 
A total of 633 treatment-emergent AESIs of serious infection were reported for 236 subjects (70.7%) 
overall,  with  a  numerically  higher  incidence  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  (125  subjects  [74.0%]) 
compared with the placebo group (111 subjects [67.3%]).  
The  most  commonly  reported  treatment-emergent  serious  infections,  by  PT,  were  CMV  infection 
reactivation (23.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 18.2% in the placebo group), pneumonia (7.7% in 
the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  8.5%  in  the  placebo  group),  sepsis  (5.3%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 
7.3% in the placebo group), Candida infection (4.7% in the vedolizumab IV group, 4.2% in the placebo 
group),  urinary  tract  infection  (3.6%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  4.8%  in  the  placebo  group), 
Epstein-Barr  virus  infection  reactivation  (4.1%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  3.6%  in  the  placebo 
group), nasopharyngitis (5.3% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% in the placebo group), Clostridium 
difficile  infection  (5.9%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  1.2%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  conjunctivitis 
(3.6% in each treatment group).  
Seven  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  had  at  least  1  SAE  of  pneumonia  (including  PTs  of 
Pneumocystis 
jiroveci  pneumonia,  pneumonia  pseudomonal,  pneumonia  bacterial,  organising 
pneumonia, and pneumonia pneumococcal); 3 subjects had 2 SAEs of pneumonia, and 1 subject had 3 
events.  Ten  events  resolved  or  were  resolving  at  study  completion,  and  1  subject  died.  Two  of  the 
SAEs of pneumonia were considered related to study drug; for both events, study drug was withdrawn. 
No other SAEs of pneumonia were related to study drug. 
Seven  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  had  at  least  1  SAE  of  sepsis  (including  PTs  of 
staphylococcal sepsis and Klebsiella sepsis) (Listing 16.2.7.3). Six events resolved or were resolving at 
study completion, and 1 event did not resolve. None of the events were related to study drug. 
One subject in the vedolizumab IV group had an SAE of urinary tract infection. The event resolved and 
was not considered related to study drug. 
PML 
A total of 3 subjects (1.8%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 2 subjects (1.2%) in the placebo group 
were listed as having “PML” in the clinical trial database (Table 12.h). In none of these cases was PML 
EMA/3254/2023

listed as a PT; however, all were identified because they were reported to have had a TEAE (by PT) of 
Human  polyomavirus  infection.  This  PT  was  included  as  an  event  under  the  definition  of  an  AESI, 
possibly  suggestive  of  PML.  An  additional  subject  was  confirmed  as  having  PML.  This  subject  had  an 
AML status posttransplant and received a total of 6 doses of vedolizumab IV. Approximately 6 months 
after  the  last  dose  of  vedolizumab  IV,  the  subject  developed  AML  relapse  and  aGvHD,  for  which  the 
subject  received  intense  immunosuppressive  therapy  with  IV  steroids,  tacrolimus,  and  azacytidine. 
Approximately  1  month  later,  the  subject  developed  the  SAE  of  PML,  with  a  fatal  outcome.  The 
investigator  and  the  IAC  deemed  that  the  event  of  PML  was  due  to  acute  GvHD  and  “heavy” 
immunosuppression treatment that was unrelated to vedolizumab IV. This case is not listed as a TEAE 
of  PML  (by  PT)  in  the  clinical  trial  database  because  the  event  of  PML  occurred  more  than  18  weeks 
after the last dose of study drug. The subject died after completing the study. 
Malignancy 
Malignancies, including relapse of the primary disease, were captured as AESIs and presented by SOC, 
HLT, and PT. 
A total of 71 treatment-emergent AESIs of malignancy were reported for 55 subjects (16.5%) overall 
(29  subjects  [17.2%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  26  subjects  [15.8%]  in  the  placebo  group) 
(Table  12.h).  Treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy  were  similar  between  the  vedolizumab  IV 
group and the placebo group and consistent with a population of subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. 
The  most  common  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy,  by  PT,  were  acute  myeloid  leukaemia 
recurrent (5.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 5.5% in the placebo group), myelodysplastic syndrome 
(3.0%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  1.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  acute  lymphocytic  leukaemia 
recurrent (1.8% in the vedolizumab IV group, 0.6% in the placebo group), chronic myeloid leukaemia 
recurrent  (1.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  0.6%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  posttransplant 
lymphoproliferative disorder (none in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.8% in the placebo group).  
Liver Injuries 
A total of 292 treatment-emergent AESIs of liver injury were reported for 137 subjects (41.0%) overall 
(68  subjects  [40.2%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  69  subjects  [41.8%]  in  the  placebo  group) 
(Table  12.h).  Treatment-emergent  liver  injuries,  by  SOC,  included  investigations  (33.7%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  33.3%  in  the  placebo  group),  hepatobiliary  disorders  (10.1%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  8.5%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (0.6%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  2.4%  in the placebo  group).  The  most  common treatment-emergent  AESIs  of 
liver  injury,  by  PT,  were  alanine  aminotransferase  increased  (24.9%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 
17.6%  in  the  placebo  group),  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased  (18.9%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV 
group,  15.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  blood  bilirubin  increased  (13.0%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 
16.4% in the placebo group), hepatic function abnormal (4.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 6.7% in 
the placebo group), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (4.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 2.4% 
in  the  placebo  group),  and  hyperbilirubinaemia  (5.3%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  none  in  the 
placebo group).  
Hypersensitivity Reactions Including IRRs and Injection Site Reactions 
A total of 618 treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site 
reactions were reported for 270 subjects (80.8%) overall (134 subjects [79.3%] in the vedolizumab IV 
group  and  136  subjects  [82.4%]  in  the  placebo  group)  (Table  12.h).  The  high  incidence  of 
hypersensitivity  reactions 
is  confounded  by  the  background/conditioning  regimen  that  was 
administered 1 day before study drug dosing. 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 45/57 
 
 
 
 
The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection 
site reactions, by SOC, were gastrointestinal disorders (55.0% in the vedolizumab IV group, 57.6% in 
the  placebo  group);  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (27.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 
30.9%  in  the  placebo  group);  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (26.6%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  31.5%  in  the  placebo  group);  renal  and  urinary  disorders  (16.0%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  18.8%  in  the  placebo  group);  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders (8.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 7.3% in the placebo group). 
The most common treatment-emergent AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection 
site  reactions,  by  PT,  were  stomatitis  (54.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  56.4%  in  the  placebo 
group), oedema peripheral (17.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 21.1% in the placebo group), pruritus 
(16.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 20.0% in the placebo group), acute kidney injury (14.2% in the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  15.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  erythema  (13.6%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV 
group, 7.9% in the placebo group).  
Leukopenia or Lymphopenia 
A total of 26 treatment-emergent AESIs of leukopenia and lymphopenia were reported for 21 subjects 
(6.3%)  overall,  which  is  consistent  with  the  patient  population  (subjects  undergoing  allo-HSCT  and 
taking concomitant immunosuppressants). There were 14 subjects (8.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group 
and 7 subjects (4.2%) in the placebo group with an AESI of leukopenia or lymphopenia (Table 12.h). 
Nine subjects (5.3%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 6 subjects (3.6%) in the placebo group had a 
treatment-emergent  AESI  of  leukopenia.  Five  subjects  (3.0%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  1 
subject  (0.6%)  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  treatment-emergent  AESI  of  lymphopenia  (Table 
15.3.1.26).  Although  the  incidence  of  leukopenia  and  lymphopenia  were  numerically  higher  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group,  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  was 
observed  between  treatment  groups  given  the  small  number  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  event  of 
leukopenia or lymphopenia. 
CMV Reactivation 
A  total of  115 treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  CMV  reactivation  were  reported for  83  subjects  (24.9%) 
overall  (45  subjects  [26.6%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  38  subjects  [23.0%]  in  the  placebo 
group) (Table 12.h). Forty subjects (23.7%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 30 subjects (18.2%) in 
the placebo group had CMV infection reactivation; 3 subjects (1.8%) in each treatment group had CMV 
infection,  1  subject  (0.6%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  3  subjects  (1.8%)  in  the  placebo  group 
had  CMV  viraemia,  and  1  subject  (0.6%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  3  subjects  (1.8%)  in  the 
placebo  group  had  CMV  test  positive.  In  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  7  subjects  had  9  SAEs  of  CMV 
reactivation or active CMV infection (verbatim terms) that required or prolonged hospitalization. In the 
placebo group, 2 subjects each had 1 SAE of CMV reactivation. All 9 SAEs in the vedolizumab IV group 
resolved or were resolving at study completion, and no event led to study drug interruption. None of 
the events were related to study drug. 
Deaths 
A  total  of  65  subjects  (19.5%  of  the  SAF)  who  participated  in  this  study  died.  A  total  of  48  subjects 
had  a  TEAE  resulting  in  death  (21  subjects  [12.4%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  27  subjects 
[16.4%] in the placebo group) (Table 12.i). The treatment-emergent period (for TEAEs) was defined as 
the period from administration of the first dose of study drug through 18 weeks after the last dose of 
study  drug.  The  leading  causes  of  death  included  multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome  (3.0%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  1.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  recurrent  (0.6%  in  the 
vedolizumab  IV  group,  2.4%  in  the  placebo  group),  respiratory  failure  (1.8%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV 
group, 1.2% in the placebo group), pneumonia (1.2% each in both treatment groups), and sepsis (no 
EMA/3254/2023

subjects in the vedolizumab IV group, 1.8% in the placebo group). All other causes of death occurred 
in  2  subjects  (0.6%)  or  fewer  overall.  None  of  the  TEAEs  resulting  in  death  in  the  vedolizumab  IV 
group were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug (Listing 16.2.7.5).  
An  additional  17  subjects  (5.1%)  died  after  the  6-month  treatment-emergent  period  (ie,  18+  weeks 
after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug):  8  subjects  (4.7%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  9  subjects 
(5.5%) in the placebo group. 
Other SAEs

Serious drug-related TEAE 
 A  total  of  62  subjects  (18.6%)  had  at  least  1  SAE  beyond  the  treatment-emergent  period  (ie,  18 
weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug):  36  subjects  (21.3%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  26 
subjects (15.8%) in the placebo group.  
Reported  SAEs  beyond  the  treatment-emergent  period  were  similar  between treatment  groups;  most 
events occurred in only 1 subject per treatment group at the PT level.  
Serious COVID-19–Related TEAEs 
Overall, 2 subjects (0.6%) had at least 1 serious COVID-19–related TEAE; 1 subject in each treatment 
group.  No  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  COVID-19–related  TEAEs  was  observed  between 
treatment groups. 
TEAEs Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation 
Overall,  95  subjects  (28.4%)  had  at  least  1  TEAE  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation;  44  subjects 
(26.0%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 51 subjects (30.9%) in the placebo group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation,  by  SOC,  were  immune 
system disorders (5.3% in the vedolizumab IV group, 12.1% in the placebo group); neoplasms benign, 
malignant  and  unspecified  (incl  cysts  and  polyps)  (7.1%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  6.7%  in  the 
placebo  group);  investigations  (3.6%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  2.4%  in  the  placebo  group); 
EMA/3254/2023

infections  and  infestations  (2.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  3.0%  in  the  placebo  group);  and 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.8% in each treatment group).  
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation,  by  PT,  were  acute  graft 
versus host disease in intestine (1.2% in the vedolizumab IV group, 7.3% in the placebo group), acute 
myeloid leukaemia recurrent (2.4% in the vedolizumab IV group, 3.0% in the placebo group), alanine 
aminotransferase increased (3.6% in the vedolizumab IV group, 0.6% in the placebo group), and acute 
graft versus host disease (1.8% in the vedolizumab IV group and 1.2% in the placebo group) (Table 
12.l). All other events were reported for 4 subjects or fewer overall. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Serum Chemistry 
Liver injury has been reported among AESI.  
Kidney: a total of 50 subjects (15.0%) overall had at least 1 AESI of acute kidney injury: 24 subjects 
(14.2%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  26  subjects  (15.8%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Twenty-three 
subjects  (13.6%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  had  markedly  abnormal  creatinine  values  throughout 
the study compared with 22 subjects (13.3%) in the placebo group. 
Hematology 
In general, markedly abnormal hematology results were similar between treatment groups throughout 
the study. 
Failure  to  engraft  by  Day  +28  was  considered  as  primary  graft  failure  and  was  reported  as  an  SAE. 
Most study subjects (97.3% overall) had a successful engraftment. Three subjects in the vedolizumab 
IV  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  life-threatening  SAE  of  engraftment.  For  2  of  the  3 
subjects, the event occurred in the treatment-emergent period; study drug was therefore withdrawn. 
None  of  the  events  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug,  and  all  subjects 
recovered. 
Neutrophil  engraftment,  defined  as  absolute  neutrophil  count  >500/mm3  for  3  consecutive  days  or 
>2000/mm3 for 1 day, occurred in 97.3% of all subjects (165 subjects [97.6%] in the vedolizumab IV 
group and 160 subjects [97.0%] in the placebo group) (Table 15.3.2.9). Overall, 5 subjects (1.5%) did 
not recover (2 in the vedolizumab IV group and 3 in the placebo group), and 3 subjects (0.9%) were 
not applicable for analysis. The overall mean (SD) number of days to engraftment was 16.8 (4.6) days, 
which was similar between treatment groups (17.1 [4.58] days for the vedolizumab IV group and 16.5 
[4.60] days for the placebo group). 
Platelet  engraftment,  defined  as  a  platelet  count  >20,000  cells/mm3  without  transfusion,  occurred  in 
91.9% of all subjects (159 subjects [94.1%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 148 subjects [89.7%] in 
the placebo group). Four and 12 subjects did not recover in the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups, 
respectively,  and  4  subjects  from  each  treatment  group  were  not  applicable  for  analysis.  The  overall 
mean  (SD)  number  of  days  to  platelet  recovery  was  21.4  (20.02)  days,  which  was  similar  between 
treatment  groups  (22.0  [17.51]  days  for  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  20.9  [22.41]  days  for  the 
placebo  group).  Additionally,  markedly  abnormal  platelets  (109/L)  were  similar  between  treatment 
groups  throughout  the  study;  a  total  of  158  subjects  (93.5%)  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  155 
subjects (93.9%) had low platelet values during the study, with the majority of subjects reporting low 
values at the Day +1 (76.0% overall) and Day +20 (61.% overall) visits. 
Vital Signs 
Overall,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  for  vital  signs  were 
observed

Pregnancy 
No pregnancies were reported during this study. 
Immunogenicity 
A summary of AVA status is presented in Table 11.w. 
The overall positive AVA rate in subjects who were treated with vedolizumab via IV infusion was 2.4% 
(4  of  168  subjects).  In  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  only  1  of  the  168  AVA  positive  subjects  was 
persistently positive (0.6%), and 2 of the 168 subjects developed neutralizing antibodies (1.2%). 
PK  Related  to  AVA  Status  The  development  of  persistent  AVA  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in 
vedolizumab serum trough concentrations. 
Safety Related to AVA Status There was no relationship between AVA status and investigator defined 
infusion-related eactions. 
Efficacy Related to AVA Status 
There was no relationship between AVA-positive status and efficacy of vedolizumab IV. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study  Vedolizumab-3035  was  included  in  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  EMEA-000645-PIP03-18. 
The age entry criteria for this study included subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg at the time 
of randomization.  
Enrollment 
was 
terminated 
early 
(343 
subjects 
had 
been 
enrolled 
(of 
the  estimated  target  558  subjects)  with  a  total  of  71  primary  endpoint  events  accrued  (of  the 
anticipated  148  events),  and  the  study  completed  on  09  May  2022,  primarily  due  to  low  subject 
recruitment  and  enrollment  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (since  February  2020).  The  decision  was 
influenced  by  multiple  factors,  none  of  which  were  related  to  safety  concerns  regarding  the  use  of 
vedolizumab in this patient population. All enrolled subjects were allowed to complete the study as per 
the protocol.  
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 50/57 
 
 
 
 
 
The  reduced  number  of  enrolled  patients  has  affected  the  strength  and  reproducibility  of  the  results, 
especially  for  subgroup  analyses.  Moreover,  the  absence  (only  1  subject  in  the  Placebo  arm)  of 
paediatric population did not allow to make any conclusion for the paediatric setting.  
The  MAH  decided to  discontinue  development  of  vedolizumab  for  use  in  this condition, in  both  adults 
and paediatrics. 
Study design This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab when addd to a background aGvHD prophylaxis 
regimen for intestinal aGvHD in subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. The subject population consisted of 
subjects with hematologic malignancies or myeloproliferative disorders for whom allo-HSCT from an 
unrelated donor was planned, using either peripheral blood or bone marrow as the stem cell source. 
The study consisted of a 30-day screening period, 155-day treatment period, a visit on Day +180 after 
allo-HSCT, and a posttreatment follow-up period for safety assessments and survival that were 
completed by 12 months after allo-HSCT. The study design is considered appropriate.  
Randomization followed a 1:1 fashion to 2 treatment and was stratified by age (≥18 years or 
adolescents aged 12 to <18 years), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match or mismatch (8/8 or 7/8), 
conditioning regimen (myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning), and treatment with or without 
ATG (ATG-F or thymoglobulin).  
Subjects were enrolled in 25 countries worldwide (19 sites in North America, 45 in Europe/Israel, 24 in 
Asia/Australia, and 7 in South America),  with a good representation of EU sites. 
Dose The vedolizumab dose and regimen in this phase 3 study was 300 mg on Day -1 before allo-
HSCT and Days +13, +41, +69, +97, +125, and +153 after allo-HSCT. The end-of-treatment visit was 
conducted on Day +180 after allo-HSCT. The selected dose was based on as based on results from 
Study Vedolizumab-1015: a phase 1b study that enrolled 24 subjects aged ≥18 years, demonstrated 
the safety and tolerability of adding vedolizumab on Day -1 (before allo-HSCT) and then on Days +13 
and +42 after allo-HSCT to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen (TAC + MTX) in subjects 
undergoing allo-HSCT. The duration of vedolizumab prophylaxis in this study design was intended to 
provide coverage during the posttransplant period, when subjects are at risk of developing classic and 
late aGvHD.  
The same vedolizumab dose regimen administered to adults (aged ≥18 years) who underwent allo-
HSCT for prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD was considered appropriate for administration to adolescents 
aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg.  
Supportive data on the use of the same dose of adults in adolescents  are from: i) the phase 3 studies 
in adults with IBD, body weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg, there was no difference in the safety 
profile in adults receiving vedolizumab IV every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks; ii) a population PK model in 
adults with UC or CD indicated that weight-based dosing is not required and that age is not a clinically 
meaningful covariate.  
Background GvHD prophylaxis consisting of a combination of CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF, ATG 
(ATG-F or thymoglobulin) was permissible in prophylaxis therapy per institutional practice is 
acceptable. 
Study population  
A  substantial  protocol  amendment  7  (Dated  18  September  2019)  was  made  to  open  enrollment  to 
adolescent subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥30 kg.  
EMA/3254/2023

The  selection  criteria  of  the  study  resulted  appropriate  and  included  patients  with  a  high  risk  of 
development of intestinal aGVHD, related to poor outcomes, mortality. The inclusion criteria respected 
the common standard clinical practice in stem cell transplantation; similarly, the allowed medical care 
for  prophylaxis  of  aGVHD  is  in line  with  current  international  guidelines.  In  the  exclusion  criteria,  the 
most  important  causes  of  infections  that  could  mimic  intestinal  aGVHD  were  excluded  (CMV  and 
Clostridium Difficile infection), ensuring a reduction   of interpretation bias.  
Notably,  the  underlying  primary  haematologic  diseases  included  in  this  trial  are  more  frequent  in  the 
adult  setting  than  in  the  paediatric  one  (except  for  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  or  some  types  of 
lymphomas). 
A sample size of 279 subjects per group (558 subjects total) was expected to generate 148 events for 
the  intestinal  aGvHD-free  survival,  and  provide  90%  power  at  the  alpha  of  0.05  for  a  2-sided 
hypothesis  based  on  log-rank  test.  For  the  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  a  hierarchy  of  the 
statistical testing was established and testing of the additional efficacy endpoints were not multiplicity 
adjusted.  
Disposition  of  Subjects  A  total  of  343  subjects  were  randomized  to  study  drug.  187  (54.5%  of  total) 
completed 7 doses of IV study drug. The primary reasons for discontinuation from study drug were AEs 
(34.8% in the vedolizumab IV group, 25.9% in the placebo group), death (24.2% in the vedolizumab 
IV group, 23.5% in the placebo group) unsatisfactory therapeutic response (lack of efficacy) (16.7% in 
the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  27.2%  in  the  placebo  group),  and  withdrawal  by  subjects  (12.1%  in  the 
vedolizumab IV group, 11.1% in the placebo group). 
A  total  of  282  subjects  (82.2%)  completed  the  Day  +180  visit  (ie,  through  the  end  of  the  treatment 
period).  The  majority  of  subjects  who  discontinued  study  drug  (42.9%)  also  discontinued  the  study. 
The  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  the  study  and  of  drug  treatment  were  similar  for  each  treatment 
group.  
Seventy-six  subjects  from  each  treatment  group  had  at  least  1  significant  protocol  deviation  (152 
subjects overall [44.3%]); the most common significant protocol deviations, not related to the COVID-
19  pandemic,  were  related  to  procedures  not  performed  per  protocol,  which  occurred  in  91  subjects 
overall (26.5%) similarly distributed between vedolizumab and placebo groups. 
Reasons  for  significant  protocol  deviation  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  included  procedures 
not per protocol (10 subjects, 2.9%), a missed visit (5 subjects, 1.5%), informed consent (3 subjects, 
0.9%),  and  study  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (1  subject,  0.3%).  The  overall  number  of  significant 
deviations appear high potentially impacting the quality of the study.  
Overall,  demographic  data  were  well  balanced  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo 
group;  with  the  exception  of  gender,  (more  male  than  female  subjects,  62.8%  vs  37.2%),  and 
ethnicity (majority of subjects were white,70.6%, and non-Hispanic or Latino, 79.9%). Regarding. 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics  
Demographic  data  resulted  well  balanced  between  the  vedolizumab  and  the  placebo  group,  with  the 
exception of gender and ethnicity. It is important to highlight that gender is not recognized, per se, as 
a  risk  factor  for  aGVHD,  but  the  specific  gender  discrepancy  between  female  donor-male  recipient  is 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  GVHD.  Overall,  this  specific  population  (female  donor/male 
recipient)  has  been  well  balanced between the two treatment  arms,  so that  gender discrepancy  does 
not affect the results.     
Regarding  the  prevalence  of  the  Caucasian  ethnicity,  this  datum  could  be  a  consequence  of  the 
ethnicity bias associated with the search of matched stem cell donor: it is widely known that patients 
of Caucasian ethnicities have a higher probability of matching a suitable donor as a direct consequence 
of the higher number of Caucasian donors in the IBMDR registry.

The median age, it was of 55.0 years overall (16-74), with only one patient aged < 18 years enrolled 
in the placebo group: this limitation did not allow to perform any evaluation about the possible role of 
vedolizumab  in  the  adolescent  setting.  All  the  other  age  group  were  well  represented  and  balanced 
between the two treatments groups. 
Overall, there were a good balance of the possible risk factors for the development of intestinal aGVHD 
(HLA  match  7/8,  Myeloablative  Conditioning,  absence  of  ATG  prophylaxis)  between  vedolizumab  and 
placebo groups, as well as for the main risk factors  for disease relapse (adverse cytogenetic, disease 
status at ASCT). 
The medication history, the concomitant medications, and the frequency of choice of stem cell source 
were in line with the common medical practice. Regarding the use of ATG in prophylaxis, its use was 
well balanced between the two groups, although the total number of subjects receiving ATG was higher 
in  respect  to  what  defined  at  baseline.  It  reasonable  to  assume  that  this  datum  could  not  have 
influenced the results between the two treatment arms.  
Efficacy data 
The primary endpoint (intestinal aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT) showed a 
statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group in intestinal 
aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 after allo-HSCT (p <0.001). The risk of an intestinal aGvHD event or 
death in subjects was 55% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 
0.45; 95% CI of HR, 0.27-0.73). In the vedolizumab IV group, there were 24 subjects (14.3%) with an 
observed event of intestinal aGvHD or death (any cause), whichever occurred first, by Day +180 after 
allo-HSCT; in the placebo group, there were 47 subjects (28.5%) with an observed event. Of those 
subjects, 12 (7.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 31 (28.8%) from the placebo group had an 
intestinal aGvHD event, and 12 subjects (7.1%) from the vedolizumab IV group and 16 subjects 
(9.7%) from the placebo group died. 
A consistent figure is shown by day +365 (exploratory endpoint, nominal p = 0.0041; HR, 0.53 [95% 
CI of HR, 0.35-0.81]). 
A a statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group is 
shown by the first key secondary endpoint (intestinal aGvHD-free and relapse-free, of the underlying  
malignancy, survival by day +180) (p = 0.0043). The risk of an event in subjects was 44% less in the 
vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.56; 95% CI of HR, 0.37-0.86).  
At Day +365 the HR was 0.78 [95% CI of HR, 0.54-1.12]), nominal p = 0.1676. 
Grade C-D aGvHD-free survival by Day +180 was 41% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared 
with the placebo group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI of HR, 0.39-0.91). Similar results obtained by Day +365.  
A positive trend in favour of vedolizumab was shown for the Grade B-D aGvHD-free survival, all by 
Day +180 although per the fixed-sequence hierarchical testing this endpoint was not tested. The 
nominal p-value was 0.0105.  The risk of a Grade B-D aGvHD event or death, whichever occurred first, 
was 36% less in the vedolizumab IV group compared with the placebo group (HR, 0.64; 95% CI of HR, 
0.46-0.91). 
Analyzing other key secondary endpoints related to survival (Nor Relapse Mortality by Day +180 
and Overall Survival by day +180) no statistically significant difference between the vedolizumab 
IV group and the placebo group were observed:  for the endpoint of NRM by Day +180 (p = 0.0668; 
HR, 0.48; 95% CI of HR, 0.22-1.04); for Day +180 overall survival nominal p-value 0.1458). Similar 
results have been obtained by day +365.

Therefore, a statistic significance was reached favouring vedolizumab over the placebo group in terms 
of intestinal aGVHD free survival and relapse free survival, which was maintained through Day +365.  
Consistent results were observed for the sensitivity and subgroup analyses, although the reduced size 
impairs  the  strength  of  results.      From  these  results  seem  that  the  favourable  outcome  with 
vedolizumab  over  placebo  was  not  affected  by  ATG  treatment;  moreover,  Vedolizumab  effect  in 
intestinal aGVHD prevention seemed clearer in a specific setting of patients with lower risk of aGVHD 
development  (patients  treated  with  RIC  regimen  instead  of  MAC  and  full  8/8  instead  of  7/8  HLA 
match). 
The benefit observed for the key primary and for the secondary efficacy endpoints of  combined 
aGVHD/relapse free survival  with vedolizumab at Day +180 was maintained through Day +365 and 
was more apparent with regard to aGvHD (intestinal or any organ involvement) than death (NRM and 
OS); this finding was consistent regardless of the assessment used for GvHD staging and grading (eg, 
clinical stage criteria, IBMTR severity index, MAGIC criteria) and probably it could be explained by the 
specific intestinal target of the drug.  
For subjects with GvHD requiring immunosuppression, the mean number of days that 
immunosuppression was required was numerically less in the vedolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group through Day +180 but the effect was lost through Day +365, suggesting a time limited 
effect in reducing the need of immunosuppression. 
SAFETY 
Safety analysis was performed using the SAF with the actual treatment received. The mean duration of 
exposure  was  similar  between  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  the  placebo  group  (241.7  and  230.0 
days, respectively).  
The mean number of doses received was also similar between treatment groups (5.4 doses [SD, 2.05] 
for the vedolizumab IV group and 5.1 doses [SD, 2.25] for the placebo group). Most subjects received 
7  doses  of  study  drug  per  protocol  (52.7%  of  subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  50.9%  of 
subjects in the placebo group). 
All  subjects  (100.0%;  334  of  334  subjects)  reported  at  least  1  TEAE,  with  a  total  of  8323  TEAEs 
overall: 4287 events in the vedolizumab IV group and 4036 events in the placebo group. 
92.3% (156 of 169) of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and 89.1% (147 of 165) of subjects in the 
placebo group had a Grade 3 or higher TEAE. 
TEAEs were serious (120 subjects [71.0%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 114 subjects [69.1%] in 
the  placebo  group),  and  79  serious  TEAEs  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  (39  subjects  [23.1%]  in 
the 
vedolizumab IV group and 38 subjects [23.0%] in the placebo group).  
Forty-eight subjects (14.4% of total) died due to a TEAE during the study; 21 subjects (12.4%) in the 
vedolizumab IV group and 27 subjects (16.4%) in the placebo group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs,  by  PT,  were  diarrhoea  (57.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group, 
63.0%  in  the  placebo  group),  stomatitis  (54.4%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  56.4%  in  the  placebo 
group), nausea (50.9% each in both treatment groups), pyrexia (49.1% in the vedolizumab IV group, 
41.8%  in  the  placebo  group),  anaemia  (40.2%  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group,  45.5%  in  the  placebo 
group),

Study  Drug-Related  TEAEs  Overall,  26.6%  (89  of  334)  of  subjects  had  a  TEAE  considered  by  the 
investigator to be related to study drug (48 of 169 subjects [28.4%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 
41 of 165 subjects [24.8%] in the placebo group) (Table 12.c). Study drug-related TEAEs were similar 
between the vedolizumab IV and placebo groups. infections and infestations (6.5% in the vedolizumab 
IV group, 3.6% in the placebo group). 
Deaths A total of 65 subjects (19.5% of the SAF) who participated in this study died.  
A total of 48 subjects had a TEAE resulting in death (21 subjects [12.4%] in the vedolizumab IV group 
and 27 subjects [16.4%] in the placebo group). 
AESI 
– Serious infections a numerically higher incidence in the vedolizumab IV group (125 subjects 
[74.0%]) compared with the placebo group (111 subjects [67.3%]) was reported. The most commonly 
reported treatment-emergent serious infections, by PT, were CMV infection reactivation (23.7% in the 
vedolizumab IV group, 18.2% in the placebo group). 
– PML A total of 3 subjects (1.8%) in the vedolizumab IV group and 2 subjects (1.2%) in the placebo 
group were listed as having “PML” in the clinical trial database. An additional subject was confirmed as 
having PML. the SAE of PML, with a fatal outcome. The investigator and the IAC deemed that the event 
of PML was due to acute GvHD and “heavy” immunosuppression treatment that was unrelated to 
vedolizumab IV. 
–  Malignancy  A  total  of  71  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy  were  reported  for  55  subjects 
(16.5%)  overall  (29  subjects  [17.2%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  26  subjects  [15.8%]  in  the 
placebo  group).  Treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy  were  similar  between  the  vedolizumab  IV 
group and the placebo group and consistent with a population of subjects undergoing allo-HSCT. The 
most  common  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  malignancy,  by  PT,  were  acute  myeloid  leukaemia 
recurrent (5.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 5.5% in the placebo group) 
– Liver injury A total of 292 treatment-emergent AESIs of liver injury were reported for 137 subjects 
(41.0%)  overall  (68  subjects  [40.2%]  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  group  and  69  subjects  [41.8%]  in  the 
placebo  group).    The  most  common  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  liver  injury,  by  PT,  were  alanine 
aminotransferase increased (24.9% in the vedolizumab IV group, 17.6% in the placebo group). 
– Hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and IRRs of AEs. A total of 618 treatment-emergent AESIs 
of hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs and injection site reactions were reported for 270 subjects 
(80.8%) overall (134 subjects [79.3%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 136 subjects [82.4%] in the 
placebo  group).  The  most  common  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  including 
IRRs and injection site reactions, by PT, were stomatitis (54.4% in the vedolizumab IV group, 56.4% in 
the placebo group). 
– Leukopenia or lymphopenia. A total of 26 treatment-emergent AESIs of leukopenia and lymphopenia 
were reported for 21 subjects (6.3%) overall, which is consistent with the patient population (subjects 
undergoing  allo-HSCT  and  taking  concomitant  immunosuppressants).  There  were  14  subjects  (8.3%) 
in the vedolizumab IV group and 7 subjects (4.2%) in the placebo group with an AESI of leukopenia or 
lymphopenia.  ,  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  was  observed  between  treatment  groups  given  the 
small number of subjects with at least 1 event of leukopenia or lymphopenia. 
– CMV colitis. CMV colitis: 0.6% of subjects in the vedolizumab IV group and the placebo group each 
had an AESI of CMV colitis. 
EMA/3254/2023  
Page 55/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– CMV reactivation. A total of 115 treatment-emergent AESIs of CMV reactivation were reported for 83 
subjects (24.9%) overall (45 subjects [26.6%] in the vedolizumab IV group and 38 subjects [23.0%] 
in  the  placebo  group)  (Table  12.h).  Although  treatment-emergent  AESIs  of  CMV  reactivation  were 
reported  in  a  numerically  higher  number  of  subjects  in  vedolizumab  IV  group  compared  with  the 
placebo group, there was no clinically meaningful difference. 
Laboratory findings similar trends between treatment groups in serum chemistry, hematology, vital 
signs, or physical examination findings were reported.  
In conclusion, the observed safety profile was comparable between treatment groups no meaningful 
differences have been identified. A specific evaluation of the paediatric subset could not be made.  
Overall, vedolizumab IV at a dose of 300 mg was well tolerated when added to standard GvHD 
prophylaxis (tacrolimus plus short-term methotrexate) in patients undergoing allo-HSCT. No new 
safety signals were identified. The safety profile reported for the indication should account for the 
known risk of undergoing allo-HSCT and taking concomitant immunosuppressants. with the known risk 
in the patient population undergoing allo-HSCT and taking concomitant immunosuppressants.

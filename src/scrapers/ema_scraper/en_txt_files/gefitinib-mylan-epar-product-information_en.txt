4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Gefitinib Mylan is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK 
(see section 4.4). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Gefitinib Mylan should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the 
use of anticancer therapies. 
Posology 
The recommended posology of Gefitinib Mylan is one 250 mg tablet once a day. If a dose is missed, it 
should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is less than 12 hours to the next dose, the 
patient should not take the missed dose. Patients should not take a double dose (two doses at the same 
time) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers 
No specific dose adjustment is recommended in patients with known CYP2D6 poor metaboliser 
genotype, but these patients should be closely monitored for adverse events (see section 5.2). 
Dose adjustment due to toxicity 
Patients with poorly tolerated diarrhoea or skin adverse reactions may be successfully managed by 
providing a brief (up to 14 days) therapy interruption followed by reinstatement of the 250 mg dose 
(see section 4.8). For patients unable to tolerate treatment after a therapy interruption, gefitinib should 
be discontinued and an alternative treatment should be considered.

The safety and efficacy of Gefitinib Mylan in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not 
been established. There is no relevant use of gefitinib in the paediatric population in the indication of 
NSCLC. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) due to cirrhosis have 
increased plasma concentrations of gefitinib. These patients should be closely monitored for adverse 
events. Plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with elevated aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin due to liver metastases (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function at creatinine clearance 
> 20 ml/min. Only limited data are available in patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 20 ml/min and 
caution is advised in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration  
Gefitinib Mylan is for oral use. The tablet may be taken with or without food, at about the same time 
each day.  
The tablet can be swallowed whole with some water or if dosing of whole tablets is not possible, 
tablets may be administered as a dispersion in water (non-carbonated). No other liquids should be 
used.  
Without crushing it, the tablet should be dropped in half a glass of drinking water. The glass should be 
swirled occasionally, until the tablet is dispersed (this may take up to 20 minutes). The dispersion 
should be drunk immediately after dispersion is complete (i.e. within 60 minutes). The glass should be 
rinsed with half a glass of water, which should also be drunk. The dispersion can also be administered 
through a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When considering the use of Gefitinib Mylan as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC, it is important that EGFR mutation assessment of the tumour tissue is attempted for all 
patients. If a tumour sample is not evaluable, then circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) obtained from a 
blood (plasma) sample may be used. 
Only robust, reliable and sensitive test(s) with demonstrated utility for the determination of EGFR 
mutation status of tumours or ctDNA should be used to avoid false negative or false positive 
determinations (see section 5.1). 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) which may be acute in onset, has been observed in 1.3% of patients 
receiving gefitinib, and some cases have been fatal (see section 4.8). If patients experience worsening 
of respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, Gefitinib Mylan should be interrupted 
and the patient should be promptly investigated. If ILD is confirmed, Gefitinib Mylan should be 
discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 
In a Japanese pharmacoepidemiological case control study in 3 159 patients with NSCLC receiving 
gefitinib or chemotherapy who were followed up for 12 weeks, the following risk factors for 
developing ILD (irrespective of whether the patient received gefitinib or chemotherapy) were 
identified: smoking, poor performance status (PS≥ 2), CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung 
(≤ 50%), recent diagnosis of NSCLC (< 6 months), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 55 years old) and 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concurrent cardiac disease. An increased risk of ILD on gefitinib relative to chemotherapy was seen 
predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment (adjusted OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.9 to 7.7); thereafter 
the relative risk was lower (adjusted OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 5.8). Risk of mortality among patients who 
developed ILD on gefitinib or chemotherapy was higher in patients with the following risk factors: 
smoking, CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung (≤ 50%), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 65 years 
old), and extensive areas adherent to pleura (≥ 50%). 
Hepatotoxicity and liver impairment 
Liver function test abnormalities (including increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, bilirubin) have been observed, uncommonly presenting as hepatitis (see section 4.8). 
There have been isolated reports of hepatic failure which in some cases led to fatal outcomes. 
Therefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. Gefitinib should be used cautiously in the 
presence of mild to moderate changes in liver function. Discontinuation should be considered if 
changes are severe. 
Impaired liver function due to cirrhosis has been shown to lead to increased plasma concentrations of 
gefitinib (see section 5.2). 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 inducers may increase metabolism of gefitinib and decrease gefitinib plasma concentrations. 
Therefore, concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
rifampicin, barbiturates or herbal preparations containing St John’s wort/Hypericum perforatum) may 
reduce efficacy of the treatment and should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
In individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype, treatment with a potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor might lead to increased plasma levels of gefitinib. At initiation of treatment with a CYP3A4 
inhibitor, patients should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions (see section 4.5). 
International normalised ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some 
patients taking warfarin together with gefitinib (see section 4.5). Patients taking warfarin and gefitinib 
concomitantly should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time (PT) or INR. 
Medicinal products that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH, such as proton-pump 
inhibitors and h2-antagonists may reduce bioavailability and plasma concentrations of gefitinib and, 
therefore, may reduce efficacy. Antacids if taken regularly close in time to administration of gefitinib 
may have a similar effect (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Data from phase II clinical studies, where gefitinib and vinorelbine have been used concomitantly, 
indicate that gefitinib may exacerbate the neutropenic effect of vinorelbine. 
Lactose  
Gefitinib Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Further precautions for use 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if they experience severe or persistent 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or anorexia as these may indirectly lead to dehydration. These symptoms 
should be managed as clinically indicated (see section 4.8). 
Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or worsening: eye 
inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred 
promptly to an ophthalmology specialist. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with gefitinib should be interrupted, and if 
symptoms do not resolve, or if symptoms recur on reintroduction of gefitinib, permanent 
discontinuation should be considered. 
In a phase I/II study the use of gefitinib and radiation in paediatric patients, with newly diagnosed 
brain stem glioma or incompletely resected supratentorial malignant glioma, 4 cases (1 fatal) of 
Central Nervous System (CNS) haemorrhages were reported from 45 patients enrolled. A further case 
of CNS haemorrhage has been reported in a child with an ependymoma from a study with gefitinib 
alone. An increased risk of cerebral haemorrhage in adult patients with NSCLC receiving gefitinib has 
not been established. 
Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients taking gefitinib. In most cases this is 
associated with other known risk factors, including concomitant medicinal products such as steroids or 
NSAIDS, underlying history of GI ulceration, age, smoking or bowel metastases at sites of 
perforation. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The metabolism of gefitinib is via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 (predominantly) and via 
CYP2D6. 
Active substances that may increase gefitinib plasma concentrations 
In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib is a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Available data do not 
suggest any clinical consequences to this in vitro finding. 
Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the clearance of gefitinib. Concomitant administration 
with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, protease 
inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin) may increase gefitinib plasma concentrations. The increase 
may be clinically relevant since adverse reactions are related to dose and exposure. The increase might 
be higher in individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype. Pre-treatment with 
itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an 80% increase in the mean AUC of gefitinib in 
healthy volunteers. In situations of concomitant treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 the 
patient should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions. 
There are no data on concomitant treatment with an inhibitor of CYP2D6 but potent inhibitors of this 
enzyme might cause increased plasma concentrations of gefitinib in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers 
by about 2-fold (see section 5.2). If concomitant treatment with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor is initiated, 
the patient should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
Active substances that may reduce gefitinib plasma concentrations 
Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may increase metabolism and decrease gefitinib 
plasma concentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of gefitinib. Concomitant medicinal products 
that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates or St John’s wort, 
Hypericum perforatum) should be avoided. Pre-treatment with rifampicin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer) 
in healthy volunteers reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 83% (see section 4.4). 
Substances that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH may reduce gefitinib plasma 
concentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of gefitinib. High doses of short-acting antacids may 
have a similar effect if taken regularly close in time to administration of gefitinib. Concomitant 
administration of gefitinib with ranitidine at a dose that caused sustained elevations in gastric pH ≥ 5 
resulted in a reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 47% in healthy volunteers (see section 4.4 and 5.2). 
Active substances that may have their plasma concentrations altered by gefitinib 
In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit CYP2D6. In a clinical study 
in patients, gefitinib was co-administered with metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate). This resulted in a 
35% increase in exposure to metoprolol. Such an increase might potentially be relevant for CYP2D6 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index. When the use of CYP2D6 substrates are considered in 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combination with gefitinib, a dose modification of the CYP2D6 substrate should be considered 
especially for products with a narrow therapeutic window. 
Gefitinib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding is 
unknown. 
Other potential interactions 
INR elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients concomitantly taking 
warfarin (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised not to get pregnant during therapy. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of gefitinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Gefitinib Mylan 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether gefitinib is secreted in human milk. Gefitinib and metabolites of gefitinib 
accumulated in milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Gefitinib is contraindicated during 
breast-feeding and therefore breast-feeding must be discontinued while receiving gefitinib therapy (see 
section 4.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
During treatment with gefitinib, asthenia has been reported. Therefore, patients who experience this 
symptom should be cautious when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the pooled dataset from the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical studies (2 462 
gefitinib-treated patients), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs), occurring in 
more than 20% of the patients, are diarrhoea and skin reactions (including rash, acne, dry skin and 
pruritus). ADRs usually occur within the first month of therapy and are generally reversible. 
Approximately 8% of patients had a severe ADR (common toxicity criteria, (CTC) grade 3 or 4). 
Approximately 3% of patients stopped therapy due to an ADR. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has occurred in 1.3% of patients, often severe (CTC grade 3-4). Cases 
with fatal outcomes have been reported. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile presented in Table 1 is based on the gefitinib clinical development programme and 
post-marketed experience. Adverse reactions have been assigned to the frequency categories in Table 
1 where possible based on the incidence of comparable adverse reactions reports in a pooled dataset 
from the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical studies (2 462 gefitinib-treated patients). 
Frequencies of occurrence of undesirable effects are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare 
(< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
In the INTEREST study, the incidence of ILD type events was 1.4% (10) patients in the gefitinib 
group versus 1.1% (8) patients in the docetaxel group. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred 
in a patient receiving gefitinib. 
In the ISEL study, the incidence of ILD-type events in the overall population was approximately 1% 
in both treatment arms. The majority of ILD-type events reported was from patients of Asian ethnicity 
and the ILD incidence among patients of Asian ethnicity receiving gefitinib therapy and placebo was 
approximately 3% and 4% respectively. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a patient 
receiving placebo. 
In a post-marketing surveillance study in Japan (3 350 patients) the reported rate of ILD-type events in 
patients receiving gefitinib was 5.8%. The proportion of ILD-type events with a fatal outcome was 
38.6%. 
In a phase III open-label clinical study (IPASS) in 1 217 patients comparing gefitinib to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment in selected patients with advanced 
NSCLC in Asia, the incidence of ILD-type events was 2.6% on the gefitinib treatment arm versus 
1.4% on the carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment arm. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose of gefitinib. However, in phase I clinical 
studies, a limited number of patients were treated with daily doses of up to 1 000 mg. An increase of 
frequency and severity of some adverse reactions was observed, mainly diarrhoea and skin rash. 
Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically; in particular severe 
diarrhoea should be managed as clinically indicated. In one study a limited number of patients were 
treated weekly with doses from 1 500 mg to 3 500 mg. In this study gefitinib exposure did not increase 
with increasing dose, adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and were consistent 
with the known safety profile of gefitinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01EB01 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR [HER1; ErbB1]) have been identified as 
key drivers in the process of cell growth and proliferation for normal and cancer cells. EGFR 
activating mutation within a cancer cell is an important factor in promotion of tumour cell growth, 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blocking of apoptosis, increasing the production of angiogenic factors and facilitating the processes of 
metastasis. 
Gefitinib is a selective small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
kinase and is an effective treatment for patients with tumours with activating mutations of the EGFR 
tyrosine kinase domain regardless of line of therapy. No clinically relevant activity has been shown in 
patients with known EGFR mutation-negative tumours. 
The common EGFR activating mutations (Exon 19 deletions; L858R) have robust response data 
supporting sensitivity to gefitinib; for example a progression free survival HR (95% CI) of 
0.489 (0.336, 0.710) for gefitinib vs. doublet chemotherapy [WJTOG3405]. Gefitinib response data is 
more sparse in patients whose tumours contain the less common mutations; the available data indicates 
that G719X, L861Q and S7681 are sensitising mutations; and T790M alone or exon 20 insertions 
alone are resistance mechanisms. 
Resistance 
Most NSCLC tumours with sensitising EGFR kinase mutations eventually develop resistance to 
gefitinib treatment, with a median time to disease progression of 1 year. In about 60% of cases, 
resistance is associated with a secondary T790M mutation for which T790M targeted EGFR TKIs may 
be considered as a next line treatment option. Other potential mechanisms of resistance that have been 
reported following treatment with EGFR signal blocking agents include: bypass signalling such as 
HER2 and MET gene amplification and PIK3CA mutations. Phenotypic switch to small cell lung 
cancer has also been reported in 5-10% of cases. 
Circulating Tumour DNA (ctDNA) 
In the IFUM study, mutation status was assessed in tumour and ctDNA samples derived from plasma, 
using the Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Both ctDNA and tumour samples were 
evaluable for 652 patients out of 1 060 screened. The objective response rate (ORR) in those patients 
who were tumour and ctDNA mutation positive was 77% (95% CI: 66% to 86%) and in those who 
were tumour only mutation positive 60% (95% CI: 44% to 74%).

These data are consistent with the pre-planned exploratory Japanese subgroup analysis in IPASS 
(Goto 2012). In that study ctDNA derived from serum, not plasma was used for EGFR mutation 
analysis using the EGFR Mutation Test Kit (DxS) (N= 86). In that study, sensitivity was 43.1%, 
specificity was 100%. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
First line treatment 
The randomised phase III first line IPASS study was conducted in patients in Asia1 with advanced 
(stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology who were ex-light smokers (ceased smoking 
≥ 15 years ago and smoked ≤ 10 pack years) or never smokers (see Table 3).

of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. 
Pre-treated patients 
The randomised phase III INTEREST study was conducted in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC who had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy. In the overall 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
population, no statistically significant difference between gefitinib and docetaxel (75 mg/m2) was 
observed for overall survival, progression free survival and objective response rates (see Table 5).

The randomised phase III ISEL study was conducted in patients with advanced NSCLC who had 
received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and were refractory or intolerant to their most recent 
regimen. Gefitinib plus best supportive care was compared to placebo plus best supportive care. 
Gefitinib did not prolong survival in the overall population. Survival outcomes differed by smoking 
status and ethnicity (see Table 6).

The IFUM study was a single-arm, multicentre study conducted in Caucasian patients (n=106) with 
activating, sensitizing EGFR mutation positive NSCLC to confirm that the activity of gefitinib is 
similar in Caucasian and Asian populations. The ORR according to investigator review was 70% and 
the median PFS was 9.7 months. These data are similar to those reported in the IPASS study. 
EGFR mutation status and clinical characteristics 
Clinical characteristics of never smoker, adenocarcinoma histology, and female gender have been 
shown to be independent predictors of positive EGFR mutation status in a multivariate analysis of 
786 Caucasian patients from gefitinib studies* (see Table 7). Asian patients also have a higher 
incidence of EGFR mutation-positive tumours.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of gefitinib, absorption is moderately slow and peak plasma 
concentrations of gefitinib typically occur at 3 to 7 hours after administration. Mean absolute 
bioavailability is 59% in cancer patients. Exposure to gefitinib is not significantly altered by food. In a 
study in healthy volunteers where gastric pH was maintained above pH 5, gefitinib exposure was 
reduced by 47%, likely due to impaired solubility of gefitinib in the stomach (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Distribution 
Gefitinib has a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 1 400 L indicating extensive distribution 
into tissue. Plasma protein binding is approximately 90%. Gefitinib binds to serum albumin and alpha 
1-acid glycoprotein. 
In vitro data indicate that gefitinib is a substrate for the membrane transport protein P-gp. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the major P450 isozyme involved in the oxidative 
metabolism of gefitinib. 
In vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit CYP2D6. Gefitinib shows no 
enzyme induction effects in animal studies and no significant inhibition (in vitro) of any other 
cytochrome P450 enzyme. 
Gefitinib is extensively metabolised in humans. Five metabolites have been fully identified in excreta 
and 8 metabolites in plasma. The major metabolite identified was O-desmethyl gefitinib, which is 
14-fold less potent than gefitinib at inhibiting EGFR stimulated cell growth and has no inhibitory 
effect on tumour cell growth in mice. It is therefore considered unlikely that it contributes to the 
clinical activity of gefitinib. 
The formation of O-desmethyl gefitinib has been shown, in vitro, to be via CYP2D6. The role of 
CYP2D6 in the metabolic clearance of gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical study in healthy 
volunteers genotyped for CYP2D6 status. In poor metabolisers no measurable levels of O-desmethyl 
gefitinib were produced. The levels of exposure to gefitinib achieved in both the extensive and the 
poor metaboliser groups were wide and overlapping but the mean exposure to gefitinib was 2-fold 
higher in the poor metaboliser group. The higher average exposures that could be achieved by 
individuals with no active CYP2D6 may be clinically relevant since adverse effects are related to dose 
and exposure. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Gefitinib is excreted mainly as metabolites via the faeces, with renal elimination of gefitinib and 
metabolites accounting for less than 4% of the administered dose. 
Gefitinib total plasma clearance is approximately 500 ml/min and the mean terminal half-life is 
41 hours in cancer patients. Administration of gefitinib once daily results in 2- to 8-fold accumulation, 
with steady state exposures achieved after 7 to 10 doses. At steady state, circulating plasma 
concentrations are typically maintained within a 2- to 3-fold range over the 24-hour dosing interval. 
Special populations 
From analyses of population pharmacokinetic data in cancer patients, no relationships were identified 
between predicted steady-state trough concentration and patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity or 
creatinine clearance (above 20 ml/min). 
Hepatic impairment 
In a phase I open-label study of single dose gefitinib 250 mg in patients with mild, moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis (according to Child-Pugh classification), there was an increase in 
exposure in all groups compared with healthy controls. An average 3.1-fold increase in exposure to 
gefitinib in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment was observed. None of the patients 
had cancer, all had cirrhosis and some had hepatitis. This increase in exposure may be of clinical 
relevance since adverse experiences are related to dose and exposure to gefitinib. 
Gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical study conducted in 41 patients with solid tumours and 
normal hepatic function, or moderate or severe hepatic impairment (classified according to baseline 
Common Toxicity Criteria grades for AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) due to liver metastases. 
It was shown that following daily administration of 250 mg gefitinib, time to steady-state, total plasma 
clearance (CmaxSS) and steady-state exposure (AUC24SS) were similar for the groups with normal and 
moderately impaired hepatic function. Data from 4 patients with severe hepatic impairment due to 
liver metastases suggested that steady-state exposures in these patients are also similar to those in 
patients with normal hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to the 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
-  
-  
-  
Corneal epithelia atrophy and corneal translucencies 
Renal papillary necrosis 
Hepatocellular necrosis and eosinophilic sinusoidal macrophage infiltration. 
Data from non-clinical (in vitro) studies indicate that gefitinib has the potential to inhibit the cardiac 
action potential repolarization process (e.g. QT interval). Clinical experience has not shown a causal 
association between QT prolongation and gefitinib. 
A reduction in female fertility was observed in the rat at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. 
Published studies have shown that genetically modified mice, lacking expression of EGFR, exhibit 
developmental defects, related to epithelial immaturity in a variety of organs including the skin, 
gastrointestinal tract and lung. When gefitinib was administered to rats during organogenesis, there 
were no effects on embryofoetal development at the highest dose (30 mg/kg/day). However, in the 
rabbit, there were reduced foetal weights at 20 mg/kg/day and above. There were no 
compound-induced malformations in either species. When administered to the rat throughout gestation 
and parturition, there was a reduction in pup survival at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day. 
Following oral administration of C-14 labelled gefitinib to lactating rats 14 days post-partum, 
concentrations of radioactivity in milk were 11-19 fold higher than in blood. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gefitinib showed no genotoxic potential. 
A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats resulted in a small but statistically significant increased 
incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in both male and female rats and mesenteric lymph node 
haemangiosarcomas in female rats at the highest dose (10 mg/kg/day) only. The hepatocellular 
adenomas were also seen in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, which demonstrated a small 
increased incidence of this finding in male mice at the mid dose, and in both male and female mice at 
the highest dose. The effects reached statistical significance for the female mice, but not for the males. 
At no-effect levels in both mice and rats there was no margin in clinical exposure. The clinical 
relevance of these findings is unknown. 
The results of an in vitro phototoxicity study demonstrated that gefitinib may have phototoxicity 
potential.

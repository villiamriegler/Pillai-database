1.  Executive Summary 
Nimenrix is a quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine composed of the capsular 
polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, each conjugated to tetanus 
toxoid.  
Nimenrix was authorised via the centralised procedure on 20th April 2012 for active immunisation of 
individuals from the age of 12 months and above against invasive meningococcal disease caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. A single dose is recommended in all age groups. 
The need for booster doses remains to be established but can be anticipated from the experience thus 
far with MenC conjugates. 
The MAH submitted the synoptic report for the paediatric study MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 Month 44 in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.  
The MAH has stated that, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Nimenrix. No urgent action is required 
regarding the SmPC. However, the MAH has planned to file a variation during 2013 in which data 
collected from a range of studies already submitted under Article 46 will be resubmitted to support 
changes to section 5.1 of the SmPC (i.e. to add antibody persistence data). 
2.  Recommendation 
No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. The assessor agrees that a single variation may be filed to add 
information derived from several antibody persistence studies. 
3.  Introduction 
MenACWY-TT-088 EXT081 M44 represents the follow-up to Year 4 of subjects who were initially 
enrolled into the primary study MenACWY-TT-081.  
The primary phase data from study MenACWY-TT-081 were submitted as part of the initial MAA for 
Nimenrix.  
Further follow-up of the subjects is planned up to 68 months after primary vaccination in MenACWY-
TT-081. 
4.  Scientific Discussion 
In the initial application dossier the data were presented as follows:

In the initial study 081 
The target sample size was 400 subjects who were to be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to ACWY-TT or 
Menjugate. Enrolment was stratified to provide approximately 200 subjects in each of the two age

strata of 2-5 and 6-10 years. The applicant concluded that this sample would provide power to meet 
the non-inferiority immunogenicity criterion of at least 85.6%.  
The study was conducted in 2008-9. All of the 414 subjects enrolled and vaccinated completed the 
initial phase and 310 completed the longer-term follow-up while 296 were included in the ATP-I cohort. 
The mean age was 5.6 years (3.5 and 7.8 years in the two age strata) with a balanced gender 
distribution. Almost all subjects were of European Caucasian descent.  
The applicant concluded that non-inferiority of ACWY-TT vs. Menjugate was demonstrated for 
responses to MenC based on a lower bound of the 95% CI that was -5.25%, with virtually no 
difference in response rates between vaccines for each subset according to baseline MenC serostatus.   
Response rates to ACWY-TT for each meningococcal group were higher in the subsets seronegative at 
baseline (99-100%) compared to those seropositive at baseline (89-98%). In the Menjugate group 
some subjects fulfilled the criteria for a vaccine response to MenA, W or Y. This was especially 
noticeable for rSBA against MenW and MenY among those seronegative to these meningococcal groups 
at baseline.

The supplementary tables of the response rates by age strata showed that in each case the responses 
to the MenC conjugates were comparable. In both age strata there were comparable responses to 
MenW and MenY in Menjugate subjects who were seronegative for these groups at baseline. However, 
responses to MenA, W and Y were all much higher in the ACWY-TT group regardless of baseline 
serostatus. 
As shown below: 
o  Baseline percentages with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 ranged from 43.4% (MenA in the Menjugate group) 
to 86.3% (MenY in the ACWY-TT group).  
o  The percentages with rSBA titres ≥ 1:128 increased to at least 99.3% after administration of 
ACWY-TT and all the Menjugate subjects had a MenC titre ≥ 1:128. 
o  The rSBA GMTs increased by 54-fold to 198-fold in the ACWY-TT group and the MenC GMT 
increased 273-fold in the Menjugate group vs. 123-fold in the ACWY-TT group. The rSBA-MenC 
GMT adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata was statistically significantly 
lower in the ACWY-TT group.

The post-vaccination percentages with rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 were comparable for the two age 
strata whereas the GMTs tended to be lower in the younger subjects compared to the older subjects. 
In each age stratum of subjects who received the ACWY-TT vaccine the rSBA GMT for MenC was lower 
than for the other three meningococcal groups.

Percentages of subjects with anti-PS concentrations ≥ 0.3 µg/mL before vaccination were low for each 
meningococcal group (from 3.4% to 23.1%). One month after vaccination anti-PS ≥ 2 µg/ml was 
observed in at least 86.8% in the ACWY-TT group and all subjects in the Menjugate group had ≥ 2 
µg/ml against MenC. GMCs increased from 41-fold to 162-fold after ACWY-TT and by 90-fold to MenC 
in Menjugate recipients compared to 83-fold in ACWY-TT recipients. No statistically significant 
difference was observed for GMCs adjusted for pre-vaccination measurements and age strata between 
the ACWY-TT group and the Menjugate group. 
Anti-tetanus antibody was not reported from this study.

Month 44 data from 088 
Of the 414 subjects enrolled in the initial study 081 there were 261 subjects who were followed up at 
the Month 44 persistence time-point, as shown below.  
The rSBA serological testing at pre-vaccination and one month post-vaccination in 081 were performed 
at GSK laboratories but the Month 32 and Month 44 samples were tested only at the Health Protection 
Agency (HPA) laboratories in the United Kingdom. For this reason, the M32 and M44 data have been 
presented in separate tables and the antibody kinetics and decay in plasma antibody levels between 
081 and 088 cannot be directly assessed. 
At Month 44 after primary vaccination the HPA rSBA data showed the following: 
o  The percentages with rSBA-MenA titres ≥1:8 were 85.7% in the ACWY-TT group and 25.8% in 
the MenCCRM group. 
o  The percentage with rSBA-MenC titres ≥1:8 were 37.0% in the ACWY-TT group and 45.5% in 
the MenCCRM group. 
o  The percentage with rSBA-MenW-135 titres ≥1:8 were 68.3% in the ACWY-TT group and 
10.6% in the MenCCRM group. 
o  The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenY titres ≥1:8 were 62.4% in the ACWY-TT group and 
6.1% in the MenCCRM group.

In contrast to the rSBA data, the hSBA data showed much lower antibody persistence against MenA 
(see initial assessment reports on this recognised discrepancy between the assays) but suggested 
better antibody persistence against the other meningococcal groups than indicated by the rSBA titres. 
Another anomaly of these data is the fact that in both vaccine groups the hSBA titres against MenA 
increased between M32 and M44 since no marked natural boosting effect would be expected.

This unexpected finding and the fact that the M44 titres are actually higher in the control group are 
shown in the RCD below.

No SAEs or deaths related to study participation or related to concurrent GSK drug and/or vaccine 
were reported from the end of the six-month Extended Safety Follow-up period following vaccination in 
study 081 until the Month 44 persistence time-point. 
5.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion and Recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Based on the HPA rSBA data, the M44 data indicate that > 60% of subjects who had received 
MenACWY-TT in study 081 retained at least rSBA titres 1:8 except for MenC, for which the rates were 
37% in the Nimenrix group and 45% in the Menjugate group. The highest persistence was observed 
against MenA. 
In this regard the hSBA not only show the expected anomaly vs. rSBA regarding persistence of anti-
MenA antibody but also show unexpected marked increments between M32 and M44 in both vaccine 
groups. This is a very strange finding for which there is no immediately obvious explanation for 
children resident within the EU. However, this is an issue that the MAH can address during the 
forthcoming variation. 
It is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the need for booster doses from these data.  
Recommendation  
The data should be added to the SmPC as already planned by the MAH in a forthcoming variation 
procedure.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Yondelis, the 
scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
Following the EU-RMP Version 7.0 update, drug-drug interactions was added as 
missing information. Additionally, based on the results of the 2 drug-drug interaction 
studies involving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers (ET743-OVC-1003 and ET743-
OVC-1002), the CCDS was updated and the MAH proposed to reflect these results in 
the product information accordingly. Cases involving drug-drug interactions will 
continue to be monitored in future PBRERs/PSURs, especially those involving CYP3A4 
and P-gp inhibition. Action taken with respect to drug-interactions is endorsed by the 
PRAC.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Yondelis, the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance 
TRABECTEDIN is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

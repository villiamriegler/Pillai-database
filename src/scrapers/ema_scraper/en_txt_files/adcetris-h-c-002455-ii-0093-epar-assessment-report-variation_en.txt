1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Takeda Pharma A/S submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 8 July 2021 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.6 of the SmPC based on results from study C25004, an 
open-label study in order to assess the safety and tolerability,  of brentuximab vedotin when combined 
with multiagent chemotherapy regimen for first-line treatment of advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma 
in paediatric patients. The RMP version 16 has also been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary  of Product Characteristics and to the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information  on paediatric  requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0013/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0013/2021 was completed. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In support of this variation, the final study results of the paediatric clinical study C25004 and of a 
meta-analysis including published studies in which paediatric patients were treated with brentuximab 
vedotin (BV), were submitted. The MAH is proposing to include a limited selection of these data in 
SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. The MAH is not seeking with this variation submission an 
extension of indication for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma in the paediatric population. 
Study C25004 
Study C25004 was an open-label, multicentre, phase 1/2 study of A+AVD in 59 paediatric patients 
with previously untreated Stage III or Stage IV cHL. Patient age at study entry ranged from 6 to 17 
years. The median age was 14 years. 
The study was the first to investigate body surface area (BSA)-based dosing of brentuximab vedotin in 
combination with adriamycin (doxorubicin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine (BV+AVD) combination in 
children. Patients (N=59) received 48 mg/m2 of BV administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 
minutes + doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) were analysed for overall response rate (ORR) per independent review facility (IRF) and other 
safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints. 
The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin (antibody-drug conjugate [ADC] and monomethyl 
auristatin E [MMAE]) in paediatric patients was evaluated C25004 by non-compartmental analysis 
using PK rich data. Integrated population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling of PK data from paediatric 
studies C25002 (BV monotherapy 1.8 mg/kg Q3W, procedure EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0049) and C25004

is performed to support the proposed dosing regimens and to compare exposure with exposure in adult 
patients. 
Study C25004 enrolled 59 patients, eleven patients (19%) were between 6 and 11 years, and 48 
patients (81%) were between 12 and 17 years.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Maximum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin were typically observed at the end of infusion or the 
sampling timepoint closest to the end of infusion. A multiexponential decline in ADC serum 
concentrations was observed with a terminal half-life of approximately  4 days. A 30% higher AUC 
exposure of ADC was observed with multiple doses at the every 2-week schedule, which is slightly 
higher than anticipated for a terminal half-life of 4 days. Typical Cmax and AUC of ADC after a single 
48 mg/m2 dose was approximately  23 μg/mL and 47 μg.day/mL, respectively. Mean Cmax and AUC of 
MMAE were 4.9 ng/mL, 27 ng.day/mL, respectively. MMAE exposures decreased after multiple doses of 
brentuximab vedotin with approximately  50% to 70% of the exposure of the first dose being observed 
at subsequent doses. 
ADC and MMAE exposures were comparable  for paediatric patients <12 and ≥12 years of age in study 
C25004, supporting the BSA-based dosing of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients treated with 
brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy. 
Based on non-compartmental PK across study comparison,  ADC and MMAE steady-state exposures 
were comparable  in paediatric patients from Study C25004 administered 48 mg/m2 Q2W in 
combination with chemotherapy AVD and in adult patients with advanced HL from Study C25003 
administered 1.2 mg/kg Q2W in combination with chemotherapy AVD. 
The popPK model for ADC and especially for MMAE shows overestimation of the variability, some bias 
for both paediatric studies, and while the objective function of the popPK  improved by inclusion of the 
co-variates, the unexplained variability  was not improved, and the co-variates had no significant effect. 
PopPK estimated an approximately  2-fold higher ADC clearance for patients on concurrent treatment 
with AVD. This is rather unexpected since non-compartmental analysis indicated only a 10-25% lower 
ADC exposure in paediatric patients with concurrent chemotherapy. In addition, in adults on 
concurrent treatment with AVD, pharmacokinetics of ADC was consistent with that of monotherapy. 
Therefore, the popPK  models of ADC and MMAE are considered suitable for descriptive purposes only, 
not for simulation purposes and consequently comparison with adult exposures and exposure-effect 
analysis by means of popPK simulations are considered exploratory only.  
Since there are sufficient pharmacokinetic data from the non-compartmental analysis to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE in paediatric patients from studies C25002 (brentuximab vedotin 
1.8 mg/kg Q3W) and C25004 (brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m2 Q2W in combination with 
chemotherapy) in the SmPC section 5.2, no questions regarding the popPK  model will be raised. A 
corrected Table with PK estimates of MMAE Cmax values was submitted as requested and the MAH is 
recommended for future applications to review the popPK model. The text in section 5.2 of the SmPC 
has been amended to report the pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE as determined by non-
compartmental analysis.  
Immunogenicity 
Four patients (7%) were ADA positive at some time point post-baseline of which 1 patients was 
already ADA positive at baseline. All 4 patients were transiently ADA positive with a low (≤25) ADA 
titre. Two of 59 patients (3%) were Nab positive. The low immunogenicity is line with previous 
observations. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has accordingly been updated.

Efficacy 
Results of the small, single arm  clinical study C25004 show high response rates with brentuximab 
vedotin in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed HL. CR rate was above 76%. The high response 
rate indicates significant anti-tumour activity. The median PFS, EFS and OS were not reached yet, 
which is due to the good prognosis of (paediatric) patients with HL. However,  the interpretation of the 
results of the time dependent endpoints is hampered due to the single arm study design of C25004. 
Additional long term follow up data is likely be obtained in the LTFU study of C25004.  
Results of the C25004 study were not contextualized with historical efficacy results obtained with other 
available treatment regimens for newly diagnosed paediatric HL patients. Also, the applicant stated 
that the study C25004 results (including response rates) for newly diagnosed paediatric HL patients 
treated with brentuximab-vedotin+AVD produced were comparable  to results in adults, while a 
thorough discussion on the concept of extrapolation of adult data to the paediatric population was not 
included. However,  as no indication for newly diagnosed paediatric HL is currently requested, the 
absence of contextualization and the extrapolation exercise is acceptable.  
Meta-analysis 
To support the efficacy of brentuximab-vedotin in paediatric patients with HL, results of a meta-
analysis were submitted. This meta-analysis was part of the modified Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
Study inclusion criteria were defined as that studies needed to include paediatric patients who were 
treated with brentuximab vedotin, studies needed to have relevant efficacy and safety outcome data 
and should be a RCTs, nRCTs or observational study. Twenty-three publications, reporting the findings 
of 12 unique studies, met the inclusion criteria.  Of these, 11 studies were included in the meta-
analysis, nine for the efficacy outcome analyses and 11 for the exploratory safety outcome analyses. 
The following efficacy outcomes were analyzed based on available data: OS (data available from 3 
studies); ORR (data available from 6 studies); CR (c data available from 9 studies) and PR (data 
available from 3 studies). Exploratory safety analyses were also conducted. 
The results showed an estimated 96.9% of patients were alive at 3 months; 91% at 12 months and 
87% at 24 months. For response outcomes, an estimated 79% of patients achieved a response, with 
the majority of these experiencing a CR as best response outcome. A separate calculation for CR, 
based on more study data than was available for ORR,  suggested that around 73% of patients achieve 
CR when treated with brentuximab vedotin. PR analysis suggested 14% of patients experience a PR, in 
addition to the >70% experiencing a CR. 
It appears  that most studies used in this meta-analysis include relapsed/refractory patients. Without 
further discussion on the impact of e.g. differences in study population, backbone therapy, etc, the 
results of the meta-analysis provide at this point limited support for the results obtained by study 
C25004.  
For paediatric patients with previously untreated Stage III or Stage IV HL, long and healthy 
survivorship are the ultimate treatment goals. According to the applicant study C25004 is currently too 
early in its observation to determine if these treatment goals will be met. This is agreed. Two-year 
follow-up of PFS and EFS is ongoing, and 10-year follow-up of OS, cardiac toxicity, and second 
malignancies continues. 
Safety 
The safety population consisted of 59 patients who received at least 1 dose of any drug in the A+AVD 
regimen. All treated patients completed the maximum 6 cycles of protocol therapy (A+AVD). 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 6/78 
 
 
 
At least 1 TEAE of any grade was reported for all 59 patients (100%) and at least 1 drug-related TEAE 
of any grade for 57 patients (97%) in the safety population. At least 1 Grade 3 or higher TEAE was 
reported for 54 patients (92%) and was considered drug-related for 51 patients (86%). At least 1 SAE 
was reported for 24 patients (41%) and was considered drug-related for 19 patients (32%). No AEs 
were reported that resulted in the premature and permanent discontinuation of study treatment, and 
no on-study deaths were reported in the study. 
Most frequently reported TEAE were vomiting (85% of patients); nausea (75%); neutropenia (58%); 
pyrexia and WBC count decreased (42% each); abdominal pain (39%); constipation, neutrophil count 
decreased, and stomatitis (37% each); headache (32%); anaemia, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, and 
back pain (24% each); oropharyngeal pain and weight decreased (22% each); and fatigue (20%). 
At least 1 SAE was reported for 24 patients (41%) in the safety population. Febrile neutropenia was 
the most commonly reported SAE, i.e. for 17% of patients. Neutropenia and vomiting were reported as 
SAE for 5% of patients each. 
Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) is a well characterized adverse drug reaction for brentuximab vedotin. At 
least 1 PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 14 patients (24%) in the safety population. A 
Grade 2 PN (SMQ) event (the highest severity reported in the study) was reported for 3 patients (5%), 
and a PN (SMQ) event led to dose reduction for 2 patients (3%). The PT, PMN was reported as an SAE 
for 1 patient (2%). Resolution of all PN events was reported for most patients for whom at least 1 PN 
(SMQ) event was reported during treatment. At the time of the last follow-up, resolution of all PN 
events was reported for 11 patients (79%) among the 14 patients for whom at least 1 PN event was 
reported. Resolution of at least 1 PN event was reported at a median of 1.57 weeks (range, 0.3-50.3 
weeks). 
Safety data for subgroups including patients 5-11 years of age and patients 12-17 years of age was 
provided. The toxicity profile of brentuximab-vedotin seemed to be similar  for paediatric age groups 
from 5 years on. From the toxicity profile already known from adults study with A+AVD, no new 
adverse drug reactions were observed in the paediatric population receiving the A+AVD combination. 
However,  as stated above, the meta-analysis includes studies in which brentuximab is used in different 
combinational treatment regimens at different doses and in different patient populations (most 
patients with r/r disease). The sensitivity analysis that includes studies sharing specific characteristic 
with regard to treatment or patients population, generally involves only few studies. In general, the 
heterogeneity between the studies was high. The safety results from the meta-analysis are thus 
considered exploratory. Considering all above the value of this meta-analysis in support of the safety 
profile of brentuximab vedotin+AVD combination therapy in newly diagnosed paediatric HL patients, is 
limited without further discussion.   
Long term safety data for brentuximab vedotin+AVD is not yet available. 
In conclusion, with the currently submitted single arm  study the benefit of brentuximab vedotin for 
the treatment of newly diagnosed paediatric HL patients, cannot be definitively determined. The 
efficacy results are not contextualized. Also similarity and differences between the efficacy results 
obtained in the paediatric HL population compared to those obtained in adult HL patients was not 
thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the submitted meta-analysis without further discussion provides 
limited support.  
Even so, the discussed limitations of the submitted data are not considered a concern for this variation 
with and the provided data package is sufficient for an update of the SmPC. However, in case the MAH 
wants to extend the indication to the first line HL paediatric patients in the future the following is 
recommended:  
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 7/78 
 
 
 
- further develop the popPK model; 
- expand on the contextualisation of the single arm data by justifying that the meta-analyses can be 
used to support the C25004 data or focus on external data obtained in the first line; 
- include a full extrapolation exercise as described in the EMA Reflection paper on the use of 
extrapolation in the development of medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018). 
The benefit-risk balance of Adcetris, remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
On the dossier and regulatory background 
The MAH is submitting with this variation application data from Study C25004, a single-arm study 
designed to assess PK, safety, and antitumour activity of brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
adriamycin (doxorubicin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) in paediatric patients with previously 
untreated Stage III  or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). 
Also included in this submission is a meta-analysis of clinical studies for brentuximab vedotin in 
paediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma as supportive background data on paediatric cHL.  
The MAH is not applying here for a paediatric extension of indication for the treatment of Hodgkin 
lymphoma within this procedure but proposes to update the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 with 
data from study C25004. Information on paediatric use of brentuximab vedotin is already included in 
the SmPC. This was based on the results of Study C25002, that was assessed during variation 
EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0049 in order to fulfil article 46 of EC Regulation No 1901/2006. 
On the product 
ADCETRIS (Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35)) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) 
(recombinant chimeric immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1], produced by recombinant DNA technology in 
Chinese Hamster ovary cells) consisting of 3 components: 
1) the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30; 
2) the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE); and  
3) a protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. 
Brentuximab vedotin is proposed to have a multi-step mechanism of action that is initiated by binding 
to CD30 on the cell surface and internalization of the ADC. Upon trafficking to lysosomes, MMAE is 
released from the conjugate through proteolytic degradation of the drug linker. Binding of released 
MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network, leading to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis.  
Current indication 
The currently approved indications for ADCETRIS are: 
Hodgkin lymphoma 
ADCETRIS is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ HL at increased risk of relapse 
or progression following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) (see section 5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ Hodgkin 
lymphoma (HL):  
1. 
2. 
following ASCT, or 
following at least two prior  therapies when ASCT or multi agent chemotherapy is not a 
treatment option. 
Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
ADCETRIS in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (CHP) is indicated for 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 10/78 
 
 
 
adult patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma  (sALCL) (see section 
5.1). 
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. 
Cutaneous T cell lymphoma  
ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with CD30+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma 
(CTCL) after at least 1 prior  systemic therapy (see section 5.1). 
Extract from Current posology  
The recommended dose for monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone) is 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes 
every 3 weeks. 
The recommended dose in combination with chemotherapy (doxorubicin [A], vinblastine [V] and 
dacarbazine [D] [AVD]) is 1.2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on 
days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. 
If the patient’s weight is more than 100 kg, the dose calculation should use 100 kg. 
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
The clinical pharmacology of brentuximab vedotin (antibody-drug conjugate [ADC] and monomethyl 
auristatin E [MMAE]) in paediatric patients was evaluated in Studies C25002 and C25004. Integrated 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling of PK data from both studies is performed to support the 
proposed dosing regimens and to compare  exposure with exposure in adult patients.  
Results from study C25002 have been evaluated in procedure EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0049. A summary 
of pharmacokinetic data of brentuximab vedotin monotherapy in paediatric patients from study 
C25002 is presented here. Plasma PK parameters  of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE following IV 
administration of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin Q3W in paediatric patients for in Cycles 1 and 8 in 
are summarised in Table 1. Median brentuximab vedotin AUC in children adolescents from this study 
was approximately  14% and 3% lower than in adult patients, respectively, while MMAE exposures 
were 53% lower and 13% higher, respectively, than in adult patients. There was a trend observed for 
lower brentuximab vedotin exposures at lower ages/ body weights in the study population. Simulations 
of different dosing regimens showed that BSA based dosing results exposure approximately  similar 
across different body weight ranges and similar to exposure. There was a trend of increased clearance 
of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients confirmed positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). No 
patients aged <12 years and 2 patients aged ≥12 became persistently ADA positive.

Because the pharmacokinetic data from study C25002 indicated that BSA based dosing would result in 
exposure approximately  similar across different body weight ranges, dosing in study C25004 was BSA 
based, i.e. 48 mg/m2 Q2W. Immunogenicity was evaluated. Further, an exploratory  exposure-response 
analysis was conducted using data from Study C25004 to evaluate relationships between steady-state 
ADC and MMAE exposure and selected safety and efficacy endpoints. 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted  (study C25004) 
Design of study C25004  
Study C25004 was an open-label, multi-centre, phase 1/2 study of A+AVD in 59 paediatric patients 
with previously untreated Stage III or Stage IV cHL. Patient ages at study entry ranged from 6 to 17 
years. The median age was 14 years. 
The study was the first to investigate body surface area (BSA)-based dosing and the A+AVD 
combination in children. Patients (N=59) received 48 mg/m2of brentuximab vedotin administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes + doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 
375 mg/m2 every 2 weeks (Q2W) were analysed for overall response rate (ORR) per independent 
review facility (IRF) and other safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints. 
Design – PK sampling 
In Study C25004, body surface area (BSA)-based doses of 48 mg/m2 brentuximab vedotin given every 
2 weeks (Q2W) were evaluated in combination with a multiagent chemotherapy regimen (adriamycin 
[doxorubicin], vinblastine, and dacarbazine [AVD]) in paediatric patients with advanced-stage (Ann 
Arbor  Stage III  or IV),  newly diagnosed, CD30-positive (CD30+) classical HL.  For patients with a BSA 
>2.5 mg/m2, the dose was calculated based on a BSA of 2.5 mg/m2, as the maximum  dose of 
brentuximab vedotin that a patient could receive was 120 mg. AVD was administered first, and 
brentuximab vedotin was administered approximately  1 hour later by IV infusion. Blood samples for 
determination of serum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin and TAb and plasma concentrations of 
MMAE were collected at the following time points during phase 1: 
•  Cycles 1 through 6: On Day 1 and Day 15 within 4 hours before the start of the brentuximab 
vedotin infusion and at the end of the infusion (EOI). 
Assessment report

•  Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: Additional samples collected 24 hours (Day 2), 48 hours (Day 3), 72 
hours (Day 4), and 168 hours (Day 8) from the start of the Day 1 brentuximab vedotin 
infusion and 24 hours (Day 16), 48 hours (Day 17), 72 hours (Day 18), and 168 hours (Day 
22) from the start of the Day 15 brentuximab vedotin infusion. 
The PK sampling schedule was revised during phase 2 to omit blood collection on Days 16, 17, 18, and 
22 during Cycles 1 and 3 to reduce blood collection burden on patients. 
Blood samples were collected at screening, pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and at EOT to 
evaluate serum ADA and for ADA-positive samples only, Nab status (negative or positive). 
Population 
In total, 59 (28 female, 31 male) paediatric patients were enrolled with a median age of 14 years 
(range, 6-17 years). Eleven patients (19%) were between 6 and 11 years, and 48 patients (81%) 
were between 12 and 17 years. Baseline characteristics of the paediatric patients from studies C25002 
and C25004 are shown in Table 2.

Bioanalysis 
Plasma concentrations of brentuximab vedotin total antibody (Tab, 2156 samples,  2146 evaluable) and 
ADC (2156 samples, 2152 evaluable) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
Assessment report

(ELISA) with a validated range between 12.5 and 400 ng/mL. Plasma concentrations of MMAE were 
measured after solid phase extraction using high performance liquid chromatography followed by 
tandem mass spectrometric detection with a validated analytical range between 25.0 to 1000 pg/mL. 
The methods have been previously validated at Covance Laboratories  Inc. 
Serum samples were tested for antidrug antibodies (ADA; previously described as antitherapeutic 
antibodies [ATA],  293 samples – 291 evaluable) to brentuximab vedotin using 
electrochemiluminescence with an assay sensitivity of 4 ng/mL. Serum samples were also evaluated 
for the presence of neutralizing antidrug antibodies (Nab; previously described as neutralizing 
antitherapeutic antibodies [nATA]) to brentuximab vedotin using an ELISA-based assay. 
Since the method selectivity experiments were performed in the normal matrix during validation, 
additional selectivity testing was performed in Hodgkins Lymphoma serum samples for both the PK 
(CB-0202/CB-0203) and ADA (CB-1079/CB-1080a/CB-1823/CB-1824) assays. 
In study performance of QC were in line with the validation, incurred sample reanalysis demonstrated 
acceptable reproducibility.   
Pharmacokinetic analyses 
PK parameters were calculated from individual plasma (MMAE) or serum ADC, TAb concentration-time 
data using noncompartmental methods using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.2, Certara, Princeton, NJ). 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize  PK parameters  of ADC, TAb,  and MMAE by dose group 
(as applicable),  cycle, and day. Individual and mean serum and/or plasma concentration data were 
plotted over time by dose cohort and cycle/day. 
Population PK analyses 
Two population PK models were developed for this analysis one for ADC and one for MMAE. The ADC 
model was developed and finalized first, and then the model for MMAE was developed in which the 
MMAE formation was linked to ADC elimination using the individual parameter  estimates from the ADC 
model to predict the ADC concentrations in the MMAE model. The models previously developed for 
brentuximab vedotin for Study C25002 were used a starting point (see assessment report of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0049).  
The objectives of this POP PK analysis were to: 
• Develop 2 POP PK models (ADC and MMAE) to describe concentration-time data arising from studies 
C25002 and C25004 of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients, 
• Identify and characterize patient factors which influence the PK and PK variability of ADC and MMAE, 
• Estimate the magnitude of unexplained variability in PK in paediatric patients, 
• Evaluate the model performance of the 2 PK models developed, and use these models to summarize 
the systemic exposures of ADC and MMAE estimated in patients in studies C25002 and C25004. 
Database 
Dataset included 9479 records, 2608 from study C25002 and 6871 from study C25004 from 95 
paediatric patients. There were 978 dosing records and 8501 concentration records. Of the 
concentration records, 2899 were ADC concentrations and 2748 were MMAE concentrations and 2854 
were SGN35 concentrations. The SGN concentrations were not used in the analysis. Continuous 
baseline characteristics of the patients are summarised in Table 2. 
For ADC, there were 95 ADC concentration records excluded from the analysis, 91 were predose 
concentrations, 2 did not have concentration values, 1 had a clock time issue, and 1 had an issue with

the time of the sample. There were 31 records excluded due to |CWRES| values greater than 5. Also, 
21 BLQ samples were excluded from the analysis. As a result, 2752 ADC concentration records were 
included in the analysis. 
For MMAE, there 87 MMAE concentration records excluded from the analysis all due to being predose 
concentrations. There was 1 record excluded due to CWRES values greater than 5. There was one 
record without a concentration. Also, 76 BLQ samples were excluded from the analysis. As a result, 
2583 ADC concentration records were included in the analysis. 
There were 0.7% ADC BLQ records (21 records out of 2773 total ADC records including the BLQ 
records) and 2.9% MMAE BLQ records (76 records out of 2659 total MMAE records including the BLQ 
records). As a result, all BLQ records were excluded (commented out) from the analysis dataset. Given 
the low percentage of BLQ records this is considered acceptable. 
PopPK model 
The model for ADC PK was a linear three-compartment model with zero-order input and first-order 
elimination. The pharmacokinetic model parameters  are shown in Table 3. IIV was included on CL, Q2, 
and V3 and the %CV was high for these parameters  at 65 or less; however, shrinkage for these terms 
was 13.4% or less indicating the individual parameter  values were acceptable. The covariates on CL 
included an increasing CL with increasing BSA; decreasing CL with increasing ALB concentration; 
decreasing CL with increasing tumour size, a higher CL for ATA positivity although there were very few 
ATA positive records, and a higher CL for patients on concurrent AVD treatment. Non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma patients had approximately  ½ smaller  Q2 parameter  values than the Hodgkins lymphoma 
patients. V3 increased with increasing BSA.  Parameter precision had a 32.2% standard error  (SE) or 
less. Residual variability was 32.1% and the condition number was 14.

MMAE is attached to the anti-CD30 antibody on ADC via a protease-cleavable linker, and as a result, 
the actual dose of MMAE is unknown. Therefore the PK model of MMAE is primarily  descriptive. The PK 
model for MMAE included a link to ADC elimination using the individual parameter  estimates from the 
ADC model to predict the ADC concentrations in the MMAE model. The PK of MMAE was described by a 
two-compartment model with first-order elimination and formation of MMAE both directly from ADC 
and through binding of ADC to a hypothetical target. The model had a lag compartment to describe the 
delay in the formation of MMAE both directly from ADC and through binding of ADC to the target. The 
fraction of MMAE formed directly from ADC is assumed to decrease following ADC administration, 
relative to TAD. 
During the development of the MMAE model, it was initially determined that including IIV on CL, Vc, 
and the ADC to MMAE conversion rate (ALFM) resulted in the best model fit based on the OBJ value. 
Covariate effects were evaluated on this model. The covariates included in the model were ALB,  ATA 
positivity, BSA and creatinine concentration on CL, non-HL tumour type, BSA on Vc and, non-HL 
tumour type on ALFM. Although creatinine concentration on CL did not decrease the OBJ by the needed 
amount, it was kept in the model based on previous modelling experience with brentuximab vedotin . 
After the completion of this stage of the model building, an ETA on Kd was added to the model due to 
a very significant decrease in the OBJ of 682 points. A visual inspection of the Kd ETA by covariate 
plots showed a trend with ALB  and Kd. This effect was added to the model and resulted in a further 
decrease in the OBJ of 113 points. This model was selected as the final model. 
The pharmacokinetic model parameters for MMAE are shown in Table 4. The final MMAE parameter 
precision SE% was acceptable at 27.5% or less. All the IIV parameter values had a high %CV with a 
range of 50.6 to 147. However,  the shrinkage ranged from 4.2 to 18.8% indicating simulations with 
this model would result in acceptable individual parameter  values of AUC, Cmax, and Cmin. Residual 
variability was moderate at 37.5%. The condition number was at 5.18. The covariates effects showed 
that MMAE CL decreases with increasing creatinine concentration and ALB  concentration, and increases

with increasing BSA. MMAE CL is higher with ATA negativity compared to ATA positivity. MMAE central 
volume is larger for patients with HL compared to non-HL patients and Vc increases with increasing 
BSA.  ALFM is comparable  between patients with HL and ALCL. MMAE Kd decreases with increasing ALB 
concentration.

Exposure-Response Analyses 
Data from Study C25004 were used to conduct descriptive exposure-response analyses to describe 
relationships between brentuximab vedotin exposure and safety or efficacy outcomes. Exploratory 
analyses of relationships between ADC and MMAE steady-state exposures, and the following safety 
endpoints were evaluated: Grade 3 or higher neutropenia or neutrophil count decrease (NEU3), febrile 
neutropenia (FN), any grade of peripheral  neuropathy (PN), and Grade 3 or higher treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAE3). Exploratory analyses of relationships between ADC and MMAE 
steady-state exposures, and the following efficacy endpoints were evaluated: overall response rate 
(ORR, CR+PR) and progression-free survival (PFS). 
Graphical explorations for each of the safety and efficacy endpoints were conducted to evaluate 
whether a trend with ADC and/or MMAE exposures were evident. If there was an exposure-response 
trend, logistic regression for binary type data, or Cox proportional  hazard regression for survival-type 
data, were used to further evaluate the exposure-response relationship. The exposure metrics and 
limited covariates were tested using a full model approach (i.e., add all covariates of interest, and 
remove one by one if not significant). All statistical analysis and data processing were performed using 
R Statistical Software (version 4.0.3). 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity data were summarized for patients in the immunogenicity population and presented 
using descriptive statistics into the following categories: ADA negative, transiently ADA positive, 
persistently ADA positive, low (≤25) and high (>25) ADA titer, and Nab status (negative or positive) as 
defined in the study protocol for ADA-positive patients only. 
6.2.  Results 
Study C25004 – non-compartmental analysis  
Following IV administration of brentuximab vedotin, ADC Cmax occurred approximately  at the end of 
infusion (Figure 3). ADC serum concentrations declined in a multi-exponential manner with a t1/2z of 
approximately  4 days. Accumulation of ADC in serum was approximately  1.3 fold from Cycle 1 to Cycle 
3 with a Q2W regimen of 48 mg/m2 brentuximab vedotin.

Following IV administration of brentuximab vedotin, median tmax of MMAE occurred in plasma 
approximately  2 days post-dose (Figure 4). MMAE plasma concentrations declined log-linearly, with a 
mean t1/2z of approximately  2 days. Following repeated doses of brentuximab vedotin at 48 mg/m2 
Q2W, MMAE concentrations in plasma decreased to approximately  40% of the values of the first 
administration.

Comparison between paediatric patients and adult patients  
Simulations were performed to evaluate ADC and MMAE exposure in order to compare  dosing regimens 
between paediatric and adult patients (Figure 7). Simulations were performed to compare  ADC and 
MMAE exposure in paediatric patients from Study C25004 administered 48 mg/m2 Q2W in combination 
with chemotherapy AVD to adult patients with advanced HL from Study C25003 administered 1.2 
mg/kg Q2W in combination with chemotherapy AVD. Boxplots of ADC and MMAE AUC are provided in 
Figure 7. ADC AUC for these dosing regimens overlap across the age groups indicating that 
administration of brentuximab vedotin to paediatric patients based on BSA results in similar exposure 
to adults administered doses based on body weight. A similar conclusion about consistent exposures in 
paediatric patients across age ranges can be made for MMAE AUC even though the range of the adult 
AUC is in the upper range of the paediatric AUC values.

Exposure response 
In total, 59 subjects from Study C25004 were included in the exposure-response (safety and efficacy) 
analyses. The time-averaged AUC for ADC and MMAE were used as exposure metrics, in which time-
averaged AUC at steady state was calculated for the Q2W dose interval (AUCτ,SS). These exposure 
metrics were obtained from the individual predicted concentration-time profiles for 1 cycle (Day 1 to 
Day 15) at steady state, using individual post-hoc PK parameter estimates derived from the final 
population PK model. 
Efficacy: PFS was the only efficacy endpoint that was evaluated in the exposure-efficacy analysis. All 
59 subjects were alive and most responded to the treatment (either CR or PR) for the study duration, 
including treatment cycles and follow-up period. Therefore, overall survival analysis and ORR analysis 
were not conducted. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS by tertiles of time-averaged AUC exposure for both ADC and MMAE showed 
no apparent relationship between ADC or MMAE exposures and PFS. The exposures of ADC or MMAE 
were not significant based on a log-rank test. Therefore, no further evaluation with a statistical model 
was conducted. 
Safety: The relationships between ADC and MMAE exposure and the following AEs were examined: 
NEU3, FN, PN, and TEAE3. 
The relationships between exposure metrics (time-averaged AUCτ,ss with ADC and MMAE) and AEs of 
interest were evaluated using a logistic regression model. In this analysis, age and sex were also 
tested as potential covariates only if ADC or MMAE was a significant predictor of any of the AEs 
evaluated. No apparent relationships were identified between ADC exposures and the incidence of PN, 
NEU3, FN, or TEAE3. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the incidence of FN with increasing 
exposure of MMAE, consistent with what was observed in adults. The model predictions for the 
probability  of FN events over the range of MMAE exposure is provided in Figure 8. There were no 
statistically significant relationships identified between MMAE exposure and PN, NEU3, or TEAE3.

Immunogenicity in Study C25004 
All 59 patients (100%) had available immunogenicity data (received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
had at least 1 baseline and postbaseline immunogenicity assessment) for inclusion in immunogenicity 
analyses. All patients except 1 were ADA negative at baseline. The patient with a positive result at 
baseline had an ADA titre of <5.00 at baseline. 
Overall, 55 of the 59 patients (93%) were ADA negative (not confirmed positive) at all postbaseline 
time points, and 4 patients (7%) were ADA positive at some time point postbaseline. ADA status is 
considered positive if both the screening and the confirmatory result are positive at a given cycle. All 4 
patients were transiently ADA positive with a low (≤25) ADA titre. Among these 4 ADA-positive 
patients, 3 were ADA negative at baseline and developed ADA after administration of brentuximab 
vedotin. The patient who was ADA positive at baseline (baseline titre <5.00) also had positive ADA 
results postbaseline, but the titres did not increase, indicating that this patient had pre-existing ADA 
instead of the drug-induced ADA. No patients were persistently ADA positive. Two of 59 patients (3%) 
were Nab positive. 
6.3.  Discussion 
Study C25004 was a single-arm study designed to assess PK, safety, and antitumour activity of 
brentuximab vedotin (ADC) in combination with adriamycin (doxorubicin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine 
(A+AVD) in paediatric patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma 
(cHL). Previously, pharmacokinetic data from study C25002 (procedure EMEA/H/C/002455/II/0049) in 
paediatric patients treated with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg monotherapy had indicated that BSA 
based dosing would result in exposure approximately  similar across different body weight ranges. 
Therefore, dosing in study C25004 was BSA based, i.e.  48 mg/m2 Q2W in combination with AVD in a 
4-weeks cycle. PK rich data for ADC and MMAE, the unbound toxin, were collected in cycles 1 and 3. 
Pharmacokinetics was evaluated by non-compartmental analysis and by popPK analysis. Integrated 
population pharmacokinetic modelling of PK data from both studies is performed to support the 
proposed dosing regimens and to compare  exposure with exposure in adult patients. An exploratory 
exposure-response analysis was conducted using data from Study C25004 to evaluate relationships 
between steady-state ADC and MMAE exposure and selected safety and efficacy endpoints. In addition, 
immunogenicity was evaluated.  
Pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE in paediatric patients study C25004 
Study C25004 enrolled 59 patients, eleven patients (19%) were between 6 and 11 years, and 48 
patients (81%) were between 12 and 17 years.  
Maximum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC were typically observed at the end of infusion or 
the sampling timepoint closest to the end of infusion. A multiexponential decline in ADC serum 
concentrations was observed with a terminal half-life of approximately  4 days. A 30% higher AUC 
exposure of ADC was observed with multiple doses at the every 2-week schedule, which is slightly 
higher than anticipated for a terminal half-life of 4 days. Typical Cmax and AUC of ADC after a single 
48 mg/m2 dose was approximately  23 μg/mL and 47 μg.day/mL respectively. Mean Cmax and AUC of 
MMAE were 4.9 ng/mL, 27 ng.day/mL. MMAE exposures decreased after multiple doses of brentuximab 
vedotin with approximately  50% to 70% of the exposure of the first dose being observed at 
subsequent doses. 
ADC and MMAE exposures were comparable  for paediatric patients <12 and ≥ 12 years of age 
supporting the BSA-based dosing of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients.

PopPK estimated an approximately  2-fold higher ADC clearance for patients on concurrent treatment 
with AVD. This is rather unexpected since non-compartmental analysis indicated only a 10-25% lower 
ADC exposure in paediatric patients with concurrent chemotherapy and in adults on concurrent 
treatment with AVD, pharmacokinetics of ADC was consistent with that of monotherapy. This apparent 
inconsistency in effect of concurrent AVD treatment between paediatric and adult patients needs to be 
clarified when the MAH wants to apply for an indication in paediatric patients. Mean MMAE exposures 
were comparable  for the first administration for paediatric patients in studies C25002 and C25004 but 
were slightly lower for the combination therapy in cycle 3, although there was an overlap in exposures.  
PopPK analysis - comparison with exposure in adult patients 
For study C25004, mean AUC exposure estimates were comparable  for non-compartmental and for 
popPK simulations for both ADC and MMAE in paediatric patients treated with brentuximab vedotin 48 
mg/m2 Q2W in combination with chemotherapy. For brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg Q3W, mean ADC 
AUC exposures estimates by popPK were ~30% higher than non-compartmental analysis. Remarkably, 
VPC plots (Figure 1) suggested an underprediction of the ADC serum concentrations for study C25002 
and a overprediction of ADC plasma values for study C25004. Since these were not predicted corrected 
VPC plots, while there is some time variance these plots are difficult to interpret. The popPK  model for 
ADC and especially for MMAE shows overestimation of the variability (Figure 1 and Figure 2), the 
intersubject variability of the simulated PK parameters  was considerably higher than observed in the 
non-compartmental analysis (compare Table 1, Table 5, and Table 6). While the objective function of 
the popPK improved by inclusion of the co-variates, the unexplained variability was not improved 
compared to the base model, and apparently the co-variates had no significant effect (see Figure 6). 
Therefore, the popPK  models of ADC and MMAE are considered suitable for descriptive purposes only, 
not for simulation purposes and consequently comparison with adult exposures and exposure-effect 
analysis are considered exploratory only.  
Based on non-compartmental PK across study comparison (compare  Table 5 and Table 7), ADC and 
MMAE steady-state exposures were comparable in paediatric patients from Study C25004 administered 
48 mg/m2 Q2W in combination with chemotherapy AVD and in adult patients with advanced HL from 
Study C25003 administered 1.2 mg/kg Q2W in combination with chemotherapy AVD.  
There are sufficient pharmacokinetic data from the non-compartmental analysis to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE in paediatric patients from studies C25002 (brentuximab vedotin 
1.8 mg/kg Q3W) and C25004 (brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m2 Q2W in combination with 
chemotherapy) in the SmPC section 5.2, therefore, no questions regarding the popPK  model will be 
raised in this procedure. When the MAH wants to apply for an indication in paediatric patients with a 
difference dosing than used in the clinical study(ies), it is suggested to review the popPK model to 
reduce the observed bias and to reduce the overpredicted variability.  The MAH is then kindly requested 
to include the output files, figures of individual predictions, and provide pcVPC with predicted and 
observed median and median 5% - 95% indicated. 
Immunogenicity 
Overall, 55 of the 59 patients (93%) were ADA negative at all postbaseline time points, and 4 patients 
(7%) were ADA positive at some time point postbaseline of which 1 patients was already ADA positive 
at baseline. All 4 patients were transiently ADA positive with a low (≤25) ADA titre. Two of 59 patients 
(3%) were Nab positive. The low immunogenicity is in line with previous observation, there are not 
sufficient data to draw a conclusion on the effect of ADAs on the pharmacokinetics of ADC. The text in 
the SmPC 4.8 has been adequately updated with the ADA incidence in paediatric patients from study 
C25004. 
Conclusions 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021

The MAH does not apply for a paediatric indication within this procedure, but proposes modification of 
the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 with data from study C25004.  
Since there are sufficient pharmacokinetic data from the non-compartmental analysis to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE in paediatric patients from studies C25002 (brentuximab vedotin 
1.8 mg/kg Q3W) and C25004 (brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m2 Q2W in combination with 
chemotherapy) in the SmPC section 5.2, no questions regarding the popPK  model will be raised. The 
MAH is recommended for future applications to review the popPK  model. The text in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC has been amended to report  the pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE as determined by non-
compartmental analysis.  
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
As part of this type II variation, intended to update the paediatric data presented in the ADCETRIS 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), the final results of Study C25004 in paediatric patients 
with previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma  (cHL)are submitted by the MAH. 
In addition a meta-analysis of clinical studies for brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients with 
Hodgkin lymphoma were submitted.  
Study C25004 
Study C25004 was a global, multi-centre study conducted at 14 investigative sites, which included 2 
US sites and 12 ex-US sites located in 3 countries (Brazil,  Japan, Italy). Site initiation visits were 
conducted and study drug distributed at 12 additional investigative sites (1 site each in Italy, Hong 
Kong, and Singapore, 2 sites each in Japan, Taiwan, and the US, and 3 sites in Brazil) but no patients 
were enrolled at these sites. 
Study C25004, an extension of the ongoing brentuximab vedotin development program in adult 
patients, was intended to investigate potential use in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Stage 
III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma  (cHL). Study C25004 was a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-agent, 
multicentre study of brentuximab vedotin given in combination with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) in paediatric patients with advanced-stage, newly diagnosed 
classical CD30+ first-line HL.  
The study consists of 2 phases.  
Primary  Objective of phase 1 was to assess the safety and tolerability,  and to identify the 
recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin when combined with multiagent chemotherapy regimen 
AVD for first-line treatment of advanced-stage HL in paediatric patients. 
Primary  Objective of phase 2 was:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the CR rate of paediatric patients with advanced-stage HL at the end of protocol 
therapy. 
To determine the percentage of patients who were PET-negative after 2 cycles of protocol 
therapy. 
To evaluate the PR rate of paediatric patients with advanced-stage HL at the end of protocol 
therapy. 
To evaluate the ORR of paediatric patients with advanced-stage HL at the end of protocol 
therapy. 
To determine the percentage of patients who were able to complete 6 cycles of protocol 
therapy at the recommended dose.

7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study C25004 was a phase 1/2, open-label, multiagent, multi-centre study of brentuximab vedotin 
given in combination with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) in 
paediatric patients with advanced-stage, newly diagnosed classical CD30+ first-line HL (see study 
design scheme Figure 9). 
 Figure 9 Study C25004: Dosing scheme 
DLT: dose-limiting toxicity; Pts: patients. 
The first 3 patients enrolled in the study were to be monitored for DLTs during the DLT observation 
period (Cycle 1 +28 days [from the first dose through Study Day 56]). If no or 1 DLTs occurred in the 
first 3 patients, 3 additional patients were to be enrolled and monitored for DLTs. If the first 6 patients 
completed the DLT observation with no patient or 1 patient experiencing a DLT, 48 mg/m2 was to be 
the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin, and approximately  49 additional patients were to be 
enrolled in the phase 2 study to further assess safety and efficacy for a total of at least 55 evaluable 
patients at the recommended dose in the study. Available PK data were to be reviewed along with the 
safety data to guide the final decision on the recommended dose. 
Study population 
The paediatric study population consisted of patients aged 5 to < 18 years with advanced-stage (Stage 
III or Stage IV), newly diagnosed CD30+ cHL who were treatment naïve and had a Karnofsky 
Performance Status or Lansky Play-Performance of ≥50. Patient eligibility was established before each 
patient enrolled in the study.

Treatment 
Study C25004 was an open-label, single-arm study with no reference therapy. Treatment group 
assignments were not applicable.  No randomization scheme or codes were used in the study.  
The components of A+AVD used in this study were considered investigational medicinal products and 
were supplied by the study sponsor. A+AVD consists of brentuximab vedotin 48 or 36 mg/m2, plus 
doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine . 
A: Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 was to be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 15 of 
each 28-day cycle. 
V: Vinblastine: 6 mg/m2 was to be administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. 
D: Dacarbazine: 375 mg/m2 was to be administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day 
cycle. 
Brentuximab vedotin was to be administered after AVD: 
A: brentuximab vedotin: 48 or 36 mg/m2 was to be administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of 
each 28-day cycle, starting approximately  1 hour after the end of the dacarbazine administration.

Dosing was based on the patient’s BSA according to the institutional standard. However,  it was 
required that doses be adjusted for patients who experienced a ≥10% change in BSA from the most 
recent dose calculation. The dose was calculated based on a BSA of 2.5 m2 for patients with a BSA of 
>2.5 m2 to ensure that patients received no more than the maximum brentuximab vedotin dose of 120 
mg. The dose was rounded to the nearest whole number milligrams.  Recommended dosing of 
brentuximab vedotin could need to be modified in case of AE (Table 8) 
Table 8 Study C25004: Recommended Brentuximab Vedotin Dose Modifications for Treatment-
Associated Toxicity 
Study treatment was to be discontinued after completion of 6 cycles of protocol therapy, occurrence of 
unacceptable adverse event (AE), progressive disease (PD), patient withdrawal, or study termination. 
Patients could have discontinued protocol therapy at any time. 
For patients who received radiation at EOT, ISRT  recommendations consisted of 2100cGy in 14 
fractions of 150cGy per day. Treatment was to be administered 5 days per week. All fields were to be 
treated once per day.

Definitions of endpoints 
ORR: the percentage of patients who achieved a CR or PR at EOT, by IRF assessment using PET, CT, 
MRI 
PFS: PFS by IRF assessment was defined as the time from the first dose until disease progression by 
IRF assessment or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
EFS: EFS by IRF assessment was defined as the time from the first dose until any treatment failure: 
PD by IRF assessment including progression events during follow-up period, failure to complete 6 
cycles of treatment for any reason, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
DOR: DOR by IRF assessment in patients with a response (CR or PR per IRF) was defined as the time 
from start of the first objective tumour response (CR or PR per IRF) to the first subsequent PD or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Response to treatment and disease status assessments were evaluated according to the International 
Working Group (IWG) Revised Criteria for Response Assessment for Malignant Lymphoma.  These 
disease assessments were performed by investigators and an independent review facility (IRF) at 
times specified in the SOE. Evaluations were to be performed as defined in the SOE until PD was 
documented by the investigator, death occurred, or the study ended.  
B symptoms (fever, night sweats, and/or weight loss) were to be recorded at screening, on Day 1 of 
each treatment cycle, at the EOT visit, and every 12 weeks during PTFU. 
A bone marrow  biopsy was to be collected at screening within 28 days of the first dose of protocol 
therapy. For patients with a positive bone marrow  biopsy at screening, a second bone marrow  biopsy 
was required to confirm response within 2 weeks after documentation of response at either Cycle 2 
Day 25 or at the EOT visit. A repeat biopsy was not required once it was determined that the bone 
marrow  sample was negative. 
Patient-reported and parent proxy HRQOL assessments were scheduled to be performed at screening, 
on Day 1 of Cycle 1, at every other cycle thereafter, at the EOT visit, and during PTFU visits. The 
Assessment report

PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales is a 23-item questionnaire designed to measure HRQOL in children 
and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years, and the PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module is a 27-item questionnaire 
designed to measure paediatric cancer-specific HRQOL. 
Blood samples were scheduled to be collected at screening (baseline), on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 
or at termination of treatment if treatment is terminated before Cycle 6, and at EOT to evaluate serum 
ADA and Nab.  Blood samples for ADA and Nab assessment were scheduled to be collected before 
administration of study treatment. Nab assessment was performed for ADA-positive samples only. The 
incidence of ADA and Nab to brentuximab vedotin was determined and the effect of ADA and Nab on 
PK, efficacy, and safety was assessed. 
AEs were assessed, and laboratory values and vital signs measurements were obtained to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of protocol therapy. Toxicity was evaluated according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03, effective 14 
June 2010. 
DLT was defined as any of the following events with onset during the DLT observation period that were 
considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to brentuximab vedotin therapy: 
•  Any nonhematologic Grade 3 or higher toxicity except for any Grade 3 or higher 
nonhematologic toxicity that occurred in the absence of optimal supportive therapy (eg, 
antiemetic, antidiarrheal) and lasted more  than 5 consecutive days (such as vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation, pyrexia,  infection, or mucosal inflammation). 
Grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity (except Grade 3 alopecia) that was controllable to Grade 2 
or lower with appropriate  treatment was not to be considered DLT. 
• 
Treatment delay of longer than 14 days. 
•  Asymptomatic  laboratory abnormalities were not to be considered DLTs except for Grade 2 
pancreatitis (enzyme elevation only without clinical and/or radiographic findings). 
Patients were to be followed for survival until the sooner of death, study closure, or up to 2 years after 
enrollment of the last patient. 
All study participants were to be offered the opportunity to participate in an optional LTFU for a least 
10 years after the specific patient’s enrollment to assess safety and survival annually. Patients 
participating in the optional LTFU were to start the first optional LTFU visit 2 years after the specific 
patient’s EOT visit and continue with annual visits until at least 10 years from the date on which the 
patient enrolled. This optional LTFU is intended to assess long-term safety outcomes, including: 
•  Development of any secondary malignancies. 
• 
Treatment-related SAEs. 
•  Cardiovascular function abnormalities. 
•  Ongoing PN assessment. 
•  Development assessment. 
• 
Immune function abnormalities. 
•  Survival status. 
Analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021

As of the 18 December 2020 cutoff for data analysis, all enrolled patients had completed the treatment 
period of the study; and the main study posttreatment follow-up (PTFU) and the LTFU periods were 
ongoing. 
The endpoints that will be analysed for which study population and at which phase of the study are 
descript in the table below (Table 9).  
The populations defined for analysis of the study data were: 
•  Safety population: included patients who received at least 1 dose of any drug in the A+AVD 
regimen. The safety population was used for analysis of safety data, and efficacy endpoints, 
PFS, EFS, OS, and the percentage of patients who received irradiation for HL. 
•  Response-evaluable population (IRF and investigator): included patients who received 
at least 1 dose of A+AVD, had measurable disease at baseline, and at least 1 postbaseline IRF 
and/or investigator disease assessment. The response-evaluable population was defined 
separately for IRF and investigator assessments, and was used for the analysis of ORR,  CR, 
and PR rates, DOR, PET negativity after Cycle 2, and PET negativity after Cycle 6. 
•  PK Population: included patients with sufficient data to enable calculation of at least 1 PK 
parameter.  The PK population was used for PK analyses. 
• 
Immune reconstitution population: included patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug and had a sufficient immune reconstitution blood sampling to allow for immune 
reconstitution evaluation. The immune reconstitution population was used to analyze immune 
reconstitution–related endpoints. 
•  DLT-evaluable population: included patients in the phase 1 study who received at least 1 
dose of protocol therapy and experienced a DLT during the DLT observation period (Cycle 
1+28 days [from first dose through Study Day 56]), and patients who received all planned 
doses of protocol therapy in Cycle 1 and completed all relevant study procedures/assessments 
during the DLT observation period without a DLT. Only patients used to determine the 
recommended dose were included in the DLT-evaluable population.Patients who received G-
CSF during the DLT observation period were excluded from the DLT-evaluable population. 
• 
Immunogenicity population: included patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and had the baseline immunogenicity sample and at least 1 postbaseline immunogenicity 
sample assessment. The immunogenicity population was used for the immunogenicity 
analyses. 
The efficacy analyses were performed for binary and time-to-event endpoints using either the 
response-evaluable or safety populations.

Table 9 Study C25004: Efficacy Endpoints Evaluated 
An interim analysis (IA) for futility was performed after 25 patients had completed 6 cycles of study 
treatment and had their EOT response assessment. The boundary for the futility IA was set to 80%. If 
the upper bound of the 80% CI would have been below 80%, this would mean that A+AVD had an 
inferior efficacy, in terms of ORR,  compared with the known ORR rates of 80% to 90% for the standard 
of care therapies. In addition to the 80% CI, a conventional 95% CI was used for the IA. Following the 
results of the IA, the 80% exact CI of ORR at EOT by IRF assessment was 75%, 96%, while the 95% 
CI was 69%, 97%. Since the upper bounds of both CIs did not cross the predefined futility boundary of 
80%, no futility was inferred and the study continued as planned. Because the study results are 
descriptive, no multiplicity adjustment was done in the final analysis. 
7.2.  Results 
Patient disposition 
A total of 63 subjects were screened to determine eligibility for study enrolment (Table 10). Four 
subjects were determined to be screen failures. One patient was not treatment-naïve (inclusion 
criterion 4), and 1 patient did not meet the prespecified clinical laboratory  values within 4 days of the 
first dose of protocol therapy (inclusion criterion 10). Exclusion criteria that precluded enrollment for 
the other 2 subjects were an active systemic infection that required systemic antibiotic therapy within 
2 weeks of protocol therapy (exclusion criterion 7), and a predefined cardiovascular condition or value 
within 6 months before the first dose of protocol therapy (exclusion criterion 13). 
Fifty-nine patents were enrolled in the study from 4 geographic regions: North America,  Latin America, 
Western Europe, and Asia. A total of 12 patients (20%) were enrolled at 2 investigative sites in the US, 
30 patients (51%) at 6 investigative sites in Brazil, 15 patients (25%) at 4 investigative sites in Italy, 
and 2 patients (3%) at 2 investigative sites in Japan. 
The primary  reason for study treatment discontinuation was reported as completion of the maximum 6 
cycles of protocol therapy for all 59 patients (100%). As of the 18 December 2020 data cut, the study 
was ongoing with patients participating in either PFSFU or overall survival follow-up (OSFU) of the 
main study, and/or the 10-year optional LTFU.

Table 10 Study C25004: Overall Disposition 
According to the predefined criteria outlined in the ICH E3 guidance, protocol deviations were identified 
for 2 patients. One patient was enrolled and allowed to continue participation in the study after the use 
of an excluded CYP3A inhibitor was reported within 2 weeks before the first dose of protocol therapy. 
One patient was enrolled in the study despite an elevated bilirubin value higher than 1 allowed.  
A total of 55 protocol deviations were documented related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote source 
data verification for at least 1 study visit accounted for the highest proportion  (37 deviations [67%]) of 
deviations related to COVID-19. Other COVID-19 deviations pertained to study visits conducted 
remotely,  outside the protocol-defined window, or not conducted altogether. In some instances, PET 
imaging was not performed, and in some instances, the procedure was performed outside the protocol-
defined window.

Phase 1 primary objective; Determination of the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in 
combination with AVD in a paediatric population. 
The DLT-evaluable population consisted of 6 patients treated at the starting dose of brentuximab 
vedotin 48 mg/m2 in combination with AVD during phase 1. No patient met the protocol-defined DLT 
criteria The MTD of brentuximab vedotin was not reached and brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m2 was 
determined to be the RP2D in this paediatric population. 
Phase 1 Secondary Endpoints 
Among the 8-patient phase 1 response-evaluable population, 7 patients (88%) achieved a CR by IRF 
assessment per IWG criteria.  One patient (13%) achieved a PR by IRF assessment per the IWG 
criteria. Every patient (100%) achieved an objective response (either CR or PR) (Table 13). A total of 7 
of 8 patients (88%) in the phase 1 response-evaluable population achieved a return to normal or a 
reduction of their disease’s PET positivity as assessed by Deauville score ≤3 by the end of Cycle 2. 
All patients in the phase 1, response-evaluable population received 6 cycles of protocol therapy and 
had their EOT visit occur after 6 cycles of therapy. 
All 8 patients (100%) in the phase 1, response-evaluable population achieved a return to normal (7 
patients, 88%) or a reduction in Deauville score (1 patient Deauville 5→4, 13%) by their EOT visit.

Phase 1 Exploratory Endpoints 
Median PFS follow-up was 30.03 months (range, 7 [censored]-32 [censored] months) for phase 1 
safety population patients. The median PFS by IRF assessment for the phase 1 safety population was 
not reached (95% CI, 8.97 months–not estimable [NE]), with 2 of 8 patients in the population having 
experienced a PFS event by IRF assessment.  
As all phase 1 (and indeed all study) patients completed 6 cycles of treatment, results for EFS are 
identical to those for PFS, which captured events of disease progression or death. 
No phase 1 patient had died as of the 18 December 2020 data cut-off for this report.  The median OS 
follow-up for the phase 1 safety population patients was 32.28 months (range, 29 [censored]-38 
[censored] months), with all patients alive and remaining in OS follow-up. 
Median DOR follow-up was 28.06 months (range, 5 [censored]-30 [censored] months) for phase 1 
response-evaluable population patients. The median DOR by IRF assessment for the phase 1 response-
evaluable population was not reached (95% CI, 7.26 months-NE), with 8 patients (100%) having 
experienced a response , and 2 patients (25%) having experienced a subsequent disease progression 
event. 
Phase 2 Primary Endpoint 
Of the 51-patient phase 2 response-evaluable population, 38 patients (75%) had achieved a CR at EOT 
by IRF assessment using IWG criteria (95% CI, 60%-86%) (Table 14). Furthermore, 46 patients 
(90%) were PET-negative by IRF assessment (Deauville score ≤3) at the end of Cycle 2. Because 21 
patients (41%) had a Deauville score of 3 at the end of Cycle 2, results differed between the primary 
analysis and sensitivity analysis, with 25 patients (49%) considered PET negative by IRF assessment 
when patients with Deauville scores of 3 were excluded.  
Six patients (12%) had a clinical response of PR at EOT by IRF assessment using IWG criteria (95% 
CI, 4%-24%). In total 44 patients (86%) achieved an objective response (CR or PR) at EOT by IRF 
assessment using IWG criteria (95% CI, 74%-94%).

Assessment (Phase 2 Subset, Response-Evaluable Population) 
All patients in the 51-patient phase 2 safety population (100%) completed 6 cycles of protocol therapy. 
However,  2 patients (4%) in the phase 2 safety population had brentuximab vedotin dose decrements, 
1 of which was due to PN. Thus, 49 of the 51 patients (96%) in the phase 2 safety population 
completed 6 cycles of protocol  therapy at the recommended dose.

Phase 2 Secondary Endpoints 
The 18 December 2020 data cut-off date for this primary  analysis was chosen to correspond to a 
minimum of 15 months PFS follow-up for the majority of patients. At a median PFS follow-up of 17.25 
months, 11 patients (22%) had experienced an event of disease progression; no patient experienced a 
PFS event of death. 
The median duration of PFS was not estimable at this time, with PFS durations ranging from 6 months 
to a censored duration of 28 months (Table 15). As of this analysis, the PFS duration for 9 patients 
(18%) was censored due to receipt of radiotherapy or non-protocol antitumor treatment as frontline 
therapy, as might be expected in this patient population with higher-risk Stage III or IV HL; all other 
patients were either still being followed for PFS or had a PFS event. 
Table 15 Study C25004: PFS per IWG Criteria as Assessed per IRF (Phase 2 Subset, Safety Population) 
Because all phase 2 patients completed 6 cycles of treatment, results for EFS are identical to those for 
PFS.

No phase 2 patient had died as of the 18 December 2020 data cut-off for this report.  As of that time 
the median duration of OS follow-up for the phase 2 safety population patients was 17.71 months 
(range, 13 [censored] to 28 [censored] months). 
With a median follow-up of 15 months for phase 2 response-evaluable population patients for DOR, the 
median DOR per IRF for the phase 2 response-evaluable population was not estimable (95% CI, NE) 
(Figure 10), with 51 patients (100%) having experienced a response per IRF and 11 patients (22%) 
having experienced a subsequent disease progression event.

IRF (Response-Evaluable Population, Subset of Patients With Response) 
Receipt of Irradiation  After Cycle 6 
A total of 13 patients (22%) (95% CI, 12%-35%) in the safety population were reported to have 
received irradiation after Cycle 6. According to the applicant the rate of irradiation in this paediatric 
study exceeded that observed in adults in study C25003 but is lower than that reported for 3 recently 
reported paediatric studies. 
Resolution of B Symptoms 
Resolution was reported for all 23 patients (100%) during treatment for whom at least 1 B symptom 
was reported at baseline. Resolution was reported at a median of 5.14 weeks (range, 0.3-10.1 weeks). 
PRO Results 
HRQOL as measured by the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module was an 
exploratory endpoint in both phase 1 and phase 2. The child and parent completed the questionnaires 
independently. 
Compliance rates for PRO assessments over the course of the study for phase 1 and phase 2 combined 
were high overall for both the child and the parent. This also was true during phase 1 and phase 2. 
During PFSFU, compliance rates for the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the PedsQL 3.0 Cancer 
Module ranged from 81% to 100% for both child and parent. There were too few patients at OSFU to 
make a meaningful assessment of compliance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 47/78 
 
 
 
 
PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale scores generally showed a slight decrease (unfavourable change) from 
baseline to Cycle 5, but returned to baseline levels or higher at EOT, and continued to increase during 
PFSFU, indicating improvement.   
Mean PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module scores generally decreased slightly during the treatment period but 
returned to baseline levels or higher at EOT and PFSFU.  
When PRO was analysed by clinical response (CR or PR), there was a trend of higher mean scores 
(indicating improvement) during the study period through EOT among patients who achieved CR or PR 
than among those who did not.  
When PRO was analysed by selected AEs of special interest (febrile neutropenia and neutropenia) and 
non–AEs of special interest, in general, there was a pattern of a decrease in mean scores from baseline 
to EOT in patients who experienced febrile neutropenia, reflecting an unfavorable effect. Mean scores 
generally returned to baseline levels during the PTFU visits. Mean scores for patients with neutropenia 
or non–AEs of special interest generally appeared to remain more constant from baseline to EOT.

7.3.  Meta-analysis   
The goal of this meta-analysis is to support the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients 
with HL as part of the modified Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
The objective of the targeted literature review (TLR) was to identify studies meeting the eligibility 
criteria for inclusion in a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in 
paediatric patients with HL. 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The identification of studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis (MA) was conducted in three phases with 
the outputs from each phase used to inform subsequent phases of the project. In an initial review of 
potentially relevant trials agreed between Takeda and the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA)/Paediatric Committee (PDCO), a review and extraction of studies reporting eligible data for 
efficacy and safety of BV in paediatric patients with HL was conducted. An additional electronic search 
was conducted to identify any publications associated with the list of trials. The final step was a TLR to 
identify any additional interventional or observational studies meeting the eligibility criteria for 
inclusion in the meta-analysis. 
Electronic database searches were conducted on 28th September  2020 via the OVID platform, using a 
predefined search strategy: 
The following electronic databases were searched via the Ovid platform: 
•  MEDLINE®, incorporating: 
•  MEDLINE®, 1946 to present day 
•  MEDLINE® In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 
•  MEDLINE® Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE® Daily 
•  Embase 1996 to 2020 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 48/78 
 
 
 
The search is designed to identify any interventional (phase II-IV)  trials with a paediatric (aged 5-21 
years) HL population including BV as an intervention in at least one treatment arm. 
Hand searching was used as a supplementary measure to identify further relevant studies. Hand 
searching of selected conference proceedings between 2017–2020 was carried out to identify relevant 
abstracts and posters, which may not have yet been published as a full journal article. The following 
conferences were searched via their respective online platforms or published abstract handbooks: 
•  European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
•  American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
•  American Society of Haematology (ASH)c 
•  European Haematology Association (EHA) 
• 
International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) 
An electronic search was conducted via the OVID platform to identify publications of studies associated 
with the NCT numbers or trial names from the list agreed with PDCO. This electronic search was 
conducted on July 6th, 2020. 
All studies included in the meta-analysis include paediatric patients treated with brentuximab vedotin, 
should have relevant efficacy and safety outcome data and should be a RCTs, nRCTs or observational 
study (Table 16).  
Table 16 Eligibility criteria 
Data from eligible studies were extracted and used to assess the suitability of each study for inclusion 
in the meta-analysis. 
•  Data extraction was conducted by a single analyst, and quality checked by a senior analyst or 
project lead

Out of 23 identified publications (12 unique studies) from the electronic database search, four 
publications were retrospective cohort studies (22-25) and seven studies (18 publications) were phase 
1 or 2 open-label non-randomised trials (either single-arm or dual-arm) (Table 17).  
One further publication was a retrospective series reporting on consecutive patients (no other study 
design details were reported). 
Two non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs) (Hochberg, 2017a, 2017b, 2017c) and Franklin 2018, 
2019) included newly diagnosed/ untreated patients, while a single study included a mixed patient 
population undergoing their first diagnosis or relapse and all remaining studies included patients with 
relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease. 
The median age of recruited patients ranged from 14 years to 17 years and in nine studies a median 
age was not reported. Five studies enrolled young adults as well as paediatric patients but did not 
report findings separately for patients <18 years and those ≥18 years old (Cole, 2018; Harker-Murray 
2019; Hochberg, 2017a, Korsantya, 2020 and McMillan, 2020), and these studies have been excluded 
in a sensitivity analysis, where possible. 
In three studies reporting a monotherapy regimen, the dose of BV was 1.8 mg/kg administered once in 
a 21-day cycle. It was also noted that in a fourth study, monotherapy at a 1.8 mg/kg dose was 
Assessment report

administered following combination treatment and stem cell transplant (SCT). The dose of BV for 
combination treatment regimens were also similar across studies. 
• 
• 
The most common BV dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks (5/10 combination 
therapy studies); 
Two studies reported a 1.2 mg/kg dose of BV every two weeks 4; 
•  One study reported a cumulative dose of 7.8 mg/kg, but not the number of cycles for each 
patient; 
• 
Two studies did not report  BV dose. 
The majority of studies reported between 30% and 70% of patients were male. There were three 
studies lying outside of this range with a particularly high proportion  of males reported by Gulati, 2017 
and Tacyilidiz, 2019 at 80% and 88%, respectively and a low proportion  reported by Faulk 2018 at 
14%. All three studies were observational in design, with very small sample  sizes (between five and 
eight patients).

Feasibility for meta-analysis 
As described in this report,  12 studies from 23 publications were considered suitable to be considered 
for inclusion in MA. Of the 12 studies identified, 11 were included in the analysis, with some caveats: 
•  Six studies (from 12 publications) were only available as conference abstracts and therefore, 
an extensive comparison of baseline characteristics and study quality assessment could not be 
conducted 
• 
There were insufficient studies to use meta-regression to explore whether the difference 
between the studies with respect to the balance of R/R patients will have a significant impact 
on outcomes. Other potential differences between the studies were explored in sensitivity 
analyses. 
There may still be inherent bias in the findings because of the single arm study design of all the 
included studies and that this can limit  the inferences made from the MA results. However,  the analysis 
was a comprehensive pooling of the available data. 
Analysis of outcomes in the combined treatment naïve and relapsed / refractory  populations Overall 
survival (N=3 studies) 
Overall survival was reported in three of the 11 studies for the combined treatment naïve and R/R 
populations. One study treated patients with monotherapy BV, one study treating patients with BV plus 
gemcitabine and the third study treated high risk patients with BV with doxorubicin, vincristine, 
prednisone and darcarbazine (BV-AVPD), and low risk patients with doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
darcarbazine and rituximab (BV-AVD-R). Patient characteristics were similar  between studies, and 
though there were more males recruited in the Locatelli 2018 study (69%) and fewest recruited to 
Hochberg 2017a (35%), the differences may be due to small sample sizes within each study. Overall 
survival at 3, 12 and 24 months was pooled from these studies. 
Overall response rate (N=6 studies) 
Overall response rate was reported  in six of the 11 studies and was defined as the sum of complete 
response (CR) and partial response (PR) in two of the studies; with 100% of patients experiencing a 
CR in 1 study and no specific definition given in the remaining studies. As with OS, the BV treatment 
regimens varied between these studies and this may undermine the validity of any pooled findings, 
patients were treated with, 
•  BV monotherapy in Locatelli 2018 and Koga 2020b 
•  BV + gemcitabine in Cole 2018  
•  High risk patients were treated with BV-AVPD / low risk patients with BV-AVD-R in Hochberg 
•  2017a  
•  BV + bendamustine in McMillan 2020  
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 52/78 
 
 
 
 
•  BV + nivolumab, followed by BV + bendamustine in the NCT02927769 study  
Complete response (N=9 studies) 
Complete response was reported in nine out of the 11 studies. One of the studies reported complete 
metabolic remission, and the Tacyilidiz 2019 abstract only defined the outcome as “remission”. These 
were both assumed to be equivalent to CR reported in the other seven studies in order to include as 
much data as possible. 
Partial response (N=3 studies) 
Partial response was reported in three studies. One study treated patients with BV monotherapy (7), 
one study treating patients with BV plus gemcitabine, while patients in McMillan, 2020 were treated 
with BV plus bendamustine. 
Adverse events 
A wide variety of different adverse events are reported across the studies and thus limited analyses for 
a small number of these were conducted, where feasible.

7.4.  Discussion Efficacy 
As part of this type II variation, intended to update the paediatric data presented in the ADCETRIS 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), results of Study C25004 in paediatric patients with 
previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma  (cHL) are submitted by the MAH. In 
addition a meta-analyses of published clinical studies for brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients 
with Hodgkin lymphoma was submitted.  
Paediatric study C25004 
Study design 
Study C25004 was a phase 1/2, open-label, multiagent, multi-centre study of brentuximab vedotin 
given in combination with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD) in 
paediatric patients with advanced-stage, newly diagnosed classical CD30+ first-line HL. The in this 
study used bretuximab dose was, 48 or 36 mg/m2, to be administered by IV infusion on days 1 and 15 
of each 28 day cycle. 
The use of AVD as back-bone chemotherapy was agreed during a modification of the PIP by the PDCO 
in August 2014. This modification of the PIP was based on positive results obtained in adults with this 
back-bone therapy. Extrapolation of adult data to children in support of results of the paediatric clinical 
study in front line HL was considered easier when the same back-bone chemotherapy for adults and 
the paediatric population would be used.  
ABVD is used in paediatric, adolescent and adult front-line HL setting with similar efficacy and safety of 
other treatment options like BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone), OEPA (vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicine) or OPPA 
(vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, prednisone, doxorubicin). Replacing bleomycin with 
brentuximab vedotin in ABVD therapy could provide clinical benefit to paediatric patients with 
advanced-stage, newly diagnosed cHL when it proofs to decrease the risks of pulmonary toxicity (due 
to bleomycin treatment) and late undesirable effects associated with radiotherapy because it is 
expected that less patients need RT after treatment with brentuximab vedotin than after other 
available treatment regimens. 
The planned dose of brentuximab vedotin in this study was 48 mg/m2 administered Q2W. A BSA-based 
dose of brentuximab vedotin was chosen based on results from the C25002 study and the dose level of 
48 mg/m2 was chosen to match the observed PK exposures in ECHELON-1 for adults. ECHELON-1 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01712490) was a pivotal phase 3, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, global, 
multicenter study, which was designed with the primary  objective of comparing the modified PFS 
obtained with A+AVD versus that obtained with ABVD in adult patients with Stage III or Stage IV cHL. 
The study consisted of 2 phases. Primary Objective of phase 1 was to assess the safety and 
tolerability,  and to identify the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in combination with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 58/78 
 
 
 
 
multiagent chemotherapy regime AVD, in treatment naïve paediatric HL. Secondary endpoints of this 
study phase include PK assessment, and efficacy endpoints like CR, PR ORR, PET negative after 2 and 
6 treatment cycles, and development of ADA. Exploratory endpoints include PFS, EFS, OS and DOR. 
Primary  Objective of phase 2 was to determine efficacy including CR rate, percentage of patients who 
were PET negative after cycle 2, to evaluate PR and OR rate at the end of protocol therapy and to 
determine the percentage of patients who were able to complete 6 cycles of protocol therapy. 
Secondary endpoints include among others, PFS, EFS, OS, DOR, development of ADA and safety.  
The paediatric study population consisted of patients aged 5 to < 18 years with advanced-stage (Stage 
III or Stage IV), newly diagnosed CD30+ cHL who were treatment naïve and had a Karnofsky 
Performance Status or Lansky Play-Performance of ≥50. 
Primary  and secondary endpoints were in accordance with what was agreed by PDCO, and are 
commonly used endpoints for oncology studies. However, given the single arm design of study 
C25004, interpretation of time dependent endpoints like PFS, EFS and OS is hampered. The single arm 
clinical study in children with newly diagnosed high risk HL was agreed by the PDCO, as it was believed 
that the paediatric indication could be supported by extrapolation of adult data to children. Although 
some differences between paediatric and adults HL were acknowledged (for instance differences in 
prevalence), the treatment strategy does not differ, and extrapolation of efficacy should be attempted.  
In the current variation, the concept of extrapolation of adults data to children was not discussed. Also 
the efficacy results have not been contextualized e.g. using external and/or historical controls. For the 
purpose of this variation, noting that the MAH does not seek a paediatric indication, this can be 
agreed. If in the future the applicant applies for a paediatric indication the extrapolating of adult data 
to children needs to be attempted, and contextualising study data with historical controls needs to be 
performed.  
Results 
In total 59 patients were included in study C25004, 8 in phase 1 and 51 in phase 2 of the study. This is 
only a limited number of patients. In principle, the preformed meta-analysis could provide support for 
observations of this study in treatment naïve paediatric HL.  However, the MAH did not discuss to what 
extent results of the meta-analysis are relevant for the C25004 study. If in the future the applicant 
applies for a paediatric indication, a discussion on how the meta-analyses data compare to the C25004 
study results, taking into account impact of differences in patient population and treatment, should be 
included. 
The DLT-evaluable population consisted of 6 patients treated at the starting dose of brentuximab 
vedotin 48 mg/m2 in combination with AVD during phase 1. No patient met the protocol-defined DLT 
criteria. The MTD of brentuximab vedotin was not reached and brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m2 was 
determined to be the RP2D in this paediatric population. 
Among the 8-patient phase 1 response-evaluable population, 7 patients (88%) achieved a CR by IRF 
assessment per IWG criteria.  One patient (13%) achieved a PR by IRF assessment per the IWG 
criteria. Every patient (100%) achieved an objective response (either CR or PR). A total of 7 of 8 
patients (88%) in the phase 1 response-evaluable population achieved a return to normal or a 
reduction of their disease’s PET positivity as assessed by Deauville score ≤3 by the end of Cycle 2. 
After a median PFS follow-up was 30.03 months, the median PFS was not reached. Two of the 8 
patients in the population have experienced a PFS event. After a median OS follow of 32.28 months, 
no patient had died.  
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 59/78 
 
 
 
Of the 51-patient phase 2 response-evaluable population, 38 patients (75%) had achieved a CR. 
Furthermore, 46 patients (90%) were PET-negative by IRF assessment (Deauville score ≤3) at the end 
of Cycle 2. Six patients (12%) had a clinical response of PR. In total 44 patients (86%) achieved an 
objective response (CR or PR). With a median follow-up of 15 months the median DOR was not 
estimable. 
A total of 13 patients (22%) (95% CI, 12%-35%) in the safety population were reported to have 
received irradiation after Cycle 6. According to the applicant the rate of irradiation in this paediatric 
study exceeded that observed in adults in study C25003, but is lower than that reported for 3 recently 
reported paediatric studies. However,  the number of patients included in C25004 is small,  by which no 
definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the exact percentage of patients who need of RT after 
brentuximab-vedotin+AVD treatment.  
At a median PFS follow up of 17.25 months, the median duration of PFS was not estimable, reported 
PFS durations ranged from 6 months to a censored duration of 28 months. Eleven patients (22%) had 
experienced an event of disease progression; no patient experienced a PFS event of death. At 12 
months about 74% of the patients had not had a PFS event. Available PFS data suggest that the PFS 
curve reached a plateau after 15 months of follow up, however longer follow up would be needed for 
confirmation.  
The single arm study design hampers the interpretation of the study results which is especially true for 
the time dependent efficacy endpoints like PFS, EFS and OS. Given the generally good prognosis and 
long survival of paediatric HL patients treated with currently available chemotherapeutic options, the 
follow-up time is too short to draw any conclusion. The high response rate indicates significant anti-
tumour activity and the percentage of patients who had no PFS, EFS or OS event at specific time 
points might give point towards a clinically relevant effect of treatment, however for this the results 
should be contextualized and supported by extrapolation of adult efficacy data to children. Of note, 
given the prognosis, updated data would be needed. Potentially this will be provided by the optional 
LTFU in Study C25004 that provides an opportunity for patients to participate in a longer duration of 
PTFU monitoring for assessment of long-term safety endpoints and survival status. However, patients 
can choose to enter the LTFU study, this might introduce bias in the long-term follow up data, when 
patients with PD appear to be less likely to enter the LTFU study in comparison to patients who have 
no PD.  
While in the agreed PIP it is noted that the A+AVD indication for peadiatric treatment naïve cHL might 
be supported by extrapolation from adult data, a general statement that response rates, PFS, EFS and 
OS were generally consistent between adult patients (study C25003 [ECHELON-1]) and paediatric 
patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV cHL (study C25004) is not sufficient for this purpose. 
Meta-analysis 
The identification of studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis (MA) an electronic database search was 
conducted via the Ovid platform. Followed by hand searching to identify further relevant studies which 
had not yet been published as a full journal article (e.g. conferences were searched via their respective 
online platforms or published abstract handbooks). Finally, data from eligible studies were extracted 
and used to assess the suitability of each study for inclusion in the meta-analysis. 
Inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis were; studies needed to include paediatric patients who were 
treated with brentuximab vedotin and studies needed to have relevant efficacy and safety outcome 
data and should be a RCTs, nRCTs or observational study.

Twenty-three publications, reporting the findings of 12 unique studies, met the inclusion criteria.  Of 
these, 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses, nine for the efficacy outcome analyses and 11 
for the exploratory safety outcome analyses. 
Two trials (Hochberg, 2017a, 2017b, 2017c and Franklin 2018, 2019) included newly diagnosed/ 
untreated patients, while a single study included a mixed patient population undergoing treatment 
following their first diagnosis or relapse (Titapiwatanakun, 2019) and all remaining studies included 
patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease.  
The following efficacy outcomes were analysed based on available data: OS (data available from 3 
studies); ORR (data available from 6 studies); CR (data available from 9 studies) and PR (data 
available from 3 studies). Exploratory safety analyses were also conducted. 
The efficacy analyses results for brentuximab vedotin, showed an estimated 96.9% of patients were 
alive at 3 months; 91% at 12 months and 87% at 24 months in the meta-analysis (corresponding to 
basecase results (of all studies combined) in the provided tables and figures). 
For response outcomes, an estimated 79% of patients achieved a response, with the majority of these 
experiencing a CR as best response outcome. A separate calculation for CR, based on more study data 
than was available for ORR suggested that around 73% of patients achieve CR when treated with BV. 
PR was only reported in three studies (a subgroup of those reporting CR) and the analysis suggested 
14% of patients experience a PR, in addition to the >70% experiencing a CR. [Note that ORR is not 
equal to CR+PR because not all studies reported PR].  
As most of the studies included in the meta-analysis include relapsed/refractory patients, the value of 
this analysis to support the efficacy data of study C25004 in patients that includes previously 
untreated high risk HL patients, is not immediately evident. Only 2 of the studies included in the meta-
analysis newly diagnosed/ untreated patients. The applicant did not discuss whether efficacy results of 
these studies were comparable  to the efficacy results obtained with study C25004, or whether even it 
would be feasible to compare  the study results given the treatment including the back bone 
chemotherapy, and the patient populations included in the studies.  
Conclusion  
Results of the small clinical study C25004 show high response rates with brentuximab vedotin in 
paediatric patients with newly diagnosed HL.CR rate was above 75%. The discussed limitations of the 
submitted data (i.e. lack of contextualisation of the single arm C25004 trial data, no discussion 
regarding extrapolation from adults data and no discussion on how the meta-analysis data can support 
the C25004 results) are not a concern for this variation aiming to include a limited selection of the 
available paediatric data in SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.  
However,  if in the future the applicant intends to apply for a paediatric (first line) indication, these 
above mentioned limitations need to be addressed.  
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
Exposure 
The safety population consisted of 59 patients who received at least 1 dose of any drug in the A+AVD 
regimen. All treated patients completed the maximum 6 cycles of protocol therapy. Patients treated in 
this study received a median of 6 cycles (range, 6-6 cycles) of each of the 4 components of the 
protocol therapy (A+AVD), administered over a median of 25.29 weeks (range, 23.7-31.1 weeks). 
Median RDI for each component of the A+AVD regimen was 99.9% (range, 87.89%-103.18%) for 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021

brentuximab vedotin, 99.9% (range, 74.65%-103.11%) for doxorubicin, 99.7% (range, 78.07%-
102.88%) for vinblastine, and 99.9% (range, 91.92%-108.28%) for dacarbazine. 
A dose delay was the most frequently reported treatment modification for patients in the safety 
population. At least 1 dose delay for each component of the A+AVD regimen was reported for 43 
patients (73%) in the safety population. A brentuximab vedotin dose reduction and dose interruption 
were reported for 3 patients each (5%), and a dose hold was reported for 1 patient 2%). Within the 
AVD regimen, a dose reduction for doxorubicin was reported for 1 patient (2%), for vinblastine for 4 
patients (7%), and for dacarbazine for 3 patients (5%). A dose interruption for dacarbazine was 
reported for 2 patients (3%). 
Summary of AEs 
At least 1 TEAE of any grade was reported for all 59 patients (100%) and at least 1 drug-related TEAE 
of any grade for 57 patients (97%) in the safety population (Table 26). At least 1 Grade 3 or higher 
TEAE was reported for 54 patients (92%) and was considered drug related for 51 patients (86%). At 
least 1 SAE was reported for 24 patients (41%) and was considered drug related for 19 patients 
(32%). No AEs were reported that resulted in the premature and permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment, and no on-study deaths were reported in the study.

At least 1 Grade 4 TEAE reported for 44 patients (75%). Grade 4 neutropenia was the most commonly 
reported Grade 4 TEAE PT. Grade 4 neutropenia was reported for 30 patients (51%), Grade 4 
neutrophil count decreased for 16 patients (27%), and Grade 4 WBC count decreased for 12 patients 
(20%). Grade 4 lymphocyte count decreased was reported for 2 patients (3%). Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia, leukopenia, mucosal inflammation, sepsis, and decubitus ulcer were reported for 1 
patient each (2%). 
SAEs 
At least 1 SAE was reported for 24 patients (41%) in the safety population. Febrile neutropenia was 
the most commonly reported SAE. Febrile neutropenia was reported for 17% of patients, and 
neutropenia and vomiting were reported for 5% of patients each (Table 29).

Other SAEs by Age Group 
Treatment-emergent SAEs are presented for patients by age group. Febrile neutropenia was the most 
commonly reported SAE for both age groups.  
At least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was reported for 3 patients (27%) in the patient cohort aged 5 to 
11 years. Febrile neutropenia was reported as an SAE for 2 patients (18%), and anaemia, pyrexia, 
pneumothorax, and GI disorder were reported as an SAE for 1 patient each in this patient cohort (9%). 
At least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was reported for 21 patients (44%) in the patient cohort aged 12 
to 17 years. Febrile neutropenia was reported as an SAE for 8 patients (17%), vomiting and 
neutropenia were reported as an SAE for 3 patients each (6%), and sepsis, constipation, and nausea 
were reported as SAEs for 2 patients each (4%) in this patient cohort. 
AEs That Resulted in Dose Modification 
At least 1 dose reduction was reported for 3 patients (5%), at least 1 dose delay for 43 patients 
(73%), and at least 1 dose interruption for 2 patients (3%). 
The AE PTs that led to dose reduction were peripheral sensory neuropathy (2 patients), and weight 
decreased (1 patient). 
Neutropenia was the most commonly reported TEAE PT that led to dose delay, followed by neutrophil 
count decreased, vomiting, WBC count decreased, pyrexia, and febrile neutropenia, and stomatitis, 
leukopenia, and herpes zoster.  
An AE led to dose interruption for 2 patients (3%). Grade 3 hypoxia, and Grade 1 dyspnoea and 
vomiting were reported for 1 patient each. 
AEs of special interest 
Neutropenia

was reported for 52 patients (88%) in the safety population. Grade 4 neutropenia was reported for 44 
patients (75%) and Grade 3 neutropenia for 7 patients (12%). Neutropenia was reported as an SAE for 
4 patients (7%). 
Febrile Neutropenia 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported for 10 patients (17%) in the safety population. 
A dose delay for febrile neutropenia was reported for 4 patients (7%). 
The use of CSFs as a prophylactic strategy can reduce both the severity and duration of neutropenia, 
and the risk of febrile neutropenia associated with chemotherapy. 
Onset of febrile neutropenia was reported for the safety population at a median of 46.5 days (range, 9-
158 days) after the first dose of protocol therapy, and resolution at a median of 4 days (range, 0-13 
days) after onset.  
The administration of G-CSFs was allowed in this study, except during the DLT observation period in 
phase 1 because the assessment of DLTs and determination of the RP2D could be confounded by G-
CSF usage. 
G-CSF administration was reported for 37 patients (63%) in the safety population with the first G-CSF 
dose administered at a median of 17 days (range, 8-149 days) after the first dose of protocol  therapy. 
G-CSF usage was reported for 7 patients (64%) in the patient cohort aged 5 to 11 years and for a total 
of 30 patients (63%) aged 12 to 17 years.  
Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) 
A comprehensive review of PTs under the PN (SMQ) (MedDRA Version 23.0) broad was performed to 
assess the frequency and severity of PN reported in the study. The PN (SMQ) included PTs for both 
sensory and motor neuropathy and terms that had both sensory and motor components. An SSQ was 
performed to categorize treatment-emergent PN events into peripheral sensory neuropathy and PMN 
PTs. 
At least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported for 14 patients (24%), and 
was considered drug related for 12 patients (20%) in the safety population. 
At least 1 peripheral  sensory neuropathy (SSQ) event of any grade was reported for 11 patients (19%) 
and at least 1 PMN (SSQ) event for 5 patients (8%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy, reported for 5 
patients (8%), was the most commonly reported PT in the peripheral sensory neuropathy (SSQ). 
Muscular weakness and PMN, reported for 3 patients each (5%), were the most commonly reported 
PTs in the PMN (SSQ). 
At least 1 PN (SMQ) event of any grade was considered drug related for 12 patients (20%) in the 
safety population.  
Among patients for whom at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade was reported, 
onset of the first PN event was reported at a median of 5.93 weeks (range, 0.9-19.9 weeks), and 
onset of a Grade 2 PN event (the highest grade) at a median of 6.86 weeks (range, 0.9-19.9 weeks) 
after the first dose of protocol therapy. 
Resolution of all PN events was reported for 9 patients (64%) at EOT, and for 11 patients (79%) the 
time of last follow-up for the 14 patients for whom at least 1 PN (SMQ) event was reported during 
treatment. Resolution of at least 1 PN event was reported at a median of 1.57 weeks (range, 0.3-50.3 
weeks) for the 14 patients for whom at least 1 PN (SMQ) event was reported in the study.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Serum Chemistry 
A postbaseline shift from CTC Grade 0 to Grade 4 hypercalcemia was reported for 4 patients (7%), 
hyperuricemia for 3 patients (5%), hypocalcemia for 2 patients (3%), and hypoglycemia and increased 
creatinine for 1 patient each (2%). A postbaseline shift from CTC Grade 0 to Grade 3 increased ALT, 
AST, and hypophosphatemia was reported for 3 patients each (5%), and to hyponatremia for 1 patient 
(2%) in the safety population.  
Hematology 
A postbaseline shift from CTC Grade 0 to Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased was reported for 44 
patients (75%), WBC count decreased for 15 patients (25%), platelet count decreased for 4 patients 
(7%), and lymphocyte count decreased for 2 patients (4%) in the safety population. 
Post baseline shift from CTC Grade 0 to Grade 3 WBC count decreased was reported for 19 patients 
(32%), neutrophil count decreased for 9 patients (15%), lymphocyte count decreased for 5 patients 
(9%), and leukocytosis, platelet count decreased, and lympocyte count increased for 1 patient each 
(2%). 
8.1.  Meta-analysis  Safety 
Six studies reported treatment-related adverse events. Korsantya 2020 (27) reported that 3 patients 
experienced haematological toxicity and 1 patient experienced infection-related complications, but it is 
unclear whether these were the only adverse events experienced by the study patients. Thus, this 
study has been excluded from the analysis of this outcome, due to the lack of clarity. A summary of 
total AEs data reported in the five included studies is presented in Table 30.

Paediatric study C25004 
The safety population consisted of 59 patients who received at least 1 dose of any drug in the A+AVD 
regimen. All treated patients completed the maximum 6 cycles of protocol therapy (A+AVD). 
At least 1 TEAE of any grade was reported for all 59 patients (100%) and at least 1 drug-related TEAE 
of any grade for 57 patients (97%) in the safety population. At least 1 Grade 3 or higher TEAE was 
reported for 54 patients (92%) and was considered drug-related for 51 patients (86%). At least 1 SAE 
was reported for 24 patients (41%) and was considered drug-related for 19 patients (32%). No AEs 
were reported that resulted in the premature and permanent discontinuation of study treatment, and 
no on-study deaths were reported in the study. 
The TEAE PTs of any grade reported for at least 20% of patients in the safety population were vomiting 
(85% of patients); nausea (75%); neutropenia (58%); pyrexia and WBC count decreased (42% each); 
abdominal pain (39%); constipation, neutrophil count decreased, and stomatitis (37% each); 
headache (32%); anaemia, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, and back pain (24% each); oropharyngeal 
pain and weight decreased (22% each); and fatigue (20%). 
At least 1 Grade 3 or higher TEAE was reported for 54 patients (92%) in the safety population. The

reported for 30 patients (51%), Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased for 16 patients (27%), and Grade 
4 WBC count decreased for 12 patients (20%). Grade 4 lymphocyte count decreased was reported for 
2 patients (3%). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, mucosal inflammation, sepsis, and decubitus 
ulcer were reported for 1 patient each (2%). 
At least 1 SAE was reported for 24 patients (41%) in the safety population. Febrile neutropenia was 
the most commonly reported SAE. Febrile neutropenia was reported for 17% of patients, and 
neutropenia and vomiting were reported for 5% of patients each. 
PN is a well characterized adverse drug reaction for brentuximab vedotin. At least 1 PN (SMQ) event of 
any grade was reported for 14 patients (24%) in the safety population. A Grade 2 PN (SMQ) event (the 
highest severity reported in the study) was reported for 3 patients (5%), and a PN (SMQ) event led to 
dose reduction for 2 patients (3%). The PT, PMN was reported as an SAE for 1 patient (2%). 
Resolution of all PN events was reported for most patients for whom at least 1 PN (SMQ) event was 
reported during treatment. At the time of the last follow-up, resolution of all PN events was reported 
for 11 patients (79%) among the 14 patients for whom at least 1 PN event was reported. Resolution of 
at least 1 PN event was reported at a median of 1.57 weeks (range, 0.3-50.3 weeks). 
At least 1 TEAE that was considered infusion related was reported for 5 patients (8%) in the safety 
population. All 5 patients were ADA negative at all post baseline time points. No IRRs were reported 
for 4 patients who were reported to be transiently ADA positive with low ADA titers. 
No additional safety signals were identified from the results of clinical laboratory data, vital signs 
assessments, or ECG results. 
The applicant concluded that A+AVD had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated in this 
pediatric population of treatment-naïve patients with advanced (Stage III or Stage IV) CD30+ cHL. No 
new adverse drug reactions were observed in the pediatric population receiving the A+AVD 
combination. 
Safety data for subgroups including patients 5-11 years of age and patients 12-17 years of age was 
provided. The toxicity profile of brentuximab-vedotin seemed to be similar  across these age groups. It 
was stated that safety data in children was comparable  to the known safety profile in adults, however 
potentially important similarities  and differences were not thoroughly discussed. When the applicant 
will apply for a paediatric indication this comparison of adult and paediatric safety data should be 
further discussed.  
In the PIP summary reports,  it was suggested that the main benefit of brentuximab vedotin+ AVD for 
the paediatric population might be decrease of toxicity including pulmonary toxicity, in comparison to 
other used chemotherapy regimens. Due to the nature of the indirect comparison, it will be difficult to 
draw robust conclusion on the comparison of safety profiles for different first line treatment options for 
paediatric HL patients. Moreover, without all safety data of different treatment regimens and different 
populations the suggestions of a safety benefit for brentuximab vedotin+ AVD cannot be supported.  
Furthermore, long term safety data for brentuximab vedotin+AVD is not yet available, therefore no 
conclusion can be drawn with regard to its long-term toxicity in paediatric population. Potentially the 
optional LTFU in Study C25004 will provide in due time additional long-term safety endpoints. 
Meta-analysis 
The safety analysis for the meta-analysis are only considered exploratory.  In general, the 
heterogeneity between the studies was high. The exploratory  analysis, conducted for safety outcomes, 
estimated that 73% of patients experienced a treatment-related AE of any grade. Around 35% of 
patients experienced a grade 3-4 AE and 42% an SAE. An estimated 25% of patients experienced

grade 3-4 neutropenia. 
The sensitivity analyses for safety outcomes showed some variation in the exact proportions of 
patients estimated to experience an AE, however on the whole, findings were consistent with the 
basecase. The sensitivity analysis focusing on studies evaluating brentuximab- vedotin as a 
combination therapy was not intuitive and suggested that patients receiving combination therapy may 
experience slightly lower odds of experiencing a treatment-related AE, or a grade 3-4 AE, and similar 
odds of experiencing grade 3-4 neutropenia. This is clearly a reflection of the differences between 
study characteristics amongst the studies that impacted the outcome when monotherapy studies were 
removed and was (could not be) adjusted for. 
Except for neutropenia the incidence of specific AEs were not analysed. The meta-analysis includes 
studies in which brentuximab is used in different combinational treatment regimens at different doses 
and in different patient populations (most patients with r/r disease). The sensitivity analysis that 
include studies sharing specific characteristic with regard to treatment or patients population, generally 
include only few studies. Considering all above the value of this meta-analysis in support of the safety 
profile of brentuximab vedotin-AVD combination therapy in newly diagnosed paediatric HL patients, is 
limited.  
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to safety: 
- When available the long term safety data need to be submitted (OC).

PRAC Rapporteur's assessment:  
The proposed updates in the RMP covers the removal  of C25004 study as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. This study is a phase I/II, open-label study of brentuximab vedotin + Adriamycin®, vinblastine, 
and dacarbazine in pediatric patients with advanced stage newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma.  This 
study was added to the RMP in order to address the safety concerns related to “safety in pediatrics” 
and “thymus depletion (pediatric)”. As a result of completion of the study, the risk of “thymus 
depletion (paediatric)” has been removed as an important potential risk from the safety specifications 
and the risk minimization measures of the RMP. The MAH stated that important potential risk of 
“thymus depletion (paediatric)” is being removed after the completion of 2 paediatric studies, C25002 
(completed in 2017) and C25004. No evidence of such risk was identified from the analysing the 
immune reconstitution data, or the safety data in clinical trials and post-marketing reports. Note that 
the recent review of the important  potential risk of “thymus depletion (pediatric)” in the latest PSUR 
covering the period of 18/02/2020 to 18/02/2021 concluded that no new safety concern was identified. 
There have been no reports of pediatric thymus depletion in any patient treated with brentuximab 
vedotin. The updates are therefore accepted, provided that the MAH routinely review the risk of 
"thymus depletion (paediatric)" as safety concerns of the PSUR.   
Other updates include updates related to the epidemiology of HL and frontline treatment, clinical trial 
exposure with a DLP 18
February
2021, post authorisation experience with a DLP 18-February-2021 
and removal of paediatric patients from the list of "populations not studied", which are accepted.

Overall conclusion on the RMP  
The changes to the RMP are acceptable, provided that the MAH maintains "thymus depletion 
(paediatric)" as an important potential risk in the summary of safety concerns of the PSUR and 
provides reviews accordingly. 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated as proposed  
below. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Proposed SmPC Changes 
•  Section 4.2, Posology and method of administration, Dose Adjustments, Paediatric population 
subsection, was modified to refer to observations from Study C25004, including deletion of text 
from this subsection relating to thymus depletion in nonclinical studies as thymus depletion was 
not observed in paediatric studies C25002 and C25004. Throughout section 4.2, the 
recommendation for use of G-CSF was clarified to apply to adult patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 75/78 
 
 
 
 
•  Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, Immunogenicity was modified to add a subsection describing 
observations in paediatric patients in Study C25004. 
•  Section 4.8, Undesirable effects, Paediatric Population was enlarged to report safety observations 
from study C25004. 
•  Section 5.1, Pharmacodynamic properties,  Clinical efficacy, Paediatric Population was enlarged to 
include a subsection describing efficacy data for study C25004. Also in the section, a statement 
describing the deferral of paediatric studies as these have now completed. 
•  Section 5.2, Pharmacokinetic properties,  Paediatric Population, was modified to describe ADC and 
MMAE exposures observed in paediatric patients with BSA-based dosing. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
11.  Request for supplementary information 
11.1.  Other  concerns 
Clinical  aspects 
1)  The MAH is requested to correct Table 3f of the clinical summary 2.7.2. It is preferred to 
express Cmax and Cmin of MMAE in ng/ml unit and not in µM unit. 
2)  The text in section 5.2 of the SmPC should be amended to report the pharmacokinetics of ADC 
and MMAE as determined by non-compartmental analysis (see separate SmPC document). 
3)  Long term safety data for brentuximab vedotin+AVD is not yet available.  The MAH should 
commit to submit the long term safety data when available. 
12.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
12.1.  Other  concerns 
Clinical  aspects 
Question 1 
The MAH is requested to correct Table 3f of the clinical summary 2.7.2. It is preferred  to express Cmax 
and Cmin of MMAE in ng/ml unit and not in μM unit.  
Summary of the MAH’s response  
Please refer below to an updated version of Table 3.f from the Summary  of Clinical Pharmacology 
(module 2.7.2), in which Cmax values for both Study C25002 and C25004 have been corrected, with 
corrections displayed in red bold for convenience. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021  
Page 76/78 
 
 
 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
The popPK simulated Cmax values of MMAE have been corrected and the Table in the report has been 
replaced by this corrected Table.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
The text in section 5.2 of the SmPC should be amended to report the pharmacokinetics of ADC and 
MMAE as determined by non-compartmental analysis.  
“Please, report  ADC and MMAE exposure parameter values as determined in the noncompartmental 
analysis. The variability in the popPK  was considerably higher than the observed non-compartmental 
data. Currently the model is considered suitable for descriptive purposes only, and not for simulation 
purposes (see report).  Reference to simulated dosing of 72 mg/m2 Q3W and comparison with adults 
data should be deleted.” 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The marketing authorization holder (MAH) has amended Section 5.2 as agreed.  The MAH accepts and 
has removed the strikethrough of the C25002 pharmacokinetics (PK) data.  
The MAH further accepts and proposes to add the ADC and MMAE exposure parameter values as 
determined in the non-compartmental analysis from the clinical study report  for Study C25004 as 
follows: 
The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE following a 30-minute intravenous 
infusion of BV administered at 48 mg/m2 every 2 weeks in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
and dacarbazine (AVD) were evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical trial of 59 paediatric patients (6-17 years 
Assessment report  
EMA/754188/2021

of age) with advanced-stage newly diagnosed CD30+ classical Hodgkin lymphoma (children aged 6-11 
years, n = 11 and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, n = 48). The Cmax of ADC occurred in serum 
approximately  at the end of infusion and declined in a multiexponential manner with a terminal half-life 
of approximately  4 days. The Cmax of MMAE occurred in plasma approximately  2 days following BV 
administration with a half-life of approximately  2 days. Geometric mean Cmax and AUC of ADC 
following a single 48 mg/m2 dose were 22.5 μg/mL and 46.7 μg*day/mL, respectively. Geometric 
mean Cmax and AUC of MMAE following a single 48 mg/m2 dose were 4.9 ng/mL and 27.2 ng*day/mL, 
respectively. Similar  ADC exposures were achieved following body surface area-based dosing of BV at 
48 mg/m2 in combination with AVD among pediatric age groups (<12 years, 12 – 16 years and >16 
years). 
Last, the MAH also accepts deletion of the text that references the simulated dosing of 72 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks in pediatric patients and its comparison with the adult data. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The applicant has amended the SmPC as requested, however the information with the popPK  analysis 
has not been deleted. The applicant is kindly requested to delete the last paragraph of section 5.2 
“Population pharmacokinetics….. in combination with AVD.. 
Updated assessment  
The last paragraph of section 5.2 has been deleted as requested. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved  
Question 3  
Long term safety data for brentuximab vedotin+AVD is not yet available.  The MAH should commit to 
submit the long term  safety data when available. 
Company Response  
The MAH agrees to provide long-term follow up data on Study C25004 when available.  Reporting of 
study data after a minimum  of 10 years’ follow-up for all consenting patients is projected to occur by 
31 March 2030. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The applicant has agreed to submit in due time the 10 year follow up data.  
Conclusion 
Issue is resolved.  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

1.  Introduction 
On 10 October 2016, the MAH submitted data from paediatric patients included in  
Study CCHI621ADE04: A multicenter, open-label, randomized, two arm study to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of a therapy avoiding intraoperative steroids in combination with Simulect®, 
Sandimmun®/ Sandimmun® Optoral and steroids in pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients  
(SINTRA) 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
A short Critical Expert Overview has also been provided. The MAH states that the submitted paediatric 
study does not modify the benefit-risk assessment of Simulect in the approved indication and that 
therefore no consequential regulatory action is required. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Product 
Basiliximab is a murine/human chimeric monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ) that is directed against the 
interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25 antigen), which is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes 
in response to antigenic challenge. It specifically binds with high affinity to the CD25 antigen on 
activated T-lymphocytes expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor and thereby prevents 
binding of interleukin-2, the signal for T-cell proliferation. 
Authorisation details 
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for 
Simulect to Novartis Europharm Limited on 9 October 1998. The approval to market a medicine in one, 
several or all European Union Member States. was renewed on 9 October 2003 and on 9 October 2008. 
Therapeutic Indications 
Simulect is indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal 
transplantation in adult and paediatric patients (1-17 years). It is to be used concomitantly with 
ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in 
patients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive 
regimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
Clinical studies 
The efficacy of basiliximab in prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo renal transplantation has

been demonstrated in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Results from two pivotal 12-month 
multicentre studies (722 patients in total) comparing basiliximab with placebo show that basiliximab, 
used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids, significantly reduces the 
incidence of acute rejection episodes both within 6 (31% vs. 45%, p<0.001) and 12 (33% vs. 48%, 
p<0.001) months after transplantation. There was no significant difference between basiliximab and 
placebo-treated patients in graft survival after 6 and 12 months (at 12 months 32 graft losses on 
basiliximab (9%) and 37 graft losses on placebo (10%)). The incidence of acute rejection episode was 
substantially lower in patients receiving basiliximab and a triple drug immunosuppressive regimen. 
Results from two multicentre double-blind studies comparing basiliximab with placebo (463 patients 
in total) show that basiliximab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes within 
6 months after transplantation when used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion, 
corticosteroids, and either azathioprine (21% vs. 35%) or mycophenolate mofetil (15% vs. 27%). 
Graft loss occurred in 6% of basiliximab-treated and 10% of placebo-treated patients by 6 months. 
The adverse event profile remained comparable between treatment groups. 
In a pooled analysis of two five-year open-label extension studies (586 patients total) the combined 
graft and patient survival rates were not statistically different for the basiliximab and placebo groups. 
Extension studies also showed that patients who experienced an acute rejection episode during the 
first year after transplantation experienced more graft losses and deaths over the five-year follow-up 
period than patients who had no rejection. These events were not influenced by basiliximab. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of basiliximab were evaluated in two paediatric studies. 
Basiliximab was used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion and steroids in an 
uncontrolled study in 41 paediatric de novo renal transplant recipients. Acute rejection occurred in 
14.6% of patients by 6 months post-transplantation, and in 24.3% by 12 months. Overall the adverse 
event profile was consistent with general clinical experience in the paediatric renal transplantation 
population and with the profile in the controlled adult transplantation studies. 
A 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre study investigated 
basiliximab in combination with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids 
in paediatric renal allograft recipients. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate 
superiority of this combination versus treatment with ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate 
mofetil and steroids in the prevention of acute rejections. Of the 202 patients, 104 were randomised to 
basiliximab and 98 to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint, time to first biopsy-proven acute 
rejection (BPAR) episode or treatment failure defined as graft loss, death or presumptive rejection 
within the first 6 months post transplantation, occurred in 16.7% of basiliximab-treated patients and 
21.7% of placebo-treated patients. When borderline rejections were included in the primary efficacy 
endpoint, the rates were 26.0% and 23.9% respectively, with no statistically significant difference 
between the basiliximab- and placebo-treated groups (HR: 1.04, 90% CI: [0.64; 1.68]). The rates of 
BPAR were 9.4% in the basiliximab group and 17.4% in the placebo group (HR: 0.50, 90% CI: [0.25; 
0.99]). When borderline rejections were included, the rates were 20.8% and 19.6% respectively (HR:

1.01, 90% CI: [0.59; 1.72]). The overall safety profiles were similar in both groups. The incidence 
rates of adverse events and the pattern of adverse events were comparable between the two 
treatment groups and to be expected for the treatment regimens and the underlying diseases. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Simulect® (not registered for pediatric de novo liver transplant patients) was part of the triple-
immunosupression therapy regimen, which was investigated during the study period and was therefore 
defined as study medication. Simulect® (10 mg) was supplied as a lyophilisate in vials with ampoules 
of sterile water for injection (5 mL) and had to be given of 10 mg (body weight <35 kg) or 20 mg 
(body weight ≥35 kg) strength. The first dose had to be given on day 0 within 8 hours of reperfusion of 
the graft. The second dose had to be given on the morning of day 4. Each dose was administered by 
i.v. bolus injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
As part of a remediation exercise, which reviewed all interventional and non-interventional studies with 
pediatric patients in scope of the Article 46 requirement, the Simulect study CCHI621ADE04 (SINTRA 
study) has been identified for an Article 46 submission. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Study CCHI621ADE04 (SINTRA-Study) was a German multicenter, open-label, randomized, two 
arm study comparing the efficacy and safety of a regimen combining Simulect®, Sandimmun®/ 
Sandimmun® Neoral (named Sandimmun Optoral® in Germany) and steroids with and without 
intraoperative steroids in pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients. 
First patient recruited: 20 March 2004 
Last patient completed: 09 March 2009 
A total of 77 patients were enrolled (37 males, 40 females). Patients' mean age (±SD) was 3.4 ± 4.7 
years and 58.4% belonged to the stratum <2 years. A total of 73 patients received two doses of

Study design 
This was a national, 6 months, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the effect and 
safety of a therapy regimen with versus without intraoperative steroids in combination with Simulect®, 
Sandimmun®/Sandimmun® Optoral and steroids in pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients. 
A total of 80 patients were planned to be enrolled. After a screening visit the patients’ randomization 
was performed before transplantation (day 0). Age strata were <2 years and 2-16 years (1:1 ratio). 
Subsequent visits were performed at days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28 and months 3 and 6. Liver biopsies and 
suspected rejection episodes were documented during this study period as well as CsA levels. In case 
of previous study discontinuation data of acute rejection periods were collected by follow-up forms 
scheduled to be completed at months 3 and 6. 
Treatment regimen 
Investigational drug:  
Simulect® (not registered for pediatric de novo liver transplant patients) was part of the triple-
immunosupression therapy regimen, which was investigated during the study period and was therefore 
defined as study medication. Simulect® (10 mg) was supplied as a lyophilisate in vials with ampoules 
of sterile water for injection (5 mL) and had to be given of 10 mg (body weight <35 kg) or 20 mg 
(body weight ≥35 kg) strength. The first dose had to be given on day 0 within 8 hours of reperfusion 
of the graft. The second dose had to be given on the morning of day 4. Each dose was administered by 
i.v. bolus injection. 
Immunosupressive treatment:  
Patients of both treatment groups had to be treated with Simulect® (at day 0 and day 4 as described 
above). Sandimmun®/Sandimmun® Optoral had to be started with 100 mg/m²/day i.v. (2x4h) for 7 
days and was to be continued i.v. or p.o. from day 8 onwards as per center practice (with dose 
increase by factor three in case of switch from i.v. to p.o.). During the 6 months treatment period 
Sandimmun® doses had to be adjusted according to CsA-trough levels. 
Intravenous prednisolone (loading dose: 300 mg/m2, maximum 500 mg) had to be administered 
intraoperatively only in group 1 (day 0). The first dose of steroids in group 2 (day 0) had to be 
administered within 8 hours after reperfusion of the graft. Beginning from day 1 to day 6 doses of 15 
mg/m2/day had to be given i.v. in both study groups. Then, the steroid doses (oral prednisone or its 
equivalent) were to be decreased from 10 mg/m²/day p.o. (day 7-13), to 7.5 mg/m²/day p.o. (day 
14- 30), to 4 mg/m²/day p.o. (until end of month 2), to 2.5 mg/m²/day p.o. (until end of month 3) 
and to 1 mg/m²/day p.o. (until end of month 6). If steroids were not tolerated orally beyond day 6, 
they were to be given intravenously.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
All screened patients were randomized and received study medication. In the treatment group without 
intraoperative steroids more patients dropped out because of adverse events (21.1% vs. 2.6%; cf. PTT 
7.1-2). The patient disposition is shown in Table 1. 
A total of 20 protocol violations were noted in 19 patients (24.7%), with 10 patients (13.0%) showing 
protocol violations that were considered "major" and therefore led to exclusion from the per protocol 
analysis data set (multiple specifications were possible, cf. PTT 7.2-1). 
Because the primary analysis was to be performed on the intent-to-treat population (identical to the 
safety population), the results presented in this report are based on the Safety/ITT analysis set. For 
the results found in the per-protocol analyses please refer to the respective post-text tables. 
Baseline data 
Age 
The patients' mean age was 3.4 ± 4.7 years, 58.4% belonged to the stratum younger than 2 years. A 
similar proportion of boys and girls participated in this study (48.1% vs. 51.9; cf. PTT 7.4-1.1.1.a). 
Table 2 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the study patients.

End stage disease leading to transplantation 
The most frequent end stage disease was extrahepatic biliary atresia. The proportion of this end stage 
disease was higher in the younger than in the older stratum (86.7% versus 25.0%, with an overall 
proportion of 61.0%, cf. PTT 7.4-2.3.1).

Relevant medical history/current medical conditions 
All patients (100%) had a relevant medical history or current medical condition, which was active in 
most of the patients (95%).  
Prior/Concomitant medications 
About one fifths of the patients received prior medications or non-drug therapies (with intraoperative 
steroids: 23.1%, without intraoperative steroids: 15.8%, cf. PTT 7.4-4.1.1.a). Concomitant 
medications were administered to all patients (particularly medications referring to the ATC groups 
"alimentary tract and metabolism", "anti-infectives for systemic use", "blood and blood forming 
organs", "cardiovascular system", "dermatologicals", and "nervous system"; cf. PTT 7.4-4.2.1.a). 
Cold ischemia time 
The mean cold ischemia time was 7.82 ± 3.67 hrs, with comparable values in both treatment groups 
but higher values in the stratum of older patients (<2 years: 6.91 ± 3.78 hrs vs. 2-16 years: 9.09 ± 
3.15 hrs; cf. PTT 7.4-5.2). 
Study medication and immunosuppressive treatment 
Most patients received a Simulect® dose of 10 mg, nine patients received 20 mg. Four patients 
received Simulect® only at day 0 (cf PTT 8.1.-1), two of them by mistake and two of them because of 
study discontinuation. The younger patients received lower doses of immunosuppressive treatment (cf. 
PTT 8.1-1, 8.2-1,  8.3.1).

Efficacy results 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an immunosuppressive therapy 
avoiding intraoperative steroids measured by the incidence of at least one BPAR, graft loss or death 
within the first three months post-Tx. 
The incidence of the primary composite endpoint (i.e., BPAR, graft loss, or death within 3 months after 
Tx) was higher in the group without intraoperative steroids (68.4% versus 56.4%, p=0.35, cf. PTT 
9.1-1.1, PTT 9.1.-3.1). These results were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis performed in the per-
protocol population (75.8% versus 55.9%, p=0.12; cf. PTT 9.1-1.2, PTT 9.1.-3.2). Treatment 
differences were more pronounced in the younger patients (<2 years: 62.5% vs. 42.9% and 2-16 
years: 78.6% vs. 77. 8%; cf. PTT 9.1-2.1) who showed higher incidence rates for BPAR, graft loss or 
death in both treatment groups. 
These results of the primary endpoint analysis are summarized in Table 5.

Secondary objectives 
During the whole study period, BPAR was observed in 47 patients, with a higher incidence among the 
patients without intraoperative steroids (53.8% vs. 68.4%). The median for the time to BPAR was 1.93 
months and 0.75 months (intraoperative steroids vs. without intraoperative steroids, log-rank test: 
p=0.14; cf. PTT 9.1-5.4). 
The results of the secondary parameters are summarized in Table 6.

A total of 83.1% of the patients suffered from an infection (without intraoperative steroids: 89.5% vs. 
with intraoperative steroids: 76.9%; cf. PTT 10.2-6.1). Fungal infections were present in 42.1% vs. 
41.0%, viral infections in 36.8% vs. 38.5%, and bacterial infections in 47.4% vs. 25.6% (without 
intraoperative steroids vs. with intraoperative steroids; cf. PTT 10.2-6.2). 
Safety results 
Methods and variables 
The assessment of safety was based on the frequency of treatment emergent adverse events and on 
the number of laboratory values outside the pre-determined ranges. Treatment emergent adverse 
events were coded according to MedDRA terminology and displayed in the tabulated summaries. 
Adverse events which were not treatment emergent were listed only (not described in this report). The 
safety results are presented for the ITT/safety population (N=77).

Adverse events (i.e., treatment emergent AE) 
All patients in the safety population experienced at least one (treatment emergent) adverse event (cf. 
PTT 10.1-1). 42.9% of the patients suffered from an AE with "severe" intensity (47.4% of the patients 
with intraoperative steroids vs. 38.5% of the patients without intraoperative steroids; cf. PTT 10.1-3). 
Approx. half of the patients experienced AEs suspected to be study drug related (48.7% vs. 47.4%; 
most frequently infections and infestations; cf. PTT 10.1-4). 
All AEs with an incidence of ≥10% at primary SOC level are summarized in text Table 7. 
Deaths and other serious adverse events 
A summary of deaths, other serious adverse events (SAEs) or other significant AEs is provided in PTT

10.2-1 and Table 8. 
In the treatment group without intraoperative steroids more patients experienced a serious (non-fatal) 
AE (60.5% vs. 46.2%), prematurely discontinued the study (15.8% vs. 2.6%), or had an adjustment 
or temporary interruption of the study medication due to a non-serious AE (13.2% vs. 2.6%, cf. PTT 
10.2-1). Regarding the stratum of younger patients a high incidence of serious AE was observed in the 
treatment group without intraoperative steroids (70.8% vs. 52.4%; cf. PTT 10.2-1.b). 
One 14-year old boy (without intraoperative steroids) died because of uncontrolled 
bleeding/haemorrhage 27 days after transplantation. The investigator did not suspect a causal 
relationship to the study medication (10.2-2). 
Laboratory values 
Laboratory values changed during the study course similarly in both treatment groups (see section 
10.3 of post-text tables). 
Pharmacology: 
The incidence of BPAR, graft loss or death was presented by categories of C-0h and C-2h and AUC 0- 
6h. Here, the first measured CsA levels of each patient were used to dichotomize the treatment groups

by median split (within treatment groups, because of the intraoperative steroid administration in one 
group). As an exception no age stratification was provided for this analysis. 
The influence of C-0h, C-2h and AUC0-6h on the primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated by a logistic 
regression modeling "incidence on BPAR, graft loss or death" as dependent variable and "C-0h", "C- 
2h" or "AUC0-6h" as independent variables. 
No influence of C-0h, C-2h, or AUC 0-6h was found (p=0.88, p=0.68, and p=0.14; cf. PTT 9.1-6.7). 
2.3.3.  MAH’s Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study was terminated after the randomization of 77 patients (planned=80 patients). 59.7% of the 
patients completed the study. For the per-protocol analysis which was performed as sensitivity 
analysis, N=58 patients were available. The primary analysis was based on the intent-to-treat 
population which comprised N=77 patients and was identical to the safety population. 
The patients' mean age was 3.4 ± 4.7 years, 58.4% belonged to the stratum <2 years. The incidence 
of the composite primary endpoint (BPAR, graft loss, or death within 3 months post Tx) was 
descriptively higher in the group which avoided intraoperative steroids (68.4% versus 56.4%) and 
resulted in a p-value of p=0.35 (Fisher’s exact test). These results were confirmed by the sensitivity 
analysis evaluating the per-protocol population (75.8% versus 55.9%, p=0.12). In the stratum of 
patients younger than 2 years more events of the primary endpoint occurred in the treatment group 
avoiding intraoperative steroids (62.5% vs. 42.9) while patients aged 2-16 years showed similar rates 
in both treatment groups (78.6% vs. 77.8%; patients without intraoperative steroids vs. patients with 
intraoperative steroids), but the incidence rates were higher than for the younger patients. 
The incidence of infections was descriptively higher in the group avoiding intraoperative steroids 
(89.5% versus 76.9%). In the age stratum 2-16 years a similar rate of infections was observed in both 
treatment groups (72.2% vs. 78.6%, with intraoperative steroids mentioned first). In the stratum < 2 
years more infections were observed for the treatment group avoiding steroids (81.0% vs. 95.8%, 
with intraoperative steroids mentioned first) and the incidence rates were higher than for the older 
patients. 
A serious adverse event occurred more often in patients treated without intraoperative steroids (60.5% 
vs. 46.2%). In the age stratum 2-16 years SAE incidences were similar in both treatment groups 
(42.9% vs. 38.9%, without intraoperative steroids mentioned first). The younger stratum showed 
higher SAE incidences in the treatment group avoiding steroids (70.8% vs. 52.4%; without 
intraoperative steroids mentioned first) and the incidences rates were higher than for the older 
patients. 
Neither CsA morning trough level (C-0h) nor the level taken 2 hours after morning dose (C-2h) nor the 
AUC 0-6h showed an influence on the primary efficacy variable BPAR, graft loss or death within the 
first 3 months post Tx. 
Thus, the investigated study regime – avoiding intraoperative steroids in a post-transplant triple-
immunosuppressive therapy consisting of Simulect®, Sandimmun®/Sandimmun® Optoral and 
steroids in pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients – lead to a descriptively increased rate of biopsy 
proven acute rejection episodes, graft loss or death within the first 3 months post transplantation. This

disadvantage was caused by the stratum of patients younger than 2 years while patients aged 2-16 
years showed similar incidence rates in both treatment groups. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted data from pediatric patients included in Study CCHI621ADE04, a multicenter, 
open-label, randomized, two arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of a therapy avoiding 
intraoperative steroids in combination with Simulect®, Sandimmun®/ Sandimmun® Optoral and 
steroids in pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients  (SINTRA). 
The study population of pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients evaluated in this study is different 
to the population of de novo renal transplant recipients Simulect has been approved for. 
Data interpretation is limited based on the relatively low number of patients, especially in the group of 
patients aged 2-16 years. However, study results indicate that the avoidance of intraoperative steroids 
is associated with an increase in infections, biopsy proven acute rejection episodes, graft loss or death 
within the first 3 months post transplantation in patients <2 years of age. 
Benefit-risk-assessment 
Based on the data submitted, the benefit/risk profile of Simulect in paediatric subjects in the approved 
indication (prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal transplantation in adult and 
paediatric patients (1-17 years), to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and 
corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in patients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or 
in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive regimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, 
corticosteroids and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) remains unchanged. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

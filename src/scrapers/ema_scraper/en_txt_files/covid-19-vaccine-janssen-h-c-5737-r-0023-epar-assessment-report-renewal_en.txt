1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 11 March 2021, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (also referred to as Ad26.COV2.S). This implied that, pursuant to Article 
14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the 
marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as 
listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of 
the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH Janssen-Cilag International N.V., submitted to the Agency on 
10 September 2021 an application for renewal of the conditional MA for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. 
The expiry date of the MA is 11 March 2022. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 25 February 2021 to 31 July 2021.

Since the granting of the conditional MA, the MAH has submitted the following SOBs: 
Quality-related SOBs 
  SOB related to the AS: In order to confirm the consistency of the active substance 
manufacturing process, the applicant should provide additional validation and 
comparability data. 
A SOB related to the active substance was added following Variation IB/11 to upgrade the AS facility at 
Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands). Please refer to Table 2 for a detailed overview of the quality 
SOBs. Interim reports related to this SOB have been submitted and evaluated, the final report has 
been submitted and the assessment of type II/37 is ongoing. 
It should be noted that the same SOB may apply to future variations to implement additional 
manufacturing sites, this overarching SOB (applicable to various manufacturing sites) cannot be 
considered closed for the time being and should therefore remain in the Annex II.

At time of approval of the conditional marketing authorisation in March 2021, the following quality-
related specific obligation was included in Annex II.  
  SOB related to the FP: In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product 
manufacturing process, the applicant should provide additional validation and 
comparability data. 
At the time of approval of the conditional marketing authorisation in March 2021, this SOB only 
referred to the Catalent Bloomington, Indiana (USA) Finished Product manufacturing site. In the 
meantime, the MAH has provided the remaining validation and comparability data for the Catalent 
Bloomington, Indiana (USA) site as requested in this SOB. The data have been assessed and were 
found acceptable. Accordingly, the specific obligation related to the Catalent Bloomington Indiana 
(USA) site can be considered as fulfilled. 
However, this SOB was afterwards also applied to several variations which have been submitted post-
approval of the conditional MA to implement additional FP manufacturing sites in the conditional MA: 
Aspen (South-Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), Merck Sharp & Dohme West 
Point (USA) and Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France), These FP manufacturing sites were also 
conditionally approved via variation procedures with the specific obligation to provide additional 
validation and comparability data.  
For the Aspen (South Africa) site, the remaining validation and comparability data have also been 
provided. The data have been assessed and were found acceptable. Accordingly, the specific obligation 
related to the Aspen site (South Africa) can also be considered as fulfilled. 
For the IDT Biologika (Germany) site, the remaining validation and comparability data have also been 
provided. The data have been assessed and were found acceptable. Accordingly, the specific obligation 
related to the IDT Biologika (Germany) site can also be considered as fulfilled. 
For the other FP manufacturing sites (Catalent Anagni Italy, Merck Sharp & Dohme West Point USA and 
Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile France), the assessment of the data as requested by the SOB related to 
the FP is still ongoing or the submission of the data is pending in accordance with the agreed timelines. 
For some of these sites, interim reports have been provided with partial and/or preliminary data which 
were all found acceptable thus far. Please refer to Table 2 for a full overview of the quality SOBs. 
All interim reports and final reports related to as and FP SOBs for the various manufacturing sites have 
been submitted before the specific due date for each data package (as approved in the conditional MA 
and the respective Variation reports). 
Taken together, whereas these SOBs relates to different FP and AS manufacturing sites which were 
either proposed in the original conditional MA or post-approval of the conditional MA via variation 
procedures, all data submitted thus far as part of these SOBs (“In order to confirm the consistency of 
the finished product manufacturing process, the applicant should provide additional validation and 
comparability data”) were found acceptable and confirm that the manufacturing process yields product 
of adequate and consistent quality that complies with its specifications, confirming/indicating the 
validates status of the process. For the Catalent Bloomington, Indiana (USA) site, the Aspen (South 
Africa) and the IDT Biologika (Germany) sites, this SOB can be considered as fulfilled. For the other 
sites, assessment is still ongoing or pending the submission of the interim report and final reports in 
line with the agreed due dates. 
It should be noted that these SOBs may be applied to future variations as well (for additional FP and 
AS manufacturing sites). 
As such, since assessment of FP and AS SOBs is still ongoing for several manufacturing sites and since

double-blind phase) on COV3001 will 
not be available for submission in the 
renewal. Given that a submission of 
data on COV3001 is expected in 
Q42021, as agreed during the meeting 
held on 17 June, the annual renewal 
will therefore focus on information 
related to accrual, conduct of the study 
and MAH conclusion on feasibility of 
concluding study on time only. 
Final CSR (including long-term follow-
up) is on track for submission by 31 
December 2023. The CSR for the final 
analysis of the double-blind phase is 
planned in the last quarter of 2021. 
2.1.  Outstanding Specific Obligations – status report for period covered 
SOB (quality-related) 
In order to confirm the consistency of the active substance manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
A SOB related to the active substance was added following Variation IB/11 to upgrade the AS facility at 
Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands). Please refer to Table 2 for a detailed overview of the quality 
SOBs. Interim reports related to this SOB have been submitted and evaluated, the final report has 
been submitted and the assessment of type II/37 is ongoing. 
It should be noted that the same SOB may apply to future variations to implement additional 
manufacturing sites, this overarching SOB (applicable to various manufacturing sites) cannot be 
considered closed for the time being and should therefore remain in the Annex II. 
In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
A SOB initially related to the Catalent Bloomington (US) site in the conditional MA. For this site, the 
requirements as stated in the SOB have been fulfilled. However, the same SOB has afterwards also 
been applied to other manufacturing sites implemented post-approval of the conditional MA via 
Variation procedures. Since assessment of SOB is still ongoing for several manufacturing sites and

since this SOB may also be applied to future variations to implement additional manufacturing sites, 
this overarching SOB (applicable to various manufacturing sites) cannot be considered closed for the 
time being. 
In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the applicant should 
provide additional validation and comparability data. 
The Rapporteur is of the opinion that Specific Obligation SOB has been fulfilled, i.e. for the Catalent 
Bloomington (USA) site, Aspen (South Africa) and the IDT Biologika site (Germany).  
However, the same SOB also applies to several other manufacturing sites which were implemented 
post-approval of the conditional MA via Variations. Since assessment of SOB is still ongoing for several 
manufacturing sites and since this SOB may also be applied to future variations to implement 
additional manufacturing sites, this overarching SOB (applicable to various manufacturing sites) cannot 
be considered closed for the time being and should therefore remain in the Annex II. 
SOB (clinical-related) 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 Vaccine, the MAH 
should submit the final Clinical Study Report for the randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind study VAC31518COV3001. 
The CSR for the final analysis of the double-blind phase of the pivotal Phase 3 COV3001 study is not 
yet available. Given that a date for submission of data for the final analysis of the double-blind phase 
of COV3001 is expected in the fourth quarter of 2021 (Q4 2021), it was agreed with EMA in a meeting 
held on 17 June 2021 that the annual renewal would focus on information related to accrual, conduct 
of the study and a conclusion provided by the MAH with respect to the feasibility of concluding the 
study on time. This information is described below. 
As of the cut-off date for the final analysis of the double-blind phase (09 July 2021), 49,497 
participants have been screened, of whom 43,788 were randomized to receive the study vaccine in a 
1:1 ratio (Ad26.COV2.S [5×1010 vp]/placebo). As of the 09 July cut-off, 95.5% of participants were 
ongoing and 4.5% discontinued prematurely. 
As of protocol Amendment 3, study participants who became eligible to receive an authorized/licensed 
COVID-19 vaccine during the course of the study could request to be unblinded for this purpose. As of 
protocol Amendment 4, after Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) in the United States (US) and 
conditional MA in the EU, unblinding of all participants was initiated and participants in the placebo 
group were offered a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S. Unblinded participants, whether in the vaccine or 
control group, were encouraged to continue to be followed in this study. A total of 13,703 participants 
from the placebo group have been vaccinated in the open-label phase (crossover). 
The final analysis of the double-blind phase of COV3001 is ongoing. The CSR for the final analysis of 
the double-blind phase will be available in the fourth quarter of 2021. The specific obligation for 
COV3001 linked to the conditional MA is as follows: "In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 Vaccine, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report for the 
randomised, placebo-controlled observer-blind study VAC31518COV3001," and needs to be fulfilled by 
31 December 2023. Based on the current status of COV3001, the MAH confirms the date of 31 
December 2023 for completion of this specific obligation is feasible. 
In conclusion, the Clinical SOB has not been fulfilled during this annual renewal. The MAH plans to 
complete this SOB by December 2023.

2.2.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
In relation to the quality related SOBs, new data regarding FP and AS SOBs has emerged during the 
period covered by this annual renewal. The new data emerged are compliant in terms of adherence to 
deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data submitted. The Specific Obligation related 
to the FP has been fulfilled for the Catalent Bloomington (USA), Aspen (South Africa) and the IDT 
Biologika (Germany) sites. However, the same SOB also applies to several other manufacturing sites 
which were implemented post-approval of the conditional MA via variations. Since the assessment of 
FP and AS related SOBs is still ongoing for several manufacturing sites and since these SOBs may also 
be applied to future variations to implement additional manufacturing sites, these overarching SOBs 
(applicable to various manufacturing sites) cannot be considered closed for the time being and should 
therefore remain in the Annex II. 
In relation to the clinical SOB, no new data has emerged during the period covered by this annual 
renewal. Based on the current status of COV3001, the MAH confirms the date of 31 December 2023 for 
completion of this specific obligation is feasible ("In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 Vaccine, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report for the 
randomised, placebo-controlled observer-blind study VAC31518COV3001.").  The SOB is still not 
fulfilled, the final clinical study report is due on 31 December 2023.  
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Quality 
Apart from the SOBs, the applicant has also provided additional quality data related to the 
recommendations. 
At time of approval of the conditional MA, a list of 14 recommendations (REC)/ post-authorisation 
measures, (PAM) was included. 
PAMs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 have been fulfilled. 
REC 1: The applicant has provided the validation data of the third process validation inoculum batch. 
REC 2: The MAH has provided the results of the tier 2 comparability testing for the DS lots 
manufactured by the 900L scale process at Janssen Biologics Leiden. All results were comparable with 
those of DS lots/intermediates from the other registered sites and/or process scales for all parameters. 
These data confirm that DS lots manufactured at Janssen Biologics Leiden using the large scale 900L 
process are comparable with DS material form the registered sites and/or process scales. 
REC 3: The MAH has provided the results of the tier 2 comparability testing for the DS lots 
manufactured by the 900L scale process at Emergent (US). All results were comparable with those of 
DS lots/intermediates from the other registered sites and/or process scales for all parameters. These 
data confirm that DS lots manufactured at Emergent (US) using the large scale 900L process are 
comparable with DS material form the registered sites and/or process scales. 
REC 5: The MAH has provided CTD sections describing the vial depyrogenation and the 
decontamination of the filling line at the Catalent Indiana site. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 10/43 
 
 
 
REC 6: The MAH has provided the tier 2 comparability data for the GRAM (US) site. All results were 
comparable with those of the phase 3 clinical DP lots. These data confirm that DP manufactured at the 
GRAM site (US) is comparable to the phase 3 clinical DP lots. 
REC 7: The MAH has provided validation data for the GRAM DP manufacturing site confirming 
homogeneity of the final bulk after mixing and of the final vaccine after filling. The results show that 
the DP process ensures homogeneity of the final bulk and the filled vaccines. Also hold times were 
confirmed.  
REC 8: To evaluate the sensitivity of Ad26.COV2.S FP when exposed to light stress, a study based on 
the ICH Q1B requirement should be performed. The samples should be tested for potency by QPA, 
turbidity by A350, radius by DLS and aggregation by AF4-MALS by 30 September 2021. 
REC 9: The MAH has provided the results from the forced degradation studies using thermal stress 
conditions at 37ºC for up to 28 days, which were part of the comparability analysis between clinical 
Phase 1/2 lots and phase 3 lots. The data confirm the comparability. 
REC 10: A final conclusion has been provided on the criticality of the potentially critical process 
parameters. 
REC 13: The MAH as performed an elemental impurity risk assessment in accordance with ICH Q3D. 
The assessment showed that the risk for elemental impurities in Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen drug 
product is negligible. 
Five PAMs (recommendations 4, 11, 12 and 14) are still open and are detailed below. The data should 
be provided as soon as possible when available. 
• 
• 
The applicant is requested to initiate stability studies (including at least 3 representative lots) 
for the 900L scale AS process at Janssen Biologics (Leiden, NL). The applicant is requested to 
provide the AS stability data for 3 representative AS batches for each manufacturing scale (50L 
and 900L) when the respective studies have been finalised and the results are available. 
The applicant is requested to provide the results of the 6-month time point of the FP container 
leachables study. 
•  Regarding the FP specification for polydispersity, the applicant is requested to establish and 
justify acceptance criteria once sufficient experience and data for this parameter are available. 
• 
The applicant is requested to provide the FP stability data for the 3 FP PPQ batches from the 
GRAM site when the stability studies have been finalised and the results are available.  
3.2.  Non-clinical 
No non-clinical studies initiated or completed during the reporting period were submitted, nor any 
other new additional nonclinical information to report. 
3.3.  Clinical efficacy and immunogenicity 
No new efficacy or immunogenicity data have been submitted since the initial MAA.

3.4.  Clinical safety 
The initial safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S was established based on the COV3001 data available at the 
time of the conditional MA. Since then, Ad26.COV2.S was administered in further clinical trials and 
more than 25 million doses of Ad26.COV2.S have been administered worldwide. The safety profile of 
the Ad26.COV2.S is monitored through routine safety pharmacovigilance activities (such as signal 
detection, Monthly Summary Safety Reports (MSSRs)) for which the results were reflected in the EU-
RMP updates and updates to the SmPC during the reporting period.

Exposure Study COV3012  
The non-Company-sponsored COV3012 (Sisonke) study, hereby referred to as COV3012, is an open-
label, single-arm, Phase 3b implementation study to monitor the safety of the single-dose 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (5x1010 vp) among health care workers in South Africa. As it is a single-arm 
study, no effectiveness objectives have been prespecified in the Sisonke study. No electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) are available for this trial. However, serious adverse events (SAEs) are captured 
and reported in the Global Medical Safety (GMS) database. As of 31 July 2021, a total of 490,863 
participants in the Sisonke study received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

Overview of signals 
Data related to the below signals were carefully reviewed through MSSRs or relevant signal procedures 
leading to several requests to update the product information and EU-RMP.  
Signals Confirmed as Important Identified Risks 
Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) 
A signal evaluation (EPITT number: 19689) was performed investigating TTS in relation to the 
compound. As a result, the RMP and SmPC section 4.8 was updated to include TTS as identified risk in 
the RMP and as adverse drug reaction (ADR) in the SmPC section 4.8 (EMEA/H/C/005737/IA/0004, 
EMEA/H/C/005737/IA/0003 and EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0006/G). 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) 
Based on the observation of a disproportionality of spontaneous/solicited post-marketing reports of 
cases of GBS in the MSSR and an assessment of possible causality with the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen, 
the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 were updated with GBS in the frame of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0012. Additionally, the RMP was updated to include GBS as an Important 
Identified Risk in the list of safety concerns. 
Signals Confirmed as Important Potential Risks 
Thromboembolic events are currently being assessed by the MAH in the MSSR, and additional safety 
data will be submitted in line with the PRAC request of the PRAC Assessment Report for the 5th 
pandemic safety update MEA 014.4 dated September 2, 2021. 
Thrombocytopenia 
In line with recommendations from EMA PRAC received on 05 August 2021 in response to the MSSR 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/MEA/014.3), the MAH has submitted a Type II variation on August 25, 2021 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0020) to update the SmPC, to include immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as an 
ADR with a frequency "not known" (Section 4.8 of the SmPC). A warning and precaution statement 
relating to observation of very low platelet levels following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S will be 
included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. ITP was furthermore included as important identified risk in the 
RMP.  
Initially, the MAH proposed to update the RMP version 2.2 to include `thrombocytopenia´ as an 
important potential risk. However, due to additional information regarding ITP that led to the inclusion 
of this event in section 4.8 of the SmPC of the product information (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/020), the 
MAH proposed to add ‘Immune Thrombocytopenia’ instead of ‘Thrombocytopenia’ and re-classify the 
safety concern to important identified risk.  The addition of ITP as an important identified risk was 
endorsed. It was nevertheless not agreed to narrow the term ‘thrombocytopenia’ to ITP since 
‘thrombocytopenia’ remains an important safety concern which has not been sufficiently characterized 
at this stage to allow a narrowing of the definition 
Furthermore, the case definition of ITP proposed by the MAH (2018 ITP definition by the American 
Society of Hematology (Kelton 2018) has been questioned in another procedure 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 17/43 
 
 
 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/II/018) that was finalized after the cut-off for this renewal procedure. The RMP 
was to be updated with the definition of ITP in line with the outcome of EMEA/H/C/005737/II/018. 
Signals Confirmed as Identified Risks Not Categorized as Important (New 
Adverse Drug Reactions) 
Late Breaking information on additional ADRs that were identified by the MAH for inclusion in the SmPC 
is provided below.  
As part of the regular safety monitoring activities, the following events were identified as validated 
post-marketing safety signals: lymphadenopathy, paraesthesia, hypoesthesia, diarrhoea, vomiting, and 
tinnitus. These events were mostly reported as nonserious. 
Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) 
The SmPC section 4.3 has been updated to include a contraindication for individuals who have 
previously experienced episodes of CLS (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0010). The MAH should continue to 
monitor CLS and present results in upcoming MSSRs and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). 
Lymphadenopathy 
Based on cumulative review of post-marketing data, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to 
include lymphadenopathy with a frequency rate of “rare” (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014). 
Tinnitus 
The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated to include tinnitus with a frequency rate of “rare” based on 
imbalance in clinical study results and post-marketing data (EMEA/H/C/005737/II0014). 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea has been included in the list of ADR at the frequency rate “uncommon” in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC, this was based on biological plausibility and an observed disproportionality in post-marketing 
data (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014). 
Vomiting 
Based on reported disproportionality in post-marketing data, a causality between Janssen Covid-19 
vaccine and vomiting was established. The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated to include vomiting as 
an ADR with the frequency “rare” (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014). 
Hypoesthesia and Paraesthesia 
Based on cumulative review of both clinical data and post-marketing data where a disproportionality of 
paraesthesia and hypoesthesia was observed, the SmPC section 4.8 has been updated to include 
paraesthesia as an ADR with the frequency rate of "uncommon" and hypoesthesia as an ADR with the 
frequency rate "rare" (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014).

Dizziness 
Based on post-marketing data, the SmPC has been updated to include dizziness as an ADR frequency 
“uncommon” (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0020). 
Adverse Reactions 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) listed in the SmPC, approved 03 August 2021, are provided below. 
This table includes all updates that have been done from the time of the conditional MA in the EU on 
11th of March 2021 up to DLP for this application. 
 Frequencies were originally calculated based on the Safety Subset of study COV3001. The most 
common local adverse reaction reported was injection site pain (48.6%). The most common systemic 
adverse reactions were headache (38.9%), fatigue (38.2%), myalgia (33.2%), and nausea (14.2%). 
Pyrexia (defined as body temperature ≥38°C) was observed in 9% of participants. Most adverse 
reactions occurred within 1 to 2 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity and 
of short duration (1 to 2 days). Adverse drug reactions based on the latest updates to the SmPC 
[EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014, submitted on 23 July 2021, approved on 03 September 2021 and 
including Late Breaking Information from EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0020, submitted 25 August 2021, 
procedure ongoing] observed during study CV3001 or from post marketing sources are organized by 
MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Frequency categories are shown in Table 5, with ADRs at the time 
of the initial submission in grey font, and ADRs to be included pending approval in italics.  
Of note, following the DLP of this renewal, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has also been added as an 
ADR in the table with the rare frequency (although not shown in the Table 5).

Table 5 Adverse reactions reported following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S- Changes since the initial 
application 
Signals Not Confirmed by the MAH During the Reporting Period 
o  Review of Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
In the last MSSR it was concluded that there is currently insufficient data to support for a causal 
relationship with the Ad26.COV2.S and myocarditis or pericarditis, however, the MAH will continue 
to monitor this topic closely.  
o  Review of Blindness  
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 20/43 
 
 
 
 
 
Blindness/visual impairment has been further evaluated in the last two MSSRs and the MAH has 
presented a cumulative review, based on that information a causal relationship could not be 
established. The MAH will continue to monitor this topic closely. 
o  Flare of autoimmune disorders 
o  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome: evaluation currently ongoing 
Flare of Autoimmune Disorders and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) are currently under 
evaluation. 
Significant Changes Made to The Reference Information  
The Reference Information (RI) for Ad26.COV2.S, per the initial conditional MA application, is the 
SmPC.  
The SmPC in effect at the start of the period (i.e., at the time of the initial conditional MA) was dated 
11 March 2021 and the SmPC in effect at the end of the renewal reporting interval was submitted on 
23 July 2021 and approved on 03 September 2021. The SmPC for Ad26.COV2.S was updated 
numerous times during this reporting period, through to the data lock point (DLP) of this renewal 
reporting interval (31 July 2021). Table 6 below provides a listing of significant changes to the SmPC 
during the reporting interval.

The following changes to the product information were recommended after the DLP of this renewal:  
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) has been kept under close monitoring by PRAC due to a higher 
proportion of cases of VTE observed in the vaccinated group compared with the placebo group in the 
large clinical trial used to authorise COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. When taking all evidence into account, 
PRAC concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that VTE is linked to vaccination with 
Ad26.COV2.S. PRAC therefore recommended adding VTE to the product information of Ad26.COV2.S as 
a rare side effect (i.e. occurring in less than 1 in 1,000 individuals), together with warnings for 
healthcare professionals and people taking the vaccine, especially those who may have an increased 
risk of VTE. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 23/43 
 
 
 
 
 
PRAC recommended that transverse myelitis (inflammation in parts of the spinal cord) should be added 
to the product information as a side effect of Ad26.COV2.S (ongoing procedure). This conclusion is 
based on worldwide transverse myelitis cases spontaneously reported by 31 August 2021, of which 10 
have been assessed to have at least a possible causal relationship with the vaccine, and 1 a probable 
causal relationship (more than 33 million doses of Ad26.COV2.S were estimated to have been 
administered worldwide by 31 August 2021). Spontaneously reported cases concern suspected side 
effects, i.e. medical events that have been observed after vaccination, but which are not necessarily 
related to or caused by the vaccine. The frequency category is proposed to be ‘unknown’ because it is 
generally difficult to robustly estimate side effect frequencies from cases of suspected side effects that 
have been reported spontaneously by healthcare professionals or patients. 
Ad26 platform data 
Updated reports presenting the cumulative review of SAEs, pregnancy data, and neuroinflammatory 
adverse events with the Ad26 platform data were submitted and have/will be evaluated in: 
- 
Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/REC/19 (cut-off date is 31 Dec 2020 for the AdVac V6.0 
database and 21 Dec 2020 for the additional studies in the Janssen Global Safety Database) 
(closed) 
- 
 Procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/REC/34 (cut-off date is 31 July 2021 for the AdVac V7.0 
database) (currently assessed). 
Current remaining recommendations: 
The applicant is recommended to submit, to support the development of future Ad26 vaccines, an 
updated Advac report integrating the data from the COVID-19 vaccine. Several points to consider in 
this future report are raised below.

3.5.  Pharmacovigilance inspections 
Pharmacovigilance (PV) system inspections conducted during the reporting period as part of the  
ongoing EMA Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) evaluation of the Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccine are listed below: 
During the reporting period for this renewal, 1 sponsor inspection by the Dutch Health and Youth Care 
Inspectorate took place for the COV3001 clinical trial. None of the findings have a direct impact on the 
benefit/risk balance for Ad26.COV2.S. 
4.  Risk management plan 
No updated version of the RMP was submitted within this renewal procedure. The MAH has confirmed 
that the current approved RMP (Version 1.4) which was approved at the time of the initial conditional 
MA, remains unchanged and applicable at the time of the DLP. 
After the DLP of this procedure (31 July 2021), an updated RMP (version 2.2) was submitted to EMA 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0018) on 3 August 2021. to include the following: 
• 
Thrombocytopenia as an Important Potential Risk following the outcome of the signal of 
Embolic and thrombotic events (SDA 018.1, EPITT number 19689 procedure No. SDA 018.1) 
and the opinion of procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0006/G. Following receipt of the PRAC 
outcome dated 05 August 2021 related to the MSSR covering June 2021 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/MEA/014.3), in which the PRAC made the request to update 
thrombocytopenia to an Important Identified Risk, the MAH response to this request was 
submitted as a supplementary sequence to ongoing procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0018. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 25/43 
 
 
 
 
• 
To propose studies aimed at further characterization of TTS and thrombocytopenia, following 
the outcome of the signal of Embolic and thrombotic events (SDA 018.1, EPITT number 19689 
procedure No. SDA 018.1) 
•  GBS as Important Identified Risk and update all relevant sections of the RMP accordingly 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0012) 
Initially, the MAH proposed to update the RMP to include thrombocytopenia as an important potential 
risk. However, after the cut-off date of this renewal the MAH has proposed to re-classify the safety 
concern of thrombocytopenia (including immune thrombocytopenia) to important identified risk due to 
additional information regarding ITP (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/018). 
A summary of the safety concerns at the start and end of the reporting period is shown in the table 
below.  
Table 7  Summary of safety concerns at the start and end of the reporting period  
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
No changes to the Product Information (PI) are introduced with this renewal procedure. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 26/43 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (adenovirus type 
26 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein) is included in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation; 
It has SOBs which have not still been fulfilled. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
6.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
6.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
Quality-related SOBs 
During the period covered by this annual renewal data on the SOBs have been submitted that overall 
are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and are compliant in terms of acceptability of data 
submitted. 
At time of approval of the conditional marketing authorisation in March 2021, the following quality-
related specific obligation was included in Annex II.  
  SOB: In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the 
applicant should provide additional validation and comparability data. 
At the time of approval of the conditional marketing authorisation in March 2021, this SOB only 
referred to the Catalent Bloomington (USA) Finished Product manufacturing site. In the meantime, the 
MAH has provided the remaining validation and comparability data for the Catalent Bloomington site as 
requested in this SOB. The data have been assessed and were found acceptable. Accordingly, the 
specific obligation related to the Catalent Bloomington site can be considered as fulfilled. 
However, this SOB was afterwards also applied to several variations which have been submitted post-
approval of the conditional MA to implement additional manufacturing sites in the conditional MA: 
Aspen (South-Africa), IDT Biologika (Germany), Catalent Anagni (Italy), Merck Sharp & Dohme West 
Point (USA) and Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile (France). These manufacturing sites were also 
conditionally approved via variation procedures with the specific obligation to provide additional 
validation and comparability data. 
For the IDT Biologika (Germany) and Aspen (South-Africa) sites, the remaining validation and 
comparability data have also been provided. The data have been assessed and were found acceptable. 
Accordingly, the specific obligation related to the IDT Biologika (Germany) and Aspen (South-Africa) 
sites can also be considered as fulfilled. 
For the other manufacturing sites (Catalent Anagni Italy, Sanofi Pasteur Marcy l’Etoile France and 
Merck Sharp & Dohme West Point USA), the assessment of the data as requested by SOB is still 
ongoing. For some of these sites, interim reports have been provided with partial and/or preliminary 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation

data which were all found acceptable thus far. 
All interim reports and final reports related to the FP SOB for the various manufacturing sites have 
been submitted before the specific due date for each data package (as approved in the conditional MA 
and the respective variation reports). 
In addition, a SOB related to the active substance was added following Variation IB/11 to upgraded the 
AS facility at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands). Please refer to Table 2 for a detailed overview of 
the quality SOBs. Interim reports related to this SOB have been submitted and evaluated, the final 
report has been submitted and the assessment of type II/37 is ongoing. 
An overview of the conditions and specific obligations submitted since the granting of marketing 
authorisation and prior to 1st September 2021 is presented below.

of adequate and consistent quality that complies with its specifications, confirming/indicating the 
validates status of the process. For the Catalent Bloomington (USA) site, the Aspen south Africa site 
and the IDT Biologika (Germany) site, this SOB can be considered as fulfilled. For the other site, 
assessment is still ongoing. 
In addition, a Specific Obligation related to the active substance was added following Variation IB/11 to 
upgrade the AS facility at Janssen Biologics Leiden (Netherlands). Please refer to Table 2 for a detailed 
overview of the quality SOBs. Interim reports related to this SOB have been submitted and evaluated, 
the final report has been submitted and the assessment of type II/37 is ongoing. 
It should be noted that these SOBs may be applied to future variations as well (for additional 
manufacturing sites). 
As such, since the assessment of AS and FP related SOBs is still ongoing for several manufacturing 
sites and since these SOBs may also be applied to future variations to implement additional 
manufacturing sites, these overarching SOBs (applicable to various manufacturing sites) cannot be 
considered closed for the time being.

6.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the benefit-risk of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in the approved indication. 
Furthermore, the data collected as part of the specific obligation(s) for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen 
during the period covered by this annual renewal continue to support its positive benefit-risk balance in 
the approved indication. 
Favourable effects 
As stated in the EPAR of the conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, 
the cMA was granted based on data of the pivotal Phase 3 trial COV3001 and supporting studies. No 
new efficacy or immunogenicity data are submitted in the renewal application. 
Efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S for the co-primary endpoint ‘moderate to severe/critical COVID-19’ with an 
onset from Day 14 after vaccination was 66.9% (adjusted 95% CI: 59.03; 73.40) over a median follow 
up time of 58.0 days, in seronegative individuals. For the co-primary endpoint ‘moderate to 
severe/critical COVID-19’ with an onset from Day 28 after vaccination, efficacy was 66.1% (adjusted 
95% CI: 55.01; 74.80) over the same period, in seronegative individuals. The primary objective was 
met for both co-primary endpoints since the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI of vaccine efficacy were 
above the pre-specified limit of 30%.  
Efficacy against severe disease was demonstrated. Of the 116 vs. 348 primary endpoint cases with an 
onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 14 (12%) vs. 60 
(17%) were classified as severe/critical (further referred to as severe, also in the SmPC). The point 
estimate of VE against severe disease was 76.7% (adjusted 95% CI: 54.56; 89.09) over a median 
follow up of 58 days, in SARS-COV-2 seronegative subjects. Of the 66 vs. 193 primary endpoint cases 
with an onset at least 28 days after vaccination in the vaccine vs. placebo group respectively, 5 (8%) 
vs. 34 (18%) were classified as severe. VE against severe disease was estimated at 85.4% (adjusted 
95% CI: 54.15; 96.90) over the same follow-up period in seronegative subjects. Of the 14 vs. 60 
severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the Ad26.COV2.S group vs. placebo 
group, 2 vs. 6 were hospitalised. Three died (all in the placebo group). Most of the remaining cases 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 36/43 
 
 
 
 
only fulfilled the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (SpO2<93%). For many cases 
this was based on self-measured abnormal oxygen saturation episodes (at home). All cases were 
adjudicated by an independent committee of clinical experts. 
There were 2 vs. 8 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation at least 14 days 
after vaccination in the active vs. placebo group, respectively. The finding was supported by post-hoc 
analyses which identified 2 vs. 29 cases of all COVID-19 related hospitalisations by implementing a 
broader search based on all available information (including SAE forms) in the extended data set, i.e. 
all COVID-19 cases with a positive PCR result, including all cases from a local laboratory result not yet 
confirmed by the central laboratory at the time of the analysis. 
In participants ≥65 years, based on the primary endpoint, efficacy was 82.4% (95% CI: 63.90; 92.38) 
after 14 days post-vaccination and 74.0% (95% CI: 34.40; 91.35) after 28 days post-vaccination. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No new uncertainties and limitations have emerged since no new efficacy or immunogenicity data have 
been submitted since the cMA.  As described in the EPAR, the main uncertainties remain the unknown 
duration of protection and efficacy in risk groups, e.g. immunocompromised persons due to condition 
or immunosuppressive therapies, frail individuals, individuals with uncontrolled underlying disease or 
with several underlying diseases. Whether efficacy is higher against severe cases compared to all 
symptomatic cases is not confirmed yet, but there is a trend in that direction. Another uncertainty is 
vaccine efficacy against variants of concern. Efficacy was demonstrated in South Africa where the 
South African variant 20H/501Y.V2 was predominant. Efficacy was demonstrated in Brazil, but there 
was no predominant variant in Brazil. Two third of the cases may be attributable to the P.2 lineage. 
Spike sequence data were available for only 70% of the cases and a higher proportion of samples were 
sequenced in the placebo group as compared to the vaccine group, which could lead to biases. An 
analysis of vaccine efficacy per SARS-CoV-2 variant is planned upon completion of the sequencing.  
The extent and the onset of cross-protection against other relevant circulating or newly emerging 
strains of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and should be investigated post-authorisation.  
Unfavourable effects 
Data from clinical studies 
At the time of the c MA, the assessment of Ad26.COV2.S safety was based on the Phase 3 study 
COV3001 (up to the cut-off date of 22 January 2021), comprising 43,783 participants who received 
either a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5x1010 vp (21,895 adults) or placebo (21,888 adults) (FAS). 
Reactogenicity data were collected in a subset of 6,736 participants who received either vaccine (3,356 
adults) or placebo (3,380 adults) (Safety subset). Information on unsolicited AEs was collected for 28 
days after vaccination, information on AESIs and SAEs is collected for the entire study duration. At the 
time of the primary analysis, the median follow-up after vaccination was 58 days in both groups. 
Any solicited local and systemic AEs were reported more frequently in Ad26.COV2.S than in the control 
group (66% and 41.9% of evaluated participants respectively, within the first 7 days following 
injection). The most frequently reported solicited local AE after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was injection 
site pain (48.7% vs. 16.7%, respectively). The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were 
headache (39% in Ad26.COV2.S group vs. 23.8% in the placebo group), fatigue (38.3% vs. 21.6%, 
respectively), and myalgia (33.2% vs. 12.8%). Pyrexia was reported in 9.0% participants in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (vs. 0.6% of participants in the placebo group). Most solicited AEs were transient 
and self-limited. Overall, the median duration of the selected solicited AEs was similar in both groups 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 37/43 
 
 
 
(1 to 2 days after vaccination), and also the median time to onset (within 1 to 3 days after 
vaccination). Solicited adverse events were mainly grade 1 or 2. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited 
AEs was low overall, but higher in participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2.2%) compared to 
participants in the placebo group (0.7%). There was no grade 4 solicited AEs. 
In the safety subset, the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported was low and similar in both (13.1% vs. 
12%, respectively). Unsolicited AEs were largely consistent with solicited AEs observed following 
vaccination, such as headache, fatigue, myalgia, and vaccination site pain. The most frequent 
unsolicited ADRs that were not recorded as solicited AEs were chills, arthralgia, malaise, asthenia, 
muscular weakness and pain in extremity. Most reported unsolicited AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in 
severity. There was a similar frequency of participants with unsolicited AEs of at least Grade 3 in both 
groups. The frequency of unsolicited AEs that were considered related to vaccination was higher in 
participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group as compared to placebo (7.2% vs. 4.6%, respectively). 
Up to the cut-off date, in the FAS, the same frequency of subjects reported at least one treatment 
emergent AESI in both groups (0.6%). Few reported AESIs were assessed as related (0.2% vs. 0.1%, 
respectively). 
Fewer deaths were observed in the Ad26.COV.2.S group (3, none confirmed to be associated with 
COVID-19) compared to the placebo group (16, including 6 confirmed to be associated with COVID-
19). In the FAS, 0.4% subjects in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.6% subjects in the placebo group 
reported 1 or more non-fatal SAEs. However, a similar frequency of subjects reported SAEs not 
associated with COVID-19 in both groups (0.4%). Of the 227 SAEs reported, 7 SAEs (reported for 7 
participants) in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 3 SAEs (reported for 2 participants) in the placebo group 
were considered to be possibly related to the vaccination. The reported SAEs considered related by the 
investigator for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were Guillain-Barré syndrome, pericarditis, brachial 
radiculitis, post-vaccination syndrome, Type IV hypersensitivity and 2 cases of facial paralysis. 
Overall, the safety profile of the vaccine was similar independently of the subgroups. However, 
reactogenicity was milder and less frequent in older adults aged ≥65 years compared to the younger 
adults aged ≥18 to 64. Higher reactogenicity was reported in females compared to males (although 
both subgroups had a similar median age). 
In study COV3001, the most frequently reported ‘non-anaphylactic allergic reactions’ were rash (24 vs. 
16; 10 related vs. 6 related, respectively), urticaria (8 vs. 3; 3 related vs. none, respectively), and 
hypersensitivity (6 in the vaccine group including 1 related, 4 in the placebo group of which none 
related). Moreover, since the data lock, a SUSAR was reported which meet the Brighton Collaboration 
case definition criteria for anaphylaxis from an ongoing study in South Africa. Hypersensitivity, rash, 
urticaria, and anaphylaxis are considered at least possibly causally related to vaccination and have 
thus been listed as ADRs in the SmPC. Anaphylaxis is also considered as an important identified risk in 
the RMP. 
Regarding immune-mediated neurological disorders, there was 1 subject with Guillain-Barré syndrome 
in each group (1 possibly related grade 4 SAE in the Ad26.COV2.S group with a plausible temporal 
relationship, 1 non-related SAE in placebo group). The risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome is included in 
the list of AESIs taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
There were 3 cases of Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) in the Ad26.COV2.S group (2 SAE considered as 
possibly related SAEs by the investigator, but not related by the Sponsor; and 1 non-related AE) 
compared with 2 cases in the placebo group (non-related). Based on data from reported events, a 
causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and Bell’s palsy could not be confirmed nor ruled 
out (at least 2 cases possibly related to the vaccine). Bell’s palsy is included in the list of AESIs subject 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 38/43 
 
 
 
to routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities, but not in the SmPC as there is no clear 
imbalance vs. placebo. 
A numerical imbalance was observed for the venous thrombotic events with 11 subjects in the 
Ad26.COV2.S group (6 DVT events, 4 pulmonary embolism, 1 transverse sinus thrombosis (later 
classified as TTS); 6 SAEs; 8 events occurred within 28 days following vaccination) vs. 4 in the placebo 
group (2 DVT events, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 thrombosed haemorrhoid; 2 SAEs; all within 28 days 
of vaccination). Two of these cases were considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator (1 
in each group). However, as the majority of the participants had underlying medical conditions (such 
as obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes) that could have contributed to the thrombotic and 
thromboembolic events, the causal relationship between Ad26.COV2.S vaccination and venous 
thrombotic events was not shown. Venous thromboembolism has been included as an important 
potential risk in the list of safety concerns of the RMP. 
Asthma was reported for 7 participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group versus 1 participant in the placebo 
group, although most were unrelated to study treatment. In the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders, 10 subjects reported 10 SAEs in the Ad26.COV2.S group (3 Pulmonary embolism, 2 
Dyspnoea, 2 Hypoxia, 1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1 Pleural effusion, 1 Pneumothorax 
spontaneous) compared to 4 subjects reporting 6 SAEs in the placebo group (Pulmonary embolism, 
Dyspnoea, Cough, Oropharyngeal pain, Respiratory distress, Respiratory failure). Although the 
causality is not clear, because there is an imbalance in the number of cases vs. placebo, the risk of 
exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders (i.e. asthma and COPD) might be further monitored in the 
planned PASS as an AESI (pending feasibility assessment that will be included in the draft protocol). 
Post-marketing data 
Since the initial safety assessment at the time of the conditional MA, additional information became 
available through routine safety pharmacovigilance activities (such as signal detection, MSSRs) for 
which the results were reflected in updates of the EU-RMPs and SmPC during the reporting period. 
Important identified/potential risks: 
Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS): The EUPI has been updated to include TTS as an 
adverse reaction and text was added to Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, and the 
EU-RMP has been amended to include TTS as an Important Identified Risk, based on 
spontaneous/solicited post-marketing reports of severe and very rare cases of thrombosis in 
combination with thrombocytopenia, including venous thrombosis such as CVST, splanchnic vein 
thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis (EMEA/H/C/005737/IA/0004 and 
EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0006/G). 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS): The SmPC, Section 4.8 Undesirable effects was updated to include 
GBS as an ADR following vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, with frequency grouping "very rare" and given 
the seriousness of the event. Text was added to Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 
to advise that healthcare professionals should be alert of GBS signs and symptoms to ensure correct 
diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment and to rule out other causes 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0012). The list of safety concerns in the EU-RMP has been updated in version 
2.2 (submitted 03 August 2021) to include GBS as an Important Identified Risk, following the 
assessment of the data submitted as part of the procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0012. 
Thrombocytopenia / Immune Thrombocytopenia: In line with recommendations from the PRAC, 
received on 05 August 2021 in response to the MSSR (EMEA/H/C/005737/MEA/014.3), the MAH has 
submitted a Type II variation on August 25, 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0020) to update the SmPC, to 
include ITP as an ADR with a frequency "not known" (Section 4.8 of the SmPC). A warning and 
precaution statement relating to observation of very low platelet levels following vaccination with 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/757560/2021  
Page 39/43 
 
 
 
Ad26.COV2.S is proposed to be included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. A second statement was added on 
healthcare professionals assessing an individual’s relevant medical history. A third statement was 
included on alerting of healthcare professionals to signs and symptoms of ITP, and a recommendation 
was included to monitor platelet levels in patients with a history of ITP. 
As an outcome of the June 2021 MSSR assessment (EMEA/H/C/005737/MEA/014.3), the PRAC 
requested to include thrombocytopenia as an Important Identified Risk. Discussion on the re-
classification of risk of thrombocytopenia and ITP is currently ongoing (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0018).  
Other new recognized ADRs: 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS): Considering the occurrence of a new flare of CLS, with fatal outcome, 
in an individual with a medical history of CLS, in close temporal association with administration of 
Ad26.COV2.S, a causal role of the vaccine in severe exacerbations of CLS in individuals with a medical 
history of CLS cannot be excluded. The EUPI has been updated to include a contraindication (Section 
4.3) for individuals who have previously experienced episodes of CLS; CLS was added to Section 4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use and to Section 4.8 Undesirable effects as an ADR with the 
frequency category “Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)” 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0010). The MAH continues to monitor CLS and includes an interval review in the 
MSSRs. 
Lymphadenopathy: Based on the cumulative review of post-marketing reports of lymphadenopathy 
captured in the GMS database and scientific literature, there is a reasonable plausibility of an 
association between the occurrence of lymphadenopathy and the use of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. The 
MAH has submitted a Type II variation on 23 July 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014), which was 
approved on 03 September 2021, and in which updates are made to the SmPC Section 4.8 and the PL, 
Section 4, to include lymphadenopathy as an ADR, with a frequency " rare." 
Tinnitus: Based on the imbalance from the clinical study database, and available post marketing data, 
there is sufficient evidence to conclude on at least a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship 
between tinnitus and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. A Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/005737/II0014) was 
submitted on 23 July 2021 and approved on 03 September 2021 to include tinnitus as an ADR to 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency “rare”. As agreed with EMA, the discussion and presentation 
of available data with regards to further characterization of tinnitus will be handled as part of the 
upcoming MSSRs planned for submission on 15 September 2021. 
Diarrhoea: The EUPI has now been updated to include diarrhoea as an ADR, based on biological 
plausibility and disproportionate post marketing reporting. A Type II variation was submitted on 23 
July 2021, approved 03 September 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014) to update the SmPC Section 4.8 
to include diarrhoea as an ADR with a frequency "uncommon." 
Vomiting: On the basis of the disproportionality of post marketing reporting of vomiting and evidence 
of causality, the MAH has submitted an EU SmPC Type II variation filed on 23 July 2021 and approved 
03 September 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0014) to update the SmPC Section 4.8, to include vomiting 
as an ADR, with a frequency "rare." 
Hypoesthesia and Paraesthesia: Based on the disproportionality of post marketing reporting of 
paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia and evidence of causality, the MAH has submitted an EU SmPC Type II 
variation filed on 23 July 2021 and approved 3 September 2021, in which it proposes to update the 
SmPC Section 4.8, to include paraesthesia as an ADR with a frequency rate of "uncommon" and 
hypoaesthesia as an ADR with a frequency "rare."

Dizziness: Based on disproportionate reporting in the post marketing setting, the MAH has submitted a 
Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0020) with a proposal to update the EUPI to include dizziness 
in the list of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Venous Thromboembolism: VTE has been kept under close monitoring by PRAC due to a higher 
proportion of cases of VTE observed in the vaccinated group compared with the placebo group in the 
large clinical trial used to authorise COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. When taking all evidence into account, 
PRAC concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that VTE is linked to vaccination with COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen. PRAC therefore recommended adding VTE to the product information of COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen as a rare side effect (i.e. occurring in less than 1 in 1,000 individuals), together with 
warnings for healthcare professionals and people taking the vaccine, especially those who may have an 
increased risk of VTE (EMEA/H/C/005737/MEA/032). The RMP should be updated at the next 
regulatory opportunity with upgrading of ‘venous thromboembolism’ from important potential risk to 
important identified risk. The MAH’s proposal for further characterisation of VTE should also be 
addressed in an upcoming submission. 
Transverse myelitis (procedure ongoing): PRAC recommended that transverse myelitis (inflammation 
in parts of the spinal cord) should be added to the product information as a side effect of COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen (with a frequency of not known). This conclusion is based on worldwide transverse 
myelitis cases spontaneously reported by 31 August 2021, of which 10 have been assessed to have at 
least a possible causal relationship with the vaccine, and 1 a probable causal relationship (more than 
33 million doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen were estimated to have been administered worldwide by 
31 August 2021).  
Evaluations of the unfavourable effects Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and Rhabdomyolysis are 
ongoing. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Based on the post-marketing safety data submitted which have emerged in the reporting interval, and 
given that the clinical SOB has not been fulfilled yet (final CSR COV3001 due by December 2023), the 
uncertainties about unfavourable effects remain identical to the initial assessment, as described in the 
EPAR. These uncertainties are mainly related to long term-safety, co-administration with other 
vaccines and safety in specific risk groups (e.g. pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, 
frail patients with comorbidities). The RMP contains additional pharmacovigilance activities to further 
characterise these uncertainties.  
Of note, in the initial conditional MA application, the cumulative review of SAEs, pregnancy data, and 
neuroinflammatory adverse events with the Ad26 platform data (AdVac V5.0 database) have been 
assessed through the cut-off date of 21 Dec 2020. The data through the 31 Dec 2020 were assessed 
since the initial conditional MA (EMEA/H/C/005737/REC/19: AdVac V6.0 database) but didn’t change 
the conclusions above. The data through the 31 July 2021 are currently assessed 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/REC/34: AdVac V7.0 database).

Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite increasing numbers of vaccinated subjects, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains a 
public health issue of international concern. Effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines remain a pivotal tool 
for controlling the disease. 
Ad26.COV2.S has demonstrated high efficacy against severe/critical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 
and protection against COVID-19 related hospitalization and death in the trials that lead to MA. There 
is no new efficacy data available since MA. 
As of 31 July 2021, over 25.7 million doses of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine have been administered (CDC 
2021, ECDC 2021, KDCA 2021). Increasing experience based on spontaneous/solicited post-marketing 
reporting of adverse events, have led to the identification of new, some serious, adverse 
events/reactions (including new recognized ADRs in currently published SmPC: TTS, GBS, CLS, 
lymphadenopathy, paraesthesia and hypoesthesia, dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and tinnitus, VTE, 
ITP and transverse myelitis which is recommended to be included in ADR table in ongoing procedure) 
for which causality with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been concluded, based on the available data. 
These risks occur very infrequently, are adequately monitored and do not outweigh the significant 
benefits of single-dose vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S in controlling the global pandemic. Potential 
safety concerns will continue to be monitored. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
Taking the new safety information into account since approval of the conditional MA up to 31 July 
2021, and late breaking information, as presented in the Clinical Overview Addendum, the overall 
benefit-risk assessment remains favourable for Ad26.COV2.S when used as recommended in the 
currently approved indication of active immunization to prevent COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-
COV-2 virus in adults ≥18 years of age. 
7.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, 
the marketing authorisation holder has complied with the specific obligations and the benefit-risk 
balance for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in its approved indication(s) (please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable and therefore the renewal of the conditional 
marketing authorisation is recommended, subject to the conditions and obligations as detailed in this 
assessment report. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
The renewal requires no amendments to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
Conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions:

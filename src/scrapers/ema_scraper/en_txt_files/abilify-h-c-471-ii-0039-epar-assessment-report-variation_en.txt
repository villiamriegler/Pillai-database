1.1 
Introduction 
Bipolar  I  Disorder  is  a  lifelong  episodic  illness  characterized  by  manic  or  depressive  episodes 
followed by symptom-free periods. Psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders) 
often accompany the manic phase of bipolar disorder. The lifetime prevalence  of bipolar disorder is 
estimated  to  be  0.4%  to  1.6%.  The  mean  age  at  onset  for  a  first  manic  episode  is  the  early  20’s. 
Effective treatment of acute mood episodes in Bipolar I Disorder is important. However, preventing or 
delaying subsequent mood episodes should be a primary objective in effectively treating this illness.  
The  updated  Expert  Consensus  Guidelines1  recommend  lithium  or  valproate  as  first-line  therapy  for 
the  treatment  of  manic  symptoms  associated  with  Bipolar  I  Disorder.  When  monotherapy  fails,  the 
guidelines recommend combination therapies.   
In  addition,  antipsychotic  drugs  are  effective  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  manic  episodes. 
Typical  antipsychotic  drugs  such  as  haloperidol  are  associated  with  adverse  effects  such  as 
extrapyramidal  symptoms  (EPS),  tardive  dyskinesia,  and  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome.  Atypical 
antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone generally have less EPS but are 
associated  with  other  safety  concerns,  such  as  QT  interval  prolongation,  hyperprolactinemia  and 
weight gain.  
In  this  type  II  variation,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  applied  for  an  extension  of 
indication of Abilify: 
‘for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention 
of a new manic episode in patients whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment’. 
Consequential  changes  were  made  to  relevant  sections  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics 
(SPC). The Package Leaflet (PL) was updated accordingly. 
This application does not concern Abilify 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection. 
1.2  Non clinical aspects 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
An ERA according to CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  June  2006)  was  submitted.  The  physiochemical 
properties  of  aripiprazole  are:  water  solubility  at  25ºC  of  0.00013w/v%;  negligible  vapour  pressure; 
octanol water distribution coefficient depending of the pH.  
In Phase I, based on the highest recommended dose of 30 mg of aripiprazole, a worst-case Predicted 
Environmental  Concentration  (PEC)  in  surface  water  of  0.150  µg/L  was  calculated  using  default 
values. The calculated PEC in surface water was higher than the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and a Phase 
II  environmental  fate  and  effects  analysis  was  performed  based  on  the  available  ecotoxicity  data 
studies. The outstanding aquatic ecotoxicity studies are in progress or scheduled. 
Essential  tier  A  aquatic  ecotoxicity  studies  are  undergoing  (Aerobic  &  anaerobic  transformation  in 
aquatic sediment system (OECD 308), Adsorption/desorption to soil and sludge (OECD 106), Chronic 
toxicity  to  water  flea  (Daphnia  magna)  (OECD  211)  and  Chronic  toxicity  to  Fathead  Minnows 
(Pimephales promelas) embryos (OECD 210).

Having considered that the submitted ERA included a phase II tier A analysis not yet completed, the 
MAH committed to provide the final results of the studies by 1Q2008 (OECD 106, OECD 211) and 
2Q2008 (OECD 308,  OECD 210, effect on sediment organism) and further information related to the 
calculation of the penetration factor (Fpen) refinement as part of follow up measures (FUM). 
1.3  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Clinical Efficacy 
With reference to the  CHMP Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for 
the  Treatment  and  Prevention  of  Bipolar  Disorder  (CPMP/EWP/567/98,  April  2001),  the  MAH 
proposed  a  clinical  program  that  incorporated  all  elements  of  the  outlined  EU  requirements  for 
treatment and maintenance of patients with Bipolar I disorder, including the demonstration of efficacy 
at Week 3 and the maintenance of this effect over an additional 9-week period, as well as the efficacy 
and safety of aripiprazole as add on therapy to mood stabilizers.  
Additionally,  the  maintenance  treatment  study  CN138010  provided  in  this  application  is  supporting 
the claim ‘for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the 
prevention  of  a  new  manic  episode  in  patients  whose  manic  episodes  responded  to  aripiprazole 
treatment.’ 
1.  Three-Week Placebo-Controlled Comparisons 
METHODS 
Study design 
• 
•  CN138007:  A  3-week,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  fixed-dose  (3 parallel 
treatment  groups:  15  mg/day  aripiprazole,  30  mg/day  aripiprazole,  and  placebo)  study  in 
hospitalized patients with Bipolar I Disorder, manic- or mixed-type.  
At  the  end  of  Week  2,  patients  with  Clinical  Global  Impressions-Bipolar  (CGI-BP)  Change 
from  Preceding  Phase  (mania)  score  of  4  to  7  (no change  to  very  much  worse)  were  dropped 
from  the  blinded  placebo-controlled  treatment  phase  and  offered  the  option  to  receive  open-
label  aripiprazole  (30  mg  with  dose  decreased  to  15  mg  if  needed  based  on  tolerability)  for 
Week  3.  These  patients  and  those  who  completed  3  weeks  of  double-blind  therapy  were 
eligible to enter 1 of 2 long-term studies (CN138010 or CN138037). 
CN138009:  A  3-week,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  flexible-dose  study  in 
hospitalized  patients  with  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  manic-  or  mixed-type.  Patients  randomized  to 
aripiprazole were started at a dose of 30 mg/day, with the option to decrease to 15 mg/day based 
on tolerability, and to subsequently increase to 30 mg/day based on clinical response at any time 
during the study.  
At the end of Week 2, patients with CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase (mania) score of 4 
to  7  (no  change  to  very  much  worse)  were  dropped  from  the  blinded  placebo-controlled 
treatment  phase  and  offered  the  option  to  receive  open-label  aripiprazole  (30  mg  with  dose 
decreased to 15mg if needed based on tolerability) for Week 3. These patients and those who 
completed 3 weeks of double-blind therapy were eligible to enter 1 of 2 long-term studies 
(CN138010 or CN138037). 
CN138074:  Identical  design  as  CN138009  except  this  study  did  not  include  the  open-label 
treatment option for Week 3.  
•

• 
This study did not require patients with CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase (mania) Score 4 
to 7 to drop out at the end of Week 2. Patients could continue the study as outpatients during 
Week 3 if the following criteria were met at the end of Week 2: CGI BP Severity (mania) Score 
≤ 3 and CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase (mania) Score ≤ 2. All patients who completed 
3 weeks of double-blind therapy were eligible to enter 1 of 2 long-term studies (CN138010 
or CN138037). 
CN138135  and  CN138162:  A  12  week,  randomized,  double  blind,  placebo  controlled  and 
active controlled flexible dose study(3 parallel treatment groups: aripiprazole (starting dose 
of  15 mg/day  with  an  option  to  increase  to  30 mg/day),  placebo,  or  active-control 
treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio, for 3 weeks) in hospitalized patients with Bipolar I disorder, manic 
or mixed type.  
CN138135 used lithium (starting dose  of 900 mg/day with option to increase to 1200 mg/day 
and 1500 mg/day) and CN138162 used haloperidol (starting dose of 5 mg/day with an option to 
increase to 10 mg/day and 15 mg/day) as active controls for assay sensitivity.  
Patients were hospitalized at or before randomization, but could be discharged from the hospital 
and  could  continue  the  study  as  outpatients  at  the  end  of  Week  2  if  criteria  specified  in  the 
protocol were met.  
Sample size 
These studies were powered at 90% to detect a difference of 5.5 between placebo and aripiprazole on 
the mean change from baseline to Week 3, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), in the Young 
Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) Total Score. The assumed standard deviation was 13.4. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  3  on  the  Y-MRS  Total 
Score.  
Secondary and other efficacy endpoints 
The secondary efficacy measures were the mean change from baseline to Week 3 on CGI-BP Severity 
of Illness (mania) score and the response rate (defined as a decrease of ≥ 50% from baseline on the Y-
MRS Total Score). 
Other  efficacy  measures  mainly  included  mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  Positive  and  Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Hostility Subscale Score and mean CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase 
(mania). 
In  studies  CN138007  and  CN138009,  secondary  efficacy  measures  were  also  the  rate  of 
discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or entry into the open-label aripiprazole phase at Week 2 with a 
CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase (mania) score of 4 to 7.  
RESULTS 
Patient distribution 
The  Efficacy  Sample  comprised  1900  patients  in  the  3-week  placebo-controlled  comparisons 
(CN138007, CN138009, CN138074, CN138135, and CN138162). Of these 1900 patients, 856 were in 
the aripiprazole group and 719 were in the placebo group, the remaining 325 were in active control 
groups. (see Table 1)

Table 1 
Baseline Psychiatric Characteristics 
At baseline of the placebo-controlled comparisons, the mean age at the start of the current episode was 
40.0 years and the number of patients experiencing a manic-type episode was twice (67%) the number 
of patients experiencing a mixed-type episode (33%).  
Ten percent of the total randomized patients were rapid cyclers.  
Mean baseline score on the Y-MRS Total Score was 28.4, mean CGI-BP severity of Illness (Mania) 
was 4.6, and mean PANSS Total Score was 62.6. These scores characterize a moderately to severely 
ill population. (see Table 2) 
Table 2 
Extent of Exposure 
In studies CN138009 and CN138074, 261 patients (125 and 136, respectively) received a starting dose 
of 30  mg/day of aripiprazole with the  option to decrease to 15  mg/day, based on tolerability. Sixty-
three (50.4%) patients in study CN138009 and 82 (60.3%) patients in study CN138074 remained on 
study for > 2 weeks.

In studies CN138135 and CN138162, 320 patients (154 and 166, respectively) received a starting dose 
of 15 mg/day of aripiprazole with an option to increase to 30 mg/day. Ninety-eight (63.6%) patients in 
study CN138135 and 144 (86.7%) patients in study CN138162 remained on study for >2 weeks. 
In  study  CN138007,  256  patients  received  fixed  doses  of  aripiprazole  (127  patients  received 
15 mg/day and 129 received 30 mg/day). The retention rate in study CN138007 was similar across all 
3 treatment groups (45.7% to 49.6%). (see Tables 3, 4)

2.  Maintenance of Effect Studies 
METHODS 
Study design 
• 
• 
• 
CN138135: following the 3 week treatment (either aripiprazole (starting dose of 15 mg/day with 
an option to increase to 30 mg/day on Day 4 or beyond), placebo, or lithium (starting dose of 
900 mg/day with option to increase to 1200 mg/day at Day 4 and 1500 mg/day at Day 7) in a 
1:1:1 ratio), patients were receiving either double-blind aripiprazole or lithium for an additional  
9 weeks.  
At any time during the study, the patient’s aripiprazole or lithium dose could be decreased for 
tolerability  reasons.  Patients  randomized  to  placebo  were  blindly  switched  to  receive 
aripiprazole treatment at the end of Week 3 (these patients were not included in the maintenance 
of effect analyses).  
All  patients  continuing  in  the  study  were  expected  to  be  discharged  from  the  hospital  as  of 
Week  3.  Patients  completing  12  weeks  of  double-blind  study  medication  had  the  option  to 
continue on blinded study medication (aripiprazole or lithium) for an additional extension phase 
of 40 weeks.  
CN138162: Identical design as CN138135 except haloperidol was used as an active control and 
there was no extension phase. The starting dose of haloperidol was 5 mg/day with an option to 
increase to 10 mg/day and 15 mg/day. 
CN138008: A flexible-dose active-controlled study with a 12-week acute phase and a 14-week 
extension phase comparing aripiprazole (15 mg/day to 30 mg/day) with haloperidol (10 mg/day 
to  15 mg/day)  in  outpatients  or  inpatients  with  a  diagnosis  of  Bipolar  I  Disorder  who  were 
experiencing an acute manic episode.  
Patients with a CGI-BP (mania) Change from Preceding Phase Score of ≥ 3 at the end of Weeks 
1 or 2 could increase their dose of aripiprazole from 15 mg to 30 mg or haloperidol from 10 mg 
to 15 mg.  
At the end of the initial 3-week period, patients meeting eligibility criteria (CGI-BP Severity of 
Illness  [mania]  Score  <  4  and  Montgomery  Asberg  Depression  Rating  Scale  (MADRS)  Total 
Score < 18) continued in the same treatment group at the same dose level for the remainder of 
the study. The dose of study medication could not be increased during subsequent weeks of the 
study, but could be decreased to 15 mg of aripiprazole or 10 mg of haloperidol, if necessary, for 
9
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tolerability.  Patients  not  tolerating  these  lower  doses  were  to  be  discontinued  from  the  study. 
Anticholinergic medications were not permitted in this study. Patients who completed this 12-
week portion of the study and met prespecified criteria could continue treatment in a 14-week, 
double-blind extension phase. 
Sample size 
CN138008 was powered at 90% to detect a treatment difference of 19% in the proportion of patients 
in response and on treatment at Week 12, between the aripiprazole group (54%) and the haloperidol 
group (35%). This assumed a 2-sided test at the 0.05 level. The estimated percentages of patients in 
response  and  on  treatment  at  Week  12  were  derived  from  an  estimated  response  rate  at  the  end  of 
Week  3  of  60%  in  the  aripiprazole  group  versus  50%  in  the  haloperidol  group,  and  the  estimated 
number of patients who either dropped out after the end of Week 3 or were not in response at the end 
of Week 12 (10% in the aripiprazole group and 30% in the haloperidol group). 
Primary efficacy endpoint (study CN138008) 
The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  the  number  of  patients  who  completed  Week  12  and  were  in 
response at the end of Week 12 (at least 50% improvement from baseline Y-MRS).  
Secondary and other efficacy endpoints 
CN138008 
The  main  secondary  outcome  measures  were  the  response  rate  at  Week  3  and  at  Week  12  in  the 
subgroup of patients who had a CGI-BP (mania) Severity Score < 4 and a MADRS Total Score < 18 at 
Week  3;  the  remission  rate  at  Week  12  (safety  sample),  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
completed Week 12 with a Y-MRS Total Score < 12; time to discontinuation for any reason (safety 
sample)  and  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  70%  improvement  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  Total 
Score at Week 3. 
Other efficacy analyses included the mean changes from baseline to each specified visit in the Y-MRS 
Total Score, the CGI-BP Severity of Illness (mania, depression, and overall) Scores, the PANSS Total 
Score, the PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score, the PANSS Hostility Subscale Score, and the MADRS 
Total Score. 
CN138135 and CN138162 
The  main  secondary  efficacy  measures  were  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  12  on  the  Y-
MRS  Total  Score,  on  CGI-BP  Severity  of  Illness  (mania)  score  and  the  response  rate  (defined  as  a 
decrease of ≥ 50% from baseline on the Y-MRS Total Score). 
RESULTS 
For studies CN138135 and CN138162, patient distribution and baseline psychiatric characteristics are 
described under the section for the 3 week placebo controlled comparisons. 
Patient distribution 
In  study  CN138008,  347  patients  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment:  175 patients  to  the 
aripiprazole group and 172 patients to the haloperidol group. Nine of the 347 patients randomized to 
treatment were excluded from the Efficacy Sample, resulting in a total of 338 patients in the Efficacy 
Sample (174 aripiprazole-treated and 164 haloperidol-treated).  
Baseline Psychiatric Characteristics 
More patients experienced a manic-type episode than a mixed-type episode at baseline. The treatment 
groups were similar on the baseline ratings scales.

Extent of Exposure 
In study CN138135, the mean daily dose of aripiprazole in the first week of the double-blind treatment 
phase  was  17.1 mg/day.  Thereafter  through  Day  91  of  treatment,  the  weekly  mean  daily  dose  was 
between 23.2 and 26.6 mg/day. During Week 12 (Days 78-84), 26.6% of patients in the aripiprazole 
group and 35.5% patients in the lithium group were still on treatment. At Week 3 (LOCF), 44.2% of 
aripiprazole patients were receiving a dosage of 15 mg/day. 
In study CN138162, the mean daily dose of aripiprazole in the first week of the double-blind treatment 
phase  was  17.8 mg/day  and  the  weekly  mean  daily  dose  through  Day  91  was  between  22.0  and 
23.7 mg/day. During Week 12 (Days 78-84), approximately 58% of patients in the aripiprazole and the 
haloperidol  group  were  still  on  treatment.  At  Week  3  (LOCF),  41.6%  of  aripiprazole  patients  were 
receiving a dosage of 15 mg/day. 
In  study  CN138008,  the  mean  daily  dose  of  aripiprazole  was  21.5 mg  and  of  haloperidol  was  10.7 
mg.at  endpoint.    At  Week  12  (Days  78-84),  52.6%  of  aripiprazole-treated  patients  and  30.2%  of 
haloperidol-treated patients were still on treatment.

3.  Maintenance Treatment Studies for the Prevention of Recurrence  
METHODS 
Study design 
• 
CN138010: This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled 
study of aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment for the prevention of recurrence of Bipolar I 
Disorder.  
There  were  2  routes  of  entry  into  this  study.  Patients  who  had  experienced  a  manic-or  mixed-type 
episode  and  had  recently  completed  an  acute  mania  study  of  aripiprazole  were  eligible  to  enter  and 
also patients who had recently experienced a manic or mixed-type episode but had not participated in 
an aripiprazole study were eligible to enter this study.  
The  study  consisted  of  3  phases  :  Stabilization  phase:  Open-label  treatment  with  aripiprazole  at  a 
starting dose of 30 mg/day; could be decreased to 15 mg/day at any time, if necessary, for tolerability. 
Duration was from 6 to 18 weeks with visits every 2 weeks. Patients continued in this phase until their 
manic  symptoms  were  stable  as  defined  by  prespecified  criteria  (Y-MRS  Total  Score  ≤  10  and  a 
MADRS  Total  Score  ≤  13  during  4  consecutive  visits)  over  a  minimum  of  6  weeks.  Maintenance 
phase:  Once  stabilized,  eligible  patients  were  then  randomized  to  aripiprazole  or  placebo.  Patients 
assigned  to  aripiprazole  started  this  phase  at  the  same  dose  they  were  taking  at  the  end  of  the 
Stabilization phase. The dose of aripiprazole was 15  mg/day or 30 mg/day and could be changed at 
any time during the study, as necessary, based on therapeutic effect and tolerability.  
Patients  were  discontinued  from  the  study  because  of  lack  of  efficacy  if  they  were  hospitalized  for 
manic  or  depressive  symptoms,  or  required  an  addition  to  or  increase  in  their  psychotropic 
medications  other  than  study  medication  (ie,  predefined  criteria  for  relapse).  Benzodiazepines 
(lorazepam  unless  not  locally  available)  were  the  only  psychotrophic  medications  allowed  in  the 
maintenance phase, and only in small doses and limited frequency. Patients continued in this phase of 
the study for up to 26 weeks.  
Eligible patients continued on the blinded study drug treatment they were receiving at the end of the 
maintenance phase, either aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) or placebo, and their dose could be adjusted 
at  any  time  during  the  study,  as  necessary,  to  enhance  therapeutic  effect  or  tolerability.  Patients 
continued in the extension phase of the study for up to 74 weeks. Criteria for relapse in this extension 
phase were the same as in the maintenance phase. Patients unable to tolerate the lowest dose of study 
medication or who relapsed at any time during the phase were discontinued. 
Sample size 
It was expected that the 6-month placebo relapse rate would be 45% and that the aripiprazole relapse 
rate would be 20%. A total of 45 events would be required to yield 87% power to detect the expected 
25% difference in the percentage of patients relapsing between placebo and the aripiprazole treatment 
groups, assuming these relapse rates, a drop-out rate for reasons other than relapse of 18%, and a 2-
sided  test  at  the  0.05  level.  One  hundred  and  fifty  two  patients  were  expected  to  be  randomized  to 
obtain 150 evaluable patients (75 per treatment group) to yield 45 events (total number of patients who 
relapsed).  The  hazard  ratio  for  these  relapse  rates  and  sample  size  was  2.7  based  on  a  ratio  of 
placebo/aripiprazole. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was the time to relapse (as defined by discontinuation due to 
lack of efficacy) from randomization into the Maintenance Phase.  
Other  efficacy  measures  mainly  included  the  mean  change  from  randomization  to  endpoint  in  the 
Y-MRS  Total  Score,  the  MADRS  Total  Score,  the  Positive  and  Negative  Symptom  Scale  (PANSS) 
13
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total Score, the PANSS Cognitive Subscale Score, the PANSS Hostility Subscale Score, the Clinical 
Global Impressions-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) Severity Scores, and the mean at endpoint in the CGI-
BP Change from Preceding Phase Scores. In addition, time from randomization to relapse during the 
combined Maintenance and Extension Phases was assessed. 
RESULTS 
Baseline Psychiatric Characteristics 
Within  the  Randomized  Sample,  the  treatment  groups  were  balanced  for  all variables  except  for  the 
proportion  of  patients  experiencing  a  manic-type  episode  which  was  78%  in  the  placebo  group  and 
62% in the aripiprazole group. More patients experienced a manic-type episode (70%) than a mixed-
type episode (30%) at baseline. 
Patients  entered  the  maintenance  phase  when  they  were  determined  to  be  stable  over  a  period  of  6 
consecutive weeks (in the stabilization phase) as defined by prespecified criteria (Y-MRS Total Score 
≤ 10 and a MADRS Total Score ≤ 13 during 4 consecutive visits). 
Extent of Exposure 
The  mean  daily  dose  for  aripiprazole-treated  patients  at  the  endpoint  of  the  maintenance  phase  was 
24.29 mg/day. Overall, the mean daily dose of aripiprazole remained constant throughout the 26-week 
maintenance phase.

Extension phase : Maintenance of Treatment Greater than 1 Year 
A  total  of  67  patients  completed  the  maintenance  phase,  66  of  these  patients  entered  the  extension 
phase. These patients were followed for relapse during the extension phase for an additional period of 
up  to  17  months  or  a  total  of  up  to  23  months  from  randomization  in  the  maintenance  phase.  The 
prespecified analysis of time from randomization to relapse (as defined by discontinuation due to lack 
of  efficacy)  for  a  period  greater  than  1  year  was  evaluated  during  the  combined  maintenance  and 
extension phases.  
Consistent  with  findings  in  the  maintenance  phase,  aripiprazole  was  superior  to  placebo  in  delaying 
the  time  to  relapse  during  the  combined  maintenance  and  extension  phases,  further  supporting  the 
efficacy  of  aripiprazole  in  maintaining  the  effect  in  prevention  of  relapse  in  patients  with  Bipolar  I 
Disorder. The proportion of relapses was lower in the aripiprazole group (32%) than the placebo group 
(52%).  Aripiprazole  treatment  reduced  the  risk  of  relapse  compared  to  placebo  by  nearly  half  as 
indicated by the hazard ratio: 0.531, 95% CI (0.324, 0.871).  
4.  6-Week Combination Therapy Study 
Study design 
• 
CN138134:  This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  flexible-dose,  placebo-
controlled study with 2 parallel treatment groups.  
Patients  who  were  partially  nonresponsive  to  lithium  or  valproate  monotherapy  were  randomly 
assigned  to  receive  either  aripiprazole  or  placebo  in  a  2:1  ratio,  in  combination  with  lithium  or 
valproate for 6 weeks.  
15
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients considered appropriate by the investigator (ie, able to be treatment compliant; might benefit 
from  longer-term  treatment)  could  continue  in  the  study  for  an  additional  46  weeks  on  open-label 
aripiprazole in combination with lithium or valproate.  
The study consisted of four phases. Phase 1: It was a 3-day to 4-week phase to achieve the therapeutic 
levels of lithium or valproate as well as screening and psychotropic washout phase. Patients who were 
receiving  lithium  or  valproate,  just  prior  to  entering  the  study  as  well  as  those  not  receiving  these 
treatments  prior  to  entering  the  study,  were  eligible  to  participate.  All  patients  received  lithium  or 
valproate during this phase. A Y-MRS total score of ≥ 16 was required for patients to enter Phase 2. 
Phase 2: This phase lasted 2 weeks and was used to confirm that patients were partially nonresponsive 
to mood stabilizers (defined by a Y-MRS Total Score ≥ 16 during Phase 1 and at the end of Phase 2, 
with  a  decrease  of  ≤  25%  between  Phases  1  and  2).  Phase  3:  Patients  who  met  partial  nonresponse 
criteria  were  randomized  to  receive  either  aripiprazole  or  placebo  in  combination  with  lithium  or 
ratio 
valproate 
(aripiprazole:placebo), stratified by mood stabilizer treatment and study center, and started treatment 
with either placebo or with aripiprazole at 15 mg/day with the option to increase to 30 mg/day at Day 
7 (Week 1) or beyond for clinical response. Phase 4: This was a 46-week open-label extension phase. 
Patients who completed the double-blind treatment phase could enter this phase with aripiprazole and 
either lithium or valproate.  
in  a  6-week,  double-blind  phase.  Patients  were 
randomized 
in  a  2:1 
Sample size 
Study CN138134 was powered at 90% to detect a difference of 3.23 in the mean change from baseline 
in Y-MRS at Week 6 between aripiprazole combined with lithium or valproate and placebo combined 
with  lithium  or  valproate.  This  assumed  a  standard  deviation  of  8.82  and  a  2-sided  t-test  for  the 
difference between aripiprazole and placebo at the 0.05 significance level.  
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline to Week 6 (LOCF) in the Y-MRS 
Total Score. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to Week  6  (LOCF)  in  the 
CGI-BP Severity of Illness Score (Mania). 
RESULTS 
Patient distribution 
There  were  384  patients  randomized  according  to  2:1  (aripiprazole:  placebo)  ratio  to  the  6-week 
combination treatment phase (Phase 3): 131 to the placebo group and 253 to the aripiprazole group. 
Seven of the 384 patients were excluded from the Efficacy Sample, resulting in a total of 377 patients 
in the Efficacy Sample. 
Baseline Psychiatric Characteristics 
The  mean  age  at  the  start  of  manic  or  mixed  symptoms  was  27.0  years;  75%  of  patients  were 
experiencing a manic-type episode and 25% were mixed-type episode at baseline. Therapeutic levels 
of lithium and valproate were confirmed at the end of medication washout Phase 1, prior to entering 
the mood stabilizer monotherapy Phase 2. In addition, only patients with a Y-MRS ≥ 16 were eligible 
to enter Phase 2.  
The mean Y-MRS Total Score was 23.9 at the end of Phase 1. The mean duration of Phase 1 mood 
stabilizer  dosing  was  18.9  days.  The  treatment  groups  were  similar  with  respect  to  the  baseline 
psychiatric evaluations.  
16
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  mean  baseline  (end  of  Phase  2)  Y-MRS  Total  Score  of  the  Randomized  Sample  was  23.1.  
The  mean  baseline  CGI-BP  Severity  of  Illness  Score  (mania)  for  all  randomized  patients  was  4.2. 
Baseline assessment scores of psychiatric rating scales were similar for the aripiprazole and placebo 
groups. Patients who were partially nonresponsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy were randomly 
assigned  in  a  2:1  ratio  (aripiprazole:placebo)  for  6 weeks  in  combination  with  lithium  or  valproate, 
stratified by mood stabilizer treatment; 41% of the randomized patients were on lithium and 59% were 
on valproate.  
Extent of Exposure 
For  the  aripiprazole-treated  patients,  the  mean  daily  dose  in  the  first  week  of  treatment  was 
15.5 mg/day. Thereafter to end of treatment in the double-blind phase the weekly mean daily dose was 
between  17.3  and  19.0  mg/day.  At  Week  6  (Days  36-42),  77.9  % of  aripiprazole-treated  and  88.5% 
placebo-treated patients were still on treatment.  
Efficacy endpoints 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline to Week 6 (Phase 3) in the Y-MRS 
Total  Score  (LOCF),  aripiprazole  added  to  lithium  or  valproate  showed  statistically  significantly 
greater improvement than placebo; the treatment difference was -2.62 (P = 0.002). 
For  the  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  6  in  CGI-BP 
Severity  of  Illness  score  (Mania)  (LOCF),  the  aripiprazole  group  showed  statistically  significantly 
greater improvement than the placebo group (treatment difference -0.33, P = 0.014). 
The aripiprazole group (aripiprazole in  combination with either lithium or valproate was superior to 
the placebo group (placebo in combination with either lithium or  valproate) on the primary efficacy 
endpoint, the mean change from baseline to Week 6 (Phase 3) in the Y-MRS Total Score (LOCF) and 
on the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the CGI-BP Severity of Illness (mania) Score (LOCF).  
There was a statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the mean CGI-BP Change 
from  Preceding  Phase  (Mania)  Score  favoring  aripiprazole  at  Week  6  (P = 0.037).  The  aripiprazole 
group was superior to the placebo group in PANSS hostility Subscale scores (P = 0.001). The mean 
changes from baseline to Week 6 in CGI-BP Severity of Illness (Depression) Score and in MADRS 
Total Score were similar between the aripiprazole group and the placebo group. 
The treatment-by-mood stabilizer interactions assessed at Week 6 for both the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints were not statistically significant (P = 0.332, and P = 0.203, respectively). 
5. 
Sensitivity analysis on patients without use of specified central nervous system (CNS) 
medications 
agents 
included 
The 
analgesics/antipyretics, 
anxiolytics, 
hypnotics/sedatives,  and  antipsychotics.  For  each  study,  an  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  (mean 
change from baseline to endpoint in Y-MRS Total Score) was conducted excluding patients who took 
any of these medications concomitantly with study medication.  
antiepileptics, 
opioids, 
other 
The subset of patients who did not use these concomitant medications showed statistically significant 
improvement  on  the  mean  Y-MRS  Total  Score  from  baseline  to  Week  3,  in  favour  of  aripiprazole 
versus  placebo  in  studies  CN138074  and  CN138162  (P = 0.003,  and  P = 0.011,  respectively).  In 
studies CN138009 and CN138135, the aripiprazole group showed greater improvement in the mean Y-
MRS Total Score from baseline to Week 3 than the placebo group; however, the difference was not 
statistically significant (P = 0.086 and P = 0.104, respectively). Study CN138007 was not included in 
this analysis because the purpose of  this sensitivity analysis was to  test the robustness of the results 
from positive studies when excluding patients who used these concomitant medications.

6. 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
1. Three-Week Placebo Controlled Comparisons 
There are 5 completed clinical studies directly relevant for the demonstration of efficacy at 3 weeks. 
Two  of  them  included  active  comparators  i.e  lithium  (CN138135)  or  haloperidol  (CN138162).  and 
were also designed to provide data for the 12 week endpoint. The primary endpoint in all the trial was 
the Young-Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scale and responders defined as improvement of 50% in that 
scale were also analysed.  
Study CN1380007 failed to discriminate from placebo. In this clinical study, the treated arm improved 
from  baseline  around  12  points  which  is  in  the  range  of  the  effect  expected  but  the  placebo  results 
were similar in this respect.  
All the other clinical studies showed consistently efficacy in the expected range and aripiprazole effect 
was similar to the one obtained with lithium and haloperidol.  
In all trials drop-outs rates were high in the range of 50 to 60% and about half of those were due to 
lack of response or lack of efficacy.  
Rates  of  responders  in  the  positive  studies  were  placebo  19%  vs  aripiprazole  40%  (CN138009); 
placebo  32%  vs  aripiprazole  53%  (CN138074);  placebo  34.4%  vs  lithium  45.8%  vs  aripiprazole 
46.8%(CN138135);  placebo  38.2%  vs  haloperidol  49.8%  vs  aripiprazole  47%  (CN138162).  The 
secondary endpoints were consistent with the effect seen in the YMRS and responders. 
2. Maintenance of Effect Studies 
• 
CN138135 
In the aripiprazole group, 20.0% of patients discontinued beyond end of Week 3 and 27.1% patients 
completed the 12-week double-blind phase. In the lithium group, 15.0% discontinued beyond end of 
Week 3 and 33.8% patients completed the 12-week double-blind phase. 
The treatment effect of aripiprazole observed at the end of Week 3 was maintained at Week 12, the 
same was true for the lithium group. 
The  improvement  in  mean  change  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  Week  3  in  Y-MRS  Total  Score  was 
maintained at Week 12 in the aripiprazole group (Week 3: -12.64, Week 12: -14.48) and the lithium 
group (Week 3: -12.03, Week 12: -12.71).  
The mean changes from baseline in Y-MRS Total Score were similar between the aripiprazole and the 
lithium group at Week 12.  
The proportion of responders (patients with ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in Y-MRS Total score) 
increased from Week 3 to Week 12 for both the aripiprazole group (Week 3: 46.8%, Week 12: 56.5%) 
and  the  lithium  group  (Week  3:  45.8%,  Week  12:  49.0%).  The  response  rate  was  higher  in  the 
aripiprazole than the lithium group at Week 12.  
The  percentages  of  patients  in  remission  (defined  as  a  Y-MRS  Total  score  ≤ 12)  increased  between 
Week 3 and Week 12, in the aripiprazole group (40.3% and 49.4%, respectively) and remained stable 
the lithium group (40.0% and 39.4%, respectively).  
• 
CN138162 
In  study  CN138162,  18.6%  patients  from  the  aripiprazole  and  15.8%  from  the  haloperidol  group 
discontinued beyond end of Week 3. The number of patients who completed the 12-week double-blind 
18
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phase  was  similar  for  the  aripiprazole  and  haloperidol  group  (aripiprazole,  56.9%  and  haloperidol, 
57.6%).  In  both  studies  CN138135  and  CN138162,  the  most  frequently  reported  reason  for 
discontinuation from treatment beyond end of Week 3 across the treatment groups was adverse event 
(AE). 
The  aripiprazole  and  the  haloperidol  groups  continued  to  show  improvement  at  all  timepoints  from 
Week 3 to Week 12. 
The effect observed at Week 3 was maintained at Week 12 in the aripiprazole group (Week 3: -11.98, 
Week 12: -17.16) and the haloperidol group (Week 3: -12.83, Week 12: -17.84).  
The  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  Y-MRS  Total  Score  at  Week  12  were  similar  between  the 
aripiprazole and the haloperidol group. 
The response rate was increased from Week 3 to Week 12 in both aripiprazole (Week 3: 47.0%, Week 
12: 72.3%) and the haloperidol groups (Week 3: 49.7%, Week 12: 73.9%). The response rates were 
similar between the aripiprazole and the haloperidol groups at Week 12.  
Remission rates were higher at Week 12 than Week 3 in both the aripiprazole (69.9% vs 44.0%) and 
the haloperidol group (71.4% vs 45.3%) and were similar between the treatment groups. 
Both studies CN138135 and CN138162 showed minimal improvement in MADRS Total Score from 
baseline to the end of Week 12 in the aripiprazole and the active control groups 
• 
CN138008 
In  study  CN138008,  aripiprazole  was  superior  to  haloperidol  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint, 
percentage of patients on-treatment and in response at Week 12 (P < 0.001).  
For the secondary efficacy measure of percentage of patients on-treatment and in response at the end 
of Week 3, the aripiprazole group showed a higher response (51%) compared to the haloperidol group 
(43%); however; the difference was not statistically significant.  
For the cohort of patients who continued in the study by meeting eligibility criteria at Week 3 (CGI-
BP Severity of Illness [mania] Score < 4 and MADRS Total Score < 18), the aripiprazole group (69%) 
was superior to the haloperidol group (55%) at the end of Week 12 (P = 0.048). 
The proportion of patients on-treatment and remission (Y-MRS Total Score < 12) was greater in the 
aripiprazole group (50%) than in the haloperidol group (28%) at Week 12 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, 
aripiprazole was superior to haloperidol (P < 0.001) in time to discontinuation for any reason.  
The mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the Y-MRS Total Score (LOCF) was similar between 
the aripiprazole and the haloperidol group. 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the data provided are supportive of the efficacy of aripiprazole in 
the treatment of the acute maniac episode. 
3. Maintenance Treatment Studies for the Prevention of Recurrence  
Although the combined maintenance and extension phases provided a period of evaluation that is more 
than  a  year,  the  primary  analysis  of  CN138010  evaluated  relapses  during  the  6  month  double-blind 
phase. The maintenance phase was 6 months in duration and was followed by a double-blind extension 
phase that continued for up to an additional 74 weeks (patients continued on the same drug and dose as 
in the maintenance phase). 
Given the results on the first 6 months and the 74 weeks double blind data, the CHMP considered that 
the overall study duration of CN138010 was acceptable. 
Additionally, the CHMP acknowledged that the use of an active comparator in recurrence prevention 
studies  can  be  of  methodologically  concern  due  to  possible  switch  or  use  of  combination  treatment 
19
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during the stabilisation phase. The MAH performed a literature review to further support the efficacy 
of aripiprazole as compared to other antipsychotics (lithium, lamotrigine, olanzapine, and valproate) in 
the treatment of any phase of Bipolar I disorder. Based on these data which included a meta analysis 
of  14 long  term  studies  conducted  with  other  antipsychotics,  the CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the 
overall data provided were acceptable. 
4. Six-Week Combination Therapy Study (CN138134) 
Study CN138134 evaluated aripiprazole in association with classical non neuroleptic mood-stabilizers 
as  observed  in  clinical  practice.  Results  showed  a  benefit  favouring  aripiprazole  15  to  30  mg.  The 
extension phase is currently ongoing. 
3.3.2 Clinical Safety 
A total of 2626 patients received aripiprazole tablets in the acute bipolar mania clinical trial program; 
13543 patients received aripiprazole tablets across all Phase 2/3/4 studies.Patients in the bipolar mania 
clinical  program  received  substantial  exposure  to  aripiprazole.  A  total  of  2626  patients  received  at 
least  one  dose  of  aripiprazole  treatment;  1895  received  aripiprazole  for  at  least  3  weeks;  and  1446 
received aripiprazole for at least 6 weeks. The number of patient exposure years was 546.8. 
In the bipolar mania studies, most aripiprazole-treated patients were distributed evenly in overall mean 
dose categories of >12.5 to ≤ 17.5 mg/day (36.3%) and >25.0 to ≤ 32.5 mg/day (39.2%), reflecting 15 
mg/day and 30 mg/day dose regimens, respectively. 
Patient exposure 
All aripiprazole dataset included data from a total of 13543 patients: bipolar mania (N = 2626), bipolar 
depression (N = 593), adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder (N = 1055), schizophrenia (N 
= 8215), and other disorders (N=1054).  
Overall, patient exposure years (PEY) totaled 7618.9, with 546.8 years for patients with bipolar mania. 
A total of 1895 bipolar mania patients received aripiprazole for at least 3 weeks, and 1446 received 
aripiprazole for at least 6 weeks. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
1. Three-Week Placebo-Controlled Comparisons  
Data  from  all  available  3-week  placebo-controlled  comparisons  in  bipolar  mania  were  derived  from 
917 patients treated with aripiprazole and 753 treated with placebo.  
The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  was  82.2%  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  71.7%  in  the 
placebo group. Events of akathisia, sedation, extrapyramidal disorder, and restlessness were reported 
at an incidence of ≥ 5% (including numbers that equaled or were greater than 5% after rounding) and 
twice that of placebo. 
In these pooled studies, the adverse drug reaction (ADR) profile of Abilify was similar to that reported 
in  the  schizophrenia  placebo-controlled  studies.  When  results  from  the  bipolar  mania  and 
schizophrenia placebo-controlled trials are combined, 3 new ADR terms not currently in the SPC meet 
criteria  (≥  1%  the  rate  in  the  placebo  group):  anxiety,  salivary  hypersecretion,  and  extrapyramidal 
disorder. 
2. Twelve-Week Active-Controlled Studies 
In the 12-week lithium-controlled study (CN138135), the aripiprazole group reported lower incidences 
than  the  lithium  group  of  tremor,  but  higher  incidences  of  akathisia,  sedation,  insomnia,  agitation, 
restlessness, dry mouth, musculoskeletal stiffness, and fatigue. 
20
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In  the  12-week  haloperidol-controlled  studies  (CN138162  and  CN138008),  the  aripiprazole  group 
reported  lower  incidences  relative  to  the  haloperidol  group  of  akathisia,  extrapyramidal  disorder, 
tremor, and parkinsonism,  with the latter 2 primarily reported in CN138008. The aripiprazole group 
reported higher incidences of nausea (primarily in CN138008) and mania (primarily in CN138162).  
3. Maintenance Treatment Study 
Data  from  the  maintenance  treatment  study  were  derived  from  77  patients  treated  with  aripiprazole 
and 83 treated with placebo during the maintenance phase. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs during the maintenance phase of CN138010 was similar for 
the aripiprazole (74.0%) and placebo (69.9%) groups. There was a higher incidence of ADRs in the 
aripiprazole group than the placebo group, which was largely accounted for by the higher incidence of 
tremor  (aripiprazole  7.8%,  placebo  1.2%)  and  musculoskeletal  stiffness  (aripiprazole  6.5%,  placebo 
1.2%). During the combined maintenance and extension phases, the incidences of ADRs were similar 
to those reported in the maintenance phase. 
4. Six-Week Combination Therapy Study 
Data from the 6-week combination therapy study were derived from 253 patients treated adjunctively 
with aripiprazole and lithium or valproate, and 130 treated adjunctively with placebo and lithium or 
valproate. 
In the combination therapy study of aripiprazole or placebo co-administered with lithium or valproate, 
the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was 62.1% for aripiprazole and 53.8% for placebo. 
AEs reported for patients in the aripiprazole group at ≥ 5% (including numbers that equaled or were 
greater  than  5%  after  rounding)  and  twice  that  of  placebo  included  akathisia,  insomnia,  and 
extrapyramidal disorder. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths, discontinuation due to adverse events 
1. Three-Week Placebo-Controlled Comparisons  
There was 1 death reported in an aripiprazole-treated patient (hydrocodone intoxication, unrelated to 
therapy).  
The incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was similar between treatment groups (6.0% aripiprazole, 
4.4%  placebo),  with  the  majority  of  events  occurring  in  the  system  organ  class  of  psychiatric 
disorders.  
The  rates  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  also  similar 
between treatment groups: 11.0% for the aripiprazole group and 9.6% for the placebo group. Mania 
and akathisia were the most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy in the 
aripiprazole group. 
2. Twelve-Week Active-Controlled Studies 
In study CN138135, no deaths were reported during the 12-week phase.  
In  study  CN138162,  two  deaths  (pulmonary  necrosis  and  lung  abscess)  were  reported  after  patients 
were randomized to placebo in the placebo-controlled phase and switched to aripiprazole after Week 3 
of the 12-week double-blind phase.  
The  rates  of  SAEs  were  higher  in  the  aripiprazole  groups  than  the  active-control  groups  in  study 
CN138162 (11.4% vs 3.0% haloperidol, respectively) and study CN138135 (12.3% vs 8.2% lithium, 
respectively), but lower than the haloperidol group in study CN138008 (2.3% vs 7.1%, respectively). 
Most events were reported in the system organ class of psychiatric disorders.  
21
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  in  CN138008 
was lower in the aripiprazole group than the haloperidol group (18.9% vs 49.1%), and higher than the 
haloperidol group in CN138162 (14.5% vs 10.9%).  
The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of aripiprazole treatment were akathisia 
and depression (primarily in study CN138008), and mania (primarily in studyCN138162).  
In  the  12-week  lithium-controlled  study  (CN138135),  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs 
leading  to discontinuation  of  study  therapy  was  20.1%  for  the  aripiprazole  group  and  17.6%  for  the 
lithium group. The  most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation of aripiprazole treatment 
was akathisia (3.2%). 
3. Maintenance Treatment Study 
There  was  one  death  for  an  aripiprazole-treated  patient  due  to  heroin  intoxication  during  the 
stabilization phase of CN138010.  
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  lower  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (7.8%)  than  the  placebo  group  (13.3%) 
during  the  maintenance  phase,  with  most  events  reported  in  the  system  organ  class  of  psychiatric 
disorders.  
The  incidence  of  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  was  also  lower  in  the  aripiprazole  group  (10.4%) 
than  the  placebo  group  (19.3%),  with  mania  the  most  frequently  reported  event  leading  to 
discontinuation in both groups. 
4. Six-Week Combination Therapy Study 
No deaths were reported in the 6-week placebo-controlled phase of CN138134, and the incidence of 
SAEs was low (aripiprazole 3.2%, placebo 2.3%).  
More  aripiprazole-treated  (11.9%)  than  placebo-treated  (6.2%)  patients  discontinued  from  study 
therapy because of an AE, with most of this treatment difference accounted for by the higher incidence 
in  the  aripiprazole  group  of  akathisia  (aripiprazole  5.1%,  placebo  0.8%)  and  tremor  (aripiprazole 
2.0%, placebo 0.8%).  
Laboratory findings 
In the 3-week placebo-controlled comparisons, 4 patients discontinued aripiprazole treatment because 
of events of syncope, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and heart rate increased. 
In  the  maintenance  treatment  study,  no  aripiprazole-treated  patient  discontinued  the  maintenance 
phase because of a laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality; 1 aripiprazole-treated patient 
discontinued study therapy due to mild hypertension. 
In  the  six-week  combination  therapy  study,  One  aripiprazole-treated  patient  discontinued  study 
therapy  because  of  increased  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK);  no  aripiprazole-treated  patients 
discontinued because of vital sign or ECG abnormalities.

Discussion on clinical safety 
in 
The  safety  profile  of  aripiprazole 
the  bipolar  mania  clinical  program  was  described 
comprehensively.  The  MAH  also  performed  an  analysis  using  all  aripiprazole  safety  database  to 
compare  the  profile  across  the  reported  indications,  more  particularly  between  schizophrenia  and 
bipolar  mania.  Furthermore  EPS,  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  (NMS),  seizures,  orthostatic 
hypotension  and  related  AEs,  suicide-related  AEs,  metabolic  abnormalities  AEs  were  specifically 
reviewed.  
Among all aripiprazole-treated patients in bipolar mania studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent 
AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  was  17.6%.  The  incidences  of  discontinuation  of 
aripiprazole  treatment  due  to  depression,  mania,  and  akathisia  were  higher  for  patients  with  bipolar 
mania than those reported for patients with schizophrenia.  
The  incidence  of  akathisia  was  higher  for  patients  with  bipolar  mania  (16.3%)  than  patients  with 
schizophrenia (7.3%).  
Among  aripiprazole-treated  patients  in  the  acute  bipolar  mania  studies,  the  incidence  of  clinically 
relevant  weight  gain  increased  over  time,  regardless  of  whether  aripiprazole  was  given  as 
monotherapy or given in combination with mood stabilizers . Furthermore, the mean percent changes 
from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  body  weight,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  and  waist  circumference  also 
increased  through  Week  26  and  beyond.    However,  among  all  aripiprazole-treated  patients  in  Phase 
2/3/4 studies, the incidence of clinically relevant weight increase for patients with acute bipolar mania 
was lower than for patients with schizophrenia or overall.  
Of the 1663 patients with bipolar mania who began aripiprazole treatment with a normal baseline CPK 
level,  43  (2.6%)  had  a  potentially  clinically  relevant  elevated  CPK  level  during  the  study.  The 
incidence was lower than seen with the schizophrenia indication and slightly higher than seen in other 
indications.  Of  the  43  events,  13  reported  concurrent  SAEs  (1  convulsion,  1  neuroleptic  malignant 
syndrome, 1 [non-cardiac] chest pain, 1 hypomania and loss of consciousness, 1 pancreatitis, 2 bipolar 
disorder exacerbated and 7 mania aggravated or exacerbated). 
The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  SAEs  for  patients  with  acute  bipolar  mania  was  lower 
than that reported for patients with schizophrenia (8.8% and 17.7%, respectively).  
The incidence of QTc with an increase of  ≥ 30 msec was 7.9% for patients with bipolar mania was 
lower than that reported for schizophrenia (14.8%) or overall (12.3%).  
In  overall,  although  there  were  some  differences  identified  in  the  frequencies  of  the  most  common 
AEs  as  compared  with  the  schizophrenia  population,  the  safety  profile  of  aripiprazole  appeared  to 
remain unchanged and no new safety concerns were raised in the bipolar mania clinical program. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP raised some concerns related to the occurrence of depression as treatment-
emergent AEs that led to discontinuation from study therapy which was observed more frequently in 
patients with bipolar-mania than in patients with schizophrenia (respectively, 2.7% versus 0.3%).The 
CHMP therefore recommended to reflect this information into the SPC.  
1.4  Pharmacovigilance

1.5  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk assessment 
Acute  efficacy  of  manic  episodes  was  demonstrated  in  4  short-term  monotherapy  trials,  2  of  which 
showed  maintenance  of  effect  similar  to  lithium  or  haloperidol  up  to  12  weeks,  and  1  adjunctive 
therapy  trial  with  lithium  or  valproate  demonstrated  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  aripiprazole  in 
combination  with  mood  stabilizers.  The  majority  of  these  trials  included  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe manic episodes, some of whom also had psychotic symptoms.  
The  supportive  study  for  the  recurrence  prevention  (CN138010)  used  “time  to  relapse”  as  primary 
outcome  measure.  However,  the  result  was  only  driven  by  effects  on  the  recurrence  of  new  manic 
episodes,  no  effect  was  seen  on  recurrence  prevention  of  new  depressive  episodes  based  on  the  key 
secondary  endpoints.  Nevertheless,  taking  into  account  the  first  6  months  and  the  74  weeks  double 
blind data, the CHMP was of the opinion that the proposed indication could be acceptable, provided 
that the target population is further defined. The CHMP recommended the following wording: 
‘Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I disorder and 
for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes 
and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).’’ 
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  recommended  to  reflect  the  negative  results  concerning  the  prevention  of 
depressive episodes into section 5.1 of the SPC. 
The  MAH  also  committed  to  further  investigate  in  clinical  trials  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  in 
combination  with  mood  stabilizers  (lithium  and  valproate)  or  lamotrigine  in  the  prevention  of 
recurrence in patients with Bipolar I Disorder. 
With regards to safety, aripiprazole was safe and well-tolerated in the bipolar mania clinical program. 
The  adverse  effects  of  aripiprazole  were  generally  mild  to  moderate  and  similar  to  those  previously 
observed  in  the  schizophrenia  population  treated  with  aripiprazole.  No  unexpected  safety  concerns 
were identified. 
Importantly,  the  adverse  effect  profile  of  aripiprazole  was  different  from  that  of  other  atypical 
antipsychotic  drugs  that  are  commonly  used  to  treat  mania.  Aripiprazole  did  not  show  any  safety 
concerns on QT prolongation, hyperprolactinemia, or weight gain. EPS was more frequently reported 
in  aripiprazole-treated  than  in  placebo-treated  patients,  but  at  a  rate  of  approximately  half  that  of 
haloperidol-treated patients. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP raised some concerns on the occurrence of depression as treatment-emergent 
AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  from  study  therapy  and  therefore  recommended  to  reflect  this 
information into the SPC.  
Overall, the CHMP considered the benefit risk assessment of Abilify ‘in the treatment of moderate to 
severe manic episodes in Bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients 
who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole 
treatment’  positive and recommended the variation to the Marketing Authorisation.

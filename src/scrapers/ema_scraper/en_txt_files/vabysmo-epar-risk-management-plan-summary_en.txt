Information
Indication(s) in the EEA 
Chemical class:  Faricimab is a humanised bispecific 
IgG1 antibody.
Summary of mode of action:  Faricimab acts through 
inhibition of two distinct pathways by neutralisation of 
both Ang-2 and VEGF-A.
Ang-2 causes vascular instability by promoting 
endothelial destabilisation, pericyte loss, and 
pathological angiogenesis, thus potentiating vascular 
leakage and inflammation.  It also sensitizes blood 
vessels to the activity of VEGF-A resulting in further 
vascular destabilisation. Ang-2 and VEGF-A 
synergistically increase vascular permeability and 
stimulate neovascularisation. 
By dual inhibition of Ang-2 and VEGF-A, faricimab 
reduces vascular permeability and inflammation, 
inhibits pathological angiogenesis and restores 
vascular stability.
Important information about its composition:  
Faricimab is a humanised antibody produced in 
mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cell culture by 
recombinant DNA technology.

Dosage in the EEA 
Current:   
The medicinal product must be administered by a 
qualified physician experienced in intravitreal 
injections.  Each vial should only be used for the 
treatment of a single eye.
nAMD
The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 mL solution) 
administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks 
(monthly) for the first 4 doses.
Thereafter, an assessment of disease activity based 
on anatomic and/or visual outcomes is recommended 
20 and/or 24 weeks after treatment initiation so that 
treatment can be individualised.  In patients without 
disease activity, administration of faricimab every 16 
weeks (4 months) should be considered. In patients 
with disease activity, treatment every 8 weeks (2 
months) or 12 weeks (3 months) should be 
considered. There is limited safety data on treatment 
intervals of 8 weeks or less between injections.
Monitoring between the dosing visits should be 
scheduled based on the patient's status and at the 
physician's discretion, but there is no requirement for 
monthly monitoring between injections.
DME
The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 mL solution) 
administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks 
(monthly) for the first 4 doses. 
Thereafter, treatment is individualised using a treat-
and-extend approach.  Based on the physician's 
judgement of the individual patient’s anatomic and/or 
visual outcomes, the dosing interval may be extended 
up to every 16 weeks (4 months), in increments of up 
to 4 weeks.  If anatomic and/or visual outcomes 
change, the treatment interval should be adjusted 
accordingly, and interval reduction should be 
implemented if anatomic and/or visual outcomes 
deteriorate. Treatment intervals shorter than 4 weeks 
between injections have not been studied.
Monitoring between the dosing visits should be 
scheduled based on the patient's status and at the 
physician's discretion, but there is no requirement for 
monthly monitoring between injections.

SI.1 Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration
 Incidence
Incidence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in Europe, the 
United States (US), Australia, and Asia are reported in Table 2.
In most studies, patients were older adults (aged 50 years and older).  Cumulative 
incidence ranged from 0.4% over a mean of 6.5 years in Portugal (patients aged 
55 years and older) to 9.8% over 14 years in Denmark (patients 6080 years old) (Buch 
et al. 2005; Farinha et al. 2019a).  
In the US, a study with a follow up of 10 years estimated an incidence of 2.6% (in 
patients with mean age 69±9 years) (Klein et al. 2013).

 Prevalence
In a systematic review of 22 studies published since 1996 in Europe, the overall pooled 
prevalence of nAMD was 1.4% in patients aged 6081 years (Li et al. 2020a).  The 
overall prevalence of nAMD in the US population 40 years and older in a pooled analysis 
of three studies was estimated to be 1.02% (Friedman et al. 2004).  The prevalence did 
not differ statistically between the US and Europe (Smith et al. 2001).  The prevalence of 
nAMD was found to increase with age (Table 3; Rudnicka et al. 2012).
A cross-sectional meta-analysis of 22 Asian studies comprising of 97,213 individuals 
aged 40 years and above reported a pooled prevalence of 0.5% for nAMD (Hyungtaek et 
al. 2020).  A population based cross-sectional survey in Australia on 4,836 individuals 
aged 40 years and above reported the prevalence of nAMD as 0.24% in 3,098 non-
indigenous Australian adults, with no cases of nAMD reported in 1,738 indigenous 
Australian adults. (Keel et al. 2017).
Additional recently published studies are summarized in Table 3.

 Demographics
Age:  The prevalence and incidence of nAMD increases with age.  According to a 
meta-analysis of 22 studies in Europe, the pooled prevalence of nAMD was 0.1% among 
people aged 64 years, 0.8% among people aged 6574 years, and 3.3% among 
people aged 75 years (Table 3, Li et al. 2020a).  This trend of increasing prevalence 
with age was reported in studies conducted in Australia, the UK, and Taiwan (Owen et 
al. 2012; Keel et al. 2017; Hu et al. 2017).  A pooled analysis from three countries (US, 
The Netherlands and Australia) reported significantly higher risk in patients aged 
8086 years and 7079 years compared to patients aged 5069 years (Table 4; Smith 
et al. 2001).
Gender:  The risk of nAMD in men and women was found to be contrasting.  In a study 
from Europe, a higher incidence of nAMD was observed among females (2.3 per 
1000 person-years [PY]) compared to men (1.3 per 1000 PY) (Rudnicka et al. 2015).  
Studies from Asia (China and South Korea) reported increased risk of nAMD among 
men compared to women (Song et al. 2017; Rim et al. 2018).
In a retrospective, multicenter, non-interventional real-world evidence study in the US
that included 79,885 patients with nAMD, the mean age was 82.6±8.4 years and 63% of 
the nAMD population was female (Khanani et al. 2020).  Based on studies from Europe 
and the US, for all age groups (50 years and older), women were found to have a higher 
prevalence of nAMD than men (Owen et al. 2012; Rudnicka et al. 2012).  Asian 
population tends to demonstrate a reversed trend with a slightly greater predilection 
towards male gender (e.g., 59.6% males reported by Hu et al. 2017 and 56.6% reported 
by Rim et al. 2018).
Racial disparity:  A prospective cohort study examined the 8-year overall incidence of 
late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (including nAMD and geographic atrophy) 
in four major racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese) living in six U.S.
communities.  The study reported that incidence of late AMD was highest in Whites 
(4.1%), intermediate in Chinese (2.2%), followed by Hispanics (0.8%), and lowest in 
Blacks (0.4%) (Fisher et al. 2016).
 The main existing treatment options
Prior to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, laser photocoagulation 
therapy and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin were the standard of care based on 
their ability to stabilize vision.  Although these treatments remain a therapeutic option for 
selected patients, the current standard of care in nAMD is intravitreal injections of 
anti-VEGF agents as first-line treatment, including ranibizumab (Lucentis, Accentrix), 
aflibercept (Eylea), and brolucizumab (Beovu).  Additionally, bevacizumab 
(Avastin) is unlicensed for ocular use yet broadly used in clinical practice worldwide.

The benefit of anti-VEGF therapies and their ability to restore vision has been widely 
recognized since the first approval of ranibizumab in 2006 (AAO 2019).  A key challenge 
with currently available anti-VEGF treatments is the requirement for frequent and 
long-term administration to maintain vision gains (Heier et al. 2012;  Maguire et al.
2016).  Patients can be treated with anti-VEGF injections as often as monthly for nAMD 
control.  Treatment intervals longer than the prescribed regimens are possible for some 
patients; however, frequent eye examinations and office visits are still required to 
achieve the patient’s best visual outcomes.  Real-world data suggest that many patients 
with nAMD do not receive treatment at the optimal frequency, and this under-treatment 
in clinical practice is associated with lower visual acuity gains compared with those 
observed in controlled clinical trials (Cohen et al. 2013; Finger et al. 2013; Holz et al. 
2015; Rao et al. 2018).

 Natural history of the indicated condition in the (untreated) population:
Some patients develop both advanced stages of AMD: nAMD and geographic atrophy.  
Untreated nAMD eventually leads to irreversible vision loss and blindness, and it is the 
most debilitating form of AMD (Ghoshal et al. 2018).
A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of publications from 1980 to 2005 
identified 4,362 untreated nAMD patients.  The proportion of patients who developed 
severe vision loss (6 lines) from baseline increased from 21.3% at 6 months to 41.9% 
by 3 years.  The proportion of patients with visual acuity worse than logarithm of the 
Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) 1.0 (20/200 Snellen) increased from 19.7% at 
baseline to 75.7% by 3 years.  nAMD developed in the fellow eye in 12.2% of patients by 
12 months and in 26.8% by 4 years (Wong et al. 2008).
A major subtype of nAMD in the Asian population is polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, 
which affects up to 50% of Asians with nAMD and tends to present in younger patients 
sometimes acutely with massive subretinal hemorrhage and severe vision loss (Fenwick 
et al. 2017).
The development of nAMD typically manifests in one eye.  The presence of nAMD in 
one eye is a major risk factor for the development of nAMD in the fellow eye (Wong et al. 
2020).  The symptoms of nAMD are metamorphopsia, scotoma, and blurriness in the 
central vision, which negatively affect patient mobility, face recognition, reading, driving, 
and other daily activities, including self-care (Mitchell et al. 2018).  An observational 
study using National Health Insurance Research Database from Taiwan showed a 
significantly higher risk of stroke in patients with prior nAMD history than for patients 
without any type of AMD.  Prior nAMD history was also related to a higher incidence of 
hemorrhagic stroke but not ischemic stroke (Lee et al. 2017).

A meta-analysis of nine studies estimated that late AMD was associated with a 20% 
increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to the patients without AMD.  There was 
evidence of a 46% increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality for those with late 
AMD compared to those without AMD (McGuinness et al. 2017).  Decreased visual 
acuity is associated with increased five-year mortality and even relatively mild visual 
impairment increases the risk of death more than two-fold (McCarty et al. 2001).
Findings from long-term follow-up studies regarding a possible association of nAMD with 
increased mortality risk have been inconsistent.  Results from some studies have 
observed no association between nAMD and mortality (Borger et al. 2003; Pedula et al. 
2015); however, nAMD was reported as a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in 
women in a population-based 14-year cohort study in people aged 6080 years in 
Denmark (Buch et al. 2005) and in men in a 15-year cohort study in Australia (Gopinath 
et al. 2016).  In a cohort study in Iceland, nAMD was associated with all-cause mortality 
only in the subgroup aged 83 years or older (Fisher et al. 2015), while in the Blue 
Mountains Eye Study, nAMD was significantly associated with all-cause mortality only 
among persons younger than 75 years (Cugati et al. 2007).  Age-Related Eye Disease 
Study 2, a randomized, double-masked, controlled trial, reported that participants with 
nAMD in one eye at baseline had a statistically significant increased risk for mortality 
compared with participants with no or few drusen.  Visual impairment could be 
associated with depression, which has been linked with poor quality of life and 
decreased life span (Papudesu et al. 2018).
Given that the prevalence and incidence of nAMD increases with age, and the disease is
most prevalent in patients  65 years of age (Table 3, Li et al. 2020a), there is a low 
likelihood that female patients on treatment for nAMD will be of child-bearing age.

SI.2 Diabetic Macular Edema
 Incidence
Recently published population-based studies that have provided incidence figures for 
DME and the clinically significant macular edema (CSME) form of DME are listed in 
Table 6.  The results are grouped by diabetes subtype: type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or any diabetes (mixed population of T1DM and 
T2DM).
The reported cumulative incidence of DME depended mainly on the length of follow-up 
of the patients in the different studies and the type of diabetes (Klein et al. 2009;
Romero-Aroca et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2012).  The highest rates of DME among 
diabetics are provided by the studies in T1DM populations with very long follow-up times 
(e.g., 29% in a study with 25-year follow-up) (Klein et al. 2009).  It is worth noting that, in 
the included studies, the follow-up period for T1DM is longer than T2DM because T1DM 
starts at a young age and the disease has more time to progress.  Patients typically 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.3 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
faricimab
23
of
128
develop T2DM later in life; therefore, the disease has less time to progress.  T2DM DME 
patients often are less compliant with their glycaemia management (i.e., difficult to 
maintain hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] levels) and often develop DME (Wong et al. 2006).
The global increase of DME is driven by the DME in T2DM because there are many 
more patients with T2DM compared to T1DM (Table 6).  When separated based on the 
type of diabetes, the cumulative incidence of DME ranged from 8.5% to 29% in patients 
with T1DM (follow-up: 925 years), 1.5% to 9.2% in patients with T2DM (follow-up: 
5.710 years), and 0.8% to 5.4% in patients with any diabetes (follow-up: 48 years) 
(Table 6).
The Wisconsin Epidemiologic study on diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the US stated that 
over a 25-year study period, of the 515,000 to 1.3 million Americans with T1DM, 
approximately 149,000 to 377,000 (~29%) will develop DME and 88,000 to 221,000 
(~17%) will develop CSME (Klein et al. 2009).

a DME was defined as retinal thickening in the macular area.  CSME was defined as the presence of retinal thickening at or within 500 μm of the 
center of the macula or hard exudates at or within 500 μm of the center of the macula if associated with thickening of the adjacent retina or 
zones of retinal thickening 1 disc area in size, at least part of which was within 1 disc diameter of the center.
b A regression model accounting for competing risk of death was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of CSME over 30 years of diabetes. 
The mean duration of diabetes of the sample was 24.6 years.

 Prevalence
Several population-based studies have provided prevalence figures for DME and CSME.  
Selected studies are summarized in Table 7, by diabetes subtype.
A pooled analysis of 35 studies including over 20,000 diabetics from Europe, the US, 
Australia, and Asia estimated a global prevalence of 6.81% for DME (Yau et al. 2012).  
By extrapolating prevalence to the 2010 world diabetes population, it was estimated that
20.6 million people are living with DME (Yau et al. 2012).  Similar to the incidence data, 
the prevalence was also reported to be higher in patients with T1DM as compared to 
T2DM and any diabetes.  Also, studies with patients having longer disease duration 
reported a higher prevalence of DME (Yau et al. 2012; Li et al. 2020b).  The prevalence 
of DME (any level or definition) in studies assessing information directly from fundus 
photographs was estimated to range from 5.4% to 14.25% in T1DM patients, 0.18% to 
5.57% in T2DM, and 2.3% to 7.05% in studies with mixed diabetes population (Table 7).  
The differences are attributed to different underlying populations in terms of disease 
etiology and duration or ethnic makeup.
A pooled analysis of 35 European studies reported an overall prevalence of 3.7% in 
diabetic patients aged 40 years (Li et al. 2020b).  In Europe, the highest prevalence 
was reported to be in the United Kingdom, while the lowest was recorded in France.  
Studies from the US estimated a DME prevalence of 2.3% to 6.0% in diabetic patients 
(Bressler et al. 2014; Varma et al. 2014; Bursell et al. 2018), comparatively lower than 
the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study from the US in which the 
prevalence of DME and CSME was reported to be 9.0% and 5.6%, respectively (Wong 
et al. 2006).  The difference may be due to the racial/ethnic composition of the 
participants included in the MESA study, in which non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics 
comprised the majority of the study sample.

 Demographics
Duration of disease: The key factor in the development of DME is diabetes duration, 
irrespective of disease type (Yau et al. 2012).  A pooled analysis reported that the 
prevalence of DME was 3.1% in patients with <10-year diabetes duration, 13.4% in 
10<20 years diabetes duration, and 20% in patients with ≥20 years of diabetes duration 
(Yau et al. 2012).  A study in the US estimated that 70% of DME patients had a duration 
of diabetes of 10 years or more (Varma et al. 2014).  
Age: The average age of patients depends on the diabetes type, with a mean age of 
T2DM patients with DME of about 6070 years (Hietala et al. 2013; Matuszewski et al. 
2020), and a mean age of T1DM patients with DME of about 3750 years (Hsieh et al. 
2018; Matuszewski et al. 2020).
Gender: The prevalence was estimated to be similar in men (7.44%) and women 
(7.54%) from a pooled analysis of 32 studies globally (Yau et al. 2012).
Racial disparity: Based on ethnicities, a higher prevalence was reported in African 
patients followed by Caucasian and Chinese and lowest in South Asian patients with 
diabetes (Yau et al 2012).  A study from the US reported the prevalence of 3.8% for 
DME and also reported the highest prevalence among African Americans (8.4%), 
followed by Hispanics (5.1%), and non-Hispanic Whites (2.6%) (Varma et al. 2014).  A 
retrospective data analysis study of American Indians and Alaska Natives with diabetes 
reported the prevalence of 2.3% for DME (Bursell et al. 2018).
Geographical distribution: A pooled analysis of 35 European studies reported an 
overall prevalence of 3.7% in diabetic patients aged 40 years (Li et al. 2020b).  The 
prevalence of DME and CSME in the US in overall T1DM and T2DM patients was 4.31% 
and 0.23%, respectively (Thomas et al. 2019).  Based on geographical distribution, the 
prevalence of DME (T1DM and T2DM) was estimated to be highest in African regions 
(21.5%).  The prevalence of DME in persons with T1DM in Europe and Africa was 8.8% 
and 13.5%, respectively.  Regarding T2DM, the prevalence of DME was much higher in 
Africa and Western Pacific at 41.0% and 19.1%, respectively (Thomas et al. 2019).
 The main existing treatment options
Focal macular laser used to be first-line therapy in the treatment of DME, but the 
development of anti-VEGF biologics in the last 10 years has led to dramatic 
improvements in visual outcomes for patients with DME (Elman et al. 2010).  Currently 
available approved anti-VEGF therapies for DME include ranibizumab (Lucentis, 
Accentrix), aflibercept (Eylea), and brolucizumab (Beovu).  All three therapies are 
approved for patients with visual impairment due to DME in the EU, while ranibizumab 
(Lucentis®) and aflibercept (Eylea®) are both approved for the treatment of patients with 
DME in the US.  Despite the significant improvements in both vision and anatomical 
outcomes achieved with anti-VEGF injections in DME, the current standard-of-care for 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.3 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
faricimab
30
of
128
management requires patients to undergo frequent clinical examinations and intravitreal 
injections.  This imposes a significant burden on patients, caregivers, treating 
physicians, and the healthcare system; thus, the average number of injections received 
and the consequent improvements in vision are lower in the real-world setting than in 
clinical trials (Fong et al. 2018; Hodzic-Hadzibegovic et al. 2018; Stefanickova et al. 
2018; Ziemssen et al. 2018; Farinha et al. 2019b).
Other available approved options for the treatment of DME include periocular or 
intravitreal steroids and steroid implants.  In particular, long-acting steroid implants have 
become popular for use in patients who are not able to come back for frequent visits and 
have a strong inflammatory component of the disease.  In non-responders who have 
already been treated with anti-VEGFs (after 36 injections, depending on the specific 
response of each patient), switching to another anti-VEGF agent or, in specific cases, 
steroids may be recommended.  However, steroids are associated with increased and 
earlier risk of cataract, glaucoma, secondary infection, and delay in wound healing (AAO 
2013).
 Risk factors for the disease
A study in the United Kingdom reported that DME risk increased with high alcohol use, 
cataracts, HbA1c 7%, systolic blood pressure 160mm Hg, total cholesterol 5mmol/L, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 3mmol/L, and microalbuminuria (Martin-Merino et al. 
2017).  A study in Turkey reported that duration of diabetes, use of antihypertensives, 
higher level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol consumption, nephropathy, 
neuropathy, previous cataract surgery, severity of DR, and insulin usage were 
statistically significantly associated with DME (Acan et al. 2018).
A study from the US on 447,407 patients with diabetes reported that African-Americans 
and Latinos had an increased hazard of developing DME compared to Caucasians.  
Other risk factors identified in the study were diabetic neuropathy or diabetic 
nephropathy, uncomplicated hypertension, end-organ damage caused by hypertension, 
and increases in the baseline value of HbA1c lab tests (Talwar et al. 2013).
 Natural history of the indicated condition in the (untreated) population:
DME is an advanced manifestation of DR and the major cause of central vision loss 
among patients with DR (Leasher et al. 2016; Yoon et al. 2019).  If left untreated, DME 
can lead to a loss of 10 or more letters in visual acuity within 2 years in approximately 
50% of patients (Ciulla et al. 2003).  It can develop at any stage of the underlying 
disease of retinal microvasculature (Fong et al. 2004).  This disease contributes to 
central vision loss, limiting the ability to perform tasks essential for daily life and 
maintaining self-sufficiency, and is associated with increased social isolation and 
decreased mental health in this patient population comprised primarily of working-age 
adults (Hariprasad et al. 2008).

A retrospective study showed that over a period of 14 months, 48 of the 153 eyes (31%) 
with subclinical DME progressed to CSME that, in the opinion of the treating clinicians, 
required treatment (Browning and Fraser 2008).  In a Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical 
Research Network study (Protocol G), the probability of an eye developing a significantly 
increased central subfield thickness, or judged by clinicians to warrant treatment for 
DME by 1 year and by 2 years, were 27% and 38%, respectively (Bressler et al. 2012).
In one European study, 5 out of 48 eyes (10%) with baseline subclinical DME developed 
clinical macular edema after 12 months (Tejerina et al. 2015).  Another European study 
reported that 6 out of 32 eyes (19%) with subclinical DME at baseline progressed to 
CSME over the course of 24 months, while only 20 out of 316 eyes (6%) without 
subclinical DME at baseline progressed to CSME, suggesting that subclinical DME is 
likely to progress to CSME if left untreated (Pires et al. 2013).
A meta-analysis of six studies found a linear relation between visual acuity and the risk 
of mortality (Zhang et al. 2016).  For every 0.1 logMAR increment, the risk of mortality 
increased by 4%.  When the analysis was restricted to the studies that were conducted 
in the following four continents, the risk of mortality increased by: 29% in North America, 
44% in Oceania, 80% in Asia, and 22% in Europe in patients with visual impairment 
(Zhang et al. 2016).
A study reported hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, ischemic heart disease, and stroke 
death for those with CSME and T1DM or T2DM (Hirai et al. 2008).  Results were 
adjusted for age, gender, diabetes mellitus duration, body mass index, HbA1c, history of 
CV disease, nephropathy, hypertension, and smoking status.  In the fully adjusted 
models when comparing to those without CSME, mortality appeared to be increased for 
T2DM patients with CSME, especially among those treated with insulin.  In contrast, 
T1DM patients with CSME did not appear to be at an increased risk of death compared 
to T1DM without CSME (Hirai et al. 2008).
Limited information is available for prevalence of pregnancy in the DME population. 
Prevalence estimates for presence of DME at any time during pregnancy range from 5% 
to 27% in T1DM and 4% in T2DM (Morrison et al. 2016). DME may develop or worsen 
during pregnancy and is generally observed in pregnant patients with proteinuria or 
hypertension (Yenerel and Küçümen. 2015).  In a prospective study of 102 pregnant 
women with T1DM (median T1DM duration: 16 years), 10 participants with macular 
edema had no progression in pregnancy while 2 participants had mild-moderate 
progression and 4 participants had sight-threatening progression (Vestgaard et al.
2010).  In a Danish study that included 121 pregnant women with T1DM for more than 
1 year, DME was present in 12 participants with progression occurring in 4 of the 
participants (Ringholm et al. 2011).  DME occurring during pregnancy is likely to resolve 
spontaneously in the post-partum period.  Women with DME undergoing treatment with 
anti-VEGF medications are advised to use active contraception during treatment. Anti-
VEGF medications should only be administered during pregnancy if the potential benefit

justifies the risk to the fetus and women should be appropriately informed of the risk
(Morrison et al. 2016).

PART II:  MODULE SII NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY
SPECIFICATION
Key safety findings from nonclinical studies and relevance to human usage:  
Repeat-dose toxicity:
In the 2-month and 6-month Good Laboratory Practice studies in cynomolgus monkeys 
(Report 1053361, Report 1057630), dose dependent ocular inflammatory cell infiltration 
and clinical signs of ocular inflammation occurred in faricimab-treated eyes following 
intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (Q4W), starting from the mid doses of 3- or 
1.5-mg/eye/dose up to the high doses of 6- and 3-mg/eye/dose, respectively.  Ocular 
findings in the 2- and 6-month studies generally correlated with the systemic presence of 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and exposure loss in the serum of all animals with ocular 
inflammation until the end of the treatment period.  Subsequent immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) evaluations confirmed these findings to be consistent with an immune-mediated 
response (and subsequent complement activation) to a humanized antibody such as 
faricimab in non-human primates, as previously shown in rabbits (Meyer 1987).
No clinical ocular findings were observed in recovery animals after a 4- or 13-week 
treatment-free recovery period in the 2- and 6-month studies, respectively.  
Histopathological ocular findings of inflammatory cell infiltration seen in recovery animals 
were considered to represent partial reversal of the inflammatory cell infiltration seen at

the terminal sacrifice in other animals.  There were no relevant findings in the untreated 
eyes receiving vehicle injections Q4W up to 6 months of treatment.
At the end of the 4-week recovery period in the 2-month study, faricimab-related minimal 
mixed cell inflammation was present in the aortic root in one male from each of the 
6 mg/eye/dose intravitreal injection and 5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) dose groups.  IHC 
evaluations also confirmed these findings to be consistent with an immune-mediated 
response (and subsequent complement activation) in monkeys.  No extra-ocular findings 
were observed in the 6-month study in monkeys (Report 1057630).
Relevance to human use:
The observed inflammatory response in the eye and at the aortic root is attributed to an 
immune-mediated response against the humanized full-length immunoglobulin G1
(IgG1) antibody faricimab in cynomolgus monkeys.  Therefore, limited clinical relevance 
is attributed to these findings in terms of predicting the potential immunogenicity/ADA 
formation against faricimab in humans.  This assessment is further supported by the 
development experience with the anti-VEGF antibody fragment ranibizumab.  Although 
the repeat-dose intravitreal injection ocular toxicity studies in monkeys with ranibizumab 
resulted in ADA-related intraocular inflammation (IOI), the clinical safety and ADA data 
from the Phase I, II, and III studies across multiple disease indications showed no clear 
correlation between serum antibodies and ocular inflammation or decrease in visual 
acuity (Lucentis SmPC).  These findings further support that immunogenicity in 
nonclinical species is caused by xenoantigens (i.e., immune reactions not occurring in 
the autologous species) and is of limited value as a predictor of immunogenicity in 
humans (van Meer et al. 2013).
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with faricimab.  
ADAs are indicators of an immune response to the administered therapeutic protein, 
which for intravitreal injection drugs could potentially result in IOI.  Incidence of ADA 
induction/boosting across all Phase II studies was approximately 10%, consistent with 
Phase II studies, incidence of ADA induction/boosting across all Phase III studies was 
also approximately 10% (nAMD: 10.4% and DME: 9.6%) (Annex 7C.1, Annex 7C.2).  
Overall, the incidence rate of IOI was low and not more than 2% in nAMD and DME 
Phase III studies (Annex 7C.15 and Annex 7C.17, respectively).  Based on all available 
data to date, no meaningful impact of ADA was observed on efficacy, 
pharmacodynamics, and on overall safety. Although a higher incidence of IOI was 
observed in ADA-positive patients (nAMD: 5/75 [6.7%], Annex 7C.3 and Annex 7C.4; 
DME: 15/128 [11.7%], Annex 7C.5 and Annex 7C.6) compared with ADA-negative 
patients (nAMD: 7/582 [1.2%], Annex 7C.7 and Annex 7C.8; DME: 5/1124 [0.4%], Annex 
7C.9 and Annex 7C.10), this observation is not currently considered to be clinically 
relevant. Based on the low incidence of immunogenicity, the low incidence of IOI for 
which the majority of the events were of mild to moderate severity and had a reversible

character, patients receiving faricimab in clinical trials will continue to be monitored for
signs and symptoms that might be suggestive of immunogenicity.
Reproductive/developmental toxicity:
The 2- and 6-month studies in cynomolgus monkeys did not reveal any effects of 
faricimab on fertility, reproductive organs, or the course and outcome of pregnancy or 
fetal viability (Report 1053361; Report 1057630).  In the 6-month monkey toxicology 
study, systemic exposures at the highest dose were 810-fold greater than faricimab 
human steady-state systemic exposure estimates in nAMD and DME patients,
respectively.  In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys 
there were no effects of faricimab on the course and outcome of pregnancy or fetal 
viability following 5 weekly IV injections at up to 3 mg/kg (Report 1093222).  Serum 
exposure (maximum serum concentration [Cmax]) at the no-observed-adverse-effect-level 
(NOAEL) dose of 3 mg/kg was more than 500-fold greater than faricimab human steady-
state systemic exposure estimates in nAMD and DME patients.
Relevance to human use:
VEGF is a major angiogenic factor involved in the formation of new blood vessels during 
embryonic and fetal development and placentation.  VEGF inhibition has been shown to 
affect follicular development, corpus luteum function, and fertility.  The pharmacological 
inhibition of angiogenesis by faricimab is generally expected to have adverse 
consequences on the female reproductive cycle, since angiogenesis plays a critical role 
in ovarian and endometrial function (Klauber et al. 1997).  In general, all anti-angiogenic 
agents are expected to be teratogenic or otherwise harmful for the fetus and are thus not 
recommended for use during pregnancy (Lambertini et al. 2015; Lucentis E.U. SmPC;
Avastin E.U. SmPC).
Angiopoietin (ANG)-2 is expressed at sites of vascular remodeling in the embryo and 
placenta (Seval et al. 2008).  Knockout mice deficient in ANG-2 die at birth due to vessel 
defects as Ang-2 is required for postnatal angiogenesis and lymphatic patterning, and 
only the latter role is rescued by ANG-1 (Gale et al. 2002).  As with VEGF, inhibition of 
ANG-2 is expected to cause impairment in embryofetal development, if systemic 
exposure and transplacental uptake is sufficient.  In the eye, ANG-2 depletion caused 
pericyte dropout in the normal retina (Hammes et al. 2004).  There are currently no 
marketed biotherapeutics inhibiting ANG-2.
In patients, the systemic exposure to faricimab following unilateral intravitreal 
administrations of 6 mg faricimab is low, with a mean Cmax of 0.2 g/mL appearing 
approximately 2 days post-dose and mean trough concentration (Ctrough) of 0.003 g/mL, 
for every 8 weeks (Q8W) dosing without accumulation after multiple administrations.
In 
line with the low systemic exposure, no suppression from baseline in VEGF-A or Ang-2 
was observed in plasma of patients dosed with faricimab in the Phase III studies 
(Population PK Report, Report 1105763).

faricimab

Furthermore, in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, faricimab at serum exposure (Cmax) 
more than 500-times greater than the faricimab human steady-state systemic exposure 
estimates there were no developmental toxicity, teratogenicity, or effect on weight or 
structure of the placenta observed.  However, because of the anti-angiogenic 
mechanism of action, faricimab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and 
embryo-/fetotoxic, and as a precautionary measure it is preferable to avoid use during 
pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
General safety pharmacology:
In compliance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) S6 (R1) guidance, 
safety pharmacological endpoints were integrated in the 2- and 6-month cynomolgus 
monkey studies (Report 1053361, Report 1057630).  Faricimab did not induce any 
neurological findings up to 6 months of treatment.  Heart rate and electrocardiogram
endpoints, including QT and QTc, were comparable between control and 
faricimab-dosed groups.  In addition, no notable findings were recorded for respiratory 
rate or body temperature measurements.
Relevance to human use:
In patients, the systemic exposure to faricimab via intravitreal injections is low.  No 
adverse effects on general safety pharmacology endpoints were observed in the 
nonclinical program up to the highest doses, achieving Cmax of about 10- up to more than 
700-fold greater than faricimab human steady-state systemic exposure estimates in 
nAMD and DME patients (based on human exposures from population pharmacokinetics
(popPK) model following 6 mg Q8W dosing).  Consistent with the absence of nonclinical 
effects on safety pharmacology endpoints, the incidence of non-ocular adverse events 
(AEs) in the faricimab arms was comparable to the ranibizumab and aflibercept arms 
across the clinical development program.  Faricimab was generally well tolerated by 
patients, with no systemic toxicities observed for any system organ class.
Other toxicity-related information or data:
No unspecific tissue binding of faricimab was observed in cross reactivity studies of 
normal human tissues (Report 1055832, Report 1056445).  The results from in vitro 
whole blood assays suggest that there is no substantial risk of cytokine release 
syndrome, direct complement activation, or peripheral immune-cell depletion with 
administration of faricimab (Report 1055400, Report 1059118).
Relevance to human use:
In line with nonclinical data, there was no evidence for cytokine release syndrome in the 
clinical development program.

PART II:  MODULE SIII CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
The exposure and safety data included in this RMP are derived from seven studies 
(Table 9).
Safety data pooling of Phase II studies (i.e., nAMD AVENUE + nAMD STAIRWAY + 
DME/DR BOULEVARD) and with Phase III studies (i.e., nAMD TENAYA/LUCERNE + 
DME/DR YOSEMITE/RHINE studies) is not appropriate because of notable differences 
in study design and treatment duration.  Examples of notable study design differences 
between the Phase II and Phase III include study duration, treatment dosage, choice of 
active comparator and treatment frequency. 
Exposure data is provided from the Phase III pivotal studies up to Week 48 for nAMD 
studies (i.e., the time point for primary analysis) and during the entire study (through 
Week 100) for DME studies. Exposure from the Phase II supportive studies is provided 
separately.

Duration of Exposure
The faricimab safety population provides data from 1926 patients with 2740 years 
person-time of exposure in the Phase III program.  This population consists of 
664 patients with nAMD (588 years person-time exposure) and 1262 patients with DME 
(2152 years person-time exposure).  The majority (92.8%) of nAMD patients received 
treatment for 9 to 12 months consistent with the primary analysis endpoint time. The 
majority (87.9%) of DME patients received treatment for 1.5 years, consistent with the 
Week 100 time-point (Table 10).
The Phase II program provides an additional 384 patients exposed to faricimab with 
194 years person-time (Annex 7A.1).  All Phase II patients had a duration of exposure 
less than 1 year (100.0% across both indications).
Number of Study Drug Administrations in the Study Eye
Overall, in the nAMD Phase III safety population (n=664) through Week 48, the median 
duration of exposure was 48.1 weeks with an average of 6.4 study drug administrations
(Annex 7A.2).  The maximum number of study drug administrations up to study Week 48 
in the nAMD faricimab Phase III safety population was eight, consistent with primary 
analysis endpoint time.  Of the total 664 nAMD faricimab patients, 112 patients (16.9%) 
received the maximum eight administrations (Table 11).  Most patients (89.3%, n=593) 
received six injections.
Overall, in the DME Phase III safety population (n=1262) during the entire study, the 
median duration of exposure was 96.1 weeks with an average of 12.7 study drug 
administrations (Annex 7A.3).  Of the total 1262 DME faricimab patients, 40.2% (n=507) 
received 15 or more study drug administrations, with <5% receiving 18 or more 
injections.  Twelve patients (1.0%) received the maximum 25 administrations (Table 11).  
The total number of faricimab injections was 20,229 across the Phase III program: 
4,239 injections in nAMD patients and 15,990 injections in DME patients (Annex 7A.4).
Most patients in the Phase II program received six injections (90.6%, n=348) 
(Annex 7A.5).  There were a total of 1,958 faricimab 6 mg injections and 696 faricimab 
1.5 mg injections across both indications (Annex 7A.6).
Exposure by Age Group and Gender
In the overall faricimab safety population from the Phase III program, 1045 patients were 
male, and 881 patients were female (Table 12).  Male patients had 1563 patient-years of 
exposure versus 1177 patient-years in female patients.  In the pooled population, the 
highest proportion of males were in the <65 years age group (48.8%), and the highest 
proportion of females in the 65 to <75 years age group (37.9%).
The majority of faricimab patients with nAMD were female, and the highest proportion of 
patients of each gender were in the 75 to <85 years age group (Table 12).  In the

faricimab DME group, the majority of patients were male, and the majority of patients of 
both genders were in the <65 years age group.
The Phase II program provides exposure from 233 female and 151 male patients, with 
the majority in the 75 to <85 years age group (Annex 7A.7).
Exposure by Faricimab Dose
In the Phase III studies, there were a total of 664 patients with nAMD (588 years 
person-time exposure) and 1262 patients with DME (2152 years person-time exposure), 
all receiving faricimab 6 mg (Annex 7A.8).
The Phase II program provides an additional 384 patients exposed to faricimab with 
194 years person-time.  The Phase II program included two doses of faricimab.  Most 
patients (73.7%, n=283) received 6 mg faricimab, and 26.3% (n=101) received 1.5 mg 
faricimab (Annex 7A.9).
Exposure by Race
In the overall safety population from the Phase III program, the majority (80.9%) of 
faricimab patients were White (1558 patients, 2199 patient-years of exposure), which 
was consistent across nAMD (87.3%, 580 patients, 514 patient-years of exposure) and 
DME (77.5%, 978 patients, 1685 patient-years of exposure) (Table 13).
Patients in the Phase II program were also mostly White (90.4%, n=347) in the pooled 
population (Annex 7A.10).
Exposure by Ethnicity
The ethnicity of 83.8% of the overall faricimab Phase III safety population was Not 
Hispanic or Latino (1614 patients, 2286 patient-years of exposure) (Table 14).  This was 
consistent across nAMD (88.9%, 590 patients, 521 patient-years of exposure) and DME 
(81.1%, 1024 patients, 1765 patient-years of exposure).
The Phase II program was consistent with the Phase III population, with 90.6% (n=348) 
patients that were Not Hispanic or Latino (Annex 7A.11).

(Yes/No)
Rationale
(if not included as missing 
information)
No
No
To allow unbiased study data 
interpretation. Uncontrolled glaucoma 
could lead to serious complications, 
loss of vision, and need for intervention.
Active inflammation or infection can 
predispose and/or result in serious 
intraocular complications resulting in 
vision loss after an intravitreal injection. 
Reason for exclusion was to minimize 
the possibility of infectious or 
inflammatory complications; inability to 
administer study treatment for a 
prolonged period; impacting possibility 
to interpret study results in an unbiased 
way.
A warning to use with caution in 
patients with poorly controlled 
glaucoma and to not inject faricimab if 
the intraocular pressure is +30mmHg 
is included in the SmPC.
A contraindication in patients with 
active intraocular inflammation is 
included in the SmPC.
A contraindication in patients with 
active or suspected ocular or periocular 
infection is included in the SmPC.

No
Faricimab is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with nAMD, and thus 
should not be administered in patients 
with CNV due to other causes.
The exclusion criterion was selected in 
order to avoid any potential efficacy or 
safety confounders.  No change in the 
safety profile of faricimab is foreseen in 
this patient population. A caution 
regarding the initiation of faricimab 
treatment in patients with factors 
associated with higher risk of RPE tear 
is included in the SmPC under special 
warnings and precautions for use.
Patients with high myopia have a thin 
sclera and retina and are susceptible for 
retinal detachments and tears in 
addition to developing a CNV secondary 
to pathologic myopia and therefore 
potentially confounding the safety and 
efficacy profile for faricimab.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation
No developmental toxicity, teratogenicity, or effect on weight or structure of the placenta 
were observed in nonclinical studies in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys treated with 
faricimab (Report 1053361, Report 1057630, Report 1093222). 
Pregnant women were not eligible for inclusion in the clinical development program of 
faricimab. Faricimab has an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action and is regarded as 
potentially teratogenic and embryo-/fetotoxic.  As a precautionary measure, there is 
guidance in the SmPC to warn against the use of faricimab during pregnancy unless the 
potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Together with the label 
warning and recognizing that in the DME patient population pregnancy is possible, “Use 
in pregnancy” is considered Missing Information for faricimab and will be further 
characterized as data becomes available (see Part II, SVII.3.2 for further information).

Safety Concerns in the RMP
Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Reason for NOT including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP:
Known risks that required no further characterization and are followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilance and for which the risk-minimization messages in the 
Product Information are adhered to by prescribers:

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment/ retinal tear
Intravitreal injection through the retina instead of the pars plana creates the risk of 
causing an iatrogenic retinal hole, which is the cause of most retinal 
tears/detachments associated with intravitreal injections.  A rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment occurs when a break (tear or hole) in the retina leads to fluid passage 
and accumulation and separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying 
retinal pigment epithelium.  Vitreoretinal traction is responsible for most of the 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (Sultan et al. 2020).  In some eyes, strong 
vitreoretinal adhesions are present, and the occurrence of a posterior vitreous 
detachment can lead to the formation of a retinal tear.  The liquefied vitreous can 
then seep through the tear and under the retina, leading to a retinal detachment.
In the Phase III studies with nAMD (i.e., TENAYA and LUCERNE) through Week 48, 
there were no events of retinal detachment / retinal tear reported in the faricimab-
treated patients (Annex 7C.11).  In the Phase III DME studies (i.e., YOSEMITE and 
RHINE) during the entire study, 0.3% of faricimab-treated patients (n=4) 
experienced at least one event of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment / retinal tear
(Annex 7C.12).  Two events of retinal tear were reported as mild, one as moderate
and one event of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment as severe in intensity.  All 
four events were considered serious and were resolved with treatment.  
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was treated with pars plana vitrectomy, and
three retinal tears were treated with laser.
Overall, low incidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tear was 
observed in faricimab clinical trials and was manageable with standard treatment.

Risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tear is a known risk 
associated with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapies.  Based on data 
available to date from the faricimab clinical development program, the risk of 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and retinal tear is shown to be consistent with 
approved intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapies and considered sufficiently 
characterized.  This risk is considered to be adequately addressed within the 
Warnings and Precautions of the product labelling and will be monitored via routine 
PV activities.

Retinal Pigment Epithelial Tear (nAMD Only)
Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear can be part of the natural course of nAMD or 
can occur as a complication following anti-VEGF intravitreal injections.  RPE tears 
most commonly occur in nAMD eyes with a pigment epithelial detachment (PED), 
but the exact mechanism of RPE tear formation is unknown.  Various hypotheses 
have been proposed for tear formation following PEDs that include an increase in 
hydrostatic pressure of serous fluid that collects under the retinal pigment epithelium 
(i.e., within the PED) that ultimately results in a tear to the retinal pigment epithelium 
(Gass 1984).  Important risk factors for RPE tear are the type of PED (vascularized
PED), increased PED height (reports suggest that the larger the PED, the greater 
the risk of RPE tear development), increased surface area, and large basal 
diameter of PED and choroidal neovascularization lesion type (Chan et al. 2010; 
Doguizi and Ozdek 2014; Sarraf et al. 2014).
In the Phase III faricimab safety population with nAMD (i.e., TENAYA and 
LUCERNE) through week 48, 2.9% of patients (n=19) experienced at least one 
event of RPE tear (Annex 7C.11).  Most events were non-serious and not severe.  
Non-serious AEs had minimal impact on long-term visual outcomes, with patients in 
general maintaining visual acuity levels similar to those prior to the AE in the 
majority of cases.  Four patients (0.6%) experienced serious events, of which one 
patient sustained vision loss of ≥30 letters and two patients sustained vision loss of 
≥15 letters up to Week 48 (primary analysis endpoint time).
RPE tear most commonly occurs in nAMD eyes with a PED (i.e., confounded by an 
underlying condition).  Monitoring of risk factors and predictors defined by retinal 
imaging in high-risk patients can contribute to the prevention of RPE tears.  The risk 
factors are adequately described within the Warnings and Precautions of the 
product labelling.  There are no additional risk minimization measures proposed for 
this risk.  Risk of RPE tear is a known risk associated with approved intravitreal anti-
VEGF monotherapies.  Based on the data available to date from the faricimab 
clinical development program, the risk is shown to be consistent with approved 
intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapies and considered sufficiently characterized and 
will be monitored via routine PV activities.

Risks with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated:

Traumatic cataract
Intravitreal injections have been associated with traumatic cataract.  The potential 
risk of traumatic cataract with faricimab treatment is based on the observed 
association of traumatic cataract with the intravitreal injection administration of 
anti-VEGF monotherapy agents.  During the intravitreal injection, any direct trauma 
to the lens by the needle touching the lens could result in traumatic cataract.  
However, no case of traumatic cataract in the study eye was reported in the 
faricimab treatment arms of the completed Phase II studies and Phase III studies
(i.e., up to Week 48 for nAMD studies [TENEYA and LUCERNE] and during the 
entire study for DME studies [YOSEMITE and RHINE]).  Therefore, traumatic 
cataract will remain as a potential risk not important for inclusion in the RMP and will 
be monitored via routine PV activities.
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile:

Transient post intravitreal injection-related intraocular pressure (IOP) increases
Transient IOP increase is attributed to an increase in vitreous volume after faricimab 
injection.  Increases in IOP have been observed while being treated with repeated 
intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF monotherapy agents.
In the Phase III studies of faricimab in nAMD and DME, transient increases in IOP
have been observed within 30±15 minutes of injection.  IOP-increased AEs in the 
study eye were observed in 17 patients (2.6%) in the faricimab arms of the nAMD 
Phase III studies through Week 48 and in 53 patients (4.2%) in the faricimab arms 
of the DME Phase III studies during the entire study (Annex 7C.11, Annex 7C.12).
These AEs of IOP increase were mostly non-serious and self-limiting or managed 
with standard of care.  There were two serious events of IOP increased reported 
(one each in the nAMD and DME studies); one was reported as secondary to 
herpetic uveitis and second was considered related to procedure. Both events 
resolved with treatment.
In addition, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the mean change from 
pre-dose to post-dose IOP across the treatment arms, and there was no observable 
increase in pre-dose IOP from baseline over time.
Based on available data, transient post intravitreal injection-related IOP increases 
are not expected to impact the benefit-risk profile of faricimab; the risk is not 
considered important for inclusion in the RMP, and it will be addressed within the 
Warnings and Precautions of the product labelling.  In addition, risk of transient IOP 
increase is considered sufficiently characterized and monitored via routine PV 
activities.


Immunogenicity
Potential risk factors which may contribute to an induction of a humoral immune 
response (ADA response) to the administered drug in patients include patient- and 
disease-specific factors (e.g., disease state, age, concomitant medications), trial design 
specific factors (e.g., dose level and frequency, duration and route of administration), 
and drug product specific factors (e.g., protein sequence and structure, formulation, 
aggregation and protein modifications, contaminants and impurities).  Consequences for 
ADAs may be, but are not limited to, immune-mediated AEs or AEs related to immune 
complex formation, decrease of efficacy, and alteration of pharmacokinetics.  These risk 
factors were taken into consideration in assessing the likelihood of an immune response 
to faricimab.  This information, in addition to the potential clinical consequences of an 
immune response, including how severe the consequences of an immune response 
might be, were considered in assessing the immunogenicity risk of faricimab in the 
nAMD and DME patient populations. 
The risk of immunogenicity from faricimab was low, with an incidence of ADA 
induction/boosting across all Phase III studies of approximately 10% (nAMD: 10.4%, 
Annex 7C.1 and DME: 9.6%, Annex 7C.2).  Incidence rate of IOI was low and not more 
than 2% in the nAMD and DME Phase III studies (Annex 7C.15 and Annex 7C.17, 
respectively).  Although a higher incidence of IOI was observed in ADA-positive patients 
(nAMD: 5/75 [6.7%], Annex 7C.3 and Annex 7C.4; DME: 15/128 [11.7%], Annex 7C.5
and Annex 7C.6) compared with ADA-negative patients (nAMD: 7/582 [1.2%], Annex 
7C.7 and Annex 7C.8; DME: 5/1124 [0.4%], Annex 7C.9 and Annex 7C.10), this 
observation is not currently considered to be clinically relevant.  Based on the low 
incidence of immunogenicity, the low incidence of IOI for which the majority of the events 
were of mild to moderate severity and had a reversible character.  Patients receiving 
faricimab in clinical trials will continue to be monitored for signs and symptoms that might 
be suggestive of immunogenicity.
IOI events are included in this RMP as important identified risks.  In addition, a 
patient/carer education guide will be provided to facilitate awareness regarding the 
presenting signs and symptoms of these adverse reactions so that they can promptly 
inform the treating physician to ensure appropriate intervention and treatment as 
needed.  The impact of ADA on safety, especially the incidence and severity of IOI 
events, will continue to be monitored via routine PV in all ongoing Phase III faricimab 
studies.
SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety 
Concerns in the RMP
Important Identified Risk of Infectious Endophthalmitis
Risk-benefit impact: 
In total, seven infectious endophthalmitis events have been reported in faricimab-treated 
patients in the clinical development program.  The frequency of infectious 
endophthalmitis in the Phase III studies (GR40306 TENAYA, GR40844 LUCERNE, 
GR40349 YOSEMITE, and GR40398 RHINE) was 6 events (0.3%) (Table 19).  In the 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.3 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
faricimab
65
of
128
Phase II studies, no events were reported in the faricimab 6 mg arms, and the frequency 
of events was 1.0% (1 event) in the pooled (nAMD and DME) faricimab 1.5 mg arm
(Annex 7B.1).  The event rate per-1000 injections in the Phase III studies was 0.3
(Annex 7A.4).  Four events were reported as severe and three as moderate in intensity, 
and all events were considered serious.  All but two events were resolved, one event 
was resolving, and the remaining event had not resolved. All except one patient in 
general achieved visual acuity levels similar to those prior to the AE; the remaining
patient had early termination following event onset, visual acuity was improving at the 
time of last visit.
Infectious endophthalmitis usually presents with sudden onset of decreased vision and 
severe eye pain.  It can result in variable degree of visual loss, including some cases 
reporting total loss of vision and no light perception.  It requires prompt intervention to 
reduce risk of vision loss and maximize recovery potential.  Considering the severity and 
seriousness of these events, it represents an important risk for faricimab.  Although the 
observed events in faricimab-treated patients were serious, they were generally 
manageable with antibiotic and steroid treatment with or without vitrectomy, and the 
overall frequency of infectious endophthalmitis events reported in the faricimab clinical 
development program was low.  Therefore, the impact of infectious endophthalmitis on 
the benefit-risk balance of faricimab is considered low.  Appropriate labelling and 
patient/carer educational materials as a risk minimization activity increases the likelihood 
of an early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment, further reducing the impact of 
infectious endophthalmitis on the benefit-risk balance of the product.
Important Identified Risk of Intraocular Inflammation
Risk-benefit impact: 
IOI including the wide selection of preferred terms of anterior chamber inflammation, 
chorioretinitis, iridocyclitis, iritis, keratic precipitates, keratouveitis, uveitis, and vitritis, 
were reported in 1.7% (n=33) of patients treated with faricimab in the Phase III studies
(Table 21).  The frequency of IOI in the Phase II studies was 3.0% (n=3) in the faricimab 
1.5 mg arms and 1.4% (n=4) in the faricimab 6 mg arms (Annex 7B.2).  All except for 
one event were mild in severity in the Phase II studies.  In the Phase III studies, the 
majority of faricimab-treated patients experienced events that were mild (0.7%, n13) or 
moderate (0.7%, n13) in severity.  Mild or moderate IOI events had no long-term impact 
on patients’ visual outcomes.  Seven (0.4%) patients experienced severe events, of 
which five patients had a visual acuity reduction of ≥15 letters (2 patients) and 
≥30 letters (3 patients).  These severe events were managed with treatment for the AE 
and study drug interruption (2 patients) or discontinuation (5 patients).
IOI can range from a mild inflammation of the eye that may resolve without vision loss to 
severe with sequelae leading to vision loss.  Permanent visual acuity loss of two or more 
lines has been associated with rapid presentation, severely diminished visual acuity at 
presentation, the presence of fibrin, and older patient age.  Considering the low 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.3 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
faricimab
66
of
128
incidence of severe events, and that the majority of intraocular events observed in 
faricimab-treated patients were manageable with standard treatment and that most 
events resolved, the impact on the benefit-risk balance of faricimab is considered low.  
Appropriate labelling and the patient/carer educational materials as a risk minimization 
activity increases the likelihood of an early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment, 
further reducing the impact of IOI on the benefit-risk balance of the product.
Important Potential Risk of Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATE) and 
Central Nervous System (CNS) hemorrhagic events
To account for variations in how thrombotic and hemorrhagic events may be reported, 
CNS hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic CNS vascular conditions and cerebrovascular 
accidents) are included with ATE (as a safety concern for faricimab), in line with the Anti-
Platelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC) defined events which include both thrombotic and 
hemorrhagic events.  
In Phase III studies in nAMD (GR40306 TENAYA and GR40844 LUCERNE) and in 
DME/DR (GR40349 YOSEMITE and GR40398 RHINE), potential APTC events reported 
during the study were adjudicated (according to APTC definition) by an independent 
Clinical Events Committee (CEC) at Cleveland Clinic.  The role of the CEC was to 
adjudicate potential APTC events in a blinded, consistent, and unbiased manner.  
Events based on external adjudication are presented in Table 17 .  ATE and CNS 
hemorrhagic events (adjudicated) were reported in 3.7% (n=71) of patients treated with 
faricimab in the Phase III studies (Table 23).  Overall, incidence of APTC events in the 
faricimab arm was low across all four Phase III studies, and consistent with what has
been observed with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapies (Rosenfeld et al. 
2006; Brown et al. 2009; Schmidt-Erfurth et al. 2014; Heier et al. 2016; Zarbin et al. 
2017; Zarbin et al. 2018).

The frequency of ATE and CNS hemorrhagic events (unadjudicated) in the Phase II 
studies was 2.0% (n=2) in the faricimab 1.5 mg arms and 3.5% (n=10) in the faricimab 
6 mg arms (Annex 7B.3). 
Overall, the majority of faricimab-treated patients experienced severe ATE and CNS 
hemorrhagic events in the Phase III and Phase II trials (refer to Table 23 and Annex 
7B.3, respectively).  While these events have been observed in the faricimab clinical 
development program, most of the events were assessed as unrelated to the study 
treatment by the investigators in all treatment arms, or the events were confounded by 
the patient’s concurrent medical history.
It is well known that there is an increased risk of thromboembolic events and non-ocular 
hemorrhage associated with IV administration of high doses of VEGF-inhibitors used in 
the treatment of cancer.  Cancer itself is also a risk factor for these types of events. 
(Navi et al. 2019).  Yet, there is currently no clear evidence of this class effect leading to 
an increased incidence of systemic thromboembolic events and non-ocular hemorrhage 
when much lower intravitreal doses of VEGF-inhibitors are administered in patients with 
nAMD and DME (Thulliez et al. 2014, Zarbin et al. 2017, Zarbin et al. 2018).  
The systemic exposure to faricimab, following unilateral intravitreal administrations of 
6 mg faricimab is low (refer to Part II Module SII for further details) therefore, systemic 
PD effects including the development of ATEs and non-ocular hemorrhagic events are 
unlikely, and the risk remains potential.
The safety concern of ATE and CNS hemorrhagic events will be further characterized for 
long-term use by two ongoing long-term extension studies (AVONELLE-X and 
RHONE-X).  No additional risk minimization is proposed for this risk as healthcare

professionals are well aware of the class effect related to systemic VEGF inhibition and 
guidance is also provided in the faricimab EU SmPC to sufficiently mitigate this risk.     
Missing Information of Long-term Safety
Benefit-risk impact:
The current overall extent of exposure to faricimab accounts for a limited number of 
patients followed-up for a restricted amount of time (beyond 1 year).  Currently, there is 
data available from the Phase III pivotal studies up to Week 48 for nAMD studies (i.e., 
the time point for primary analysis) and the entire study (through Week 100) for DME 
studies (see Part II: Module SIII).  Although limited long-term safety data are available, 
faricimab is intended for long-term use.  Thus, long-term safety data is being collected 
and monitored from the ongoing long-term extension clinical studies, AVONELLE-X 
(nAMD) and RHONE-X (DME).  Refer to Part III.2, III.3 for further details.
Missing Information of Use in Pregnancy
Benefit-risk impact:
No developmental toxicity, teratogenicity, or effect on weight or structure of the placenta 
were observed in nonclinical studies in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys treated with 
faricimab (Report 1053361, Report 1057630, Report 1093222). 
Pregnant women were not eligible for inclusion in the clinical development program of 
faricimab.  Faricimab has an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action and is regarded as 
potentially teratogenic and embryo-/fetotoxic.  As a precautionary measure, there is 
guidance in the SmPC to warn against the use of faricimab during pregnancy unless the 
potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Together with the label 
warning and recognizing that in the DME patient population pregnancy is possible, “Use 
in pregnancy” is considered Missing Information for faricimab and will be further 
characterized as data becomes available (see Part II, SVII.3.2 for further information).

Improper sterile technique during the administration of the intravitreal injections 
procedure may lead to intraocular contamination with microorganisms, eventually 
leading to infectious endophthalmitis (Avery et al. 2014; Storey et al. 2020).
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
This important identified risk is based on data from the faricimab safety population in the 
Phase III studies (GR40306 TENAYA, GR40844 LUCERNE, GR40349 YOSEMITE, and 
GR40398 RHINE) and the Phase II studies (BP29647 AVENUE, CR39521 STAIRWAY, 
and BP30099 BOULEVARD).
The frequency of endophthalmitis reported with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF 
monotherapies is presented in Table 18.

In an observational study that reported per injection rate of endophthalmitis with other 
anti-VEGF treatments, the rate of endophthalmitis following aflibercept, bevacizumab, 
and ranibizumab intravitreal injections was 0.100% (136/135,973), 0.056% 
(268/481,572), and 0.047% (94/201,013), respectively (Kiss et al. 2018).
Characterization of the risk:
In the Phase III studies with nAMD (i.e., TENAYA and LUCERNE), there were no events 
of infectious endophthalmitis in the study eye reported in the faricimab arms (n=664) 
(Table 19).

Of the 1262 faricimab-treated patients from the Phase III population with DME (i.e., 
YOSEMITE and RHINE), 0.5% of patients (n=6) experienced at least one event of 
infectious endophthalmitis in the study eye (Table 19).  These events were considered 
serious.  Three events were reported as severe and three were reported as moderate in 
severity.  Of the patients with events (n=6), four patients had events that were 
considered resolved, one patient had an event that was resolving, and one patient had 
an event that had not resolved during the entire study (through Week 100).
There was a per-1000 injection rate of 0.3 events of infectious endophthalmitis (Annex 
7A.4) in the overall Phase III population, pooled across both indications.

In the Phase II studies in nAMD, one patient (2.2%) receiving 1.5 mg faricimab 
experienced infectious endophthalmitis in the study eye (Annex 7B.1).  The reported 
event was a serious AE and evaluated as severe.  The event was considered resolved 
by the end of study.
In the Phase II study in DME (BP30099 BOULEVARD), no faricimab patients (n=135) 
experienced endophthalmitis in the study eye.
There was a per-1000 injection rate of 1.44 events of endophthalmitis in the pooled 
faricimab Phase II patients (Annex 7A.6).
Based on data available to date for the clinical development program, the risk of 
infectious endophthalmitis has been sufficiently characterized and the frequency of 
occurrence is shown to be consistent with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF 
monotherapies.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Patients with ocular or periocular infections or patients with active IOI are at increased 
risk of endophthalmitis.  There is an increased risk of endophthalmitis if the intravitreal 
injection procedure is not performed under aseptic conditions.
Preventability:
Use of proper aseptic injection technique when administering faricimab is required to 
minimize the risk of endophthalmitis (Avery et al. 2014, Storey et al. 2020).  Patients with 
ocular or periocular infection should not receive faricimab.  Patients should be monitored 
following the injection and instructed to promptly report symptoms that may be 
associated with endophthalmitis.  These measures would permit early diagnosis and 
treatment, should an infection occur, limiting the possibility of long-term sequelae.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
Endophthalmitis presents with sudden onset of decreased vision and severe eye pain 
that leads to urgent visit to an ophthalmologist.  Cases may develop with variable degree 
of visual loss, including some cases reporting total loss of vision and no light perception, 
which, in time, would lead to phthisis.  An aqueous/vitreous sample tap should be 
performed, and patients treated with standard of care, including intravitreal antibiotic 
injections (e.g., vancomycin and ceftazidime) with or without ophthalmic or intravitreal 
steroids.  An additional component of treatment which may be performed in some 
situations is pars plana vitrectomy.  Full recovery is expected for most cases; however, 
loss of vision and loss of the eye itself has also been reported with cases of 
endophthalmitis (Kresloff et al. 1998, Verma and Chakravarti 2017).  Based on the data 
available to date from the faricimab clinical development program, the reporting rate of 
infectious endophthalmitis following an intravitreal injection of faricimab is low and

reported events were generally manageable with treatment.  The impact of infectious 
endophthalmitis on the benefit-risk balance of faricimab is considered low.
Public health impact:
Infectious endophthalmitis is expected to be uncommon, with a frequency of 1/1,000 to 
1/100 events.
Intraocular Inflammation
Potential mechanisms:
Several potential mechanisms could explain development of IOI after the intravitreal 
injection administration of anti-VEGF agents.  Mechanical injury during the invasive 
injection procedure could elicit a mild intraocular inflammatory response associated with 
the trauma, which may manifest with anterior chamber cells and flare. 
IOI could develop because of a specific immunogenic response to the administered 
protein agent (ADAs) (Baumal et al. 2020) or due to an innate inflammatory reaction 
caused by the active substance or its excipients (Cox et al. 2021).  There is no current 
evidence from the published literature or from the post-marketing data to support the 
occurrence of these events due to immunogenic response in patients treated with the 
currently approved anti-VEGF agents ranibizumab and aflibercept.
Other causes unrelated to intravitreal injection include autoimmune or other 
immune-mediated and inflammatory disorders, infections (e.g., herpes zoster), and eye 
injury or surgery.
Evidence sources and strength of evidence:
This important identified risk is based on data from the faricimab safety population from 
the Phase III studies (GR40306 TENAYA, GR40844 LUCERNE, GR40349 YOSEMITE, 
and GR40398 RHINE) and the Phase II studies (BP29647 AVENUE, CR39521 
STAIRWAY, and BP30099 BOULEVARD).
The frequency of IOI reported with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapies is 
presented in Table 20.

Characterization of the risk:
For the purposes of reporting of IOI, iritis, iridocyclitis, and vitritis are types of uveitis 
reported based on the anatomical location of inflammation (Jabs et al. 2005).
In the Phase III faricimab safety population with nAMD (i.e., TENAYA and LUCERNE), 
2.0% of patients (n=13) experienced at least one event of IOI in the study eye 
(Table 21).  Five events (0.8%) were considered serious.  By severity,  a mild event was 
experienced by 0.9% (n=6) of patients, moderate in 0.6% (n=4) of patients and severe in 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.3 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

0.5% (n=3) of patients.  Of the patients with events, one (7.7%) patient had at least one 
event that was considered not recovered/resolved and two (15.4%) patients had at least 
one event recovering/resolving by Week 48.
By Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Term, 0.5% of 
patients (n=3) experienced iridocyclitis, 0.5% of patients (n=3) experienced iritis, 0.3% of 
patients (n=2) experienced uveitis, and 0.5% of patients (n=3) experienced vitritis in the 
Phase III nAMD population (Annex 7C.15).  The per-1000 injection rate by Preferred 
Term was 1.18 for iridocyclitis and 0.71 for iritis, uveitis, and vitritis (Annex 7C.16).
In the faricimab arms from the Phase III safety population with DME (i.e., YOSEMITE 
and RHINE), 1.6% of patients (n=20) experienced at least one event of IOI in the study 
eye (Table 21).  Four patients (0.3%) experienced at least one serious event.  By 
severity, the most severe event was mild in 0.6% (n=7) of patients, moderate in 0.7% 
(n=9), and severe in 0.3% (n=4).  Of the patients with events, one (5.0%) patient had at 
least one event that was considered not recovered/resolved, two (10.0%) patients had at 
least one event resolved with sequelae, and six (30.0%) patients had at least one event 
recovering/resolving.
By MedDRA Preferred Term, 0.6% of patients (n=7) experienced uveitis, 0.4% of 
patients (n=5) experienced iritis, 0.4% of patients (n=5) experienced iridocyclitis, 0.2% of 
patients (n=2) experienced post procedural inflammation, and 0.2% of patients (n=2) 
experienced vitritis in the Phase III DME population (Annex 7C.17).  The per-1000 
injection rate by Preferred Term was 0.56 for uveitis, 0.31 for both iritis and iridocyclitis,
and 0.13 for both post procedural inflammation and vitritis (Annex 7C.18).
In the overall Phase III population pooled across both indications, the per-1000 injection 
rate of IOI events was 2.08 (Annex 7A.4).

In the Phase II studies in nAMD, 6.5% of patients (n=3) receiving 1.5 mg faricimab and 
2.0% of patients (n=4) receiving 6 mg faricimab experienced IOI in the study eye (Annex 
7B.2).  One event in the 1.5 mg arm was serious.  All events were mild except for one 
reported as severe.  The majority of events resolved by end of study.
In the Phase II study in DME (BP30099 BOULEVARD), no faricimab patients (n=135) 
experienced IOI events in the study eye.
There was a per-1000 injection rate of 4.31 and 2.04 events of IOI in the 1.5 mg and 
6 mg pooled faricimab Phase II patients, respectively (Annex 7A.6).
Based on data available to date for the clinical development program, the risk of IOI has 
been sufficiently characterized and the frequency of occurrence is shown to be 
consistent with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapies.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Patients with ocular or periocular infections or patients with known hypersensitivity to 
faricimab or any of the excipients are at increased risk of IOI.  IOI could develop 
because of a specific immunogenic response to the administered protein agent (positive 
ADAs).
Preventability:
Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering faricimab.  
In the post-marketing setting, patients should be instructed to report any signs or 
symptoms of IOI such as pain, photophobia, or worsening redness, which might be a 
clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity.  These measures would permit early 
diagnosis and treatment, should an inflammation occur, limiting the possibility of long-
term sequelae.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
IOI can range from a mild inflammation of the eye to severe with sequelae leading to 
vision loss.  Symptoms can consist of blurred vision, floaters, pain, and photophobia.  
Pain is significantly associated with severe vitreous or anterior chamber inflammation.  
IOI associated with intravitreal administration of VEGF inhibitors may resolve without 
vision loss.  Treatment is typically non-invasive, consisting of observation alone or 
topical corticosteroids.  This can be supplemented with topical antibiotics, cycloplegics, 
or systemic corticosteroids.  More invasive interventions have also been employed, 
including in-office vitreous tap, intravitreal antibiotics, and PPV (Agrawal et al. 2013; Cox 
et al. 2021).  Severe vision loss has been reported in some cases of posterior uveitis 
such as retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically occurring in the 
presence of IOI (Novartis 2020; Witkin et al. 2020).

frequency of occurrence and the severity of these events is outweighed by the overall 
benefit of faricimab.
Public health impact:
IOI is expected to be common, with a frequency of 1/100 to 1/10 events.
SVII.3.1.2 Information on Important Potential Risks
Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATE) and Central Nervous System (CNS) 
hemorrhagic events
Potential mechanisms:
Interaction of VEGF with VEGF-receptor on endothelial cells (ECs) induces production of 
nitric oxide and prostaglandin I2, both of which are important for EC survival, 
proliferation and migration, vasodilatation, as well as maintenance of the integrity and
antithrombotic/antiadherent state of the EC lining.  Inhibition of the VEGF pathway may 
therefore impair angiogenesis, disrupt vascular integrity, and disturb the normal EC 
interaction with platelets. This may compromise the integrity of the EC lining and 
promote platelet aggregation, thereby increasing the risk of ATE events (Chen and Cleck 
2009).
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
This important potential risk is based on data from the faricimab safety population in the 
Phase III studies (GR40306 TENAYA, GR40844 LUCERNE, GR40349 YOSEMITE, and 
GR40398 RHINE) and the Phase II studies (BP29647 AVENUE, CR39521 STAIRWAY, 
and BP30099 BOULEVARD).
The frequency of ATE and CNS hemorrhagic events reported with approved intravitreal 
anti-VEGF monotherapies is presented in Table 22.

Characterization of the risk:
Of the 664 faricimab-treated with patients from the Phase III safety population with
nAMD (i.e., TENAYA and LUCERNE), 1.1% of patients (n=7) experienced at least one
adjudicated APTC-defined event (Table 23).  All seven patients had severe events, and 
all were considered serious.
Of the 1262 faricimab-treated patients from the Phase III safety population with DME 
(i.e., YOSEMITE and RHINE), 5.1% of patients (n=64) experienced at least one 
adjudicated APTC-defined event (Table 23).  Of these, 4.0% of patients (n=51) had 
severe events and 1.0% of patients (n=12) had moderate events. Most of these events 
were considered serious.  
In the overall Phase III population pooled across both indications, the per-1000 injection 
rate of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events (adjudicated) was 3.51 (Annex 7A.13).

In the Phase II studies in nAMD, one patient (2.2%) receiving 1.5 mg faricimab and 
seven patients (3.4%) receiving 6 mg faricimab experienced an ATE/CNS hemorrhagic 
event (unadjudicated) (Annex 7B.3).  Six patients experienced events that were serious 
(one patient in the 1.5 mg faricimab arm, and five patients in the 6 mg faricimab arm).  
In the Phase II studies in DME, one patient (1.8%) receiving 1.5 mg faricimab and three 
patients (3.8%) receiving 6 mg faricimab experienced an ATE/CNS hemorrhagic event 
(unadjudicated) (Annex 7B.3).  Two patients experienced events that were serious (both 
reported in the 6 mg faricimab arm).  
There was a per-1000 injection rate of 2.87 and 6.13 events of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic 
events (unadjudicated) in the 1.5 mg and 6 mg pooled faricimab Phase II patients, 
respectively (Annex 7A.14).
Risk factors and risk groups:
nAMD is associated with CV disease and the risk factors include moderate to severe 
hypertension, raised high density lipoprotein levels, and anatomic measures of 
atherosclerotic disease.  Patients with nAMD with comorbidities such as hypertension, 
arrhythmias, or a previous history of myocardial infarction and cerebral vascular
accidents have an increased risk of experiencing ATEs (Alexander et al. 2007).  The 
majority of subjects in ranibizumab trials who experienced an ATE had a medical history 
that included  1 cardiovascular risk factors and were  75 years old (Rosenfeld et al. 
2006.
DME is more common in older patients with T2DM.  The risk of CV diseases in diabetic 
patients increases by two to threefold (hypertension increases the prevalence of DME to 
threefold) (Acan et al. 2018).  There is also a correlation between patients with DR and 
CV disease, who are at an increased risk of stroke and heart failure (Bandello et al. 
2020).  In a retrospective cohort study (US) (20062015) with DME patients that had a 
history of cerebrovascular and CV diseases, the prevalence of myocardial infarction, CV
disease, stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic attack was 5.5%, 13%, 
5.2%, 0.38%, and 3.3% respectively (Maloney et al. 2019).
Preventability:
Patients with CV comorbidities or a previous history of myocardial infarction and cerebral 
vascular accidents are at an increased risk of ATE events.  Due to the lack of early 
warning signs of onset of most ATEs, patients with known risk factors should be 
informed of this risk and monitored following faricimab intravitreal injection.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
A few ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events are associated with serious and life-threatening 
consequences, particularly in high-risk patients and in certain clinical settings.  However, 
the incidence rate of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events has been low in the overall faricimab

clinical development program and most of the events were assessed as unrelated to the 
study treatment by the investigators, or the events were confounded by the patient’s 
concurrent medical history.
Also, considering no suppression from baseline in VEGF-A or ANG-2 was observed in 
plasma of patients dosed with faricimab in the Phase III studies (popPK Report, Report 
1105763) and that the incidence of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events in the faricimab arm 
was consistent with what have been observed with approved intravitreal anti-VEGF 
monotherapies, the risk of ATE events associated with faricimab remains theoretical like 
other intravitreal treatments. Therefore, the impact of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events on 
the benefit-risk balance of faricimab is considered low.
Public health impact:
While the risk of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events remains theoretical with faricimab 
treatment, the incidence of ATE/CNS hemorrhagic events is expected to be common 
(frequency of 1/100 to 1/10 events) in nAMD and DME patients with underlying risk 
factors.
SVII.3.2 Presentation of the Missing Information
Information on Missing Information
Long-term Safety
Evidence source:
Patients are expected to receive faricimab over a long treatment duration.  The faricimab 
safety population provides data from 1926 patients with 2740 years person-time of 
exposure in the Phase III program (see Part II: Module SIII). The duration of exposure 
achieved during the clinical development program of faricimab is not yet sufficient to 
determine any difference in the safety profile in patients with long-term exposure.
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information:
The safety profile of faricimab has been well characterized in the clinical trial setting and 
continues to be analyzed.  The safety profile in long-term use is not expected to be 
significantly different to the current knowledge of the safety profile.
Long-term safety data will be collected and monitored from the ongoing long-term 
extension studies: AVONELLE-X (nAMD) and RHONE-X (DME).  Refer to Part III, III.2
for further details.
Use in Pregnancy
Evidence source:
Given that the prevalence and incidence of nAMD increases with age, and the disease is 
most prevalent in patients  65 years of age (Li et al. 2020a) there is a low likelihood that 
female patients on treatment for nAMD will be of childbearing potential.

The data on the prevalence of pregnancy in the DME population are limited.  Prevalence 
estimates for presence of DME at any time during pregnancy ranged from 5% to 27% in 
T1DM and 4% in T2DM (Morrison et al. 2016).
Although pregnancy in this patient population is possible, the likelihood is low, and there 
is low systemic exposure to faricimab after ocular administration; the rapid plasma 
clearance of faricimab resulted in systemic plasma exposure approximately 6000-fold 
lower than in the vitreous.  In plasma, mean Cmax of 0.2 g/mL was reached after 
approximately 2 days post-dose.  No apparent suppression of free VEGF-A and free 
Ang-2 was observed in plasma of patients receiving faricimab in the Phase III studies 
(TENAYA, LUCERNE, YOSEMITE, and RHINE), consistent with the low faricimab 
plasma levels. 
Furthermore, in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, the faricimab serum exposure (Cmax at 
the NOAEL dose of 3 mg/kg) was more than 500-times greater than the faricimab 
human steady-state systemic exposure estimates, and did not reveal any developmental 
toxicity, teratogenicity, or effect on weight or structure of the placenta (Report 1053361;
Report 1057630; Report 1093222). 
While pregnant women were not eligible for inclusion in the clinical development 
program of faricimab, a total of three pregnancies (YOSEMITE [n=1] and RHINE [n=2]) 
have been reported during the conduct of the Phase III studies (all in DME treated 
patients); one in the faricimab personalized treatment interval (PTI) arm and two in the 
aflibercept Q8W arm (Annex 7A.12). The patient in the faricimab PTI arm received a 
total of 4 injections of study treatment prior to the confirmation of pregnancy and 
underwent permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to pregnancy.  The patient 
had a normal delivery with an APGAR score within the expected range (CSR 
YOSEMITE narratives, Report 1102956, p. 1655).
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information:
Faricimab has an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action and is regarded as potentially 
teratogenic and embryo-/fetotoxic, and for this reason there is precautionary guidance in 
the SmPC to warn against the use of faricimab during pregnancy unless the potential 
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. In addition, recognizing that pregnancy 
is possible in the DME patient population, the use of faricimab in pregnant patients will 
be closely monitored, following Roche’s standard pregnancy follow-up process (refer to 
Part III.1 for further details). In addition, pregnancy cases will be summarized in Periodic 
Safety Update Reports (PSURs)/ Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRERs).

POST-AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES)
III.1 ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
The following routine pharmacovigilance activities have been implemented beyond 
adverse reaction reporting and signal detection for faricimab: 
Specific guided questionnaire for the following important identified risks:
–
–
infectious endophthalmitis
intraocular inflammation
The purpose of the guided questionnaire is to ensure the adequate follow-up of 
post-marketing case reports and the robust collection of all of the appropriate information 
deemed necessary to further characterize the important identified risks associated with 
faricimab.  The guided questionnaire is provided in Annex 4 of the RMP.
The Roche standard pregnancy follow-up process has also been implemented for all 
products to request additional information on the medication history of the exposed 
parent, relevant medical history for the mother and father, previous obstetric history, the 
current pregnancy, fetal and infant conditions, and results of tests and investigations for 
any pregnancy complication or congenital abnormality during pregnancy or within the 
first year of the infant’s life.  Cumulative data will be presented in PSURs/ PBRERs.
III.2 ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
Two long-term extension studies (AVONELLE-X and RHONE-X) are currently ongoing to 
evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of intravitreal faricimab, which will address 
the missing information of long-term safety of faricimab and will provide a cumulative 
4 years of exposure data (Table 25 and Table 26).

Patient/Carer Guide
Patient/carer guide will promote awareness of the information 
contained within the Vabysmo Package Leaflet.  It aims to inform 
patients/carers adequately on the risks, the key signs and
symptoms of those risks, and when to seek urgent attention from 
their physician with the objective to minimize the important 
identified risks of infectious endophthalmitis and intraocular 
inflammation, and to promote communication between the patient 
and their physician.
To provide instructions to patients for early recognition of key 
signs and symptoms of potential adverse reactions, and timely 
reporting to their physicians, encouraging prompt intervention to 
reduce the risk of vision loss and to maximize recovery potential.
The guide is targeted to use in adult patients with nAMD and 
DME, and it is provided to the physician for distribution to the 
patient after faricimab is prescribed to them, but prior to their first 
administration.
How effectiveness will be measured:
 Distribution metrics of patient educational materials
 Monitoring of reporting rate and severity of infectious 
endophthalmitis and intraocular inflammation, through 
routine pharmacovigilance (i.e., observed vs expected 
analysis)
Milestones for reporting:
 Periodically in PSURs/PBRERs

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PLAN
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VABYSMO (FARICIMAB)
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Vabysmo.  The RMP details 
important risks of Vabysmo, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Vabysmo’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
Vabysmo’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vabysmo should 
be used.
This summary of the RMP for Vabysmo should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of
Vabysmo’s RMP.
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Vabysmo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with neovascular (wet) 
age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular oedema (DME) (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains faricimab as the 
active substance, and it is given by intravitreal injection.
Further information about the evaluation of Vabysmo’s benefits can be found in
Vabysmo’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web
site, under the medicine’s Web page.
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of Vabysmo, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Vabysmo’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
–
–
–
Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.3 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
faricimab
112
of
128
–
The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Vabysmo, these measures are supplemented with additional 
risk-minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks below:
 Patient/Carer Guide
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. Also, a guided questionnaire has been designed to 
ensure the adequate follow-up of adverse events and the robust collection of all of the 
appropriate information deemed necessary to further characterize the important 
identified risks associated with Vabysmo.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vabysmo is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing Information” below.
II.A LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION
Important risks of Vabysmo are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vabysmo.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT RISKS
Important Identified Risk: Infectious Endophthalmitis
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
This important identified risk is based on data from the 
faricimab safety population in the Phase III studies 
(GR40306 TENAYA, GR40844 LUCERNE, GR40349 
YOSEMITE, and GR40398 RHINE) and the Phase II 
studies (BP29647 AVENUE, CR39521 STAIRWAY, and 
BP30099 BOULEVARD).
Patients with ocular or periocular infections or patients with 
active intraocular inflammation are at increased risk of 
endophthalmitis.  There is an increased risk of 
endophthalmitis if the intravitreal injection procedure is not 
performed under aseptic conditions.

Risk factors and risk groups
This important identified risk is based on data from the 
faricimab safety population from the Phase III studies 
(GR40306 TENAYA, GR40844 LUCERNE, GR40349 
YOSEMITE, and GR40398 RHINE) and the Phase II 
studies (BP29647 AVENUE, CR39521 STAIRWAY, and 
BP30099 BOULEVARD).
Patients with ocular or periocular infections or patients with 
known hypersensitivity to faricimab or any of the excipients 
are at increased risk of intraocular inflammation.  
Intraocular inflammation could develop because of a 
specific immunogenic response to the administered protein 
agent (positive anti-drug antibodies).

Draft Key Messages of the Additional Risk-Minimization Measures
Prior to the launch of Vabysmo in each Member State, the Marketing Authorization 
Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational programme, 
including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the 
programme, with the National Competent Authority.
The educational programme is aimed at adequately informing patients/carers on the 
risks of Vabysmo, the key signs and symptoms of those risks, and when to seek urgent 
attention from their physician with the objective to minimize the risks and any resultant 
complications by encouraging prompt intervention.
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Vabysmo is marketed, all 
patients/carers who are expected to use Vabysmo have access to both written and audio 
versions of the educational material (i.e., the patient/carer guide).

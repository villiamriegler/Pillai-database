n/a 
60000-001 (CASSIOPE) listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP. This is a prospective, non-imposed and 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
In differentiated thyroid carcinoma, dose reductions and 
dose interruptions occurred in 67% and 71% respectively 
of cabozantinib treated patients in the clinical trial 
(COSMIC-311). Two dose reductions were required in 33% 
of patients. The median time to first dose reduction was 57 
days and to first dose interruption was 38.5 days.  
The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the 
DTC population (≥1% incidence) are diarrhoea, pleural 
effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism,  hypertension, 
anaemia, deep vein thrombosis, hypocalcemia, 
osteonecrosis of jaw, pain, palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome,  vomiting and renal 
impairment. 
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade 
(experienced by at least 25% of patients) in the DTC 
population included diarrhoea, PPES, hypertension, fatigue, 
decreased appetite, nausea, alanine aminotransferase 
increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased and

recommended dose of CABOMETYX is 60 mg once daily. 
Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer 
clinically benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable 
toxicity occurs. Management of suspected adverse drug 
reactions may require temporary treatment interruption 
and/or dose reduction of CABOMETYX therapy. When dose 
reduction is necessary, it is recommended to reduce to 40 
mg daily, and then to 20 mg daily. Dose interruptions are 
recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or 
greater toxicities or intolerable grade 2 toxicities. Dose 
reductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, 
could become serious or intolerable. If a patient misses a 
dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 
12 hours before the next dose. 
Osteonecrosis: Events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
have been observed with cabozantinib. An oral examination 
should be performed prior to initiation of cabozantinib and 
periodically during cabozantinib therapy. Patients should be 
advised regarding oral hygiene practice. Cabozantinib 
treatment should be held at least 28 days prior to 
Page 10/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if 
possible. Caution should be used in patients receiving 
agents associated with ONJ, such as bisphosphonates. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who 
experience ONJ. 
The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the 
RCC population (≥1% incidence) are abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, nausea, hypertension, embolism, 
hyponatraemia, pulmonary embolism, vomiting, 
dehydration, fatigue, asthenia, decreased appetite, deep 
vein thrombosis, dizziness, hypomagnesaemia and palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES).   
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade 
(experienced by at least 25% of patients) in the RCC 
population included diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, decreased 
appetite, PPES, hypertension, weight decreased, vomiting, 
dysgeusia, constipation, and AST increased. Hypertension 
was observed more frequently in the treatment naïve RCC 
population (67%) compared to RCC patients following prior 
VEGF-targeted therapy (37%). 
The most common serious adverse drug reactions in the 
HCC population (≥1% incidence) are hepatic 
encephalopathy, asthenia, fatigue, PPES, diarrhoea, 
hyponatraemia, vomiting, abdominal pain and 
thrombocytopenia. 
The most frequent adverse reactions of any grade

3, Randomized, Controlled Study of Cabozantinib 
(XL184) vs Everolimus in Subjects with Metastatic 
Renal Cell Carcinoma that has Progressed after Prior 
VEGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy, to fulfil the 
condition to the marketing authorisation listed as a 
PAES in the Annex II. The RMP version 2.0 has also 
been submitted. 
2) C.I.4 (type II) 
Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC to reflect the final 
study results from non-clinical study XL184-NC-036: 
104-Week Oral Gavage Carcinogenicity and 
Toxicokinetic Study with Cabozantinib (XL184) in 
Rats. The RMP version 2.0 has also been submitted. 
3) C.I.3.z (type IB) 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to implement the 
wording agreed by the PRAC following the outcome 
of the PSUR procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/10180/201603. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives. 
The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been 
evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and 
Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study XL184-NC-036, cabozantinib-related neoplastic 
findings consisted of an increased incidence of benign 
pheochromocytoma, alone or in combination with 
malignant pheochromocytoma/complex malignant 
pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla in both sexes at 
exposures well below the intended exposure in humans. 
The clinical relevance of the observed neoplastic lesions in 
rats is uncertain. 
A statistically significant improvement in progression free 
survival (PFS) was demonstrated for Cabometyx compared 
to everolimus. A planned interim analysis of overall survival 
(OS) was conducted at the time of the PFS analysis and did 
not reach the interim boundary for statistical significance 
(202 events, HR=0.68 [0.51, 0.90], p=0.006). In a 
subsequent unplanned interim analysis of OS, a statistically 
significant improvement was demonstrated for patients 
randomized to CABOMETYX as compared with everolimus 
(320 events, median of 21.4 months vs. 16.5 months; 
HR=0.66 [0.53, 0.83], p=0.0003). Comparable results for

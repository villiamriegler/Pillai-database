The pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib were evaluated in five 
update the information on renal impairment based 
on final results from study 2215-CL-0114, listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. Study 2215-CL-0114 is 
a phase 1, single-dose, open-label study to 
investigate the effect of renal impairment on 
gilteritinib pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability 
in 9 participants with severe renal impairment 
subjects with severe (CrCL 15 - <30 mL/min) renal 
impairment and in four subjects with end stage renal 
disease (CrCL <15 mL/min). A 1.4-fold increase in mean 
Cmax and 1.5 fold increase in mean AUCinf of gilteritinib 
was observed in subjects with severe renal impairment or 
end stage renal disease compared to subjects with normal 
renal function (n=8). No dose adjustment is necessary in 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

CL-0101, 2215-CL-0102 and 2215-CL-0301 have 
completed at least 3 years of treatment with 
gilteritinib or have withdrawn prior to completing at 
least 3 years of treatment. The studies refer to: 1) 
study 2215-CL-0101: a phase 1/2 open-label, dose 
escalation study investigating the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
ASP2215 (gilteritinib) in patients with relapsed or 
refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML); 2) study 
2215-CL-0102: a phase 1 open-label, dose escalation 
study investigating the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
ASP2215 in Japanese patients with relapsed or 
refractory AML; 3) study 2215-CL-0301: a phase 3 
open-label, multicentre, randomized study of 
ASP2215 versus salvage chemotherapy in patients 
with relapsed or refractory AML with FMS-like 
tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation. The RMP (version

Section 5.2 Transporter drug drug interactions;section is 
modified to reflect new data: 
In vitro experiments demonstrated that gilteritinib is a 
substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Gilteritinib may potentially 
inhibit BCRP, and P gp, OATP1B1 in the small intestine, and 
OCT1 in the liver at clinically relevant concentrations (see 
section 4.5).

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
AbbVie Limited submitted on 2 March 2017 a group of variation(s) consisting of an extension of the 
marketing authorisation and the following variation(s): 
Variation(s) requested 
C.I.4 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, 
preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Type 
II 
The MAH applied for a new strength/potency (20 mg) for adalimumab solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe. In addition, the MAH proposed an update of sections 4.2 of the SmPC in order to introduce 
new fixed dose regimen (posology) for the paediatric indications of Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis, Paediatric Crohn's disease, and Paediatric Uveitis. The Package Leaflet and 
Labelling are updated accordingly. Furthermore, the marketing authorisation holder took the 
opportunity to introduce editorial changes to align wording and layout of the Product Information and 
to amend the statement relating to anti-adalimumab antibody development in JIA patients, which will 
reside in section 5.1 of the Humira SmPCs (20 mg and 40 mg presentations). 
The MAH applied for the following indication for Humira 20 mg solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe:  
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Humira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case 
of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for 
the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in patients aged less than 
2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age 
and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy 
(see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents 
from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for 
topical therapy and phototherapies. 
Paediatric Crohn's disease  
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or 
have contraindications for such therapies.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
This procedure concerns changes to a Fixed Dose (FD) posology for the paediatric indications JIA, ERA 
(currently body surface area [BSA] dependent posology) and Ps (currently body weight [BW] 
dependent posology). FD is proposed also for the new indication uveitis which has been evaluated in a 
parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163). No changes are proposed in the paediatric indications 
for which a fixed-dose posology is already applied (CD, HS). The changes are reflected in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC for the new dose-strength 20 mg prefilled syringe, that is included as a line extension in this 
application, as well as the changes proposed in the SmPCs for the currently approved presentations. 
Furthermore the applicant proposes to add a statement on immunogenicity in JIA in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC referring to data from a previous procedure. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology and clinical presentation 
JIA 
Chronic arthritis in childhood is a heterogeneous group of diseases.  The currently used International 
League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification distinguishes the following JIA 
categories:  
•  Systemic arthritis (sJIA)  
•  Polyarthritis rheumatoid factor (RF) negative  
•  Polyarthritis RF positive  
•  Oligoarthritis (2 subcategories based on joint count beyond 6 months)  
• 
• 
Persistent (not more than 4 joints)  
Extended (more than 4 joints)  
•  Psoriatic arthritis (JIA-PsA) 
•  Enthesitis related arthritis (ERA)  
•  Undifferentiated arthritis  
JIA refers to arthritis of at least 6 weeks duration of unknown aetiology that begins in children less 
than 16 years old. JIA has an annual incidence of 2-20 cases per 100 000 population and a prevalence 
of 16-150 cases per 100 000 population. JIA is less common than RA in adults but it is one of the most 
common systemic autoimmune diseases in children and adolescents. Children of all age groups may be 
affected although onset during the first year of life is rare and restricted predominantly to sJIA. In 
some of the categories girls predominate whereas in ERA boys predominate, and there are racial 
differences in incidence and relative frequency of JIA categories.  
RA, axial spondyloarthritis, and PsA are diseases in adults that correspond most closely to individual 
categories of JIA with similar clinical manifestations and underlying immunologic mechanisms (i.e. 
polyarticular JIA, ERA and JIA-PsA, respectively). They all are covered by the overarching condition: 
chronic idiopathic arthritis (including RA, axial spondyloarthritis, PsA and JIA). (EMA Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
EMA/CHMP/239770/2014).

Psoriasis 
Psoriasis is a common, genetically determined, inflammatory and proliferative disease of the skin, the 
most characteristic lesions consisting of chronic, sharply demarcated, dull-red scaly plaques, 
particularly on extensor parts of limbs and in the scalp. Psoriasis affects 1.5 to 3% of the general 
population in Europe. The first manifestation of psoriasis may occur at any age. Two peaks of onset are 
frequently reported: in the second and third decades and about the age of 60. In 3% of patients, 
psoriasis begins in childhood. Patients with a family history of psoriasis tend to have an earlier age of 
onset. The duration may vary from a few weeks to a whole lifetime. The clinical course is unpredictable 
but in the majority of cases psoriasis is a chronically remitting and relapsing disease (Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of psoriasis, 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/2454/02). 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Although the aetiology and pathogenesis of JIA are not fully understood, it is known that JIA shares 
many of the pathological abnormalities that have been identified in RA. At the same time multiple 
differing pathogenesis and phenotypic features exist between the JIA categories. Increased production 
of cytokines in different forms of JIA (e.g.interleukin-1ß and interleukin-6 in sJIA, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α) in polyarticular JIA) in conjunction with osteoclastic cell activation leads to 
degradation of adjacent cartilage and bone. Increased knowledge of these factors including 
understanding their genetic background may help to redefine the classification of JIA in terms of 
aetiology, response to treatment, risk of relapse or prognosis. (EMA Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, EMA/CHMP/239770/2014). 
Psoriasis is considered to be caused by a genetic-environmental interaction. Smoking, alcohol 
consumption, diet, psychological stress, infections and physical trauma have been suggested as factors 
which may influence the onset of the disease and/or may affect severity or response to treatment. The 
pathogenesis of psoriasis is still incompletely understood. A genetically determined skin disorder as a 
cause of the infiltration of lesions with activated T cells, interaction between dermal antigen-presenting 
cells, and activation of neutrophils and T cells has been postulated. The histochemistry of psoriatic 
lesions and therapeutic response of chronic plaque psoriasis to T-cell targeting therapy such as 
ciclosporin A are also in favour of this hypothesis (Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products indicated for the treatment of psoriasis. EMEA/CHMP/EWP/2454/02). 
2.1.3.  Management 
JIA 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered a first–line treatment option in most 
cases of newly diagnosed JIA, followed by intra-articular glucocorticosteroids and disease modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The latter include both synthetic (methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine) 
and biological DMARDs. The introduction of biological therapies has resulted in a significant advance in 
therapy for JIA. (EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, EMA/CHMP/239770/2014).Five biologic agents are approved for the 
treatment of pJIA: adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, abatacept and tocilizumab.

Topical therapies such as glucocorticosteroids, vitamin D derivatives, or combinations of both are 
usually sufficient to manage mild psoriasis. Practicability (time needed to apply 
treatment),convenience, and adverse effects such as skin irritation limit the use of topical drugs. A 
combination of phototherapy and systemic therapy is needed for patients with moderate-to-severe 
disease. Established systemic drugs for the treatment of psoriasis include methotrexate, ciclosporin, 
acitretin, and in some countries fumaric acid esters. In the past decade, several biologics have been 
developed and approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Additionally, the oral phosphodiesterase 4 
inhibitor apremilast has been approved for adults. TNFα inhibitors etanercept, adalimumab, and 
infliximab are approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and golimumab has been 
approved for psoriatic arthritis. Ustekinumab, a drug that blocks interleukin 12 and 23, is also 
approved for both indications. Ustekinumab interferes with the development of Th17 lymphocytes, 
which are important effector cells in psoriatic inflammation. Secukinumab was approved in adults as 
the first biological blocking IL-17A, a key effector cytokine produced by TH17 and other cells. 
(Boehncke et al, Lancet. 2015 Sep 5;386(9997):983-94). 
About the product 
Adalimumab is a fully human antibody that binds specifically to TNF-α and neutralizes the biological 
function of TNF-α by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF-α receptors. 
Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF-α. After 
treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] 
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines rapidly decrease. 
In the EU, the approved indications for adalimumab in paediatric patients are JIA (polyarticular JIA 
[pJIA] and ERA), paediatric Ps, adolescent HS, and paediatric CD, as reflected in the Humira® 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
2.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
This procedure concerns changes to the posology for the paediatric indications JIA, ERA (currently 
BSA-dependent posology) and Ps (currently BW-dependent posology). FD is proposed also for the new 
indication uveitis which is currently being evaluated in a parallel procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163). No changes are proposed in the paediatric indications for which a fixed-
dose posology is already applied (CD, HS). See summary of currently approved and proposed posology 
in the table below.

a.  Posology is for dosing every other week. 
b.  Posology is weekly for the first 2 doses and every other week thereafter. 
c.  Application currently under review. 
No new clinical data was submitted in support of this application. Instead new analysis of existing 
clinical data was submitted.  
A central scientific advice was given regarding the issue was received in June 2016 
(EMA/SAWP/401051/2016). Several points were raised including the following: 
1. The proposed posology in the SA Briefing material was for pJIA: 10 kg to < 15 kg 10 mg every 
other week, 15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week and ≥  30 kg 40 mg every other week. For ERA, 
the proposed posology was: 15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week≥  30 kg 40 mg every other 
week. In this SA it was stated that: ” CHMP acknowledges that on a population level, the proposed 
fixed-dose regimen will likely produce similar exposure as compared to the BSA-based dosing for 
patient with body weights > 15kg. However, as shown in Figure 3 of the briefing package, for the 
weight group < 15 kg the proposed fixed-dose regimen will decrease exposure as compared to the 
BSA-based dose regimen” and “PedACR30 response rate was shown to be lower in the quartile of 
patients with the lowest exposure (70 versus 90 percent), however, this difference is larger for the 
PedACR50 response ratio (50 versus 90 percent). Even if PedACR30 is the primary endpoint, all data 
has to be taken into account especially given the limited amount of data that is available. Based on the 
lower efficacy in the lower exposure quartile group and given the fact that the below 15 kg patients will 
have the tendency for underdosing, this should be carefully evaluated”.

The currently proposed posology for pJIA differs from the posology proposed in the SA Briefing 
material; the dose is currently proposed to be 20 mg for children with weight 10-30 kg and 40 mg for 
children>30 kg.  
2. The proposed posology in the SA Briefing material for Paediatric plaque psoriasis was: 15 kg to < 40 
kg 20 mg every other week and ≥  40 kg 40 mg every other week. The CHMP stated that: “From the 
data provided by the applicant, it appears that patients between 30 and 40 kg are expected to receive 
a lower FD, compared to the BW-calculated dose. This aspect was discussed during the discussion 
meeting and for Ps there is a pronounced correlation between clinical efficacy and exposure levels, 
without a significant effect on safety (for safety see below). Hence it seems advisable to revise the 
proposed cutoff of 40 kg and lower this to 30 kg. The applicant argued that analysis of AE rates in 
relation to administered adalimumab dose (0.4 mg/kg versus 0.8 mg/kg) or observed serum 
adalimumab concentrations in paediatric Ps patients indicated no association between AE rate and 
adalimumab dose or exposure. However, the possible consequences on safety of doubling of AUC 
exposure in the lightest children have not been sufficiently addressed by the applicant, and this will be 
expected to be part of the application for the variation.” 
The revision regarding cut-off proposed by the CHMP has been implemented in the posology proposed 
in the current application. 
3. In the SA it was also stated that: “CHMP agrees that there is enough data to support the claim that 
variations in adalimumab doses in individual patients, compared to doses calculated based on BSA, 
have a low probability to induce an increased risk of adverse events. In particular, the data provided 
by the applicants in their document show no increase in infectious side effects in patients exposed to 
higher adalimumab doses. Infectious side effects in JIA patients are related to multiple factors, 
including the use of corticosteroids. Because of the corticosteroid-sparing effect of adalimumab in 
patients with JIA, the overall risk-benefit balance still leans in favour of adalimumab, even after dose 
adjustments based on BW thresholds.” 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
• 
 Legal basis - Legal basis: This is application is for a Line Extension to add a new dose strength (20 
mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe ) grouped with type II variation,  according to Article

2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this line extension application is to introduce a 20 mg strength for the adalimumab 100 
mg/mL formulation in a single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation for use in approved Humira 
paediatric indications.  
The 100 mg/mL formulation of adalimumab solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection was first approved 
through variation EMEA/H/C/000481/II/138/G (40 mg in PFS) and EMEA/H/C/000481/II/145/G (40 mg 
in Autoinjector). Subsequently a 80 mg in PFS was approved through line extension 
EMEA/H/C/000481/X/0157.  
Assessment report

The new 20 mg presentation has the same, active substance, formulation and container closure 
system as the approved 40 and 80 mg strengths of the 100 mg/mL formulation. The only difference is 
the volume of solution filled into the syringe. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
There are no changes declared for the active substance part of Module 3.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process for the 20 mg PFS is comparable to the validated process 
for the already approved 100 mg/mL FS. Only some minor adaptions have been made to the 
manufacturing process (mixing speed, mixing time, fill volume and stopper position), which have been 
sufficiently described in the documentation. 
The manufacturing, packaging and testing sites are generally the same as those established for the 
already approved 40 mg/0.4 mL and the 80 mg/0.8 mL PFS and no new sites have been added. The 
extent of specific testing performed by the registered manufacturers has been slightly changed.  
The unit operations and controls comprising the finished product manufacturing process for the 20 
mg/0.2 mL PFS is comparable to the validated process for the already approved 40 mg/0.4 mL and 80 
mg/0.8 mL PFS, with minor adaptions. The manufacturing process for the 20 mg/0.2 mL PFS was 
validated The acceptance criteria for all process validation lots were met.  Reproducibility and 
robustness in manufacturing were demonstrated. 
The 20 mg/0.2 mL PFS is supplied in a 1 mL single-use syringe for subcutaneous administration 
(Becton Dickinson (BD) Hypak Physiolis Sterile, Clean, and ready-to-Fill (SCF) syringe system) This is 
the same container closure system as utilized by the already approved 40 mg/0.4 mL PFS and 80 
mg/0.8 mL PFS. 
Product specification  
The specification for the 20 mg/0.2 mL PFS is identical as the one to the already approved 40 mg/0.4 
mL and 80 mg/0.8 mL PFS, except it does not include measurement of the plunger breakout and 
gliding forces for filled syringes intended for autoinjector use, since an autoinjector presentation is not

provided for the 20 mg dose. All other tests, analytical methods and acceptance criteria are identical to 
the already approved 40 mg/0.4 mL and 80 mg/0.8 mL PFS. The finished product specification include 
tests for appearance (visual), identity, purity, potency, protein quantity, pH, osmolality, visible and 
sub-visible particulate contamination and extractable volume. Appropriate specifications have been set 
to control the active substance and finished product, both at release and at the end-of-shelf life. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been provided for production scale batches for 20 mg/0.2 mL PFS. The 
batches are representative of the adalimumab 100 mg/mL formulation and commercial process and all 
are being evaluated in stability studies. The provided batch data comply with the release specifications. 
Reference materials 
The reference materials are identical to those already approved for the 40 mg/0.4 mL and 80 mg/0.8 
mL PFS.  
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life (24 months) and storage conditions (Store in a 
refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the pre-filled syringe in its outer carton in order to 
protect from light. A single Humira pre-filled syringe may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum 
of 25°C for a period of up to 14 days. The syringe must be protected from light, and discarded if not 
used within the 14-day period.) as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Real time/real condition (5°C) stability data of commercial scale batches of finished product for 
accelerated (25°C/60% RH) and stressed (40°C/ 75% RH) conditions according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of Adalimumab 20 mg/0.2 mL PFS are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The currently available 
stability data for 20 mg/0.2 mL PFS batches meet the pre-defined acceptance criteria under the 
recommended storage conditions The reported stability data are considered sufficient to support the 
application of a 24 month shelf-life at 5°C with an additional 14 days room temperature (≤ 25°C) 
storage  available to the product end-user. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information provided to support this line extension has been presented in a satisfactory manner. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of the new presentation 20 mg PFS is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
The MAH confirms that there have been no changes in the pharmaco-toxicological evaluation for 
Adalimumab since the last updates of Module 2.4 and Module 4 submitted with Variation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017

138G/Sequence Number 0229 (HC 40 mg pre-filled syringe) and Variation 146/Sequence Number 
0229 (Uveitis). 
The local tolerance study TE09-259 (R&D/10/297) and the conclusions from the nonclinical overview 
submitted with variation 138G are also valid for this application. 
The CHMP deems the available non-clinical package acceptable to support this variation. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The data that support the FD regimens of adalimumab are from clinical trials and from a post-approval 
commitment to the FDA/PIP requirement of the EMA. These studies have been conducted in patients 
with pJIA (Studies DE038, M10-240 [Japan], M10-444, and P10-262 [STRIVE]), ERA (Study M11-328), 
paediatric Ps (Study M04-717), paediatric CD (Studies M06-806, M06-807, and P11-292 [CAPE]), and 
paediatric uveitis (the SYCAMORE study). Study reports have been previously submitted for these 
studies. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of adalimumab are well characterized in paediatric 
subjects in the approved indications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; specifically the categories of 
polyarticular JIA [pJIA] and enthesitis-related arthritis [ERA]), paediatric psoriasis (Ps), and paediatric 
Crohn's disease (CD).  These data have previously been assessed. 
The proposed FD regimen is supported by population PK modelling and exposure response analyses 
evaluating multiple potential FD regimens with BW cutoffs for adalimumab in paediatric subjects with 
JIA (pJIA and ERA) and paediatric Ps.  PK simulations were conducted using a population PK model 
that was developed previously based on adalimumab concentration data across different paediatric 
Assessment report

indications in order to evaluate adalimumab PK across the paediatric age range and across the 
different disease populations.  Exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety were conducted in 
order to assess the potential clinical impact of PK differences associated with the FD regimens 
compared to current dosing based on BSA or BW for JIA and paediatric Ps, respectively. 
A summary of paediatric studies is listed in the table below.

A paediatric population PK model was previously developed based on adalimumab concentration data 
from a total of 524 paediatric subjects enrolled in studies of polyarticular JIA (Studies DE038 and M10-
444), paediatric ERA (Study M11-328), psoriasis (Study M04-717), and CD (Study M06-806), as 
presented in PK Report, and in the EU variation procedure EMEA/H/C/481/II/134, assessing the use of 
adalimumab for the treatment of Ps in paediatric patients from 4 years of age and also in the EU 
variation procedure EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0154, supporting the use of adalimumab for the treatment of 
HS in adolescent patients.  Subject demographics included an age range of 2 to 18 years and body 
weights from 11 to 120 kg. The final model parameter estimates were used to conduct PK simulations 
to evaluate potential fixed-dose regimens and compare expected concentrations to those using the 
BSA- and BW-based dosing regimens currently approved for JIA (pJIA and ERA) and paediatric Ps, 
respectively. 
Standard methods have been used for population PK modelling and exposure simulations. The 
previously developed population PK model, based on data PK data in children 2-17 years old, describe 
the paediatric PK data sufficiently well according to the goodness-of-fit diagnostics and visual 
predictive checks. 
In this application, serum adalimumab concentrations from each dosing regimen were compared for 
different BW categories in order to evaluate the potential FD options.  The distribution of the simulated 
Week 12 pre-dose serum adalimumab concentrations by BW and dosing regimen for JIA patients are 
shown in Figure 1.

Dosing Regimen (Without MTX [Top], with MTX [Bottom]) 
For the overall JIA population, as shown above, simulated serum adalimumab trough concentrations 
were also generally comparable between BSA-based dosing and the potential FD scenarios when 
stratified by BW categories.  All observed trends were consistent regardless of concomitant use of MTX. 
Additionally, to evaluate the potential FD options in the PS patient population, serum adalimumab 
concentrations from each dosing regimen were compared for different BW categories.  The 
distributions of the simulated Week 11 pre-dose serum adalimumab concentrations for each dosing 
regimen are presented in Figures 2 and 3 by relevant BW or age category.

Figure 3.  Distribution of Simulated Week 11 Serum Adalimumab Trough Concentrations by BW 
Categories Corresponding to Currently Approved 0.8 mg/kg Dosing Regimen in Paediatric Ps 
The most notable differences between potential FD scenarios were observed for subjects with BW from 
30 kg to 40 kg and ages 4 to < 6 years (Figure 2) and BW < 17 kg and from 29 kg to 41 kg (Figure 3).  
For subjects aged from 4 to < 6 years and with BW < 17 kg, both FD regimens generated 
approximately 2-fold higher concentrations than the 0.8 mg/kg regimen.  For subjects with BW 
between 29 kg and 41 kg, the FD regimens with the 30-kg BW cutoff generated slightly higher 
adalimumab concentrations than the 0.8 mg/kg regimen and approximately 2-fold higher 
concentrations than the 40-kg cutoff, while the FD regimen with the 40-kg BW cutoff produced lower 
serum adalimumab concentrations than the 0.8 mg/kg regimen. 
The slight under prediction of the observed median (which can be corrected with a more appropriate 
handling of LLOQ data) is considered acceptable. No differences in the adalimumab pharmacokinetics 
between indications were detected hence the paediatric population PK model is considered adequate 
for use of simulating adalimumab exposure (concentrations) for evaluating fixed-dose regimens in 
paediatric patients.  
In JIA patients, the simulated trough concentrations given the proposed 20/40 mg dose, display higher 
levels in patients with body weights <15 kg, and 30 to 40 kg compared to the approved 24 mg/m2 
dosing regimen. Although for both weight groups there is a large overlap with the concentrations from 
the approved regimen. The explored alternative dosing regimen of 10/20/40 mg (15/30 kg cut-offs) 
display lower concentrations than the approved dosing regimen.   
For Ps patients, the simulated trough concentrations display higher levels in patients with body weights 
<23 kg, compared to the approved 0.8 mg/kg dose. This is expected since patients <25 kg will receive 
a higher dose (20 mg) compared to the per body weight dosing. Also patients with body weights 30-40 
kg display higher concentrations than the approved dosing regimen. However, the 40 kg cut-off 
provided slightly lower concentrations compared to the 0.8 mg/kg regimen. 
Adalimumab Exposure-Efficacy Relationship in the Paediatric Population 
Exposure-response analyses for efficacy were conducted in order to assess the potential clinical impact 
of PK differences associated with the FD regimens in subjects with JIA and paediatric Ps.  The 
Assessment report

relationship between adalimumab exposure and efficacy in JIA suggests that there is a modest 
exposure-response relationship, whereas the relationship between adalimumab exposure and efficacy 
in paediatric Ps suggests that there is a clear exposure-response relationship. 
Evaluation of Relationship Between Adalimumab Exposure and Efficacy Using Logistic 
Regression Analysis in pJIA 
A logistic regression based statistical analysis was also conducted to evaluate the relationship between 
observed adalimumab exposure and the probability of achieving a PedACR30 or PedACR50 response.  
Baseline joint count and MTX co-medication were tested as covariates on minimum response and on 
EC50.  Only MTX co-medication was found to be significant on minimal response.  The results of the 
logistic regression analysis are shown in Figure 4 There was an exposure-response relationship 
between adalimumab concentration and PedACR response rates in subjects with pJIA.

Relationship Between Adalimumab Exposure and Efficacy Using Logistic Regression Analysis 
in Paediatric Subjects with Ps 
A logistic regression based statistical analysis was also conducted to evaluate the relationship between 
observed adalimumab exposure and the probability of achieving a PASI 75 or PGA 0,1 response.  The 
relationship was described with a logistic regression (with random effects) model as shown in Figure 5.  
Baseline PASI score was not statistically significant as an independent predictor of achieving the two 
ranked primary efficacy endpoints in Study M04-717.

Evaluation of the Relationship Between Observed Adalimumab Concentration and Safety in 
Paediatric Subjects 
The range of concentrations expected with the proposed FD regimens, based on population PK 
simulations, has been observed in paediatric subjects, with associated safety information presented in 
Figure 6 for JIA subjects, Figure 7 for Ps subjects, and Figure 8 for CD subjects with no apparent 
relationship between adalimumab concentrations and safety events.  In addition, data from previous 
adalimumab development programs in adults includes doses up to 10 mg/kg intravenous for 6 months 
and 3 mg/kg for up to 2 years, plus doubling of approved sc doses in multiple indications (RA, Ps and 
CD), showing a similar safety profile across doses and exposures.

The analyses of PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 show a clear exposure-response relationship, indicating that the 
response increases with increasing adalimumab concentration. The PASI75 model does also indicate 
that a sigmoidal Emax model with a steeper slope might be more appropriate, however an improved 
model is not expected change the proposed dosing regimen. 
The graphical analyses between adalimumab concentration and safety events display no indication of a 
relationship between adalimumab concentration and adverse events. However, for completeness, the 
applicant has been asked to provide graphs of serious infections and injection site reactions versus 
adalimumab concentration, respectively.  
The Applicant has provided the requested graphs of serious infections in CD (Figure 9 and 10) and 
injection site reactions in CD, JIA and PS (Figures 9 to 12) versus adalimumab concentration. 
Visualisations for Serious Infections have not been generated for JIA and PS due to the very low 
numbers.

2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The application included no new PD data. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has provided adequate population PK modelling and simulations to evaluate the adalimumab 
exposure in the paediatric population, over several indications, given the proposed posology compared 
to the approved posology. Graphical display indicates that adequate functions have been used to 
account for the correlations between body weight and body surface area in the simulations. 
In JIA patients, the simulated trough concentrations given the proposed 20/40 mg dose, display higher 
levels in patients with body weights <15 kg, and 30 to 40 kg compared to the approved 24 mg/m2 
dosing regimen. Although for both weight groups there is a large overlap with the concentrations from 
the approved regimen. The explored alternative dosing regimen of 10/20/40 mg (15/30 kg cut-offs) 
display lower concentrations than the approved dosing regimen.   
For Ps patients, the simulated trough concentrations display higher levels in patients with body weights 
<23 kg, compared to the approved 0.8 mg/kg dose. This is expected since patients <25 kg will receive 
a higher dose (20 mg) compared to the per body weight dosing. Also patients with body weights 30-40 
kg display higher concentrations than the approved dosing regimen. However, the 40 kg cut-off 
provided slightly lower concentrations compared to the 0.8 mg/kg regimen. 
Adequate methods have been used in the adalimumab exposure-response analysis. All investigated 
exposure-efficacy relationships indicate increasing effect with increasing adalimumab concentration. 
The PEDACR30/50 and Change in active joint count analyses suggest that the upper concentration 
range is approaching maximum effect (Emax), while there is a lower response in the lower 
concentration range. The PEDACR30 model (for patients without MTX) indicate that a sigmoidal Emax 
model with a steeper slope might be more appropriate, however an improved model is not expected 
change the proposed dosing regimen.    
The analyses of PASI 75 and PGA 0,1 show a clear exposure-response relationship, indicating that the 
response increases with increasing adalimumab concentration. The PASI 75 model does also indicate 
that a sigmoidal Emax model with a steeper slope might be more appropriate, however an improved 
model is not expected change the proposed dosing regimen.  
The graphical analyses between adalimumab concentration and safety events display no exposure-
safety relationship of concern. 
Data are consistent across indications and can be extrapolated to other indications. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The paediatric population PK model based on adalimumab in several indications is appropriate for 
evaluating a potential fixed-dose regimen in paediatric patients across indications. 
Some deviations between the fixed-dose regimen of 20/40 mg (30 kg cut-off) and the previous body 
size adjusted dosing regimens are present, with a general trend for slightly higher concentrations with 
the new dosing regimen. 
All evaluated exposure-efficacy relationships display a general trend that increasing adalimumab 
concentrations lead to a beneficial response. Further, the exposure-safety relationships display no 
exposure-safety relationship of concern.

2.6.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.1.  Dose response studies and main studies 
Main clinical studies with efficacy data 
For JIA, four studies have been presented to support the variation (as described above). These are 
performed in patients with pJIA (DE038, M10-240 and M10-444) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA, 
study M11-328). For psoriasis, data are available from a study in paediatric plaque psoriasis (M04-
717). The main clinical study to support this variation is DE038, where subjects treated with 
adalimumab in a BSA-based dose were transitioned to a FD, and change in PedACR 30/50/70/90 were 
compared between patients receiving a lowered/unchanged dose versus patients receiving a higher 
dose. 
Clinical efficacy in pJIA, DE038: 
Study DE038 was a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, DB, stratified, parallel-group study in children 
(4 to 17 years old) with polyarticular JIA that were either treated or not treated with MTX. The study 
consisted of 4 phases: a 16-week Open-label Lead-in (OL LI), a 32-week DB phase, an up to 136-week 
Open-label Extension Body Surface Area (OLE BSA) phase, and an up to 224-week Open-label 
Extension Fixed-Dose (OLE FD) phase. Consequently, the total study duration could have been up to 
408 weeks (102 months). The dosing by BSA was 24 mg of adalimumab per square meter (m2) up to 
a maximum of 40 mg total body dose administered SC eow. The dosing by FD in subjects weighing less 
than 30 kg was 20 mg of adalimumab SC eow and 40 mg SC eow in subjects weighing 30 kg or more. 
Non-MTX-treated subjects who were eligible for study enrollment could have been either naïve to MTX 
or withdrawn from MTX at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration. MTX-treated inadequate 
responders must have had active disease on MTX treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening. 
A schematic presentation of the study design is found in the figure below.

Figure 13. DE038 Study Design 
The open-label extension of the study allows a comparison between the BSA dose and FD. It should be 
noted, however, that these individuals are those who responded to adalimumab in earlier phases of the 
study. Subjects who did not respond to therapy in the open-label phase were discontinued from the 
study. A total of 128 subjects completed the DB phase and entered the OLE BSA phase. 106 subjects 
completed the OLE BSA phase and entered the FD phase; of these 62 subjects (58%) completed the 
OLE FD phase. In the OLE BSA phase, discontinuation was of the following reasons: 9 withdrew 
consent, 6 for ‘other reasons’ and 4 due to lack of efficacy. In the OLE FD phase, 44/106 (41.5%) 
prematurely discontinued primarily due to following reasons: lost to follow-up (13/106), ‘other’ reasons 
(13/106), withdrawal of consent (9/106), or lack of efficacy (3/106). Efficacy analyses were performed 
on the ITT population, however, it must be kept in mind that these patients were all primarily 
responders in earlier phases of the study. 
Clinical efficacy in pJIA in Japanese patients, study M10-240 
Study M10-240 was a Phase 3, single-arm, open-label safety, efficacy, and PK study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy (measured as PEDIACR30) of fixed-dose regimen of adalimumab in 25 Japanese 
paediatric subjects 4 through 17 years of age with active pJIA. The study was also designed to confirm 
the similarity between the data obtained from the Japanese subjects and those from Study DE038 in 
Western subjects. Adalimumab was given in combination with MTX (20 patients) or as monotherapy (5 
patients). A 20-mg FD regimen with a 30-kg weight cut-off was used in Study M10-240. According to 
the study protocol, subjects weighing less than 30 kg were to be dosed with 20 mg of adalimumab 
every other week. Subjects weighing 30 kg or more were to be dosed with 40 mg of adalimumab every 
other week.

Clinical safety and efficacy in pJIA, study M10-444: 
This was a phase 3b, open-label, postmarketing study aiming to evaluate the safety of adalimumab in 
subjects 2 to < 4 years of age and in subjects age 4 years and above weighing < 15 kg, with 
moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course JIA. Primary endpoint was the 
incidence of SAEs and AEs. The secondary objectives of this study were to collect pharmacokinetic (PK) 
data (including anti-adalimumab antibody analysis [AAA]) and to evaluate the effectiveness of 
adalimumab in these subjects. Of the 32 subjects included, 84.4% were on concomitant MTX. The 
dosing was 24 mg/m2 BSA (up to 20 mg) eow SC. 
Clinical efficacy in ERA, study M11-328 
In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study, 46 patients (6 to 17 years 
old) with active ERA were randomised to adalimumab in a BSA-based dose or placebo, in monotherapy 
or in combination with DMARDs. The dosing was 24 mg/m2 BSA (up to 40 mg) eow SC. 
Clinical efficacy in plaque psoriasis, study M04-717 
This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study evaluating safety and efficacy of two dosing 
regimens of adalimumab versus methotrexate in 114 paediatric patients, 4 through 17 years of age, 
with severe chronic plaque psoriasis. All patients received a body-weight dosing regimen, either 0.8 
mg/kg up to 40 mg or 0.4 mg/kg up to 20 mg. The 0.8 mg/kg dose is the approved dose. Co-primary 
endpoints were proportion of patients in adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg group vs MTX achieving ≥PASI 75 at 
week 16 and proportion of subjects achieving PGA 0.1 at week 16.  
Summary of main efficacy results 
Clinical efficacy in pJIA, study DE038: 
Study DE038 consisted of 4 phases, including an open-label lead-in phase (OL LI), a double-blind 
phase, an open-label extension (OLE) BSA phase, and an OLE FD phase.  For the 106 subjects enrolled 
in the FD phase, the transition from the OLE BSA phase to the OLE FD phase resulted in an increased 
(n=53), unchanged (n=50) or decreased (n=3) adalimumab dose. The paediatric American College of 
Rheumatology (PedACR) 30/50/70/90 response rates observed in the OLE BSA phase were, according 
to the MAH, maintained by greater than 90% of subjects through the duration of the OLE FD phase, 
regardless of whether the subjects' adalimumab dose remained the same, increased, or decreased. 
Results are provided in Table 4-Table 7 and Figure 14-Figure 16 below.

When comparing outcome measures (pedACR30/50/70/90) between individuals with same/decreased 
dose versus increased dose, no statistically significant differences were seen in pedACR30/50/70. For 
pedACR90, there was a difference at Week 12 visit for patients comparing patients with an increased 
dose vs patients with decreased dose (66.7% vs 0%, p=0.03). Patients with maintained dose were not 
included in this analysis. When performing stratified analysis per age category, there were some 
differences. At Week 32 and at the Final visit, a greater proportion of subjects aged 9 to 12 years with 
increased doses were PedACR70 responders (100% at Week 32 and 95.7% at final visit) compared to 
subjects with the same/decreased doses (62.5% at Week 32 and 55.6 at final visit, p=0.014-0.015). 
At Week 48 and 96, a greater proportion of subjects aged 9 to 12 years with increased doses were 
PedACR90 responders (90.5 at Week 48 and Week 96) compared to subjects with the same/decreased 
doses (55.6% at Week 48 and 42.9% at Week 96, p=0.049/0.021).  
Baseline characteristics differed somewhat between the groups, where more subjects in the 
same/decreased dose group were positive for RF than in the increased dose group. In addition, more 
subjects in the increased dose group had high CRP levels than in the same/decreased dose group.  
Among the subjects in the same/decreased dose, only 3 received a decreased dose (2 on monotherapy 
and 1 on combination with MTX). Thus, only 3/106 subjects received a decreased dose, while 50/106 
subjects remained on the same dose and 53/106 subjects had their dose increased.  
Clinical efficacy in pJIA in Japanese patients, study M10-240 
The results from this study demonstrated, according to the MAH, that a fixed-dose regimen of 
adalimumab 20 mg eow (<30 kg) or 40 mg eow (≥30 kg) was effective in reducing disease activity. 
PEDACR30 response rate was 92% (23/25 patients). 
There were no indications of low efficacy from the study M10-240, in which a FD-regimen identical to 
the one currently proposed for pJIA was used. However, the number of subjects included in the study 
was low and there was no control group which limits the conclusions that can be drawn. 
Clinical efficacy in pJIA, comparison of PedACR30/50/70/90 Results in a Subgroup Weighing 15 to < 30 
kg in Studies DE038 and M10-240 
In Study M10-240, Japanese subjects weighing < 30 kg (specifically, 15 to < 30 kg) received a 20-mg 
FD of adalimumab.  Although the number of subjects in this weight category is small (N = 8), it allows 
a comparison with the matching weight category from the OL LI phase of Study DE038 in which 53 
Western subjects received BSA-based dosing of adalimumab.  The PedACR30/50/70/90 response at 
Week 16 was similar, despite different dosing regimens (Table 8).

From an efficacy perspective, individuals with weight <30 kg are of special interest since they, with the 
new proposed dosing regimen, will receive the lower FD of 20 mg. The number of responders in this 
weight group has been compared between study DE038 and M10-240. The number of patients is small 
and thus no safe conclusions can be drawn, however no big differences can be shown. 
Clinical safety and efficacy in pJIA, study M10-444: 
In this open-label study in children 2 to <4 years old or age 4 and above weighing less than 15 kg, 32 
children with moderately to severe active pJIA were included. Results are shown in Table 9.

Table 7 
PedACR30/50/70/90 Response at Week 12 and Week 24 (ITT Population) 
This was primarily a safety study as part of a submission for an extended indication for adalimumab, 
from 4 to 17 years of age to 2 to 17 years of age. All patients in this study were of <15 kg weight and 
the maximal given dose was 20 mg. Therefore, the efficacy is not expected to be negatively affected in 
this population when applying the FD regimen, since all subjects will receive a FD of 20 mg. 
Overall, the clinical efficacy results from this study, which used BSA-dosing, are of limited interest for 
the current application. 
Clinical efficacy in ERA, study M11-328 
The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints 
with arthritis, which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% in adalimumab patient 
compared to –11.6 in subjects in the placebo group (P = 0.039).  Results are shown in Table 10 below, 
where results are compared across studies. 
This study demonstrates the efficacy of adalimumab in ERA, but all patients were given a BSA-based 
dose and no direct conclusions can be drawn on the clinically efficacy of a fixed-dose regimen. 
Clinical efficacy in paediatric plaque psoriasis (M04-717) 
Proportion of subjects achieving ≥PASI 75 was significantly higher in adalimumab treated subjects 
compared to placebo, which was one of the primary endpoints. The other primary endpoint, proportion 
of subjects achieving PGA 0.1, was not met.  
No results are available to compare clinical efficacy in paediatric psoriasis between the current (0.8 
mg/kg BW in 5 mg increments up to 40 mg) and proposed (20 mg (15 kg to < 30 kg) and 40 mg (≥ 
30 kg)) posologies. The proposed change in posology must therefore be supported only by PK data/ 
simulations. PK-simulations demonstrated similar adalimumab concentrations for FD regimens and BW-
based regimens see data above.

2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No new studies have been conducted to support this variation. Data has been obtained from previously 
submitted studies in pJIA, ERA and psoriasis. In study DE038, subjects with pJIA who were started on 
a BSA dose were switched to a FD and efficacy outcomes were compared between the two regimens. 
In study M10-240, 25 Japanese subjects with pJIA were treated with a FD adalimumab (20 or 40 mg). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 42/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study M10-444, 32 subjects with pJIA with a body weight of <15 kg were treated with a BSA dose 
of adalimumab. Study M11-328 included 46 subjects with ERA treated with a BSA dose or placebo. 
Finally, in study M04-717, 114 subjects with paediatric plaque psoriasis were treated with BW-based 
adalimumab dose.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The analysis of pharmacokinetic data and pharmacokinetic modelling is considered pivotal in this 
assessment, while clinical data is considered supportive. The clinical efficacy of the new proposed FD 
regimen is mainly supported by the results of the DE038 study in pJIA and the small study M10-240 in 
Japanese patients. In DE038, PED ACR30/50/70 responses were maintained after transition from BSA 
dose to FD, which is a direct comparison of the present and proposed regimens.  
It is agreed with the MAH that response rates observed in the OLE BSA phase and the OLE FD phase of 
DE038 were generally similar. However, the design of the study makes the interpretation of the 
efficacy results difficult.All patients included in this open-label extension of the study had responded to 
adalimumab in earlier phases of the study. As stated in the advice given by CHMP, dose requirements 
in patients having already responded to a drug are less stringent than in patients initiating the 
treatment, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the results. Given the small number 
of patients actually receiving a lower dose with the FD regimen, it is not expected to have a major 
negative impact on the efficacy outcomes. The fact that of the106 subjects who completed the OLE 
BSA phase, only 62 subjects (58%) completed the OLE FD phase is to be taken into account for the 
interpretation of data. 
In summary, the outcome of the DE038 does not point to decreased efficacy for a FD dosing in which 
subjects weighing less than 30 kg was dosed 20 mg of adalimumab SC eow and subjects weighing 30 
kg or more was dosed 40 mg SC eow compared to dosing by BSA; 24 mg of adalimumab per square 
meter (m2) up to a maximum of 40 mg SC eow. The study design clearly limits the conclusions that 
can be drawn from the data on clinical efficacy outcomes under the different dosing regimens. Still, 
this is probably not a major issue since in DE038, only 3/106 subjects received a decreased dose with 
the FD dosing compared with the BSA dosing and a similar outcome is expected if the FD dosing is to 
be introduced in clinical practice. I.e. one would expect that only a minority of JIA subjects would 
receive a lower dose with the proposed FD regimen compared to the current BSA regimen and thus 
reduced efficacy is not expected. 
Regarding psoriasis, no results are available to compare clinical efficacy between the current (0.8 
mg/kg BW in 5 mg increments up to 40 mg) and proposed (20 mg (15 kg to < 30 kg) 40 mg (≥  30 
kg)) posologies. The proposed change in posology must therefore be supported based on PK data.  
Data is also obtained from a small study in Japanese patients with pJIA, a study in pJIA subjects of 
<15 kg weight and from studies in ERA. In these studies, no direct comparison has been made 
between the two dosing regimens. Thus for ERA, similarly as for psoriasis, the new dosing cannot be 
supported by clinical efficacy data but only by PK modelling and simulations. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary no big differences in efficacy can be expected, since with the proposed FD posology, the 
majority of subjects are expected to increase dose and exposure (see pharmacokinetic section). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 43/63 
 
 
 
 
 
advantage with a more uniform posology across indications can thus be endorsed from a clinical 
efficacy perspective. 
2.7.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to the FD regimen derives from the open-label phase of the placebo-controlled study DE038 
in JIA, the Japanese open label study M10-240 in JIA, the post marketing observational registry study 
P10-262 in JIA, the phase 3 double blind study M06-806 in CD, the open label study M06-807 in CD, 
the post marketing observational registry study P11-292 in CD and the placebo-controlled, double 
masked study SYCAMORE in uveitis. Mean cumulative dose and mean duration of exposure for the 
studies referred to, are summarized by the applicant, see table below.

l. Mean cumulative dose (mg) not available. As of 01 June 2016, a mean total of 23.17 doses of adalimumab have been administered (SYCAMORE) 
Overall, it should be kept in mind that the analysis of pharmacokinetic data and pharmacokinetic 
modelling is considered pivotal in the assessment of the new proposed FD-regimen while clinical data 
is considered complementary.  
Relevant safety data for the present application stem primarily from JIA study DE038 and uveitis study 
SYCAMORE. Data from the other mentioned studies are considered supportive but of limited value due 
various reasons such as small study population, dosing that differs from the proposed dosing that this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 44/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
procedure pertains to and difficulties to interpret comparisons between studies and geographical 
regions. 
Of note, there are specific exposure and clinical safety data for the proposed FD-dose regimen for only 
two of the paediatric indications, pJIA and uveitis, for which the applicant aims to introduce the new 
dosing regimen. The uveitis indication is the focus of a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163) 
but the data from the uveitis population provide some support for the JIA indication as the populations 
overlap. There are no specific clinical safety data from FD-dosing for the ERA and the Ps population, 
instead the assessment entirely dependent on the PK analysis and modelling and extrapolations from 
the other indications. This is acceptable given the similarities of the populations but still a limitation. 
Adverse events 
Data from pJIA study DE038 
DE038 (Art46), the study was a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, DB, stratified, parallel-group study 
in children (4 to 17 years old) with pJIA that were either treated or not treated with MTX. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of disease flare in the adalimumab-treated subjects compared to placebo 
treated subjects in the non-MTX stratum during the DB phase, occurred at Week 48. One of the 
secondary pharmacokinetic objectives of study DE038 was to compare the pharmacokinetics of FD eow 
based on body weight to variable eow dosing based on BSA of subjects rolled-over into the OLE FD 
phase of the trial whose pharmacokinetic samples were drawn. The study consisted of 4 phases: a 16- 
week Open-label Lead-in (OLLI), a 32-week DB phase, an up to 136-week Open-label Extension Body 
Surface Area (OLE BSA) phase, and an up to 224-week OLE FD phase. In the OLE BSA phase of Study 
DE038, subjects received OL adalimumab SC eow based on their BSA (i.e., 24 mg/m2 BSA up to a 
maximum of 40 mg total body dose). In the OLE FD phase, subjects received either 20 mg of 
adalimumab SC eow (if weighed < 30 kg) or 40 mg of adalimumab SC eow (if weighed ≥  30 kg), 
which is the posology being proposed in this submission. Subjects who met all entry criteria were 
enrolled into one of the 2 strata; with or without concomitant MTX). Subjects who responded positively 
to the OL therapy, as determined by PedACR30 response, entered the DB period. Subjects who 
experienced disease flare during the DB period or subjects who completed the DB period were given 
the option to enter the OLE period. Of the 171 subjects enrolled in the study, 128 entered the OLE BSA 
phase, 106 entered the OLE FD phase and 62 completed the OLE FD phase. The majority of subjects 
either remained on the same dose (50/106 subjects) or had their dose increased (53/106) in the OLE 
FD phase compared to the OLE BSA phase. 
A side-by-side comparison of the exposure-adjusted rates for subjects in the OLE BSA and OLE FD 
phases of Study DE038 who received at least 1 dose of OLE FD study drug were presented by the 
applicant. The incidence rates for any AEs was 512.4/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 287.6/100 PYs in 
the FD phase. Incidence rates for serious AEs was 12.6/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 8.2/100 PYs in 
the FD phase. Incidence rates for infections was 146.4/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 99.4/100 PYs in 
the FD phase. Incidence rates for serious infections was 2.5/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 0.7 in the 
FD phase. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in both study phases were upper respiratory tract infection and 
viral infections. Injection site reactions and injection site pain was more frequent in the OLE BSA 
dosing phase than in the OLE FD dosing phase while symptoms from the joints  appeared to be 
somewhat more frequent in the OLE FD phase. The incidence rates for injection site reaction related 
AES were 148.4 E/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 9.3E/100 PYs in the FD phase. No deaths were 
reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 45/63 
 
 
 
 
The applicant presented an analysis of the TEAEs reported by subjects weighing 15 to < 30 kg in the 
OLE BSA phase (378.6 AEs/100 PYs, n=12) and OLE FD phases of Study DE038 (229.2 AEs/100 PYs, 
n=12). AEs were also presented according to whether the subjects increased their dose in the FD 
phase. In study DE038 (94.3% had any AE) or received the same/decreased dose in the FD phase 
compared to the BSA phase (90.6% had any AE).  
The incidence rates for total number of AEs were lower during the OLE FD phase compared to the OLE 
BSA phase in study DE038. The incidence rates for serious AEs was also lower in the OLE FD phase as 
well as the number of infections, serious infections, injection site related reactions and hepatic-related 
AEs. The incidence rates for AES in the BSA phase was comparable to the incidence rates for the 
overall treatment program for Humira for the JIA indication while the incidence rates for the FD phase 
was lower. The pattern of AEs in the two respective phases of the study does not cause any additional 
concern. 
The applicant presented an analysis of the TEAEs in the OLE BSA and OLE FD phases of Study DE038 
reported by subjects weighing 15 to < 30 kg as the applicant considers that this weight group is 
representative of the age group of 4 to 12 years of age who would be primarily affected by a dose 
change from a BSA-based dosing regimen to a FD regimen. There was no apparent increase in the 
frequency of AEs, serious AEs, infections, serious infections or injection site reactions in the FD phase 
compared to the BSA phase for these subjects. 
It is noted that more subjects reported injection site reactions in the group that increased their dose in 
the FD phase of study DE038 compared to the group that received the same/decreased dose in the FD 
phase compared to the BSA phase. It is however acknowledged that overall, these events were rather 
few. 
Overall, judging from the data presented above, the safety profile of the FD dosing appears more 
benign than the BSA dosing despite the fact that the vast majority of subjects either remained on the 
same dose (50/106 subjects) or had their dose increased (53/106) in the OLE FD phase compared to 
the OLE BSA phase. It should however be acknowledged that both subjects in the OLA BSA dosing 
phase and subjects in the OLE FD phase constituted very selected groups since the design of DE038 
meant that subject that did not benefit from adalimumab or did not tolerate adalimumab were 
excluded earlier on in the study. Of note, 44 of the 106 subjects (42%) that entered the FD phase did 
not complete this phase while 22 of 128 subjects (17%) that entered the BSA phase did not complete 
this phase. Although a variety of reasons for the discontinuations were given, it is reasonable to 
assume that it was the patients that did best on and tolerated the treatment remained in the study 
which affects the comparison of AEs between the two dosing regimens. 
Data from the pJIA study M10-240 
In the summary of clinical safety included in the current application, the presentation of data from 
M10-240 was focused on the eight subjects that received the 20 mg FD i.e. subjects <30 kg and the 
comparison with 53 weight-matched BSA-dosed subjects in DE038. The percentage of subjects that 
had any AEs were 87.5% in the FD-group of the M10-240 study and 86.8% in the BSA-based dosing 
group in the DE38 study, the frequency for serious AEs was 12.5% vs 9.4% and the frequency for 
infections were 50.0% vs 50.9%. There were no serious infections reported for this time period for the 
two groups. 
It is noted that according to the study report of M10-240, subjects weighing 30 kg or more were to be 
dosed with 40 mg of adalimumab eow which is also consistent with the proposed FD posology of this 
application. It is thus not clear why the focus in the presentation of data from M10-240 is entirely on 
the eight subjects <30 kg that received the 20 mg FD, discarding the safety data from rest of the 17 
subjects in the study. This safety data was thus retrieved from the study protocol of study M10-240. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 46/63 
 
 
 
 
total 25 Japanese pJIA subjects were included in study M10-240 and safety data up to week 60 was 
presented in the study report. Up to week 60, 25/25 subjects experienced any AE, 6/25 (24%) 
experienced any serious AE, 24 (96%) experienced any infection, 4 (16%) experienced any serious 
infectious AE, 6 (24%) experienced injection site reaction related AEs. Incidence rates (events/100 PY) 
were 655.9 for any AE, 22.3 for any serious AE, 275.3 for any infectious AE, 8.1 for any serious 
infectious AE, 16.2 for injection related AE. Thus overall, the incidence rates for AEs, SAEs, infections 
and serious infections are higher than the corresponding figures that was presented by the applicant 
for the overall treatment program for JIA. The reasons for this are not clear. However, as the study 
included only 25 subjects the conclusions that can be drawn from the safety data are limited. 
Data from pJIA registry study P10-262 
The applicant presented an overview of TEAEs reported as of 01 June 2015 by patients in post 
marketing registry Study P10-262 who received adalimumab dosing by either a BSA-based dosing 
regimen or a FD regimen as per local label. Incidence rates for any AE were 46.4/100 PYs for subjects 
dosed with FD regimen and 40.5/100 PYs for subjects dosed with BSA-based dosing while the 
corresponding figures for any serious AEs were 4.8/100 PYs and 10.7/100 PYs. 
The comparison between FD-dosing and BSA-dosing based on registry data has to be interpreted with 
caution due to its many limitations including the fact that two different geographic regions with 
possible differences in treatment praxis and proneness to report AEs were compared. It is also not 
explicitly stated that the FD dosing in US and Australia is identical (including identical bodyweight-cut 
offs) to the FD-dosing proposed in this application.  That being said, a rough assessment of total 
number of AEs, serious AEs, infections and serious infections for the whole population did not point at 
any clear safety advantage for any of the two dosing regimens. Also for the subgroup of patients 
weighing 15 kg to <30 kg, the safety profile for the two dosing-regimens appeared comparable. 
Data from JIA-associated uveitis study SYCAMORE 
The SYCAMORE study was a randomized, controlled Phase 3 study assessing the safety and 
effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with MTX for the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis. A 
total of 90 subjects were randomized to adalimumab (N = 60) or placebo (N = 30). Treatment was 
administered concomitantly as a FD regimen with a stable dose of MTX (10 mg/m2 up to a maximum 
dose of 25 mg). 
The overall incidence rate of AEs was for the adalimumab group 1007 events per 100 patient years 
[E/100 PYs]) and for the placebo group (651 E/100 PYs). The rate of SAEs was in the adalimumab 
group 29 E/100 PY and in the placebo group 19 E/100 PY. The most common AEs in the adalimumab 
group were classified as infections and infestations (76.7% in the adalimumab group, 40% in the 
placebo group), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (51.7% in the adalimumab group, 20% 
in the placebo group; most frequently reported events were cough and oropharyngeal pain), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (50% in the adalimumab group and 23.3% in the placebo 
group; including 33 events of pyrexia reported in 12 patients in the adalimumab arm) gastrointestinal 
disorders (43.3% in the adalimumab group and 26.7% in the placebo group; most frequent events 
were diarrhoea and vomiting), nervous system disorders (26.7% in the adalimumab group and 13.3% 
in the placebo group; including 21 events of headache in 12 adalimumab patients), musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (25% in the adalimumab group and 20% in the placebo group), 
investigations (25% in the adalimumab group, 10% in the placebo group), and eye disorders (23.3% 
in the adalimumab group and 26.7% in the placebo group). The 5 severe AEs in the adalimumab group 
were cataract, injection site reaction, tonsillitis, arthralgia and arthritis. The 3 severe AEs in the 
Assessment report

placebo group were anterior chamber flare (2 events in the same subject) and uveitis. No death were 
reported. The most frequently reported SAEs in the adalimumab group were infections. 
The safety results from the SYCAMORE Study is of interest as the study population is at least 
overlapping with the target population of this application and the dosing according to weight is 
identical to the proposed FD dosing in this application. Compared to the overall AE and SAE incidence 
rate from Humira JIA treatment program data, the SYCAMORE AE and SAE incidence rates in the 
Humira treatment group appear surprisingly high. It is acknowledged that also the incidence rate for 
AEs and SAEs were rather high also in the placebo group which could be interpreted as this specific 
population being more prone to develop AEs or be a reflection of the effectiveness of the AE reporting 
system in this trial. One reason for this population being more prone to develop AEs than the overall 
adalimumab treated population could be that in the SYCAMORE study adalimumab for all subjects was 
to be administered on top of Methotrexate which was not the case in the overall adalimumab 
programme. An explanation for a potentially increased proneness to report AEs in the SYCAMORE 
study compared to the overall programme could be that the SYCAMORE study was an investigator-
initiated study. 
The results from the SYCAMORE study have been reviewed in EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163 within which 
the study report was submitted.  The current application included a reference to the parallel uveitis 
procedure and the SYCAMORE study report. In this study the incidence rates of infections and serious 
infections were higher in the adalimumab arm of the SYCAMORE study than in previous adalimumab 
JIA studies. Some of the AEs that were not classified as infections could be related to infections; this 
concern for example cough, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, diarrhoea etc. However, the incidence rate of 
infections in the placebo arm in SYCAMORE was also comparable to the incidence rates of infections for 
adalimumab-treated subjects in previous JIA-studies strengthening the previous suspicion that the 
study population in SYCAMORE could consist of a population being more prone to develop AEs 
(including infections) or that the safety outcome could reflect the relative effectiveness of the AE 
reporting system in this trial.  
Serious adverse event and deaths 
As previously noted, exposure to the FD regimen derives from the open-label phase of the placebo-
controlled study DE038 in pJIA, the Japanese open label study M10-240 in pJIA, the post marketing 
observational registry study P10-262 in pJIA, the phase 3 double blind study M06-806 in CD, the open 
label study M06-807 in CD, the post marketing observational registry study P11-292 in CD and the 
placebo-controlled, double-masked study SYCAMORE in uveitis. In addition to these studies, data from 
other pedatric studies using different dosing regimens were also included and discussed in the present 
application. 
No deaths were reported in Studies DE038, M10-240, M10-444, P10-262, M11-328, M06-806, M06- 
807, P11-292 or SYCAMORE i.e. there were no deaths in the studies in which a FD-dosing was used.  
A summary of SAEs across paediatric indications were presented by the Applicant: 
• 
JIA: In the OLE phases of Study DE038, SAEs were more common for subjects receiving a BSA-
based dosing regimen than subjects receiving a FD regimen of adalimumab. For the subgroup of 
subjects weighing 15 to < 30 kg in the OLE of Study DE038, more subjects receiving a BSA-based 
dosing regimen of adalimumab reported SAEs than subjects receiving a FD of adalimumab (no 
subjects receiving a FD regimen reported. The rate of SAEs in Study P10-262 was higher in 
countries using a BSA-based dosing of adalimumab than in countries using a FD regimen 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 48/63 
 
 
 
 
•  CD: The applicant summarized the SAE data from the CD population (see more information in the 
clinical AR) 
•  Uveitis: In the SYCAMORE study, the rate of SAEs was in the adalimumab group (29 E/100 PY) and 
in the placebo group (19 E/100 PY). There were a total of 17 SAEs reports in the adalimumab 
group and 3 SAEs in the placebo group during the course of the trial. 
Judging from the pJIA data derived from study DE038 and P10-262 that the applicant have presented, 
SAEs do not occur more frequently with the FD dosing compared to BSA based dosing. However, the 
data presented need to be interpreted with caution due to several limitations. 
The applicant also summarized the SAE data from the CD population but this data have poor relevance 
for this procedure, primarily since the investigated posology and analysis conducted were not coherent 
with the focus of this variation. 
The safety results from the Uveitis SYCAMORE Study is of interest as the study population is at least 
overlapping with the target population of this application and the dosing according to weight is 
identical to the proposed FD dosing in this application. In this study, the incidence rate for SAEs was 
higher than in previous studies on similar populations. According to the SYCAMORE study report, there 
were a total of 17 SAEs reports in the adalimumab group and 3 SAEs in the placebo group during the 
course of the trial. Overall 13 (21.7%) and 2 (6.7%) of the patients in the adalimumab and placebo 
groups respectively, had at least one SAE. The SAEs reported in the 13 patients in the adalimumab 
group were varicella, streptococcal infection, diarrhoea, syncope (reported together with diarrhoea) 
viral infection, scarlet fever, cellulitis, infected bites, lower respiratory tract infection, cataract, testes 
exploration, antiviral prophylaxis, food poisoning, and tonsillar hypertrophy. The SAEs reported in the 
two patients in the placebo group were anterior chamber flare and uveitis. The most frequently 
reported SAEs in the adalimumab group were infections (10 events in 8 patients).  
As previously stated, specific clinical safety data concerning from the proposed FD dos regimen are 
lacking for the ERA and Ps indications, instead the safety assessment for these indications has to rely 
on the PK analysis and modelling and extrapolations from the other indications. Although probably 
acceptable given the similarities between the populations, this is still considered a limitation. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
JIA 
In Study DE038, no subjects discontinued study drug due to an AE from the OLE BSA phase, while 5 
subjects discontinued from the FD phase. Of the subjects who discontinued because of an AE, 4 
subjects had a dose decrease or their dose remained the same and 1 subject had a dose increase. 
Among the subgroup of subjects in Study DE038 weighing 15 kg to < 30 kg, no subjects discontinued 
due to an AE from the OLE BSA phase, while 2 subjects discontinued from the OLE FD phase. 
No subjects in Study M10-240 discontinued due to an AE. 
As of 01 June 2015, the rate of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug in Study P10-262 
(STRIVE) was according to the applicant slightly higher in countries using BSA-based dosing regimens 
of adalimumab than in countries using FD regimens of adalimumab (please see details in above 
sections of this AR). Among subjects weighing 15 kg to < 30 kg, only 1 subject receiving BSA-based 
dosing discontinued study drug.

In the SYCAMORE study, 9 subjects (15%) in the adalimumab group discontinued treatment 
prematurely during the course of the trial. 
Discontinuations due to AEs generally appeared quite rare independently of dosing regimens. 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Introduction 
This procedure concerns changes to a FD posology for the paediatric indications JIA, ERA (currently 
BSA-dependent posology) and Ps (currently BW-dependent posology). FD-dosing is proposed also for 
the new indication uveitis which has been evaluated in a parallel procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163). No changes are proposed in the paediatric indications for which a fixed-
dose posology is already applied (CD, HS). The changes are reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC for 
the new dose-strength 20 mg prefilled syringe,that is included as a line extension in this application, as 
well as the changes proposed in the SmPCs for the currently approved presentations. Furthermore the 
applicant proposes to add a statement on immunogenicity in JIA in section 5.1 of the SmPC referring 
to data from a previous procedure, this short addendum is accepted. 
The pharmacokinetic data and pharmacokinetic modelling are considered pivotal for the proposed FD-
regimen while the clinical efficacy and safety data is regarded as complementary. 
The safety data that the applicant refers to as support for the proposed FD regimens of adalimumab 
are from clinical trials and from a post-approval commitment to the FDA/PIP requirement of the EMA. 
These studies have been conducted in patients with pJIA (phase 3 studies DE038 and M10-240 
[Japan], post-marketing compassionate use study M10-444, and registry study P10-262 [STRIVE]), 
ERA (Study M11-328), paediatric Ps (Study M04-717), paediatric CD (Studies M06-806, M06-807, and 
P11-292 [CAPE]), and paediatric uveitis (the SYCAMORE study). Study reports have been previously 
submitted for these studies. A central scientific advice was given regarding the issue was received in 
June 2016 (EMA/SAWP/401051/2016). Some points were raised by the SAWP/CHMP and appear to 
have been generally addressed/ implemented. 
In the Summary of Safety submitted with this application, an overview of AEs in the treatment 
programs for Humira across indications was provided. The overall incidence rates of AEs for the 
adalimumab paediatric indications of JIA, Ps, and CD were reported to be 525.3 E/100 PYs, 518.5 
E/100 PYs, and 566.5 E/100 PYs, respectively. The overall incidence of SAEs were 13.5/100 PYs, 
7.4/100 PYs and 32.2 /100 PYs respectively. The overall incidence of infections were 150.7/100 PYs, 
168.7/100  PYs, 132.0/100 PYs respectively. The overall incidence of serious infection was 2.7/100 
PYs, 0.8/100 PYs, 6.6/100 PYs respectively. The overall incidence of injection site reactions were 
104.6/100 PYs, 14.0/100 PYs and 20.3/100 PYs. 
Exposure 
Exposure to the FD regimen derives from the open-label phase of the placebo-controlled study DE038 
in JIA, the Japanese open label study M10-240 in JIA, the post marketing observational registry study 
P10-262 in JIA, the phase 3 double blind study M06-806 in CD, the open label study M06-807 in CD, 
the post marketing observational registry study P11-292 in CD and the placebo-controlled, double-
masked study SYCAMORE in uveitis.  
In total, the number of subjects with exposure to Adalimumab Fixed Dose regimen was 727 and the 
number of subjects with ≥ 6 month’s exposure for this regimen was 524.

Safety data generated  in  JIA (study DE038) and uveitis (study SYCAMORE) are of primarily  relevance 
for the present application. Data from the other studies are considered supportive but of limited value 
due various reasons (small study population, dosing different  from the proposed FD dosing) . 
Additionally, comparisons between studies and between geographical regions are difficult to interpret. 
There are specific exposure and clinical safety data for the proposed FD-dose regimen for only two of 
the paediatric indtications, pJIA and uveitis, for which the applicant aims to introduce the new FD-
dosing regimen. The uveitis indication is the focus of a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163), 
but the current application included a cross reference to the SYCAMORE study report and the 
SYCAMORE study data does indeed provide some support also for the JIA indication as the populations 
overlap. There are no specific clinical safety data from FD-dosing for the ERA and the Ps population, 
instead the assessment is entirely dependent on the PK analysis and modelling and extrapolations from 
the other indications. This is acceptable given the similarities of the populations but still a limitation. 
Data from pJIA study DE038 
DE038 (Art46), the study was a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, DB, stratified, parallel-group study 
in children (4 to 17 years old) with pJIA that were either treated or not treated with MTX. A side-by-
side comparison of the exposure-adjusted rates for subjects in the OLE BSA and OLE FD phases of 
Study DE038 who received at least 1 dose of OLE FD study drug were presented by the applicant. The 
incidence rates for any AEs was 512.4/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 287.6/100 PYs in the FD phase. 
Incidence rates for serious AEs was 12.6/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 8.2/100 PYs in the FD phase. 
Incidence rates for infections was 146.4/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 99.4/100 PYs in the FD phase. 
Incidence rates for serious infections was 2.5/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 0.7 in the FD phase. The 
incidence rates for total number of AEs were thus lower during the OLE FD phase compared to the OLE 
BSA phase in study DE038. The incidence rates for serious AEs was also lower in the OLE FD phase as 
well as the number of infections, serious infections, injection site related reactions and hepatic-related 
AEs. The incidence rates for AES in the BSA phase was comparable to the incidence rates for the 
overall treatment program for Humira for the JIA indication while the incidence rates for the FD phase 
was lower. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in both study phases were upper respiratory tract infection and 
viral infections. Injection site reactions and injection site pain was more frequent in the OLE BSA 
dosing phase than in the OLE FD dosing phase while symptoms from the joints (lack of efficacy?) 
appeared to be somewhat more frequent in the OLE FD phase. No deaths were reported. 
The applicant presented an analysis of the TEAEs in the OLE BSA and OLE FD phases of Study DE038 
reported by subjects weighing 15 to < 30 kg as the applicant considers that this weight group is 
representative of the age group of 4 to 12 years of age who would be primarily affected by a dose 
change from a BSA-based dosing regimen to a FD regimen. There was no apparent increase in the 
frequency of AEs, serious AEs, infections, serious infections or injection site reactions in the FD phase 
compared to the BSA phase for these subjects. 
It is noted that more subjects reported injection site reactions in the group that increased their dose in 
the FD phase of study DE038 compared to the group that received the same/decreased dose in the FD 
phase compared to the BSA phase. However, overall, these events were rather few and the 
conclusions that can be drawn from this data are limited. 
Overall, judging from the data presented above, the safety profile of the FD dosing appears more 
benign than the BSA dosing despite the fact that the vast majority of subjects either remained on the 
same dose (50/106 subjects) or had their dose increased (53/106) in the OLE FD phase compared to 
the OLE BSA phase.  However, it has to be acknowledged that both subjects in the OLA BSA dosing 
phase and subjects in the OLE FD phase constituted very selected groups since the design of DE038 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 51/63 
 
 
 
 
meant that subject that did not benefit from adalimumab or did not tolerate adalimumab were 
excluded earlier on in the study. Of note, 44 of the 106 subjects (42%) that entered the FD phase did 
not complete this phase while 22 of 128 subjects (17%) that entered the BSA phase did not complete 
this phase. Although a variety of reasons for the discontinuations were given, it is reasonable to 
assume that it was the subjects that did best on the treatment that remained in the study which 
affects the comparison of AEs between the two dosing regimens. 
Twenty-seven subjects (27/171, 15.8%) with JIA had at least 1 anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA)-
positive on treatment sample during the OL and DB phases of the study DE-038 where BSA-based 
dosing was administered. For the 56 subjects included in the PK analyses from the OLE FD phase, 12 
subjects (12/56, 21.4%) were identified with at least 1 AAA-positive result on treatment sample during 
Study DE038. None of the subjects developed AAA after the switch to a FD. 
Data from the pJIA study M10-240 
In the summary of clinical safety included in the current application, the presentation of data from 
M10-240 was focused on the eight subjects that received the 20 mg FD i.e. subjects <30 kg and the 
comparison with the weight-matched BSA-dosed subjects in DE038. The conclusions that can be drawn 
from the inter study-comparison presented by the applicant are very limited. It is noted that according 
to the study report of M10-240, subjects weighing 30 kg or more were to be dosed with 40 mg of 
adalimumab eow which is also consistent with the proposed FD posology of this application. It is thus 
not clear why the focus in the presentation of data from M10-240 is entirely on the eight subjects <30 
kg that received the 20 mg FD, discarding the safety data from rest of the 17 subjects in the study. 
This safety data was thus retrieved from the study protocol of study M10-240. In total 25 Japanese 
pJIA subjects were included in study M10-240 and safety data up to week 60 was presented in the 
study report. Overall, the incidence rates for AEs, SAEs, infections and serious infections are higher 
than the corresponding figures that were presented by the applicant for the overall treatment program 
for JIA. The reasons for this are not clear. However, as the study included only 25 subjects, the 
conclusion that can be drawn from the safety data it generated is limited. 
Data from pJIA registry study P10-262 
The comparison between FD-dosing and BSA-dosing based on registry data has to be interpreted with 
caution due to its many limitations including the fact that two different geographic regions with 
possible differences in treatment praxis and proneness to report AEs were compared. It is also not 
explicitly stated that the FD dosing in US and Australia is identical (including identical bodyweight-cut 
offs) to the FD-dosing proposed in this application. That being said, a rough assessment of total 
number of AEs, serious AEs, infections and serious infections for the whole population did not point at 
any clear safety advantage for any of the two dosing regimens. Also for the subgroup of patients 
weighing 15 kg to <30 kg, the safety profile for the two dosing-regimens appeared was comparable.  
Data from JIA-associated uveitis study SYCAMORE 
The overall incidence rate of AEs was for the adalimumab group 1007 events per 100 patient years 
[E/100 PYs]) and for the placebo group (651 E/100 PYs). The rate of SAEs was in the adalimumab 
group 29 E/100 PY and in the placebo group 19 E/100 PY. The most common AEs in the adalimumab 
group were classified as infections and infestations (76.7% in the adalimumab group, 40% in the 
placebo group), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (51.7% in the adalimumab group, 20% 
in the placebo group; most frequently reported events were cough and oropharyngeal pain), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (50% in the adalimumab group and 23.3% in the placebo 
group; including 33 events of pyrexia reported in 12 patients in the adalimumab arm) gastrointestinal 
disorders (43.3% in the adalimumab group and 26.7% in the placebo group; most frequent events 
were diarrhoea and vomiting), nervous system disorders (26.7% in the adalimumab group and 13.3% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 52/63 
 
 
 
 
in the placebo group; including 21 events of headache in 12 adalimumab patients), musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (25% in the adalimumab group and 20% in the placebo group), 
investigations (25% in the adalimumab group, 10% in the placebo group), and eye disorders (23.3% 
in the adalimumab group and 26.7% in the placebo group). The 5 severe AEs in the adalimumab group 
were cataract, injection site reaction, tonsillitis, arthralgia and arthritis. The 3 severe AEs in the 
placebo group were anterior chamber flare (2 events in the same subject) and uveitis. No deaths were 
reported. The most frequently reported SAEs in the adalimumab group were infections. 
The safety results from the SYCAMORE Study is of interest as the study population is at least 
overlapping with the target population of this application and the dosing according to weight is 
identical to the proposed FD dosing in this application. Compared to the overall AE and SAE incidence 
rate from Humira JIA treatment program data, the SYCAMORE AE and SAE incidence rates in the 
Humira treatment group appear surprisingly high. It is acknowledged that also the incidence rate for 
AEs and SAEs were rather high also in the placebo group which could be interpreted as this specific 
population being more prone to develop AEs or be a reflection of the effectiveness of the AE reporting 
system in this trial. One reason for this population being more prone to develop AEs than the overall 
adalimumab treated population could be that in the SYCAMORE study, adalimumab for all subjects was 
to be administered on top of Methotrexate which was not the case in the overall adalimumab program. 
An explanation for a potentially increased proneness to report AEs in the SYCAMORE study compared 
to the overall program could be that the SYCAMORE study was an investigator-initiated study.” The 
SYCAMORE study is currently under review in EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163 within which the study report 
was submitted.  According to the response to the first round of questions in 
EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163, also the incidence rates of infections and serious infections were higher in 
the adalimumab arm of the SYCAMORE study than in previous adalimumab JIA studies. Some of the 
AEs that were not classified as infections could in fact still be related to infections; this concern for 
example cough, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, diarrhoea etc. However, the incidence rate of infections 
in the placebo arm in SYCAMORE was comparable to the incidence rates of infections for adalimumab-
treated subjects in previous JIA-studies strengthening the previous suspicion that the study population 
in SYCAMORE could consist of a population being more prone to develop AEs (including infections) or 
that the safety outcome could reflect the relative effectiveness of the AE reporting system in this trial.  
Issues relating to the FD regimen across studies 
Given that the pharmacokinetic analysis/modelling indicate that exposure will be somewhat higher with 
the proposed FD dosing compared with previous dosing regimens in particularly subjects with BW<15 
kg, the applicant was encouraged provide a summary of the safety profile (i.e. the total number of 
AEs, serious AEs, infections, serious infections and injection site related AEs) in the different studies in 
which the proposed FD dosing was applied.  
The applicant responded that among the studies presented across the indications of JIA, pediatric CD, 
and pediatric Ps, there were no subjects weighing < 15 kg who received a FD regimen of 20 mg.  Only 
1 study, Study P10-262 (STRIVE), reported subjects with a body weight < 15 kg and a FD regimen; 
however, these subjects received a 10 mg dose of adalimumab consistent with the local label (United 
States). Clinical safety data from subjects from this study and from within the same country, who 
weighed ≥  15 kg but < 17.5 kg and thus did receive a 20 mg FD regimen were presented. The 
applicant concluded that for subjects who received adalimumab 20 mg FD and weighing 15 kg to  < 
17.5 kg at baseline, a similar safety profile was observed compared to subjects weighing < 15 kg who 
received adalimumab 10 mg FD. The applicant also argues that these results are consistent with the 
safety profile for the overall patient population in the registry.  
Thus, the data requested is not available. However, the arguments put forward by the applicant why 
the slightly higher exposure under the FD regimen for subjects < 15 kg does not create any safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 53/63 
 
 
 
 
 
issues and, thus, are supportive of the modelling/simulation results are acknowledged. Moreover, as 
concluded in the CHMP AR for the paediatric Uveitis variation EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163 with CHMP 
opinion adopted in July 2017, the exposure-safety analyses did not reveal an increase in the incidence 
of AEs with raised exposure levels within the analysed concentration range which included 
concentrations larger than the simulated range in paediatric uveitis patients <15 kg.  
2.7.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Given that transition from BSA-dosing to the proposed FD-dosing in the pJIA study DE038 for most 
subjects meant that they would either remain on the same dose (50/106 subjects) or have their dose 
increased (53/106) and that the pharmacokinetic analysis/modelling, which is considered pivotal for 
this application,  indicates that exposure will be higher rather than lower with the proposed FD dosing 
compared with previous dosing regimen, analysis of the clinical safety data is of interest.  
It is reassuring that the pharmacokinetic analyses appear to indicate that the differences in exposure 
for the proposed FD-posology are not large compared to the approved dosing for the indications of 
interest and that the exposure-safety data does not demonstrate a clear relationship between 
exposure and AEs.  
In the light of the totality of data submitted by the applicant and the benefits associated with a fixed 
dose regimen that is consistent across indications, the posology proposed by the applicant is thus 
accepted. 
There are no findings among the clinical safety data that would warrant changes to the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This procedure concerns changes to a FD posology for the paediatric indications JIA, ERA (currently 
BSA-dependent posology) and Ps (currently BW-dependent posology). FD is proposed also for the new 
indication uveitis which has been evaluated in a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163). No 
changes are proposed in the paediatric indications for which a fixed-dose posology is already applied 
(CD, HS). The changes are reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC for the new dose-strength 20 mg 
prefilled syringe; that is included as a line extension in this application, as well as the changes 
proposed in the SmPCs for the currently approved presentations. Furthermore the applicant proposes 
to add a statement on immunogenicity in JIA in section 5.1 of the SmPC referring to data from a 
previous procedure. 
JIA is an autoimmune disease with a complex genetic predisposition that has been observed in children 
under the age of 16 years. It is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood and an important 
cause of disability in children. The onset of JIA is characterized by 3 primary modes: 
Oligoarthritis/pauciarticular arthritis (< 5 joints) is most common, occurring in 50% of patients, 
followed by polyarticular (≥  5 joints) in 30% of patients, and systemic arthritis (at least one joint with 
fever and rash) in 10% to 20% of patients.  
Ps is a chronic immunologic disease in infants, children, adolescents, and adults, that is characterized 
by marked inflammation and thickening of the epidermis, resulting in thick, scaly plaques on the skin. 
It affects 1% to 3% of the general population.  
The aim of therapy for these conditions is both to prevent symptomatic relief and to modify the 
underlying disease and thereby prevent joint destruction and disabilities (JIA). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For JIA, NSAIDs are the usual first-line treatment, since they are considered to be the least toxic agent 
in children. They provide symptomatic relief, but are not considered to be disease-modifying. 
Methotrexate (MTX) is considered to have an acceptable level of toxicity relative to its efficacy; most 
children demonstrate at least some response to MTX therapy, although remission is rare. Other types 
of traditional medications commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults are less 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 55/63 
 
 
 
 
 
preferable for use in paediatric subjects. Five biologic agents are approved for the treatment of pJIA: 
adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, abatacept and tocilizumab. 
For paediatric Ps, treatment options are similar, but more limited than treatment options for adults. 
The most commonly used topical therapies in children include corticosteroids, steroid-sparing agents 
like calcipotriol and tazarotene, salicylic acid, tar, and anthralin. Regular use of emollients can be 
applied in mild Ps. Particularly effective is tar and anthralin when prescribed in combination with 
ultraviolet B (UVB) light. The calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are currently under 
investigation for Ps and are indicated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Systemic nonbiologic 
treatments, such as retinoid acitretin, cyclosporine A, methotrexate (MTX) and dapsone, are described 
in the literature and are used when patients are not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy. 
These treatments are also used for rare forms of Ps, such as pustular Ps and erythrodermic Ps in 
children. Four biologic agents are currently approved for adult patients with moderate to severe Ps. 
These include the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists adalimumab, etanercept and 
infliximab and the IL 12/23 antagonist, ustekinumab. In addition, the TNF-α antagonist, golimumab, is 
approved for PsA. 
The rationale behind the proposed the switch from the BSA/BW-dependent Humira paediatric posology 
to the FD-posology is to provide a simplified and more convenient use by the patient, physician, and 
caregiver. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of adalimumab are well characterized in paediatric 
subjects in the approved indications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; specifically the categories of 
polyarticular JIA [pJIA] and enthesitis-related arthritis [ERA]), paediatric psoriasis (Ps), and paediatric 
Crohn's disease (CD).  These data were provided in previous submissions. 
The proposed FD regimen is supported by population PK modelling and exposure response analyses 
evaluating multiple potential FD regimens with BW cutoffs for adalimumab in paediatric subjects with 
JIA (pJIA and ERA) and paediatric Ps.  PK simulations were conducted using a population PK model 
that was developed previously based on adalimumab concentration data across different paediatric 
indications in order to evaluate adalimumab PK across the paediatric age range and across the 
different disease populations.  Exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety were conducted in 
order to assess the potential clinical impact of PK differences associated with the FD regimens 
compared to current dosing based on BSA or BW for JIA and paediatric Ps, respectively. 
A summary of paediatric studies is listed in Table 12.

Clinical Efficacy 
For JIA, four studies have been presented to support the variation (as described in 2.3). These are 
performed in patients with pJIA (DE038, M10-240 and M10-444) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA, 
study M11-328). For psoriasis, data are available from a study in paediatric plaque psoriasis (M04-
717). The main clinical study to support this variation is DE038, where subjects treated with 
adalimumab in a BSA-based dose were transitioned to a FD, and change in PedACR 30/50/70/90 were 
compared between patients receiving a lowered/unchanged dose versus patients receiving a higher 
dose. Data from the other studies are of limited interest for this variation, due to usage of other dosing 
regimens than the proposed or inclusion of a low number of patients. 
Clinical Safety 
The safety data that the applicant refers to as support for the proposed FD regimens of adalimumab 
are from clinical trials and from a post-approval commitment to the FDA/PIP requirement of the EMA. 
Study reports have been previously submitted for these studies. Exposure to the FD regimen derives 
from the open-label phase of the placebo-controlled study DE038 in JIA, the Japanese open label study 
M10-240 in JIA, the post marketing observational registry study P10-262 in JIA, the phase 3 double 
blind study M06-806 in CD, the open label study M06-807 in CD, the post marketing observational 
registry study P11-292 in CD and the placebo-controlled, double masked study SYCAMORE in uveitis. 
Relevant safety data for the present application stem primarily from JIA study DE038 and uveitis study 
SYCAMORE. Data from the other mentioned studies are considered supportive but of limited value due 
various reasons.  
In total, the number of subjects with exposure to adalimumab FD-regimen was 727 and the number of 
subjects with ≥ 6 month’s exposure for this regimen was 524. 
Of note, there are specific exposure and clinical safety data for the proposed FD-dose regimen for only 
two of the paediatric indications, pJIA and uveitis, for which the applicant aims to introduce the new 
dosing regimen. The uveitis indication is the focus of a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163 ) 
but the SYCAMORE safety data provide some support also for the JIA indication as the populations 
overlap. There are no specific clinical safety data from FD-dosing for the ERA and the Ps population, 
instead the assessment is entirely dependent on the PK analysis and modelling and extrapolations from 
the other indications. This is probably acceptable given the similarities of the populations but still a 
limitation.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Of the 106 subjects enrolled in the open-label fixed-dose extension of study DE038, only 3 subjects 
received a lower dose with the FD regime compared to BSA based dosing. 50 subjects maintained the 
same dose and 53 got an increased dose. When comparing outcome measures (pedACR30/50/70/90) 
between individuals with same/decreased dose versus increased dose, no statistically significant 
differences were seen in pedACR30/50/70. For pedACR90, there was a difference at Week 12 visit for 
patients comparing patients with an increased dose vs patients with decreased dose (66.7% vs 0%, 
p=0.03). Patients with maintained dose were not included in this analysis. When performing stratified 
analysis per age category, there were some differences. At Week 32 and at the Final visit, a greater 
proportion of subjects aged 9 to 12 years with increased doses were PedACR70 responders (100% at 
Week 32 and 95.7% at final visit) compared to subjects with the same/decreased doses (62.5% at 
Week 32 and 55.6 at final visit, p=0.014-0.015). At Week 48 and 96, a greater proportion of subjects 
aged 9 to 12 years with increased doses were PedACR90 responders (90.5 at Week 48 and Week 96) 
compared to subjects with the same/decreased doses (55.6% at Week 48 and 42.9% at Week 96, 
p=0.049/0.021).  
Furthermore, all evaluated exposure-efficacy relationships display a general trend that increasing 
adalimumab concentrations lead to a beneficial response. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In study DE038, 44 of the 106 subjects (42%) that entered the FD phase did not complete this phase 
while 22 of 128 subjects (17%) that entered the BSA phase did not complete this phase. Also, all 
patients enrolled in the OLE were primarily adalimumab responders. 
Since a substantial proportion of subjects discontinued the study for various reasons, the number of 
subjects analysed at the latter visits are few .  
There are no specific clinical efficacy data from FD-dosing for the ERA and the Ps population, instead 
the assessment is dependent on the PK analysis and modelling and extrapolations from the other 
indications. 
However, the totality of data with the pharmacokinetic analysis/modelling in mind, it is considered that 
the current level of knowledge about the favourable effects is sufficient for a positive benefit-risk 
evaluation. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Given that transition from BSA-dosing to the proposed FD-dosing in the pJIA study DE038 for most 
subjects meant that they would either remain on the same dose (50/106 subjects) or have their dose 
increased (53/106) and that the pharmacokinetic analysis/modelling indicate that exposure will be 
higher rather than lower with the proposed FD dosing compared with previous dosing regimens; 
especially in subjects with BW<15 kg (see section 2 of this AR), analysis of the clinical safety data is of 
interest. 
In the Summary of Safety submitted with this application, an overview of AEs in the treatment 
programs for Humira across indications was provided. The overall incidence rates of AEs for the 
adalimumab paediatric indications of JIA, Ps, and CD were reported to be 525.3 E/100 PYs, 518.5 
E/100 PYs, and 566.5 E/100 PYs, respectively. The overall incidence of SAEs were 13.5/100 PYs, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 58/63 
 
 
 
 
 
7.4/100 PYs and 32.2 /100 PYs respectively. The overall incidence of infections were 150.7/100 PYs, 
168.7/100  PYs, 132.0/100 PYs respectively. The overall incidence of serious infection was 2.7/100 
PYs, 0.8/100 PYs, 6.6/100 PYs respectively. 
A side-by-side comparison of the exposure-adjusted rates for subjects in the OLE BSA and OLE FD 
phases of Study DE038 who received at least 1 dose of OLE FD study drug were presented by the 
applicant. The incidence rates for any AEs was 512.4/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 287.6/100 PYs in 
the FD phase. Incidence rates for serious AEs was 12.6/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 8.2/100 PYs in 
the FD phase. Incidence rates for infections was 146.4/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 99.4/100 PYs in 
the FD phase. Incidence rates for serious infections was 2.5/100 PYs in the BSA phase and 0.7 in the 
FD phase. The most frequently reported TEAEs in both study phases were upper respiratory tract 
infection and viral infections. Injection site reactions and injection site pain was more frequent in the 
OLE BSA dosing phase than in the OLE FD dosing phase. No deaths were reported. 
In the SYCAMORE study, in which the dosing according to weight was identical to the proposed FD 
dosing in this application, the overall incidence rate of AEs was for the adalimumab group 1007 events 
per 100 patient years [E/100 PYs]) and for the placebo group 651 E/100 PYs. The rate of SAEs was in 
the adalimumab group 29 E/100 PY and in the placebo group 19 E/100 PY. The most common AEs in 
the adalimumab group were classified as infections and infestations (76.7% in the adalimumab group, 
40% in the placebo group), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (51.7% in the adalimumab 
group, 20% in the placebo group; most frequently reported events were cough and oropharyngeal 
pain), general disorders and administration site conditions (50% in the adalimumab group and 23.3% 
in the placebo group; including 33 events of pyrexia reported in 12 patients in the adalimumab arm) 
gastrointestinal disorders (43.3% in the adalimumab group and 26.7% in the placebo group; most 
frequent events were diarrhoea and vomiting), nervous system disorders (26.7% in the adalimumab 
group and 13.3% in the placebo group; including 21 events of headache in 12 adalimumab patients), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25% in the adalimumab group and 20% in the 
placebo group), investigations (25% in the adalimumab group, 10% in the placebo group), and eye 
disorders (23.3% in the adalimumab group and 26.7% in the placebo group). The 5 severe AEs in the 
adalimumab group were cataract, injection site reaction, tonsillitis, arthralgia and arthritis. The 3 
severe AEs in the placebo group were anterior chamber flare (2 events in the same subject) and 
uveitis. No deaths were reported. The most frequently reported SAEs in the adalimumab group were 
infections. 
There were generally few discontinuations due to AEs independently of dosing regimens. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties 
Across the indications of JIA, pediatric CD, and pediatric Ps, there were no subjects weighing < 15 kg 
who received a FD regimen of 20 mg.  Only 1 study, Study P10-262 (STRIVE), reported subjects with a 
body weight < 15 kg and a FD regimen; however, these subjects received a 10 mg dose of 
adalimumab consistent with the local label. Clinical safety data from subjects from this study and from 
within the same country, who weighed ≥  15 kg but < 17.5 kg and thus did receive a 20 mg FD 
regimen were presented. The applicant concluded that for subjects who received adalimumab 20 mg 
FD and weighing 15 kg to  < 17.5 kg at Baseline, a similar safety profile was observed compared to 
subjects weighing < 15 kg who received adalimumab 10 mg FD. The applicant also argues that these 
results are consistent with the safety profile for the overall patient population in the registry. The 
arguments put forward by the applicant why the slightly higher exposure under the FD regimen for 
subjects < 15 kg does not create any safety issues and, thus, are supportive of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 59/63 
 
 
 
 
modelling/simulation results are acknowledged. Moreover, as concluded in the CHMP AR for the 
paediatric Uveitis variation EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163 with CHMP opinion adopted in July 2017, the 
exposure-safety analyses did not reveal an increase in the incidence of AEs with raised exposure levels 
within the analysed concentration range which included concentrations larger than the simulated range 
in paediatric uveitis patients <15 kg. 
Limitations 
As stated for the favourable effects, there are no specific clinical safety data from FD-dosing for the 
ERA and the Ps population, instead the assessment is dependent on the PK analysis and modelling and 
extrapolations from the other indications. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A previously developed paediatric population PK model based on adalimumab in several indications and 
subsequent simulations have been used for evaluating a potential fixed-dose regimen in paediatric 
patients across indications. Appropriate methods have been used for model development and 
simulations, and adequate exposure predictions have been produced to compare exposure ranges 
between the FD regimen and the approved dose regimens.  
Some deviations between the FD regimen of 20/40 mg (30 kg cut-off) and the previous body size 
adjusted dosing regimens are present, with an overall trend of slightly higher concentrations with the 
new dosing regimen. The largest deviations are seen in children <15 kg (<20kg for Ps patients), and in 
patients with a body weight of 30-40 kg. However, the presented exposure-efficacy analyses display 
clear exposure-response relationships where the effect increases with increasing exposure. 
Furthermore, the graphical analysis of exposure-safety relationships indicates that there is no trend 
between exposure and adverse events.  
The efficacy data obtained from study DE038 demonstrate overall maintained PEDACR30/50/70 
responses when shifting from BSA based dose to FD. When stratifying for age, there are some 
differences at individual visits for PEDACR70/90 responses indicating the effect with a FD might be 
lower in individuals aged 9-12 compared to a BSA based dose.  However, the numbers were small in 
the analysed groups and since only 3 subjects actually received a lower dose, it is not expected that 
this variation will overall have a negative impact on clinical efficacy and the advantage with a more 
uniform posology is endorsed. 
Relevant safety data for the present application stem primarily from pJIA study DE038 and uveitis 
study SYCAMORE. The uveitis indication is the focus of a parallel procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0163) but the SYCAMORE safety data provide some support for the JIA 
indication as the populations overlap and the dosing according to weight is identical to the proposed FD 
dosing in this application. There are no specific clinical safety data from FD-dosing for the ERA and the 
Ps population, instead the assessments pertaining to these indications are dependent on the PK 
analysis and modelling and extrapolations from the other indications.  
Judging from the pJIA DE038 data, the safety profile of the FD dosing appears overall more benign 
than the BSA dosing despite the fact that the vast majority of subjects either remained on the same 
dose (50/106 subjects) or had their dose increased (53/106) in the OLE FD phase compared to the 
OLE BSA phase. It should however be acknowledged that both subjects in the OLA BSA dosing phase 
and subjects in the OLE FD phase constituted very selected groups since the design of DE038 meant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 60/63 
 
 
 
 
that subject that did not benefit from adalimumab or did not tolerate adalimumab were excluded 
earlier on in the study.  
Regarding uveitis SYCAMORE study, the AE and SAE incidence rates in the Humira treatment group 
were higher than the overall AE and SAE incidence rates in the Humira JIA treatment program data. It 
is however acknowledged that also the incidence rate for AEs and SAEs in the placebo group of 
SYCAMORE were rather high, which could be interpreted as the SYCAMORE study population being 
more prone to develop AEs or be a reflection of the effectiveness of the AE reporting system in this 
trial.  
The FD dosing can be considered simplified and more convenient, being a positive contribution to 
patient care.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The new proposed FD-dosing appears to translate into a slightly higher dosing and exposure, especially 
for subjects with BW<15 kg. Given this knowledge, efficacy is expected to be maintained or even 
improved. The benefit with a posology that is more uniform across indications and simplified for health 
providers/patients is acknowledged. Regarding risks, the totality of data indicates that the safety 
profile can be expected to be similar with the new proposed FD-dosing compared to the currently 
approved. The Benefit risk is regarded as positive. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Humira is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Humira 20 mg is favourable in the following indication: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Humira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case 
of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for 
the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 
years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age 
and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy 
(see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/622609/2017  
Page 61/63 
 
 
 
 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents 
from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for 
topical therapy and phototherapies. 
Paediatric Crohn's disease  
Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or 
have contraindications for such therapies. 
Paediatric Uveitis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients 
from 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, 
or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) 
of the marketing authorisation for Humira.

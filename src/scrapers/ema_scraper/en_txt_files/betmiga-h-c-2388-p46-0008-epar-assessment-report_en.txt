1.  Introduction 
On March 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Betmiga (mirabegron), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Betmiga (mirabegron) was approved in adults for the symptomatic treatment of urgency, increased 
micturition frequency and/or urgency incontinence as may occur in patients with overactive bladder 
(OAB) syndrome in EU in 20th December 2012. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) has been agreed with the EMA for the development of mirabegron 
for the treatment of OAB and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in the pediatric population. The 
following reference numbers apply to the latest agreed PIP:  
• 
For OAB: 
o  EMA PIP number: EMEA-000597-PIP02-10-M05 
o  EMA Decision Number: P/0287/2016, dated 04 Nov 2016 
• 
For NDO: 
o  EMA PIP number: EMEA-000597-PIP03-15-M03 
o  PDCO Opinion at Day 60: EMA/PDCO/737452/2016, dated 27 Jan 2017 
The PIPs are agreed to be completed by March 2024. 
This document provides a critical assessment of the results of Study 178-CL-203. 
The pediatric development program for mirabegron in the treatment of NDO and OAB includes the 
following 4 completed phase 1 studies, in addition to phase 3 studies that are yet to be 
started/completed: 
1.  A relative bioavailability study in healthy young male and female adults (18 years to< 26 years) 
to compare the tablet and suspension formulation (2 mg/mL) when dosed under fasting and 
fed conditions (Study 178-CL-201) 
2.  A single ascending-dose study using tablets (Study 178-CL-202) in children and adolescents 
with NDO or OAB (5 years to < 18 years). 
3.  This single dose study in children with NDO or OAB (3 years to < 12 years) with the oral 
suspension of 2 mg/mL (Study 178-CL-203) 
4.  A single-dose relative bioavailability study in healthy adult subjects to compare the 2 mg/mL 
and 8 mg/mL oral suspension formulations, including assessment of the effect of food on the 
pharmacokinetics of the 8 mg/mL oral suspension (Study178-CL-208).  
The results of the above mentioned studies will be used to determine the doses for future studies in 
the pediatric population. 
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 3/25 
 
 
 
The results from Study 178-CL-201 demonstrated that the relative oral bioavailability of the oral 
suspension was approximately 2-fold lower than that of the tablet and showed that single doses of 50 
mg mirabegron oral suspension under fed and fasted conditions in healthy young male and female 
subjects were generally considered safe and well tolerated. 
In Study 178-CL-202, prolonged-release mirabegron tablets were investigated in a pediatric population 
for the first time. The single low and high doses were predicted to result in exposure levels comparable 
to the exposure in adults at steady state following 25 mg and 50 mg mirabegron once daily, 
respectively. The results showed that mirabegron exposures and pharmacokinetic parameters were in 
line with dose, age and food state in each cohort (5 cohorts: low dose adolescents fed condition, low 
dose children fed condition, high dose adolescents fed condition, high dose children fed condition, high 
dose children fasted condition). The single dose administration in this study was sufficient to reach 
similar exposure to that in adults at steady state. Based on the available data, mirabegron had an 
acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated at single doses of up to 75 mg in adolescents and 
children with OAB and NDO. 
Assessor´s comment  
EMEA-C2-000597-PIP03-15-M03 compliance report was discussed at the 16-19 May (2017) PDCO 
meeting. Feedback from the applicant has been requested in relation to the use of descriptive reporting 
of mirabegron PK in studies 178-CL-202 and 178-CL-203 as population pharmacokinetics was agreed 
to be used with the Committee. 
No multiple-dose phase I study for evaluating steady state concentrations in the paediatric population 
has been planned/informed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Mirabegron 2 mg/ml prolonged-release granules for oral suspension was used in the Study 178-CL-203.  
Oral suspensions have been developed for those pediatric patients who cannot be dosed with tablets. 
To obtain more acceptable volumes of dosing compared to the 2 mg/mL oral suspension, a 4-fold 
higher strength oral suspension (8 mg/mL) was developed. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for Study 178-CL-203. This study is included in the paediatric clinical 
development program as detailed in agreed PIPs (EMEA-000597-PIP02-10-M04; EMEA-000597 -PIP03 
-15-M01).The data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance of mirabegron and therefore 
does not have further regulatory consequences. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study: Study 178-CL-203 
A Multicentre, Open-label, Single Dose, Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and 
Tolerability of Mirabegron Oral Suspension in Pediatric Subjects from 3 to Less than 12 Years of Age 
with Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) or Overactive Bladder (OAB) 
EMA/753154/2017

Description 
The study explored the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, acceptability and palatability of 
mirabegron prolonged-release granules for oral suspension following a single dose targeted to obtain 
comparable exposure to once-daily 50 mg of mirabegron prolonged-release tablets at steady state, 
when administered to adults under undefined food conditions. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron oral suspension after single dose 
administration in children with NDO or OAB 
Secondary:  
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of mirabegron oral suspension after single dose 
administration in children with NDO or OAB 
To evaluate the palatability and acceptability of mirabegron oral suspension after single dose 
administration in children with NDO or OAB 
Assessor´s comment  
Single doses of prolonged-release granules for oral suspension (2 mg/ml) will be administered to 
children aged 3 years and above. Doses will be adjusted by body weight and targeted to obtain 
exposure levels comparable to 50 mg prolonged-release tablets at steady state in adults. The PK, 
safety, tolerability, palatability and acceptability will be studied.  
Study design 
This was a multicenter, open-label, single-dose study in the children with NDO from 3 to less than 12 
years of age and in children with OAB from 5 to less than 12 years of age. Nine male and female 
children were enrolled in the study, including 6 NDO and 3 OAB subjects.  
Informed consent and screening took place maximally 28 days prior to dosing. When eligibility of the 
subject was confirmed, washout of prohibited medication, if applicable, started. After washout, a 24-h 
heart rate assessment (24-h Holter) was done – hereafter referred to as reference day. If no washout 
was required, the screening visit and the reference day for the 24-h Holter could be combined. The 
reference day was scheduled 1 to 4 days prior to dosing (day -4 to -1). 
In the morning of day 1, all subjects were admitted to the clinic in fasting condition (last meal intake 
before midnight). Subjects had a light breakfast, their eligibility check was performed and if eligible, a 
blood sample for safety labs was drawn if necessary. Subjects were dosed within 1 h after completion 
of the light breakfast and were allowed to have a light lunch not sooner than 2 h after dosing.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling was initially performed on day 1, and during follow-up 3 pharmacokinetic 
samples were taken according to the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme (1 sample on day 2 and 1 
sample in 2 of the following intervals: day 3 [48-56 h], day 4 [72-80 h], day 5 [96-104 h], day 6 [120-
128 h], day 7 [144-152 h]). The visit for taking the last pharmacokinetic sample (day 4 to 7) was also 
used to conduct the end of study (EoS) assessments for that subject.

The screening, the day 1, and the day 4 to 7 visits had to be performed at the clinic. Visit details and 
any potential changes in the subject’s condition and/or concomitant medication were recorded in the 
source records and sent to the investigator by the qualified home healthcare service. 
Rescreening was not permitted.

End of study (EoS) was defined as the subject’s last protocol-defined assessment.  Start of study was defined as the 
signing of the informed consent by the first subject. 
PK: pharmacokinetics 
† When the subject was NOT using prohibited medication that required washout, the reference Holter may have been 
applied at screening.   If prohibited medication needed to be washed out, the reference Holter was applied on day -4 to 
-1 after washout of the prohibited medication.  The wash-out period was 5 times the half-life of the prohibited 
medication. 
‡ Wash-out started after the eligibility of the subject was confirmed. 
§ During follow-up, 3 pharmacokinetic samples were taken according to the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme – 1 
sample on day 2 and 1 sample in 2 of the following intervals: day 3: 48-56 h, day 4: 72-80 h, day 5: 96-104 h, day 6: 
120-128 h, day 7: 144-152 h. 
¶ EoS assessments on the last pharmacokinetic sampling day; depending on the intervals chosen, at day 4, 5, 6 or 7.   
Assessor´s comment  
Sparse sampling scheme was applied with individual pharmacokinetic samples to be collected at 6 
separate time-windows post-dose. Samples from all subjects were required in the interval 0.5 to 32 
hours post-dose (4 samples).Two additional samples were schemed to be taken between day 3 and 
day 7. In adults, the mirabegron terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) is approximately 50 hours.  
Study population /Sample size 
Male or female children with NDO from 3 to less than 12 years of age, and male and female children 
with OAB from 5 to less than 12 years of age with documented diagnosis according to the International 
Children’s Continence Society(ICCS) criteria of NDO, or Idiopathic OAB and body weight of ≥ 15.0 kg 
were included in the study. The study was designed to keep the number of pediatric subjects as low as 
possible. It was expected to dose 6 subjects with NDO or OAB. To fulfill an FDA Written Request 
stipulating to enroll at least 6 subjects with NDO, 3 NDO subjects were added to the already recruited 
group of 3 NDO and 3 OAB subjects. In total, 6 subjects with NDO and 3 subjects with OAB were 
enrolled. 
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 6/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the protocol amendment came into effect, 6 subjects (3 NDO and 3 OAB) had already been 
dosed. Therefore, to allow for 6 NDO subjects in the study, the sample size was adjusted to reflect 9 
planned subjects (6 with NDO). 
All analyses as described were performed for all subjects and for NDO subjects only. 
Assessor´s comment  
Nine patients were recruited in the study. The inclusion of 3 additional patients to fulfil an FDA Written 
Request is acknowledged.  
In accordance with FDA request, all analyses were performed for all subjects and for NDO subjects 
only. 
Treatments 
Mirabegron 2 mg/ml prolonged-release granules as oral suspension was given orally with a glass of 
water. 
Subjects reported to the clinic in fasting condition (last meal before midnight) and were dosed within 1 
h after completion of the light breakfast and were allowed to have a light lunch > 2 h after dosing. 
The dose level for Study 178-CL-203 was targeted to result in an exposure equivalent to that in adults 
after a 50 mg prolonged-release tablet once daily (target value AUC24 was 188 ng•h/mL) and was 
based on modeling and simulation predictions using data obtained in studies 178-CL-201 (tablets and 
oral suspension dosed in healthy young subjects under fasted and light meal food conditions) and 178-
CL-202. The model adequately estimated the AUC observed in Study 178-CL-202. To determine the 
doses for Study 178-CL-203, a simulation was performed in which for every virtual patient (based on 
body weight samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database) the optimal 
dose was estimated. Visualization of the plotted doses versus body weight allowed selection of possible 
weight cut-offs. Subsequently, various weight-based scenarios were investigated for accuracy in 
reaching the AUC target. For the administration of the suspension, 4 weight ranges were defined.

Doses were based on body weight and targeted to result in an exposure equivalent to that in adults 
after a 50 mg prolonged-release tablet once daily (steady state). Four weight ranges were chosen 
based in modelling and simulation predictors from studies 178-CL-201 and 178-CL-202. 
In the study 178-CL-201 bioavailability of the oral suspension was shown to be approximately 2-fold 
lower than that of the tablets in healthy adults. 
Single doses of mirabegron prolonged-release tablets (25, 50 or 75 mg) were administered to 
paediatric population in study 178-CL-202, already evaluated in procedure no. EMA/H/C/002388/P46. 
Paediatric patients were divided into two age-groups (i.e. 12 to less than 18 years and 5 to less than 
12 years). Doses administered were dependent on body weight. For the low dose and for the high dose 
cohort, weight categories were defined and patients received a dose (either 25, 50 or 75 mg) based on 
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 7/25 
 
 
 
the weight categories.  In general, similar PK was seen when children were compared with adults at 
steady-state. Exposure and PK parameters were dependent with dose, age and food state. Exposition 
was higher in children versus adolescents, which was expected due to the lower body weights. 
Patients with an age range between 3 and below 12 under light fed conditions have been considered 
for this 178-CL-203 study. This seems to be appropriate in view of the results of the study 178-CL-202 
(age and food stage as covariates). Doses were estimated from simulations based on weight using 
data obtained in study 178-CL-202. Fifteen kilograms was selected as the low cut-off, corresponding to 
an age of 3 years. The lowest age and body weight in study 178-CL-202 were 7 years and 21 
kilograms respectively. 
It seems that 178-CL-202 and 178-CL-203 studies are to be used to determine the doses for phase 
II/III studies in the paediatric population. This approach is considered in principle adequate whenever 
a justification is provided for using one-dose versus multiple-dose concentrations for the comparison 
with steady-state levels in adults.  
Volumes to be used are within 40 and 65 ml which is much more than desired. Higher strength, i.e. 8 
mg/ml oral suspension, might have been used. Nevertheless, prolonged release tablets would be a 
more suitable formulation for the older children. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic variables assessed were AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, t 1/2, CL/F, Vz/F, AUC24, AUClast. 
Safety 
All safety and tolerability variables were secondary endpoints. Safety and tolerability were assessed by 
evaluation of the following variables: 
•  Nature, frequency and severity of TEAEs 
•  Clinical laboratory evaluations (haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) 
•  Vital signs (including 24-h Holter heart rate) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ECGs (including interval measurements) 
Physical examination (only date of assessment was collected in the eCRF. Clinically significant 
findings at screening were reported as medical history, clinically significant findings after 
screening were reported as AEs) 
Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Postvoid residual volume (PVR) 
Palatability and Acceptability 
Statistical Methods 
Two populations were used for the analyses, the safety analysis set (SAF) and the pharmacokinetics 
analysis set (PKAS). 
–  The safety analysis set (SAF) consisted of all patients who took the dose of study medication.  
–  The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) consisted of subjects from the SAF population for 
whom sufficient plasma concentration data was available to facilitate derivation of at least 1 
pharmacokinetic parameter and for whom the time of dosing on the day of sampling was 
known. 
No imputations of missing data were considered and all values were included in the analyses 
regardless of being a potential outlier or not. 
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 8/25 
 
 
 
Individual subject mirabegron plasma concentrations were listed and summarized for each time 
interval for the total group and additionally for NDO subjects only. “Spaghetti plots” and individual 
subject drug concentration-time profiles were produced. Noncompartmental analysis of 
pharmacokinetic data was performed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed descriptively. No 
inferential analyses were conducted. 
Changes from Planned Analyses 
• 
It was initially planned to calculate mean plasma concentrations for mirabegron. This was not 
done, because intervals instead of times were specified for pharmacokinetic sampling, resulting 
in variation in actual sampling times between subjects. 
•  By-subject displays of heart rate measured by the 24-h Holter were planned relative to clock-
time and in addition relative to dosing time. The individual averaged 24-h Holter data were 
plotted relative to clock-time only, since plotting individual heart rate relative to dosing time 
would not have provided additional information. 
•  Noncompartmental analysis was done for descriptive reporting of mirabegron pharmacokinetics 
in this study report; however, population pharmacokinetic modelling is still planned for future 
dose optimization and PK characterization. 
Summary of safety variables were presented for the SAF, for the total group and additionally for NDO 
subjects only. No formal statistical testing was performed on these data. 
Assessor´s comment  
Population pharmacokinetics was agreed with the PDCO to characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of 
mirabegron in children as well as the determination of AUC with individual prediction as a primary 
endpoint. This is not the case as only descriptive reporting of mirabegron PK has been presented. The 
MAH states that population pharmacokinetic modelling is planned for future PK characterization.  
Dosage from the present study is based on modeling and simulation predictions using data obtained in 
studies 178-CL-201 and 178-CL-202. No inferential analyses of data from study 178-CL-203 are 
presented at the moment. Company should clarify in relation to the pharmacokinetic modelling planned 
for future dose optimization and inform about phase 3 studies already initiated within the paediatric 
development plan, if it is the case, and the rational for the dosing in children and adolescents.

All 9 subjects have been on antimuscarinic therapy or mirabegron for the treatment of OAB or NDO in 
the month before screening. 
Assessor´s comment  
Patients in treatment with mirabegron were included in the study if the concomitant treatment had 
been suspended at least twelve days before the reference day.  
Pharmacokinetic results 
The pharmacokinetic data were analysed using noncompartmental analysis based on actual sampling 
times. No subject was excluded from calculation of any pharmacokinetic parameter. 
Plasma Concentrations of Mirabegron 
Except for the last sample in a subject with OAB, all mirabegron plasma concentrations were 
quantifiable, allowing the calculation of all primary and additional pharmacokinetic parameters in all 
subjects.

All subjects from the safety analysis set for whom sufficient plasma concentration data were available 
to facilitate derivation of at least 1 pharmacokinetic parameter and for whom date and time of dosing 
and sampling were known (pharmacokinetics analysis set [PKAS]). All subjects in the PKAS provided 
data for each parameter. 
%CV: coefficient of variation; Max: maximum; Min: minimum  
The intersubject variability was as high as observed before in pediatric subjects and adults. The mean 
AUC24 for the total population (227 ng•h/mL) was similar to the target value obtained in adults at 
steady state under fed conditions following administration of 50 mg of mirabegron once daily (188 
ng•h/mL).  
EMA/753154/2017

Overall, the range of observed exposures (AUCinf from 99.7 to 1005 ng•h /mL for the total population) 
was included in the ranges observed in the phase 3 studies in adults for the 50 mg dose (Study 178-
PK-015 AUCtau ranged from 29 to 1082 ng•h/mL over the 6 studies using the 50 mg dose). It can 
therefore be concluded that the dosing strategy in this study was appropriate to reach exposures 
similar to those in adults dosed with 50 mg mirabegron. 
Slightly higher mean AUC24 was observed for the NDO population (265 ng•h/mL versus 227 ng•h/mL 
for the total population).The higher proportion of female subjects in the NDO population compared to 
the total population (4/6 versus 5/9) may have contributed. 
Pharmacokinetic conclusions 
Pharmacokinetic Conclusions for the Total Population 
•  Mirabegron reached Cmax at a median tmax of 3.93 h, and was eliminated with a mean t1/2 of 
26.0 h. 
•  Mean values for the exposure parameters Cmax, AUC24, and AUCinf amounted to 18.4 ng/mL, 
227 ng•h /mL, and 464 ng•h /mL, respectively. 
•  Mean apparent total systemic clearance after extravascular dosing (CL/F) and apparent volume 
of distribution during the terminal elimination phase after extravascular dosing (Vz/F) 
amounted to 338 L/h and 13726 L, respectively. 
Assessor´s comment  
Pharmacokinetic results are exploratory and no sound conclusions can be drawn from them further 
than defining median parameters derived from a limited number of patients. Targeted exposures were 
reached and remained within the ranges observed in adult studies with 50 mg doses at steady-state, 
but direct comparisons are limited as steady state was not reached in the study. 
Intersubject variability was high and in line with that observed before in children and adults. 
Safety results 
Nine children, ranging from 4 to 10 years of age, diagnosed with NDO (6 subjects) or OAB (3 
subjects), were exposed to a single dose of mirabegron oral suspension, strength 2 mg/mL. The 
volumes administered ranged from 40 to 65 mL solution, corresponding to 80 to 130 mg mirabegron. 
Adverse Events 
There were no deaths, serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or any adverse event 
leading to withdrawal from the study. 
One TEAE (pyrexia) was reported in an 8-year-old girl with NDO dosed with 55 mg mirabegron. The 
girl showed the highest exposure for mirabegron (AUCinf of 1005 ng•h/mL) in the total population. The 
fever was observed 5.53 hours after dosing, around the time of the highest plasma concentration of 
mirabegron. The subject received paracetamol and recovered. The TEAE was mild in intensity and 
assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
There were no clinically significant changes in any laboratory parameters after dosing. 
No effects of mirabegron on liver function parameters were observed. One subject met PCS criteria for 
liver function. In the 10-year-old boy with NDO, the AST was > 2 times the ULN at baseline and on day 
2 and met the PCS criteria. The respective events at baseline were reported as pretreatment AEs 
(increased ALT and increased AST). There was no further relevant increase in ALT or AST versus 
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 13/25 
 
 
 
baseline in this subject. Both AEs were mild in intensity and resolved. No further investigation 
(serology) was performed to identify the cause of the increase in liver enzymes.  
Vital signs 
Three subjects with NDO showed vital signs meeting potentially clinically significant criteria, 2 subjects 
for pulse rate (one of which was reported to suffer from pyrexia at the same time) and 1 subject for 
both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Overall, in these 3 subjects no 
clear relationship of vital sign values with mirabegron plasma concentrations was observed.  
No clinically relevant changes were observed in mean SBP or DBP. An increase in mean pulse rate was 
observed after dosing.

The mean changes from predose were 7.8 bpm, 6.0 bpm, 11.1 bpm, 4.5 bpm, 9.9 bpm and 1.8 bpm 
at time points 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, day 2 and day 4 to 7, respectively. The time-matched mean 
difference between reference and dosing day in the 24-h Holter recording showed a peak value of 16.3 
bpm in the 2 to 3 h interval after dosing. However, there was a tendency for higher heart rates on the 
dosing day even before dosing, compared to the reference day.

Electrocardiograms 
There were no electrocardiogram abnormalities assessed as clinically significant by the investigator. 
Increases in corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) > 30 ms and QTcF intervals > 450 
ms were not observed. One subject with NDO showed high corrected QT interval using Bazett’s method 
values around 450 ms at predose, 1 h after dosing and at EoS. 
A 5-year-old girl with NDO had abnormal ECGs at 2 h, 4 h and 6 h postdose, which were attributed to 
artifacts and rendered the ECG nonevaluable. For all other time points, evaluable ECG data were 
available for all subjects in the SAF (n = 9). Except in this subject, all mean QTcB values were normal. 
The 5-year-old girl with NDO showed mean QTcB intervals > 450 ms at predose (453 ms), 1 h 
postdose (450.67 ms), and at the EoS examination (453.33 ms). The QTcB triplicate values ranged 
from 445 ms (lowest value at 2 h) to 453 ms (predose and EoS), all below the 460 ms. No ECG data 
were available 4 h and 5 h postdose for this subject. 
Other safety-related observations 
Because all 6 NDO subjects were on clean intermittent catheterization, data for Postvoid residual (PVR) 
volume were available for the 3 subjects with OAB only. A bladder scan could not detect any PVR 
volume at 5 h postdose in any of these subjects (PVR volume = 0 mL) 
Overall, the study medication was well tolerated. 
Assessor´s comment  
Overall, the study drug was well-tolerated. Pyrexia was reported in an eight years old girl that showed 
the highest exposure in the study. Observation was coincident with the time of maximal concentration 
however Cmax in this girl (23.1 ng/mL) was not higher than Cmax in other patients [Cmax mean (SD) 
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 17/25 
 
 
 
 
18.41 (11.72); min-max 2.56-42.4]. 
The absence of a placebo group, the low number of subjects and the high variability do not allow to 
draw meaningful conclusions about the safety. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This is the first study conducted with mirabegron prolonged-release granules for oral suspension in 
children.The aim was to explore the pharmacokinetics, safety profile and acceptability in pediatric 
subjects with neurogenic detrusor overactivity or overactive bladder, after single dose administrations.  
Patients with an age within the range of 3 and 12, under light fed conditions, were considered for study 
178-CL-203. Doses were adjusted by body weight and targeted to obtain exposure levels comparable 
to those of 50 mg prolonged-release tablets at steady state in adults. The pharmacokinetics, safety, 
tolerability, palatability and acceptability of the 2 mg/ml oral suspension were studied.  
Four weight ranges were chosen based on modelling and simulation predictions from two other studies, 
i.e. a relative bioavailability study in healthy adults, and a phase I study using mirabegron prolonged 
release tablets in children ≥5 years and adolescents. Fifteen kilograms was selected as the lower cut-
off weight, corresponding to an age of 3 years.  
The dosing strategy in this study was appropriate to reach targeted exposures that remained within 
the ranges observed in adult studies for the 50 mg dose at steady-state. Nevertheless, direct 
comparisons are limited as steady state was not reached in the paediatric study.  
Pharmacokinetic results are exploratory and interpretation should be treated with caution beyond 
defining median parameters derived from a limited number of patients. 
The intersubject variability was as high as observed before. 
It seems that joined results from 178-CL-202 and 178-CL-203 studies are to be used to determine the 
doses for phase II/III studies in the paediatric population. This approach is considered in principle 
adequate whenever a justification is provided for using one-dose versus multiple-dose concentrations 
for the comparison with steady-state levels in adults.  
There were no deaths, serious TEAEs or AEs leading to withdrawal from the study.  
One TEAE (pyrexia) was reported in a subject with NDO. The TEAE was mild in intensity and assessed 
as not related to study drug 
Assessment of laboratory parameters and ECGs did not reveal any clinically important drug effects. 
Vital signs meeting PCS criteria were reported in 3 subjects with NDO. The subject with potentially 
clinically significant DBP and SBP values already had a DBP value > 99th percentile at screening. In the 
2 subjects with increased heart rate no correlation between increased heart rate and mirabegron 
plasma concentration was apparent. The increase in mean heart rate in the 24-h Holter compared to 
the reference day may be explained at least in part by the stress due to the blood samplings and 
assessments done or to be done on that day and additionally the “white-coat phenomenon,” as the 
measurements for the dosing day were done at the clinic, while the reference day was performed at 
home. 
The absence of a placebo group, the low number of subjects and the high variability do not allow to 
draw meaningful conclusions about the vital signs. 
Overall, the study drug was well-tolerated.

Question 1  
It seems that 178-CL-202 and 178-CL-203 studies are to be used to determine the doses for phase 
II/III studies in the paediatric population. This approach is considered in principle adequate whenever 
a justification is provided for using one-dose versus multiple-dose concentrations for the comparison

MAH Response 
The area under the curve (AUC) was selected as the target exposure metric for dose 
estimation/prediction. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed on mirabegron 
pharmacokinetic data from adults, scaled to paediatric patients using allometric scaling, then externally 
validated with data from study 178-CL-202 (children and adolescents). The model described the 
pediatric data well, particularly the AUC. The AUC calculation is derived from the estimated model 
parameter, clearance, which is independent from the frequency of dosing. 
Therefore, given the ability to well estimate AUC from the model, it was considered not necessary (and 
therefore unjustified) to have the concentrations after multiple dose confirmed in another P1-study in 
paediatric patients before conducting a study evaluating the multiple dose efficacy and safety in the 
paediatric population. The development and validation of the population pharmacokinetic model is 
described in detail in 178-PK-204. 
A summary of study 178-PK-204 is included below by the assessor: 
Study 178-PK-204 consisted in the development of a population pharmacokinetic model to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of mirabegron in adults after administration of prolonged-release tables and the 
2mg/mL oral suspension under fasted and fed conditions (data from study 178-PK-201). The model 
that best describe the data was a 3-compartment model with a combination of first and zero-order 
absorption. Food, formulation, and dose were included in the model as covariates on the bioavailability 
(F1), and body weight was included through allometric scaling with fixed parameters on all clearance 
and volume terms. Final parameter estimates of the model are presented in table 7 bellow: 
Internal validation of the model showed a good prediction of data when predicted v observed 
AUC were compared. The validation using visual predictive check showed bias in the 
absorption phase mostly for those patients receiving tablets.  
Predictive capability of the model was evaluated by simulating the pharmacokinetic profiles of 
mirabegron in children following administration of tablets (Study 178-CL-202) under fasted and fed 
conditions and comparing the predictions with the observations from that study.  
EMA/753154/2017  
Page 21/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The model was further used to determine the single doses of the 2 mg/mL oral suspension under fed 
conditions in children that result in a similar exposure (AUC24h) to 50 mg tablets qd in adults at 
steady state (Study 178-CL-203).  
The final dosing table for 178-CL-203 (2 mg/mL oral suspension) is shown below: 
And finally the model was used to determine a weight cutoff after which 25 and 50 mg daily tablet 
doses under fed conditions in children at steady state results in a similar exposure (AUC24h) to adults 
at the same doses (Study 178-CL-206A). And based on the bioequivalent profiles of the 2 mg/mL and 
8 mg/mL oral suspension, the dose of the last suspension that under fed conditions in children results 
in a similar exposure at steady state to the exposures (AUC24h) of 25 and 50 mg tablets qd in adults 
at steady state(Study 178-CL-206A) was predicted. Based on the simulations the following dosing 
table was proposed for 178-CL-206A (tablet and 8 mg/mL oral suspension).

Assessor's comments:  
A  population  pharmacokinetic  model  in  adults  has  been  presented.  The  model  consists  of  a  3-
compartment  mamillary  model  with  food,  formulation,  and  dose  as  covariates  on  the  bioavailability 
(F1) with an allometric scaling of disposition parameters on body weight. The internal validation of the 
model showed bias during the absorption phase. This bias was also seen when data for children were 
predicted. The model under predicted plasma concentrations of mirabegron in children and adolescents 
during the absorption phase when high doses were administered.  
In  spite of  such  bias  the model  was  used  to  determine  the  dosing  recommendations  for  studies  178-
CL-203 (oral suspension) and 178-CL-206A (tablets and suspension) in children.  
Conclusion 
Issue solved 
Question 2  
Population pharmacokinetics was agreed with the PDCO to characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of 
mirabegron in children as well as the determination of AUC with individual prediction as a primary 
endpoint. This is not the case as only descriptive reporting of mirabegron pharmacokinetics is 
presented. The applicant states that population pharmacokinetic modelling is planned for future. The 
MAH is requested to provide clarifications in relation to the pharmacokinetic modelling planned for dose 
optimization and inform about phase 3 studies already initiated within the paediatric development plan, 
if it is the case, and the rational for the dosing in children and adolescents. 
MAH Response 
We confirm that the clinical study report for study 178-CL-203 does include the descriptive results of 
the non-compartmental analysis. However, the population pharmacokinetic model described in the 
above response (178-PK-204) was used to optimize dosing in subsequent paediatric studies. The 
model has been updated with data from studies 178-CL-202 and 178-CL-203 (178-PK-205). A key 
conclusion is that the individual estimates of exposure (AUCinf) based on the NCA assessment are 
similar to those derived from the population pharmacokinetic model. The population PK model will be 
further updated with the paediatric pharmacokinetic data from the currently ongoing study 178-CL-
206, and will be used to increase the understanding of paediatric pharmacokinetics for mirabegron as 
well as further optimize paediatric dosing. 
A summary of study 178-PK-205 is included below by the assessor: 
The pharmacokinetic and demographic data from study 178-CL-201 was pooled with that from studies 
178-CL-202 and 178-CL-203 in pediatric patients. In the final model including pediatric patients, D1 
(the duration of the zero-order absorption model) was estimated rather than fixed. Interindividual 
variability terms for F1 and D1 were added to the OMEGA block; in the adult model, the variability on 
D1 had not been estimated. The final parameter estimates are presented in table 1 bellow:

Individual predictions from the model for children a adolescents are depicted in figure 2 bellow:

Assessor's comments: 
An  update  of  the  population  pharmacokinetic  model  from  study  178-CL-204  was  presented.  The  new 
model pooled data from adults and children. The new model consisted of a 3-compartment mamillary 
model  with  food,  formulation,  and  dose  as  covariates  on  the  bioavailability  (F1)  with  an  allometric 
scaling  of  disposition  parameters  on  body  weight.  In  this  model  D1  (the  duration  of  the  zero-order 
absorption model) was estimated rather than fixed and interindividual variability terms for F1 and D1 
were added to the OMEGA block. Although the model is claimed to predict the data with no bias, the 
assessor is concerned with this claim, since individual predictions in children does not seem to match 
with observations, especially for the cohorts receiving high doses. The values of AUCinf predicted with 
the model are lower than the values of AUC calculated directly from the observations by means of NCA. 
The  applicant  should  consider  how  this  under  prediction  of  plasma  concentrations  and  AUCinf  would 
affect to the safety of any dosing schedules that are predicted based on the presented model. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved 
6.  Updated Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
With the responses submitted, all questions have now been resolved and this procedure could be 
considered finalized.  
The presented information is consistent with the existing knowledge about the compound. There are no 
new or unexpected safety signals. The PK data is also in line with the expected profile. The limited 
available information regarding acceptability and palatability of the suspension prevent from reaching 
valid conclusions on this respect. 
The approach of the MAH to optimized paediatric dosing using pharmacokinetic modelling and 
simulation is supported. Nevertheless, the MAH should keep in mind the limitations of the PK model for 
predicting individual parameters in children, in order to anticipate potential safety issues, especially for 
the cohorts receiving higher doses.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Sunitinib is an orally active small molecule with anti-tumour properties that are mediated through the 
inhibition  of multiple  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (RTKs).  These  RTKs  are  important  in  the  regulation  of 
tumour  cell  growth,  angiogenesis,  and  metastasis.  Specifically,  sunitinib  is  a  potent  ATP-competitive 
inhibitor  of  the  catalytic  activity  of  a  group  of  closely  related  RTKs  consisting  of  vascular  endothelial 
growth  factor  receptor  (VEGFR)-1,  -2,  and  -3,  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor  (PDGFR)-α 
and  -β,  stem  cell  factor  receptor  (KIT),  colony  stimulating  factor-1  receptor  (CSF-1R),  Fms-like 
tyrosine kinase-3 receptor (FLT-3), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (rearranged 
during transfection, RET).  Due to its multi-targeted profile, the activity of sunitinib is likely mediated 
by  multiple  distinct  anti-tumour  mechanisms.    Sunitinib  has  demonstrated  clinical  efficacy  with  an 
acceptable  safety  profile  for  the  treatment  of  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST)  and  metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma (MRCC).   
Sunitinib was  first  approved  in  2006  in  the  United  States  and Europe  for  the  treatment  of  GIST  after 
failure of imatinib mesylate due to resistance or intolerance as well as for the treatment of advanced 
MRCC,  and  was  subsequently  approved  for  both  indications  in  Japan  in  2008.  Sunitinib  has  been 
approved in more than 90 countries worldwide. 
This type II variation has been submitted by the MAH with the aim of supporting the use of sunitinib 
for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumours  (NET).  The  initially  proposed 
indication by the MAH was: 
Treatment of patients with unresectable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNET) 
This  application  concerns  the  update  of  SmPC  section  4.1  with  a  new  indication  and  also  a  new  dose 
schedule in SmPC section 4.2 for this new indication. Furthermore, related SmPC sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 
and 5.1 have been amended. The package leaflet has been amended accordingly. 
Pancreatic NET Epidemiology 
Neuroendocrine  tumours  (NET),  including  pancreatic  islet  cell  tumour,  are  uncommon  neoplasms. 
Pancreatic NETs (pNETs) include a group of rare tumours of the endocrine pancreas. Collectively, these 
tumours are referred to as pancreatic islet cell tumours, malignant neoplasms of Islets of Langerhans 
(ICD-9), and gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NET (2000 WHO classification), although individually, they 
may  be  referred  to  by  the  hormone  secreted  [e.g.,  insulinoma,  gastrinoma,  glucagonoma,  or 
vasoactive  intestinal  peptidoma  (VIPoma)].  In  the  WHO  classification,  these  tumours  are  further 
classified into three groups according to malignant potential:  
1)  well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour,  
2)  well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, and  
3)  poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.   
Because  these  three  groups  demonstrate  differences  in  prognosis,  treatment  approaches  and  clinical 
trials for these groups are distinct. The disease under study for this variation application reflected the 
second group – well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma – and the inclusion criteria of the pivotal 
trial comprised (among others) well-differentiated pancreatic islet cell tumour (according to WHO 2000 
classification),  locally-advanced  or  metastatic  disease  with  disease  progression  documented,  and 
disease not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined modality therapy with curative intent. 
 
 
 
 
 
Well-differentiated  pancreatic  islet  cell  tumours  including  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  carcinoma 
[2000 WHO  classification],  are  often  described  as  slow  growing,  although  subsets  of  patients  with 
documented  disease  progression  may  have  more  aggressive  disease  that  leads  to  greater  disease-
related  morbidity  and  mortality.  Pancreatic  NET  are  distinguished  from  the  more  common 
adenocarcinoma  of  the  exocrine  pancreas  and  from  poorly-differentiated  neuroendocrine  carcinoma. 
Epidemiologic data on pancreatic NET are limited and potentially represent underreported data due to 
the  lack  of  validated,  well-defined  pathologic  criteria  and  varying  nomenclature  for  these  rare  and 
heterogeneous  tumours.  In  the  United  States,  the  age-adjusted  annual  incidence  of  pancreatic  NET 
among  males  is  0.38  per  100,000  and  among  females  is  0.27  per  100,000;  the  median  age  of 
diagnosis is 60 years (mean 59 years; SD 15) (SEER Registry for 2000 to 2004). Intriguing data from 
US registries (Yao, Journal of Clinical Oncology, JCO, 2008) showed that the incidence and prevalence 
of  neurondocrine  tumours,  including  pNETs,  rose  over  the  last  three  decades.  Although  similar 
epidemiology  data  do  not  exist  in  the  European  patient  population,  the  incidence  is  likely  consistent 
with that in the United States. 
These  tumours  may  be  either  functional,  producing  peptides  which  cause  characteristic  hormonal 
syndromes (insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma), or non-functional but capable of causing 
general symptoms. The putative cells of origin for this malignancy have been referred to as APUD cells 
for  their  ability  for  amine  precursor  uptake  and  decarboxylation,  and  they  form  clusters  within  the 
pancreatic  parenchyma.  Specific  cell  types,  such  as  alpha,  beta,  delta,  G,  and  PP,  produce  the 
hormones  glucagon,  insulin,  somatostatin,  gastrin,  and  pancreatic  polypeptide,  respectively.  The 
mechanism  of  malignant  transformation  of  these  cells  remains  unknown;  however,  these  tumours  do 
occur  as  part  of  inherited  predisposition  syndromes,  including  MEN1  and  VHL.  MEN1  is  an  autosomal 
dominant condition caused by mutation in the MEN1 gene, which encodes menin, a putative inhibitor of 
transcription,  and  is  associated  with  several  tumour  types;  approximately  75%  of  these  individuals 
develop NET of the pancreatic islet cells or duodenum. VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder caused 
by  mutation  in  the  von  Hippel-Lindau  (VHL)  tumour  suppressor  gene.  The  resulting  protein  can  no 
longer  function  in  targeting  hypoxia-inducible  factor  (HIF)  for  breakdown,  leading  to  increased  and 
abnormal blood vessel formation; this disorder is characterized by a predisposition for several vascular 
tumours,  including  renal  cell  carcinoma  and  pancreatic  NET  (Glenn  et  al.,  1992).  Although  there  are 
limited  data  describing  a  direct  mechanistic  link  between  dysfunctional  menin  and  angiogenesis,  an 
angiogenic association has been described in the setting of VHL, where angiogenesis in several tumour 
types,  including  pancreatic  NET  and  renal  cell  carcinoma,  putatively  plays  an  important  role  in 
carcinogenesis.  The  mechanism  for  increased  angiogenesis  in  the  setting  of  VHL  includes 
overexpression  of  VEGF.  Indeed,  pancreatic  NET  and  their  associated  stroma  have  been  shown  to 
overexpress both, VEGF and PDGF, as well as their receptors, VEGFR and PDGFR (Reidy et al., 2009).  
The  VEGF  pathway  may  be  particularly  important  in  promoting  tumour  growth  and  angiogenesis 
through direct effects on the tumour vasculature (Christofori et al., 1995; Terris et al., 1998; La Rosa 
et  al.,  2003),  while  the  PDGF  pathway  may  be  important  for  supporting  pericytes  within  the  tumour 
stroma  and  thereby  cooperating  with VEGF in  tumour  neoangiogenesis.  Expression  of  VEGF  has  been 
associated  with  relatively  short  disease-free  and  overall  survival.  Additionally,  a  recent  study 
demonstrated that low KIT expression (assessed by immunohistochemistry) in pancreatic NET biopsies 
was associated with prolonged survival, suggesting that KIT may similarly be a disease-specific target 
for pancreatic NET (Zhang et al., 2009). Together, these data suggest that VEGFR, PDGFR, and KIT are 
rational molecular targets in pancreatic NET. 
The  rationale  for  the  development  of  sunitinib  for  pNETs  mainly  relies  on  the  anti-angiogenic 
mechanism  of  action  of  the  medicinal  product,  because  of  the  inhibition  of  VEGFR  1-3  and  PDGFR. 
Angiogenesis  has  been  shown  to  be  directly  implicated  in  cancer  growth  and  progression  for  various 
tumour  types,  including  pNETs.  Nevertheless,  basic,  clinical  and  translational  research  should  aim  to 
 
 
 
 
 
identify  for  each  tumour  type  its  own  biological  "hub"  (Yosef  Yarden,  SABCS  2009),  that  could 
consequently be  blocked by selective medicinal products. 
IGF-1R  and  mTOR  pathways  seem  to  play  a  key  role  in  pNET  progression  and  a  number  of  mTOR 
genetic mutations as outlined above (tuberosclerosis, neurofibromatosis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome) 
are associated with pNET development. Moreover, preclinical data support a close interaction between 
IGF and mTOR pathways, fuelling the rationale to combine medicinal products which selectively could 
block  the  aforementioned  "hubs"  (YAO,  ASCO  2009).  So far,  the  following  pathways  have  been  more 
extensively studied in the context of clinical trials: IGF-1 pathway, mTOR pathway and the angiogenic 
pathway.   
Treatment of Pancreatic NET   
Although pancreatic NET (pNET) is typically considered an indolent disease, patients with unresectable, 
locally advanced or metastatic disease and recent disease progression represent a subset with a poor 
prognosis and an expected survival of 1-3 years. Many of these patients may be variably treated with 
surgery of primary and metastatic lesions and/or treated with liver-directed therapies such as hepatic 
artery chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation therapy, or ethanol injection (Clark, 2009).   
Although somatostatin analogs may be useful in ameliorating some hormonally related symptoms such 
as diarrhoea, demonstrated antitumour efficacy has been limited primarily to low-volume midgut (but 
not pancreatic) tumours (Rinke et al., 2009). The role of somatostatin analogues has been recently re-
launched  based  on  the  evidence  provided  by  US  registries  of  prolonged  overall  survival  after  the 
introduction of octreotide (YAO, JCO 2008). The use of these compounds in non-functional tumours is 
still  debated.  Preclinical  studies  suggest  an  impact  on  angiogenesis  and  a  decrease  of  the  IGF-1 
mediated  signals.  NCCN  and  European  Neuroendocrine  Tumour  Society  (ENETS)  state  that 
somatostatin analogues may stabilize the tumour growth in up to 50% of patients. The speculation was 
reinforced by the results of the PROMID trial (ASCO 2009) that showed almost a three-fold increase in 
PFS among patients that were treated with octreotide for midgut NETs. The study did not enrol pNETs. 
However,  many  other  studies  did  and  octreotide  is  currently  investigated  in  combination  with  other 
new medicinal products for pNETs. 
Trials of systemic chemotherapy have been conducted with agents including streptozocin, doxorubicin, 
and  fluorouracil  but  have  yielded  low  response  rates  and  have  been  associated  with  adverse  events 
that may outweigh any benefit (Oberg and Eriksson, 1991; Kouvaraki et al., 2004; Vilar et al., 2007; 
Delaunoit et al., 2008). However, in metastatic setting chemotherapy has a limited impact. 
Exploratory  studies  have  also  been  conducted  with  newer  agents,  including  temozolomide  and 
thalidomide  in  Phase  2  trials  (Kulke  et  al.,  2006),  and  with  peptide  receptor  radionuclide  therapy 
(PRRT) (Hörsch et al., 2008). The therapeutic options beyond failure of first line are scant and highly 
debated.  Thus,  there  is  no  standard  of  care,  and there  remains  considerable  unmet  medical  need  for 
an effective agent with an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of patients with pancreatic NET.

1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Pre-clinical data supporting the use of sunitinib in pNET are based on bibliographic references. 
Nonclinical  proof  of  concept  for  sunitinib  in  pancreatic  islet  cell  carcinoma  was  first  observed  in  the 
RIP1-TAG2  transgenic  mouse  model.  The  RIP1-TAG2  model  comprises  a  strain  of  transgenic  mice  for 
which the rat insulin promoter (RIP) directs expression of the SV40 Large T antigen transgene (TAg) in 
beta cells of the pancreatic islets. The Large TAg oncogene is expressed beginning at embryonal day 8, 
and  hyperplastic  islets  begin  to  appear  by  3-4  weeks  of  age.  Solid  tumours  consistently  and 
reproducibly  emerge  initially  as  small  encapsulated  adenomas  at  about  10  weeks  that  progress  into 
large adenomas by 12 to 13 weeks and to invasive cancer by 14 weeks. 
Sunitinib  was  evaluated  in  both  regression  and  regression/survival  trials  in  the  RIP1-TAG2  model.  In 
regression  or  regression/survival  trials,  sunitinib  was  administered  to  12-week-old  RIP1-TAG2  mice 
bearing  multiple  large  established  adenomas.  In  these  studies,  sunitinib  was  associated  with  reduced 
tumour burden and stable disease over the 4-week administration cycle and with a significant survival 
advantage  (Pietras  and  Hanahan,  2005).  In  longer  term  studies  utilizing  RIP1-TAG2  mice, 
administration  of  sunitinib  starting  at  12 weeks  was  markedly  efficacious,  producing  a  significant 
survival benefit and a 65% decrease in tumour burden after 5 weeks of treatment when compared to 
age-matched control animals (Pàez-Ribes, et al., 2009). 
Mechanistic studies in the RIP1-TAG2 islet cell carcinoma model reported that treatment with sunitinib 
for  7  days  reduced  both  the  endothelial  cell  population  (69%  reduction)  and  pericyte  coverage  (71% 
reduction) of tumour vessels (Yao, et al., 2007), consistent with the importance of inhibition of VEGF 
effects on blood vessels and PDGF effects on pericytes in islet cell tumours. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The CHMP agreed that no updated environmental risk assessment is required for this Type II variation 
applied for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Assuming a prevalence rate of about 
10 per million an increase in the predicted environmental exposure can be considered as insignificant. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
Clinical Development program for sunitinib 
The use of sunitinib in pNET is supported by the results of one pivotal Phase 3 study (A6181111) and a 
supportive  Phase  2  study  (RTKC-0511-015).  Two  additional  Phase  2  studies  (A6181047  and 
A6181061) in GIST and MRCC, respectively, are included in this submission to support the continuous 
daily dosing (CDD) schedule used in the pivotal trial.

Continuous Daily Dosing versus Intermittent Dosing 
The  dose  proportionality  of  plasma  exposures  to  sunitinib,  SU012662  and  total  drug  has  been 
previously  evaluated  in  advanced  cancer  patients  following  single  sunitinib  doses  ranging  from  50  to 
350 mg, and multiple daily dosing with doses of 25 to 100 mg (on Schedule 4/2). The dose-corrected 
maximum  and  total  plasma  exposures  were  comparable  between  doses  and  showed  no  dose-related 
trends,  demonstrating  that  the  PK  of  sunitinib,  SU012662  and  total  drug  were  dose-proportional  or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
close  to  dose-proportional  over  the  dose  ranges  evaluated  following  both  single  and  multiple  dosing. 
Similarly, the dose-corrected AUC24 values (at steady state) after multiple day dosing were similar to 
AUC values after single dosing, supporting lack of time-dependence in the PK of sunitinib, SU012662, 
and  total  drug.  Consistent  with  the  linearity  in  PK,  it  has  been  observed  that  the  PK  disposition  of 
sunitinib, SU012662 and total drug was similar among dosing Schedules 4/2, 2/1, and 2/2. To further 
support  the  linearity  in  the  PK  of  sunitinib,  SU012662  and  total  drug  on  Schedule  CDD,  the  steady 
state  trough  values  for  sunitinib,  SU012662  and  total  drug  on  Schedule  CDD  were  compared  to 
Schedule 4/2.  
The  steady  state  trough  concentrations  of  sunitinib, SU012662  and  total  drug  on  Schedules  CDD  and 
4/2  are  presented  in  table  2.  The  dose-corrected  mean  Ctrough  values  for  sunitinib  ranged  from 
40.9-64.2 ng/mL on Schedule CDD and 42.6-57.9 ng/mL on Schedule 4/2. In addition, for SU012662, 
mean  dose-corrected  Ctrough  values  ranged 
21.0-32.7 ng/mL on Schedule 4/2. Similarly, for total drug, mean dose-corrected Ctrough values ranged 
from  58.2-87.5  ng/mL  on  Schedule  CDD  and  63.6-87.2  ng/mL  on  Schedule  4/2.  There  was  a 
from  15.9-25.3  ng/mL  on  Schedule  CDD  and 
significant overlap between the dose-corrected trough plasma concentrations for sunitinib, SU012662, 
and  total  drug  between  Schedule  CDD  and  Schedule  4/2,  supporting  lack  of  schedule  dependence  in 
the PK of sunitinib and SU012662. Therefore, it would be expected that the total plasma exposure to 
sunitinib  and  SU012662  following  treatment  with  sunitinib  37.5 mg  on  a  CDD  schedule  would  be 
similar 
to 
that 
following 
treatment  with 
sunitinib  50  mg  on  Schedule  4/2 
(i.e., 
37.5 mg  42 days  50 mg  28 days).

Based  on  the  PK  data  in  pNET,  the  predicted  steady  state  trough  mean  plasma  concentrations  in 
pancreatic  NET  following  administration  of  sunitinib  37.5  mg  on  Schedule  CDD  would  be  39.6  ng/mL 
for  sunitinib,  18.5  ng/mL  for  SU012662,  and  58.1  ng/mL  for  total  drug.  These  predicted  trough 
concentrations  in  pancreatic  NET  would  be  similar  to  the  trough  concentrations  for  sunitinib, 
SU012662, and total drug following administration of sunitinib 37.5 mg on Schedule CDD in GIST (e.g., 
38.4  ng/mL,  13.6  ng/mL,  and  52.0  ng/mL  on  Day  1  of  Cycle  2,  respectively)  and  RCC  (e.g.,  41.6 
ng/mL, 15.4 ng/mL, and 56.9 ng/mL on Day 1 of Cycle 2, respectively).

There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  observed  in  the  steady  state  trough  sunitinib  and 
SU012662  concentrations  in  the  pNET  subpopulation  as  compared  to  the  carcinoid  tumour 
subpopulation. Steady-state conditions for sunitinib and SU012662 were likely achieved by Day 14 of 
Cycle  1  in  both  cohorts.  No  disproportionate  accumulation  of  sunitinib  or  SU012662  was  observed  in 
either  cohort  across  cycles.  Sunitinib  caused  increases  in  VEGF  and  IL-8  plasma  concentrations  and 
decreases  in  sVEGFR-2  and  sVEGFR-3  plasma  concentrations  in  both  pNET  and  carcinoid  tumour 
subpopulations. 
A6181047  
Based  on  the  mean  dose-corrected  trough  values  for  sunitinib,  SU012662  and  total  drug,  the  PK  of 
sunitinib and SU012662 appeared to be similar (45.0-62.8 ng/mL vs. 47.7-65.0 ng/mL for total drug) 
between this CDD schedule and on Schedule 4/2 in a Phase 3 study of patients with GIST (A6181004). 
No  disproportionate  accumulation  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662  was  observed  throughout  the  study.  
Sunitinib caused significant increases in VEGF and decreases in sVEGFR-2, sVEGFR-3, and sKIT plasma 
concentrations. Significant correlations were observed over multiple treatment cycles between plasma 
VEGF  ratios 
to  baseline  and 
trough  concentrations  of  both  SU011248  and 
total  drug 
(SU011248 + SU012662).  
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Data  from  supportive  clinical  Study  RTKC-0511-015,  in  which  sunitinib  was  administered  at  50 mg 
daily  on  Schedule  4/2,  and  from  supportive  clinical  Studies  A6181047  and  A6181061,  in  which 
sunitinib  was  administered  at  37.5  mg  daily  on  a  CDD  schedule  to  subjects  with  GIST  and  MRCC, 
respectively, support the comparability of the dosing regimens and disease types. 
The steady state trough plasma exposures to sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662 in subjects 
with pancreatic NET appeared to be similar to that in subjects with GIST and MRCC, indicating that the 
PK  of  sunitinib  and  SU012662  were  not  tumour-type  dependent.  In  addition,  the  PK  of  sunitinib  and 
SU012662 appeared to be similar between the CDD schedule and Schedule 4/2 in subjects with GIST 
and  MRCC.  Therefore,  it  was  predicted  that  the  total  plasma  exposure  to  sunitinib  and  SU012662 
following  treatment  with  sunitinib  37.5  mg  on  a  CDD  schedule  would  be  similar  to  that  following 
treatment with sunitinib 50 mg on Schedule 4/2, supporting the selection of 37.5 mg dose on the CDD 
schedule in subjects with pNET. 
The proposed starting dose of Sunitinib 37.5 mg once daily on a CDD schedule is adequately supported 
by the submitted PK data. 
The MAH has submitted an indirect justification for the proposed 37.5 mg daily dosing in pNET: It has 
been  demonstrated  that  steady  state  trough  plasma  concentrations  of  sunitinib  were  similar  between 
GIST and MRCC patients and the pNET subpopulation, respectively, indicating that the PK of sunitinib 
were  not  dependent  of  the  tumour  type.  Furthermore,  the  observed  PK  of  sunitinib  was  similar 
between Schedules CDD and 4/2 in both GIST and MRCC patients. As a consequence, it is concluded 
that the exposure to sunitinib following treatment with sunitinib 37.5 mg on a CDD schedule would be 
similar  to  that  following  treatment  with  sunitinib  50  mg  on  Schedule  4/2,  supporting  the  selection  of 
the proposed 37.5 mg dose CDD schedule in subjects with pancreatic NET. 
1.3.2 Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  sunitinib  for  the  treatment  of  pNET  was  evaluated  in  pivotal  Study  A6181111.  One 
additional study of subjects with pancreatic NET (RTKC-0511-015) was also submitted in support of the 
efficacy of sunitinib for pNET.

Study  A6181111  was  a  multinational,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  Phase  3  clinical 
trial. Subjects  had  progressive, well-differentiated  pancreatic  islet  cell  tumours  (pNET),  not  amenable 
to surgery, radiation, or combined modality therapy with curative intent.  
  Methods 
Study Participants 
Subject  Eligibility:  Inclusion  criteria  included  histologically  or  cytologically  proven  diagnosis  of  well-
differentiated  pancreatic  islet  cell  tumour  (according  to  WHO  2000  classification),  locally-advanced  or 
metastatic  disease  with  disease  progression  documented  radiographically  (CT,  MRI,  or  Octreoscan) 
within the prior 12 months, disease not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined modality therapy 
with  curative  intent,  at  least  one  measurable  target  lesion  according  to  RECIST,  adequate  organ 
function, ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and life expectancy ≥3 months.   
Subjects  were  excluded  from  the  study  if  they  had  poorly  differentiated  pancreatic  NET,  were  on 
current  treatment  for  the  disease  other  than  somastostatin  analogs,  had  prior  treatment  with  any 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  or  anti-VEGF  angiogenic  inhibitors,  presented  with  diagnosis  of  any  second 
malignancy  within  the  last  5  years,  except  for  adequately  treated  basal  cell  or  squamous  cell  skin 
cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri.   
Treatments 
The starting dose of sunitinib was 37.5 mg administered once daily orally on a CDD schedule. Subjects 
experiencing  severe  toxicity  could  receive  treatment  breaks  inserted  into  the  regimen  as  needed. 
Intrasubject  dose reduction to 25 mg was permitted depending on toxicity. Intrasubject re-escalation 
of  study  medication  back  to  a  previous  dose  level was  permitted  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator 
upon  consideration  of  the  subject’s  clinical  status.  Dose  escalation  to  50  mg  daily  was  recommended 
for  subjects  who  had  not  yet  achieved  an  objective  disease  response  and  who  had  not  experienced 
progression or prohibitive toxicity.   
No  other  approved  or  investigational  anticancer  treatments  were  permitted  during  the  study  period, 
including  chemotherapy,  biological  response  modifiers,  hormone  therapy,  or  immunotherapy.  Use  of 
somatostatin  analogs  for  symptomatic  control  was  permitted.  This  medication  was  recorded  as  a 
concomitant medication.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were to be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death.   
Crossover  and  Treatment  on  Extension  Study:  During  this  study,  subjects  developing  documented 
objective  disease  progression  could  be  unblinded  and,  if  assigned  to  placebo,  offered  access  to 
treatment  with  open-label  sunitinib  in  one  of  two  companion  extension  trials  (Study  A6181114  or 
Study  A6181078).  Subjects  who  were  unblinded  at  the  time  of  disease  progression  and  found  to  be 
receiving  sunitinib  were  withdrawn  unless  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  having  the  potential  to 
experience clinical benefit from further treatment with sunitinib. In this case, the opportunity to receive 
open-label sunitinib in one of the extension studies may have been offered on an individual case basis.  
At  the  end  of  the  study,  all  remaining  subjects  were  also  unblinded  and  offered  access  to  open-label 
sunitinib in one of the extension studies. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare progression free survival (PFS) (defined as the time 
from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of objective tumour progression or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurred first) in subjects treated with sunitinib with those treated 
with placebo.   
Secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  the  Overall  Survival  (OS),  Overall  Response  Rate  (ORR), 
duration  of  response  (DR),  time  to  tumour  response  (TTR),  patient-reported  outcomes  (PROs),  and 
safety in the sunitinib and placebo treatment arms. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), 
clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs and ECOG performance status. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
PFS  was  chosen  as  the  primary  endpoint  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in  subjects  with  pNET. 
Sample size 
The  initial  target  sample  size  was  determined  based  on  90%  power  to  demonstrate  a  50% 
improvement  in  PFS  using  a  2-sided,  unstratified  log-rank  test  at  a  significance  level  of  0.05.  The 
assumptions  included  a  median  PFS  for  placebo-treated  subjects  of  22  weeks,  median  PFS  for 
sunitinib-treated  subjects  of  33 weeks,  enrolment  period  of  26  weeks  with  an  accrual  rate  of 
13 subjects per week, and a 10% dropout rate. Approximately 340 subjects were required to observe 
260 events assuming a 44-week follow-up after the last subject was enrolled.  
The design included an interim efficacy analysis using the Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-
Fleming  stopping  boundaries  to  ensure  the  overall  type  I  error  was  maintained  at  0.05  for  two-sided 
tests.  The  interim  analysis  was  to  be  conducted  when  50%  of  the  PFS  events  required  for  the  final 
analysis  had  occurred,  i.e.  an  interim  analysis  was  planned  when  130  events  had  occurred,  and  the 
final  analysis  was  to  be  conducted  when  260  events  had  occurred.  The  possibility  of  an  increase  in 
sample size based on the interim analysis was included.   
The conduct of the study was overseen by an independent DMC.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive sunitinib or matching placebo plus best supportive 
care.  Randomization  was  balanced  by  country/region  (grouped  as  Americas/Australia,  Europe,  Asia), 
with a maximum of 180 subjects per region.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical methods 
Intent-to-treat (ITT): The ITT population included all subjects who were randomized, with study drug 
assignment designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether subjects received any 
study drug or received a different drug from that to which they were randomized. The ITT population 
was the primary population for evaluating the efficacy endpoints.   
The  population  as  treated  (AT)  included  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment 
with  assignment  designated  according  to  actual  study  treatment  received.  This  population  was  the 
primary population for evaluating treatment administration/compliance and safety.   
PRO  analysis  set:  The  PRO  population  included  subjects  from  the  ITT  population  who  completed 
baseline plus at least one on-study EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment while on treatment. This analysis set 
was the primary analysis for evaluating PRO endpoints. 
The analysis populations in these studies are summarized in table 4. An overview of planned statistical 
analyses used to assess the efficacy of sunitinib in Studies A6181111 and RTKC-0511-015 is presented

The time to event endpoints were compared between the 2 treatment arms with a 2-sided unstratified 
log-rank  test  at  the  α  =  0.05  significance  level.  The  rates  of  the  binary  endpoint,  ORR,  for  the 
2 treatment arms were compared with a significance level of 0.05 using a 2-sided Pearson χ2 test and 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. 
Two sensitivity analyses for PFS were planned and performed to test the robustness of the primary PFS 
analysis:  
1)  One  sensitivity  analysis  corrected  for  potential  bias  in  tumour assessment  schedules  by  assigning 
dates for events only to scheduled visit dates.  
2)  The  second  sensitivity  analysis  expanded  the  definition  of  PFS  events  to  include  symptomatic 
deterioration,  administration  of  a  new  anti-tumour  treatment,  and  PD  after  a  significant  gap  in 
disease assessments, in addition to the PFS events defined in the primary analysis. The unstratified 
log-rank test (two-sided, α = 0.05) was used to evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, in the 
ITT population in these analyses. 
Disease assessments were scheduled at the fixed time points indicated in the protocol. Imaging studies 
at screening included at least a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Subsequent imaging 
studies  were  required  only  for  areas  of  known  or  suspected  tumours  during  Week 5,  Week  9,  and 
every 8 weeks thereafter and were required only for areas of known or suspected tumours. Additional 
disease assessments were performed if progressive disease (PD) was suspected. Clinical assessment of 
disease  coincided  with  the  imaging  studies.  Brain  CT  or  MRI  and  bone  scan  were  performed  at 
screening  and  repeated  if  metastases  were  present  or  suspected.  The  determination  of  tumour 
response  and  progression  was  made  by  the  investigator  and  was  based  on  objective  tumour 
assessments made according to RECIST. A minor modification was adopted to accommodate standard 
practice  in  use  of  spiral  CT  scanning  (i.e.,  reconstruction  interval  up  to  8  mm).  The  same  imaging 
modality and technique were used throughout the study to measure disease. 
An independent DMC monitored the safety of the subjects on a periodic basis.  
  Results 
Participant flow 
The  ITT  population  included  171  subjects,  86  subjects  randomized  to  sunitinib  and  85  subjects 
randomized to placebo. Three subjects in each treatment arm did not receive study treatment (5 due 
to the study termination and 1 due to ineligibility).

More subjects in the placebo arm (55.3%) discontinued from study due to disease progression than in 
the  sunitinib  arm  (22.1%).  Termination  of  the  study  was  the  reason  for  discontinuation  for  more 
subjects in the sunitinib arm (47.7%) than in the placebo arm (18.8%), reflecting the greater number 
of ongoing subjects in the sunitinib arm. 
Protocol  deviations  that  were  reported  in  the  CSR  included  one  subject  who  carried  a  diagnosis  of 
rectal  NET  and  15  subjects  who  did  not  meet  other  entry  criteria  that  were  unrelated  to  laboratory 
testing (eg haematology, coagulation, chemistry, TSH abnormality) or blood pressure measurements.   
Conduct of the study 
Subject  enrolment  began  7  June  2007.  The  independent  DMC  reviewed  safety  data  on  3  occasions: 
May  2008,  November  2008  and  February  2009.  PFS  data  were  apparently  provided  at  the  request  of 
the DMC as part of the safety data package. Although the study was designed with an interim analysis 
at 130 PFS events and a final analysis at 260 events, the DMC recommended in February 2009 that the 
study be closed based on their review of safety and efficacy data after 73 events had been recorded. 
According to the DMC: 1) the study’s primary objective had been met, 2) HRs for PFS had been stable 
and  in  favour  of  sunitinib  over  3  evaluations,  3)  the  conditional  power  analysis  indicated  a  high 
likelihood that the study would be stopped at the time of the planned interim analysis, and 4) that the 
incidences  of  SAEs  and  death  were  higher  among  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm.  Based  on  the  DMC 
recommendation,  the  Sponsor  notified  all  investigators  in  March  2009  and  all  subjects  were  offered 
sunitinib in open-label extension studies. The last subject visit occurred on 15 April 2009. The database 
was locked on 17 July 2009. The final PFS analysis was conducted based upon all PFS data occurring as 
of 15 April 2009 (81 events). 
GCP inspection findings 
The  requested  GCP-inspection  was  performed  in  4  investigator  sites.  The  inspection  revealed  several 
critical  and  major  deviations  of  which  the  following  are  considered  the  most  important  for  the 
assessment of this extension of indication: 
For  12/42  trial  subjects  (5  sunitinib-,  7  placebo-  treated  patients)  discrepancies  between  site  and 
inspectors  assessment  of  the  primary  efficacy  criteria  of  the  study  were  found.  These  discrepancies 
concerned: 
  either the status of the disease (objective progression / censored) 
  and/or the date of the objective progression or the date used to censored PFS data  
  Some deviations from the in-/exclusion criteria are not reflected in the CSR, 
One  site  has  not  strictly  followed  the  objective  RECIST  criteria.  Thus,  some  data  reported  to  the 
Sponsor  are  not  in  line  with  the  RECIST  (e.g.    ‘Stable  disease’  was  reported  for  ‘Overall  Investigator 
Objective Status’ despite ‘Progressive disease’ for ‘Investigator Assessment of Target Lesions’).  
The  above  discrepancies  were  not  queried  by  the  Sponsor  and  this  indicates  that  no  checks  of  the 
reported  data  for  the  tumour  assessments  -  including  calculation  of  the  measurements  -  have  been 
performed by the Sponsor. Thus the Quality Control by the Sponsor has been questioned. 
The  MAH  acknowledged  that  “it  may  not  be  obvious  in  all  cases  how  investigators  applied  RECIST  in 
the  determination  of  overall  tumour  assessments”  and  consequently  performed  an  individual  patient 
review,  i.e.  a  derived  tumour  response  assessment  based  upon  algorithmic  application  of  RECIST  to 
investigators’  tumour  measurement  for  each  subject.  This  analysis  is  discussed  further  below  in  the 
results section. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline data 
Baseline  characteristics  including  age,  gender,  race,  and  ECOG  performance  status  were  generally 
comparable  between  the  sunitinib  and  placebo  arms. Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  had  tumours 
that were nonfunctioning; liver, pancreas, and lymph node were the most commonly involved sites of 
disease.  Approximately  89%  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  arm  had  prior  surgical  treatment,  and  the 
majority  of  subjects  (66.3%  and  71.8%  in  the  sunitinib  and  placebo  arms,  respectively)  were 
previously  treated  with  systemic  therapies.  Overall,  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  and  prior 
treatment history of the subjects were similar between the sunitinib arm and the placebo arm with the 
exception of time from diagnosis to study entry, which was 2.4 and 3.2 years in the sunitinib arm and 
placebo arm, respectively (table 7).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Progression-free Survival (PFS) 
In  the  final  analysis  of  PFS  (based  on  a  total  of  81  events)  median  PFS  was  11.4  and  5.5  months, 
respectively, in the sunitinib and placebo arms (hazard ratio [HR] 0.418, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.263, 0.662, p=0.000118). The probability of a subject being event-free at Month 6 was 71.3% and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
43.2%  for  sunitinib  and  placebo  arms,  respectively  (table 8).  A  pre-specified  sensitivity  analysis 
(Analysis  1)  of  PFS  by  using  uniform  timing  of  assessments  (assigning  dates  of  disease  progression 
according  to  the  intended  schedule  of  dates  of  assessments  rather  than  the  actual  dates  of  the 
radiographic  scan)  has  been  performed  (HR=0.407,  95%  CI  0.257,  0.646,  p=0.00070)  and  showed 
consistency  compared  to  the  primary  analysis.  Furthermore,  a  second  sensitivity  analysis  was 
conducted  in  which  subjects  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  symptomatic  deterioration,  started 
anticancer treatment not specified in the protocol, or had disease progression after missing 2 or more 
tumour  assessments  were  counted  as  PFS  events.  This  analysis  resulted  in  a  similar  hazard  ratio  of 
0.393 (0.250, 0.620) and a p-value of 0.000027. Both sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of 
the results.

The  handling  of  data  looks  of  the  efficacy  data  by  the  DMC  was  not  pre-specified.  An  attempt  to 
calculate  the  nominal  critical  value  (Z  scale)  to  establish  statistical  significance  for  the  final  analysis 
was  calculated  using  the  Lan-DeMets  spending  function  both  excluding  and  including  3  data  looks  by 
the DMC during their safety reviews. The nominal critical Z value for the final analysis with 81 events 
without  adjusting  for  the  3  data  looks  was  3.8494;  however,  adjusting  for  3 data  looks  resulted  in  a 
nominal critical Z value of 3.8809. The observed test statistic in the final analysis was 3.8506. Under 
the  more  conservative  approach  of  adjusting  for  3  data  looks,  the  test  statistic  did  not  cross  the 
efficacy  boundary.  As  such,  the  observed  difference  in  PFS  is  not  statistically  significantly  different 
between treatment groups. 
PFS results in subgroups 
The  influence  of  baseline  characteristics  on  the  treatment  effect  of  PFS  was  analyzed  using  a  Cox 
proportional hazards model including baseline factors, controlling for each factor one at  a time in the 
ITT  population;  characteristics  evaluated  included  age,  race,  gender,  baseline  ECOG  performance 
score,  number  of  disease  sites  (i.e.,  organ  sites),  disease  extent  (extrahepatic  distant  disease  vs. 
regional  disease  including  liver),  use  of  a  somatostatin  analog,  number  of  prior  systemic  regimens, 
histology,  and  time  from  diagnosis  (Figure  2).  The  results  showed  the  hazard  ratio  for  the  overall 
treatment  effect  [0.418  (95%  CI:  0.263,  0.662)]  was  similar  when  controlling  for  each  individual 
baseline factor.   
Figure 3. 
Results  of  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  Analysis  of  Progression-Free  Survival  on 
Study A6181111 – ITT Population 
For  sunitinib  vs.  placebo,  assuming  proportional  hazards,  a  HR  less  than  1  indicates  a  reduction  in 
hazard  rate  in  favour  of  sunitinib  arm;  a  hazard  ratio  greater  than  1  indicates  a  reduction  in  hazard 
rate in favour of placebo. 
The  influence  of  baseline characteristic,  previous  therapies  and  time  from  diagnosis  on  the  treatment 
effect  of  PFS  was  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazard  model.  All  the  baseline  factors  were 
entered  into  multivariate  models  and  only  factors  with  p-values  <0.05  following  backward  selection 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were retained in the final model. The final model for PFS using Cox proportional hazards analysis in the 
ITT  population  revealed  that  treatment  (sunitinib  vs.  placebo)  and  time  from  diagnosis  (≥3  vs. 
<3 years) were the only factors retained, and adjusting for differences in time from diagnosis between 
the two treatment arms resulted in a HR for the treatment effect of 0.374 (95% CI: 0.234, 0.599). 
Overall, the treatment effect in these subgroups was consistent with the result in the primary analysis 
regardless  of  demographic  features,  performance  status,  and  baseline  characteristics,  including 
histology, disease burden, number and type of prior treatments. 
The MAH has also performed a number of sensitivity analyses in order to address concerns due to the 
1) lack of independent assessment of efficacy, 2) early stopping of the trial and 3) high censoring rate. 
The  sensitivity  analyses  comprised  amongst  others  evaluations  of  the  effect  of  timing  of  tumour 
assessments,  censoring  for  a  composite  of  specific  reasons  that  might  result  from  undocumented 
disease  progression  (symptomatic  deterioration,  starting  other  anticancer  therapy,  missing  tumour 
assessments  at  2  or  more  consecutive  time  points)  as  well  as  censoring  of  additional  subsets  of 
subjects.  Other  analyses  explored  the  effect  of  somastatin  analog  use  (data  not  shown)  and  prior 
systemic therapies. Details of specific sensitivity analyses are presented below. 
 
Prior systemic therapies 
The  MAH  analysed  the  potential  influence  of  prior  systemic  therapy  on  the  treatment  effect,  i.e. 
between  subjects  who  were  treatment-naïve  and  those  who  had  received  prior  systemic  therapy.  As 
shown in the table below, a similar treatment effect in these two sub-groups was observed.

PFS result per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) 
The  MAH  submitted  a  preliminary independent  third-party  radiological  review  for  PFS,  blinded  for  the 
clinical data, of 84 available radiological images. Central review of the first 84 subjects with submitted 
images for all study time points, which had passed the third party core lab image quality assessment 
as of the data cut-off date of 15 February 2010, was conducted. Further to CHMP request, the MAH has 
conducted  a  BICR  of  all  scans  received  by  the  central  imaging  vendor.  The  set  of  scans  reviewed  by 
the  central  imaging  vendor  included  scans  from  170  subjects  (99.4%)  and  encompassed  all  scans 
reported in the clinical database for 160 subjects (93.6%). 
The results of both BICR analyses (84 subjects and 170 subjects) are shown in Table 10 and Table 11. 
The Kaplan Meier curve of the BICR analysis of 170 subjects is shown in Figure 4.

Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Progression-Free Survival by BICR 
In  addition,  the  MAH  conducted  2  sensitivity  analyses  to  determine  the  potential  impact  of  scans 
unavailable for BICR review. In one sensitivity analysis, information from investigator’s overall tumour 
assessment  was  imputed  for  missing  scan  data  (i.e.  not  received  by  third  party  reviewer)  in  the 
analysis, whereas in the second sensitivity analysis, all subjects with missing scans in the placebo arm 
were  censored  while  all  subjects  with  missing  scans  in  the  sunitinib  arm  were  treated  as  having  an 
event in the PFS analysis.  In both analyses there was limited impact of the missing data on the overall 
results.  In  the  second,  more  conservative  analysis,  there  was  a  HR  of  0.404  (95%CI:  0.242,  0.675) 
with a p-value of 0.000339, and a median PFS of 5.8 months in the placebo arm and 12.4 months in 
the sunitinib arm. 
  Derived Tumour Response assessment 
An  individual  patient  review  of  all  imaging  data  by  time  point  was  performed  for  all  subjects 
randomised into Study A6181111 and included review of the timing of baseline scans relative to both 
randomisation and on-study scans, as well as review of adherence of on-study scans at the protocol-
defined  time  points  as  summarised  by  missing  assessments.  In  addition,  derived  tumour  response 
assessment  based  upon  algorithmic  application  of  RECIST  to  investigator  tumour  measurements  was 
performed  for  each  subject  as  the  MAH  has  acknowledged  that  inconsistent  use  of  RECIST  had  been 
identified during the inspection.  
Method:  Radiographic  evidence  of  disease  progression  was  established  using  RECIST  based  on  an 
increase from the nadir Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) of the target lesions, the presence of new 
lesions,  or  the  unequivocal  progression  of  non-target  lesions.    Progressive  Disease  (PD)  for  target 
lesions  was  defined  as  at  least  a  20%  increase  in  the  SLD  of  target  lesions,  taking  as  reference  the 
nadir SLD (or the baseline, if the baseline is the nadir value).  PD for non-target lesions was defined as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  unequivocal  progression  of  existing  non-target  lesion(s)  or  appearance  of  one  or  more  new 
lesion(s). 
The  overall  assessment  of  PD  for  each  time  point  assessment  was  determined  by  the  algorithm 
described in the Table 12.

Furthermore  the  MAH  detailed  additional  conventions  applied  in  this  sensitivity  analysis  that  are  not 
reported in this summary. 
Result:  Comparison  of  investigator  overall  assessments  and  derived  assessments  demonstrated  that 
the overall assessments of individual subjects were the same in terms of both event status (yes or no) 
and  timing  (within  10  days  of  the  event  status)  for  140  of  the  171  subjects  (narratives  provided  in 
Appendix 1). Additionally, there were 31 subjects where the investigators’ overall assessment differed 
from  the  derived  response  assessment  with  regards  to  either  the  disease  status  (18  subjects)  or  the 
timing of the status (13 subjects). Narratives for those subjects who were censored for reasons other 
than study termination were presented along with the reasons for study termination.  
A sensitivity analysis using only the derived response assessment was performed for the PFS endpoint 
to  determine  whether  the  alternative  methodology  affected  the  observed  treatment  effect.  As  in  the 
primary analysis, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first 
objective progression of disease (PD) or death on study due to any reason, whichever occurs first. The 
same Kaplan-Meier methodology and censoring rules were used in both the primary PFS analysis and 
the analysis based on derived tumour assessments. 
PFS results for this sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 16; the Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS for this 
sensitivity analysis is shown in Figure 5 below.

  Missing scans and early censorings 
Adherence  to  timing  of  baseline  scans  was  also  reviewed.  Baseline  scans  were  reported  for 
167 subjects, and the interval between the baseline scan and randomisation was 30 days or less for all 
167  subjects  with  baseline  scans.  The  median  time  between  baseline  scans  and  randomisation  was 
5 days for both the sunitinib and placebo arms, and the mean number of days between baseline scans 
and randomisation was 8 days in the sunitinib arm and 7 days in the placebo arm. 
Similarly,  adherence  of  on-study  scans  at  the  protocol-defined  time  points  as  summarised  through 
missing  assessments  was  reviewed.  There  were  missing  assessments  at  protocol-defined  tumour 
imaging  time  points  for  12  subjects  in  the  sunitinib  arm  and  14  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm.  Among 
these  subjects  with  missing  tumour  imaging  time  point  assessments,  only  for  3  subjects  in  the 
sunitinib arm and 4 subjects in the placebo arm did have one missing assessment immediately before 
a PFS event. Additionally, no patients in either arm missed 2 consecutive time point assessments; thus 
the censoring rules for the handling of 2 or more consecutively missing scans as described in the SAP 
were not applicable to any study subjects in the primary analysis. 
A summary of the reasons for censoring is displayed in the Table 14 below.

*In  the  sunitinib  arm,  one  subject  (10671003)  was  withdrawn  due  to  a  diagnosis  of  Rectal  NET;  one  subject 
(10421002)  was  withdrawn  due  to  noncompliance  after  1.3  years  of  study  drug  treatment;  and  one  subject 
(10031002) was withdrawn due to pregnancy.  In the placebo arm, one subject (10231003) was lost to follow up; 
one subject (10111002) was withdrawn after a dosing error; one subject (10411010) was withdrawn after the site 
noted the subject did not meet the baseline serum albumin criterion; two subjects (10311006, 10401001) who died 
after  missing  the  first  scheduled  tumour  assessment  were  censored  on  day  1  because  of  lack  of  on-study 
assessments  (rendering  the  time  of  progression  unknown);  and  one  subject  (10411007)  was  withdrawn  due  to

The  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  for  PFS  (see  analysis  1  and  2  above)  were  repeated  using 
assessments derived from tumour measurement data. The results are summarized in Table 15. Similar 
to  the  results  based  upon  investigator  overall  tumour  assessments,  these  sensitivity  analyses 
evaluating the potential impact of differences in intended and actual timing of tumour assessments and 
effects of certain censored events in the primary analysis did not alter the interpretation of a clinically 
meaningful treatment effect for sunitinib when applied to assessments from derived tumour data.

 Censoring of additional subsets of subjects 
The  analyses  regarding  censoring  of  additional  subsets  of  subjects  included  1)  an  analysis  where  all 
subjects who were censored in the primary analysis were treated in the sensitivity analysis as having 
an event at the next scheduled visit, 2) an analysis where subjects who were censored in the primary 
analysis for reasons other than study termination were treated in the sensitivity analysis as having an 
event  at  the  next  scheduled  visit,  and  3)  an  analysis  where  subjects  censored  because  of 
discontinuation  due  to  Adverse  Events  or  Global  Deterioration  of  Health  in  the  primary  analysis  were 
treated in the sensitivity analysis as having an event at the next scheduled visit.   
These three sensitivity analyses based upon investigators’ overall tumour assessments are summarised 
in the Table 16 below.

The  three  additional  sensitivity  analyses  described  above  were  also  repeated  using  assessments 
derived  from  algorithmic  application  of  RECIST  to  investigator  tumour  measurement  data.  Results  of 
these  sensitivity  analyses  based  upon  derived  tumour  assessments  were  consistent  with  those  based 
upon the investigators’ overall tumour assessments and are summarised in the Table 17 below.

Objective  responses  were  reported  for  8  out  of  86  subjects  randomized  to  the  Sunitinib  arm  (ORR 
9.3%) compared with no responses documented in the placebo arm (p=0.0066). 
Among  the  8  subjects  treated  with  sunitinib  who  had  an  objective  tumour  response,  only  1  subject 
experienced disease progression prior to termination of the study. The remaining 7 subjects continued 
with  an  ongoing  tumour  response  0.9+  to  15.0+  months  following  initial  documentation  of  objective 
response  until  the  study  was  terminated.  With  only  1  progression  documented  following  objective 
response,  median  DR  could  not  be  estimated  in  this  study,  although  the  median  DR  exceeded 
8 months based upon the durations at study completion. 
  Overall Survival (OS) 
The  initially  submitted  documentation  comprised  a  data  cut-off  date  of  15  April  2009.  During 
assessment up-dated long-term OS data were submitted, with cut-off date of 01 December 2009. 
Information  on  survival  status  was  obtained  from  Studies  A6181111,  A6181114,  and  A6181078  as 
specified in the A6181111 protocol. Subjects lacking survival data beyond randomization had their OS 
censored at the date of randomization.  
Subsequent to the 30 deaths initially reported (9 deaths in the Sunitinib arm compared to 21 deaths in 
the placebo arm; the OS HR 0.409 [95% CI: 0.187, 0.894]), there were 21 additional deaths reported 
among  the  subjects  who  either  withdrew  from  Study  A6181111  or  enrolled  in  one  of  the  two  open-
label sunitinib extension studies during the follow-up period from 16 April 2009 through 01 December 
2009. In total, 51 deaths have been reported among the 171 subjects randomized in Study A6181111 
as of 01 December 2009, with fewer deaths in the sunitinib arm (21 [24.4%]) than in the placebo arm 
(30 [35.3%]). 
Substantial percentages of subjects on the sunitinib and placebo arms (70.9% vs. 58.8%, respectively) 
were censored in the OS analyses, as they were still in follow-up as of the data cut-off date, and in this 
analysis, the median OS was not reached in either treatment arm. In a follow-up, unplanned survival 
analysis, the observed hazard ratio for death was 0.594 (95% CI: 0.340, 1.038; p=0.0644) in favour 
of  the  sunitinib  arm.  The  primary  cause  of  death  was  disease  under  study  in  both  treatment  arms. 
Overall survival using Kaplan-Meier methods is presented in Figure 6. 
The updated probability of survival at 6 months was 91.6%  (95% CI: 85.7%, 97.6%) for subjects in 
the sunitinib arm and 84.0% (95% CI: 76.0%, 92.0%) for subjects in the placebo arm.  
A  significant  number  of  placebo-treated  patients  (69%)  crossed-over  to  receive  treatment  with 
sunitinib  which  has  most  likely  confounded  the  results  of  the  OS  analysis,  particularly in  the  updated 
analysis. This is a reasonable explanation for the narrowing of the OS K-M curves in the later updated 
OS analysis.

  Quality of Life (QoL) 
Based  on  the  responses  to  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  questionnaire,  health-related  quality  of  life  mean 
scores were estimated through the 10 first treatment cycles. Thereafter, only few patients remained in 
the  study  (<10  patients  in  each  treatment  arm).  The  overview  of  the  number  of  subjects  with  valid 
QoL measurements throughout the treatment cycles was presented, however the interpretation of the 
results is limited by the scarce number of patients included.  
The rate for all questions completed at baseline was 145 of 171 patients or 84.8% (74 of 86 patients 
[86.0%] for sunitinib, and 71 of 85 patients [83.5%] for placebo). At cycle 10 the completion rate for 
all questions answered was 22 of 25 patients (88%) for sunitinib and 10 of 12 (83.3%) for placebo. A 
similar  high  completion  rate  was  seen  through  all  10  cycles  why  the  results  of  this  QoL  analysis  are 
considered  representative  of  the  study  population  but  hampered  by  the  relatively  limited  number  of 
patients included. 
In  a  repeated  measures  mixed  effects  model  the  use  of  sunitinib  did  not  have  any  clinically  and 
statistically significant negative effects compared to placebo on: patient-reported global health-related 
Quality  of  Life  (QoL);  all  of  the  functioning  domains  (cognitive,  emotional,  physical,  role,  or  social); 
most  symptoms  measured  (appetite  loss,  dyspnoea,  fatigue,  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  pain);  or 
financial difficulties. However, subjects did experience clinically and statistically significant worsening of 
diarrhoea at all assessment time points in the sunitinib arm. Subjects in the sunitinib arm also had a 
statistically significant reduction in constipation as compared with subjects in the placebo arm at Cycles 
2, 3, and 4 and a statistically significant worsening of insomnia at Cycles 2 through 7. However, these 
changes were not clinically significant.   
With respect to concomitant medications, 1 subject on the sunitinib arm and 7 subjects on the placebo 
arm started treatment with a somatostatin analog during the study. 
1.3.2.3 Supportive studies 
Supportive Study RTKC-0511-015 
Study  RTKC-0511-015  was  an  open-label,  2-cohort,  2-stage,  multi-center,  Phase  2  clinical  trial 
evaluating the activity and safety of single-agent sunitinib malate in subjects with NET.  
  Methods 
Subjects with two forms of NET, carcinoid tumour and pancreatic islet cell tumours, were enrolled into 
separate cohorts. Subjects were to have histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis and disease not 
amenable  to  surgery,  radiation,  or  combined  modality  therapy  with  curative  intent.  Evidence  of 
measurable disease by RECIST, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate vital organ function 
were also required for eligibility. Subjects with small-cell carcinoma were excluded. 
Subjects  received  sunitinib  50  mg  once  daily  for  4  weeks,  followed  by  2  weeks  off  treatment 
(Schedule 4/2)  in  repeated  6-week  cycles. Doses  could  be  reduced  to  37.5  mg  and  then  to  25  mg in 
the  event  of  toxicity,  and  doses  could  be  increased  to  62.5  mg  and  then  to  75  mg  for  subjects  who 
tolerated  the  study  medication.  The  primary  endpoint  was  objective  response  rate  (ORR),  defined  as 
the  proportion  of  subjects  with  confirmed  complete  or  partial  response  according  to  RECIST.  The 
secondary efficacy endpoints were TTR, DR, TTP, time to treatment failure (TTF), and OS.  
Safety  evaluations  included  adverse  events;  clinical  laboratory  assessments,  MUGA  scans  or  ECHOs, 
ECGs, vital signs, and ECOG performance status 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  Study  RTKC-0511-015,  the  ITT  population  included  all  subjects  who  enrolled  in  the  study  and 
received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
  Results 
Study RTKC-0511-015 included 107 subjects, of whom 66 had pancreatic NET. Median age of subjects 
in  this  cohort  was  56  years  (range  32-81).  A  majority  of  subjects  was  male  (42 [63.6%])  and  white 
(59  [89.4%]).  Twenty-one  (31.8%)  subjects  completed  the  study,  while  45  (68.2%)  subjects 
discontinued  the  study;  the  majority  of  those  who  discontinued  (28  [42.2%])  did  so  due  to  disease 
progression;  other  reasons  for  study  discontinuation  included  adverse  event  (7  [10.6%]),  protocol 
violation (1 [1.5%]), and consent withdrawn (9 [13.6%]). 
Enrolment  into  the  cohort  of  subjects  with  carcinoid  tumour  was  discontinued  at  the  end  of  the  first 
stage of the study because the enrolment criteria for expansion were not met when only 1 (2.4%) of 
41 subjects in the cohort had a confirmed response.   
Within  the  pNET  cohort  of  subjects,  7  of  38  subjects  (18%)  enrolled  in  the  first  stage  experienced  a 
confirmed  objective  response.  Enrolment  was  expanded  to  Stage  2,  and  a  total  of  66  subjects  were 
treated: 11 (16.7%) experienced a confirmed objective response, 45 (68%) had best response of SD, 
and 37 (56%) maintained SD for at least 6 months. Median TTP among subjects with pancreatic NET 
was 7.8 months.

Among  the  secondary  endpoints,  the  median  TTP  was  33.4 weeks  (95%  CI:  28.1,  54.1).  While  the 
median  OS  could  not  be  estimated  due  to  the  limited  number  of  events,  the  lower  95%  CI  of  the 
median was estimated at 97.0 weeks (1.9 years). There did not appear to be a meaningful change in 
EQ-5D  results,  though  the  FACIT-Fatigue  scale  findings  suggested  a  small  but  reversible  increase  in 
patient-reported  fatigue  during  treatment  with  sunitinib.  Chromogranin  A  (CgA)  and  other  tumour 
markers  including  hormonal  levels  were  also  collected  for  exploratory  analysis  in  Study  RTKC-0511-
015.  Twelve  (57%)  of  21  subjects  with  available  tumour  marker  data  (and  elevation  at  baseline) 
demonstrated a tumour marker response, defined as at least a 50% reduction in one or more tumour 
marker  levels  from  baseline  to  anytime  on  study.  Included  were  8  (44%)  of  18  subjects  with  a  CgA 
response. 
1.3.2.4 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Based on the presented PK data (See section of Clinical Pharmacology) the proposed starting dose of 
sunitinib  (37.5  mg  once  daily  on  a  CDD  schedule)  has  been  adequately  justified.  The  observed  PK  of 
sunitinib was similar between Schedules CDD and 4/2 in both GIST and MRCC patients.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  pivotal  Study  A6181111  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  Phase  3  trial  of 
sunitinib  vs.  placebo  in  subjects  with  progressive  advanced/metastatic  well-differentiated  pancreatic 
islet cell tumours. However, although the pivotal study was double-blind, the well-known safety profile 
of  sunitinib  may  have  introduced  bias  in  the  efficacy  evaluations.  The  MAH  has  argued  that  both 
patients  and  investigators  were  blinded  to  treatment  assignments  and  that  the  likelihood  of  effective 
unblinding  of  investigators  from  AEs  appeared  to  be  low  based  upon  the  high  proportion  of  placebo-
treated subjects for whom AEs were considered treatment-related (78.0%). 
Primary endpoint: Based on the pivotal Study A6181111 the final analysis of PFS (based on a total of 
81 events) a median PFS of 11.4 months was observed in the sunitinib arm compared to a median PFS 
of 5.5 months in the placebo arm which translates into a clinically relevant doubling of PFS in sunitinib-
treated  patients.  The  HR  was  0.418  and  the  p-value  0.000118,  although  formally  the  observed 
difference in PFS is not statistically significantly different between treatment groups. The robustness of 
the result was confirmed in a number of sensitivity analyses.  
The CHMP found it problematic that the study was stopped so early and that the final PFS analysis did 
not account for the 3 data looks performed by the DMC. It has been documented that the hazard ratios 
were relatively consistent through all DMC safety reviews and similar to the result in the final analysis 
(20  PFS  events:  HR  0.408,  50  PFS  events:  HR  0.376,  73  PFS  events:  HR  0.397,  81  PFS  events:  HR 
0.418). Although this information does not preclude that the early termination of the trial has led to an 
overestimation of the treatment of sunitinib, it is also acknowledged that a dramatic overestimation of 
the true treatment effect is unlikely. 
This  is  also  based  on  the  fact  that  consistent  results  were  observed  in  all  subgroups  analyzed, 
supporting the efficacy of sunitinib regardless of demographic features, performance status, and most 
baseline characteristics.  
Similarly, although a GCP inspection revealed incorrect response adjudication in a number of cases, a 
re-analysis  based  on  individual  patient  review  and  re-evaluation  of  response  (“derived  tumour 
response assessments”) was consistent with the ITT results.  
As the CHMP questioned the integrity of the primary analysis based on the high and uneven degree of 
censoring, the reasons for censoring have been re-evaluated by the MAH: 56 subjects in the sunitinib 
arm and 34 in placebo arm were censored. 38/56 and 17/34, respectively, were censored due to study 
termination.  18  subjects  in  the  sunitinib  arm  and  17  in  the  placebo  arm  were  censored  for  other 
reasons. Reasonable explanations have been presented for the majority of these cases and have been 
accepted by the CHMP.  
A  number  of  extensive  and  comprehensive  sensitivity  analyses  have  been  performed  in  order  to 
overcome the concerns due to the 1) lack of independent assessment of efficacy, 2) early stopping of 
the  trial  and  3)  high  censoring  rate.  Specifically,  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the 
effect of timing of tumour assessments, censoring for a composite of specific reasons that might result 
from undocumented disease progression (symptomatic deterioration, starting other anticancer therapy, 
missing  tumour  assessments  at  2  or  more  consecutive  time  points),  and  censoring  of  additional 
subsets of subjects (all censored subjects, subjects censored for reasons other than study termination, 
and  subjects  censored  upon  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  or  global  deterioration  of  health). 
All of these sensitivity analyses were performed on both investigators’ overall tumour assessments and 
tumour assessments derived from investigator measurement data. 
Considering  the  very  early  termination  of  the  study,  an  independent  review  of  the  PFS  results  would 
have consolidated the evaluation of the treatment effect. In addition, a certain degree of detection bias 
can not be excluded due to the well-known safety profile of sunitinib and the use of placebo as control 
 
 
 
 
 
arm.  The  result  of  the  IRC-based  analysis  of  PFS  was  consistent  with  the  result  of  the  investigator-
based analysis of PFS. 
However,  despite  a  possible  overestimation  in  the  primary  PFS  analysis,  the  results  of  the  sensitivity 
analyses supported overall a consistent benefit in favour of sunitinib. 
The  CHMP  raised  concerns  due  to  the  limited  number  of  treatment-  naïve  patients  included  in  the 
pivotal study (a total of 53 patients: 29 in the sunitinib arm and 24 in the placebo arm, respectively). 
In view of this, the CHMP considered that the therapeutic indication should include a statement about 
the  limited  data  from  treatment-naïve  patients  as  follows:  Sunitinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
unresectable  or  metastatic,  well-differentiated  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumours  with  disease 
progression in adults pointing out that experience with Sutent as first-line treatment is limited. 
Furthermore, the committee considered that there is a need of further evidence supporting the efficacy 
of sunitinib in an adequate number of systemic-treatment-naïve patients to be submitted as a Follow-
Up Measure. A controlled study would be preferred but feasibility and possible control arms and design 
should be discussed by the MAH. The MAH committed to propose and conduct a clinical study to obtain 
further  evidence  supporting  the  efficacy  of  sunitinib  in  an  adequate  number  of  systemic-treatment-
naïve patients. 
Secondary endpoints: The ORR was modest (9.3%: 2 CRs and 6 PRs) in the sunitinib arm compared to 
0% in the placebo arm. The responses seem to be of a longer duration, but the median DR could not 
be determined (>8 months).The ORR might have been underestimated due to the early termination of 
the study. Of note, approximately 60% of patients in both treatment arms experienced SD.  
The updated analysis of OS showed a trend towards higher chance of survival for patients treated with 
sunitinib. The MAH has committed to provide the final OS analysis as a Follow-Up Measure.  
Overall,  the  analysis  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  did  not  indicate  that  treatment  with  sunitinib  lead  to  a 
significant  deterioration in  QoL  and  most  symptoms  measured,  but  these  instruments  are  notoriously 
insensitive.  As  expected,  sunitinib-treated  subjects  experienced  worsening  in  diarrhoea  at  all  time 
points and a worsening of insomnia at cycles 2-7.  
A  post-hoc  analysis  showed  that  initiation  of  somatostatin  analog  therapy  was  less  common  in 
sunitinib-treated subjects (1.2%) vs. in placebo-treated (7.1%).  
Ki 67 is widely used in decisional algorithm, not only for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. It could 
be of potential interest to verify whether different sub-categories can be identified within the group of 
well-differentiated  PNET,  by  grouping  patients  according  to  Ki  67.  The  role  of  the  Ki-67  index  was 
investigated in an exploratory analysis but definite conclusions could not be drawn as Ki-67 data were 
only  available  for  42%  of  the  study  population.  It  could  be  considered  to  further  address  the  role  of 
ki67  in  the  context  of  a  prospectively  designed  study,  where  a  repeated  testing  could  be  envisioned 
and could help to elucidate the role of this and other potential markers. 
The pNET subpopulation of the supportive phase II study RTKC-0511-015 is not entirely identical with 
the population enrolled in the pivotal study as two different cohorts were enrolled in the study, one of 
which  (66 patients)  was  represented  by  pNET:  Whereas  the  pivotal  study  required  that  patients  had 
well-differentiated  tumours  according  to  the  WHO  classification  and  that  tumours  had  progressed 
during  the  last  12  months  prior  to  study  entry.  These  limitations  were  not  imposed  in  the  supportive 
phase 2 study which included both patients with pNETs and carcinoid tumours.  
The  ORR  assessed  by  the  investigators  was  higher  than  in  the  A6181111  (16.7%  vs.  9.3%).  Overall 
the  results  indicated  that  sunitinib  has  anti-tumour  activity  in  pNET  and  support  the  efficacy  of 
sunitinib treatment in patients with pNETs. 
 
 
 
 
 
1.3.3 Clinical safety 
Safety  analyses  in  this  application  were  based  on  data  from  pivotal  Study A6181111,  which  used  a 
sunitinib  dosing  regimen  of  37.5  mg  on  a  CDD  schedule,  and  from  subjects  with  pNET  in  supportive 
Study RTKC-0511-015, which used a sunitinib dosing regimen of 50 mg on Schedule 4/2. In addition, 
results from studies A6181047 and A6181061, which used a sunitinib dosing regimen of 37.5 mg on a 
CDD schedule in subjects with GIST and MRCC, respectively, were included to support the evaluation 
of sunitinib 37.5 mg on a CDD schedule.  
Additional  information  to  support  the  safety  of  sunitinib  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pNET  was 
provided  from  2  ongoing,  open-label  (sunitinib)  extension  studies,  Study  A6181078  and  Study 
A6181114.  
Patient Exposure 
The  initially  submitted  safety  summary  included  safety  data  from  a  total  of  398  subjects  from 
4 different  clinical  studies  of  whom  316  received  at  least  1  dose  of  sunitinib.  A  total  of  237  subjects 
were  on  trials  of  pNET  (of  whom  152  were  treated with  sunitinib),  and  338  subjects  were  treated  on 
Schedule  CDD  (of  whom  253  were  treated  with  sunitinib).  The  pivotal  study  for  the  application  was 
Study A6181111, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase  3 study of sunitinib 37.5 mg 
administered  on  a  CDD  schedule  in  subjects  with  pNET,  which  included  83  subjects  who  received 
sunitinib  and  82  subjects  who  received  placebo.  The  general  safety  data  cut-off  date  for  the  initial 
submission was 13 May 2009; the data cut-off date for reporting deaths was 15 April 2009. A further 
safety  update  from  subjects  who  had  been  enrolled  in  Study  A6181111  and  who  then  enrolled  in  an 
extension study (either Study A6181114 or Study A6181078) was provided using a data cut-off date of 
01 October 2009.   
In Study A6181111, the median duration of treatment (defined as the number of days from first dose 
to  last  dose)  was  141  (range:  13  –  602)  days  and  113  (range:  1  -  614)  days  for  the  sunitinib  and 
placebo arms, respectively. The median number of 4-week cycles that subjects started was 5 (range: 
1 - 20) in the sunitinib arm and 4 (range: 1 - 22) in the placebo arm. The percent of subjects starting 
10  or  more  cycles  was  28.9%  in  the  sunitinib  arm  and  12.2%  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  number  of 
cycles started was limited by the early termination of the study, resulting in premature discontinuation 
of  study  treatment  in  several  subjects  in  the  study.  31%  of  sunitinib-treated  subjects  had  dose 
reductions vs. 11% in the placebo arm. In contrast, 10% had dose escalations in the active treatment 
arm vs. 24% in the control arm. Limited long-term exposure data exists due to premature termination 
of study.  
In Study RTKC-0511-015, the median duration of treatment (i.e., the number of days from first dose 
to 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication) was 213 (range: 28 – 469) days, and the median 
number of 6-week cycles started was 5 (range: 1 - 11).  
Although Study A6181111 and Study RTKC-0511-015 specified different dosing regimens (37.5 mg on 
a  CDD  schedule  on  Study  A6181111,  50  mg  on  Schedule  4/2  on  Study  RTKC-0511-015),  the  overall 
intended  (nominal)  dose  intensity  in  the  two  studies  was  similar  (37.5 mg  and  ~33.3  mg  per  day, 
respectively). Relative dose intensity was calculated differently in these two studies in order to account 
for  the  differences  in  these  dosing  regimens.  Of  note,  relative  dose  intensity  for  individual  subjects 
>100% was due to intrasubject dose escalation above the starting dose depending on tolerability. The 
mean relative dose intensity in Study A6181111 was 91.3% and 100.6% for the sunitinib and placebo 
arms, respectively, and it was 91.0% in Study RTKC-0511-015. Exposure information is summarized in 
table 21.

Furthermore,  studies  A6181078  and  A6181114  included  subjects  from  a  number  of  previous  parent 
sunitinib  studies  who  were  judged  by  the  investigator  to  have  the  potential  to  derive  clinical  benefit 
from continuing sunitinib treatment or switching from placebo to sunitinib treatment. Only safety data 
from  subjects  with  pNET  (those  who  had  previously  participated  in  pivotal  Study  A6181111; 
103 subjects  evaluated  for  safety)  were  included  in  a  further  safety  update  (120-Day  Safety  Update) 
with a data cut-off of 01 October 2009. It should be noted that subjects from either treatment arm of 
study A6181111 could have entered the extension studies as the result of the study’s early closure, or 
from  the  placebo  arm  due  to  disease  progression  prior  to  study  closure.  Of  44  subjects  who  had 
previously received sunitinib in study A6181111, 3 subjects entered study A6181078 and 41 subjects 
entered study A6181114. Of the 59 subjects who had previously received placebo in study A6181111, 
5 subjects entered study A6181078, and 54 subjects entered study A6181114. Each subject received a 
subject identification number unique to the extension study upon enrolment. For reporting purposes in 
the  120-Day  Safety  Update,  data  were  presented  using  subject  identification  numbers  from  Study 
A6181111.   
The 103 subjects with pNET participated in the ongoing extension studies A6181078 or A6181114 for a 
median  of  179  days  (range:  5-618  days)  and  received  sunitinib  for  a  median  duration  of  162  days 
(range:  5-492  days).  The  average  weekly  sunitinib  dose  was  similar  between  the  Safety  Update  with 
cut-off  1  October  2009  and  the  safety  summary  submitted  with  the  initial  submission;  49  (47.6%) 
subjects had a dosing interruption of at least 1 week and 35 (34.0%) subjects had 1 dose reduction, 
most  commonly  due  to  AEs.  No  subjects  had  >1  dose  reductions,  and  few  subjects  (7  [6.8%])  had 
dose escalations.

Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects with pNET included in the 120-Day Safety Update 
were generally consistent with those previously reported for subjects in Study A6181111 as presented, 
although  there  was  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of  male  subjects  in  the  120-Day  Safety  Update 
population compared to that in the initial submission. 
Adverse Events  
The observed adverse events (AEs) were consistent with the known safety profile of sunitinib and with 
the  diseases  under  study.  The  AE  profile  of  sunitinib  was  primarily  characterized  by  gastrointestinal, 
constitutional,  coetaneous,  and  myelosuppressive  events  that  generally  were  of  mild  to  moderate 
severity. 
The  most  frequent  Grade 3/4  AEs  were  neutropenia  (experienced  by  12.0%  of  sunitinib  subjects  and 
no  placebo  subjects),  hypertension  (9.6%  of  sunitinib  subjects  and  1.2%  of  placebo  subjects), 
leucopenia 
(6.0%  of  sunitinib  subjects  and  no  placebo  subjects),  and  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (6.0%  of  sunitinib  subjects  and  no  placebo  subjects).  Grade 3/4 
abdominal  pain  and  fatigue  were  more  frequent  in  the  placebo  arm  (9.8%  and  8.5%,  respectively) 
compared to the sunitinib arm (each 4.8%). 
There  were  4  (4.8%)  and  6  (7.3%)  subjects  with  Grade  5  AEs  in  the  sunitinib  and  placebo  arms, 
respectively, with 3 subjects in each arm having a Grade 5 AE of disease progression. 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  the  supportive  studies  was  consistent  with  that  in  pivotal  study 
A6181111 and consistent with the underlying disease (pNET) and known adverse effects of sunitinib in 
subjects with solid tumours. In study RTKC-0511-015, adverse events were most commonly associated 
with the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 
SOC,  and  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  fatigue  (92.4%  of  subjects),  diarrhoea  (78.8%), 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nausea (60.6%), and dysgeusia (51.5%). The most frequently reported Grade 3/4 events in the pNET 
cohort  were  neutropenia,  fatigue,  thrombocytopenia,  hypertension,  and  abdominal  pain.  Adverse 
events  reported  in  studies  A6181047  and  A6181061  were  also  consistent  with  those  in  studies 
A6181111 and RTKC-0511-015.  
The most common all-causality AEs (those reported in ≥5% of subjects) recorded on studies A6181078 
and  A6181114  were  Diarrhoea,  Neutropenia,  and  Asthenia,  all  of  which  were  experienced  by  at  least 
35% of subjects. Most AEs were reported with a severity of Grade 1 or 2. The most frequent Grade 3/4 
all-causality  AEs  were  Neutropenia  (21.4%)  and  Asthenia  (10.7%).  Abdominal  pain  and  Diarrhoea 
were  each  reported  in  7.8%  of  subjects,  Thrombocytopenia  was  reported  in  6.8%  of  subjects,  and 
General  physical  health  deterioration,  Leucopenia,  and  Palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome 
were  each  reported  in  5.8%  of  subjects.  The  other  Grade  3/4  events  were  reported  in  <5%  of 
subjects.

Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
The  incidence  of  treatment-related  AEs  reflected  that  of  all-causality  AEs  in  the  studies  evaluated  for 
safety. The most common treatment-related AEs in Study A6181111 were diarrhoea and nausea, and 
both  were  reported  at  greater  incidence  in  the  sunitinib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm,  with 
53.0% and 38.6% of sunitinib-treated subjects experiencing treatment-related diarrhoea and nausea, 
respectively,  compared  with  30.5%  and  22.0%  of  placebo-treated  subjects.  Other  treatment-related 
AEs that were reported at an incidence ≥10% greater in the sunitinib arm compared with the placebo 
arm 
included:  hair 
colour 
changes,  neutropenia, 
fatigue,  hypertension,  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome,  stomatitis,  dysgeusia,  epistaxis,  thrombocytopenia,  rash,  and 
dyspepsia. For a detailed list of adverse drug reactions, see the SmPC (section 4.8). 
None of these commonly listed AEs was reported with Grade 5 severity. Treatment-related events with 
a smaller, but potentially meaningful, difference in incidence between treatment arms were also listed 
in tabular format by the MAH. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The  most  frequent  treatment-related  Grade 3/4  AEs  were  neutropenia  (experienced  by  12.0%  of 
sunitinib subjects but no placebo subjects), hypertension (9.6% of sunitinib but no placebo subjects), 
leucopenia 
(6.0%  of  sunitinib  subjects  but  no  placebo  subjects),  and  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (6.0% of sunitinib subjects but no placebo subjects).  One (1.2%) and 
1  (1.2%)  subjects  in  the  sunitinib  and  placebo  arms,  respectively,  experienced  Grade  5  treatment-
related  AEs.  The  Grade  5  events  were  Cardiac  failure  in  the  sunitinib  arm  and  Dehydration  in  the 
placebo arm.

The  relative  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  the  supportive  studies  was  overall  consistent  with  that  in 
pivotal  Study  A6181111  and  consistent  with  the  underlying  disease  (pNET)  and  with  known  adverse 
effects  of  sunitinib.  In  Study  RTKC-0511-015,  the  most  common  treatment-related  adverse  events 
were  fatigue  (89.4  %  of  subjects),  diarrhoea  (65.2%),  nausea  (50.0%),  dysgeusia  (50.0%),  skin 
discoloration  (37.9%),  and  stomatitis  (36.4%).  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade 3/4  treatment-
related  events  for  the  pNET  cohort  in  Study  RTKC-0511-015  were  neutropenia,  fatigue,  and 
hypertension.  Similarly,  the  adverse  events  reported  in  Studies  A6181047  and  A6181061  were 
consistent with those in studies A6181111 and RTKC-0511-015. 
Most  subjects  (99  [96.1%])  in  studies  A6181078  and  A6181114  experienced  treatment-related  AEs. 
The most common treatment-related AEs (those reported in ≥5% of subjects) are summarized by PT 
in  Table  42.  Observed  most  commonly  were  Diarrhoea,  Neutropenia,  Asthenia,  Hair  colour  changes, 
and  Decreased  appetite,  all  of  which  were  experienced  by  at  least  30%  of  subjects.  Most  AEs  were 
reported with a severity of Grade 1 or 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  frequent  Grade 3/4  treatment-related  AEs  in  the  extension  studies  were  Neutropenia 
(21.4%),  Diarrhoea  (7.8%),  Asthenia  (7.8%),  Palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (5.8%), 
Thrombocytopenia (5.8%), and Leucopenia (5.8%). The other Grade 3/4 events were reported in <5% 
of subjects. There were no treatment-related AEs reported with a severity grade of 5.

In  summary,  the  types,  frequencies,  and  severities  of  all-causality  AEs  in  subjects  with  pNET 
continuing in the extension studies were generally consistent with those in sunitinib-treated subjects in 
the  parent  pivotal  Study  A6181111;  although  Grade  3/4  Neutropenia  was  reported  with  higher 
frequency  in  the  safety  update  (cut-off  1  October  2009)  than  initially  safety  summary  (21.4%  vs. 
12.0%).  No  new  safety  concerns  emerged  from  this  evaluation,  when  viewed  in  the  context  of  a  low 
discontinuation rate due to Neutropenia and only 1 neutropenia-associated SAE reported. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
  Deaths 
In Study A6181111, there were fewer deaths among sunitinib-treated subjects (9 [10.8%]) compared 
with placebo-treated subjects (21 [25.6%]). 
The  most  common  cause  of  death  in  both  treatment  arms  was  “Disease  under  Study.”  Two  deaths 
were attributed to treatment with study drug. One subject in the sunitinib arm died of cardiac failure, 
and 1 subject in the placebo arm died of dehydration. Both were considered by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment. 
The results of the supportive studies are consistent with results from Study A6181111, and the most 
common reason for death was “Progression of the Disease under Study.”  Two of 26 on-study deaths in 
the  supportive  studies  were  considered  related  to  treatment  with  sunitinib  (Study  RTKC-0511-015  – 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  and  Study  A6181047  –  septic  shock),  and  1  of  96  deaths  during  the 
follow up period (Study A6101061 – acute myeloid leukaemia) was considered related to treatment. 
Eighteen  (17.5%)  deaths  were  reported  for  subjects  with  pNET  in  studies  A6181078  and  A6181114 
(Table  46).  Eleven  deaths  occurred  during  the  on-study  period,  and  7  deaths  occurred  during  the 
follow-up period. Eight of the 11 deaths that occurred during the on-study period were due to “Disease 
under Study”. Of the remaining 3 on-study deaths, 2 occurred as the result of AEs (Renal failure and 
Hepatic  encephalopathy)  that  were  not  considered  related  to  study  treatment  but  due  to  the  disease 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
under study, and 1 death was a sudden death of unknown origin. All deaths that occurred during the 
follow-up period were due to “Disease under Study”.

Of  the  18  deaths  summarized  in  Table  27,  10  were  initially  reported  in  the  safety  summary  (Study 
A6181111).  Of  the  8  deaths  not  previously  reported,  5  occurred  during  the  on-study  period  and 
3 occurred during the follow-up period. Four of the 5 deaths that occurred during the on-study period 
were  due  to  “Disease  under  Study,  and  1  death  was  a  sudden  death  of  unknown  origin. All  3  deaths 
that occurred during the follow-up period were due to “Disease under Study”. 
  Serious Adverse Events 
Subjects with pancreatic NET who experienced a Grade 5 AE during Study A6181078 or A6181114 are 
presented in Table 28. These AEs were generally considered to be due to the disease under study, and 
all were reported as SAEs. The deaths of 4 subjects were previously reported.

 
Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events   
In  pivotal  Study  A6181111,  treatment-related  SAEs  were  experienced  by  a  greater  proportion  of 
sunitinib-treated  subjects  (11  [13.3%])  than  placebo-treated  subjects  (6  [7.3%]).  Among  subjects 
who received sunitinib, the most commonly reported events were abdominal pain upper, nausea, and 
renal  failure.  Among  placebo-treated  subjects,  treatment-related  SAEs  were  limited  to  single 
occurrences  of  abdominal  pain,  pyrexia,  pneumonia,  dehydration,  back  pain,  pleurisy,  pulmonary 
embolism, and deep vein thrombosis.  
In  the  supportive  studies,  the  incidences  of  treatment-related  SAEs  (13.3%-25.8%)  were  similar  to 
those observed among sunitinib-treated subjects in pivotal Study A6181111. In Study RTKC-0511-015, 
treatment-related SAEs were reported in 17 subjects (25.8%) in the pancreatic NET cohort.  The most 
common  events  for  subjects  with  pancreatic  NET  were  vomiting  (5  subjects,  7.6%),  dehydration, 
fatigue, and nausea (each 3 subjects, 4.5%).  Vomiting appeared to be the only event common among 
Study  A6181111  and  all 3  supportive  studies.   Treatment-related  SAEs  for  all  4  studies  are  shown  in 
table 14. 
Eleven  (10.7%)  subjects  who  received  sunitinib  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-related  SAE.  Five 
(4.9%) subjects experienced treatment-related SAEs reported for the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, 
and 2 (1.9%) subjects experienced treatment-related SAEs reported for the Respiratory, Thoracic and 
Mediastinal Disorders SOC.  Other SAE SOCs were limited to single occurrences. 
Treatment-related SAEs are listed in table below.

Adverse Events of special interest 
Selected  safety  topics  of  special  interest  to  sunitinib  were  chosen  based  on  their  clinical  significance 
and  association  with  other  in-class  RTK  inhibitors  and/or  antiangiogenic  agents,  and/or  because  they 
were  the  focus  of  previous  inquiries  by  regulatory  bodies.  These  topics  included  cardiac  dysfunction, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thyroid  dysfunction,  hemorrhagic  events,  and  thromboembolic  events.  Hypoglycaemia  was  also 
included  for  the  pancreatic  NET  population  which  included  subjects  who  had  undergone  pancreatic 
resection,  carried  a  diagnosis  of  insulinoma,  or  received  treatment  for  disease-related  diabetes.  
Although adverse events were reported in each of these categories, there were only two subjects with 
a Grade 4 adverse event (both Grade 4 hypoglycaemia in two subjects treated with sunitinib on Study 
A6181111) and one subject with a Grade 5 adverse event (cardiac failure in one subject treated with 
sunitinib  on  Study  A6181111).  Thus,  severe  significant  adverse  events  were  reported  at  a  relatively 
low rate in these studies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Eighteen  subjects  (21.7%)  and  14  subjects  (17.1%)  on  the  sunitinib  and  placebo  arms,  respectively, 
were permanently discontinued from the study due to treatment-emergent, all-causality AEs. The most 
common  events  associated  with  permanent  discontinuation  in  the  sunitinib  arm  were  Disease 
progression  (3  cases),  Fatigue  (3  cases),  Diarrhoea  and  Cardiac  failure  (2  cases  each)  The  most 
common  events  associated  with  permanent  discontinuation  in  the  placebo  arm  were  Disease 
progression  (3  cases),  Abdominal  pain  and  Hepatic  failure  (2  cases  each).    In  20 subjects  (10  [12%] 
subjects in both arms), the AE leading to discontinuation was serious ; however only 4 subjects on the 
sunitinib arm and 1 subject on the placebo arm discontinued due to an SAE that was considered to be 
treatment-related. 
Safety in special populations 
There  was  no  evidence  of  an  effect  of  age,  race,  or  gender  on  the  overall  incidence  of  all-causality 
adverse events among sunitinib- or placebo-treated subjects.   
Post marketing experience 
Upon  review  of  the  safety  data  involving  cases  for  which  the  indication  was  neuroendocrine  tumour, 
there  was  no  suggestion  that  this  population  was  at  a  greater  risk  for  experiencing  any  particular 
adverse event with sunitinib, and there were no new safety concerns identified. 
  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most common sunitinib-related AEs were generally tolerable and consistent with the known safety 
profile of sunitinib and/or signs and symptoms of pancreatic NET and included Diarrhoea, Neutropenia, 
and Asthenia.  Most of these AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.   
In the pivotal study the most common AEs of all-causality in the sunitinib arm were diarrhoea (59%) 
and nausea (45%) compared with 39.0% and 29.3%, respectively, in placebo-treated subjects. Other 
AEs that were reported at a higher incidence in the sunitinib arm than in the placebo arm included hair 
colour  changes,  neutropenia,  hypertension,  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome,  stomatitis, 
dysgeusia,  epistaxis,  rash,  and  thrombocytopenia.  The  most  frequent  Grade 3/4  AEs  in  the  sunitinib 
arm  of  the  pivotal  study  were  neutropenia  (12.0%),  hypertension  (9.6%),  leucopenia  (6.0%),  and 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (6.0%). 
The types and incidences of sunitinib-related AEs in the follow-up period were mostly Grade 1 or 2 in 
severity and similar to those reported initially for sunitinib-treated subjects with pancreatic NET.  
Most subjects in the extension studies experienced treatment-related AEs (96.1%). The most common 
treatment-related  AEs  were  diarrhoea  (52.4%),  neutropenia  (37.9%),  asthenia  (33.0%),  hair  colour 
changes  (33.0%)  and  decreased  appetite  (30.1%).  Most  of  these  AEs  were  of  mild  to  moderate 
severity.  The  most  frequent  Grade  3  /  4  treatment-related  AEs  were  neutropenia  (21.4%),  diarrhoea 
(7.8%), asthenia (7.8%).  
 
 
 
 
 
Grade  3/4  Neutropenia  was  reported  in  the  extension  studies  with  higher  frequency  (21.4%)  than  in 
the pivotal study (12%) and in other indications (GIST: 10.0%, mRCC: 9.4%).However, the reported 
discontinuation  and  SAE  rates  associated  with  neutropenia  were  low  and  similar  to  those  reported 
initially. 
AEs  were  generally  manageable  through  the  use  of  dosing  interruptions  and  dose  reductions,  and/or 
standard  medical  management.  Temporary  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  occurred  fairly  commonly; 
whereas, the incidence of permanent discontinuations (and deaths) was low.  
The  frequency  of  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  for  subjects  who  received  sunitinib  was 
generally  comparable  among  the  studies  which  employed  CDD  (Study  A6181111,  21.7%;  Study 
A6181047, 21.7%; Study A6181061, 17.8%).  
The  types  of  AEs  resulting  in  permanent  discontinuation  and  the  rates  of  discontinuation  presented 
from  the  extension  studies  were  generally  consistent  with  those  for  sunitinib-treated  subjects  in  the 
pivotal study. 
Treatment-related  SAEs  were  reported  at  a  relatively  low  incidence  and  were  most  commonly 
associated  with  the  Gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC.  The  results  of  clinical  laboratory  investigations, 
vital  signs,  and  ECG  results  did  not  reveal  evidence  of  a  clinically  meaningful  adverse  effect  of 
sunitinib. 
Other  significant  AEs  of  particular  interest,  including  severe  AEs  of  cardiac  dysfunction,  thyroid 
dysfunction, hemorrhagic events, thromboembolic events, and hypoglycaemia, occurred with relatively 
low incidence and did not reveal any new safety risks. 
The results of clinical laboratory evaluations for the safety update with 1 October 2009 cut-off did not 
reveal any new safety risks of sunitinib treatment, consistent with what was previously reported in the 
pivotal study. In summary, the safety profile of sunitinib 37.5 mg CDD in subjects with pancreatic NET 
in the extension studies was generally consistent with that previously reported in the safety summary 
for  the  pivotal  study.    The  AE  profile  of  sunitinib  was  primarily  characterized  by  gastrointestinal, 
constitutional,  cutaneous,  and  myelosuppressive  events  that  were  generally  of  mild  to  moderate 
severity. Investigation of other significant AEs of interest did not reveal any new safety risks. Deaths 
were most commonly due to disease progression. Treatment-related SAEs were reported at a relatively 
low incidence and were most commonly associated with the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC. The results 
of clinical laboratory investigations, vital signs, and ECG results did not reveal evidence of a clinically 
meaningful adverse effect of sunitinib. 
1.3.4 Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  submitted  an  updated  risk  management  plan  comprising  the  indications  GIST,  MRCC,  and 
Pancreatic  NET  (version  7.0  for,  dated  11  November  2009)  with  the  application  for  review.  However, 
subsequently  in  parallel  to  the  ongoing  extension  of  indication  procedure  a  Risk  Management  Plan 
version 7.0, dated 25 March 2010 was agreed by CHMP concerning an updated for the GIST and MRCC 
indications only.  
Therefore, the MAH provided a final consolidated updated RMP for this new indication, i.e. version 8.0, 
dated 19 October 2010.

Listed in the Special warnings and precautions 
for use (Section 4.4) of the SmPC.  Close 
monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms of 
CHF should be performed, especially in 
patients with cardiac risk factors and/or history 
of coronary artery disease.   
Physicians are advised to weigh this risk 
against the potential benefits of the drug. 
These patients should be carefully monitored 
for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF while 
receiving SUTENT. Baseline and periodic 
evaluations of LVEF should also be considered 
while the patient is receiving SUTENT. In 
patients without cardiac risk factors, a baseline 
evaluation of ejection fraction should be 
considered. 
In the presence of clinical manifestations of 
CHF, discontinuation of SUTENT is 
recommended. The dose of SUTENT should be 
interrupted and/or reduced in patients without 
clinical evidence of CHF but with an ejection 
fraction <50% and >20% below baseline.

 Drugs that may increase sunitinib plasma 
concentrations:  Administration of SUTENT with 
potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g. 
ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase 
sunitinib concentrations 
Combination with inhibitors should therefore be

concomitant medication with no, or minimal 
potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be 
considered. 
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT 
may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 
mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the 
tolerability. 
Drugs that may decrease sunitinib plasma 
concentrations: 
Administration of SUTENT with potent inducers 
of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., dexamethasone, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, 
phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum known 
also as St. John’s Wort) may decrease sunitinib 
concentrations. Combination with inducers 
should therefore be avoided, or selection of an 
alternate concomitant medication with no, or 
minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be 
considered. If this is not possible, the dosage 
of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5

The safety and efficacy of SUTENT in paediatric 
patients have not been established.  SUTENT 
should not be used in paediatric population 
until further data become available. (Section 
4.2 of the SmPC) 
There are no studies in pregnant women using 
SUTENT. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity including foetal 
malformations (see Section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
SUTENT should not be used during pregnancy 
or in any woman not employing adequate 
contraception unless the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus. If the 
drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient 
becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, 
the patient should be apprised of the potential 
hazard to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential should be 
advised to avoid becoming pregnant while 
receiving treatment with SUTENT.   
Based on non-clinical findings, male and 
female fertility may be compromised by 
treatment with SUTENT 
1.2.5 User consultation 
With  the  application  the  MAH  provided  a  justification  for  not  performing  a  Consultation  with  Target 
Patient  Groups  for  addition  of  a  new  indication  to  the  Sutent  Package  leaflet  which  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.  BENEFITS AND RISKS CONCLUSIONS 
Benefits 
The primary objective of the study was PFS. Sunitinib 37.5 mg on a CDD schedule resulted in a median 
PFS of 11.4 months vs. 5.5 months in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.418, p=0.0001, 81 PFS events), 
thus translating into more than a 2-fold reduction in the relative risk of disease progression or death in 
subjects with pNET.  
PFS improvement was observed independently of baseline histology, Ki-67 index (exploratory analysis 
only), disease burden, amount of prior therapy, and time from diagnosis.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Improvements  in  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of  ORR  (9.3%  vs  0%,  p=0.0066)  and  OS  (HR 
0.409, 95% CI 0.187, 0.894, p=0.0204, 30 OS events) in the sunitinib arm was also observed.  
Additionally  fewer  subjects  treated  with  sunitinib  than  placebo  started  the  use  of  disease-specific 
concomitant medications such as somatostatin analogs while on study. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  general,  all  supportive  analyses  submitted  by  the  MAH  showed  consistency  of  the  results  with  the 
primary  analysis.  The  robustness  was  further  corroborated  by  the  complimentary  PFS  analysis  based 
on derived tumour assessments and in the IRC-based PFS analysis. Data on efficacy of sunitinib in the 
treatment of pancreatic NET from both pivotal Study A6181111 and supportive Study RTKC-0511-015 
are supporting of the substantial clinical benefit to patients with this relatively rare form of pancreatic 
cancer for whom approved or effective treatment options are currently unavailable. 
Although  the  study  was  designed  with  an  interim  analysis  at  130  PFS  events  and  a  final  analysis  at 
260 events, the DMC recommended in February 2009 that the study be closed based on their review of 
safety and efficacy data after 73 events had been recorded.  
A  major  issue  has  been  the  robustness  of  the  efficacy  results  because  the  DMC  was  supplied  with 
efficacy data during the 3 safety reviews when only 1 interim analysis was planned (after 130 events) 
and why these 3 “safety reviews” were not considered as interim analyses.  
The  CHMP  found  it  problematic  that  the  study  had  been  stopped  so  early  and  that  the  final  PFS 
analysis  did  not  account  for  the  3  data  looks  by  the  DMC.  Only  one  (later)  interim  analysis  was  pre-
specified. When accounting for these additional “safety reviews”, the p-value did not cross the efficacy 
boundary (p-value: 0.000104). The observed medians and the HR were estimated based on data from 
a  study  that  was  terminated  at  a  very  early  stage.  It  is  well-known  that  such  estimates  may 
overestimate the true treatment effect.    
However,  it  has  been  documented  that  the  hazard  ratios  were  relatively  consistent  through  all  DMC 
safety reviews and similar to the result in the final analysis. It was also acknowledged that a dramatic 
overestimation of the true treatment effect was highly unlikely.  
Updated  OS  data  as  of  01  December  2009  demonstrate  a  persistent  advantage  for  sunitinib  on  OS, 
with  a  HR  for  OS  of  0.594  (95%  CI:  0.340,  1.038;  p=0.0644,  51  OS  events),  despite  the  greater 
potential  for  confounding  of  the  OS  analysis  due  to  treatment  crossover.  Mature  OS  data  will  be 
submitted  as  a  FUM,  agreed  by  the  MAH,  by  31  December  2014,  5  years  after  LSFV  in  the  pivotal 
study. 
The  CHMP  considered  reasonably  well  documented  that  sunitinib  has  a  clinically  relevant  treatment 
effect  in  the  proposed  indication,  although  the  true  benefit  may  be  slightly  more  modest  than  in  the 
early presented estimate.  
There were concerns due to the limited number of treatment- naïve patients included in the study. The 
MAH  committed  to  propose  and  conduct  a  clinical  study  to  obtain  further  evidence  supporting  the 
efficacy of sunitinib in an adequate number of systemic-treatment-naïve patients as FUM.  
Risks 
In  the  pivotal  Study  A6181111,  the  following  AEs  were  more  commonly  reported  in  subjects  on  the 
sunitinib  arm  as  compared  to  the  placebo:  diarrhoea,  nausea,  hair  colour  changes,  neutropenia, 
hypertension,  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome,  stomatitis,  dysgeusia,  epistaxis,  rash, 
and thrombocytopenia.   
 
 
 
 
 
Grade 3/4  AEs  and  treatment-related  SAEs,  particularly  gastrointestinal  disorders,  were  also  more 
commonly  reported  in  subjects  receiving  sunitinib  compared  to  placebo,  although  at  a  modestly 
increased rate. 
Eighteen  subjects  (21.7%)  on  the  sunitinib  arm  and  14  (17.1%)  subject  on  the  placebo  arm  were 
permanently discontinued from Study A6181111 due to a treatment-related SAE, and only 1 subject on 
each treatment arm had a Grade 5 SAE (cardiac failure on sunitinib; dehydration on placebo) that was 
considered  to  be  treatment-related,  as  the  majority  of  SAEs  and  deaths  were  related  to  underlying 
disease.  
Overall, the observed pattern of adverse events was consistent across all 4 studies and with the known 
safety profile for sunitinib.   
Data  are  consistent  with  those  that  have  previously  been  reported  with  sunitinib,  and  no  new  or 
increased  safety  risks  were  identified.  Therefore,  we  can  conclude  that  sunitinib  37.5  mg  on  a  CDD 
schedule has an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of pancreatic NET. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data are not available in the proposed indication due to the premature termination of 
the pivotal. However, it does not seem to be a major concern as the safety profile of sunitinib has been 
well-described in other indications and as no new safety signals have been identified.  
Safety update from the two open-label extension studies have been provided and also included more 
mature  OS  data  and  AEs  of  special  interest  for  this  type  of  medicinal  product  and  this  indication.  No 
major concerns have been raised on the basis of this safety update.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Treatment  with  sunitinib  as  a  37.5  mg  CDD  in  patients  with  well-differentiated  neuroendocrine 
carcinoma of the pancreas was associated with a positive effect on PFS without important deterioration 
in the QoL of patients. These are important clinical benefits in the context of the existing unmet need 
for this patient population.  
Although the early termination of the pivotal study complicated the interpretation of the study results 
looking at the totality of the data, an important overestimation of the beneficial effects seems unlikely.  
The safety profile of sunitinib is well-described and common AEs are considered manageable. No new 
safety  signals  have  been  identified.  The  benefit  of  sunitinib  in  the  above  mentioned  indication  is 
considered to overcome the risk associated with the safety profile of the medicinal product. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the benefit/risk balance of sunitinib is positive in the following 
therapeutic indication 
“SUTENT  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  unresectable  or  metastatic,  well-differentiated  pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours with disease progression in adults.  
Experience with SUTENT as first-line treatment is limited (see section 5.1).” 
3.  Conclusion

amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package

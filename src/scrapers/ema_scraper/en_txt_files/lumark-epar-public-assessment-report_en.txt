2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lutetium chemically belongs to one of two special groups of the Periodic Tables called Lanthanides.  The other 
group – actinides - is more widely known as it contains the nuclear fuel elements uranium and plutonium.  The 
Lanthanides series starts with lanthanum (La, Z = 57) and ends with Lutetium (Lu, Z = 71).  All lanthanides 
commonly favour the (III) oxidation resulting in great similarity among these elements.  Lutetium is not the only 
element from the series which is used for radiopharmaceutical purposes, but cerium (Ce), samarium (Sa), 
gadolinium (Gd), holmium (Ho) and ytterbium (Yb) likewise are currently under investigation for their suitability 
as radiopharmaceutical label.  The lanthanides are often referred to as the rare earth elements with lutetium 
being the less abundant of these. 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is produced by irradiation of 176Lu with neutrons. 177Lu is a medium-energy 
β-emitter with a maximum energy of 0.5 MeV and a maximal tissue penetration of 2 mm. 177Lu decays with a 
half-life (t1/2) of 6.647 days by beta decay to form the stable Hafnium nuclide, 177Hf. The maximum beta 
energy for the decay of 177Lu to 177Hf is 0.497 MeV. The average beta energy is approximately 0.13 MeV. Also 
low gamma energy is emitted, for instance at 113 keV (6.2%) and 208 keV (11%). The emission of gamma rays 
allows scintigraphy and subsequent dosimetry with the same therapeutic compound. 
Lumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor solution containing 80 GBq (becquerel) Lutetium (177-Lu) chloride 
per mL.  It is packaged in colourless type I glass vial of 10 ml, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and 
aluminium overseal.  Each vial contains an activity ranging from 8 to 400 GBq which corresponds to an amount 
of 16 microgram to 800 micrograms Lutetium.  The volume of one vial ranges from 0.1 – 5.0 ml solution.  
Lumark is indicated in adults for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed 
for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.  As Lumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor, it is not designed to be 
given directly to patients.   
In accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended the application relies on well-established 
medicinal use supported by bibliographic literature. According to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as 
amended it is possible to replace results of pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed references to published 
scientific literature (information available in the public domain) if it can be demonstrated that the active 
substance of a medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal use within the Community for at least 
10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In this regard, the provisions of Annex I 
(Part II.1) to Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply.  The applicant has submitted a document to support the 
application as a well-established use where the fulfilment of the requirements of article 10a application are 
discussed as follows: 
a) Factors which have been taken into account by the CHMP in order to establish a well-established use 
- Time over which the substance has been used 
Lutetium has been used in the treatment of NETs since 2000 and it is the third generation of receptor targeted 
radionucleotide therapy. Quantitatively, lutetium has been shown to be widely used in studies and also in supply 
data from the applicant. 
- Quantitative aspects of use of the substance 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 8/53 
  
  
A study between 2000 and 2006 showed 504 patients treated with 1772 administrations of study drug. The 
applicant’s supply of lutetium in Becquerel from 2003-2013 shows over 500 patients treated in 2003, increasing 
year on year to nearly 3000 patients in 2013. Wide geographical use over the EU has been shown, with centres 
in the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and a number of others. 
- The degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) 
There is continued scientific interest in lutetium, with publications spanning 15 years and at least 25 publications 
a year since 2005. 
- Coherence of scientific assessments 
The comprehensive body of data and discussion by the applicant fulfilled the requirements of the 
well-established use legal basis, not only in length of use but also quantity and extent. 
b) The CHMP considers that the documentation submitted by the Applicant has covered all aspects of the quality, 
safety and efficacy and includes review of the relevant literature. The documentation, both favourable and 
unfavourable has been communicated. 
c) The CHMP considers that adequate justifications and/or analyses have been provided by the applicant to 
complete any missing information, demonstrating that an acceptable level of safety and efficacy can be 
supported although some studies are lacking. 
d) The Applicant explained the relevance of data submitted concerning the product reviewed in the literature 
being different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement has been made that the product studied 
in the literature, which are mostly related to studies with carriers radiolabelled with 177Lu, are considered 
relevant to the radioprecursor intended for marketing.  
e) There is no post-marketing experience with this active substance as no product containing that active 
substance has not been authorised in the Union. Monitoring of adverse events, whilst not pro-active, has been 
described in the literature in a review article dated 2012 which is comprehensive in its description of the 
described adverse events and their frequency. 
Lumark is presented as one mL of solution contains 80 GBq Lutetium (177Lu) chloride at activity reference time 
(ART), corresponding to at most a maximum of 160 microgram of Lutetium. The ART is defined as the end of 
production. Each vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 to 5 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 8 to 
400 GBq (at ART). The minimal specific activity is 500 GBq/mg Lutetium (177Lu) at the ART. The proposed 
indication is as follows: 
Lumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It is not intended for direct use in patients. This medicinal must be 
used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed for radiolabelling 
with this radionuclide. 
Lumark is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. 
Lumark is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products, which are subsequently administered by the 
approved route. 
Lumark should not be administered directly to the patient. 
For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12 of 
the SmPC. 
The radiopharmaceutical precursor solution is packaged in colourless type I glass vial of 10 mL, closed with a 
bromobutylrubber stopper and aluminium overseal.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Lumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor solution. It is not intended for direct administration to patients. This 
medicinal product must be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically 
developed for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. 
The radiopharmaceutical precursor can be prepared in a range of strengths to provide for changing hospital 
demands. These can vary according to the intended use of the product, number of patients to be treated and 
labelling agents to be used. As a result the composition is best described as following: 
One mL of solution contains 80 GBq lutetium (177Lu) chloride at activity reference time (ART), corresponding to 
at most a maximum of 160 mg of lutetium. The ART is defined as the end of production. Each vial contains a 
volume varying from 0.1 to 5 mL corresponding to an activity ranging from 8 to 400 GBq (at ART). The minimal 
specific activity is 500 GBq/mg lutetium (177Lu) at the ART.  
Lutetium (177Lu) has a half-life of 6.647 days and is produced by neutron irradiation of enriched lutetium (176Lu). 
Lutetium (177Lu) decays by β--emission to stable hafnium (177Hf), with the most abundant β- (79.3%) having a 
maximum  energy  of  0.497  MeV.  Low  gamma  energy  is  also  emitted,  for  instance  at  113  keV (6.2%)  and 
208 keV (11%). 
Other ingredients are hydrochloric acid (0.05 N) and water for injections.  
The  radiopharmaceutical  precursor  solution  is  packaged  in  colourless  type  I  glass  vials,  closed  with  a 
bromobutylrubber stopper and aluminium overseal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of active substance is lutetium (177Lu) chloride solution (or trichloride).  177Lu is a 
beta-emitter (emax= 0,495 MeV) with a ã -component of two lines at 0.1134 and 0.208MeV. The active substance 
is a colourless or white monoclinic crystalline solid, soluble in water. 
The active substance is not isolated during the manufacture and is dissolved in a solution of diluted hydrochloric 
acid.  The general properties of the active substance therefore relate to the lutetium (177Lu) chloride in diluted 
hydrochloric acid solution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 10/53 
  
  
 
 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance 177Lu is a synthetic isotope produced in a nuclear reactor.  177Lu can be produced by two 
different routes:  
i. 
ii. 
directly by neutron bombardment of cold 176Lu 
indirectly by neutron bombardment of 176Yb to form 177Yb which decays to 177Lu;  
The 177Lu isotope is obtained by method (i) direct neutron activation of lutetium (176Lu) as the nitrate salt. 
The manufacturing process consists of three steps using commercially available a well-defined starting material 
with acceptable specifications: preparation of the target, irradiation of the target, dissolution in hydrochloric acid 
and measurement of activity. 
Characterisation is mainly by emission spectrum.  This technique shows the characteristics of the 
radionucleotides known to be present, i.e. 177Lu, 177mLu and 177mHf. Analysis data of the starting material 
lutetium oxide using ICP-MS to determine the concentration of lutetium isotopes present was also provided. The 
isotopic composition in terms of 176Lu (usually >80%) and the unwanted 175Lu (usually <20%) is presented.  The 
majority of the isotopes present in the starting material are likely to be present in the finished product as only 
a small amount will be converted to radioisotopes by bombardment.   
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis.  
Specification 
Other than measuring activity no tests are performed on the active substance. 
The active substance is not isolated during the manufacture and is dissolved in a solution of diluted hydrochloric 
acid.  The activity of the solution is measured but apart from this no other controls are performed.  The Guideline 
on radiopharmaceuticals (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007) states that: ”Where an active substance is not 
isolated during the production process, information on specification may presented in the Drug Product 
Specification(s)”.  Therefore the absence of testing in the specification for the active substance is acceptable. 
Stability 
The active substance is not isolated during the manufacture and is dissolved in a solution of diluted hydrochloric 
acid.  The activity of the solution is measured but apart from this no other controls are performed.  The Guideline 
on radiopharmaceuticals (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/306970/2007) states that ”where an active substance is not 
isolated during the production process, information on specification may presented in the Drug Product 
Specification”. Therefore the absence of testing in the specification for the active substance is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to produce a sterile finished product with a low content of metallic 
impurities, to ensure the intended performance of the product is of appropriate quality to deliver the intended 
radio-labelling capacity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 11/53 
  
  
 
 
The active substance is a bulk solution of lutetium (177Lu) solution supplied in 0.05 M HCl. This is diluted with 0.1 
N HCl to obtain a radioactive concentration of 100 GBq/mL at the date of manufacture. 
The excipients used are HCl and water for injections.  HCl was chosen because of its use in the synthesis of the 
active substance and because 177Lu is present in the ionic form of Lu+, which has very high stability in aqueous 
solutions. HCl is a well known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph Eur standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
The manufacturing process is a straightforward process starting with the bulk solution of the active substance 
and preparation to finished product in a shielded computer-assisted dispensing unit. The bulk solution is diluted 
to the required volume and dispensed into vials with each vial having its specific radioactivity and volume. The 
final step involves sterilisation and packaging into a shielded lead container. 
The sterilisation process is primarily controlled parametrically and by the use of a microbiological indicator. 
After radioactive decay, a test for sterility is performed with the same microbiological limit as would be applied 
to other parenteral dosage forms according to ICH guidelines. No process for removal of bacterial endotoxins is 
carried out before testing. 
The radiopharmaceutical precursor solution is packaged in colourless type I 10 mL glass vials, closed with a 
bromobutylrubber stopper and aluminium overseal.  The material complies with Ph Eur and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: dilution, dispensing, sterilisation and packaging. 
The finished product is prepared in a robotic dispensing line for vials with a computer-assisted unit. The 
dispensing line is placed in a clean room facility (Grade C) in which an isolator consisting of 3 hot cells, is 
positioned. These hot cells separately host the bulk manufacturing unit and a  dispense & sterilization unit 
(Grade B), delivering the injection vials ready for packaging and shipment. A third unit is situated in between 
and serves as a transfer unit. 
The dispensing unit is located in a radiation shielded laminar flow unit (class B at rest). The product is terminally 
sterilised according to an accelerated cycle shown to be at least equivalent to the standard sterilisation cycle of 
the Ph Eur. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
labelling, volumetric activity, specific activity, pH (potentiometry), radio nucleotide identification (identity 177Lu, 
gamma spectroscopy), chloride test, radionuclidic impurities (gamma spectroscopy), radiochemical purity 
(TLC), and endotoxins (Ph Eur). Sterility (Ph Eur) is used as post release test and it will be determined after 
decay (10 weeks). 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 12/53 
  
  
Batch analysis results are provided for six production batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three batches representative of that intended for routine production was provided. The product 
was packed in a container closure system that is identical to the intended commercial packaging and which 
includes vial (primary packaging), lead pot and plastic container. This was placed in an incubator set at 30 oC 
monitored using calibrated temperature sensors. No accelerated stability data is presented.  This is accepted as 
given the nature of the product and its very short shelf-life, accelerated data would not be expected to yield any 
useful information.  Samples were tested for appearance, pH-value (potentiometry), identity (177Lu, gamma 
spectroscopy), chloride test, 177mLu impurity, other radioisotope impurities, radiochemical impurities (TLC), 
endotoxins (Ph Eur) and sterility (Ph Eur). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The shelf-life of the product is 8 days. The shelf-life is limited by radioactive decay and increase in radionuclide 
impurities relative to active ingredient nuclide.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. In terms of posology, the quantity of Lumark required for 
radiolabelling and the quantity of the product to be radiolabelled with Lutetium(177Lu) that is subsequently 
administered will depend on the medicinal product to be radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical sections of the dossier have been compiled from published literature and the applicant has 
stated that administration of such a low quantity of an inorganic salt does not warrant further non-clinical 
testing.  No new non-clinical studies have been presented in this submission. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacological properties of Lutetium was first described 60 years ago1 . These studies demonstrated that 
there were no pharmacological effects with lutetium in cats dosed up to 10 mg/kg.  At higher doses of 20 mg/kg 
and above, there were signs of transient hypotension of 10 to 15 mmHg with a concomitant decrease in 
peripheral blood flow.  Complete cardiovascular collapse coupled with respiratory paralysis, was produced by 20 
mg/kg in five animals and by 40 mg/kg in the other five.  Respiration was not affected by the compound.  
Terminal electrocardiographic changes included inversion of the QRS-complex, ventricular fibrillation, heart 
block, and alterations in T-wave.  Within the dosage range employed, lutetium chloride had no effect on the 
pharmacological responses to acetylcholine, histamine or vagal stimulation.  Lutetium had no effect on 
transmission in the superior cervical ganglion or on contraction of the nictitating membrane.  None of the above 
effects of lutetium chloride could be modified by atropinisation, and the cardiovascular collapse was not 
counteracted by adrenaline. In isolated rabbit ileum, concentrations ranging from 0.4 – 1.6 mg/ml lutetium 
trichloride were required to produce depression of the intestinal tonus and contractibility.  This depressant effect 
counteracted the spasmogenic effect of both acetylcholine and nicotine.  A similar depression also occurred with 
the Trendelenburg guinea pig enteric ganglia preparation, where blockade of the circular and longitudinal 
muscular contractions were observed with a similar concentration range.  Although this would seem to indicate 
that lutetium trichloride had ganglionic blocking properties, considering the earlier findings described in cats, 
where lutetium was unable to block the cat superior cervical ganglion preparation, such activity is unlikely. 
In another study2 aortic smooth muscle strips, isolated from rabbit hearts, were incubated in the presence of 1.5 
mM Lu3+.  These strips demonstrated changes in the maximal height of the tension response, changes in the 
area under the recorded tension curves as well as inhibition of the contractile response to noradrenaline.  
Increased time of exposure to Lu3+ before addition of noradrenaline resulted in a greater inhibition of the tension 
response.  The uptake of 45Ca in such aortic strips showed a marked decrease when 1.5 mM Lu3+ was present in 
the bathing medium.  This concentration (approx. 0.4 mg/ml) compares well with the results presented above 
but these concentration are still well in excess of the usual concentration of lutetium trichloride in Lumark i.e. 20 
μg/ml.  These effects reducing calcium uptake are attributed to the competing affinity of lutetium ions for 
superficial calcium binding sites. 
Cellular studies with lutetium have demonstrated that lutetium trichloride has some limited pharmacological 
activity at concentrations below those shown in the ex vivo studies above.  Histamine release from rat peritoneal 
mast cells, caused by various releasing agents, was inhibited by concentrations as low as 10-6 M lutetium 3.  It 
is thought that the inhibition is mediated by antagonising the binding of calcium to superficial receptors on the 
mast cell membrane, presumably followed by internalisation of the lutetium ion.  Different calcium-receptors 
and channels may be involved according to the nature of the secretagogue.  It is also noted that the proposed 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 14/53 
  
  
patient dose of 20 μg lutetium trichloride, considering a human distribution volume of 75 L, would represent 
0.27 μg/L equal to a concentration of approximately 10-9 M, and a dose below the concentration that may cause 
a pharmacological effect. 
On the biochemical level the Lu3+ ion has appeared to be a potent inhibitor of the NAD(P)+-dependent human 
malic enzyme and the NADP+-dependent malic enzyme from the pigeon liver4 .  These enzymes, which catalyse 
the reversible oxidative carboxylation of l-malate to yield CO2 and pyruvate, with concomitant reduction of 
NADP+ to NADPH, require the presence of divalent cations (magnesium, calcium and others).  The lutetium ions 
compete with these divalent cations for their binding sites on the enzyme in a concentration above 10 μM (10-6 
M).  A similar competition with calcium ions underlies the main toxicological effect of lutetium trichloride. 
In vivo animal tumour models 
The shorter β-range of 177Lu provides better irradiation of small tumors, in contrast to the longer β-range of 90Y 
which allows more uniform irradiation in large tumors that may show heterogeneous uptake. This was illustrated 
in an animal model, in which a combination of 90Y- and 177Lu-labelled somatostatin analogues demonstrated a 
better tumor response than the use of each radiolabelled analogue separately5 . 
Miao et al (2007)6 examined the therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu-DOTA-Re(Arg(11))CCMSH in the B16/F1 murine 
melanoma-bearing mouse model. Results revealed that 177Lu-DOTA-Re(Arg(11))CCMSH yielded quantitative 
therapeutic effects in B16/F1 melanoma-bearing mice and appeared to be a promising radiolabelled peptide for 
the targeted radionuclide therapy of melanoma. 
Treatment with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues is a promising new tool in the management of patients 
with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumours. Symptomatic improvement may occur with 
177Lu-labelled somatostatin analogues that have been used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). 
The results obtained with 177Lu-[DOTA0, Tyr3]octreotate (DOTATATE) are very encouraging in terms of tumor 
regression7. 
Dalmo et al (2012)8 evaluated the medullary thyroid carcinoma GOT2 animal model by analyzing the 
biodistribution of 177Lu-octreotate and 111In-minigastrin (MG0). BALB/c nude mice, subcutaneously transplanted 
with GOT2, were intravenously injected with either 177Lu-octreotate or 111In-MG0, with or without excess of 
unlabeled human minigastrin simultaneously with 111In-MG0. For both radiopharmaceuticals the highest activity 
concentrations were found in the kidneys. The GOT2 animal model was considered as a valuable model for 
evaluation and optimization of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures using radiolabelled somatostatin, CCK2 
and gastrin analogues prior to clinical studies.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has not submitted studies with Lumark.  A literature review has been carried out to illustrate the 
pharmacokinetic behaviour of lutetium. The data reported concern both oral and parenteral administration and 
elucidate the characteristics of tissue distribution. 
Absorption  
Absorption of lutetium trichloride from the gastro-intestinal tract have been described from studies aimed at 
determining the feasibility of its use as non-absorbed marker for recovery, passage and indirect apparent 
digestibility studies9.  Rats were starved overnight and then were fed rice containing 25 μg lutetium after which 
complete collections of faeces and urine by 24 hours periods were made for 7 days.  The recovery of this marker 
fed as a single dose provided information on the time of passage through the alimentary tract, the quantity 
passed each day, the rate of passage and the total recovery.  These experiments showed 78% of the lutetium 
to be recovered the first day and 99% cumulatively in the first 2 days.  The missing 1% was indistinguishable 
from the background at the analytical limits of sensitivity.  When incorporated into various diets at a 
concentration ranging from 0.11 – 0.14 μg/g diet, negligible diurnal variation in faecal concentration was noted 
with lutetium.  
A similar negligible absorption, less than 0.1%, from the gastrointestinal tract had been demonstrated for some 
other lanthanides such as cerium, europium, terbium and thulium as citrate salt10.   
Distribution 
Distribution studies have been performed to determine their affinity with particular tumour types.  Some early 
work has been described in Yoshida sarcoma bearing rats in which 177Lutetium citrate was seen to be retained 
predominantly to the blood, liver, spleen, tumour and kidney.  No data was presented for bone tissue in this 
study, however further work using Ehrlich’s tumour bearing mice showed that lutetium was also retained to 
bone tissue11, 12 .  The retention values in various tissues, expressed as a per cent of the administered dose per 
gram tissue weight are shown in the table below.

% dose/g tissue weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 16/53 
  
  
 
Distribution to bone tissue has been described as a method of displacing or replacing calcium ions with lutetium 
ions in bone tissue13 .  Skeletal uptake also seems to be determined by whether lutetium is present with a carrier 
or not.  Skeletal retention is higher without a carrier (55%) than with a carrier (25%), although this addition of 
carrier also leads to increased liver uptake.  High skeletal uptake is also implied in increasing the incidence of 
osteosarcoma.  Further distribution studies confirmed high distribution of lutetium to the liver, spleen and bone 
– in total around 80% - and this didn’t vary with concentration of lutetium administered.  Distribution of lutetium 
was 65% in the liver, 5.3% in the spleen and 13% in the bones 24 hours after administration, and in addition 
there is distribution to the blood – approximately 15% 2 hours after administration14 . 
In a distribution study in mice bearing small cell lung cancer, 177Lutetium trichloride was shown to accumulate 
in the bone over 7 days, as well as have high distribution to the liver and spleen and kidney.   
A more detailed study of the biodistribution of 177Lutetium trichloride in mice confirms the relatively high uptake 
in the liver, kidneys and bone marrow15 .  The results are presented in the table below.

Biodistribution 
Four new biodistribution studies have been carried out after ICRP-30 data were published, covering the 
biodistribution of free (unlabelled) 177Lu.   
This new biodistribution data was used to make new radiation dose estimations (see dosimetry in clinical 
section).  The applicant has used a staggered approach to address this concern, this includes: 
1. Assessment of existing published literature to available on biodistribution of free Lu3+ or LuCl3.  
2. Estimation of biodistribution of free Lu3+ in mice/rats.  
3. Calculation of absorbed dose per unit activity administered, based on biodistribution parameters.  
4. Estimation of total effective dose.  
The following publications have been used to estimate biodistribution of lutetium in mice and rats:

Information from all four articles has been used to construct a new dose estimation assessment and compare it 
with the original ICRP-30 data. 
Estimation of biodistribution of free Lu3+ in mice/rats 
An overview of the results of the Lu biodistribution studies was presented in the table below. The variability of 
reported biodistribution parameter values is most probably the result of the differences in study objects (mice or 
rats, tumour or non-tumour bearing) and by the difference in focus of the respective studies. Some 
commonalities can be seen from the data: 
• Short-term uptake in liver and kidney 
• Long-term uptake in bone tissue

Assessment report

The biodistribution data is used to calculate the mean residence time of activity in organs, utilising the following 
sequence:  
• For each organ with measured 177Lu uptake, the radioactive concentration is plotted against time after 
injection.  In Figure 1, the results of this exercise are shown for 8 of the most common organs.  
• A function was fitted through these data points.  This was either a one phase decay curve, a build-up curve 
(uptake and excretion curve), or a time independent curve, depending on whichever resulted in the best fit, as 
determined by the F-test.  
• The area under the curve was calculated by taking the integral of the curve over time, to estimate the 
accumulated activity Ã per gram of tissue in the organ.

Biodistribution curves for free Lu in different organs

Page 19/53 
  
  
 
From the four literature sources cited, the article from Lungu et al. (2003)16 has the most data points (13 
organs, each with 7 time points).  The curve-fitting for these data was considered to be more accurate than for 
the other data.

The accumulated activity Ã will be used to estimate radiation dose to the different (target) organs as a result of 
the activity in the different (source) organs.  This was done using the standard MIRD (Medical Internal Radiation 
Dose) model, as described in ICRP-23 and ICRP-60: 
Where D(rk) is the absorbed dose of the target region rk, ÃS the accumulated activity in source region rh and 
S(rk←rh) called the S factor, is the mean absorbed dose to the target region rk per unit of accumulated activity 
in the source region rh. 
The S-factor represents the physical decay characteristics of the radionuclide, the range of the emitted 
radiations and the organ size and configuration.

Excretion 
After intramuscular administration, rare earth elements ions have been reported to be excreted both by the 
kidney and by the liver via the gastrointestinal tract.  The relative importance of either excretion route for any 
given element of the series is dependent upon its position in the series10.  More than 50% of the administered 
dose of the lighter lanthanides is accumulated by the liver, and is thereafter rapidly excreted in the faeces.  The 
heavier elements, including lutetium, are excreted primarily by the kidney; for thulium the percentages were 
25% via the urine and 8% through the faeces, 16 days after intramuscular injection in rats. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical studies in toxicology but a review of the literature of the toxicity of the 
inorganic active ingredient in mice, rats and dogs after administration of lutetium nitrates, oxides and salts. No 
data on chronic toxicity was submitted, however, long term effects of skeletal uptake of 177Lu have been 
described in publications. 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity of rare earth nitrates and oxides was first described in a series of experiments conducted in 1963 
in mice and rats19 .  This included lutetium nitrate which revealed LD50 values of 290 mg/kg in mice and 335 
mg/kg in rats.  Most of the mice that were acutely poisoned became depressed within an hour after injection.  
Death usually occurred within the first 24 hours and post-mortem examination of randomly selected animals 
showed generalised peritonitis with adhesions and accumulation of some ascetic fluid.   Very few of the rats that 
received lethal doses died during the first 8 days and the majority succumbed during the period from 10 to 25 
days after injection.  Almost all the rats that died during this period had grossly distended abdomens, and 
oedema of the limbs was observed in many of the animals that received the higher doses.  Gross pathologic 
examination of the animals revealed an inflammatory condition in the peritoneal cavity with massive adhesions 
and accumulation of haemorrhagic ascetic fluid.  This study also demonstrated the intraperitoneal toxicity of the 
various rare earth elements to be of the same magnitude. 
Acute oral toxicity of the various rare earth elements in rats requires even higher doses up to approximately 3 
g/kg but lutetium salt was not included in this series of experiments.  Likewise the acute intravenous toxicity of 
a series of rare earth nitrates in rats showed LD50 – values to lie in the range of 30 – 60 mg/kg.  These studies 
did suggest that the intravenous toxicity of the ionic compounds of the rare earth elements would decrease with 
atomic weight resulting lutetium being the least toxic of the series. 
Similar high doses were required to induce toxicological effects in the anaesthetised dog20.  10 mg/kg of 
lutetium trichloride, or any other rare earth metal chloride, administered intravenously at ten-minute intervals 
for a total of ten doses, resulted in varying effects on the blood pressure ranging from no effect in some dogs to 
a transient decrease variable in amplitude (5 - 20 mmHg) from animal to animal.  Likewise a decrease in heart 
rate was observed although in some occasional animals there was an increase.  Electrocardiograms showed no 
irregularities in cardiac rhythm or conduction.  Effects on respiration were slight and variable.  Chlorides 
appeared more toxic than citrates or edetates, with 15 of 45 dogs treated with chlorides not surviving the 
three-hour experimental period, but no marked gross differentiating changes were found on necropsy and 
histopathological examination of the tissues demonstrated no evidence of acute damage resulting from the 
experimental procedure.  This study showed a decreasing toxicity with increasing atomic weight. 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 22/53 
  
  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Various amounts of 177Lu as citrate were injected intraperitoneally in mice, containing 25 μg/kg stable lutetium 
per kg bodyweight as carrier in one series and 2 mg stable Lu per kg in the second series21 .   The percent of 
injected activity as present in the skeleton decreased from 60% to 34% with the higher dose carrier while the 
percent in the liver increased from 1.5% to 6%.  Autoradiography experiments of the lumbar vertebra 
demonstrated pronounced activity along the bone surfaces of the spongiosa.  The pattern of hepatic disposition 
showed diffuse small grains as well as hot spots. 
No specific chronic toxicity studies are presented with lutetium.  The only study data provided relate to the 
investigations of long term skeletal uptake of 177Lutetium in mice.  This study was performed to examine the 
incidence of osteosarcomas thought to be related to extended accumulation of lutetium to the bone tissue.  Five 
experimental groups and one control group each with about 50 animals were given increasing doses of 177Lu 
(185 – 740 MBq/kg). The table below represents the data obtained. 
Table 6: 
Incidences of osteosarcomas and latency periods in dependence on injected 
activities into mice 
A further increase of the dose to 1480 MBq/kg led to severe dental lesions, resulting in substantial underweight 
and subsequent elimination from the experiments leading to non-conclusive results for this dose level.  
With respect to the location of the osteosarcoma’s, most of the tumours appeared in the long bones and 
vertebrae (each 37%) with lower percentages in the pelvis (19%) and ribs (4%). 
Genotoxicity 
The applicant did not submit data on the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of lutetium trichloride.  There is no 
data directly described for genotoxicity with lutetium trichloride.  Evidence was presented in which levels of 
naturally occurring lutetium in freshwater plants and invertebrates (10 μg/kg lutetium in freshwater 
invertebrates) exceed the anticipated tissue concentrations resulting from the quantity of lutetium obtained in 
a single dose of Lumark (0.25 μg/kg).  Therefore, the therapeutic doses of Lumark do not result in any 
genotoxicity.   
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit data on carcinogenicity with lutetium trichloride.  Carcinogenicity in the form of 
osteosarcomas associated with 177Lu administration has been presented in the repeat toxicity section above. 
The risk is related to excessive distribution and accumulation to bone tissue.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant did not submit data on reproduction toxicity (see non-clinical discussion). 
Toxicokinetic data 
The applicant did not submit data on toxicokinetics (see non-clinical discussion). 
Local Tolerance  
The applicant did not submit data on local tolerance (see non-clinical discussion). 
Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities 
Possible related-impurities are present as elemental impurities or as radionuclidic impurities.  The major 
impurities are silicon and calcium, which are consequently below the 0.2% (w/w) in the lutetium target solution.  
All other elemental impurities are below the 0.02% threshold level which is lower than the 0.05% reporting 
threshold following the guideline Q3A on Impurities in new drug substances. 
Radiotoxicity 
Some experimental data concerning the radiotoxicity of 177Lu in mice were reported by22 . Overall data indicate 
that even large quantities of 177Lu-radioactivity can be safely administered, Lumark is contraindicated in 
established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity 
This screening is required for substances with a logKow > 4.5. However, since lutetium trichloride, the active 
ingredient of Lumark, is an inorganic salt its logKow will by all means be negative. 
Therefore no screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity for Lumark will be necessary. 
Predicted Environmental Calculation 
The predicted environmental concentration for a given medicinal product needs to be calculated using the 
following formula: 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 24/53 
  
  
The maximum dose of Lumark i.e. lutetium trichloride will amount to 20 μg and such a dose will be given with 
a few weeks intervals.  Using this value a PECsurfacewater is calculated to be 0.1 ng/l, falling below the action 
limit of 0.01 µg/l.  A Phase II assessment is therefore not deemed necessary.   
The Expert has stated that concentrations of lutetium in surface waters worldwide have previously been 
reviewed (Weltje, 2003) with figures varying from 0.25 pmol/l to 5.5 pmol/l.  This would correspond to lutetium 
chloride concentrations equal to 70 – 1545 pg/l based on its molecular weight of 281.  The predicted 
environmental concentration of lutetium resulting from the administration of Lumark is of a similar magnitude as 
the concentration already present in the environment. 
Concerns for radiation waste management 
Lumark is indicated for use in hospital patients only. This means that administration and the related patient care 
will take place within nuclear medicine departments that are equipped with the infrastructure to contain the 
presence of radioactive substances as well as to protect health care professionals and the environment against 
any radiation damage resulting from such presence.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant submitted an application under Art. 10a – well established use. The applicant submitted literature 
data on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of lutetium, which is acceptable under the proposed 
legal basis.  A number of pharmacology studies from the literature have been presented that demonstrate a 
limited pharmacological effect of lutetium trichloride.  Studies include a number of ex vivo studies with isolated 
organs – rabbit ileum and rabbit heart, in vivo study in cats, and a number of in vitro studies. 
The inorganic nature in general and the trivalent nature of the lutetium ion in particular governed the 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of lutetium trichloride. This nature predicts a low absorption after oral 
administration as well as the absence of metabolic pathways. There is only limited absorption data with lutetium.  
When lutetium was administered in feed to rats, 99% was recovered over 48 hours.  This finding of negligible 
absorption via the gastro intestinal tract was confirmed in a second study with other similar lanthanides.  The 
information on metabolism of lutetium was limited to literature that indicated that transport of inorganic salt 
ions were mainly taken up by the liver before biliary excretion.   
Pharmacokinetics of Lutetium (177Lu) was investigated in rats and mice. The distribution and mineral 
concentrations in the organs were investigated at low (9-10 mg/kg) and high (19-20 mg/kg) doses 
administered intravenously to rats. It appeared that more than 78% of the doses was distributed into liver, bone 
and spleen. For Lutetium (177Lu) the different dose levels did not result in significantly different uptake 
with 65% appearing in the liver, 5.3% in the spleen and 13% in the bones at one day after administration.  
With respect to the distribution pattern in blood it appeared that 2 h after administration 15% of the Lutetium as 
being present in blood, had entered the blood cells with the remaining 85% still being present in the serum. 
A more detailed study of the biodistribution of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride in mice confirms the relatively high 
uptake in the liver, kidneys and bone marrow The results indicated that lutetium (177Lu) chloride is accumulated 
in the bone marrow and emphasizes the importance of all Lutetium (177Lu) to be peptide-bound at injection, as 
well as the in-vivo stability of the radionuclide-chelate-complex during therapy.Distribution studies were 
performed in Yoshida sarcoma bearing rats in which 177Lutetium citrate was seen to be retained predominantly 
to the blood, liver, spleen, tumour and kidney.  No data was presented for bone tissue, however further work 
using Ehrlich’s tumour bearing mice showed that lutetium was also retained to bone tissue.  Lutetium retention 
in bone was found to be lower when it was added to a carrier (25%) than without a carrier (55%).  In a 
distribution study in mice bearing small cell lung cancer, 177Lutetium trichloride was shown to accumulate in the 
bone over 7 days, as well as have high distribution to the liver and spleen and kidney.  The increasing incidence 
of osteosarcoma implies a high skeletal uptake.  Distribution of lutetium was 65% in the liver, 5.3% in the spleen 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 26/53 
  
  
 
 
 
and 13% in the bones 24 hours after administration, and in addition there is distribution to the blood – 
approximately 15% 2 hours after administration.  The excretion of lutetium appears to be mainly via the kidney 
(25%), followed by faecal excretion (8%).   
The multitude of animal biodistribution data available in the literature forms the basis of the applicant’s 
justification for dosimetry.   
There are no literature data submitted to describe pharmacokinetic drug interactions. This is acceptable Lumark 
is a precursor to be used for in vitro radiolabelling of carrier molecules and is not directly injected in patients. 
At the concentration present in Lumark, lutetium trichloride appears to have no pharmacological action.  
Therefore, it is acceptable not to submit additional pharmacodynamic data. 
With respect to the intrinsic toxicity of lutetium trichloride, as Lumark is intended for use as a single dose of 
10-20 μg (approx. 0.25 μg/kg), the levels of intake are below the threshold stated in the ‘Guideline on the limits 
of genotoxic impurities’ (EMA/CHMP/SWP431994/2007 Rev. 3), in which the Threshold of Toxicological Concern 
(TTC) for an exposure of 3 months is a maximum allowable daily intake of 20 μg per day, i.e. a total intake of 
1800 μg during this period. 
No data on animal toxicity studies were submitted with Lumark. The toxicity of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride has 
been studied in different mammals and using different administration routes. Intraperitoneal administration 
resulted in generalized peritonitis with adhesion and accumulation of some ascetic fluid. By intraperitoneal 
route, the LD50 is approximately 300 mg/kg in mice and rats. By intravenous route, the LD50 in rats and mice 
ranges between 30 and 60 mg/kg. Intravenously administrated doses resulted in varying effects on the blood 
pressure and a decreased heart rate. Electrocardiograms showed no irregularities in cardiac rhythm or 
conduction. Effects of the respiration were slight and variable. No gross differentiating changes were found of 
the tissues demonstrating no evidence of acute damage resulting from the experiment. The studies suggest that 
the intravenous toxicity of the ionic compounds of the rare earth elements would decrease with atomic weight 
resulting in Lutetium (177Lu) being the least toxic of the series. Its main risk derives from the emission of energy 
β radiations. 
No data on chronic toxicity studies were submitted with Lumark.  The only study data provided relate to the 
investigations of long term skeletal uptake of 177Lu in mice.  This study was performed to examine the incidence 
of osteosarcomas thought to be related to extended accumulation of lutetium to the bone tissue.  The data 
showed that the level of skeletal uptake increased with increasing dose of 177Lu and latency period also seemed 
to decrease with increasing dose. To further combat this feature of lutetium toxicity, further investigations 
designed to chelate small molecules to radioactive lutetium have been presented.  The evidence suggests that 
when combined with diethylene triaminepentetate (DTPA), the extent of skeletal uptake is greatly diminished, 
so much so that in rats un-chelated 177LuCl3 demonstrated skeletal retention of 80%, but when 0.5 μg DTPA was 
added to the injection the body retention was reduced to 4%.  Further retention work using rat femur 
demonstrated a similar reduction in skeletal uptake.  It has been explained that the formation of the 177Lu- DTPA 
complex may initiate rapid renal clearance of free 177Lu3+, therefore reducing the potential for accumulation.  
Therefore, information on the risk of osteosarcoma and precautions to use DTPA prior to intravenous 
administration of 177Lu-labeled conjugates are included in the RMP as a potential safety concern and have been 
addressed in the SmPC section 4.9 and 12. A statement is included in the SmPC (section 12) that the amount of 
free Lu-ions should be maintained as low as possible to avoid unnecessary accumulation of 177Lu in the bone: 
“Free 177LuCl3 is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in osteosarcomas. It is 
recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration of 177Lu-labeled 
conjugates in order to form a complex with free 177Lu, if present, leading to a rapid renal clearance of 177Lu. “ 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 27/53 
  
  
The risk of genotoxicity is considered low at therapeutic doses of Lumark and it is assumed that is does not result 
in any genotoxicity.  Carcinogenicity in the form of osteosarcomas associated with 177Lu administration was 
discussed – the risk is related to excessive distribution and accumulation to bone tissue has been identified as 
a potential safety concern in the RMP. Therefore, the lack of further genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data is 
acceptable. 
The applicant has not submitted data from the literature for reproductive toxicity with lutetium.  The lack of 
reproductive toxicity data was acceptable, given the known concerns over the exposure of the foetus to ionising 
radiation. Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of 
cancer and mutations. Therefore, the use of Lumark during pregnancy is contraindicated, and patients are 
advised to not breastfeed should they be administered Lumark.   
The applicant did not submit data in juvenile animals. This is acceptable as 177Lu-labelled medicinal products 
should not be used in children and adolescents up to 18 years. 
No data has been provided to support any conclusions on female or male fertility.  This has been reflected in 
section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The applicant did not submit data on local tolerance. This was acceptable given the single use of Lumark. 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) report stated that the active substance in Lumark, lutetium 
trichloride, would provide a negative value for Logkow and so an assessment for persistence, bioaccumulation 
and toxicity (PBT) was unnecessary.  The CHMP agrees with this assessment and that no further examination of 
PBT was necessary.  The PECsurfacewater based upon a maximum daily dose of 20 µg, gives a value that is 
below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. With respect to 
the radioactive environmental impact of Lumark, it is important to highlight that 177Lutetium is a radioisotope 
with a relatively short half-life (6.7 days) which contribute significantly to a relative short-lasting environmental 
impact of the product. Therefore lutetium trichloride is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There is no general concern over the toxicity of the lutetium in this preparation, as the amount of 177lutetium is 
below the threshold of the maximum allowable daily intake of 20 μg per day and therefore is unlikely to be toxic.  
The main concern related to the development of osteosarcoma and its latency observed in mice studies. The risk 
has been addressed in the RMP as a potential safety concern and in the SmPC, which includes recommendations 
on the addition of DTPA prior to intravenous administration of 177Lu labelled ligands. 
No supplementary animal studies are needed because safety issues can adequately be evaluated from the 
literature and considering that single and repeated dose toxicity studies will be provided for the carrier medicinal 
products using the 177 Lutetium radiolabel. 
For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the non-clinical aspects of Lumark 
have been adequately addressed.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application submitted under the legal basis of Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, well-established 
use. The applicant has justified this with evidence of the first diagnostic and therapeutic use of 177Lu being over 
a decade ago in Europe and provided further evidence to support an increase over the years in the use of this 
product as a radiolabel. Lumark is not intended for direct administration to patients. The solution is intended for 
the labelling of peptides or proteins which subsequently are administered to patients. A brief literature overview 
is presented on the various applications of different peptides and monoclonals, labelled with 177Lu.

No clinical pharmacology studies were submitted with this application (see clinical pharmacology discussion). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical pharmacology studies were submitted with this application (see clinical pharmacology discussion). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The lack of clinical pharmacology studies is considered acceptable. The pharmacokinetics of a 
radiopharmaceutical would be dependent on the carrier molecule labelled with Lumark.  The pharmacodynamics 
of a radiopharmaceutical would also be dependent on the carrier molecule and on the method of conjugation 
used to link it to the radioisotope.   
The applicant provided a discussion on the event of a failed labelling or a complete dissociation.  The resulting 
amount of free 177Lutetium circulating in the body will be extremely low and equivalent to approximately 0.25 
μg/kg. No pharmacological or toxicological effects will result from such a low quantity as has been demonstrated 
in animal experiments. The applicant provided evidence that when attached to a ligand that the conjugate is 
stable over many hours.   
The applicant has provided a discussion to justify the low likelihood of the presence of free 177lutetium in the 
body, following administration of a 177lutetium labelled radiopharmaceutical. This is based on the 
administration of an extremely low quantity (approximately 0.25µg/kg) of an inorganic salt such as lutetium 
trichloride, which is considered to have negligible effect on PK and PD parameters. 
No interaction studies of Lutetium (177Lu) with other medicinal products have been performed. The possible use 
of chelating therapies could interfere with the use of Lutetium(177Lu)-labeled medicinal products. 
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the radiolabelled medicinal product. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Lumark will be dependent on the carrier molecule and on the method of conjugation 
used to link it to the radionuclide. The relevant clinical pharmacology data with Lumark will have to be submitted 
separately with the application for the different carrier molecules. Thus, the lack of studies in pharmacology for 
this application is acceptable. For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the 
clinical pharmacology of Lumark has been adequately addressed.

2.5.1.  Clinical Utility 
The applicant submitted clinical data from the literature to support the clinical utility of Lumark or 177Lu 
trichloride radionuclide in treatment of neuroendocrine tumours, breast cancer, bone metastases, glioblastoma 
and in the management of advanced prostate cancer. 
177Lu as a radiopharmaceutical for neuroendocrine tumors 
The  applicant  states  that  the  most  widely  investigated  application  and  also  the  oldest  use  of  177Lu  is  in 
neuroendocrine  tumour  therapy.  In  a  review  article  of  nuclear  medicine  techniques  for  the  imaging  and 
treatment of neuroendocrine tumours by23 , it states that preclinical experiments with 177Lu coupled to dotatate 
were started in 2002 and demonstrated the highest tumour uptake together with excellent tumour-to-kidney 
ratios compared with 111In – labelled octreotide or 177Y – labelled dotatate24 .  
In the same review article, it further states that the first reports on the results of the clinical use of  177Lu – 
Dotatate  published  by  Kwekkeboom  et  al  (2003) 25  were  promising  with  30%  of  the  patients  with 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) showing partial or complete remission, 40 % of the 
patients showing stable disease and only 12% of the patients showing minimal response. A more recent analysis 
by Kwekkeboom et al. (2008)26 confirmed these results in a group of 310 GEP-NET patients. These patients 
were treated up to a total administered activity of 28 – 30GBq, usually in four treatment cycles, with treatment 
intervals  of  6  –  10  weeks.  Complete  and  partial  tumour  remissions  occurred  in  2%  and  28%  of  patients 
respectively. Median time-to-progression in the treated GEP-NET patients who did not have progressive disease 
was 40 months from start of the first cycle. Median overall survival was 46 months and median disease-related 
survival was > 48 months. Some patients benefit from an additional salvage therapy i.e. two additional cycles 
of 7.4 GBq; in particular patients with metastasised bronchial GEP-NET’s or who had clear tumour responses or 
remissions. Published reports from other clinical centres are in line with the results obtained in this group of 310 
patients. 
As compared with (historical data of) conventional therapy for this disease (somatostatin analogues like 
octreotide), the consistent difference is at least suggestive for a better survival after 177Lu-dotatate therapy. 
A publication by Amir Sabet et al (2014)27 showed that PRRT with 177Lu-octreotate in the re-treatment setting 
is safe and effective in patients with metastatic GEP-NET.  They retrospectively analysed a consecutive cohort of 
33 patients with metastatic GEP-NET who underwent salvage peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). All 
patients had progressive NET prior to salvage treatment and had shown an initial response to PRRT. The mean 
cumulative activity was 44.3 GBq (30.0–83.7 GBq). Response was assessed using CT and/or MRI according to 
modified SWOG criteria. Toxicity was evaluated using laboratory data, including complete blood counts and 
renal function tests using CTCAE 3.0. Radiographic responses showed complete response in 1 patient (3.0 %), 
partial response in 6 patients (18.2 %), minor response in 1 patient (3.0 %), stable disease in 14 patients (42.4 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 32/53 
  
  
 
%), and progressive disease in 11 patients (33.3 %). Median progression-free survival from the start of salvage 
therapy was 13 months (95 % CI 9–18) and patients with a history of a durable PFS after initial PRRT tended to 
have long-lasting PFS after salvage treatment (p =0.04). None of the patients developed severe nephrotoxicity 
(grade 3/4) or a myelodysplastic syndrome during follow-up. Relevant albeit reversible haematotoxicity (grade 
3/4) occurred in 7 patients (21.2 %). The cumulative administered activity was not associated with an increased 
incidence of haematotoxicity. 
A publication from Romer et al. (2014)28 compared the benefits and harms of the β-emitting radionuclides 90Y 
or 177Lu.  Patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours underwent repeated cycles of (90Y-DOTA)- TOC or 
(177Lu-DOTA)-TOC in a comparative cohort study until progression of disease or permanent adverse events.  
Overall, 910 patients underwent 1,804 cycles of (90Y-DOTA)-TOC and 141 patients underwent 259 cycles of 
(177Lu-DOTA)-TOC. The median survival after (177Lu-DOTA)-TOC and after (90Y-DOTA)-TOC was comparable 
(45.5 months versus 35.9 months, hazard ratio 0.91, 95 % confidence interval 0.63–1.30, p =0.49). Subgroup 
analyses revealed a significantly longer survival for (177Lu- DOTA)-TOC over (90Y-DOTA)-TOC in patients with 
low tumour uptake, solitary lesions and extra-hepatic lesions. The rate of severe transient haematologic 
toxicities was lower after (177Lu-DOTA)-TOC treatment (1.4 vs 10.1 %, p =0.001), while the rate of severe 
permanent renal toxicities was similar in both treatment groups (9.2 vs 7.8 %, p =0.32). This study showed no 
difference in median overall survival after (177Lu-DOTA)-TOC and (90Y-DOTA)-TOC. Furthermore, 
(177Lu-DOTA)-TOC was less haematotoxic than (90Y-DOTA)-TOC. 
A publication from E. Seregni et al. (2014) 29 evaluated in a phase II study the feasibility of combined PPRT with 
a high-energy beta emitter 90Y and a medium energy beta/gamma emitter 177Lu. Patients with metastatic NET 
refractory to conventional therapy received treatment with tandem (90Y-DOTA)-TATE and (177Lu-DOTA)-TATE 
A group of 26 patients with metastatic NET were treated with four therapeutic cycles of alternating 
(177Lu-DOTA)-TATE (5.55 GBq) and (90Y-DOTA)-TATE (2.6 GBq). A dosimetric evaluation was carried out after 
administration of (177Lu-DOTA)-TATE to calculate the absorbed doses in healthy organs.  Administration of 
tandem (90Y-DOTA)-TATE and (177Lu-DOTA)-TATE induced objective responses in 42.3 % of patients with 
metastatic NET with a median progression free survival longer than 24 months. Of patients with pretreatment 
carcinoid syndrome, 90 % showed a symptomatic response or a reduction in tumour-associated pain. The 
cumulative biologically effective doses (BED) were below the toxicity limit in the majority of patients, in the 
absence of renal function impairment.   
177Lu as a radiopharmaceutical for prostate cancer 
Yao et al. (2002)30, described the potential of using monoclonal antibodies to prostate-specific antigens, in 
particular prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), as therapeutic tool in the management of advanced 
prostate cancer. One of these antibodies, J591 (IgG1) can be deimmunised eliminating the human anti-mouse 
antibody (HAMA) response while maintaining the binding specificity and affinity for PSMA. Then, using as a 
chelator for both this antibody and 177Lutetium, the resulting complex can be used as an imaging agent for 
radioimmunoscintigraphy to diagnose prostate cancer. They report that this complex has shown excellent 
targeting of prostate cancer not only in soft tissue but in bone as well, without patients developing human 
anti-humanised antibodies. 
177
The use of radiolabeled J591 antibodies in patients with prostate cancer was reviewed by David et al. (2006)31 
and both 90Yt as well as 
Lu -labeled J591 
antibodies were evaluated in 35 patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer with dose levels varying 
from 10mCi/m2 - 75 mCi/m2 and retreatment occurring at 6 – 12 weeks intervals up to a maximum of 4 
treatments.  Targeting of all known sites of prostate cancer metastases in soft tissue and bone was seen in all 
Lu has been used as radiolabel for this purpose in Phase 1 trials.

30 patients. With regard to antitumor activity, none of the 7 patients with measurable disease had an objective 
tumor response but with respect to PSA criteria, 21 patients demonstrated evidence of some response, with 4 
patients showing a > 50% PSA decrease lasting between 3 months and 8 months before returning to baseline. 
Sixteen patients have PSA stabilisations for a median of 60 days, defined as a PSA increase of < 25% from 
baseline. 
No human anti-humanised antibodies developed in these patients and the pattern of neutrophil decrease was 
not consistent. Non-haematological toxicity appeared not dose limiting but some dose limiting 
myelosuppression occurred with repeat dosing at 45-60 mCi/m2. 
177
Lu as a radiopharmaceutical for breast cancer 
The application of 177Lu in this therapeutic area is based on early work in the preclinical phase. The applicant 
has presented two publications in which it is used in this setting: 
Salouti et al. 201132: PR81 is a monoclonal antibody which binds with high affinity to MUC1 antigen that is over 
expressed in 80% of breast cancers. In this study, a method for indirect labelling of PR81 with 177Lu was 
developed. Biodistribution and scintigraphy studies in BALB/c mice with breast tumour of 177Lu coupled to the 
PR81 monoclonal antibody resulted in accumulation of the complex at the site of tumours with high sensitivity 
and specificity. The authors concluded that PR81 coupled with 177Lu may be considered as a potential 
radiopharmaceutical for therapy of human breast cancer, which needs further investigations. 
D’Huyvetter et al. 201233: In this study, a different approach has been followed while targeting the HER2 antigen 
which is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers often associated with higher recurrence rates. Such 
targeting can be obtained using nanobodies, the smallest natural antigen-binding fragments occurring from 
heavy-chain-only Camelidae antibodies, labelled with 177Lu with the use of bifunctional chelators. This approach 
showed high specific tumour uptake combined with the lowest background while no specific binding was 
observed in a HER2-negative model. 
The applicant concludes that in breast cancer, these therapies need extensive additional clinical investigation to 
validate these early results and to demonstrate comparative results in patients. 
177
Lu as a radiopharmaceutical for bone metastases 
177Lutetium-EDTMP (methylene phosphonic acid) is a beta-emitting, bone-seeking therapeutic 
radiopharmaceutical, being assessed as an agent for palliation of bone pain for disseminated skeletal 
metastases in patients with breast and prostate cancer. It can emit suitable gamma-photons for scintigraphy. 
Liu et al. 201234, sought to characterise the optimal condition for 177Lutetium-EDTMP for whole-body gamma 
camera imaging in patients. It was found to have optimal characteristics for imaging bone metabolism in 
humans using a gamma camera. Optimal results were obtained 24 hours after administration while using a 
medium-energy collimator. 
177
Lu as a radiopharmaceutical for brain tumours 
Bulte et al. 201135: This therapeutic application of 177Lu is still in its early developmental phase and includes the 
incorporation of 177Lu in a C80 fullerene (a hollow sphere molecule composed entirely of carbon atoms). These 
fullerenes can be infused intratumourally in glioblastoma (a highly invasive brain tumour with poor prognosis) 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 34/53 
  
  
and phase I, II and III trials including fullerenes loaded with cytotoxins or iodine-131-labelled monoclonal 
antibodies already have been performed but with only small gains in overall survival. It is postulated that the 
path length of 177Lu (0.04 – 1.8 mm) is particularly useful for this therapy as the extracellular metallofullerenes 
present in the interstitial fluid are still effective for eradicating tumour cells from a distance. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant did not submit analyses performed across trials.  
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
177Lu is intended to be used as a radiolabel for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. There is strong evidence 
which support the use of 177Lu in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) and some 
evidence in prostate cancer. PRRT with 177Lu radiolabelled somatostatin analogues has been widely used in 
numerous publications. 
The evidence currently available to demonstrate clinical utility of 177Lu in bone imaging,  breast cancer and brain 
tumours is still experimental.  
For the purpose of this application, it is sufficient that clinical utility in neuroendocrine tumours is 
well-established. As expected with this radiopharmaceutical precursor, no indication is claimed with this 
application. It is intended for radiolabelling of suitable carrier molecules (peptides, antibodies) which have been 
specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is the view of the CHMP that clinical utility of Lumark attached to the relevant molecular carrier has been 
demonstrated for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. According to Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, 
Annex I Part III, this is considered sufficient for the purposes of applications for radiopharmaceuticals for 
radiolabelling. Further efficacy and safety data in particular indications will be assessed during the marketing 
authorisation application for carrier molecules proposing to use Lumark as a radiolabel. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The applicant did not submit safety data in humans with Lumark since Lumark is not intended to be administered 
directly to patients.  
The safety of Lumark has been considered from two perspectives: safety relating to lutetium itself and safety 
relating to radioactivity. 
Patient exposure 
Lumark is a precursor for radiopharmaceuticals, not intended for direct administration to patients. In addition 
the quantity of the inorganic salt administered, lutetium trichloride, is too low to result in any pharmacological 
or toxicological effect in the human body. 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 35/53 
  
  
Overall Extent of Exposure 
The applicant has estimated total exposure to 177Lu based on their supply to different medical centers. The total 
extent of the exposure to Lumark is estimated at 2500 patients based on a shipped total of approx. 10,000 
patient doses and a usual treatment scheme of 4 doses per patient. 504 of these patients have been included in 
the recent review of the side effects of 177Lu-dotatate in patients with neuroendocrine tumors23 . This number 
does not include patients exposed to 177Lu-dotatate which includes 177Lu manufactured by other manufacturers 
in the USA or Europe. 
Dosimetry and biodistribution 
To calculate the dosimetry, the applicant presented the following approach: 
1. Assessment of existing published literature to available on biodistribution of free Lu3+ or LuCl3. 
2. Estimation of biodistribution of free Lu3+ in mice/rats. 
3. Calculation of absorbed dose per unit activity administered, based on biodistribution parameters. 
4. Estimation of total effective dose. 
The assessment of existing published literature on biodistribution of free Lu3+ or LuCl3, the estimation of 
biodistribution of free Lu3+ in mice/rats and the calculation of absorbed dose per unit activity administered, 
based on biodistribution parameters have been presented in the non-clinical section.  
Calculation of absorbed dose per unit activity administered, based on biodistribution parameters  
This parameter was then transposed to human organs, by assuming that the activity uptake in a human organ 
is the same as in a mouse or rat, corrected for the relative mass of that organ (related to total body weight): 
Subsequently, the mean value of accumulated activity Ã in the human organs, was used as input for the 
software OlindaEXM (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA), which calculates dose per organ and total effective 
dose (according to the weighting factors of ICRP-60), based on biodistribution and physical parameters of a 
radionuclide. The OlindaEXM software also includes the S-factors mentioned in section 2, for the most common 
radionuclides. 
The calculations were executed for both 177Lu (half-life 6,647 d) and 177mLu (half-life 160.1 d), with 177mLu 
activity content set at 0.05% (specified limit for Lumark). 
From the four literature sources cited, the article from Lungu et al. (2007)16 has the most data points (13 
organs, each with 7 time points). The curve-fitting for these data can be considered more accurate than for the 
other data. Therefore, these data were also used to execute the dosimetry calculations with OlindaEXM 
separately (only for 177Lu). 
For comparison, the dosimetry calculation was also executed (for 177Lu and 177mLu) using the ICRP-30 lutetium 
biodistribution data originally submitted with the Lumark dossier: 
• lutetium directly excreted: 37.5% in 1:1 faecal to urinary pathway ratio  
• lutetium distributed: 60% to bone, 2% to the liver, 0.5% to the kidney  
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 36/53 
  
  
 
• biological half-live in the kidney: 10 days  
• biological half-live in the bone and liver: 3500 days  
Estimation of total effective dose  
Based on this animal distribution data, the following dosimetry estimates was made, taking into account an 
energy per transformation of 0.147 MeV/transformation and when applying the following assumptions based on 
ICRP data (ICRP, 1981): 
• 
• 
37.5% of the lutetium is directly excreted 
the remainder of the lutetium is distributed to the bone, liver and kidneys (60%, 2% and 0.5% 
respectively) 
• 
lutetium is excreted from the kidneys with a biological half-life of 10 days and from the bone and liver 
with a biological half-life of 3500 days 
it is then used to calculate the effective dose per tissue using the tissue weighting factors from ICRP-60 as 
presented in the table below. 
Table 9: 
Absorbed dose per unit activity administered for various tissues16 
The radiation dose received by the various organs following administration of a Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled 
medicinal product will be dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled.  
Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the 
radiolabelled preparation will be available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
The dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated Lutetium(177Lu) 
to the radiation dose following the administration of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product or resulting 
from an accidental intravenous injection of Lumark. 
The dosimetry estimates are based on biodistribution data provided by ICRP-30, showing bone, liver and 
kidneys as the significant target organs for the biodistribution of lutetium.

Therefore, the total effective dose for 177Lu was:

• 0.21 mSv/MBq when using the biodistribution data

• 0.25 mSv/MBq when using only the data from Lungu et al (2007)16. 
The total effective dose for 177mLu, calculated using this method, amounts to 1.6% of the total effective dose 
from 177Lu, based on a 0.05% radionuclidic impurity level. 
Adverse events 
The adverse events discussed are related to the use of peptides or antibodies in general radiolabelled with 177Lu 
as Lumark is not intended to be administered on its own to patients. 
Following  therapy  with  radiolabelled  peptides  or  antibodies,  kidney  retention  and  renal  function  loss  may 
become  apparent  many  years  after  the  radiation  therapy.  The  uptake  mechanism  of  radioactivity  from 
radiolabelled peptides in the kidney is mainly tubular reabsorption of the peptide, not receptor binding, causing 
predominant  changes  in  the  arteriolar-glomerular  area,  rather  than  the  tubular  epithelium,  and  leading  to 
glomerular sclerosis. This may result in renal function loss and even end-stage renal disease. 
Prevention  of  radiation  nephropathy  from  radiolabelled  peptides  or  antibodies  is  usually  accomplished  by 
co-infusion of positively charged amino acids, in particular lysine and arginine. Typically, a renal dose reduction 
of 25% can be reached with these mixed amino acids. 
The prevention of bladder radiotoxicity can be managed through patient hydration or patient catheterisation. 
The urinary bladder is a target organ mainly for excretion mechanism and can be considered a late radiation 
toxicity due to the slow cell division rate. 
In the review article presented by Teunissen et al. (2011)23, adverse events after PRRT with 177Lu-dotatate were 
analysed  in  a  total  of  504  patients.  With  respect  to  the  most  prevalent  clinical  use  of  Lumark,  the  most 
frequently occurring side effects noted after administration of 177Lu-dotatate included nausea (25% of patients), 
vomiting (10%) and abdominal pain (10%) but these effects may also (partly) be caused by the co-infusion of 
the  renal  protective  amino  acids.  This  therapy  also  resulted  in  acute  haematological  toxicity  in  10%  of  the 
patients.  Temporary  mild  hair  loss  was  noticed  in  62%  of  the  patients.  Serious  late  toxicity  includes 
myelodysplastic syndrome in four out of the 504 patients and renal insufficiency in 2 patients and 3 patients with 
serious liver toxicity from the same cohort. 
The safety of Lumark can be considered as those relating to the radioactivity of the product and those related to 
free lutetium.

Overdose 
The applicant has stated that as Lumark will be used within hospitals only and administered by healthcare 
professionals only, this excludes any intentional overdose. Any unintentional overdose would be related to 
radiological safety aspects rather than medicinal safety aspects. However, no incidents describing such 
unintentional overdose have been described in the literature up to now. 
Laboratory findings 
The applicant did not submit laboratory data (see safety discussion). 
Safety in special populations 
As this is a radioactive medicinal product, it is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No data on safety related to drug-drug interaction was submitted (see clinical safety discussion). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No data on discontinuation due to adverse events was submitted (see clinical safety discussion). 
Post marketing experience 
No data on post-marketing experience was submitted (see clinical safety discussion). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Taking into consideration the doses of lutetium administered, it is unlikely than any toxicity would result from 
lutetium excess with the use of Lumark. The quantity of 177Lu chloride to be administered to humans, 10 - 20 μg 
equivalent to 0.15 – 0.25 μg/kg, is extremely low and lacks any pharmacological or toxicological significance. 
According to the CPMP/ICH/286/95 Guideline on safety studies for clinical trials and marketing authorizations, 
under these circumstances no additional pharmacological, general toxicity or genotoxicity studies are 
necessary. 
It is accepted that as a radiolabelling agent that Lumark will not be given on its own to subjects and that precise 
safety data on a Lumark/complex medicine will have to be supplied with such an application. To this end the use 
of the animal data from the studies presented is considered useful and then the modelling to extrapolate from 
the rodent models to humans allows for a comparison of the estimated dosimetry to the previous ICRP-30 data 
presented.  Across the studies the values and trends are similar, with kidneys and liver showing rapid clearance 
and accumulation in the bone over time. Values in other organs and tissues are relatively low. Without exposing 
human subjects to free Lutetium, this approach is acceptable. The applicant proposes to still use the dose 
estimates based on the ICRP-30 data. This is acceptable and is considered the most conservative approach.

The main safety issues to be considered in relation to 177Lu radioactivity are due to the 6-day half-life of 
and the emission of low energy gamma rays. The emission of gamma rays (113 keV, and 208 keV) is of concern 
Lu 
177
with regards to exposure to personnel preparing and administering the radiopharmaceutical as well as to 
individuals who come into contact with the patient who has received the 177Lu-labelled radiopharmaceutical.  
There is the potential risk identified of the development of osteosarcoma as 177Lu is taken up and accumulated 
in the bones. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous administration of 
177Lu-labeled conjugates in order to form a complex with free 177Lu, leading to rapid renal clearance. This has 
been adequately addressed in the SmPC section 4.9. It is expected that in centres where this radiolabel will be 
used, the necessary special precautions for disposal and other handling and preparation of radiopharmaceuticals 
would be taken into consideration to minimise radiation exposure and further guidance is provided in the SmPC 
in sections 6.6 and 12, respectively. It is not possible to describe likelihood and effect of 177Lu accumulation in 
bone or liver specifically, as this depends on the labelled compound. The amount of free Lu-ions should be 
maintained as low as possible to avoid unnecessary accumulation of 177Lu in the bone. This statement is included 
in the SmPC. 
There is a contraindication in hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1 and Pregnancy (see section 4.6). For information on contraindications to particular Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled 
medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Lumark, refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics/package leaflet of each particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
Effects on ability to drive or use machines following treatment by Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal 
product to be radiolabelled. 
Adverse reactions following the intravenous administration of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products 
prepared by radiolabelling with Lumark, will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. Such 
information is supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled.  
For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The 
activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing 
in mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result. 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary 
defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and 
mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease 
itself.  
When the precursor is bound to a carrier molecule the content of radioactive free Lutetium (177Lu) is supposed 
to be less than the stated amounts depending on the carrier used. Relevant data is included in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of the labeled medicinal products. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to 
report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered 
should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect. Lumark is not 
to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as 
monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates. 
Radiation protection  
Administration of a high activity (7.400 MBq) of the Lutetium(177Lu)-labelled medicinal product results in an 
average radiation dose rate at 1 m distance from the patient of 4-11 µSv/h after 24 hours. This is below the 
threshold considered acceptable for discharge from the clinic (20 µSv/h). For a person in the vicinity of the 
patient, assuming continuous exposure at 2 m and infinite biological half-life (no disposal by the patient after 
discharge from the hospital), this dose rate will result in an overall dose of approximately 0.6 mSv, which is 
approximately one half of the dose limit set for general public (1 mSv/year).  
Precautions with respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6.  
Women of childbearing potential  
When an administration of radioactive medicinal products to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is 
important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be assumed 
to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the woman has missed a 
period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using ionising radiation (if there are any) 
should be offered to the patient. Before the use of 177Lu -labelled medicinal products, pregnancy should be 
excluded using an adequate/validated test. 
Pregnancy 
The use of Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or suspected  
pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to 
the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased breast-feeding, and to 
what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the secretion of activity in breast 
milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding  should be interrupted and the expressed 
feeds discarded. . 
Fertility 
According to literature reports and taking a conservative approach (maximum patient dose of 10 GBq, average 
labeling yield and no additional measures), it may be considered that 177Lu-labelled medicinal products do not 
lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or genetic damage in male testes 
or female ovaries. 
Further information concerning the use of 177Lu-labelled medicinal products is specified in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
Incompatibilities 
Radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/427491/2015 
Page 42/53 
  
  
It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal 
product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for 
example non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimize trace metal impurity 
levels. 
In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with medicinal products other 
than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of Lumark can be considered as those relating to the radioactivity of the product and those related to 
free lutetium. As Lumark is intended to be administered labelled to a carrier molecule, the safety and extent of 
exposure will be dependent on the carrier molecule.  For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical 
for radiolabelling, the safety of Lumark has been adequately addressed.

medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. 
Adequate shielding is mandatory.  
The surface dose rates and the accumulated dose 
depend on many factors. Measurements on the 
location and during work are critical and should be 
practiced for more precise and instructive 
determination of overall radiation dose to the staff. 
Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of 
close contact with patients injected with 
177Lu-radiopharmaceuticals. The use of television 
monitor systems to monitor the patients is 
recommended. Given the long half-life of 177Lu it is 
specially recommended to avoid internal 
contamination. For this reason it is mandatory to use 
protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves in any 
direct contact with the radiopharmaceutical 
(vial/syringe) and with the patient. For minimising 
radiation exposure with repeated exposure there is 
no recommendation except the strict observance of 
the above ones.  
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates 
risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. 
Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken.  
Any unused product or waste material should be 
disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  
12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be 
checked. Activity may be measured using an 
ionisation chamber. Lutetium (177Lu) is a 
bèta/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using 
an ionization chamber are very sensitive to geometric 
factors and therefore should be performed only under 
geometric conditions which have been appropriately 
validated.  
Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity 
should be respected.  
The vial should never be opened and must be kept 
inside its lead shielding. The product should be 
aseptically withdrawn through the stopper using 
sterilized single use needle and syringe after 
disinfection of the stopper.  
Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, in 
order to maintain the sterility of LUMARK and to 
maintain sterility throughout the labelling 
procedures.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
When an administration of radioactive medicinal 
products to a woman of childbearing potential is 
intended, it is important to determine whether or not 
she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period 
should be assumed to be pregnant 
until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential 
pregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the 
period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques 
not using ionising radiation (if there are any) should 
be offered to the patient. 
Before the use of 177Lu –labelled medicinal products, 
pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate 
/validated test. 
Pregnancy 
The use of 177Lu -labelled medicinal products is 
contraindicated during established or suspected 
pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded 
(see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a 
mother who is breast-feeding, consideration 
should be given to the possibility of delaying the 
administration of radionuclide until the mother has 
ceased breast-feeding, and to what is the most 
appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing 
in mind the secretion of activity in breast milk. If the 
administration is considered necessary, 
breast-feeding should be interrupted and the 
expressed feeds discarded. 
Fertility 
According to literature reports and taking a 
conservative approach (maximum patient dose of 10 
GBq, average labeling yield and no additional 
measures), it may be considered that 177Lu-labelled 
medicinal products do not lead to reproductive 
toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male 
testes or genetic damage in male testes or female 
ovaries.  
Further information concerning the use of 
177Lu-labelled medicinal products is specified in the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Lumark is a radio-pharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radio-labelling purposes with other medicinal 
products such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates for radio-nuclide therapy. As a precursor, 
Lumark is not intended to be given directly to patients. 
Published data has demonstrated the clinical utility of 177Lu in neuroendocrine tumour therapy with evidence of 
its role in the management of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET). There 
is some evidence of its role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer where 
177Lu-labelled antibodies have been used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with metastasised prostate 
cancer. 
Thus, appropriate information to support an indication as a radio-pharmaceutical precursor for radiolabelling has 
been provided. Relevant non-clinical and clinical information related to the clinical use of the carrier molecules, 
which have been specifically developed and authorised for radio-labelling with this radionuclide, are to be 
included in the SmPC of the carrier molecules. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The clinical utility in breast cancer, brain tumours and bone metastases is still in the non-clinical phase and there 
is not enough clinical evidence to support the clinical utility in these therapies. The clinical utility in prostate 
cancer  is  based  on  studies  with  small  patient  numbers  and  larger  studies  may  be  required  to  support  the 
currently available data in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with prostate cancer. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
There are no major safety concerns with regards to free 177Lu as the doses of Lumark administered are expected 
to be very low and are unlikely to be associated with toxicity. 177Lu has a relatively short half-life of 6.647 days. 
Moreover, and as for all radioactive products, unfavourable effects relating to the radioactivity would be 
expected. These include carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and effects on different tissues. For 177Lu, the 
accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical in bone has been evidenced in non-clinical studies. However, the risk 
has been addressed in the SmPC with the recommended use of the chelator DTPA to minimise the risk of free 
177Lu. Radiotoxicity would also be dependent on the radiation characteristics of 177Lu in Lumark as well as on the 
carrier molecule to which Lumark is labelled. Following therapy with radiolabelled peptides or antibodies, kidney 
retention and renal function loss, bladder radiotoxicity, haematological toxicity, myelodysplastic syndrome and 
liver toxicity have been reported. In addition to radiation exposure to the patient, the risk of radiation exposure 
to other individuals is also a risk, considering the emission of gamma and β particles from 177Lu. Exposure to 
ionising radiation must be justified on the basis of likely clinical benefit. However, the radiation safety of Lumark 
in its use as radiopharmaceutical precursor has been adequately addressed in the product information. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
177Lu has a long half-life in particular in tissues like bone and liver and accumulation in these organs is likely. As 
177Lu is intended to be a radiolabel, the pharmacokinetics is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the carrier

Page 49/53 
  
  
molecule. The radiation effect of accumulation in these organs is not known although this effect would also be 
dependent on the carrier molecule. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Radionuclides like 177Lu have longer half-life equivalent to the biological half-life of the peptide or antibody they 
are intended to be coupled with. 177Lu emits both gamma and β particles providing relatively high radiation dose 
on the target tissue, reducing radiation exposure of other parts of the body.  
Clinical utility of 177Lu in particular in neuroendocrine tumours has been demonstrated as being well-established. 
As  a  radiopharmaceutical  precursor,  claims  of  clinical  benefit  should  be  the  subject  of  assessment  of  an 
application for a radiopharmaceutical labelled with 177Lu.  
The risk of radiation to patients and to others is not unlike with other radionuclides and is dependent on the 
pharmacokinetics of the carrier molecule and necessary precautions with using radiopharmaceuticals would be 
expected when using any carrier molecule labelled with 177Lu. For individual radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 
177Lu,  the  exposure  to  radiation,  including  any  radiation  effect  of  accumulation,  should  be  justified  by  the 
expected  clinical  benefit.  This  should  be  the  subject  of  assessment  in  any  applications  for  these  medicinal 
products.   
Benefit-risk balance 
There are no unresolved issues, which would have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product. 
The clinical utility of Lumark in the diagnosis and treatment of certain tumours has been demonstrated.  The risk 
associated with radiation is as expected with other radionuclides and information on minimising this risk has 
been provided in the RMP and the product information.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Lumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor and is not intended to be administered on its own to patients. As a 
result, the benefits and risks of the intended administration of a 177Lu radiolabeled carrier will be assessed 
independently. For the purpose of an application for a radiopharmaceutical for radiolabelling, the clinical utility 
and the safety of Lumark has been adequately addressed.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Lumark in the as a radiopharmaceutical precursor, not intended for direct use in patients, 
and to be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed and 
authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vandetanib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) from clinical trials, literature and spontaneous 
reports, including in 8 / 11 cases a suggestive/compatible temporal relationship, in one case a positive 
rechallenge and considering that Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is already listed as ADR for vandetanib, the 
PRAC Rapporteur considers that a causal relationship between vandetanib and TEN is at least a reasonable 
possibility.  The  PRAC  Rapporteur  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing 
vandetanib should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for vandetanib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing vandetanib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

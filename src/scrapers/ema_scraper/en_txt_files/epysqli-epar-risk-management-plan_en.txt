Selective immunosuppressants (L04AA25) 
Samsung Bioepis NL B.V. (The Netherlands) 
EPYSQLI 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion 
EPYSQLI  (eculizumab) 
is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal 
Immunoglobulin  (Ig)  G2/4k  antibody  that  binds  to  the  human  C5 
complement protein and inhibits the activation of terminal complement.  
The  eculizumab  antibody  contains  human  constant  regions  and  murine 
complementarity-determining regions grafted onto the human framework 
light- and heavy-chain variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 
448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains and has 
a molecular weight of approximately 148 Kilo-Dalton. 
Eculizumab  is  produced  in  a  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cell  line 
ion  exchange 
expression  system  and  purified  by  affinity  and 
chromatography.  The  bulk  drug  substance  manufacturing  process  also 
includes specific viral inactivation and removal steps. 
Mechanism of action: 
Eculizumab, the active ingredient in EPYSQLI, is a terminal complement 
inhibitor that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high 
affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the 
generation  of  the  terminal  complement  complex  C5b-9.  Eculizumab 
preserves  the  early  components  of  complement  activation  that  are 
essential  for  opsonisation  of  microorganisms  and  clearance  of  immune 
complexes. 
In  Paroxysmal  nocturnal  haemoglobinuria  (PNH)  patients,  uncontrolled 
terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated 
intravascular haemolysis are blocked with eculizumab treatment. 
In most PNH patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of approximately 
35  microgram/mL  are  sufficient  for  essentially  complete  inhibition  of 
terminal complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis. 
In  PNH,  chronic  administration  of  eculizumab  resulted  in  a  rapid  and 
sustained reduction in complement- mediated haemolytic activity. 
In aHUS patients,  uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the

resulting complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy are blocked 
with  eculizumab  treatment. All  patients  treated  with  eculizumab  when 
administered as recommended demonstrated rapid and sustained reduction 
in terminal complement activity.  
In all aHUS patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of approximately 
50 - 100 microgram/mL are sufficient for essentially complete inhibition 
of terminal complement activity.

Risk Management Plan   
PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage:  
As outlined in the "Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
– non-clinical and clinical issues" [EMA, 2012], a risk-based approach was taken to the non-clinical 
evaluation of EPYSQLI. A series of in vitro biologic activity studies were performed to demonstrate 
similarity  between  EPYSQLI  and  Soliris®  and  there  were  no  significantly  different  results  between 
EPYSQLI and Soliris®.  
The in vivo non-clinical study was not performed since the in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) study in 
irrelevant  animal  species  is  unlikely  to  provide  any  additional  meaningful  non-clinical  evidence  to 
demonstrate similarity between the EPYSQLI and Soliris®. It is acknowledged that eculizumab is highly 
species-specific with no appreciable activity against any other mammalian species [EMA Soliris®]. In 
addition, the identified epitope indeed includes the residue W917, which is unique for human C5 [Volk, 
2016]. Of note, animal studies are less sensitive to detect differences between biosimilar and reference 
products and species differences between animals and humans limit the suitability of this approach to 
evaluate  biosimilarity  [Van  Aerts,  2014].  Thus,  in  vivo  animal  studies,  including  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology studies for EPYSQLI development were not performed and this 
was also endorsed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]. 
Although EPYSQLI had not been evaluated in a clinical setting prior to performance of this current 
study,  in  vitro  biologic  activity  studies  showed  no  significant  differences  of  EPYSQLI  compared  to 
Soliris®. Based on the in vitro results, it was expected that EPYSQLI will exhibit similar clinical profiles 
compared to Soliris® and this Phase I study was designed to evaluate eculizumab profiles in healthy 
subjects at the dose of 300 mg.

Rationale for not applicable 
[EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010]  and  the  recommendations  from  the  EMA 
[EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017] [SB12 NCO Section 2.4]. 
No  local  tolerance  studies  have  been  performed  in  line  with  the  EMA  guideline 
“Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  monoclonal 
antibodies:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues”  [EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010] 
and the recommendations from the EMA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017] [SB12 
NCO Section 2.4]. 
Other toxicity studies (i.e. immunotoxicity) were not performed in line with the EMA 
guideline “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues”  [EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010] 
and the recommendations from the EMA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017] [SB12 
NCO Section 2.4]. 
Since EPYSQLI is being developed as a biosimilar product to the reference product 
Soliris®, no additional non-clinical data are considered necessary. 
Safety pharmacology  Safety pharmacology studies were not performed in line with the Scientific Advice 
with  the  EMA  [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/634958/2017]  and  advice  from  the  EMA 
guideline “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies:  non-clinical  and  clinical  issues”  [EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010]. 
Since  EPYSQLI  has  been  developed  as  a  biosimilar  to  Soliris®,  the  safety 
pharmacology package developed for Soliris® should be considered when considering 
this type of toxicity [SB12 NCO Section 2.4]. 
As in vivo non-clinical toxicity study was not performed, there is no discussion nor 
conclusion to be made.

PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Safety data of EPYSQLI (eculizumab) are available from two clinical studies: 
-  SB12-1001- A randomised, double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single-dose study to compare 
the PKs, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PDs of eculizumab (SB12, EU sourced Soliris®, 
and United States (US) sourced Soliris®) in healthy subjects. 
-  SB12-3003-  A  randomized,  double-blind,  multicenter  study,  cross-over  study  to  compare  and 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of SB12 compared to Soliris® in patients 
with PNH. 
Exposure data from the two studies are presented separately. The data from the healthy volunteer study 
(SB12-1001) is summarised in the paragraphs below. 
The clinical safety of SB12 has been assessed in two clinical studies, a clinical Phase I PK study in 
healthy subjects (SB12-1001) and a clinical Phase III efficacy and safety study in patients with PNH 
(SB12-3003). Safety of SB12 in these studies was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs),  AEs  special interest  (e.g.  meningococcal  infection,  other  systemic  infection, 
infusion-related reaction), vital signs, and laboratory evaluations as well as immunogenicity, which is 
an important safety aspect of therapeutic proteins. 
In the clinical Phase I study SB12-1001, a total of 240 subjects were randomised to receive a single dose 
of eculizumab (a single dose of either SB12, EU Soliris®, or US Soliris® via IV infusion for 35 minutes) 
with 80 subjects in each three treatment groups (SB12, EU Soliris®, or US Soliris®), respectively. The 
Safety Set (SAF) consisted of all subjects who received investigational product (IP). 
In the clinical Phase III study SB12-3003, a total of 50 patients were randomised to receive 600 mg of 
either SB12 or Soliris® IV infusion every week for the first 4 weeks (initial phase) and 900 mg for the 
fifth week, followed by 900 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 50. Patients who were randomised 
to initially receive SB12 were switched to receive Soliris® and patients who were randomised to initially 
receive  Soliris®  were  switched  to  receive  SB12  at  Week  26.  The  SAF  consisted  of  all  patients  who 
received at least one IP during the study period. As a result, a total of 49 patients were included in the 
SAF, with 25 (100.0%), 24 (96.0%), 16 (64.0%) and eight (32.0%) patients in the Soliris® to SB12, 
SB12  to  All,  SB12  to  Soliris®,  and  Unplanned  IP  Switch  (during  Period  2,  as  comparator  shortage 
occurred, a total of eight (16.0%) patients who were initially allocated in SB12 to Soliris® received SB12 
instead of Soliris® to avoid abrupt discontinuation of eculizumab, based on the Sponsor assessment that 
treatment  continuity  for  the  patients  should  be  of  the  highest  importance)  treatment  sequences, 
respectively. 
Exposure to SB12 in the Phase III clinical study SB12-3003 is summarised by duration of exposure in 
Table SIII. 1, by age group and gender in Table SIII. 2, and by ethnic or racial origin in Table SIII. 3. 
The total exposure from clinical trial for SB12 is approximately 23.444 patient-years (Table SIII. 1). 
Since  all subjects  received  the  same  dose  of  SB12,  exposure  data  is  not  represented  based  on  dose. 
Special  populations  (e.g.,  pregnant  women,  lactating  women,  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment, 
cardiac impairment, and immunocompromised) were excluded from the study and thus the exposure 
data was not represented for these populations.

PART II: MODULE SIV - POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN 
CLINICAL TRIALS 
The clinical development programme for EPYSQLI as a biosimilar to Soliris® (eculizumab) comprised 
of two studies, Phase I study and a Phase III study. The first study was a randomised, double-blind, 
three-arm, parallel group, single-dose study to compare the PKs, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, 
and PDs of eculizumab (SB12, EU sourced Soliris®, and US sourced Soliris®) in healthy subjects (study 
SB12-1001). The second study was a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to compare 
the  efficacy,  safety,  PKs,  and  immunogenicity  between  SB12  (proposed  eculizumab  biosimilar)  and 
Soliris® in subjects with PNH (study SB12-3003).  
In the Phase I healthy volunteer study, inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to ensure that the 
study population were healthy and homogenous to clarify any risks associated with the study and enable 
appropriate  comparison  of  the  PK,  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  SB12  and  Soliris®. 
Healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential or healthy male subjects aged 18-55 years with 
all screening results within the normal range (or outside the normal range but not clinically significant) 
were included in the study.  
Due to the concept and the nature of a phase I clinical study, the included or excluded population is not 
representative for a safety discussion on populations not studied in clinical trials, but for the discussion 
on the general safety. 
In the Phase III study, inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to compare the efficacy, safety, 
PKs, and immunogenicity between SB12 (proposed eculizumab biosimilar) and Soliris® in subjects with 
PNH. Male or female aged 18 or older and the mean age of all subjects was 38.1 years (range: 18-79 
years) were enrolled in the study.  
SIV.1  Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme 
Exclusion criteria described below are based on the Phase III study SB12-3003. 
Table SIV.1.1: Had received previous treatment with a complement pathway inhibitor (including 
eculizumab) 
Reason for exclusion 
Previous treatments with complement pathway inhibitor can result in ADA 
responses  in  patients  and  these  may  also  hamper  interpretation  of  the 
efficacy  or  safety  data  thereby  decreasing  the  sensitivity  for  detecting 
potential differences 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
The  information  is  included  in  the  SmPC  section  4.4  based  on  the 
information  from  the  reference  product.  Since  the  SmPC  are  aligned  to 
those of the reference product, the applicant does not consider the exclusion 
of these subpopulations to fulfil criteria of missing information.

Epysqli (eculizumab) 
Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
Table SIV.1.2: Known hypersensitivity to the IP or any of the ingredients or excipients of the IP 
Reason for exclusion 
Administration of eculizumab may result in reactions or immunogenicity 
that  could  cause  allergic  or  hypersensitivity  reactions  (including 
anaphylaxis). 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
The  Information  is  included  in  the  SmPC  section  4.3,  4.8  and  Package 
Leaflet (PL) section 4.  As stated in the SmPC and PL, hypersensitivity to 
SB12,  murine  proteins  or  to  any  of  the  excipients  and  ingredients  are 
contraindicated, may affect up to 1 in 100 people. 
Table SIV.1.3: Had a known contraindication/hypersensitivity for meningococcal vaccine or the 
antibiotic to be used in the study 
Reason for exclusion 
Based on the mechanism of action of eculizumab, use of it in patient results 
in susceptibility to increase meningococcal infection. Hence to reduce the 
risk,  all  patients  must  be  vaccinated  at  least  2  weeks  prior  to  receiving 
eculizumab.  However,  vaccination  may  not  be  sufficient  to  prevent 
meningococcal  infection.  So,  consideration  should  also  be  given  to  the 
appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
Patients who are with contraindication/hypersensitivity for meningococcal 
vaccine or the antibiotic to be used in the study cannot fulfil the criteria of 
vaccination because of chances of re-occurrence of hypersensitivity. 
Table SIV.1.4: Had abnormal haematological parameters at screening defined as the following: 
-  Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 0.5 × 103/μL 
-  Platelet count < 70 × 103/μL 
Reason for exclusion 
Administration  of  eculizumab  may  result  in  abnormal  haematological 
parameters such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
The information related to haematological abnormalities are included in the 
SmPC section 4.8.

Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
The information related to meningococcal disease is included in the SmPC 
section 4.3 based on the information from the reference product. Since the 
SmPC are aligned to those of the reference product, the applicant does not 
consider the exclusion of these subpopulations to fulfil criteria of missing 
information. 
Table SIV.1.6: Had a history of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
Reason for exclusion 
Haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  and  eculizumab  both  constitute 
treatment options for PNH. Hence there can be hinderance of effectiveness 
of  eculizumab  in  patients  with  history  of  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
Exclude  patient  with  pre-existing  history  of  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation  where  eculizumab  is  unlikely  to  have  an  effect/effect  is 
masked [de Fontbrune, 2015]. 
Table  SIV.1.7:  Had  a  history  of  serious  thrombotic  event  (e.g.,  stroke,  myocardial  infarction, 
pulmonary embolism, etc.) 
Reason for exclusion 
Patients  with  history  of  serious  thrombotic  events  will  be  on  additional 
medications that can interact with eculizumab and could lead to morbidities 
which in turn can complicate the assessment of safety and effectiveness of 
the eculizumab. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
Excluding  these  patients  reduces  the  risk  of  AEs  caused  by  underlying 
conditions and reduces the difficulty in deciding whether an AE should be 
attributed to the pre-existing condition or to the eculizumab. At the same 
time, it eliminates the possibility of determining whether the drug has an 
adverse or beneficial effect in those populations.

Reason for exclusion 
Treatment  with  eculizumab  increases  the  risk  of  severe  infections  and 
sepsis. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
The information is included in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 based on the 
information  from  the  reference  product.  Since  the  SmPC  are  aligned  to 
those of the reference product, the applicant does not consider the exclusion 
of these subpopulations to fulfil criteria of missing information. 
Table  SIV.1.9:  Had  a  known  history of  human immunodeficiency (HIV)  virus  infection  or  had 
positive results at screening 
Reason for exclusion 
Due  to  complications  related  to  immunosuppression  in  HIV  patients, 
administration of eculizumab can increase the risk of infection. 
Eculizumab treatment may be associated with increased adverse effects for 
individuals with well controlled HIV infection. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
Excluded patient with history of HIV infection. 
Table  SIV.1.10:  Concomitant  use  of  any  of  the  following  medications  is  prohibited  with  the 
following conditions 
-  Erythropoietin, systemic corticosteroids, low-molecular-weight heparins, iron supplements, 
and androgen therapy not on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug 
(Day 1) 
-  Warfarin  with  an  unstable  international  normalised  ratio  for  at  least  4  weeks  prior  to 
initiation of study drug (Day 1) at the discretion of the Investigator 
-  Cyclosporine not on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to initiation of study drug (Day 1) 
Reason for exclusion 
Patients  on  concomitant  medications  can  interact  with  eculizumab  and 
could lead to morbidities which in turn can complicate the assessment of 
safety and effectiveness of the eculizumab. These drugs are also used as 
supportive therapy for PNH. Hence, they can influence the outcome of the 
study. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
Because  of  concerns  about  potential  adverse  impacts  arising  from 
concomitant medications.

procedures  within  30  days  or  within  5  half-lives  of  that  IP  prior  to  screening,  whichever  was 
greater 
Reason for exclusion 
It  concerns  about  the  elimination  of  the  drug  from  the  plasma.  Drug 
interactions  and  the  effects  of  the  previous  drug  in  the  patient  can  be 
prevented by following the rationale of time frame. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
Time required  for the concentration of a drug to  fall to  half of its initial 
concentration after reaching its peak is defined as half-live of a drug. 95-
97% of the drug is eliminated after five half-lives. By this, interactions with 
the eculizumab and effects of the previous drug (therapeutic or adverse) can 
be prevented. 
Table SIV.1.12: Had a history of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except for curatively 
treated  carcinoma  in  situ  of  uterine  cervix,  basal  cell  carcinoma  of  the  skin,  or  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the skin. 
Reason for exclusion 
These patients were excluded to provide better data quality. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
These patients were excluded to provide better data quality. The applicant 
does  not  suppose  these  exclusion  criteria  to  have  a  sound  basis  for  a 
deviation from the missing information described for the reference product. 
Table  SIV.1.13: Had  any other  cardiac,  hepatic, immunologic,  pulmonary,  rheumatoid  disease, 
other conditions causing rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (e.g., tumours, muscular dystrophies, 
liver and bile disease, etc.), or disorders which, at the discretion of the Investigator, would put the 
subjects at risk if enrolled. 
Reason for exclusion 
These conditions can lead to patients taking additional medications that can 
interact with an eculizumab, that could complicate the assessment of safety 
and effectiveness of the eculizumab. Excluding such patients reduces the 
risk of AEs caused by underlying conditions and reduces the difficulty in 
deciding whether an AE should be attributed to the pre-existing condition 
or to eculizumab. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
These are the conditions which can put the subject at risk. These can cause 
different effectiveness or safety responses to the eculizumab

Table SIV.1.14: Other unspecified reasons at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor, made 
the subjects unsuitable for enrolment. 
Reason for exclusion 
These includes comorbidities or concomitant treatment or factors that could 
mask the effect of the eculizumab. By these reasons there are chances of 
elimination  of  the  possibility  of  determining  whether  eculizumab  has  an 
adverse or beneficial effect in PNH. 
Is it considered to be included 
as missing information? 
No 
Rationale 
These are the reasons which can influence safety and effectiveness of the 
eculizumab. Hence these reasons can characterise the patient and will be 
disqualified from participation. 
SIV.2  Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development 
programmes  
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as rare 
adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or cumulative 
exposure.

SVII.3 Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, and 
missing information 
Based on the EMA guidance on similar biological medicinal products, the RMP should take into account 
identified and potential risks associated with the use of the reference product. Therefore, this section 
will contain all the important identified risks and important potential risks described in the RMP for the 
reference product, Soliris®, and from the scientific literature. 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks  
SVII.3.1.1 Important identified risk 
Meningococcal infections  
Potential mechanisms:  
Eculizumab  mode  of  action  is  based  on  terminal  complement  C5  inhibition.  Deficiency  of  terminal 
complement components is associated with an increased incidence of infection with Neisseria species, 
in particular N. meningitidis. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
This identified risk is based on the results from the clinical development programme for eculizumab. 
Eculizumab mode of action is based on terminal complement C5 inhibition which is associated with an 
increased  incidence  of  meningococcal  infections  caused  by  N.  meningitidis,  as  meningococcus  is 
primarily cleared by the terminal complement components. 
Further evidence linking meningococcal infections to terminal complement inhibition can be found in 
the scientific literature [Figueroa, 1991; Ross, 1984; Balmer, 2002; Cartwright, 2001; Ram, 2010]. 
Characterisation of the risk:  
Frequency with 95% Confidence Interval (CI):  
No cases were reported in the EPYSQLI Phase III study. 
Severity: 
Meningococcal infection is usually serious in nature and can quickly become life-threatening or fatal if 
not recognised early and treated with appropriate antibiotics. 
Cases of meningococcal infections have been reported in eculizumab-treated patients. All cases were 
considered as serious and all patients were hospitalised. The most severe patients required intensive care. 
Sepsis was the most frequent clinical presentation of the disease. 
Reversibility and long-term outcomes: 
Acute infection must be timely treated with antibiotics and patients usually recover after such treatment, 
although may be left with sequelae. Cases with fatal outcomes have been observed in the post-marketing 
setting. 
Impact on quality of life: 
Since  meningococcal  infections  are  usually  serious  and  life-threatening  infectious  diseases  with 
Version 2.0: Nov 10, 2023

Epysqli (eculizumab) 
Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
potentially  fatal  outcomes,  requiring  hospitalisation  and  timely  antibiotic  treatment,  the  impact  on 
patients' quality of life is significant. Moreover, patients may be left with sequelae such as neurological 
changes or amputations of fingers/toes. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Main risk factors for these infections include: 
-  Genetic deficiency or therapeutic inhibition of terminal complement 
-  Lack of commercially available vaccine against certain meningococcus serogroup 
- 
(Partial) resistance of meningococcal strain to prophylactic antibiotics 
-  Professionals who are exposed to environments of greater risk for meningococcal disease 
-  Research,  industrial,  and  clinical  laboratory  personnel  who  are  routinely  exposed  to  N. 
meningitidis 
-  Military  personnel  during  recruit  training  (military  personnel  may  be  at  increased  risk  of 
meningococcal infection when accommodated in close quarters) 
-  Day-care centre workers 
-  Living on a college or university campus 
-  Travelling  to  endemic  areas  for  meningococcal  meningitis  (e.g.  India,  Sub-Saharan  Africa, 
pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia for Hajj). 
No data were identified as additional risk factors for meningococcal infections related to underlying 
disease such as PNH or aHUS. 
Preventability: 
The occurrence of meningococcal infections can be prevented in some cases by means of meningococcal 
vaccines.  However,  it  is  recognised  that  meningococcal  vaccination  may  not  prevent  all  cases  of 
meningococcal infections. 
Also,  available  meningococcal  vaccines do  not cover  all  serogroups.  In  patients  who  cannot  receive 
meningococcal  vaccine, including  infants or  patients at risk  of developing  further activation  of their 
underlying  complement  mediated  disease,  antibiotic  prophylaxis  could  prevent  meningococcal 
infections. 
Refer  to  Part  V.2  for  a  detailed  description  of  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  for  EPYSQLI, 
designed to prevent and/or minimise this risk.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Meningococcal infections are life-threatening (and potentially fatal) conditions with significant impact 
on  patient's  quality  of  life  (especially  if  presenting  with  sequelae),  hence,  the  implementation  of 
additional risk minimisation measures. The data available to date suggest a stable overall reporting rates 
of meningococcal infections in patients treated with eculizumab of 0.3 to 0.5 per 100 patient-years over 
the five past years with reported fatal outcomes similar to the reporting rate in the general population. 
The mitigation measures in place for the risk of meningococcal infections appear to be appropriate and 
effective.

Risk Management Plan   
Public health impact:  
Meningococcal infections represent life-threatening diseases. The impact of these infections on patients 
can be minimised by early recognition of the symptoms by patients/healthcare professionals (HCPs), 
and early institution of appropriate antibiotics.  
The post-marketing reporting rate of meningococcal infection in patient treated with eculizumab has 
continued to be consistent over the 10 years of post-marketing experience at approximately 0.3 to 0.5 
per 100 patient-years over the past 5 years. The reporting rate for fatal outcome remained stable as well 
at 0.03 per 100 patient-years representing 9.2% of patients who experienced meningococcal infections, 
similar to the reporting rate in the general population (10% to 15%) [Rosenstein, 1999; van Deuren, 
2000]. 
Serious infections (including sepsis) 
Potential mechanisms:  
Eculizumab mode of action is based on terminal complement C5 inhibition which is associated with an 
increased  incidence  of  neisserial  infections,  as  Neisseria  spp.  are  primarily  cleared  by  terminal 
complement  components.  The  role  of  terminal  complement  inhibition  in  incidence  of  other  serious 
infections is much lower as eculizumab does not inhibit early complement components which are able 
to clear most of infections other than those caused by Neisseria spp. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
This identified risk is based on the results from the clinical development programme for eculizumab. 
Eculizumab mode of action is based on terminal complement C5 inhibition, impacting in a minor way 
the ability to clear also infections other than Neisseria spp. infections in eculizumab-treated patients, 
potentially leading to serious infections and/or sepsis, even though this impact is significantly lower 
since early complement components are not affected by eculizumab. 
However,  scientific  literature  shows  that  patients  with  terminal  complement  deficiency  are  only  at 
increased risk of Neisseria spp. infections [Figueroa, 1991; Ram, 2010] same as data from PNH registry  
of  the  originator  (Soliris®)  comparing  treated  and  untreated  patients  which  do  not  demonstrate 
association between eculizumab treatment and infections other than Neisseria spp. infections. 
Characterisation of the risk:  
Frequency with 95% CI:  
There was one serious event of serious infections (including sepsis) in one patient treated with EPYSQLI 
(subject incidence: 2.128%; 95% CI: 0.054, 11.294) corresponding to an exposure-adjusted event rate 
of 4.265 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 0.108, 23.766). There was one serious event of serious 
infections (including sepsis) in one patient treated with Soliris® (subject incidence: 2.128%; 95% CI: 
0.054, 11.294) corresponding to an exposure-adjusted event rate of 5.096 events per 100 patient-years

Severity: 
Infections  may  become  rapidly  serious  in  immunocompromised  patients  such  as  patient  with  bone 
marrow disorders, renal failure or receiving immunosuppressive drugs. Serious infections have been 
reported  in  patients  receiving  eculizumab.  Patients  generally  recovered  without  sequelae  after  anti-
infective treatment. 
Most of these reports were confounded by other underlying severe conditions known as risk factors for 
serious  infection  such  as  bone  marrow  failure,  renal  failure  with  dialysis,  Diabetes  Mellitus  or 
concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
The severity of serious infections range from mild to severe. Serious infection does represent a severe 
condition  with  a  potential  for  fatal  outcome.  Sepsis  is  usually  serious  and  can  quickly  become  life-
threatening or fatal if not recognised early and treated appropriately. 
In the EPYSQLI treatment group, one event of serious infections (including sepsis) was reported to be

severe in severity (4.265 events per 100 patient-years; 95% CI: 0.108, 23.766). In the Soliris® treatment

Reversibility and long-term outcomes: 
Reversibility and long-term outcomes depend on the nature of infection and characteristics of affected 
patient.  The  experience  from  the  clinical  trials  with  eculizumab  shows  that  patients  who  developed 
serious infection generally recovered without sequelae with appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, 
cases  of  sepsis  (mostly  associated  with  meningococcal  infections)  with  fatal  outcomes  have  been 
reported.  
In a study, seven children (median age 12 months, range 3-28 months) diagnosed with Post-transplant 
haemolytic uremic syndrome, out of which three patients were treated with the complement C5 inhibitor 
eculizumab.  During  a  median  follow-up  time  of  11.3  years,  one  patient  died  due  to  infectious 
complications after transplantation [Holle, 2021]. 
Impact on quality of life: 
Sepsis is a systemic response to an acute infection. For patients who experience infection or sepsis, the 
impact  on  quality  of  life  is  significant  due  to  prolonged  hospitalisation  for  antibiotic  therapy  and 
supportive care. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Underlying  immunodeficiency  condition  represents  general  risk  factor  for  serious  infection:  either 
acquired (e.g. Aplastic Anaemia (AA) or Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) in patients with PNH or 
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in patients with aHUS) or due to immunosuppressive drugs. 
Preventability: 
Increased awareness of HCP and patient about the risk of infection and the related signs and symptoms 
of serious infection are helpful in minimising the impact of the risk. Eculizumab should be administered 
with caution to patients with active systemic infections. Prior to initiating eculizumab, it is recommended 
that patients should initiate immunisations according to current immunisation guidelines. 
All patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections at least 2 weeks prior to receiving 
EPYSQLI  unless  the  risk  of  delaying  EPYSQLI  therapy  outweighs  the  risks  of  developing  a 
meningococcal infection. Patients who initiate EPYSQLI treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a 
meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks 
after vaccination. Patients less than 18 years of age must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae

and pneumococcal infections, and strictly need to adhere to the national vaccination recommendations 
for each age group. 
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement-mediated diseases, 
including  PNH,  may  experience  increased  signs  and  symptoms  of  their  underlying  disease,  such  as 
haemolysis  (PNH).  Therefore,  patients  should  be  closely  monitored  for  disease  symptoms  after 
recommended vaccination. 
Refer to  Part  V.2  for  a  detailed  description  of  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  for  EPYSQLI, 
designed to prevent and/or minimise this risk.  
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Since this risk is directly associated with the mechanism of eculizumab action, it has a significant impact 
on the benefit-risk balance of EPYSQLI, but acceptable in the light of the anticipated benefits of the 
therapy. The reported rate of serious infections including sepsis remained stable over the 10 years of 
post-marketing experience with EPYSQLI. Risk minimisation measures in place and long-term post-
marketing  experience  with  eculizumab  showed  that  all  patients  who  experienced  serious  non-
meningococcal  infections  were  noted  to  have  severe  underlying  conditions  with  associated 
immunosuppressive treatment and co-morbidities. 
Public health impact:  
Serious  infections  could  be  life-threatening  or  fatal. Generally,  serious  infections  require  prolonged. 
hospitalisation  for  antibiotic  therapy  and  supportive  care.  Close  monitoring  of  serious  infections 
including sepsis over the 10 years of post-marketing experience demonstrates no significant increase of 
serious  infections  other  than  infections  with  Neisseria  spp.  in  patients  treated  with  eculizumab.  In 
addition, data from PNH registry of the originator (Soliris®) comparing treated and untreated patients 
do  not  demonstrate  association  between  eculizumab  treatment  and  infections  other  than  Neisseria 
infections. 
Aspergillus infection 
Potential mechanism(s): 
Host  defence  against  Aspergillus  infection  is  mainly  driven  by  cellular  immunity  and  complement 
component  (C3a,  C3b  iC3b,  and  C5a)  allowing  chemotaxis  and  opsonisation,  thus  eculizumab  C5 
blockade has only a partial effect on host defence against Aspergillus infections. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
This identified risk is based on the results from the clinical development programme for eculizumab for 
prevention of antibody mediated rejection in kidney transplant recipients (Study C10-001 and C10-002). 
Since host defence against Aspergillus infection is mainly driven by cellular immunity and complement 
component  (C3a,  C3b  iC3b,  and  C5a),  allowing  chemotactism  and  opsonisation,  eculizumab  C5 
blockade has only a partial effect on the host defence against Aspergillus infections and therefore, has 
been observed only in severely immunocompromised patients. Further evidence linking aspergillosis to 
immunocompromised states is provided in the scientific literature [Speth, 2012; Lin, 2001; Galimberti, 
2012; Valdez, 2009; Weinberger, 1992; Ruhnke, 2007; Rüping, 2008]. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
No cases were reported in the EPYSQLI Phase III study.

Epysqli (eculizumab) 
Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
Severity: 
Aspergillus infection, particularly invasive aspergillosis is usually serious and can quickly become life-
threatening or fatal if not recognised early and treated appropriately.  
Aspergillus infections and particularly invasive aspergillosis does represent a severe condition with a 
potential for fatal outcome. 
Reversibility and long-term outcomes: 
Despite antimycotic therapy and surgical interventions, the fatality of invasive aspergillosis is high and 
depends on the degree of immunosuppression and on the affected organs. 
In the prospective cohort study, patients were treated with eculizumab after transplantation were divided 
into the therapeutic (onset of aHUS after transplantation) and prophylactic use (patients with previous 
diagnosis of aHUS undergoing kidney transplantation). In this study one patient died at six months, due 
to Aspergillus infection [de Andrade, 2017]. 
Impact on quality of life: 
Aspergillus infection is an acute infection with potentially significant impact on affected patients. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Underlying  severe  immunodeficiency  condition,  acquired  or  due  to  other  immunosuppressive  drugs 
including steroids, exposure to construction or demolition, severe pancytopenia due to aplastic anaemia 
(AA), and pre-existing lung impairment or pre-existing Aspergillus infection. 
Preventability: 
Increased  awareness  of  HCP  and  patient  about  the  risk  of  Aspergillus  infection  and  underlying  risk 
factors to develop an Aspergillus infection are helpful in minimising the impact of the risk. 
Eculizumab should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections, including 
Aspergillus  infections.  Consider  the  risk  factors  to  develop  an  Aspergillus  infection  prior  starting 
treatment with eculizumab and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk. Refer to Part V.2 for a 
detailed description of additional risk minimisation measures for EPYSQLI, designed to prevent and/or 
minimise this risk. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Aspergillus  infections  are  life-threatening  condition  with  potentially  fatal  outcomes.  hence,  the 
implementation  of  risk  minimisation  measures.  The  reporting  rates  from  post-marketing  Aspergillus 
infections in patients treated with eculizumab have been stable over the past 5 years and similar to the 
rates in patients at risk (i.e. severely immunosuppressed individuals) within the general population. 
Public health impact: 
Invasive Aspergillus infection is a life-threatening infection which can be fatal. Early recognition and 
treatment is important in mitigating the risk. The reporting rate for post-marketing Aspergillus infections 
has been stable over the past 10 years and when documented, all cases include multiple confounding 
factors  severe  immunosuppression  in  particular  that  provide  alternative  causal  association.  Patient 
treated  with  eculizumab  appears  to  have  similar  reporting  rate  as  patients  at-risk  within  the  general 
population. No difference in occurrence of Aspergillus infections has been observed in PNH registry of 
the originator (Soliris®) when comparing treated and non-treated patients.

Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
Potential mechanism(s): 
As with all therapeutic proteins, administration of EPYSQLI may result in infusion reactions and could 
cause allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
This identified risk is based on the observations made within the clinical development programme for 
eculizumab.  As  with  all  therapeutic  proteins,  administration  of  EPYSQLI  may  result  in  infusion 
reactions  and  could  cause  allergic  or  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Most  of  infusion-reactions  which 
occurred  in  patients  receiving  eculizumab  were  non-serious  and  did  not  required  discontinuation  of 
eculizumab.  In  the  post  marketing  setting  anaphylactic /  anaphylactoid reactions  have  been reported 
during or following eculizumab infusion. 
In  PNH  clinical  studies,  AEs  were  documented  in  the  case report form  as  to  whether  they  occurred 
within 24 or 48 hours of study medication.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
There were three events of infusion reactions in three patients treated with EPYSQLI (subject incidence: 
6.383%; 95% CI: 1.336, 17.539) corresponding to an exposure-adjusted event rate of 12.796 events per 
100 patient-years (95% CI: 2.639, 37.396). There were 13 events of infusion reactions in 11 patients 
treated  with  Soliris®  (subject  incidence:  23.404%;  95%  CI:  12.303,  38.026),  and  the  corresponding 
exposure-adjusted event rate was 66.252 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 35.276, 113.292).

Impact on quality of life: 
None 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Patients with hypersensitivity to eculizumab, murine proteins or to any of the excipients. No data were 
identified for the risk factors for infusion reactions in patients with PNH. 
Preventability: 
Do  not  initiate  EPYSQLI  therapy  in  patients  with  known  hypersensitivity  to  eculizumab,  murine 
proteins or to any of the excipients. 
Refer to  Part  V.2  for  a  detailed  description  of  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  for  EPYSQLI, 
designed to prevent and/or minimise this risk. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
The impact of this risk on benefit-risk profile of EPYSQLI is acceptable in the light of the anticipated 
benefits of the therapy and risk minimisation measures in place. 
Public health impact: 
Administration of eculizumab may result in infusion reactions. Infusion reactions are usually benign and 
consist  of  redness,  pruritus,  local  pain.  In  rare  instances,  infusion reactions  may  lead  to  very  severe 
complications such as anaphylactic shock.  
Due to the low frequency of serious infusion reactions, limited impact on public health is expected for 
this important identified risk. 
Severe TMA complications due to drug discontinuation in aHUS patients 
Potential mechanism(s): 
aHUS is a chronic and debilitating life-threatening disease due to life-long uncontrolled complement 
activation.  Eculizumab  treatment  inhibits  this  otherwise  uncontrolled  complement  activation.  The 
discontinuation of eculizumab can result in signs and symptoms of severe TMA complications. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
This risk resulted from the clinical development programme for eculizumab in aHUS patients. aHUS 
is a chronic and debilitating life-threatening disease due to life-long uncontrolled complement 
activation. Eculizumab treatment inhibits this otherwise uncontrolled complement activation. The 
discontinuation of eculizumab can result in signs and symptoms of severe TMA complications. The 
efficacy results from C11-003 observational study indicate that patients who discontinued eculizumab 
experience a higher rate of TMA complications (3-fold) compared to patients who never discontinued 
eculizumab treatment.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
No study was conducted for aHUS patients with EPYSQLI.  
Seriousness/outcomes: 
No study was conducted for aHUS patients with EPYSQLI. 
Severity:

Epysqli (eculizumab) 
Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
No study was conducted for aHUS patients with EPYSQLI. 
Reversibility: 
If aHUS patients discontinue treatment with Epysqli, they should be monitored closely for signs and 
symptoms of severe TMA complications. Monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent severe 
thrombotic microangiopathy complications in patients with aHUS after discontinuation of Epysqli. 
Long-term outcomes: 
ESRD  in  kidney  allograft  requiring  chronic  dialysis;  ESRD;  residual  renal  insufficiency,  kidney 
transplant patients 
Impact on quality of life: 
Severe TMA complications could be triggered by eculizumab discontinuation and may lead to kidney 
failure or ESRD. Providing that the patients are normally receiving eculizumab to treat their condition 
there is no impact on patient’s quality of life. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Complement dysregulation due to genetic abnormalities or acquired deficiencies in patients with 
aHUS is associated with TMA [Tsai 2006, Benz and Amann 2010]. 
Preventability: 
Increased awareness of HCP and patient about the risk of TMA complications after discontinuation 
and their related signs and symptoms are helpful in minimising the impact of the risk.  
Refer to Part V.2 for a detailed description of additional risk minimisation measures for Epysqli, 
designed to prevent and/or minimise this risk. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
The impact of this risk on benefit-risk profile of EPYSQLI is acceptable in the light of the anticipated 
benefits of the therapy and risk minimisation measures in place. 
Public health impact: 
Severe TMA complications are associated with life-threatening conditions including acute renal failure 
potentially leading to ESRD requiring chronic dialysis and/or renal transplant. Other manifestations of 
severe TMA complications can affect multiple organs such as lung, heart, brain and lead to devastating 
complications. 
Patients and HCPs are provided with educational materials to inform them of this risk and provide means 
to mitigate and address this risk by identifying signs/symptoms and procedures/treatments in case of 
severe TMA complications. These educational materials recommend patients to be closely monitored at 
least 12 weeks after Epysqli discontinuation. 
SVII.3.1.2 Important potential risks 
Serious haemolysis after drug discontinuation in PNH patients 
Potential mechanism (s): 
Patients with PNH experience chronic haemolysis of terminal complement inhibitor deficient red blood 
cells. To the extent that eculizumab effectively prevents lysis of these cells, the PNH red blood cells 
may become a higher proportion of the red blood cell population with eculizumab treatment. 
Version 2.0: Nov 10, 2023 
Page 34/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epysqli (eculizumab) 
Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
Therefore, PNH patients treated with eculizumab for a period long enough to increase their number of 
PNH  red  blood  cells  are  potentially  at  risk  for  serious  haemolysis  following  discontinuation  of 
eculizumab therapy. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
This potential risk is a theoretical possibility in PNH patients, based on the mode of eculizumab action 
and nature of PNH. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
There were two events of serious haemolysis post discontinuation in two patients treated with EPYSQLI 
(subject incidence: 4.255%; 95% CI: 0.520, 14.541) corresponding to an exposure-adjusted event rate 
of  8.531  events  per  100  patient-years  (95%  CI:  1.033,  30.817).  There  were  no  events  of  serious 
haemolysis post discontinuation in patients treated with Soliris®.

Not yet established  
Impact on quality of life: 
Aggravation  of  serious  haemolysis  may  occur  because  of  eculizumab  discontinuation  and  it  may 
profoundly impact patient's quality of life. Providing that the patients are normally receiving eculizumab 
to treat their condition, there is no impact on patient's quality of life. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
PNH:  No  data  were identified  for  risk  factors  for  serious  haemolysis  due  to  drug  discontinuation  in 
patients with PNH.

Epysqli (eculizumab) 
Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
This potential risk is based on the theoretical possibility, associated with abrupt drug discontinuation, 
resulting in a so-called rebound effect. Rebound effect is described for many biologicals but has not yet 
been observed with eculizumab. The potential impact of this risk on benefit-risk balance of EPYSQLI 
is considered acceptable in the light of anticipate benefits of the therapy. 
Public health impact: 
Serious haemolysis following discontinuation of eculizumab therapy may lead to severe complications 
such as anaemia, angina, change in mental status, creatinine increase or thrombosis. 
Educational materials recommend the patient to be closely monitored up to eight weeks after EPYSQLI 
discontinuation.  
Considering the ultra-rare nature of PNH, no significant impact on public health is expected. 
Immunogenicity 
Potential mechanism(s): 
Even though immunogenicity is a known class effect of monoclonal antibody (mAb), it has not been 
demonstrated with eculizumab. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
This potential risk is based on the known potential of all medicinal products and on the class effect of 
all therapeutic proteins, including mAbs. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
There were three events of immunogenicity in three patients treated with EPYSQLI (subject incidence: 
6.383%; 95% CI: 1.336, 17.539) corresponding to an exposure-adjusted event rate of 12.796 events per 
100  patient-years  (95%  CI:  2.639,  37.396). There  were  13  events  of  immunogenicity  in  11  patients 
treated  with  Soliris®  (subject  incidence:  23.404%;  95%  CI:  12.303,  38.026),  and  the  corresponding 
exposure-adjusted event rate was 66.252 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 35.276, 113.292).

Refer to  Part  V.2  for  a  detailed  description  of  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  for  EPYSQLI, 
designed to minimise this risk. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Risk of immunogenicity is common to all biologicals. Patients may develop adenosine deaminase (ADA) 
which may or may not be clinically meaningful. Development of ADA may cause variable level of loss 
of  drug's  efficacy,  but  also  results  in  serious  adverse drug  reaction  (various  allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions  in  nature).  No  clinically  meaningful  outcomes  resulting  from  the  development  of  anti- 
eculizumab antibodies were described in the eculizumab clinical trials or in the post-marketing setting. 
The impact of this risk on EPYSQLI benefit-risk balance is acceptable in the light of anticipated benefits 
of the therapy. 
Public health impact: 
Immunogenicity to eculizumab could lead to the loss of activity and potentially severe immune reaction 
at the time of infusion.  
Health care professionals are provided with educational material to inform them that administration of 
EPYSQLI  may  result  in  infusion  reactions  or  immunogenicity  that  could  cause  allergic  or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). 
Limited impact on public health is expected for this important potential risk.

Section 1.8.2 
Risk Management Plan   
PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Epysqli (eculizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Epysqli. The RMP details important risks of 
Epysqli, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about risks and 
uncertainties (missing information) of Epysqli. 
Summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  of  Epysqli  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential 
information to Health Care Professionals and patients on how Epysqli should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Epysqli should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the RMP of Epysqli. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Epysqli is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH) and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
eculizumab as the active substance and it is given by Intravenous (IV) route of administration.  
Further information about the evaluation of benefits can be found in EPAR of Epysqli, including in its 
plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Epysqli, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Epysqli risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Epysqli, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update reports assessment so that immediate action can be 
taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Epysqli (eculizumab) are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Epysqli. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected.

II.B Summary of important risks 
II.B.1 Important identified risk 
Important Identified Risk: Meningococcal infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
This  identified  risk  is  based  on  the  results  from  the  clinical  development 
programme for eculizumab. Eculizumab mode of action is based on terminal 
complement  Component  5  (C5)  inhibition  which  is  associated  with  an 
increased  incidence  of  meningococcal  infections  caused  by  Neisseria 
meningitidis,  as  meningococcus  is  primarily  cleared  by  the  terminal 
complement components. 
Further evidence linking  meningococcal infections to terminal complement 
inhibition can be found in the scientific literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Main risk factors for these infections include: 
-  Genetic deficiency or therapeutic inhibition of terminal complement 
-  Lack of commercially available vaccine against certain meningococcus 
serogroup

-  (Partial) resistance of meningococcal strain to prophylactic antibiotics 
-  Professionals who are exposed to environments of greater risk for 
meningococcal disease 
-  Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory personnel who are 
routinely exposed to N. meningitidis 
-  Military personnel during recruit training (military personnel may be 
at increased risk of meningococcal infection when accommodated in 
close quarters) 
-  Day-care centre workers 
-  Living on a college or university campus 
-  Travelling to endemic areas for meningococcal meningitis (e.g. India, 
Sub-Saharan Africa, pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia for Hajj) 
No data were identified as additional risk factors for meningococcal infections 
related to underlying disease such as PNH or aHUS.

complement C5 inhibition, impacting in a minor way the ability to clear also 
infections other than Neisseria spp. infections in eculizumab-treated patients, 
potentially leading to serious infections and/or sepsis, even though this impact 
is significantly lower since early complement components are not affected by 
eculizumab. 
However, scientific literature shows that patients with terminal complement 
deficiency are only at increased risk of Neisseria spp. infections same as data 
from  PNH  registry  of  the  originator  (Soliris®)  comparing  treated  and 
untreated patients which do not demonstrate association between eculizumab 
treatment and infections other than Neisseria spp. infections. 
Underlying  immunodeficiency  condition  represents  general  risk  factor  for 
infection:  either  acquired  (e.g.  Aplastic  Anaemia  (AA)  or 
serious 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients with PNH or End-Stage Renal 
Disease in patients with aHUS) or due to other immunosuppressive drugs.

Important Identified Risk: Aspergillus infection 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
This  identified  risk  is  based  on  the  results  from  the  clinical  development 
programme for eculizumab for prevention of antibody mediated rejection in 
kidney transplant recipients. Since host defence against Aspergillus infection 
is mainly driven by cellular immunity and complement component (C3a, C3b 
iC3b,  and  C5a),  allowing  chemotactism  and  opsonisation,  eculizumab  C5 
blockade  has  only  a  partial  effect  on  the  host  defence  against  Aspergillus 
severely 
infections  and 
immunocompromised patients.

Important Identified Risk: Infusion reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
This  identified  risk  is  based  on  the  observations  made  within  the  clinical 
development  programme  for  eculizumab.  As  with  all  therapeutic  proteins, 
administration of EPYSQLI may result in infusion reactions and could cause 
allergic  or  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Most  of  infusion-reactions  which 
occurred  in  patients  receiving  eculizumab  were  non-serious  and  did  not 
required  discontinuation  of  eculizumab.  In  the  post  marketing  setting 
anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions have been reported during or following 
eculizumab infusion. 
In PNH clinical studies, AEs were documented in the case report form as to 
whether they occurred within 24 or 48 hours of study medication. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with hypersensitivity to eculizumab, murine proteins or to any of the 
excipients. 
No data were identified for the risk factors for infusion reactions in patients 
with PNH or aHUS.

Important Identified Risk: Severe TMA complications due to drug discontinuation in aHUS patients 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
This risk resulted from the clinical development programme for eculizumab 
in aHUS patients. aHUS is a chronic and debilitating life-threatening disease 
due to life-long uncontrolled complement activation. Eculizumab treatment 
this  otherwise  uncontrolled  complement  activation.  The 
inhibits 
discontinuation  of  eculizumab  can  result  in  signs  and  symptoms  of  severe 
TMA complications. The efficacy results from C11-003 observational study 
indicate that patients who discontinued eculizumab experience a higher rate 
of TMA complications (3-fold) compared to patients who never discontinued 
eculizumab treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Complement dysregulation due to genetic abnormalities or acquired 
deficiencies is associated with TMA.

Neisseria meningitidis and other Neisseria species, including disseminated gonorrhoea. 
•  All patients must be monitored for signs of meningococcal infection. 
•  The  need  for  patients  to  be  vaccinated  against  Neisseria  meningitidis  two  weeks  prior  to 
receiving eculizumab and/or to receive antibiotic prophylaxis 
•  The  requirement  to  vaccinate  children  against  pneumococcus  and  haemophilus  before 
eculizumab treatments 
•  There  is  an  important  risk  of  Aspergillus  infection  in  patients  treated  with  eculizumab.  The 
HCPs should be advised to look for risk factors and signs and symptoms of Aspergillus infection. 
Practical advice should be included to mitigate the risk. 
•  The risk of infusion reactions including anaphylaxis and advice on post-infusion monitoring 
•  The risk of developing antibodies to eculizumab 
•  Risk  of  serious  haemolysis  following  eculizumab  discontinuation  and  postponement  of 
administration, its criteria, the required post-treatment monitoring and its proposed management 
(PNH only).

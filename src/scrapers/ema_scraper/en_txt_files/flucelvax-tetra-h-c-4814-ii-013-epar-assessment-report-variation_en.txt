2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Influenza is a highly infectious disease that occurs in epidemics throughout the winter months. The 
disease is caused by transmission of respiratory droplets containing the influenza virus particles. 
Influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of respiratory and systemic effects, such as fever, 
myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis. The disease presents as a 
non-specific systemic illness which may be complicated by a range of viral or bacterial infections. Clinical 
manifestations are generally consistent across adult and paediatric populations, however variability in 
clinical presentation may occur within or between adult, older adult or paediatric age groups, and some

manifestations may be age-specific, such as irritability in young children. Fever tends to be less frequent 
and less pronounced in older adults compared with adults and children.  
Some individuals are more prone than others to develop complications from influenza, e.g. bacterial 
pneumonia or other organ dysfunction. Severe influenza and complicated influenza potentially leading to 
hospitalisation and death are more likely to occur in vulnerable populations, such as older people (≥65 
years of age), pregnant women, younger children (especially up to 24 months of age) and patients with 
chronic underlying diseases. These groups are considered at risk and represent the priority target for 
influenza vaccination programmes in the EU. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Prophylaxis of influenza in adults and children from 2 years of age. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Influenza epidemics occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere during winter 
months. Worldwide, annual influenza epidemics result in about 90 million cases with approximately 3 to 5 
million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths, of which 28,000 to 111,500 occur 
in children. The main prevention strategy to minimize influenza burden is through annual prophylactic 
vaccination. Influenza vaccines are designed to protect against illness from the circulating virus strains. 
The most commonly used vaccines have been inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). The World Health 
Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for specific group of people which are 
more at risk of complications and death: pregnant women, elderly individuals (≥65 years of age), 
individuals with chronic medical conditions, health care workers, and children aged from 6 months to 5 
years. Additionally, some public health authorities are moving towards vaccination strategies to reduce 
the risk of influenza in all age groups in an effort to decrease overall disease burden and spread to those 
in the population who are most at risk.   
Traditionally and until 2012, seasonal influenza vaccines included antigens from 3 influenza strains in 
their composition, 2 influenza A strains (largely A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and a strain from 1 of the 2 
influenza B lineages (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria). This is because the majority of global influenza disease 
cases in humans since 1977 have been caused by circulating A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B strains 
viruses. Influenza B strains from the 2 lineages have co-circulated yearly since 1980s, when they 
emerged, with either or both types prevalent within any given year with no cross protection between the 
lineages.  
The difficulty of choosing the correct B lineage to include in influenza vaccine formulations raises the 
possibility of a mismatch between the influenza B strain contained in the influenza vaccine and the 
influenza B strain predominantly circulating in the community in any given season, which for the northern 
hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines occurred in 5 of the 10 influenza seasons 2001/2002 to 
2010/2011. In order to avoid vaccine mismatch, quadrivalent influenza vaccines that include influenza B 
strains from both lineages have been recommended and these are expected to provide protection against 
the additional B strain. The first QIV was approved in the United States of America (US) prior to the 
2012/13 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. A US study estimated that, in a season with a B strain 
mismatch, availability of quadrivalent influenza virus vaccines could reduce annual influenza cases 
(range: 2200–970,000), hospitalizations (range: 14–8200), and deaths (range: 1–485) in the US.  
QIVc is a quadrivalent vaccine including B strains of both lineages and is therefore expected to improve 
protection in target populations, especially in children where significant disease due to influenza B strains 
occurs and the potential for vaccine B strain mismatch has existed with trivalent influenza virus vaccines. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 8/67 
 
 
  
  
QIVc is manufactured through cell-based manufacturing processes that are consistent with those used for 
the US-approved TIVc, Flucelvax, and the formerly (until June 2017) EU-approved TIVc, Optaflu. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus that can be classified into 3 biologically similar, but antigenically 
different types, A, B, and C, of which type A and B viruses are the most clinically significant. The influenza 
type A virus can be further divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) 
surface glycoprotein antigens. The subtype refers to major antigenic variation with respect to the HA and/or 
NA virion antigens. Of the influenza type A virus subtypes, the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes are the most 
clinically important for annual influenza disease burden. Influenza type B viruses show extensive variation 
in  antigenicity.  Although  no  true  B  subtype  is  known  to  exist,  during  the  early  part  of  the  1980s,  2 
antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B emerged: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.  
The 3 influenza virus types share no common virus-coded antigens and differ in epidemiology and to some 
degree in the severity of illness caused.  
Management 
There  is  no  effective  treatment  for  influenza,  and  clinical  management  is  based  mostly  on  symptomatic 
treatment. Few antiviral drugs are available which may be able to reduce disease severity and duration, 
but  they  need  to  be  taken  soon  after  infection  in  order  to  be  effective  and  can  induce  drug-resistant 
mutants.  Influenza  antivirals  target  the  viral  NA  protein  (zanamivir  and  oseltamivir),  or  the  M2  protein 
(amantadine and rimantadine). The latter two are no longer recommended due to high level of resistance 
(>99%)  in  circulating  viruses  since  2009.  Viruses  resistant  to  the  NA  inhibitors  have  also  increased 
dramatically  after  2007  with  the  majority  of  seasonal  H1N1  viruses  (pre-pandemic  2009)  exhibiting 
oseltamivir resistance.  
Influenza can be complicated by bacterial superinfections, which are managed by specific treatments.  
The  most  effective  tool  against  influenza  is  prevention  by  vaccination.  Influenza  virus  is  known  for  its 
antigenic variability, essentially at the level of the surface proteins HA and NA, which is mostly driven by 
the selective pressure of the immune system on the virus quasispecies that is infecting an individual. This 
mechanism is due to the selection of genetic mutations in the viral genes and it’s called antigenic drift. This 
is the reason why vaccines against seasonal influenza may need to be updated in composition on a yearly 
basis to include the latest circulating viruses and why people need to get vaccinated accordingly.  
The protection afforded by conventional inactivated influenza vaccines is driven by how well the strains in 
the vaccine match the viruses that circulate during influenza season (antigenic match).  
2.1.2.  About the product 
QIVc is a quadrivalent surface antigen, inactivated, influenza vaccine, prepared in Madin Darby Canine 
Kidney (MDCK) cell cultures. The active substance comprises virus surface antigens (hemagglutinin and 
neuraminidase) of the 4 strains of influenza virus recommended annually by the WHO for the Northern 
Hemisphere season:  
- 
- 
- 
a strain A (H1N1);  
a strain A (H3N2);  
a strain B (Yamagata lineage);  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 9/67 
 
 
  
  
- 
a strain B (Victoria lineage). 
QIVc is manufactured using a suspension of a MDCK cell line, rather than in embryonated hen eggs as 
with traditional influenza vaccine manufacturing. One 0.5 mL dose of QIVc consists of a sterile suspension 
for intramuscular injection containing approximately 15 µg HA from each of the 4 influenza strains 
(A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strains from both Victoria and Yamagata lineages; 60 µg in total). QIVc will be 
available in a single dose prefilled syringe presentation. 
The cell-based production process of “on demand” suspensions of cells does not require medium 
supplements, is maintained in a closed, sterile system during all production steps, and is based on a 
mammalian rather than avian cell line and therefore may lead to better antigenic matching with 
circulating human strains. The shift from eggs to cell culture allows work directly with wild-type viruses, 
avoids the generation of egg-adaptive mutations in the HA protein, increases surge capacity in the event 
of a pandemic, and provides better manufacturing control through a closed-system fermentation process. 
Furthermore, the use of a mammalian cell line for viral replication is a serum-free manufacturing process 
and removes the use of antibiotics. QIVc is produced using the same cell culture manufacturing platform 
as TIVc. 
TIVc  was  approved  in  the  EU  in  June  2007,  under  the  tradename  of  Optaflu.  One  0.5  mL  dose  of  TIVc 
contains  approximately  15  µg  HA  from  each  of  the  3  influenza  strains  –  A/H1N1,  A/H3N2  and  B  (either 
Victoria or Yamagata lineage). TIVc was approved by the FDA in November 2012, for use in adults ≥18 
years of age. The age indication for the US-licensed TIVc was extended in May 2016 for use in children ≥4 
years of age. 
QIVc  was  approved  in  the  US  in  May  2016  via  the  accelerated  approval  pathway  for  use  in  adults  and 
children of ≥4 years, with the post-approval requirement to conduct a paediatric absolute efficacy study. 
QIVc is currently approved in the EU, under the name of Flucelvax Tetra, since December 2018, for the 
prophylaxis of influenza in adults and children from 9 years of age.   
QIVc and TIVc were originally developed and marketed by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics GmbH (NVD). 
In  December  2016  the  marketing  authorisation  for  Optaflu  was  transferred  to  Seqirus  GmbH.  The 
registration for Optaflu expired in June 2017 for commercial reasons, so TIVc is no longer authorised in 
Europe. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Study V130_12 was conducted in 8 countries (Australia, Philippines, Thailand, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, 
Poland and Spain) over 3 influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 [Season 1], Northern 
Hemisphere 2017-2018 [Season 2], and Northern Hemisphere 2018-2019 [Season 3]). The study is 
registered with EudraCT (2016-002883-15) and the results were submitted within 6 months of the 30 
September 2019 end of study date, in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No. 
1901/2006. The design of V130_12 has been previously discussed with EMA at meetings held in 2016 and 
2017, and it was also discussed during paediatric investigation plan (PIP) with PDCO. 
The V130_12 study was conducted in accordance with the CBER Guidance for Industry: Clinical data 
needed to support the licensure of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines (CBER 2007) and the EMA 
Guideline on Influenza Vaccines Non-clinical and Clinical Modules (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). The 
study fulfils the product’s US FDA postmarketing study requirement (PMR No. 1) to demonstrate absolute 
vaccine efficacy (aVE) in children 4 to < 18 years of age. In addition, children ≥2 years of age were 
enrolled in this study to further evaluate QIVc in a broader age range and to support submissions in 
various global regions.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that clinical study V130_12 was designed, implemented, and reported on in accordance 
with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations 
including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, and Japanese Ministry 
of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Seqirus codes on protection of human rights, and with the ethical 
principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The study was conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice (GCP), and applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
No GCP inspections are considered necessary. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
QIVc was initially granted marketing approval in the US for use in persons 4 years of age and older on 23 
May 2016.  Marketing authorisation was also granted for QIVc in Europe in December 2018 and in Canada 
in November 2019 for use in people 9 years and older and in Brazil for use in people 18 years and older 
in February 2020. Approval was based on non-inferior immunogenicity and safety of QIVc against the 
trivalent formulation of the vaccine TIVc, in adults (V130_01) and children 4 to < 18 years of age 
(V130_03) and demonstration of efficacy of the trivalent formulation (V58P12) in adults and 
immunogenicity in children 3 to < 18 years of age (V58P13).   
While the US FDA considered QIVc approved in adults without a further postmarketing requirement, 
approval in children between 4 and < 18 years of age was granted in accordance with the US regulations 
for accelerated approval. Final approval under these regulations was dependent on successful 
demonstration of the clinical benefit in an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in children 4 to < 18 
years of age. The design of the V130_12 postmarketing requirement study was revised to include children 
2 to < 4 years of age to also support the registration of the vaccine in children 2 years and older in other 
regions globally.   
When the marketing authorisation was submitted for QIVc in Europe in December 2018, the indication 
sought by the MAH was the prevention of influenza in children 4 years of age and older and adults.  
The following studies were presented to support the claimed indication: 
- 
Two phase III studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy (immunogenicity) of the QIVc 
in children 4 to < 18 years of age (V130_03 study) and in adults 18 to > 75 years of age 
(V130_01 study). 
-  Supportive data on absolute vaccine efficacy obtained from TIVc (study V58P13 in adults 18-
49YOA), and additional supportive immunogenicity data obtained with TIVc vaccine (V58P12 in 
children 3-18YOA).  
- 
To provide, as a post-approval commitment, the data from an additional efficacy study (V130_12) 
including subjects from 2 to < 18 years of age, which was ongoing at the time of MAA, to support 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 11/67 
 
 
  
  
the claimed indication from 4 to <18 years of age. The conduction of this study was a 
commitment (for both FDA and CHMP) to approve the current clinical data package.   
Upon assessment of these data the adult indication was granted without any issue. Regarding the 
paediatric indication (4 to 18 years of age), the CHMP was not convinced that the data presented at that 
moment were sufficiently conclusive, and thus the CHMP requested the Vaccine Working Party (VWP) to 
address this issue before reaching a conclusion on the Flucelvax Tetra application.  
No efficacy data were generated with QIVc in any age group. Therefore, in order to support a conclusion 
on the likely efficacy of QIVc in the paediatric population aged 4-<18 years, the MAH proposed an 
immunobridging approach. In principle, this indirect immunobridging approach was considered valid by 
the VWP. But in the group aged 4 to <9 YOA, the co-primary objective of this non-inferiority study was 
not met for the GMT ratios and SCRs against A/H3N2 when sera were tested with the cell-based antigen 
HI assay. When egg-base antigens were used in the HI assay to test the same sera, immune responses to 
the A/H3N2 and B strains did not meet the non-inferiority criteria.  
Overall, the VWP considered there were some remaining uncertainties regarding the adequacy of the 
immune responses to A/H3N2 and B strains documented in the study used for non-inferior comparisons in 
the age subset 4 to 8 years. The VWP was not convinced that the available immunogenicity data could 
support approval in this age group.  
As a result of the assessment, the indication granted for the initial marketing authorisation included 
adults and children 9 years of age and above.  
Within this application, the MAH has now submitted the results of the V130_12 study, in support of an 
indication for prevention of influenza in adults and children from 2 years of age and older. These results 
provide data from clinical study V130_12 (NCT03165617), a Phase 3/4 efficacy, immunogenicity and 
safety study in children 2 to < 18 years of age to support the extension of the indication of QIVc for 
prevention of influenza in adults and children from 2 years of age.  The design of V130_12 was previously 
discussed with EMA at meetings held in 2016 and 2017, and it was also discussed during paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP) negotiations with PDCO. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

separated by 28  days; the comparator vaccine  group received comparator  on Day 1 followed by a saline placebo  vaccine on Day 29, 
whereas the QIVc group received 2 QIVc vaccinations on Days 1 and 29. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  dedicated  studies  for  the  assessment  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  product  were  performed.  This 
approach is endorsed due to the nature of the product under evaluation. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
QIVc provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two B types) 
contained in the vaccine by inducing humoral antibodies against the haemagglutinin proteins. These 
antibodies neutralise influenza viruses.  
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity profile, as detailed in the 
CHMP guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In Study V130_12, immunogenicity endpoints were assessed by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and 
microneuralization (MN) assay for all strains. 
The HI assay used for immunogenicity evaluation of influenza vaccines is considered adequate for the 
V130_12 QIVc study, because it is in line with the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). The MAH states that in recent years it has been observed that H3 
viruses have decreased replicative capacity on MDCK cells and can poorly agglutinate RBC of different 
species. Therefore, an alternative method for the antigenic typing of H3 viruses was developed based on 
the ViroSpot methodology and detection of viral NP protein rather than agglutinating activity. This assay 
can be used for the typing and subtyping of influenza. The qualitative ViroSpot assay for antigenic typing 
that were used for typing H3N2 isolates is based on a quantitative microneutralization assay. As

performed for antigenic typing of Influenza viruses using the conventional HI assay, the MN titres 
obtained from the viruses isolated from clinical specimens were compared to the MN titre obtained with 
the reference vaccine strain when using a ferret anti-serum obtained from an animal infected with the 
reference vaccine strain. The ViroSpot for antigenic matching is a qualitative assay and its output is either 
a non-matching, “UNMATCH” or matching, “MATCH” status compared to the reference corresponding 
vaccine strain. 
It should be mentioned that the MAH has stated that differences in the immunological response measured 
by HI against Type A/H3N2 in Season 2 compared to Season 3 were noted, with nearly 4-fold higher 
baseline titre against Type A/H3N2 observed. In recent years, genetic changes in the HA of circulating 
and vaccine virus strains of A/H3N2 have resulted in the loss of capacity to agglutinate chicken or turkey 
erythrocytes (van Baalen et al. 2014). This was the case for the A/H3N2 strain used in the vaccine in 
Season 2 (A/Singapore/GP2050/2015) and thus the HI assay might not have reliably measured the 
immunogenicity against this virus strain. The HI assay in Season 2 used guinea pig red blood cells 
without oseltamivir. Under these testing conditions, haemagglutination was predominantly due to 
neuraminidase (NA) and therefore the assay has measured mostly anti-NA antibodies (Mögling et al. 
2017). Therefore, the HI results observed in Season 2 for the A/H3N2 strains should be considered less 
reliable. In addition, the use of erythrocytes from different species in Seasons 2 and 3 might also explain 
the differences in baseline titres across these seasons (Makkoch et al. 2012, Trombetta et al. 2018). 
In Season 3 the A/North Carolina 04/2016 (H3N2) vaccine strain regained the capacity for 
hemagglutination through HA and the testing was done using turkey RBCs, not guinea pig. The 
interpretation of the data should therefore be consistent with the standard HI assay (Ovsyannikova et al. 
2014). Unfortunately, the A/North Carolina 04/2016 (H3N2) virus had an unusually low hemagglutination 
titre which appears to have reduced the sensitivity of the assay (more virus particles to make 1 
hemagglutination unit) and may explain the low HI GMT postvaccination. 
It should be mentioned that HI and MN titres are not a true surrogate marker in the sense that there is 
not a globally accepted cut-off titre that defines clinical protection. Nonetheless, it has been widely shown 
that higher titres tend to correlate with better protection. 
Since the QIVc is propagated in a mammalian cell line rather than in embryonated hens' eggs (differently 
than the conventional influenza vaccines), it is considered adequate that the HI assays had been 
performed using test antigens propagated in MDCK cells (mammalian cell culture-derived test antigens) 
rather than antigens from virus grown in eggs.  
The MAH states that all sera were tested in a single clinical serology laboratory in line with the 
recommendations of the current CHMP influenza vaccines guideline, this is adequate. 
Two validation reports of the HI test were included in the variation application. All validations were carried 
out according to ICH guidelines Q2A and Q2B, and covered additional strains of the four seasonal 
influenza virus types H3N2, H1N1, B Yamagata and B Victoria. The parameters assessed were precision, 
format variability, dilutional linearity, relative accuracy, specificity and lower limit of quantification. All 
acceptance criteria defined in the analysis validation plan were well achieved, and therefore it is 
concluded that the HI test was well validated. 
Additionally, two validation reports of the MN test were included in the variation application. All 
validations were carried out according to ICH guidelines Q2A and Q2B, and covered additional strains of 
the four seasonal influenza virus types H3N2, H1N1, B Yamagata and B Victoria. The parameters 
assessed were precision, format variability, dilutional linearity, relative accuracy, specificity and lower 
limit of quantification. All acceptance criteria defined in the analysis validation plan were well achieved, 
and therefore it is concluded that the MN test was well validated.

In light of the technical challenges with the HI assay, quantification of neutralizing antibody titres using 
the MN assay against Type A/H3N2 has been used as an alternative. This aspect was discussed with 
PDCO and has been agreed as part of the PIP. 
The explanation of the observed problem and the solution implemented are satisfactory. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No clinical pharmacology studies were performed in the clinical development program to support the 
extension of indication of Flucelvax Tetra. This approach is endorsed due to the nature of the product 
under evaluation. 
The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay used for immunogenicity evaluation of influenza vaccines is 
considered adequate for the V130_12 QIVc study, because it is in line with the Guideline on Influenza 
Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
In light of the technical challenges with the HI assay, particularly with the A/H3N2 strain used in the 
vaccine in Season 2 (A/Singapore/GP2050/2015), quantification of neutralizing antibody titres using the 
MN assay against Type A/H3N2 has been used as an alternative. The explanation of the observed problem 
and the solution implemented by the MAH are satisfactory. 
Therefore, it is considered that all aspects dealing with clinical pharmacology have been well addressed. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Vaccine dosage and schedule 
In clinical Study V130_12 carried out in children 2 to < 18 years of age, QIVc was administered as a 
0.5mL intramuscular injection in either a single or two dose vaccination regimen. The vaccination regimen 
for each subject was determined on the basis of the subject’s age and previous influenza vaccination 
history, according to the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) paediatric influenza 
vaccine dosing recommendations (Grohskopf et al., 2015), and other international dosing 
recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccines.  
Vaccine Formulation 
The influenza viral strains used in the vaccines of the QIVc clinical trial (CT) complied with the annual 
recommendations made by the WHO (WHO 2013) at the time the trial was performed, and were also the 
same recommended by the FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) 
in the US and by the CHMP in the EU.  
Dose-response studies 
The dose-finding studies were conducted for the initial submission. 
Conclusion on the dose-response study 
Within this application, no dose-finding studies were conducted since the vaccine composition and dosing 
are based on the Guideline on Influenza vaccines – Quality module (EMA/CHMP/BWP/310834/2012 
Rev.1), and the vaccine compositions are in line with the antigen dose of other seasonal inactivated non-
adjuvanted influenza vaccines. This is considered acceptable.

2.4.2.  Main study 
This application includes data for children 2 to < 18 years of age, in Study V130_12, to seek approval for 
use of QIVc in children 2 years of age and older. 
Study V130_12: A Phase III/IV, Stratified, Randomized, Observer Blind, Multicentre Clinical 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of a Cell-Based Quadrivalent 
Subunit Influenza Virus Vaccine Compared to Non-Influenza Comparator Vaccine in Subjects 
≥2 Years to <18 Years of Age 
Methods 
Study participants 
Planned: Approximately 7692 healthy male and female subjects between 2 and <18 years of age were 
planned to be enrolled, randomized 1:1 between QIVc and the comparator group (receiving a non-
influenza licensed Menveo vaccine), over a minimum of 3 influenza seasons. A subset of subjects was 
required to provide a blood sample and immunogenicity assessments were to be conducted. The subset 
was to comprise a total of maximum 444 subjects per season in the 2 to <9 years of age cohort for the 
second and for the third season. 
Analysed: A total of 4514 subjects 2 to <18 years of age were enrolled and randomized into the study to 
receive QIVc or comparator vaccine. Of these, 4513 subjects were exposed to study treatments (2258 
received QIVc and 2255 received comparator). In total, 721 subjects 2 to <9 years of age were included 
in the immunogenicity analyses (364 received QIVc and 357 received comparator).

liquid. The dose administered was 0.5 ml. Vaccination was performed intramuscularly, preferably in the 
deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm.  
The active substance consisted of 15 μg of HA of each of the four viral strains recommended by the WHO 
and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the 2017 season in the Southern 
Hemisphere, and seasons 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.

after the last vaccination and until the end of the influenza season.   
Immunogenicity 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
The immunogenicity of study vaccine was assessed 21 days after the last vaccine administration by 
measuring the HI assay to the 4 viral strains included in the vaccine. The measures for assessing 
immunogenicity as determined by HI were as follows:  
•  HI Geometric mean titres (GMTs) on Day 1 (all subjects), Day 22 (all “previously vaccinated” 
subjects receiving a single vaccine dose) or Days 29 and 50 (all “not previously vaccinated” subjects 
receiving 2 doses) for all 4 influenza strains.  
• 
Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion (defined as: either a prevaccination HI titre <1:10 
and a postvaccination HI titre ≥1:40 or a prevaccination HI titre ≥1:10 and a ≥4 fold increase in 
postvaccination HI titre) on Day 22 (all “previously vaccinated” subjects receiving a single vaccine 
dose) or Days 29 and 50 (all “not previously vaccinated” subjects receiving 2 doses) for all 4 
influenza strains.  
•  HI Geometric mean ratio (GMR): of Day 22/Day 1 (all “previously vaccinated” subjects receiving a 
single vaccine dose) or Day 29/Day 1 and Day 50/Day 1 (all “not previously vaccinated” subjects 
receiving 2 doses) for all 4 influenza strains.  
• 
Percentage of subjects with HI titre ≥1:40 on Day 22 (all “previously vaccinated” subjects receiving 
a single vaccine dose) or Days 29 and 50 (all “not previously vaccinated” subjects receiving 2 doses) 
for all 4 influenza strains.  
Exploratory Immunogenicity Endpoint:  
In the event of additional immunogenicity analyses, such as MN, the immune response was characterized 
in a similar manner as described in the secondary immunogenicity endpoints. 
Sample size 
This study was planned using a group sequential design, with one or more interim analyses for efficacy 
using O’Brien-Fleming efficacy bounds. The statistical test performed depended only on the number of 
confirmed ILI cases (events), so the sample size estimate was only for operational reasons (an estimate 
of number of subjects needed to assess the endpoint). 
Primary Efficacy Objective ≥2 years to <18 years of age 
Estimated sample size to arrive at 298 events, is 4,814 evaluable subjects (or 2,407 evaluable subjects 
per treatment group), assuming attack rate in non-influenza comparator vaccine subjects of 8%, vaccine 
efficacy of 45%, and the risk of infection contained entirely within period covered by follow-up. 
Accounting for early dropout and uncertainty about the assumed parameters, 5,349 subjects are planned 
to be enrolled to demonstrate that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the VE is greater than 20% 
for the primary endpoint assessment, with approximately 90% power. 
Co-primary Efficacy Objective ≥3 years to <18 years of age 
Assuming a true vaccine efficacy of 50% it was calculated that approximately 381 observed confirmed ILI 
cases would be needed to demonstrate that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the VE is greater 
than 30% with approximately 90% power. The statistical test performed will depend only on number of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020

confirmed ILI cases (events), so sample size estimate is only for operational reasons. Estimated sample 
size to arrive at 381 events, is 6,350 evaluable subjects (or 3,175 evaluable subjects per treatment 
group), assuming attack rate in non-influenza comparator vaccine subjects of 8%, assumed vaccine 
efficacy of 50%, VE is greater than 30%, and the risk of infection contained entirely within period covered 
by follow-up. Accounting for early dropout and uncertainty about the assumed parameters, 7,056 
subjects are planned to be enrolled to demonstrate that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the 
VE is greater than 30%. 
Table 2 summarizes the power calculations assumptions and the number of events required to meet 
primary and co-primary endpoint. 
Table 2: Power calculation for Primary and Co-primary endpoints 
Randomisation 
A total of 4514 subjects 2 to <18 years of age were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to QIVc or 
non-influenza comparator vaccine, Menveo, a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, W-135, Y conjugate 
vaccine. The randomization was stratified by age (2 to < 9 years and 9 to < 18 years). Subjects between 
2 to < 9 years of age were further stratified by previous influenza vaccine status. Study subjects were 
scheduled to receive either a single dose of 0.5 mL of the study vaccine or a two dose study vaccination 
regimen separated by approximately 4 weeks as clinically indicated depending on age and previous 
influenza vaccination history according to paediatric influenza vaccine dosing recommendations 
(Grohskopf et al., 2015) and consistent with international guidelines.  
Blinding

•  Overall Safety Set: All subjects who are in the Solicited Safety Set and/or Unsolicited Safety Set. 
Analysis of Efficacy: 
(Co-)primary VE analyses were based on the Efficacy FAS and repeated on the Efficacy PPS. 
The primary measure of efficacy was the estimate of aVE of QIVc relative to the non-influenza comparator 
vaccine for preventing first-occurrence influenza-confirmed disease by either RT-PCR-confirmed or 
culture-confirmed influenza strains contained in QIVc and the non-influenza comparator, regardless of 
antigenic match. 
A time-to-event methodology based on a proportional hazard model was used for all efficacy analyses. 
aVE against first or only confirmed influenza cases was determined using a standard formula: aVE = 1 - 
HR where HR is the hazard ratio for influenza confirmed (either RT-PCR-confirmed or culture-confirmed) 
ILI in the QIVc group versus the non-influenza comparator group. The HR was estimated by a 
proportional hazards regression model for which the following null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses 
were tested: 
H0: 1 – HR ≤ 0.2 versus H1: 1 – HR >0.2 
where HR is a hazard ratio of QIVc versus non-influenza comparator and VE is vaccine efficacy. The 
primary objective was achieved if the LL of the 2-sided CI of the VE estimate, with at least 95% coverage 
in a multiple sequential hypothesis testing, exceeded 0.2 in subjects 2 to <18 years of age.

The co-primary objective was achieved if the LL of the 2-sided CI of the VE estimate, with at least 95% 
coverage in a multiple sequential hypothesis testing, exceeded 0.3 in subjects 3 to <18 years of age. 
The model used to estimate aVE for the secondary efficacy objectives was similar to the model used for 
the primary efficacy objectives. 
Immunogenicity: 
Immunogenicity analyses were based on the Immunogenicity FAS and repeated on the Immunogenicity 
PPS. 
All statistical analyses for HI titres were performed on the logarithmically (base 10) transformed values. 
Individual HI titres below the detection limit (<10) were set to half of that limit (5). 
Both adjusted and unadjusted estimates for GMTs, GMRs and pertaining 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated 
assuming log-normal distribution of the titres and were completed by providing minimum, maximum and 
median titres for each vaccine group. 
Binary data (i.e., percentages of subjects with seroconversion and with titre ≥1:40) were summarized for 
each group and were reported together with 2-sided 95% CIs calculated according to Clopper and 
Pearson (1934). No multiplicity adjustment to the CI levels were implemented. 
For immunogenicity data, it was reasonable to consider missing immunogenicity values as missing 
completely at random, i.e., not informative. Therefore, the key secondary analysis was a complete case 
analysis only, without introducing any bias. Imputation methods were not used.

Participant flow 
A total of 4514 subjects were enrolled in Study V130_12. The population used for the efficacy analysis 
was the Efficacy Full Analysis Set (FAS) which included all enrolled subjects that were randomized, 
received at least one study vaccination and provided efficacy data. Five enrolled subjects were excluded 
from the Efficacy, FAS population. Efficacy analysis were repeated with the Efficacy Per Protocol Set (PPS) 
which included all FAS subjects that correctly received the vaccines, had no protocol deviations leading to 
exclusion and were not excluded due to other reasons defined prior to unblinding or analysis. In total, 9 
(0.4%) subjects in the QIVc group and 9 (0.4%) subjects in the comparator group were withdrawn from 
the study. The number of enrolled subjects and disposition by age cohort and study treatment are shown

Baseline data 
Overall 2395 subjects (53.1%) were enrolled in Southern Hemisphere countries and 2119 (46.9%) in 
Northern Hemisphere countries. The majority of subjects were enrolled in Season 1 (n=2395; 53.1%) 
with most subjects from the Philippines (n=1800). In Season 2, 919 subjects (20.4%) were enrolled in 
Estonia and Finland and 1200 (26.6%) in Season 3. Both in Season 2 and 3 the majority of subjects were 
enrolled in Estonia (Season 2: n=600; Season 3: n=598).  
The population was well balanced between the sexes (48.5% female and 51.5% male). All subjects were 
between 2 and 18 years of age in agreement with the intended study population. The overall mean (SD) 
age was 8.8 (4.1) years. Approximately half of the study population (50.7%) was between 2 to <9 years 
of age. The youngest age category (between 2 to <4 years of age) comprised 9.6% of the study 
population. 
Overall, the majority (65.9%) of subjects (n=4514) were previously vaccinated against influenza. Of the 
subjects 2 to <9 years of age (n=2289), 32.8% were previously vaccinated against influenza. All of the 
subjects 9 to <18 years of age (100%) were categorized as previously vaccinated against influenza as 
age (9 to <18 years of age) was used as stratify these subjects to receive 1 dose of study vaccine. There 
was no notable difference in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, 
ethnic origin or country of enrolment) between the 2 vaccine groups in the All Enrolled Set, nor was any 
difference between the 2 to <18 (n=4514) and 3 to <18 years of age (n=4414) cohorts.

Efficacy Population, Study V130_12  
A total of 4514 subjects were enrolled in Study V130_12. The population used for the efficacy analysis 
was the Efficacy Full Analysis Set (FAS) which included all enrolled subjects that were randomized, 
received at least one study vaccination and provided efficacy data. Five enrolled subjects were excluded 
from the Efficacy, FAS population. Efficacy analysis were repeated with the Efficacy Per Protocol Set (PPS) 
which included all FAS subjects that correctly received the vaccines, had no protocol deviations leading to 
exclusion and were not excluded due to other reasons defined prior to unblinding or analysis.  
Immunogenicity Population, Study V130_12  
The population used for the immunogenicity analysis based on the HI and MN assay was the FAS 
Immunogenicity. This population was defined as all enrolled subjects aged 2 to < 9 years that were 
randomized, received at least one study vaccination and provided HI assay immunogenicity data at 
baseline and after last vaccination. The PPS immunogenicity population was the same as the FAS but 
excluded subjects with protocol deviations leading to exclusion or due to other reasons defined prior to 
unblinding or analysis.  
The subject populations are presented in the following table:

Outcomes and estimation 
EFFICACY 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to demonstrate the absolute vaccine efficacy of QIVc 
versus a non-influenza comparator determined by the first occurrence of RT-PCR or culture-confirmed 
influenza due to any influenza Type A and B strain in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 26/67 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The primary efficacy objective was successfully demonstrated; therefore, the co-primary efficacy 
objective was assessed. This objective was to demonstrate the absolute vaccine efficacy of QIVc versus a 
non-influenza comparator determined by first occurrence RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza, due to 
any influenza Type A and B strain in subjects 3 to < 18 years of age. The co-primary endpoint was tested 
sequentially without adjustment of Type I error for the population. 
The primary and co-primary efficacy endpoints were defined as the time from the last study vaccination 
to the onset of the first occurrence of RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza, due to any influenza Type 
A or B strain, and regardless of an antigenic match to the strains selected for the seasonal vaccine that 
occurred more than 14 days after the last vaccination until the end of the influenza season. The primary 
and co-primary endpoints were met if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the absolute vaccine 
efficacy estimate was greater than 20% (primary endpoint) or greater than 30% (co-primary endpoint) 
using the protocol definition of ILI for the entire age range. The primary and co-primary were assessed in 
the FAS Efficacy.  
In the FAS Efficacy, for 539 of the 4509 subjects 2 to < 18 years of age RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed 
influenza caused by any Type A or Type B strain were observed, i.e., in 175 subjects in the QIVc group 
(7.8%) and 364 subjects in the comparator group (16.2%) (Table 6). 
The analysis shows that QIVc prevented RT-PCR or culture confirmed influenza caused by any Type A or B 
strain in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age (primary efficacy endpoint) and 3 to < 18 years of age (co-
primary endpoint). The VE of QIVc in children 2 to < 18 years of age was 54.6% (95% CI: 45.7 to 62.1). 
The success criterion was met as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI was above 20%. The VE of QIVc in 
children 3 to < 18 years of age was 54.0% (95% CI: 44.8 to 61.7). The success criterion was met as the 
LL of 95% CI for VE is above 30% (Table 6).

influenza and absolute vaccine efficacy (95% CI), Overall in subjects 2 to <18 Years of age

SECONDARY  OBJECTIVES were intended to demonstrate the absolute vaccine efficacy of QIVc versus a 
non-influenza comparator determined by the first occurrence of either RT-PCR- and/or culture-confirmed 
influenza due to any Type A and B strain, and culture-confirmed antigenically matched to the vaccine 
strains. These endpoints were evaluated in different age cohorts of 2 to <4, 4 to < 18, 2 to < 9, and 9 to 
< 18 years of age.

Subjects 2 to <4 years of age:  In subjects 2 to <4 years of age, the overall VE of QIVc against RT-
PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza was 62.66% (95% CI: 38.06; 77.49).  For further details see 
table 7. 
Subjects 4 to <18 years of age: In subjects 4 to <18 years of age, the overall VE of QIVc against any 
RT-PCR- or culture- confirmed influenza was 53.33% (95% CI: 43.38; 61.54). For further details see

Subjects 2 to <9 years of age: In subjects 2 to <9 years of age, the overall VE of QIVc against any RT-
PCR- or culture- confirmed influenza was 50.51% (95% CI: 38.43; 60.22). These results are detailed in 
the following Table 8. 
Subjects 9 to <18 years of age: In subjects 9 to <18 years of age, the overall VE of QIVc against any 
RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza was 61.85% (95% CI: 47.37; 72.34). See results in the following

VE estimates for the 2 to < 18 and 3 to < 18 years of age groups related to the secondary efficacy 
endpoints (RT-PCR-confirmed, culture-confirmed, matched) are also presented in Table 9. Additionally, 
VE estimates against culture-confirmed antigenically unmatched to the vaccine strains are included. 
Secondary Efficacy Objective 1: Vaccine Efficacy for RT-PCR- or Culture-Confirmed Influenza Regardless 
of Antigenic Match – By Strain Type and Age. Out of the 539 subjects with a RT-PCR- or culture confirmed 
influenza caused by any Type A or Type B strain, there were 310 episodes caused by Type A and 231 
caused by Type B.  See table 9. 
Secondary Efficacy Objective 2: Vaccine Efficacy for RT- PCR-Confirmed Influenza Regardless of Antigenic 
Match. The estimates of the overall VE of QIVc against RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 31/67 
 
 
  
  
 
 
comparison to the estimates of the overall VE against RT-PCR confirmed influenza are similar. The strain 
specific VE estimates differ slightly as the RT-PCR method was unable to determine the strain type of 29 
influenza Type A strains, and therefore there were fewer Type A/H1N1 and Type A/H3N2 results by this 
method (Table 9).  
Secondary Efficacy Objective 3: Vaccine Efficacy for Culture-Confirmed Influenza Regardless of Antigenic 
Match. In subjects 2 to < 18 and 3 to < 18 years of age, absolute vaccine efficacy of QIVc versus the 
comparator was demonstrated as determined by the first occurrence of culture-confirmed influenza due 
to any influenza Type A and B strains regardless of antigenic match (Table 9).   
 Secondary Efficacy Objective 4: Vaccine Efficacy for Culture-Confirmed Influenza Antigenically Matched. 
In subjects 2 to < 18 years of age, absolute vaccine efficacy of QIVc versus the comparator was 
demonstrated as determined by the first occurrence of culture-confirmed influenza due to antigenically 
matched influenza Type A and B strains. No differences were observed between subjects 2 to < 18 years 
of age and 3 to < 18 years of age. (See Table 9).

Other Efficacy Endpoints 
The exploratory evaluation of QIVc efficacy to prevent the 2 pre-specified complications of influenza, 
pneumonia and otitis media, was inconclusive [LL of the 2-sided 95% CI encompassing zero]. Number of 
subjects with first occurrence pneumonia and otitis were derived from AE forms and reported as medically

attended AE reported within 30 days after ILI onset. The VE of QIVc relative to non-influenza comparator 
to prevent all-cause pneumonia and all-cause otitis media was not statistically significant.

media occurring at >14 days after the last vaccination AND until the end of the influenza 
season in subjects 2 to <18 years of age – FAS Efficacy 
IMMUNOGENICITY  
The immunogenicity objectives were evaluated using the immunogenicity subset of subjects. The analysis 
was based on the FAS Immunogenicity. 
SECONDARY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:  
The secondary immunogenicity objective was to characterize the immunogenicity of QIVc by 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI assay) 3 weeks after the last vaccination in a subset of 751 subjects 2 to 
< 9 years of age, who were enrolled in Season 2 (n=432) and Season 3 (n=319). From those, 721 
(n=422 [Season 2]; n=299 [Season 3]) were included in the FAS Immunogenicity. 
Immunogenicity were assessed at baseline (Day 1; all subjects in immunogenicity subset), at Day 22 (all 
“previously vaccinated” subjects receiving a single dose of the study vaccine), and at Days 29 and 50 (all 
“not previously vaccinated” subjects receiving 2 doses) for all 4 influenza strains using the HI assay. 
The vaccine strain composition changed between seasons. Except for the Type A/H1N1 vaccine strain, all 
other vaccine strains (Type A/H3N2, Type B/Yamagata and Type B/Victoria) were updated. Therefore, all 
the immunogenicity results are presented by season, even in the case where the strain did not change 
(i.e. A/H1N1). For each assay and strain, the following measures were derived: GMTs, GMR,  
seroconversion rates, and the percentages of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40. Immunogenicity was 
analysed descriptively and no success criteria were applied. 
HI Geometric Mean Titres and Geometric Mean Ratios 
The GMTs at Days 1, and 22/50 and GMR by vaccine groups are presented in Table 11. The GMT showed 
that: 
•  Overall there were no differences in GMT at Day 1 between QIVc and comparator. 
•  Across seasons, the GMTs at Day 1 were lowest against Type B/Victoria and B/Yamagata 
compared to the Type A/H1N1 and Type A/H3N2. 
• 
• 
The GMTs at Day 1 against Type A/H1N1 and Type B/Victoria were comparable between Season 2 
and 3. 
The GMTs at Day 1 against Type A/H3N2 were higher for Season 2 compared with Season 3 
(prevaccination GMTs, Season 2: 97.02 [QIVc], 94.40 [comparator] versus Season 3: 20.85 
[QIVc], 20.74 [comparator]). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 34/67 
 
 
  
  
 
• 
The GMTs at Day 1 against Type B/Yamagata were higher in Season 3 compared with Season 2 
(prevaccination GMTs, Season 2: 10.87 [QIVc], 12.17 [comparator] versus Season 3: 23.98 
[QIVc] and 27.33 [comparator]). 
There was a robust and substantial immune response across the 2 seasons in subjects who received 
QIVc; even with seasonal differences in vaccine strains and baseline GMTs. 
The GMR showed: 
• 
The GMR obtained for QIVc were higher than those for the comparator, with the notable 
exception of A/H3N2 in Season 2. A potential explanation is provided later in this section in the 
paragraphs titled “Type A/H3N2 responses”. 
•  GMRs for QIVc by season were 5.76 and 9.73 for A/H1N1, 1.74 and 4.14 for A/H3N2, 3.79 and 
7.01 for B/Victoria, and 4.63 and 5.27 for B/Yamagata in Season 2 and Season 3, respectively. 
•  GMR for the comparator ranged between 0.99 and 1.25. 
Consistent with the GMT results, post-vaccination HI titres were significantly higher in the QIVc group 
versus the comparator group for all strains (Table 11). The results obtained for PPS Immunogenicity were 
consistent with results obtained in the FAS. 
Percentage of Subjects with an HI Titre ≥1:40 
Table 11 presents the proportion of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1 and Day 22/50 in the FAS 
Immunogenicity analysis. 
•  Overall there were no differences in subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1 between QIVc and the 
comparator. 
•  Across seasons, the percentage of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1 were lowest against 
Type B/Victoria and Type B/Yamagata compared to the Type A/H1N1 and Type A/H3N2. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1 against Type A/H1N1 and Type 
B/Victoria were comparable between Season 2 and 3. 
The percentage of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1 against Type A/H3N2 were higher for 
Season 2 compared to Season 3 (percentage of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1, Season 2: 
93.3% [QIVc], 91.5% [comparator] versus Season 3: 27.9% [QIVc], 26.9% [comparator]). 
The percentage of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1 against Type B/Yamagata were higher in 
Season 3 compared to Season 2 (percentage of subjects with HI titres ≥1:40 at Day 1, Season 2: 
18.6% [QIVc], 20.3% [comparator] versus Season 3: 44.8% [QIVc], 49.0% [comparator]). 
The percentages of subjects that achieved a HI antibody titre ≥ 1:40 at Day 22/50 were higher in 
Season 3 (94.8% [Type A/H1N1], 74.0% [A/H3N2], 68.8% [Type B/Victoria] and 79.2% 
[B/Yamagata]) compared with Season 2 (88.6% [Type A/H1N1], 90.0% [A/H3N2], 54.3% [Type 
B/Victoria] and 63.8% [B/Yamagata]). 
The results obtained for PPS Immunogenicity were consistent with results obtained in the FAS 
Immunogenicity. 
Seroconversion Rate 
Table 11 summarizes the seroconversion rate post-vaccination (21 days after last vaccination, e.g., Day 
22/50) in the FAS Immunogenicity. 
The seroconversion rate in the QIVc group was higher as compared to the comparator group post-
vaccination for all four strains. The LL of the 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion of subjects achieving an 
HI antibody seroconversion exceeded 30%, except for Type A/H3N2 in Season 2 (13.97%). The technical 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

challenges with HI assay used to assess immunogenicity against A/Singapore/GP2050/2015 (H3N2) may 
have contributed to the reduced rates of seroconversion in Season 2 compared with the other strains (see 
explanation below). 
Similar results were observed for subjects in the PPS Immunogenicity.  
Type A/H3N2 responses 
Differences in the immunological response measured by HI against Type A/H3N2 in Season 2 compared 
to Season 3 were noted, with nearly 4-fold higher baseline titre against Type A/H3N2 observed. In recent 
years, genetic changes in the HA of circulating and vaccine virus strains of A/H3N2 have resulted in the 
loss of capacity to agglutinate chicken or turkey erythrocytes (van Baalen et al. 2014). This was the case 
for the A/H3N2 strain used in the vaccine in Season 2 (A/Singapore/GP2050/2015) and thus the HI assay 
might not have reliably measured the immunogenicity against this virus strain. The HI assay in Season 2 
used guinea pig red blood cells without oseltamivir. Under these testing conditions, hemagglutination was 
predominantly due to neuraminidase (NA) and therefore the assay has measured mostly anti-NA 
antibodies (Mogling et al. 2017). Therefore, the HI results observed in Season 2 for the A/H3N2 strains 
should be considered less reliable. In addition, the use of erythrocytes from different species in Seasons 2 
and 3 might also explain the differences in baseline titres across these seasons (Makkoch et al. 2012, 
Trombetta et al. 2018). 
In Season 3 the A/North Carolina 04/2016 (H3N2) vaccine strain regained the capacity for 
hemagglutination through HA and the testing was done using turkey RBCs, not guinea pig. The 
interpretation of the data should therefore be consistent with the standard HI assay (Ovsyannikova et al. 
2014). Unfortunately, the A/North Carolina 04/2016 (H3N2) virus had an unusually low hemagglutination 
titre which appears to have reduced the sensitivity of the assay (more virus particles to make 1 
hemagglutination unit) and may explain the low HI GMT postvaccination. 
In light of the technical challenges with the HI assay, quantification of neutralizing antibody titres using 
the MN assay against Type A/H3N2 has been used as an alternative. The MN assay was used to measure 
immunogenicity in this study as an exploratory endpoint and the results were presented.

Notes 
The analysis shows that QIVc prevented RT-PCR- or culture confirmed influenza 
caused by any Type A or B strain in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age (primary 
efficacy endpoint) and 3 to < 18 years of age (co-primary endpoint). The VE of 
QIVc in children 2 to < 18 years of age was 54.6% (95% CI: 45.7 to 62.1). The 
success criterion was met as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI was above 20%. The 
VE of QIVc in children 3 to < 18 years of age was 54.03% (95% CI: 44.8 to 
61.7). The success criterion was met as the LL of 95% CI for VE is above 30%. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In general, the design of the phase III/IV study conducted to evaluate clinical efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity of the QIVc in children 2 to < 18 years of age (V130_12 clinical study) is considered 
adequate.  
The study was carried out as observer blind. Although the optimal design would have been a double 
blinded trial, it is considered that the observer blind strategy used here is sufficient because we consider 
very unlikely that this design would have affected the study outcomes. Subjects were randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to QIVc or non-influenza comparator vaccine, Menveo, a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, 
W-135, Y conjugate vaccine. The randomization was stratified by age (2 to < 9 years and 9 to < 18 
years). Subjects between 2 to < 9 years of age were further stratified by previous influenza vaccine 
status. Study subjects were scheduled to receive either a single dose of 0.5 mL of the study vaccine or a 
two-dose study vaccination regimen separated by approximately 4 weeks as clinically indicated depending 
on age and previous influenza vaccination history. This scheme is in accordance with paediatric influenza 
vaccine dosing recommendations and consistent with international recommendations. 
Regarding the blinding, a double blinding it is the preferred strategy, but observer blind can be 
considered acceptable with no overestimation treatment effects expected. 
The statistical methods are considered adequate. 
The total number of participants in this study, as well as the stratification by age is considered appropriate 
to demonstrate that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the VE is greater than 20% for the primary 
endpoint  assessment,  with  approximately  90%  power.  The  Inclusion/Exclusion  criteria  are  considered 
satisfactory.  Moreover, the strains composition of the vaccine met the WHO and CHMP recommendations 
for the seasons in which the CT were performed . Therefore, this is considered adequate too. 
The baseline characteristics of the enrolled subjects were well balanced between treatment groups, and 
there were a small percentage of subjects withdrawn from the study. The percentages and reason for 
discontinuation were similar in the two treatment groups, and there was no indication of selective 
discontinuation. Although in the overall population of this trial, the races and ethnic origins were all well 
balanced and represented, in the group of the 2 to < 9 years only white children and mostly Not Hispanic 
or Latino were recruited. On the other hand, there are only 100 subjects in the group 2 to 3 years (49 
received QIVc and 51 the comparator vaccine), and this is considered a bit scarce.    
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 44/67 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The definition and use of the PPS (Per Protocol Population Immunogenicity Set) population for 
immunogenicity comparisons is also considered adequate.  
As commented, there were some issues regarding to the loss of capacity of the A/H3N2 influenza virus 
strains to agglutinate chicken or turkey erythrocytes. To solve this situation, the MAH has used the MN 
assay (an exploratory objective) to measure the serologic response against the A/H3N2 strain contained 
in QIVc in Seasons 2 and 3, and this approach is found to be satisfactory.  
All objectives are considered acceptable. Particularly, it is important to note that the primary endpoint is 
aimed at demonstrating clinical efficacy in terms of disease prevention. Moreover, it is noted that there 
are two co-primary endpoints, the first one is that the efficacy of the QIVc would be demonstrated if the 
lower limit (LL) of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for VE is 20%, and for meeting the second 
one the LL of the 95% CI for vaccine Efficacy (VE) is above 30%. These two figures are sensible.   
The efficacy endpoint definitions followed the EU guidance, so they are considered adequate. An ILI case 
was defined as body temperature of ≥100.0°F/ ≥37.8°C (i.e., fever) along with any of the following 
symptoms: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhoea. This ILI definition goes along with the 
guideline on Influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) recommendations and take into account 
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) definitions for ILI.  The Influenza case 
definition was also properly defined following also de EU recommendations.  
An estimation of efficacy against influenza due to strains that are well-matched or unmatched (RT-PCR or 
culture confirmed) to those in the vaccine was also analysed. This is considered important to show the 
overall potential benefit of the vaccine. 
The following comment is made in relation to the overall design of the trial. The guideline on Influenza 
vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) specifically requires a demonstration of vaccine efficacy in the 
6-36 month group, for an indication that includes children of this age. For children older than 36 months, 
the Guideline states: “For an indication for use in children aged from 3 years up to approximately 9 years, 
in whom the proportion that is primed is likely to be very variable in different settings, authorisation 
should usually be based on demonstrating that the immune responses to the selected dose and regimen 
are at least as good as those observed in children aged 6-36 months in whom efficacy has been 
satisfactorily demonstrated.” For this age group (3 to 9 YOA) it also states: “In cases where vaccine 
efficacy could not be demonstrated in the 6-36 month-olds, the possible basis for an authorisation for use 
in 3-9 year-olds should be discussed with competent regulatory authorities.” In line with this 
recommendation, the MAH discussed the design of V130_12 study in a follow-up scientific advice in 2016 
(EMEA/H/SA/2628/2/FU/1/2016/PED/II) and the CHMP agreed that this study was carried out to 
demonstrate clinical efficacy in children older than 3 years of age. Originally study V130_12 was designed 
to be performed in children 4 to 18 YOA, but in a protocol amendment the lower age was changed to 2 
YOA. Therefore, the MAH has submitted clinical efficacy data in the whole 2 to <18 age group, which is 
acknowledged and welcomed, and in accordance with CHMP scientific advice.  
As discussed below the results for the 2 to 18 years group clearly support the indication for this age 
group.  
No other measurements now cited in EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014 (for example, single radial 
haemolysis, cell-mediated immunity, antigen-specific T-cell frequencies, CD4+ and CD8+ responses, 
activation of memory B cells, or evaluation of anti-neuraminidase antibodies) were assessed in the 
V130_12 protocol. This cell-mediated immunity will be measured in the ongoing study V130_10, which is 
a phase III, non-inferior immunogenicity and safety versus licensed QIV comparator in children 6 months 
to < 4 years of age. 
Based on all these considerations, the design of the clinical trial is considered appropriate.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary and co-primary efficacy endpoints, absolute VE (aVE) relative to comparator against any 
influenza Type A or B strain were achieved.  The analysis showed that QIVc prevented RT-PCR- or culture 
confirmed influenza caused by any Type A or B strain in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age (primary efficacy 
endpoint) and 3 to < 18 years of age (co-primary endpoint). The VE of QIVc in children 2 to < 18 years of 
age was 54.6% (95% CI: 45.7 to 62.1). Success criteria were met as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI was 
above 20%. The VE of QIVc in children 3 to < 18 years of age was 54.0% (95% CI: 44.8 to 61.7). The 
success criterion was met as the LL of 2-sided 95% CI for VE is above 30%.  
Moreover, the secondary efficacy objectives, that were efficacy against RT-PCR or culture-confirmed 
influenza in the overall study population 2 to < 18 years of age either due to any influenza type A or B 
strain or due to influenza type A or B antigenically matched strains were also met. The VE numbers were 
54.63% (95% CI [45.67, 62.12]) for PCR-confirmed regardless of antigenic match, 60.81% (95% CI 
[51.30, 68.46]) for cultured-confirmed regardless of antigenic match, and 63.64% (95% CI [53.64; 
71.48]) for culture-confirmed and matched to the strains contained in the vaccine.  
Moreover, aVE analyses was also performed in different subgroups: by age, by vaccination status, by 
race, by sex, by country or region, and by season/year treated. As discussed below, none of these 
analyses questioned the superior aVE of the vaccine vs the comparator.  
As it can be seen in the following summary table, the aVE (RT-PCR or Culture confirmed, any strain) was 
also analysed in two other age cohorts (different from the 2 to < 18 or 3 to < 18 for the primary and 
coprimary efficacy endpoints). The aVE observed were similar between in the two cases.  
The aVE for matched strain was again, similar between all the subgroups, although in the 2 to < 4 group 
the aVE was a bit higher.  Interestingly, the unmatched aVE seems to be similar between all the 
subgroups but the 2 to 4 years old group.  This could mean that this vaccine cannot provide cross 
protection against non-matching circulating strains to this age strata, although this cannot be concluded  
due to the low number of subjects in this age strata.

Regarding to the vaccination status, in subjects 2 to <18 years of age, the VE of QIVc compared with 
comparator vaccine for any RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed strain tended to be higher in subjects 
“previously vaccinated” against influenza 58.67 (47.45, 67.50) as compared to “not previously 
vaccinated” subjects 48.39 (32.13; 60.75]. Overall, there were 314 RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed (178 
Type A and 136 Type B) cases in “previously vaccinated” compared to 225 (132 Type A and 95 Type B) in 
“not previously vaccinated” subjects. As it can be seen in the following table, there was no difference 
between “previously vaccinated” and “not previously vaccinated” subjects in strain specific VE.

The analysis showed that VE was similar for White subjects 54.74 (41.54, 64.96) and for Asian subjects 
53.70 (40.24,64.13). There were too few subjects amongst the other racial groups to estimate vaccine 
efficacy.  As expected, the VE was also similar for male subjects 54.70 (42.04,64.59) and female subjects 
54.47 (40.64,65.08).  
Finally, the analysis showed that VE varied across countries and was highest in Australia (VE: 93.70% 
[95% CI: 52.28; 99.17]). In 5 out of the 7 countries, for which the assessment could be made, QIVc 
showed a statistically significant decrease in RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza in subjects 2 to <18 
years of age, in 2 countries the VE was not statistically significant, Thailand (VE: 23.85% [95% CI: -
53.10; 62.13]) and Finland (VE: 38.30% [95% CI: -2.78; 62.96]). Overall, for every country the VE 
against Type A was higher than against Type B. The VE against Type A was driven by the VE against Type 
A/H1N1 strains.  
The MAH explained that despite the relatively small number of study participants aged 2 to <3 years (100 
subjects: 49 in the QIVc group and 51 in the comparator group), the incidence of any RT-PCR- or culture-
confirmed influenza, reported during the study period, was high: 13/51 subjects (25.5%) in the 
comparator group, and 4/49 subjects (8.2%) in the QIVc group (see table 15). The MAH also highlighted 
that the estimate of vaccine efficacy in children in the 2 to <3 years of age group was 67.97 (95% CI: 
8.00, 88.79) and was consistent with efficacy estimates in other age groups, and in the overall study 
population.  In addition, the MAH mentioned that the efficacy of QIVc in “previously vaccinated” and “not 
previously vaccinated” children was comparable and that there was no difference in strain-specific efficacy 
against the different influenza strains between these two groups of influenza vaccinated subjects. This 
point is considered important, since the youngest children are mostly influenza-naïve and it is a potential 
concern that they do not respond to influenza vaccines as well as older children.

Table 16: Number of subjects with first-occurrence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and 
absolute vaccine efficacy (95% CI) by any strain and age – Full Analysis set efficacy. 
All the data and analysis are considered adequate.  
Immunogenicity data  
The secondary immunogenicity objective was to characterize the immunogenicity of QIVc by 
hemagglutination inhibition (HI assay) 3 weeks after the last vaccination in a subset of 751 subjects 2 to 
<9 years of age, who were enrolled in Season 2 (n=432) and Season 3 (n=319). From those, 721 
(n=422 [Season 2]; n=299 [Season 3]) were included in the FAS Immunogenicity. 
Immunogenicity were assessed at baseline (Day 1; all subjects in immunogenicity subset), at Day 22 (all 
“previously vaccinated” subjects receiving a single dose of the study vaccine), and at Days 29 and 50 (all 
“not previously vaccinated” subjects receiving 2 doses) for all 4 influenza strains using the HI assay. 
The immunogenicity objectives were evaluated using the immunogenicity subset of subjects. The analysis 
was based on the FAS Immunogenicity. The Immunogenicity data was analysed descriptively and no 
success criteria were applied. 
As already commented above, the HI results were inconsistent in Season 2 for the A/H3N2 strain. To 
solve this situation, the MAH has used the MN assay (an exploratory objective) to measure the serologic 
response against the A/H3N2 strain contained in QIVc.  This solution is agreeable. 
The data from trial V130_12 showed that children from 2 to <9 years (seronegative at baseline) had 
developed in general an immune response after vaccination with QIVc against all strains.  Although, post-
vaccination GMTs were lowest against the B strains, but higher for B-Yamagata compared with B-Victoria. 
Similar results were observed for subjects seropositive (HI titres ≥1:10) at baseline. Specifically, baseline 
QIVc GMTs assessed by either HI or MN were higher in subjects whose parents/LAR reported prior 
vaccination and QIVc GMRs were higher in subjects who were not previously vaccinated.  Also, post-
vaccination GMTs were lowest against the B strains, but higher for B-Yamagata compared with B-Victoria. 
Overall, this is the situation observed with influenza vaccines. Thus, it can be considered that the vaccine 
induces an adequate immune response in children 2 to <9 years independently on the serostatus at 
baseline. 
The vaccine strain composition changed between seasons. Except for the Type A/H1N1 vaccine strain, all 
other vaccine strains (Type A/H3N2, Type B/Yamagata and Type B/Victoria) were updated for each 
season. Therefore, all the immunogenicity results were presented by season, even in the case where the 
strain did not change (e.g. A/H1N1).  The FAS Immunogenicity was predominantly White (99.0%), which 
is a markedly higher proportion than in the All Enrolled Set. The MAH explained that this was due to the 
geographical location of these subjects (Estonia, Finland, Poland, and Lithuania) limited by enrolment in 
Seasons 2 and 3. Four subjects were of Hispanic or Latino origin, all other subjects were of “Not Hispanic 
or Latino” origin. It would have been optimal to include participants from different ethnic groups, however 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 48/67 
 
 
  
  
 
having in mind all the scientific knowledge on the immune response to influenza vaccines in different 
races, it is not expected that this issue introduces any bias. 
In conclusion, there was a robust and substantial immune response across the 2 seasons in subjects who 
received QIVc; even with seasonal differences in vaccine strains and baseline GMTs. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
This addendum provides information on the clinical study completed for QIVc, Study V130_12 
(NCT03165617), a Phase 3/4 efficacy, immunogenicity and safety study in children 2 to < 18 years of 
age.  This study was a regulatory (post-marketing) requirement to confirm the clinical benefit of QIVc for 
use in children ≥4 years of age in the US consistent with regulations for accelerated approval (US Code of 
Federal Regulations 21 CFR 601.40-46). To fulfil additional registration requirements with the European 
Union (EU) children ≥2 years of age were also enrolled in this study to further evaluate QIVc in a broader 
age range.  
The V130_12 QIVc trial was appropriately designed and all the efficacy primary and co-primary endpoints 
were met.  Moreover, this trial is part of the PIP and has been discussed with the PDCO. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the initial MAA, the indication sought by the MAH was the prevention of influenza in children 4 years of 
age and older and adults. The data to support the adult indication (older than 18 YOA) were found to be 
sufficient by the CHMP. Nevertheless, the indication finally granted for children only covered the age 
between 9 and 18 years of age.  
With the current application, the MAH is submitting the data from the efficacy study V130_12, in support 
of an extension of the indication from 2 years of age and above. 
The predefined success criteria for the 2 co-primary efficacy objectives were met, demonstrating that 
QIVc was efficacious in preventing influenza in children 2 to < 18 years and children 3 to < 18 years of 
age. The observed VE in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age (primary endpoint) was 54.63%, and the lower 
bound of the 95% CI was greater than 20% (95% CI: 45.67; 62.12). The observed VE in subjects 3 to < 
18 years of age (co-primary endpoint) was 54.03%, and the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 
30%. All secondary endpoints were consistent with the primary study endpoint. 
Moreover, aVE analyses was also performed by stratifying according to the following subgroups: by age, 
by vaccination status, by race, by sex, by country or region, and by season/year treated. None of these 
analyses questioned the superior aVE of the vaccine vs the comparator. 
In regard to the assessments of immunogenicity, study V130_12 has generally followed the EU Guideline 
on Influenza Vaccines Non-clinical and Clinical Module (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) and the CBER 
Guidance for the Licensure of Seasonal Influenza Vaccines (CBER, 2007).  Also, the design of this study 
has been discussed with EMA through several scientific advices and the CHMP advice has been followed. 
As recommended, the assessment of vaccine efficacy used laboratory-confirmed influenza as the primary 
endpoint, and in a subset of subjects, immunogenicity was assessed via the haemagglutinin inhibition 
(HI) and microneuralization (MN) assays. Serology was assessed at baseline (i.e., before vaccination) and 
at 3 weeks after the last vaccination, which is approximately when the HI antibodies reach their peak in 
human sera (Kunzel et al., 1996).  In conclusion, there was a robust and substantial immune response 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 49/67 
 
 
  
  
across the 2 seasons in subjects who received QIVc; even with seasonal differences in vaccine strains and 
baseline GMTs. 
Regarding the demonstration of efficacy for each paediatric age group, the requirements of the Guideline 
on Influenza Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) are: 
• 
• 
The guideline specifically requires a demonstration of vaccine efficacy in the 6-36 month 
group, for an indication that includes children of this age.  
For an indication for use in children aged from 3 years up to approximately 9 years, in whom 
the proportion that is primed is likely to be very variable in different settings, authorisation 
should usually be based on demonstrating that the immune responses to the selected dose 
and regimen are at least as good as those observed in children aged 6-36 months in whom 
efficacy has been satisfactorily demonstrated. In cases where vaccine efficacy could not be 
demonstrated in the 6-36 month olds, the possible basis for an authorisation for use in 3-9 
year-olds should be discussed with competent regulatory authorities.  
• 
For an indication that includes use from approximately 9 years to < 18 years, a 
demonstration of vaccine efficacy is not required. Authorisation may be based on a direct 
comparison of immune responses to the candidate vaccine between subjects aged 9-<18 
years and young adults or directly against an authorised inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal 
influenza vaccine administered to the same age group. 
In the case of the V130_12 study, the MAH discussed the trial design with EU regulatory authorities 
through the scientific advice procedure, and the CHMP agreed with the MAH’s proposal to carry out an 
absolute efficacy study in children 3 years of age and older.  
As it is detailed in section on “Demographic and Baseline data”, 50.7% of the subjects were in the age 
strata 2 to<9 YOA, so the high aVE obtained in this age subgroup supports the requested indication for 
this age subgroup. Moreover, in the youngest age subgroup (2 to < 4 YOA) aVE  was 62.66 (95%CI : 
38.06 -,77.49). However, it was noted that the number of subjects included in this age strata were 332 
subjects, but that only 100 (49 received QIVc and 51 the comparator vaccine) of them were in the age 
strata 2 to <3 YOA. Considering that the CHMP guideline on Influenza vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) clearly states  that a demonstration of vaccine efficacy is required for an 
indication that includes use in children from 6 to 36 months, stratified 24 to <36 months of age data were 
requested. The MAH provided a justification regarding the results obtained in this very small group (49 
subjects 24-36 months of age) and highlighted why they are relevant to support an indication for this age 
strata. Despite the relatively small number of study participants aged 2 to <3 years, the incidence of any 
RT-PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza, reported during the study period, was high: 13/51 subjects 
(25.5%) in the comparator group, and 4/49 subjects (8.2%) in the QIVc group. The MAH also 
emphasized that the estimate of vaccine efficacy in children in the 2 to <3 years of age group was 67.97 
(95% CI: 8.00, 88.79) and was consistent with efficacy estimates in other age groups, and in the overall 
study population.  In addition, the MAH mentioned that the efficacy of QIVc in “previously vaccinated” 
and “not previously vaccinated” children was comparable and that there was no difference in strain-
specific efficacy against the different influenza strains between these two groups of influenza vaccinated 
subjects. This point is considered important, since the youngest children are mostly influenza-naïve and it 
is a potential concern that they do not respond to influenza vaccines as well as older children.  In 
conclusion, it is agreed with the Company that the study results indicate a consistent performance of 
QIVc vaccine in children 2 through 18 years of age, including subjects 2 to <3 years of age. 
In conclusion, the data provided by the MAH support the indication for prophylaxis of influenza in subjects 
of 2 years of age and older.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current indication for Flucelvax Tetra is established for children aged 9 years and older, adolescents 
and adults. The safety profile of Flucelvax Tetra was based on the data from 2 clinical studies comparing 
QIVc to TIVc. Both studies (study V130_01 and study V130_03) were phase 3 trials conducted in the US, 
in adults 18 years of age and above (including elderly adults), and in subjects 4 to < 18 years of age, 
respectively. Therefore, the QIVc database accounted was of 1324 subjects ≥ 18 years of age and 1159 
subjects 4 to <18 years. Additionally this database was supported by the safety data set coming from the 
TIVc studies. 
The most common adverse reactions reported in adults ≥18 years of age were injection site pain, 
headache, fatigue, followed by erythema and myalgia. In the paediatric population, the most common 
adverse reactions reported were pain, tenderness and erythema followed by headache, fatigue and 
myalgia. The majority of solicited reactions were mild to moderate in severity in all age groups studied.  
To support this application, the description of the safety of Flucelvax tetra compared to a non-influenza 
comparator (Menveo) in children of 2 to <18 years of age is analysed in the clinical study V130_12. 
Patient exposure 
The safety dataset for children comprises data derived from 4514 subjects 2 to <18 years of age enrolled 
in V130_12 study. From these, 2258 subjects received QIVc. Approximately half of them (57.07%) were 
children between 2 to <9 years of age.  
In the proportion of subjects 2 to <9 years of age, 32.8% of them had previously received one dose of 
influenza vaccine followed by one dose of the study vaccine.  The rest of them, 763 subjects, had not 
been previously vaccinated against influenza vaccine and received two doses of the study vaccine 
separated by approximately 28 days.  
All of the subjects 9 to <18 years of age (100%) were categorized as previously vaccinated against 
influenza and received 1 dose of the study vaccine or the comparator.  
There was no notable difference in the distribution of demographic and baseline characteristics (age, sex, 
ethnic origin or country of enrolment) between the 2 vaccine groups. 
Adverse events 
Solicited Adverse Events 
Solicited local and systemic AEs in subjects 2 to <18 years of age were recorded at 30 minutes following 
vaccination and from 6 hours through Day 7 after vaccination. The use of analgesics/antipyretic for 
prophylaxis or treatment of fever (define as body temperature ≥38ºC, preferably measured orally) was 
evaluated. 
The rates of solicited AEs reported within 30 minutes after any vaccination were low in subjects 2 to <18 
years of age, being reported as slightly higher in the QIVc group (9.5%) compared to the comparator 
group (7.3%).  
The percentage of subjects with any solicited AE reported from Day 1 through Day 7 after vaccination was 
51.4% in the QIVc and 48.6% in the comparator group. The rates of local and systemic solicited AEs were 
similar in each vaccine group (see table below).

Solicited Local Adverse Events 
The percentage of subjects with any solicited local AE reported from Day 1 (6 hours) through Day 7 after 
vaccination was 36.8% in the QIVc group and 33.6% in the comparator group (see table 16). No notable 
differences in the rate of solicited local AEs were observed between the QIVc and the comparator, except 
for a slightly higher rate of pain in the QIVc (23.8% in QIV group vs 19.0% in comparator group), but a 
slightly lower rate of induration and erythema observed in the QIVc group vs the comparator. The most 
commonly reported solicited local AEs were tenderness, pain and erythema; the majority were mild to 
moderate in severity (the proportion of subjects with severe local AEs in OIVc groups was ≤1%). See 
table 17.

Solicited Systemic Adverse Events  
The percentage of subjects 2 to <18 years of age with any solicited systemic AE reported from Day 1 
(6 hours) through Day 7 after vaccination was 31.4% in the QIVc group and 30.5% in the comparator 
group. No notable differences in the rate of solicited systemic AEs were observed between the QIVc and 
the comparator. The most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs were headache, feeling fatigue or 
tiredness; the majority were mild to moderate in severity (the proportion of subjects with severe 
systemic AEs in QIVc groups was ≤1%).  
The proportion of subjects reporting solicited systemic AEs after any vaccination was lower in the 
previously vaccinated subjects, compared to the group that had received two doses of QIVc. Additionally, 
in this group, the solicited systemic AEs were reported as slightly lower after the second dose than after 
the first dose of QIVc.

Fever (≥38ºC) was reported by 5.3% and 4.5% in QIVc and comparator group, respectively. The 
proportion of subjects using analgesics/antipyretics after any vaccination for prevention or treatment of 
pain/fever was similar for the QIVc (6.0% and 6.2%, respectively) and for the comparator groups (5.0% 
and 4.8% respectively). 
Unsolicited Adverse Events  
Unsolicited Adverse Events were reported spontaneously through Day 22 or 50 depending on whether 
they received 1 or 2 vaccinations.  
The rates of unsolicited AEs in subjects 2 to <18 years of age during the treatment period was similar in 
the QIVc group and the comparator group. Only 4.3% and 3.9 % were considered to be at least possibly 
related to the study vaccine and comparator vaccine by the investigator..

illness (1.1%). Other unsolicited AEs considered as related to the study vaccine were reported as less 
than 0.7% (Upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis, rhinorrhoea, cough and nasopharyngitis)  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs, deaths and other significant events (new onset of chronic disease, events leading to withdrawal and 
medically-attended AEs within 30 days after the onset) were collected for up 6 months after the last 
vaccination. 
In total, 25 (1.1%) subjects in the QIVc group and 30 (1.3%) subjects in the comparator group reported 
SAEs after any vaccination with onset from Day 1 through end of study. No SAEs were assessed as 
related to vaccination. 
One death occurred in a subject who had received the comparator vaccine. 
No AEs leading to withdrawal from the study were reported.  
The proportion of subjects who reported medically-attended unsolicited AEs and reported AE leading to 
NOCD was similar for both vaccine groups. None of the AEs leading to new onset of chronic disease was 
considered to be related to the study vaccine. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
By Age 
In the analysis by age subgroups, solicited AEs data were analysed stratified in subjects 2 to < 6, 6 to < 
9, and 9 to < 18 years of age. Unsolicited AEs were analysed by age groups of 2 to < 9 and 9 to < 18 
years of age. 
Solicited AEs: 
In the analysis by age subgroups, the proportion of subjects with any solicited local AEs within 30 
minutes after any vaccination were low for the QIVc (0.4%-1.4%) and the comparator group (0.7% - 
1.4%) in all age subgroups. The most commonly reported local solicited AEs after 7 day following  any 
vaccination for both vaccine groups were tenderness (in the 2 to <6 years aged group), pain (in the 6 to 
<9 years aged group and in 9 to <18 years aged group) and erythema in all age groups. Additionally, the 
older children (9 to <18 years of age) reported overall a slightly lower percentage of solicited AEs 
compared to the younger children (including pain).  
In both vaccine groups, the proportion of subjects (in 2 to <6, and in 6 to <9 years of age group) who 
had not been previously vaccinated with influenza vaccine reported lower solicited local AEs after the 
second vaccination than after the first vaccination with QIVc.  
Regarding the solicited systemic AEs, the proportion of subjects with any solicited systemic AEs within 30 
minutes after any vaccination were low. No notable differences for the QIVc and the comparator group 
were observed in all age subgroups. The most commonly reported systemic solicited AEs 7 days after any 
vaccination were sleepiness and irritability in the 2 to <6 age group; in the other age groups the most 
commonly reported systemic solicited AEs were headache and feeling fatigue or tiredness. In all age 
group, the incidence of these solicited AES were <1% in the QIVc and the comparator group.  
Additionally, the older children (9 to <18 age group) reported slightly lower rates of fever (≥38ºC) 
compared to the younger children (2.8%, 6.4% and 8.8% in 9 to <18 , 6 to <9 and 2 to <6  age group, 
respectively).

Additionally, the older children (9 to <18 years of age) reported overall a slightly lower percentage of 
solicited AEs compared to the younger children. 
The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 6 to less 
than 9 years of age were pain at the injection site (61%), injection site erythema (25%), injection site 
induration (19%), fatigue (16%), headache (16%) and injection site ecchymosis (11%).  
The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions after any vaccination in children 2 to less 
than 6 years of age were tenderness at the injection site (54%), injection site erythema (23%), 
sleepiness (21%), irritability (19%), injection site induration (15%), change in eating habits (14%) and 
injection site ecchymosis (11%). 
Unsolicited AEs: 
The proportion of subjects with any unsolicited AEs and any possibly related unsolicited AEs was lower in 
older subjects (18.1% and 2.6%) compared to the younger subjects (37.7% and 5.9%) in the QIVc 
group.   
By gender 
No notable differences in frequency of subjects 2 to <18 years of age reporting any local or systemic 
solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs were found between genders.  
By racial/ethnic origin 
The proportion of subjects 2 to <18 years of age reporting any solicited local and systemic AEs was 
higher in White subjects than in Asian subjects in both vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects with 
unsolicited AEs was similar in Asian and White subjects.  The numbers of subjects from other racial origin 
were too small to make a meaningful comparison.  
Extrinsic Factor 
By vaccination status 
In subgroup 2 to 6 years of age and 6 to 9 years of age the vaccine scheme was defined for influenza 
vaccination status. The previously vaccinated subjects received 1 dose and the non-previously vaccinated 
received 2 doses of QIVc.  
All of the subject 9 to <18 years of age (100%) were categorized as previously vaccinated against 
influenza and received 1 dose of the study vaccine or the comparator. With respect to solicited local and 
systemic  AEs, the proportion of subjects with solicited AEs after any vaccination was lower in the  
“previously vaccinated” group than in the “not previously vaccinated” group. In both vaccine groups, the 
proportion of “ not previously vaccinated” with any solicited AEs was lower after the second vaccination 
than after the first vaccination.  
Regarding the Unsolicited AEs, a lower proportion of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs was found in the 
“previously vaccinated” subjects than in the “not previously vaccinated” group. 
Post marketing experience 
QIVc was approved in the US for prevention of influenza in persons 4 years of age and older on 23 May 
2016.  Safety data in adults and children from 9 years of age onwards have been provided in UE since its 
approval on 12th December 2018. The same vaccine was approved in Canada on 22 November 2019 for 
subjects 9 years of age and older, and in Brazil for people aged 18 years and older since February 2020.

Additional adverse events were reported from postmarketing surveillance, as summarized in the most 
recent QIVc Periodic Safety Update Report. Post marketing experience with QIVC has not identified any 
safety concern. There was no change to the safety information during the report in the period and the 
cumulative experience reminded in accordance with the RMP. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The current indication for Flucelvax Tetra is established for children aged 9 years and older, adolescents 
and adults. This indication was based on the data provided by 2 clinical studies comparing QIVc to TIVc: 
Study V130_01 in subjects 2 to <18 years of age, and study V130_03, in subjects 4 to < 18 years of age.  
An additional clinical study Phase 3/4 (V130_12) has been provided to support the authorisation of 
Seqirus’ cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVc) for the prevention of influenza in adults and 
children from 2 years of age onwards. In V130_12, Flucelvax tetra was compared to a non-influenza 
comparator (Menveo) in children of 2 to <18 years of age. Co-administration of other vaccines was not 
investigated in this study. 
The safety database in V130_12 was of 4514 subjects 2 to <18 years of age. From these, 2258 subjects 
received QIVc. Approximately half of them (57.07%) were children between 2 to <9 years of age. In 2 to 
>9 years of age, 67.2% (763 subjects) had not been previously vaccinated against any influenza vaccine 
and received two doses of the study vaccine separated by approximately 28 days. The rest of children 2 
to >9 and all 9 to >18 years of age received one dose of the study vaccine.  
The rates of reported solicited local and systemic AEs during the treatment period (recorded at 30 
minutes following vaccination and from 6 hours through Day 7 after vaccination) were comparable 
between the 2 vaccine groups in subjects 2 to <18 years of age.  
The rates of solicited AEs reported within 30 minutes after any vaccination were reported as low but  
slightly higher in the QIVc group (9.5%) compared to the comparator group (7.3%). The percentage of 
subjects with any solicited AE reported from Day 1 through Day 7 after vaccination was 51.4% in the 
QIVc and 48.6% in the comparator group. Regarding the solicited local AEs, similar rates were observed 
in each vaccine group (36.9% in the QIVc group and 33.6% in the comparator group), as  no notable 
differences were observed between the QIVc and the comparator. Nevertheless a slightly higher rate of 
pain, but a slightly lower rate of induration and erythema was reported in the QIVc group vs the 
comparator. The most commonly reported solicited local AEs were erythema, pain and tenderness; the 
majority were mild to moderate in severity. 
Regarding the solicited systemic AEs, similar rates were reported in each vaccine group (31.4% in the 
QIVc group and 30.5% in the comparator group) as no notable differences were observed between the 
QIVc and the comparator. Nevertheless, a slightly higher rate of headache, but a slightly lower rate of 
feeling fatigue or tiredness was reported in the QIVc vs the comparator group. The most commonly 
reported solicited systemic AEs were headache, feeling fatigue or tiredness and the majority were mild to 
moderate in severity. Fever (≥38ºC) was reported by 5.3% and 4.5% in QIVc and comparator group, 
respectively. 
The rates of unsolicited AEs were comparable between the 2 vaccine groups in the subjects of 2 to <18 
years of age. Only 4.3% and 3.9 % were considered to be at least possibly related to the study vaccine 
and to the comparator vaccine by the investigator. 
In the subgroup analysis by age, the proportion of subjects with any solicited local and systemic AEs 
within the 30 minutes after any vaccination were low and comparable in both vaccine groups in all age 
subgroups. Additionally, the older children (9 to <18 years of age) reported overall slightly lower

percentage of solicited local and systemic AEs within the 30 minutes after vaccination compared to the 
younger children. 
The solicited AEs (local and systemic) rates from 6 hours through Day 7 after any vaccination, stratified 
by the different age subgroups (2 to <6, 6 to <9 and 9 to <18), to establish comparisons in terms of 
reactogenicity between the study vaccine and the comparator in the different age groups were 
provided. Overall, no notable differences in the rate of solicited local and systemic AEs were observed 
between the QIVc and the comparator in any age subgroup. Only, a slightly higher rate of tenderness in 
the QIVc in 2 to <6 yoa subjects and a slightly higher rate of pain, chills, headache and body temperature 
≥38.0ᵒC in the QIVc group in 6 to <9 yoa group was reported. The majority of the reported solicited local 
and systemic AEs in any age group were mild to moderate in severity. Additionally, the older children (9 
to <18 years of age) reported overall a slightly lower percentage of solicited AEs compared to the 
younger children.  
Comparing the rates reported by any solicited AEs in the new  V130_12 study in subjects 2 to < 18 years 
of age to the study V130_03 performed in 4 to <18 years of age group, the data observed in the QIVc 
group were lower in the new study (51.4% and 72% respectively). This difference was mainly observed in 
the solicited local AEs, whereas the rates were much lower in the new V130_12 than in the reported 
before (36.9% and 66% in V130_12 and V130_03 respectively). No notable difference in the rates 
regarding solicited systemic AEs was found between these studies (31.4% and 38% in V130_ 12 and 
V130_03 respectively). These differences in the rates observed were associated to ethnicity. This effect 
was observed in both QIVc and comparator groups in the study V130_12. 
The proportion of subjects with any unsolicited AEs and any possibly related unsolicited AEs was lower in 
the older subjects (18.1% and 2.6%) compared to the younger subjects (37.7% and 5.9%) in the QIVc 
group. By gender, no notable differences in the frequency of solicited or unsolicited AEs were observed. 
By racial/ethnic origin, only a comparison between Asian and white population was made, as the numbers 
of subjects from other racial origin were too small to make a meaningful comparison. The proportion of 
subjects 2 to <18 years with any solicited local and systemic AEs were higher in White subjects than in 
Asian subjects in both vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects with unsolicited AEs was similar in Asian 
and White subjects.  
When considering the vaccination status, the proportion of subjects with any solicited and unsolicited AEs 
after any vaccination was lower in the “previously vaccinated” group than in the “not previously 
vaccinated” group, in both subgroups 2 to 6 years of age and 6 to 9 years of age. The proportion of 
subjects with any solicited AEs was lower after the second vaccination in the “not previously vaccinated” 
group than after the first vaccination in both vaccine groups.  
No SAEs (1.1% and 1.3% in QIVc and comparator group, respectively) and deaths (one in comparator 
group) reported were assessed as related to the vaccination with the study vaccine. No AEs leading to 
withdrawal from the study were reported after the vaccination with QIVc. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
After assessing the submitted safety data collected in the new phase III study V130_12, the QIVc safety 
profile is in general comparable to that of the non-influenza comparator vaccine. No new safety signal has 
been observed in the submitted clinical database. It can be concluded that QIVc vaccine in subjects 2 to 
<9 years of age does not have any clinically relevant safety issue.  
Therefore, the safety profile of QIV is considered to be adequate to support the indication for prophylaxis 
of influenza in subjects of 2 years of age and older.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Immunogenicity information, GMT and seroconversation rates, for study V130_03 has been updated in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include the patients from 4YoA who were excluded, as these were not 
originally covered in the indication. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.

2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Flucelvax Tetra (Influenza vaccine (surface 
antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell cultures)) was included in the additional monitoring list as it is a 
biological product that is authorised after 1 January 2011 at the moment of its MAA.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza A and B viruses are important human respiratory pathogens which are transmitted mainly by 
droplets and aerosols originating from the respiratory secretions of infected people, but occasionally also 
through contact with virus contaminated fomites. Both A and B viruses cause seasonal influenza 
epidemics and out of season sporadic cases and outbreaks. Influenza occurs globally with an annual 
attack rate estimated at 5%– 10% in adults and 20%–30% in children. More severe illness is more 
common in the elderly, the very young and those with other chronic medical conditions. 
Although human influenza A viruses are perceived to carry greater risk because they account for the 
majority of influenza cases in most seasons, influenza B viruses also impose a substantial public health 
burden, particularly among children and at-risk subjects. Specifically, the type B influenza virus causes 
20% to 25% of influenza infections worldwide. In addition, since the 2001-2002 influenza season, both 
influenza B lineages, B/Victoria-like viruses and B/Yamagata-like viruses, have co-circulated in Europe. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies  
The most effective single public health intervention to mitigate and prevent seasonal influenza is 
vaccination. Available antiviral treatments are limited and have limited efficacy, in addition to generating 
a high rate of drug-resistant viruses. Only symptomatic treatment is otherwise available. 
Annual prophylactic vaccination is the most effective way to prevent disease and severe outcomes. 
Influenza vaccines are designed to protect against illness from the circulating virus strains, and the most 
commonly used vaccines have been inactivated influenza vaccines.  
For many years, seasonal influenza vaccines included antigens from 3 influenza strains in their 
composition, 2 influenza A strains (largely A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and a strain from 1 of the 2 influenza B 
lineages (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria). However, TIVs have been associated with potential for vaccine 
mismatch depending on whether B/Yamagata or B/Victoria is chosen for inclusion in the seasonal vaccine. 
Indeed, the predicted B strain included in the recommended northern hemisphere seasonal influenza 
vaccine was incorrect during 5 of 10 influenza seasons from 2001/2002 to 2010/2011. In order to avoid 
vaccine mismatch, quadrivalent influenza vaccines that include influenza B strains from both lineages 
have been recommended and these are expected to provide protection against the additional B strain.  
Flucelvax Tetra is intended for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and children from 9 years of age and 
should be used in accordance with official recommendations. Flucelvax Tetra is a quadrivalent inactivated 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 62/67 
 
 
  
  
influenza vaccine including B strains of both lineages and is therefore expected to improve protection in 
target populations, especially in children where significant disease due to influenza B strains occurs and 
the potential for vaccine B strain mismatch has existed with trivalent influenza virus vaccines. Other 
quadrivalent influenza vaccines are authorised for use in adults and children both at the national and at 
the centralised level in Europe; as such there is not an unmet medical need. However, it is important to 
have different options available on the market. In addition, this vaccine is prepared in cell culture 
differently to others, which may constitute an alternative for people allergic to eggs. A need exists in 
younger children (i.e. <4YOA), such as those not already naturally primed by influenza virus. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
At the time of marketing authorisation, the clinical development program of QIVc included two-phase III 
stratified, randomized, double-blind, multicentre studies that were conducted to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy (immunogenicity) of the QIVc in children and adolescents (4 to < 18 years of age, V130_03 
clinical study) and in adults (18 to > 75 years of age, V130_01 clinical study). In these studies, 2 
different comparator vaccines were used: TIV1c (cell-based, trivalent influenza virus that included the B 
strain from the B/Yamagata lineage) and TIV2c (cell-based, trivalent influenza virus vaccine that included 
the B strain from the B/Victoria lineage). 
In addition to these studies, supportive data from 16 phase I to III studies have been performed with 
TIVc (Optaflu was authorised in Europe via the centralised procedure in 2007), including 12 randomized 
controlled studies against an egg-based licensed comparator and an absolute efficacy study in adults 18 
to < 50 years (V58P13).  
In addition, the MAH included immunogenicity and safety data generated with TIVc vaccine in children 4 
to < 18 years in study VP58P12. 
The scope of this variation is to extend the indication to 2 years of age and above. For that aim, the MAH 
presents the results from study V130_12, a phase 3/4 efficacy, immunogenicity and safety study in 
children 2 to < 18 years of age. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In general, the design of the phase III/IV study conducted to evaluate efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity of the QIVc in children 2 to < 18 years of age (V130_12 clinical study) is considered 
adequate. 
The primary objective of V130_12 to demonstrate the absolute vaccine efficacy of QIVc versus a non-
influenza comparator determined by first occurrence RT-PCR or culture confirmed influenza, due to any 
influenza Type A and B strain in subjects who were 2 years to < 18 years of age was met.   
The primary and co-primary efficacy endpoints, absolute vaccine efficacy (aVE) relative to comparator 
against any influenza Type A or B strain were achieved. The analysis showed that QIVc prevented RT-
PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza caused by any Type A or B strain in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age 
(primary efficacy endpoint) and 3 to < 18 years of age (co-primary endpoint). The VE of QIVc in children 
2 to < 18 years of age was 54.6% (95% CI: 45.7 to 62.1). Success criterion were met as the LL of the 2-
sided 95% CI was above 20%. The VE of QIVc in children 3 to < 18 years of age was 54.0% (95% CI: 
44.8 to 61.7). The success criterion was met as the LL of 2-sided 95% CI for VE is above 30%. Moreover, 
the secondary efficacy objectives that were efficacy against RT-PCR or culture-confirmed influenza in the 
overall study population 2 to < 18 years of age either due to any influenza type A or B strain or due to 
influenza type A or B antigenically matched strains were also met. The VE numbers were 54.63% (95% 
CI [45.67, 62.12]) for PCR-confirmed regardless of antigenic match, 60.81% (95% CI [51.30, 68.46]) for 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 63/67 
 
 
  
  
cultured-confirmed regardless of antigenic match, and 63.64% (95% CI [53.64; 71.48]) for culture-
confirmed and matched to the strains contained in the vaccine.  
The VE was also analysed in several age cohorts, with similar results to those obtained in the overall 
study. 
All the data and analysis are considered adequate, and robust to support the indication for prevention of 
influenza in adults and children from 2 years of age and older. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The trial did not include subjects with underlying diseases (such as respiratory, immunocompromised, 
etc.) which are representative of the risk groups for which the influenza vaccine is routinely 
recommended. However, based on previous experience with influenza vaccines some of the underlying 
diseases (such as respiratory diseases that do not influence the immune response to the antigen) are not 
expected to impact the vaccine efficacy. On the other hand, it is noted that immune response of 
immunosuppressed subjects may not be optimal, but this aspect is reflected in the SmPC.  
Concomitant administration with other vaccines was not assessed, particularly those recommended in the 
childhood immunization programs. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the initial MAA of Flucelvax Tetra, data were presented from study V130_03. In this study, a total of 
2333 subjects 4 to < 18 years of age were enrolled, including 1161 in the 4 to < 9 years age group and 
1171 in the 9 to <18 years age group. The solicited safety set included 1135 subjects exposed to QIVc, 
570 to TIV1c, and 563 to TIV2c, while the unsolicited safety set included 1149 subjects exposed to QIVc, 
579 to TIV1c, and 570 to TIV2c. 
The rates of reported solicited local and systemic AEs in study V130_03 were generally similar to those 
reported in study V130_12, which is the scope of this variation. Nevertheless, some differences were 
observed, especially in the solicited local AEs, in which less events were reported in study V130_12 than 
in the previous V130_03 study. 
The rates of reported solicited local and systemic AEs during the treatment period (recorded at 30 
minutes following vaccination and from 6 hours through Day 7 after vaccination) were comparable 
between the 2 vaccine groups in subjects 2 to <18 years of age.  
The rates of solicited AEs reported within 30 minutes after any vaccination were reported as low but  
slightly higher in the QIVc group (9.5%) compared to the comparator group (7.3%). The percentage of 
subjects with any solicited AE reported from Day 1 through Day 7 after vaccination was 51.4% in the 
QIVc and 48.6% in the comparator group. Regarding the solicited local AEs, similar rates were observed 
in each vaccine group  (36.9% in the QIVc group and 33.6% in the comparator group), as  no notable 
differences were observed between the QIVc and the comparator. Nevertheless a slightly higher rate of 
pain, but a slightly lower rate of induration and erythema was reported in the QIVc group vs the 
comparator. The most commonly reported solicited local AEs were erythema, pain and tenderness; the 
majority were mild to moderate in severity. 
Regarding the solicited systemic AEs, similar rates were reported in each vaccine group (31.4% in the 
QIVc group and 30.5% in the comparator group) as no notable differences were observed between the 
QIVc and the comparator. Nevertheless, a slightly higher rate of headache, but a slightly lower rate of 
feeling fatigue or tiredness was reported in the QIVc vs the comparator group. The most commonly 
reported solicited systemic AEs were headache, feeling fatigue or tiredness and the majority were mild to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/276144/2020 
Page 64/67 
 
 
  
  
moderate in severity. Fever (≥38ºC) was reported by 5.3% and 4.5% in QIVc and comparator group, 
respectively. 
The rates of unsolicited AEs were comparable between the 2 vaccine groups in the subjects of 2 to <18 
years of age. Only 4.3% and 3.9 % were considered to be at least possibly related to the study vaccine 
and to the comparator vaccine by the investigator. 
No SAEs (1.1% and 1.3% in QIVc and comparator group, respectively) and deaths (one in comparator 
group) reported were assessed as related to the vaccination with the study vaccine. No AEs leading to 
withdrawal from the study were reported after the vaccination with QIVc. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
It appears that ethnical differences have a small impact on the rates of solicited AEs. In fact, comparing 
the rates reported by any solicited AEs in the new V130_12 study in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age with 
the study V130_03 performed in 4 to <18 years of age group, the data observed in the QIVc group were 
lower in the new study (51.4% and 72% respectively). Approximately 50% of enrolled subjects in study 
V130_12 were Asian, and another 50% were White (Table 10-6 of the V130_12 CSR). In study V130_03, 
the majority of enrolled subjects were White, with <1% (9 children) of Asian origin. After stratification by 
ethnic origin it is observed that the lower rate of solicited local AEs in study V130_12 was substantially 
driven by the results observed in the Asian population since the rates of each solicited local AE appeared 
to be lower in Asian subjects compared to White subjects. The MAH states that a difference in the 
reporting rates of solicited local AEs in Asian versus White paediatric subjects has also been observed in 
other studies conducted by Seqirus. The effect observed does not alter the B/R assessment of this 
vaccine.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The submitted efficacy data from study V130_12 demonstrate that Flucelvax Tetra is efficacious in 
preventing influenza in children 2 to < 18 years and in children 3 to < 18 years of age .  The observed VE 
in subjects 2 to < 18 years of age (primary endpoint) was 54.63%, and the lower bound of the 95% CI 
was greater than 20% (95% CI: 45.67; 62.12). The observed VE in subjects 3 to < 18 years of age (co-
primary endpoint) was 54.03%, and the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 30%. All secondary 
endpoints were consistent with the primary study endpoint.  
In terms of safety, the safety profile for Flucelvax Tetra in children 2 to 18 years of age is in general 
comparable to that of the non-influenza comparator vaccine.  No new safety signal has been observed in 
the submitted clinical database. It can be concluded that QIVc vaccine in subjects 2 to <9 years of age 
does not raise any relevant safety issue. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Taking into consideration all the above, it is concluded that the clinical data (efficacy and safety) support 
the indication from 2 years of age and above.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Flucelvax Tetra in children 2 to 18 years is considered positive.

Extension of the indication of prophylaxis of influenza, from the currently approved age range "adults and 
children from 9 years of age" to "adults and children from 2 years of age" for Flucelvax Tetra; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 2.1 of the RMP has also been approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0084/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above.

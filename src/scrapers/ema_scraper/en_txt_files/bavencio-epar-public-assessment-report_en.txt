1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Serono Europe Limited submitted on 6 October 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Bavencio, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 September 2016. 
Bavencio was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1590 on 14 December 2015 in the 
following condition: Treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Bavencio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Bavencio as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MCC is a very rare cutaneous neoplasm belonging to the group of neuroendocrine tumours. MCC is an 
aggressive disease with frequent locoregional recurrences, visceral metastatic evolution, and a high 
mortality rate.1, 2 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Incidence rates for Merkel cell carcinoma from the European Union (EU) are in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 per 
100,000. Its incidence is 0.2-0.4 cases/100 000 individuals / year in Europe, while in the US it is 0.79 and 
in Australia 1.6 (where it is most linked to ultraviolet exposure). The median age at diagnosis is around 75 
years. A minority of cases are metastatic at presentation, 5-12%. The overall 5-year survival for 
node-negative disease is 64%, in regional nodal disease at presentation is 39% and drops to 18% in the 
metastatic setting. 
Merkel cell carcinoma is associated with UV exposure, Merkel cell polyomavirus, immunosuppression 
(8-10% of the MCC patients, mainly in relation to CLL, organ transplant, HIV infection and elderly 
Caucasians (≥65 yo). A history of extensive sun exposure is a major risk factor for MCC. Most MCC 
tumours are located on sun exposed areas, with 36% being diagnosed on the face. The incidence of MCC 
is higher in geographic areas with a greater solar ultraviolet (UV) B index. 3, 4 Immunosuppression has 
been determined as an important risk factor, although the majority of patients with MCC are 
immunocompetent.5 MCC risk is increased by ~10-fold after solid organ transplantation6, by ~13-fold

among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients7, and by ~12-fold among patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)8. Consistent with the association of MCC with immunosuppression, 
viral involvement in the etiology of MCC has been shown recently. The literature describes compelling 
evidence for a causal link between Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV) and MCC9 . MCPyV, a 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus, is detected in approximately 80% of patients with MCC10 . MCC tumour 
regression has been reported following improvement in immune system function in immune compromised 
individuals11, 12 , 13. However, the viral-negative subtypes have high mutational burdens characterised by 
UV signature events, supporting sun damage etiology14. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The biologic features of MCC are dependent on the etiology. Patients which have a history of extensive 
sun exposure have been shown to have a high mutational burden and increased expression of 
neoantigens. The majority of MCV negative MCCs have p53 mutations as well as other mutations present 
in varying degrees (including NOTCH, NF1, FGF receptor 2 and the PI3K/AKT pathway). The role of 
polyomavirus integrated into the DNA of the Merkel tumour tissue (identified in 2008) in the pathogenesis 
of MCC is still unclear. MCV is reported in approximately 80% of MCC tumours. MCV is ubiquitous in the 
general population and is believed to be acquired in childhood as an asymptomatic primary 
infection15, 16, 17. However, the value of baseline Merkel cell polyoma virus serology as prognostic factor 
and to assess disease recurrence is currently unclear. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of MCC is rarely clinically suspected, since the primary tumour lacks distinguishing 
characteristic features. Therefore, the diagnosis of MCC is based on histologic features of the tumour 
itself 18. The American Joint Committee on Cancer has proposed the following anatomic staging 
framework for MCC: Stage 0 - in situ tumour; Stage I and II - negative lymph nodes; Stage IIIa includes 
both occult nodal disease and unknown primary disease; Stage IIIbincludes those with a known primary 
tumour and clinically detected regional metastatic disease; and Stage IV - distant metastasis beyond 
regional lymph nodes.

The prognosis for mMCC is poor, with a median survival of 9.6 months from the time of diagnosis of 
distant mMCC19.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There are currently no approved therapies for recurrent, non-resectable or metastatic Merkel cell 
carcinoma, a clearcut unmet medical need. In clinical practice chemotherapy and radiotherapy is used in 
the first-line setting of mMCC (NCCN 2017). In June 2015, a collaborative group of multidisciplinary 
experts form the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), The European Association of Dermato-Oncology 
(EADO) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) published a 
European consensus based interdisciplinary guideline on diagnosis and treatment of Merkel Cell 
Carcinoma – the European Consensus Guideline20 . It made recommendations on MCC diagnosis and 
management, based on a critical review of the literature, existing guidelines and expert’s experience. The 
European Consensus Guideline recommends a multidisciplinary treatment approach with lymph node 
dissection and/or radiation therapy (RT), and consideration for adjuvant chemotherapy in the presence of 
metastatic MCC. The most common chemotherapy regimen used is a platinum compound ± etoposide, 
with short term control of the disease and no durable responses (recurrence in 4-15 months) and high 
toxicity. CAV is the second most used regimen, with response rates of 76%, with significant toxicities. The 
median PFS for chemotherapy is about 2 months. 
Table 1:  
Stage IV MCC responses reported in the literature 
A small phase II trial of pembrolizumab in the first-line setting of Stage IIIb/IV reported a 71% initial 
response rate in 17 evaluable patients21 . The published study reported a total of 26 patients receiving at 
least one dose of pembrolizumab. The ORR among the 25 patients with at least one post-baseline 
evaluation was 56% (95% CI 35 to 76), with 4 CR and 10 PR. During a 33 weeks’ follow-up (range 7-53), 
2/14 relapsed. The DOR varied between 2.2 and 9.7 months. The rate of PFS at 6 months was 67%. 17/26 
patients were MCV positive; the RR in MCV+ patients was 62% (10/16) and 44% for MCV- tumors (4/9).  
With regard to other immune-checkpoint inhibitors, there are published case reports with nivolumab in 
MCC22 .  
Responses to molecularly targeted therapy (e.g. pazopanib) and somatostatin analogues have been 
reported in literature, and some phase II trials with this class of compounds are ongoing23 .

About the product 
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the ligand to PD-1 receptor and may be expressed on the surface 
of either tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating immune cells. It has been shown to contribute to the 
inhibition of the anti-tumour immune response in the tumour microenvironment.  
Avelumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against programmed 
death ligand 1 (PD L1). Avelumab binds PD L1 and blocks the interaction between PD L1 and the 
programmed death 1 (PD 1) and B7.1 receptors. This removes the suppressive effects of PD L1 on 
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, resulting in the restoration of anti-tumour T cell responses. 
Avelumab has also shown to induce natural killer (NK) cell mediated direct tumour cell lysis via antibody 
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
•  Bavencio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma

For instructions on the preparation and administration of the medicinal product, see SmPC section 6.6. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
This application falls under the scope of the regulation No507/2006 for medicinal products designated as 
orphan medicinal product and to treat a life-threatening disease in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14(7) of the above mentioned Regulation based on the following claim(s): 
• 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive. 
The applicant claims that given the durability of response with features such as responses in large tumours 
or visceral sites and prolonged responses after discontinuation of treatment, together with a safety profile 
that is manageable and consistent with the overall avelumab program, the pivotal clinical data suggest that 
avelumab has a favourable benefit/risk profile in patients with mMCC.

• 
It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
The applicant conducted a single arm study in treatment naïve patients with metastatic Merkel cell 
carcinoma in a highly similar population as with the pivotal and observational studies, all in  Stage IV 
disease, to serve as a confirmatory study relative to the initial conditional application in patients with 
treatment experience. The design of this study has been subject to discussions at the SAWP. As the 
treatment landscape had changed with the early results of efficacy with pembrolizumab in naive patients 
with mMCC(IIIb/IV), it was no longer feasible to conduct a comparative phase III trial of avelumab vs 
chemotherapy as problems with recruitment would be anticipated in the chemotherapy arm. Therefore, it 
was agreed that confirmatory data will be provided from: 
−  Study EMR100070-003 (Part B) in 1st line therapy which is ongoing. The applicant anticipated 
that approximately 10-15 subjects would reach 3 months of observation so as to enable 
submission of preliminary efficacy data during the procedure.  
− 
In addition supportive data from the Observational Study 100070-Obs001 (Part A) – cohort in 
1st line therapy which is completed – and the 1L literature based data from Iyer et al, 2016 
would support the efficacy data. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. 
The unmet medical need will be addressed, as there are no authorised medicinal products for mMCC and 
current treatment options have limited efficacy for metastatic disease.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product 
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The applicant considers that the benefits to public health (the durable response rate compared to 
chemotherapy) outweigh the risks. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a clear, colourless to slightly yellow concentrate for solution for 
infusion, containing 20 mg/ml of avelumab as active substance. 
Other ingredients are mannitol, glacial acetic acid, polysorbate 20, sodium hydroxide and water for 
injections.  
The product is available in a 10 ml vial (Type I glass) with a halobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium 
seal fitted with a removable plastic cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Avelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody based on a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1 λ) 
framework. The recombinant antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and consists of 
two heavy chains (HC) of 450 amino acid residues each and two light chains (LC) of 216 amino acid 
residues each with typical IgG1 inter and intra chain disulfide bonds.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 12/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Avelumab has primarily a β-sheet structure, consistent with the structure of an IgG-1 antibody. The 
typical nine disulphide bonds of IgG were confirmed as: 
• 
• 
Intra-chain disulfide bonds: Cys138-Cys197; Cys22-Cys96; Cys147-Cys203; Cys264-Cys324; 
Cys370-Cys428; Cys22-Cys90;  
Inter-chain disulfide bonds: Cys215–Cys223; Cys229-Cys229; Cys232-Cys232. The molecule 
contains one N-glycosylation site on Asn-300 of the heavy chain.  
N-glycan structures identified were complex, biantennary type core fucosylated oligosaccharides with 
zero (G0F), one (G1F), or two galactose (G2F) residues. The molecular weight of the intact avelumab 
molecule, calculated on the basis of amino acid composition and predicted disulfide bonding of the 
predominant isoform is 143’832 Da (approximately 147’000 Da with glycosylation).  
Avelumab mechanism of action is based on the inhibition of the interaction between PD-L1 and its 
receptors programmed death 1 (PD-1) and B7.1. This removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on 
anti-tumor CD8+ T cells, resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.  
The biological activity (potency) of avelumab is evaluated through a cell based assay able to measure its 
capability to bind the PD-L1 receptor over-expressed on the recombinant HEK-293 (hPD-L1) cell line.  
Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) represents an additional mechanism of action of 
avelumab and was confirmed by in vitro testing.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Information about the manufacturing, storage and control facilities for the active substance has been 
provided in the dossier. GMP compliance for the manufacturers has been demonstrated.  
The avelumab active substance is manufactured at Merck Serono SA, Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. 
The manufacturing process is a cultivation process with nutritive feeds. One vial of the working cell bank 
(WCB) is thawed and the cell culture is expanded in shake tubes, wave bags and seeding bioreactors. The 
production bioreactor is harvested after a defined production period and a clarification is performed. 
The purification process includes three chromatography steps as well as viral inactivation/clearance 
steps, ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF), final formulation and final filtration (0.22 μm).  
The purification process has been described in sufficient detail, providing lists of process parameters and 
their acceptance criteria, for each step. Typical elution profiles have been provided for the three 
chromatography steps.  
Avelumab active substance is stored in polyethylene bags at 2-8°C and shipped to the finished product 
manufacturing facility at controlled conditions. 
Dimensions and specifications of the bags have been provided in the dossier. The compatibility of the 
container for storage of active substance has been evaluated. A summary of an extractable and leachable 
study was presented and concluded that the risk for patients due to substances leaching into avelumab 
active substance is negligible.  
Control of materials  
Raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process are sufficiently described and 
controlled. Tests for adventitious agents are performed according to regulatory guidelines.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 13/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
A description of the generation of cell substrate and the cell banking system has been provided. The 
construction of the expression vector, the host cell line used, the transfection and the isolation of cell line 
have been described in an acceptable way. The preparation of the cell banks have been described in 
sufficient detail. 
An expression vector, coding for both antibody chains of avelumab, was generated and stably introduced 
into the CHO-S host cell line, grown in animal component-free medium. Genotypic and phenotypic 
characterization of the Master Cell Bank (MCB), Working Cell Bank (WCB) and Extended Cell Bank (ExCB) 
was performed to confirm identity, purity and stability of the cell lines, according to ICH Q5B and ICH 
Q5D.  
A protocol for production and qualification of future WCBs has been presented. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
A list of In-process Controls (IPCs), including a test for amino acid misincorporation, and the 
corresponding acceptance criteria or action limits for the cell cultivation and purification process have 
been provided (viability, bioburden, endotoxin, filter integrity and step yield). The control of critical steps 
and intermediates has been sufficiently described and is found acceptable.  
Process validation 
The validation of the avelumab active substance manufacturing process was performed using several 
consecutive full scale batches, manufactured using the proposed commercial process. The production 
reactor step and the purification process was appropriately validated. Numerical results for all Critical 
Process Parameters (CPPs) and IPCs were presented, together with profiles from chromatograms.  
Removal of process and product related impurities have been evaluated in the frame of the process 
validation studies. The levels of impurities have been assessed and the impurity control strategy justified.  
Impurities were tested at one or several purification steps, to demonstrate their clearance (DNA, 
Host-Cell Protein (HCP), residual protein A, High Molecular Weight (HMW) species, Low Molecular Weight 
(LMW) species). The removal of process-related impurities (HCP, protein A and DNA) was further 
supported by batch analysis results, showing low levels of impurities in all clinical trial batches. The 
results, regarding removal of impurities, from the validation data together with the batch analysis data 
from clinical trials batches were found acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development 
A traditional process characterization approach was used for the characterization range studies (one 
factor at a time; OFAT). No multivariate experiments were performed or design space claimed. The 
process characterization results were presented in sufficient detail and were considered acceptable. A 
comprehensive control strategy was presented, describing the strategy for each individual critical quality 
attribute (CQA).  
The nonclinical studies (including the pivotal toxicology study) and initial clinical studies were conducted 
using avelumab material derived from the initial manufacturing process (also denominated Process A) 
produced at Merck Bio development facility, Martillac (MBD), France. The avelumab manufacturing 
process has undergone one major change that aimed at developing an optimized process with higher 
performance in order to mainly fulfil clinical development program and product launch needs. The new 
process was denoted process B.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 14/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
An extensive comparability exercise between processes A and B was performed. The Applicant provided 
background information and details about the process differences and a rationale for the proposed 
changes.  
The results demonstrated comparability for most of the quality attributes except for some minor 
quantitative differences. However, no impact of these differences was observed on biological activity.  
Since the differences are considered minor, the Applicant’s conclusion that the two materials can be 
considered comparable is endorsed.  
Characterization 
Avelumab is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1. 
Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and the programmed death 1 (PD- 1) 
and B7.1 receptors. This is the main mode of action. 
An extensive list of analytical methods has been applied for structural and biological characterization of 
avelumab. The majority of the characterization has been performed on one batch only; the currently used 
reference material. As much of the same tests were performed in the comparability studies, the use of 
only one batch is acceptable.  
In general, the substance demonstrated characteristics that are typical of a human IgG1. The biological 
functional analyses evaluated during the characterization are well chosen with respect to the mode of 
action. 
Amino acid substitution was detected in avelumab reference material in the frame of the characterization 
studies.  
With regards to the characterization of impurities, this topic has been adequately addressed. Low levels 
of process-related impurities (HCP, DNA and residual protein A) were demonstrated during batch 
analysis.  
The product related impurities HMW (aggregates) and LMW (fragments) were discussed. 
Specification 
Avelumab quality control testing for batch release includes appearance (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), purity, 
identity, quantity, potency, process-related impurities and endotoxins/bioburden (Ph. Eur.). The 
biological activity is tested using a cell-based bioassay.  
The proposed release specification for the active substance is found acceptable, with respect to test 
methods chosen. The proposed specification limits are based on batch analysis and stability study results. 
This approach is considered acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods used for testing of the active substance have been described in the dossier. 
Biological activity is determined using an in vitro cell binding assay.  
Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) represents an additional mechanism of action of 
avelumab. Both PD-L1 binding and ADCC have been classified as CQAs. The Applicant has confirmed a 
correlation between afucosylated glycan species of avelumab and its ADCC activity.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 15/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis from an extensive number of  batches used in clinical studies, stability studies and process 
validation, all manufactured using process B, has been provided. The results confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
A one-tiered approach is used with respect to reference standards for avelumab. The currently used 
reference originates from a GMP batch manufactured at Merck Serono S.A Vevey, Switzerland, according 
to the manufacturing process proposed for commercial purpose, used in clinical studies, and has been 
qualified. The Applicant plans to replace the current standard with a Primary Reference.  
The suggested protocols for establishment of a primary reference standard and working standard are in 
general considered acceptable.  
The comparison between two historical reference standards demonstrated in general similar 
characteristics. However, a few differences were noted. The differences observed are further discussed in 
the comparability assessment, and are considered acceptable.  
Stability 
Stability has been demonstrated by real time data from both primary batches (manufactured using 
process B and stored in a representative container closure system) and supportive batches 
(manufactured using process A).  
Stability data for the active substance stored under long-term (5±3°C), accelerated and stressed 
conditions was provided. 
For the primary batches, long-term data was provided for up to 24 months (3 batches) under long-term 
(5°C±3C). Data from active substance stored under accelerated conditions was provided for up to 6 
months and stressed conditions for up to 3 months. 
For the supportive batches, long-term data was provided for up to 36 months and accelerated data for up 
to 6 months. 
The data submitted on support the proposed shelf life of 24 months for the active substance when stored 
at the recommended temperature of 5 ± 3°C.  
All stability studies will be tested and controlled using the final, agreed limits in the release specification.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Avelumab finished product is a concentrate for solution for infusion presented at the concentration of 20 
mg/mL. The product is available in a vial (Type I glass) with a halobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium 
seal fitted with a removable plastic cap. One vial of 10 mL contains 200 mg of avelumab, mannitol and 
polysorbate 20 in a preservative-free acetate-buffered solution pH 5.0-5.6. 
The formulation development has been adequately described and the final formulation intended for 
marketing was used in the phase III clinical trials.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 16/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
To investigate leachable compounds a stability study was conducted in the commercial primary container 
closure system. The conclusion from the Applicant that the risk for patients treated with avelumab 
finished product due to leachables is negligible seems reasonable based on data and worst case 
calculations presented in the dossier. The container closure is considered suitable for its intended use and 
a risk assessment for the potential glass delamination has been included, as requested.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at Merck Serono SA, Aubonne, Switzerland.  
The avelumab finished product manufacturing process consists of active substance pooling, filtration 
through a 0.2 μm sterilizing grade filter, aseptic filling of the pre formulated active substance and visual 
inspection. All filled vials are visually checked, discarding those with defects. After the inspection process, 
the vials are stored at 5° ± 3°C pending labelling and packaging.  
The description of the manufacturing process has been provided in sufficient detail.  
To ensure that the finished product meets high quality standards, its manufacturing process was 
developed with defined manufacturing procedures, CPPs, IPCs, and release specifications.  
Process validation 
For the process validation studies minimum, medium and maximum size batches were produced. All 
validation batches complied with the established in-process and release specifications as well as 
additional process monitoring data. No critical deviations were observed.  
For the sterile filtration step appropriate filter validation studies have been performed by the filter 
manufacturer at worst case conditions. The aseptic filling has been sufficiently validated with media fills 
covering the maximum duration of filling. No growth was detected.  
All proposed maximum process hold times have been covered in the process validation.  
Product specification 
The finished product Quality Control for batch release includes identity, potency, purity, impurities, 
sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) and several other general tests. 
For many tests the same acceptance criteria are proposed for active substance and finished product. The 
initially proposed specification based on the use of process capability analysis was not endorsed. For 
parameters related to efficacy and safety it is normally expected that the main basis for setting limits is 
the actual levels qualified through clinical studies. Upon request the Applicant has tightened the limits for 
some CQAs. The applicant also tightened the specifications for the active substance as appropriate to be 
able to fulfil the revised finished product specifications.  
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods used for testing of the finished product are satisfactorily described in the dossier 
and non-compendial methods have been validated. Many test methods used for release testing and 
stability testing of the finished product are the same as those used for release testing and stability testing 
of the active substance.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 17/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for an extensive number finished product batches manufactured at Merck Serono SA, 
Aubonne and using avelumab active substance from Process B (commercial process) have been provided. 
The results demonstrate a satisfactory batch to batch consistency.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used in the testing and release of avelumab finished product is the same as the 
one used for the testing and release of avelumab active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for the finished product is 24 months when stored at 2- 8ºC protected from light.  
The stability program was designed in accordance with relevant ICH guidelines and included primary 
stability batches as well as supportive stability batches. The primary stability program included finished 
product batches to support long term storage at 5±3°C. Accelerated stability studies and stressed 
stability studies were also performed. All primary finished product stability batches were produced using 
active substance from the manufacturing process intended for commercial use (Process B). The container 
closure system used in the primary stability studies is identical to the one intended for the storage of the 
commercial finished product. 
For the primary batches, long-term data was provided for up to 24 months (3 batches). Data from 
finished product stored under accelerated conditions was provided for up to 6 months and stressed 
conditions for up to 3 months. 
At long term storage all test parameters remained within the specification limits and no significant 
changes were observed for any of the parameters tested.  
A photostability study was conducted on one finished product batch in accordance with ICH Q1B. The 
study was conducted on vials (immediate pack), directly exposed to light without the secondary 
packaging and on vials stored in their secondary packaging. Results support the recommended storage 
condition for the finished product vials protected from light and demonstrate that the secondary 
packaging is suitable to provide sufficient light protection throughout the shelf-life. 
A cumulative stability study (covering 24 months of storage for the active substance and 24 months of 
storage for the finished product) is currently ongoing and any unexpected trends or out of specification 
results will be reported.  
Data has been presented to support the claimed in-use stability of the diluted solution (up to 24 hours at 
20 - 25°C) and the compatibility with infusion solution containers. It is also noted that the use of a filter 
is recommended during clinical administration. 
Based on the data provided the proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8ºC is considered acceptable. 
Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Product 
The initial avelumab finished product was formulated at a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL using 
avelumab active substance from the initial manufacturing process (process A) with a fill volume of 8 mL. 
This formulation was used throughout the early development program, e.g., nonclinical studies, Phase 
I/II clinical trials and part A of the Phase II mMCC study.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 18/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
To support clinical development and commercial use, an optimized formulation of avelumab at a higher 
concentration (20 mg/mL) was designed. This formulation was prepared using avelumab active 
substance from an optimised manufacturing process (process B). This formulation (current composition) 
has been used in all Phase III clinical trials as well as in the expansion cohorts of Phase I trial and part B 
of the Phase II mMCC study. It is identical to the to-be-marketed formulation.  
Finished product comparability studies were conducted in order to demonstrate that the quality of the 
commercial manufacturing process is comparable to the pre-change product. All quantitative batch 
analysis results post-change were within the 95% and 99% tolerance intervals for pre-change product 
except for pH, avelumab content, and the extractable volume that were intentionally adjusted to different 
values based on formulation development.  
Electrophoretic purity was comparable among tested samples in terms of purity level and aligned with 
expectations and the target product profile.  Comparable results were also obtained for potency. In 
addition, the currently available stability data show no difference between pre- and post-change product.  
Adventitious agents 
No substances of animal origin were used in the manufacturing process for Bavencio. Neither the culture 
media nor the raw materials used in its manufacture were derived from bovine or other animal sources.  
The unprocessed bulk harvests are routinely checked for the absence of bacteria and fungi, mycoplasma 
as well as in vitro detection of virus. All harvests tested were found to be negative.  
The retroviral like particles (rVLP) of crude harvest samples were quantified by density gradient 
centrifugation and negative stain Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Based on the results of the 
virus clearance studies and TEM results for unprocessed bulk harvest, the estimated maximum number of 
rVLP particles per clinical dose is considered acceptable.  
Overall, the safety of avelumab in relation to adventitious agents is considered adequate.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Adequate data has been 
presented which give reassurance on viral and TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All in vitro and in vivo primary and secondary pharmacology studies were not conducted under GLP 
conditions. In vivo studies were performed in mice, rats and monkeys. Most repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations.  
Basic pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of avelumab were investigated in nonclinical PK studies in mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys after single iv administration. Multiple dose pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (TK) 
data were obtained during the course of repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and cynomolgus 
monkeys. Immunogenicity was evaluated in the single dose PK studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, 
in the 4-week toxicity studies in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys and during the course of the pivotal 
13-week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C and MSB0010718) is a fully human monoclonal antibody. During 
the development of avelumab, different versions of the antibody have been used in the nonclinical 
pharmacology studies. Two other closely-related antibodies were used where indicated (MSB0010608H 
and MSB0010294). MSB0010608H has the same sequence as avelumab but was produced by transient 
transfection of HEK293 cells. MSB0010294 was the parental version of avelumab. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro primary pharmacodynamics 
Kinetics of PD-L1 occupancy in non-tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice (IONC03082013RT) 
A PK study was performed in non-tumour bearing mice study to support pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling 
and human dose predictions for avelumab. A FACS-based assay was used to determine the percentage of 
PD-L1 target occupancy on splenocytes (left figure) or peripheral blood leukocytes (right figure). 
Figure 1: 
Kinetics of PD-L1 Occupancy by Avelumab in Splenocytes 
All doses of avelumab tested showed similar levels of PD-L1 target occupancy (~75-100%) on peripheral 
blood and splenocytes on days 2 and 5. Dose-dependent decreases in target occupancy were observed on 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 20/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
days 8 and 12. By Day 12, only the highest dose level of 400 μg still showed significant occupancy 
(~50%). 
Study PEAT18052012BJW - Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity against Human Cancer Cells  
The CDC potential of avelumab was investigated in vitro against the A431, A549, and M21 human tumour 
cell lines. Target cells were radiolabeled with 51Cr and then incubated with various concentrations of 
avelumab (ranging from 2.43 to 10,000 ng/ml) for 45 minutes in the presence of complete human 
complement. The amount of 51Cr released into supernatants was measured as an indicator of CDC 
activity. As a positive control, a previously characterized CDC competent antibody, 14.18.IL2, was tested 
against the M21 cell line. Two negative control antibodies were used: the inactive version of avelumab 
and the anti-EGFR antibody, Erbitux (cetuximab). The results are shown below:

Cancer Cells 
In vivo primary pharmacodynamics 
Dose-dependent anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy in the MC38 colon carcinoma model 
(IONC20042011AKH) 
In all of the in vivo pharmacology studies, 3  administrations of avelumab were given, with three days 
between each treatment (e.g., treatment on days 0, 3, and 6) in order to maximize drug exposure prior 
to the onset of an ADA response. 
Avelumab showed activity against MC38 tumors and the anti-tumor effect was associated with consistent 
modulation of T cell phenotypes, including increased levels of splenic CD8+PD-1+ T cells and increased 
levels of CD8+ T cells with an effector memory phenotype. MC38 tumors express an endogenous murine 
retroviral protein, p15E, which has been identified as a tumor-associated CD8+ T-cell antigen. 
Frequencies of p15E-specific T cells were determined using a fluorescently-labeled synthetic MHC class I 
pentamer loaded with a p15E-derived antigenic peptide epitope. Treatment with avelumab was 
associated with an increased frequency of p15E antigen-specific CD8+ T cells

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A secondary pharmacology study was performed to investigate the potential off-target effect of avelumab 
to induce ADCC against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The data demonstrated that, under 
conditions of in vitro immune stimulation that upregulated PD-L1 expression by immune cells, avelumab 
failed to induce detectable killing of any of the immune cell subsets analysed, including the CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells. Tumor cells used as positive control displaying a higher PD-L1 expression level were 
subject to ADCC-mediated killing. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
As per guideline ICH S6(R1), the investigation of safety pharmacologically relevant parameters was 
included in the pilot 4 week iv repeat-dose toxicity study and in the pivotal 13-week iv repeat-dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. In both studies the heart rate, electrocardiogram, arterial blood 
pressure, respiratory rate, CNS parameters, and body temperature were unaffected by treatment with 
avelumab at the high dose level of 140 mg/kg weekly.

Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics and exposure margins 
In all three species evaluated (mice, rats, monkeys), exposure to avelumab increased roughly 
dose-proportionally. There was no gender difference in exposure. Accumulation was observed in rats 
(marked) and monkeys (moderate). The T1/2 was 60-80 hrs in mice, > 100 hrs in rats and 58-70 hrs in 
monkeys.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 28/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Plasma exposure (AUC) achieved in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys exceeded the human 
therapeutic exposure by 10- to 15-fold. Due to the finding of perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates in 
the brain and spinal cord at all dose levels in the 13-week monkey study, there was no NOAEL in this study 
and accordingly only a LOAEL, which was 1.5-fold above the human therapeutic exposure. 
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of avelumab was evaluated within repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
At the infusion site in cynomolgus monkeys, there was an increased severity of haemorrhage, 
subcutaneous fibroplasia and mononuclear cell infiltration at > 20 mg/kg as compared to controls, 
suggesting local irritative properties of avelumab.  
Other toxicity studies 
Cytokine release in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of humans and 
cynomolgus monkeys  
Multiple Th1 and Th2 cytokines were measured in non-stimulated human or cynomolgus whole blood and 
PBMCs, following exposure to avelumab for 6 and 24 hours. In human whole blood, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β and 
IFNγ were mildly increased after 24 hours. Two female donors showed a marked induction of IL-6 release. 
In cynomolgus whole blood, minor increases in IL-6, IL-8, TNFα and IFNγ were seen in females. Larger 
increases in the release of these same cytokines (plus IL-1β) were seen in male whole blood. In human 
PBMCs, a significant increase in TNFα release was observed in both males and females after 24 hours (at 
avelumab concentrations > 14.38 ng/mL). Only minor effects on cytokines were observed in cynomolgus 
PBMCs. 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted a justification for the lack of studies concerning environmental assessment. 
According to the guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00), proteins are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
All in vitro and in vivo primary and secondary pharmacology studies were not conducted under GLP 
conditions. This is acceptable as the pharmacology of PD-L1 has been extensively studies and well known 
through the literature.  
Avelumab shows similar binding affinity for human, mouse and cynomolgus PD-L1.  
In in vitro assays, utilizing primary T cells of human or mouse origin, avelumab enhanced T-cell activation 
in a dose-dependent manner. Avelumab was also shown to exhibit ADCC activity against human tumour 
cell lines, but no CDC activity was observed. When combing tumour cells with peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells, ADCC activity was only directed against tumour cells, with no killing of any immune 
cell subsets. An in vivo contribution of ADCC to the anti-tumour effect of avelumab was demonstrated in 
the mouse tumour MC38 model. When using n ADCC-incompetent form of avelumab, generated through 
enzymatic deglycosylation, or by depleting NK cells (the main mediators of ADCC), a similar modest 
reduction in anti-tumor response was observed. These data suggest a role for ADCC in the anti-tumour

response. A decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes, due to marked reduction in cytotoxic T cells, was 
observed in mice treated with avelumab at > 20 mg/kg, once weekly injection, for 4 weeks. In a 
cynomolgus monkey 4-week, once weekly infusion, study decreased total lymphocytes and NK cells 
occurred at 140 mg/kg.  
Cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system safety pharmacology parameters were 
incorporated in the cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies instead of being conducted as stand-alone 
studies, which is considered acceptable. Apart from a transient, not statistically significant, increase in 
arterial blood pressure at 140 mg/kg, no treatment-related findings were observed.  
Repeated administration of avelumab to CD-1 mice caused severe anaphylactic reactions, resulting in the 
death of up to 46% of the animals. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation was detected in 38.9% of the 
mice, with highest incidence in the low and intermediate dose groups (where also most of the deaths 
occurred). A mechanistic study supported the hypothesis that the mortalities were caused by an 
immune-mediated anaphylactic reaction (IgG/IgE mediated), primarily driven by IgG isotype antibodies.  
It is unlikely that anaphylactic reactions like this, triggered by an immune reaction against human protein 
in mice, would occur in the clinical setting. A low percentage (3.5%) of patients treated with avelumab 
has been reported to test positive for ADA (see clinical pharmacology). Nevertheless, immunogenicity is 
included as an important potential risk in the RMP, and is described under section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, infusion-related reactions including drug hypersensitivity and immune-related adverse 
reactions are included as important identified risks in the RMP and as warnings in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
Inflammatory changes in the liver, and/or increased AST and ALT levels, were observed in surviving mice 
as well as in cynomolgus monkeys. In the latter species, there was also a slight increase in C-reactive 
protein (a marker for inflammation) at 140 mg/kg. Avelumab’s mode of action removes the suppressive 
effects of PD-L1 on T cells, which may lead to decreases in self-tolerance and immune-related effects. 
Autoimmune hepatotoxicity has been reported in connection with PD-1 inhibitors24. Immune-related 
hepatitis is included as an Important identified risk in the RMP, and is described in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC. From a non-clinical perspective, no further action is considered needed. 
The applicant did not submit single dose toxicity studies. The lack of studies is acceptable as the results 
in cynomolgus monkeys following the 1st administration of avelumab up to 140 mg/kg (AUC exposure 
approximately 15-fold above human therapeutic exposure) indicate that the acute toxicity of avelumab is 
low. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated 
dose toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenously doses of 20, 60 or 140 mg/kg once a 
week for1 month and 3 months, followed by a 2-month recovery period after the 3-month dosing period. 
Perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing was observed in the brain and spinal cord of monkeys treated with 
avelumab at ≥ 20 mg/kg for 3 months. Although there was no clear dose-response relationship, it cannot 
be excluded that this finding was related to avelumab treatment. 
No dedicated metabolism studies were carried out with avelumab, as the expected consequence of the 
metabolism of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is the degradation to small peptides and individual 
amino acids. Guideline ICH S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals 
states that classical biotransformation studies need not be done.   
It is unknown whether avelumab is excreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can be 
secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is known that antibodies of

the IgG class can be secreted into breast milk25, therefore it is predicted that this may occur with 
avelumab. Therefore a statement has been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC that breast feeding 
women should be advised not to breast feed during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose 
due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast fed infants. 
No studies have been conducted to assess the potential of avelumab for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are generally not required for biotechnology-derived monoclonal 
antibodies such as avelumab (ICH S9).  
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been performed. Animal reproduction studies 
have not been conducted with avelumab. The PD 1/PD L1 pathway is thought to be involved in 
maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of PD L1 signalling has been shown 
in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in an increase in foetal loss. 
These results indicate a potential risk that administration of avelumab during pregnancy could cause 
foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. 
Fertility studies have not been conducted with avelumab. In 1-month and 3-month repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the female reproductive organs. Many of 
the male monkeys used in these studies were sexually immature and thus no explicit conclusions 
regarding effects on male reproductive organs can be made (SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3). 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with avelumab. However, in murine models of 
pregnancy, blockade of PD L1 signalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in 
an increased foetal loss (see section 5.3). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its mechanism 
of action, that administration of avelumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased 
rates of abortion or stillbirth (see section 4.6). There are no or limited data from the use of avelumab in 
pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while 
receiving avelumab and should use effective contraception during treatment with avelumab and for at 
least 1 month after the last dose of avelumab. 
Avelumab is a protein that undergoes breakdown into amino acids, and as such, does not pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of avelumab have been well 
characterised in the non-clinical aspects. The non-clinical aspects are considered to be appropriately 
addressed.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Bavencio is for intravenous infusion only. It must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus 
injection. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution during terminal phase (VZ) was estimated using non-compartmental analysis 
and was determined to 50.9 mL/kg (mean after single dose 10 mg/kg). The volumes of the central and 
peripheral compartments were also estimated in the Pop PK analysis and were 2.84 L and 1.21 L in the 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 33/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
typical subject, respectively. The geometric mean Vss (calculated from individual V1 and V2 parameter 
values) for a subject receiving 10 mg/kg was 4.72 L.  
Elimination 
Following IV administration of a 10 mg/kg dose the mean clearance determined by non-compartmental 
analysis was 0.36 mL/h/kg (study EMR100070-001). The corresponding mean half-life was 95 h (~4 
days). The Applicant points out that the t½ is shorter compared to other IgG1 antibodies (8-20 days) and 
endogenous IgG1 (30 days). According to the Applicant the shorter t½ could be due to the higher 
isoelectric point of avelumab (pI 8.5 – 9.3). From the PopPK analysis the estimated t½ was approximately 
6 days in subjects receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.       
No mass balance or metabolism studies of avelumab have been submitted. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose-normalized Cmax and AUC0-336hr after first dose were approximately similar across 3 to 20 
mg/kg. Ctrough increased proportionally with doses between 10 to 20 mg/kg, but more than proportionally 
for doses between 1 to 10 mg/kg, likely due to the presence of target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) 
at these lower dose levels.

169 and for subjects with more than 20% AUC extrapolation beyond the last sampling time within the first dosing 
interval. The full terminal phase may not have been captured as 336 hours (14 days) is less than 6 t 1/2 (36 days) 
and subjects with longer t 1/2 are more likely to have more than 20% AUC extrapolation beyond 336 h

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The PopPK analysis did not detect any relation between clearance of avelumab and renal function.

Figure 7: 
Influence of renal impairment on CL and inter-individual variability (IIV) CL 
Impaired hepatic function 
There was no clinical relevant influence of hepatic function in mild HI on avelumab CL in the final PopPK 
model (see Figure below). 
Figure 8: 
Influence of hepatic impairment on CL and inter-individual variability (IIV) CL 
Weight 
Body weight was identified to be a significant covariate for both CL and V1 (see Figure below for CL from 
the final PopPK model).

Figure 9: 
Influence of weight on CL and inter-individual variability CL (ETA1) 
Gender 
The influence of gender was evaluated in the PopPK analysis including 811 male and 818 female subjects. 
After accounting for body weight, gender was found to influence both CL (male subjects have a 19.9% 
higher CL relative to female subjects) and V1 (male subjects have a 20.3% higher V1 relative to female 
subjects). The final Pop PK model was used to perform simulations to compare exposure for each sex. The 
expected AUCss for female is slightly higher than that for male (see Figure below). The changes in 
avelumab PK due to gender after accounting for body weight appear to be small.

Elderly 
The influence of age was evaluated in the population PK analysis where the geometric mean age was 
63 years and ranged between 20 to 91 years (n=1629). No influence of age was detected on avelumab 
clearance (see Figure below for final popPK model).

Children 
The applicant did not submit data in children or adolescents. The safety and efficacy of Bavencio in 
children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established. 
Pharmacokinetic in the target population 
Pharmacokinetics has been documented and analysed in patient populations and not in healthy 
volunteers. For PK sparse blood samples were collected prior to each infusion through Week 15, then 
Week 25, and then at 12 week intervals while on treatment. Post infusion samples were collected at the 
end of infusion and 2 to 8 hours after the end of infusion at Weeks 1, 7, 13, and 25, and then at 12 week 
intervals while on treatment.   
The observed coefficients of variation (CV%) of geometric mean ranged from ca. 14% to 35% for the 
concentration at end of infusion (CEOI, Table 9) and from ca. 13% to 102% for Ctrough (Table 10). The 
mean avelumab concentration was 252 µg/mL (range 107 to 1108 µg/mL) at the end of infusion and 23.8 
µg/ml (range 1.58 to 245 µg/mL) at trough after the first dose. Both CEOI and Ctrough appeared to 
increase gradually over time (Table 9 and Table 10). Individual Ctrough over time is given in Figure 12).

Mechanism of action 
The applicant did not submit any studies on the mechanism of action (see clinical pharmacology section). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-response (E-R) 
The efficacy endpoints included in the exposure-efficacy analyses were BOR, PFS and OS. The 
exposure-efficacy analyses used data from 88 subjects with mMCC treated with avelumab in the pivotal 
study EMR100070-003. 
The adverse event (AE) categories analyzed in the exposure-safety analyses included irAE, IRR 
(infusion-related reactions), and TEAE. The exposure-safety analyses used data from all 1629 subjects 
treated with avelumab and who had PK data in Studies EMR100070-001, EMR100070-002 and 
EMR100070-003. 
A number of the presented analyses showed a positive relation between efficacy/safety variables and 
exposure. However, due to confounding factors related to disease status no conclusion is drawn about 
exposure-response for avelumab. 
Exposure-QTc analysis 
The QTc endpoints in the exposure-QTc analyses included QTcP and QTcF. A total of 2194 time-matched 
singlet locally-read 12-lead ECG and avelumab concentrations were collected from a total of 689 study 
subjects from Studies EMR100070-001, EMR100070-002, and EMR100070-003. 
The effect of avelumab concentration on ΔQTcP or ΔQTcF was minimal with a small and nonsignificant 
slope. 
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers 
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers included target occupancy (TO) of PD-L1 in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) and cytokine measurements in serum: 
•   In vitro TO: after the first infusion, TO was predicted to reach or exceed 95% throughout the entire 
dosing interval for 10 of 13 subjects at 3 mg/kg, and for all 12 subjects in the 10 mg/kg group from the 
dose-escalation cohort of Study EMR100070-001. A median target occupancy of 86.3% was observed 
prior to the second infusion on Day 15 in the 1 mg/kg cohort. In the 3 mg/kg cohort, the median target 
occupancy on Day 15 was 93.5%. A median target occupancy of 92.9% was observed in 10 mg/kg 
cohort on Day 15, while the median target occupancy was 89.1% in the 20 mg/kg cohort on Day 15. 
Overall, 3 mg/kg bi-weekly dose was sufficient to achieve high target occupancy in the circulation 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 40/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
throughout the entire dosing period for most of the subjects tested. The figure below reports TO in 
1,3,10 and 20 mg/mL cohorts on day 15 prior to the second avelumab infusion. 
Figure 13: 
Target occupancy in 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/mL cohorst assessed on Day 15 prior to 
the second avelumab infusion 
•   Ex vivo TO in PBMCs: 93.2 ± 1.29% TO throughout the dose interval at doses of 10 mg/kg once every 
2 weeks thus supporting in vitro observations.  
•  Levels of several major circulating cytokines were measured in Study EMR100070-001 over period of 
6 weeks, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNFα). After repeated administration of avelumab at 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, IFNγ and 
TNFα concentrations exhibited transient and mild change but remained low overall (e.g., 1.9 ± 1.6 
pg/mL on Day 15 for IFNγ). No apparent dose response was observed based on data collected from the 
1 to 20 mg/kg cohorts.  
The extent of TO in the tumor was not assessed in the dose-escalation cohort of Study EMR100070-001. 
No PD or biomarker information for the Expansion phase is available for this report. 
Immunogenicity 
For  study  EMR100070-001,  post-treatment  samples for  evaluation  of  anti-avelumab  antibody  (HAHA) 
responses were available for 45 of 53 subjects from the dose-escalation cohorts. The table below reports 
the HAHA incidence: 
Table 11: 
Human anti-human antibody: the incidence and percentage - dose escalation 
safety analysis set 
No subject had pre-existing HAHAs. Across the dose-escalation cohorts, 2 subjects (4.4 %), both in 
the  3  mg/kg  Cohort,  were  positive  for  treatment-emergent  HAHAs,  including  1  subject  who  was 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 41/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
persistent positive, with persistent defined as treatment emergent subjects with duration between first 
and last positive result ≥ 16 weeks or a positive evaluation at the last assessment. 
No subjects with hypersensitivity were identified from dose escalation at the time of analysis, so the IgE 
analysis was performed solely with samples from subjects in the expansion cohorts. 
As of the data cutoff date (20 November 2015), samples for evaluation of HAHA response were available 
for 1298 of 1437 subjects. Across all expansion cohorts, 7 of 1218 subjects (0.6 %) were positive at 
Baseline for  HAHA. Of these pre-existing positive subjects, none  had titer increases ≥ 8 × relative to 
Baseline  (ie,  treatment-boosted)  after  treatment  with  avelumab.  The  table  below  reports  the  HAHA 
incidence. 
Table 12: 
Human anti-human antibody: the incidence and percentage - expansion cohort 
safety analysis set 
Across all expansion cohorts, 46 of 1291 subjects (3.6 %) who were not positive for HAHA at Baseline had 
subsequent  positive  HAHA  results  after  treatment  with  avelumab.  The  persistent  treatment-emergent 
antibody  incidence  was  30  of  1291  subjects  (2.3  %),  with  persistent  defined  as  treatment  emergent 
subjects with duration between first and last positive result ≥ 16 weeks or a positive evaluation at the last 
assessment  
For study EMR100070-003, immunogenicity of avelumab was correlated to exposure in subjects with MCC 
and as exploratory objectives was also correlated to the immunogenicity of avelumab with clinical results 
(ORR and adverse events [AEs]). Subjects were categorised as either never positive or ever positive (a 
positive result at any time point, including Baseline). 
Among  the  88  subjects  with  at  least  one  HAHA  sample  available,  3  subjects  were  regarded  as  ever 
positive with HAHA status. Although no within-subject change on PK was observed in the subjects after 
positive HAHA results, no firm conclusion can be drawn given the small incidence of seroconversion.

In  study  EMR100070-002,  conducted  in  Japanese  patients,  samples  for  evaluation  of  HAHA  response 
were available for 17 subjects from the dose-escalation cohorts.  
In  the  dose-escalation  cohorts,  none  of  the  17  subjects  were  positive  at  baseline  for  HAHA.  In  the 
dose-escalation cohorts, a total of 1/17 (5.9%) subjects who were not positive for HAHA at baseline had 
subsequent positive HAHA results after treatment with avelumab; 1/5 (20.0%) subjects receiving 3.0 
mg/kg dose and no HAHA positives at higher doses. The treatment-emergent response was persistent.  
As part of the Population PK analysis, the influences of occurrence of an immunogenicity (HAHA) has been 
analysed and the results are showed below: 
Figure 14: 
Simulated exposure parameters by occurence of immunogenicity 
The small observed changes in AUCss are consistent with that an influence of immunogenicity (ever 
HAHA) was only detected for V2 in the final population PK model. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Avelumab is expected to be distributed in the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent in the 
extracellular space. The volume of distribution at steady state was 4.72 L. The volume of distribution was 
low and it is in line with the expected for an IgG antibody i.e. mainly restrained to the systemic circulation. 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of avelumab at steady 
state is small. As expected for an antibody, avelumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific 
manner. 
The excretion and metabolism of avelumab has not been studied and no studies are required as an IgG 
antibody is degraded by proteolytic catabolism.  Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis from 
1,629 patients, the value of total systemic clearance (CL) is 0.59 L/day. In the supplemental analysis, 
avelumab CL was found to decrease over time: the largest mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of 
variation [CV%]) from baseline value with different tumour types was approximately 32.1% (CV 36.2%). 
Steady-state concentrations of avelumab were reached after approximately 4 to 6 weeks (2 to 3 cycles) 
of repeated dosing at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was approximately 1.25-fold. 
The elimination half-life (t½) at the recommended dose is 6.1 days based on the population PK analysis. 
The exposure of avelumab increased dose-proportionally in the dose range of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks. The more than proportionally increase of exposure for doses between 1 to 10 mg/kg is 
likely due to the presence of target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) at the lower dose levels. This is not 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 43/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
considered to be clinically relevant. Based on non-compartmental analysis the exposure was dose 
proportional at the proposed therapeutic dose level 10 mg/kg and above.  
The PopPK model appears reasonable for describing the PK of an IgG based mAb. A population 
pharmacokinetic analysis suggested no difference in the total systemic clearance of avelumab based on 
age, gender, race, PD-L1 status, tumour burden, renal impairment and mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment.  Clearance was shown to correlate to body weight and serum albumin,  which is similar 
compared to other mAbs. Total systemic clearance increases with body weight. Steady-state exposure 
was approximately uniform over a wide range of body weights (30 to 204 kg) for body weight normalised 
dosing.  Also, modeling showed that clearance is time dependent but that an empirical function with time 
after first dose as the covariate was a better descriptor than tumour burden.  
Body weight was identified to be a significant covariate for both CL and V1. Avelumab is intended to be 
administered with weight based dosing regimen at 10 mg/kg leading to that high-weight subjects are 
predicted to be slightly over-exposed relative to the general population and the opposite, slightly 
under-exposure for low-weight subjects. This is acceptable as the effect is limited and all clinical studies 
have been performed using weight-based dosing. 
No influence of age on avelumab CL was observed in the range 20-91 years (n=1629 and geometric mean 
63 years). 
Race was identified to be a statistically significant covariate on CL in Black or African American race. 
However, the influence on exposure appear to be minor and not considered clinically meaningful, thus no 
dose adjustment is needed based on race. 
Gender was identified to be a statistically significant covariate on both CL and V1 after accounting for 
weight, both being higher in male subjects. However, the influence on exposure appears to be minor and 
not considered clinically meaningful, thus no dose adjustment is needed based on gender. 
No dedicated study in special population has been conducted. However, different demographic and 
pathophysiological covariates were evaluated in the population PK analysis to assess any influence on 
avelumab PK.  Overall, no covariate effect in the special populations caused more than 20% change in 
exposure from the typical patient. No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
No formal study has been performed in renal or hepatic impaired patients, however it was evaluated in 
the PopPK analysis. This is acceptable as avelumab is an antibody and renal or hepatic impairment is not 
expected to influence the PK of avelumab.  
To assess the influence of renal function on avelumab PK the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, 
mL/min/1.73 m2) was calculated according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. 
Data included 671 patients with normal renal function (CRCL ≥90 mL/min), 623 with mild renal 
impairment (RI, CRCL ≥60 and <90 mL/min), 320 with moderate RI (≥30 and <60 mL/min) and 4 with 
severe RI CRCL (<30 mL/min).  The PopPK analysis did not detect any relation between clearance of 
avelumab and renal function. No clinically important differences in the clearance of avelumab were found 
between patients with mild (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 60 to 89 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault Creatinine 
Clearance (CrCL); n=623), moderate (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min, n=320) and patients with normal (GFR 
≥ 90 mL/min, n=671) renal function. Avelumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min). Of note only 4 patients were categorised as having severe RI and no 
firm conclusion can be drawn in this group. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed for patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). There are insufficient data in patients with severe 
renal impairment for dosing recommendations.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 44/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
No clinically important differences in the clearance of avelumab were found between patients with mild 
hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 times ULN, n=217) and 
normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, n=1,388) in a population PK analysis. Hepatic 
impairment was defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria of hepatic dysfunction. Avelumab has 
not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin between 1.5 and 3 times ULN) 
or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 times ULN). In patients with mild hepatic impairment (n=217, 
defined as (BILI≤ULN and AST>ULN) or (BILI>1*ULN and BILI≤1.5 *ULN and any AST) data indicated that 
no dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  Very few 
subjects were available in moderate HI patients (n=4) and severe HI (n=1) and thus there are insufficient 
data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
No interaction studies or studies with biomaterials have been conducted with avelumab. Avelumab is 
primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways, therefore, it is not expected that avelumab will have 
pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with other medicinal products. 
The bioassays have in general been correctly validated. Several concerns were raised to account for 
possible underestimation of avelumab immunogenicity, with emphasis on assay cut-point determination 
(report TNJS13-170 and TNJS13-170A1, report TNJS15-062) and drug tolerance (report IP190 and 
IP373, report TNJS15-062). Finally, a solid tumour (ST) population cut point factor of 1.25 was identified 
and provided adequate assay sensitivity and drug tolerance level. With the updated cut point factor the 
number of subjects classified as ADA ever-positive and as ADA treatment-emergent were estimated to be 
6.2% and 5.9%, respectively (data from the integrated safety summary, i.e. study EMR100070-001 and 
Study EMR100070-003 Part A; n=1738). There seemed to be a potential increased risk for 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in ADA ever-positive subjects versus ADA ever-negative subjects: the 
incidence of IRRs was about 40% and 25% in ADA ever-positive patients and ADA never-positive 
patients, respectively. It was also noted that a numerically higher percentage of ADA ever-positive 
subjects had serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation as compared to 
ADA never-positive subjects. But the interpretation of the data is limited by the low incidence and the 
confounding effect of increasing number of ever-positive subjects with time and the similarly increased 
risk for TEAEs. This data has been adequately described in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Immunogenicity and 
severe infusion-related reactions (grade ≥3) are also included in the RMP as an Important potential risk 
and Important identified risk, respectively. 
The applicant’s neutralising antibody (nAb) assay is considered inadequate, and the data on nAb positive 
subjects is therefore not reliable. As avelumab is a human immunoglobulin, it is expected that the 
propensity of patients to develop neutralising antibodies against avelumab is very low. Nevertheless, the 
applicant is strongly encouraged to improve their assay in terms of appropriate drug tolerance level 
compared to the avelumab Ctrough values.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology for avelumab has overall been adequately characterised. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
The current neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay is not considered adequate in terms of the assay’s 
drug tolerance, i.e. there is a concern that the sensitivity of the assay cannot be ensured at the 
Ctrough levels of avelumab. The Applicant is therefore recommended to develop a method 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 45/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
suitable to detect nAb in patients and, if possible, submit a re-analysis of the potential impact of 
nAb on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety. 
The drug tolerance of the neutralizing antibody assay may be underestimated due to use of a 
polyclonal positive control. The applicant should evaluate feasibility to improve drug tolerance, 
including additional methodology for identification of a monoclonal positive control. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose justification 
The dose selected for the pivotal Study, EMR100070-003, was based on adequate safety and tolerability 
in Phase 1 Study EMR100070-001, a phase I study which enrolled adult subjects with metastatic or locally 
advanced solid tumors and expansion to selected indications (1490 enrolled as of 20 November 2015). 
The study included a dose escalation phase administered via iv infusion once every 2 weeks (dose 
escalation phase: 1.0 mg/kg (n = 4), 3.0 mg/kg (n =13), 10.0 mg/kg (n =15), 20.0 mg/kg (n =21); 
Treatment expansion phase: 10.0 mg/kg (n=1437)). Pharmacokinetic half-life was seen to increase with 
increasing doses indicating non-linear drug disposition. The 10 mg/kg dose once every 2 weeks achieved 
the high target occupancy (mean TO >90%) of PD-L1 in PBMC during the whole dose interval as 
determined from ex vivo studies. Based on the in vitro TO data and the observed trough serum avelumab 
levels, TO was predicted to reach or exceed 95% throughout the entire dosing interval for more subjects 
in 10 mg/kg dose group than those in 3 mg/kg dose group from the dose escalation cohorts of Study 
EMR100070-001.

events) was allowed while on study 
•  Active CNS metastases (allowed if treated, fully recovered from treatment, not progressing for at 
least 2 months and not requiring steroids) 
Previous malignant disease within the last 5 years  
Prior organ transplantation, including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation 
•

•  Active or history of any autoimmune disease (except for subjects with vitiligo) or immunodeficiencies 
that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive drugs 
•  Clinically  significant  cardiovascular  disease  and  all  other  significant  diseases  which  might  have

Treatments 
All patients received avelumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, as an IV infusion over approximately 1 
hour.  
Premedication with paracetamol and antihistamine, 30-60 minutes before avelumab infusion, was 
mandatory.  
Subjects were treated until significant clinical deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent 
or any other criterion for withdrawal as per protocol. Treatment beyond radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 was 
allowed providing there was no significant clinical deterioration and if, in the opinion of investigator, the 
subject would benefit from continued treatment. Confirmation of PD by imaging was required, preferably 
6 weeks (but no later) after progression has been diagnosed according to RECIST 1.1, before stopping 
treatment. Treatment during the confirmation period should continue as scheduled, despite a first 
observation of progression according to RECIST 1.1, until confirmation has been made, and further if 
there is no significant clinical deterioration. 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 47/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Subjects who experienced a confirmed CR as reported by the Investigator could be treated for 6 to 12 
months after confirmation, at the discretion of the Investigator, or beyond 12 months after discussion 
with the Sponsor. In case a subject with a confirmed CR relapsed after stopping treatment, but prior to 
the end of the study, one re-initiation of treatment was allowed, providing there were no prior toxicities 
leading to discontinuation of avelumab.  
For the purpose of subject management, assessments were made by the Investigators, but the primary 
and secondary endpoint determinations were supported by tumour assessments performed by an 
Independent Endpoint Review Committee (IERC). The tumour imaging assessment was performed at 
baseline, at week 7, then every 6 weeks afterwards. Confirmation of response (CR, PR) was required 
(preferably at the regularly scheduled 6-week assessment interval, but no sooner than 5 weeks after the 
initial documentation of response).

description  of  the  effects  of  avelumab  treatment  as  perceived  and  reported  by  subjects  with 
metastatic MCC 
Sample size 
The planned total sample size was 84 subjects. The trial aims at demonstrating an ORR greater than 20% 
by means of an exact binomial test, based on the following assumptions: 1) an ORR of 35%; 2) an overall 
alpha = 0.025 (1-sided) for the test of the null hypothesis of an ORR ≤ 20%.  
The planned enrollment was 84 patients, however, an additional 4 were enrolled since they were in the 
screening window at the time the decision was made to halt. 
The study was designed to have an interim analysis for futility after 20 subjects were enrolled and 
observed for at least 3 months and an interim analysis for efficacy 6 months after 56 subjects were 
enrolled. 
Applicant’s justification of the assumption of a response rate of 35% to define the trial sample size: 
anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated antitumor activity in tumours whose 
micro-environment express PD-L1 (data from International Association for Study of Lung Cancer annual 
meeting in 2013). Robust expression of PD-L1 in the immune-infiltrating cells of MCC has been reported 
in the literature (Lipson, 2013) and confirmed by the Sponsor. On these grounds, the expression of PD-L1 
by the immune infiltrating cells as well as the expression of PD-L1 at the surface of MCC constitute a very 
strong rationale for the evaluation of avelumab in that disease. A response rate of approximately 20% has 
been reported in several tumour types where only a fraction of the tumours express PD-L1 at the surface 
of the tumours or at the surface of immune infiltrating cells. 
Randomisation 
This is a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
A two-stage group sequential testing approach was applied for efficacy. The null hypothesis could be 
rejected if 20 subjects in the interim analysis after 56 subjects, or 26 subjects in the primary analysis after 
88 subjects, showed a confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1. The corresponding nominal p-values 
of the exact binomial test were 0.0045 and 0.0211, respectively. The resulting overall probability of 
reaching a positive result in the interim or primary analysis under the null hypothesis assumption of an 
ORR ≤ 20% was ≤ 0.0223, as derived from the binomial distribution according to Jennison and Turnbull. 
The overall type I error rate is controlled at a level of 2.5% (one-sided). 
Objective response rate was reported with corresponding two-sided Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals 
(CI). A repeated CI according to Jennison for the ORR (95.9% CI for the primary analysis) was calculated 
to account for the group sequential testing approach (i.e., interim analysis and primary analysis). 
Response status at 6 and 12 months was analysed by calculating the proportion of subjects in response 
at 6 (12) months among all subjects who started study treatment at least 6 (12) months prior to the 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 50/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
cut-off date, respectively. Time-to event endpoints (duration of response, progression-free survival, and 
overall survival) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methodology; median values were calculated with 
corresponding CI using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. To compare PFS time on treatment with 
avelumab to time to progression (TTP) on the last prior anticancer therapy, the hazard ratio (including 
95% CI) of avelumab treatment to the last prior anticancer therapy was calculated using a shared frailty 
model with a gamma distribution of the frailty term.  In a post-hoc analysis, the 6-months DRR was 
estimated as the product of the ORR and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6-months durability of response. 
An asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) for the DRR was obtained by applying the standard formula 
for the variance of a product of independent random variables, using Greenwood’s formula for the 
variance of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 6-month durability. 
Descriptive statistics for the absolute EQ-5D and FACT-M scores were summarized at baseline and at all 
scheduled requests to fill out questionnaires during the study. Changes in EQ-5D and FACT-M scores from 
baseline were summarized. The association between tumour size changes and HRQoL score changes from 
baseline was assessed by simple linear regression of time-matched values, with absolute change from 
baseline in HRQoL scores as the dependent variable and relative change in tumour size from baseline at 
the same time point as the predictor. 
Since the study is not powered for any subgroup analysis, all the subgroup analysis are exploratory in 
nature. 
The following sequence of analyses was planned: 
• 
• 
• 
Interim futility analysis: was performed 3 months after start of study treatment of the 20th 
subject. Only the first 20 subjects at the clinical cut-off date were included in the primary 
endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoint analysis; and all subjects who received at least one 
dose of treatment up to the cut-off date were included in analysis of safety. 
Interim efficacy analysis: was performed 6 months after start of study treatment of the 56th 
subject. The analysis was performed on the ITT population and included subjects with minimum 
follow up of 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks beyond day 1. 
The primary analysis: was performed 6 months after start of study treatment of the last subject 
enrolled in the trial. The primary analysis was performed on the ITT population. 
•  An exploratory analysis will be conducted 12 months after the accrual of the last subject. 
The confirmatory statistical test for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis included procedures for 
controlling the overall type I error rate at level of 2.5% one-sided. All other statistical analyses performed 
on the secondary and other endpoints were exploratory. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
used, if not otherwise specified. 
Censoring rules applied in the analysis are presented in the table below: 
Endpoint 
Censoring rules 
DOR 
PFS 
For subjects with a confirmed response but neither documented disease progression nor death 
within 12 weeks after the last tumor assessment, as of the cut-off date for the analysis, the 
duration of response will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment. 
For subjects with both the baseline tumor assessment and at least one adequate tumor 
assessment after start of treatment, the general censoring rules apply: 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 51/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
For subjects with no tumor assessment at baseline or no tumor response assessment 
post-baseline, the special censoring rules apply (and overrule the general censoring rules): 
OS 
For subjects who are still alive at the time of data analysis or who are lost to follow up, OS time 
will be censored at the last recorded date that the subject is known to be alive (date of last 
contact, last visit date, date of last trial treatment administration or date of last scan, whichever 
is the latest) as of the data cut-off date for the analysis.

Recruitment 
Study period was from 3rd July 2014 (consent date of first enrolled subject) to 3rd March 2016 (data cut-off 
for the primary analysis, corresponding to 6 months after start of study treatment of the last subject).  
Estimated median duration of follow-up for PFS according to IERC assessment in the ITT Analysis Set 
(exploratory endpoint), calculated by applying reverse censoring rules, was 10.1 months (95% CI: 8.3, 
11.1; range: 0.3, 18.8). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 SAP versions. The analyses were carried out according to the SAP Version 3.0 dated 31 
March 2016. The changes from the planned analyses are summarized below:  
−  The  on-treatment  period  was  changed  from  +  29  days  to  +  30  days  from  first  study  drug 
administration.  
−  The  planned  sample  size  as  specified  in  the  clinical  study  protocol  was  84  subjects.  The  actual 
enrolment was 88 subjects, all receiving at least 1 dose of study drug; therefore all 88 subjects are 
included in the primary analysis. Critical values for statistical testing in the primary analysis were 
adjusted  
−  Subgroup  analysis  according  to  the  SAP  was  to  include  “number  of  prior  systemic  therapies  for 
metastatic  disease  or  locally  advanced  therapies”,  classified  as  1  or  ≥2;  however,  analyses  were 
performed according to “Number of prior systemic therapies,” classified as 1 or ≥2” and “number of 
prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease” classified as 1 or ≥2 
−  The  subgroup  for  visceral  metastases  at  Baseline  was  based  on  IERC  assessment,  as  opposed  to 
Investigator assessment, as specified in Section 10 of SAP v3.0. Furthermore, lesions recorded as 
having a site of ‘SKIN’, ‘SOFTTISSUES’ or ‘EYE’ were classified as skin lesions, and only lesions with 
a  categorization  of  neither  skin  (‘SKIN’  /  ‘SOFTTISSUES’  /‘EYE’)  nor  lymph  node  lesion  were 
considered as visceral lesions 
Protocol amendments 1, 2 and 2.1 were made before starting of enrolment in July 2014. Part B of the 
study, enrolling patients who had not received any prior systemic treatment for metastatic MCC, was 
added with Amendment 7. 
Protocol deviations:  
A total of 12/88 (13.6%) subjects in the ITT analysis set were reported with 1 or more important protocol 
deviation: 
−  5 patients were enrolled although ineligible (1 subject had prior therapy with antibody targeting T-cell 
co-regulatory  proteins  [4-1BB  agonist],  1  subject  had  a  previous  malignancy  within  5  years,  2 
subjects had lymphocytes below the required level at screening, 1 subject was found to have brain 
metastases)   
−  5 subjects took prohibited medications (steroids used not to treat irAEs) 
−  3 subjects did not receive premedication 
Minor deviations were mainly related to laboratory assessment (e.g. missing tests), visit schedule (e.g. 
out of planned range) and study procedure (e.g. ECG not performed).

Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis was conducted 6 months after the accrual of the last subject. An exploratory 
analysis was conducted 12 months after the accrual of the last subject. 
Subject follow-up for progression and survival will continue until 1 year after the last subject receives the 
last dose of avelumab.

Efficacy analyses were based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set. The ITT population is including all 
88 enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
The PP population is made by 64 patients and it has been used for sensitivity analyses for efficacy 
endpoints. The Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set and includes all ITT 
subjects who meet all of the following criteria: 
• Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 and IERC assessment 
• Distant metastatic disease 
• Histologically proven MCC with confirmation of the diagnosis by immuno-histochemistry detection of 
CK20  (or  other  appropriate  cytokeratin  expression  such  as  pancytokeratin,  AE1/AE3,  or  Cam5.2) 
according to the assessment documented in the “Disease History” eCRF page 
•  Have  progressed  after  1  line  of  chemotherapy  that  was  administered  for  the  treatment  of  distant 
metastatic MCC as defined in Section 5.3.1 Inclusion Criteria in the protocol 
•  Evaluable  patients,  defined  as  having  at  least one post-baseline tumor  assessment  with  absence  of 
non-assessable status 
Outcomes and estimation 
At the time of the data cut-off, 26 subjects (29.5%) were continuing on active treatment, 62 patients 
discontinued treatment; among them, 15 were still in follow-up at the cut-off date and 43 had died.

Updated DoR Results from the 12-months Follow-up Analysis of Subjects with Previously Treated mMCC 
from Study EMR100070-003 Part A 
In the 12-months minimum follow-up analysis, the longest response durations included 1 subject with a 
CR lasting 23.3+ months and 3 subjects with CR (n=2) or PR (n=1) lasting 18.0+ months, all of which 
were still ongoing at the last tumor assessment. In this more mature dataset, the median duration of 
response still has not been reached (95% CI: 18.0 months, not estimable), which provides evidence that 
responses to avelumab are durable (see Table 21 and see Figure 15 below with duration of response 
reported).

Health-related QoL 
a)  EQ-5D VAS and index scores, ITT 
Table 25:  
EQ-5D VAS and index scores, ITT analysis set – Study EMR100070-003  
Patient attrition can be observed from baseline to EOT. The results are relatively stable, with a slight tend 
towards lower scores at EOT.  
b)  Functional assessment of cancer therapy-melanoma (FACT-M) 
Low score changes were observed patients beyond week 13; however, EOT results indicate a slight 
worsening, with a median score change for the FACT-M Total score of -9.3. 
The health-related quality of life ED-5D and FACT-M do not contribute with definitive information 
regarding avelumab treatment. As for the semi-structured interviews, 10 patients responded at baseline 
as well as at weeks 13 and 17.

Durable response (defined as response for ≥6 months) 
Table 27:  
Durable response rate, proportion of subjects with at least 6 months durable 
response 
Seven patients had not yet reached the 6 months in response at the time of cutoff, so DRR may change. 
In the primary analysis, the DRR in the ITT population was 29%, while in the PP was 37%. 
In the 12 months’ analysis, 25 patients (28.4%) have been reported with a durable response as of the 
data cutoff. Two patients, still on study as of cut-off date had a DOR censored at a value < 6 months due 
to limited follow-up (possibly because subsequent tumor assessment was not evaluable).  
PD-L1 expression 
Predictive value of PD-L1 expression in terms of objective response rate (ORR) was evaluated at various 
cut-offs that were specified in the SAP. Four definitions for PD-L1 positivity were specified as follows: 
•  ≥ 1% positive tumour cell staining at any staining intensity 
•  ≥ 5% positive tumour cell staining at any staining intensity 
•  ≥ 25% positive tumour cell staining with at least 2+ staining intensity 
• 
“PD-L1 hotspots” with ≥ 10% PD-L1 expressing immune cells

Study  EMR100070-003  Part  B:  Results  of  Treatment-naïve  Patients  with  metastatic  Merkel 
cell carcinoma (mMCC) 
For Part B, an interim analysis of efficacy was conducted with 39 patients who received at least one dose. 
Of those, 30 (77%) were males, the median age was 75 years (range: 47 years to 88 years), 33 (85%) 
patients were Caucasian, and 31 (79%) patients and 8 (21%) patients had an ECOG performance status 
0 and 1, respectively. Twenty-nine patients had at least 13 weeks of follow-up at the time of the data 
cut-off (24 March 2017).  Results are shown in Table 33.  
Table 33:  
Best overall response (BOR) according to IERC assessment in treatment- 
naive subjects with mMCC - Full analysis set - Study EMR100070-003 Part B 
Among the 39 subjects included in the interim analysis of Part B of study EMR100070-003, there are 29 
subjects who were followed for a minimum of 13 weeks. Among these 29 treatment naïve subjects, an 
objective response rate (ORR) of 62.1% (95% CI: 42.3, 79.3) was reported. Per the IERC, there were 18

subjects with confirmed responses, including 4 subjects with a complete response (CR) and 14 subjects 
with a partial response (PR).  
Among the 29 patients followed for a minimum of 13 weeks, 14 confirmed responses were ongoing at the 
time of the data cut-off, with a median duration that could not be estimated (95% CI for DOR: (4.0, -), 
min 1.2+, max 8.3+). Among treatment-naïve subjects in Part B, there were 6 responses with a duration 
of at least 6 months as of the cut-off in March 2017, 5 of which were ongoing at the cut-off date (see 
Figure 25).

Investigators/Study Centers: 
Part A: US Oncology Network (USON) outpatient medical oncology practices across the United States 
(US) (19 states) 
Part B: MCC Registry with 56 clinical sites (Germany - 53, Austria - 2, and Switzerland - 1) 
Study Period (years): 
Part A: November 2004 – June 2015 
Part B: November 2004 – December 2015 
Objectives: 
Part A: The primary objective was to assess objective response rate (ORR) based on best overall response 
(BOR) to the index (second line [2L] or later) chemotherapy treatment; BOR used 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as a guide. The secondary objectives included 
the following: 
• 
• 
• 
To assess duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival 
(OS), time to treatment discontinuation (TTD), and durable response rate (DRR) to the 
index (2L or later) chemotherapy treatment 
To assess the above objectives in the first line (1L) chemotherapy treatment populations 
(1L cohorts) based on the 1L treatment. 
Part B: The primary objective was to assess ORR based on BOR to the index (2L or later) 
chemotherapy treatment; BOR was described based on data provided by the physician based on 
best clinical judgment. In Part B, the secondary objectives were identical to those in Part A, with 
2 key differences. 
•  BOR was described based on data provided by the physician based on best clinical judgment 
rather than RECIST criteria 
•  As only patients treated with 2L chemotherapy were available in Part B, 1L treatment outcomes 
would be presented among those patients that received 2L chemotherapy treatment, not among 
patients that may have received 1L chemotherapy but not 2L. 
For both Part A and Part B, all the objectives were evaluated among immunocompetent patients as the 
primary analysis as well as all patients meeting the study criteria (all qualified patients). 
This was a retrospective, observational, descriptive study. 
Number of Subjects: 
Part A: Twenty qualified patients, including 14 immunocompetent patients, were identified who received 
2L or later chemotherapy. A total of 67 qualified patients, including 51 immunocompetent patients, were 
identified who received 1L chemotherapy. 
Part B: Overall, 34 qualified patients, including 29 immunocompetent patients, with distant mMCC were 
identified who received 2L or later chemotherapy. In addition, 32 patients, including 
28 immunocompetent patients, were identified who received 1L chemotherapy among the patients that 
had received 2L or later chemotherapy.

Criteria for Evaluation: 
Efficacy: The primary endpoint was the patients’ BOR to their line of systemic chemotherapy. 
Other efficacy endpoints included DOR, durable response, TTD, PFS, and OS. All endpoints were 
calculated for patients with 2L or later chemotherapy and for the 1L chemotherapy populations. 
The primary analysis population was the immunocompetent patients. All analyses were also conducted for 
all qualified patients. 
Safety: Safety was not assessed in this study. 
Statistical Methods: 
Descriptive statistics were provided. Results were reported in aggregate. The number and percent of 
patients along with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, 25th and 75th 
percentiles, and number of missing values) were reported for continuous data. Categorical variables 
(e.g., age groups, race) were reported with the number and percent of patients. Counts of missing 
observations were provided. Descriptive analyses were conducted for demographic characteristics, 
selected clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome. 
Outcome analyses were performed among all immunocompetent patients as well as in the overall study 
population. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the 1L chemotherapy treated population. 
For the primary analysis, ORR described the proportion of immunocompetent patients with CR or PR 
among all immunocompetent patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was used for time to event endpoints.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant submitted the results of a single-arm phase II study EMR100070-003 Part A, in 2nd + line 
metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) patients who progressed after the most recent regimen, as well 
as interim results from study EMR100070-003 Part B to include treatment-naïve mMCC patients. 
The design of the study was discussed at the SAWP and the advice was generally followed.  The study 
design as a single arm study with patients that had been pre-treated with chemotherapy as standard of 
care was considered appropriate and  acceptable. It had also been agreed that a randomised clinical trial 
was not feasible as the confirmatory trial for the conditional MA since this is an orphan condition and 
pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) had shown efficacy in mMCC. Hence,  a single arm study in naive patients was 
considered appropriate as the basis for the fulfilment of the conditional MA. The inclusion-exclusion 
criteria are considered acceptable as they reflect the patient population with metastatic disease. The 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 85/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
primary endpoint (ORR) as well as secondary endpoint (DoR, PFS and OS) were also considered 
acceptable considering that MCC is a rare tumour and there are few patients that can be recruited in order 
to appropriately power a randomised controlled trial with the conventional endpoints of PFS and OS. 
Patients with active or a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; active or a history of 
autoimmune disease; a history of other malignancies within the last 5 years; organ transplant; conditions 
requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C were excluded 
(SmPC section 4.4 and 5.1). Therefore, patients with autoimmune disease, HIV, Hepatitis B or C and with 
organ transplants have included in the RMP as missing information. As many patients that are 
immunocompromised have a higher risk for mMCC, efficacy data in mMCC patients that are 
immunocompromised will be collected during the conduct of the PASS study as well as in early access 
programmes. 
As the study did not have a control arm, Study 100070OBS-001 was a multicenter, multi-country, 
retrospective, observational study that was performed to collect response information available for both 
1L therapy and 2L+ therapy. The retrospective observational study was intended to address a lack of 
information on reliable historical data and also the lack of a comparator arm in the Phase II trial 
EMR100070-003. The purpose of the observational study was to generate data on observed clinical 
outcomes of patients with metastatic MCC who have progressed after one line of chemotherapy in current 
clinical practice. The cohort was similar to the patient population in EMR100070-003 study.  Part A of the 
study was conducted in the US focusing on patients in community oncology settings to reflect real-world 
care in the US, which was primarily in an academic setting in the US. The observational study Part B was 
conducted in Europe, in the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland (DACH) 
among patients in academic centers that are part of a common MCC Registry for the DACH. In addition, 
the data was supplemented with recent literature citing response rates and duration of response for 
subjects with distant metastatic MCC (Stage IV) in the 1L and 2L chemotherapy disease settings. Taking 
into account the caveats with registries and observational studies, the data can only be considered as 
supportive as there were divergences observed in terms of objective response rates in the registry study 
and in published clinical experience in first line treatment. Combined with an ultra-orphan disease with no 
approved therapy or consensus guideline on the most appropriate chemotherapy, the observational 
results cannot be used as intended by the advice, which required good quality comparative controls and 
a compelling difference between a comparative analysis of the the clinical effect observed in the 
chemotherapy group vs avelumab treated patients that would be indisputably positive.  The limited data 
showed marked geographic differences reflective of the lack of consensus regarding therapy.  
Nevertheless, baseline characteristics and demographics for both Part A and Part B showed that the 
majority of patients recruited were male with an average age of 73 years and 64 years old respectively. 
The majority of patients had an ECOG 0-1 for Part A whereas no information was given for Past B. Most 
patients also had visceral disease for both Part A and B. There were fewer patients recruited with stage IV 
for Part A than for Part B.  The majority of patients with 1L chemotherapy were Stage I, II, or III at initial 
MCC diagnosis. The mean (SD) duration of 1L chemotherapy was 90.8 (75.6) days and 91.8 (69.8) days 
in immunocompetent and qualified patients, respectively. 
The avelumab dose was 10 mg/kg q2w and was based on studies demonstrating optimal receptor 
occupancy in the dose escalation studies. Administration of Bavencio should continue according to the 
recommended schedule until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with radiological 
disease progression not associated with significant clinical deterioration, defined as no new or worsening 
symptoms, no change in performance status for greater than two weeks, and no need for salvage 
therapy, could continue treatment.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patients who have progressed after receiving at least 1 line of previous chemotherapy for the treatment 
of mMCC  
Updated results with 12 month minimum follow-up data from the Part A cohort of 88 subjects with 
treatment experienced mMCC subjects, demonstrated an ORR of 33% (95% CI: 23.3, 43.8) with CR in 
10/88 and PR in 19/88 individuals compared to 31.8% (95% CI: 22.3, 42.6) previously reported with the 
6-months minimum follow-up (primary) analysis.  
The durable response rate defined as duration of response 6 months or more was 31% and PFS rate at 12 
months was 30% (95% CI 21; 41%). Median DOR was not reached (95%CI 18.0, NE). In the 12-months 
minimum follow-up analysis, the longest response durations included 1 subject with a CR lasting 23.3+ 
months and 3 subjects with CR (n=2) or PR (n=1) lasting 18.0+ months, all of which were still ongoing at 
the last tumour assessment. The estimated median PFS time was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.4, 6.9), with a 
6-month PFS rate of 40% (95% CI: 29, 50), and 12-month and 15-month PFS rates of 30% (95% CI: 21, 
41) each. Although ORR is not very impressive, the duration of response is considered clinically relevant 
advantage over chemotherapy.  The duration of response with avelumab therapy in 2L+ is favourable 
when placed in context with chemotherapy. Specifically, subjects treated with avelumab in the 2L+ 
setting, had a median duration of response that was not yet reached and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 
18.0 months, while the median duration of response for 1L chemotherapy was 6.7 months with an upper 
bound of 10.5 months for the 95% CI in Part A of Study 100070-Obs001 (1L) and a median duration of 
response as 2.8 months in Iyer et al. This difference in median duration of response between 2L+ 
avelumab treatment and chemotherapy in the 1L setting, suggests that avelumab treatment in subjects 
with mMCC may lead to durable responses regardless of line of therapy. 
In the updated analysis conducted 12 months after the accrual of the last subject, there were 3 additional 
PFS events (all progression of disease), compared to the primary analysis at 6-months minimum 
follow-up (52 events [59.1%] vs. 55 events [62.5%]). An apparent plateau of the Kaplan-Meier PFS 
curve, observed in the 6-months analysis, is maintained in the updated 12-months analysis, possibly 
reflecting the proportion of subjects with durable responses.  
Compared to chemotherapy in 2L+, while the median PFS is numerically similar (2.7 months), long-term 
PFS rates exceed results with 2L chemotherapy. Indeed, PFS rates with avelumab 2L+ was 40%, 30% 
and 30% at 6, 12 and 15 months respectively, while it was between 0 and 13% at 6 months, and 0% at 
12 and 15 months with chemotherapy. 
Compared to chemotherapy in 1L, PFS rates at 6, 12 and 15 months are overall similar to Obs-001 study 
results. Literature 1L data from Iyer 2016 showed PFS rates lower compared to the Obs-001 study. 
Median OS with avelumab 2L+ is 12.9 months (95% CI: 7.5, NE), similar to mOS of chemotherapy 1L 
(10.5 months [95%CI 7.2, 10.2] in immunocompetent patients Part A Obs-001). Overall, the long-term 
benefit with avelumab in pre-treated patients appeared not inferior to the outcome of chemotherapy in 
treatment-naïve patients.  
There is a lack of data on patients with active central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, active or with a 
history of any autoimmune disease, a history of other malignancies within the last 5 years, organ 
transplant, conditions requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection with HIV or hepatitis 
B or C, as these patients were excluded from the clinical trial (this is reflected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC). Hence, in the absence of clinical efficacy data, avelumab should be used with caution in these 
populations after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis.

In Part B, meaningful data are only available in a small number of patients (35) with limited follow-up 
(≥6 weeks). The unconfirmed ORR was 60%. Altogether 39 patients were enrolled thereof 29 with a 
minimum of 13 weeks follow-up. The overall confirmed ORR was 62% (95% CI 42; 79) and the proportion 
of patients with at least 6 months durability of response was 83% (95% CI 46; 96). The study is ongoing 
with planned enrolment of 112 subjects.  The interim data from Part B provides initial evidence of durable 
response with 14 of 18 responders with at least 13 weeks of follow-up still reporting ongoing responses at 
the time of database cut-off. As further replication for the data showing in Part A, there was, in Part B, a 
rapid onset of responses with 16 of 18 confirmed responses reported at the first visit occurring 
approximately 6 weeks after initiation of study drug treatment in the analysis set of subjects with at least 
13 weeks of follow-up. This rapid onset of response in treatment naïve subjects is similar to the timing of 
response to avelumab observed in treatment experienced subjects from Part A. Finally, among these 
responders, 6 subjects reported to have duration of response ≥ 6 months, of which 5 were continuing at 
the time of the data cutoff. Confirmed ORR in the 14 patients followed for a minimum of 6 months was 
71.4% (95%CI 41.9-91.6) with 10 confirmed responses (4 CR and 6 PR).  
Among the 29 patients followed for a minimum of 13 weeks, 14 confirmed responses were ongoing at the 
time of the data cut-off, with the median and 95% CI DOR that could not be estimated (95% CI for DOR: 
(4.0, -), min 1.2+, max 8.3+). Median duration of response from the interim analysis for 1L avelumab 
was not yet estimable.  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Bavencio 
in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
PD-L1 expression and MCV positivity 
Of the total 88 patients, 74 (84%) had tumour samples evaluable for PD-L1 expression. Cut-off used for 
tumour PD-L1 expression were ≥ 1% and ≥ 5% positive tumour cell IHC staining at any staining intensity 
(only 4 samples were positive with a cut-off 25%). The updated 12-months follow up analysis confirmed 
that the PD-L1 positive tumours subgroup achieved overall better ORR and DRR compared to PD-L1 
negative tumour, with a trend toward improved outcome with higher cut-off positivity. Median DOR was 
not reached in all subgroups with the exception of PD-L1 negative at 5% cut-off (median DOR 18.0 
months, 95% CI [18, NE]). The subgroup analysis of PFS and OS favoured PD-L1 positive subjects with 
expression ≥ 1% or ≥ 5%. No conclusion can be drawn on patients with PD-L1 and MCV positivity status 
due to too few patients in each subgroup. In the framework of a rare disease and the lack of an 
appropriate cut-off for PD-L1, it is difficult to implement a selection of patients for avelumab therapy 
based on biomarker in current clinical practice. The clinical utility of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker in 
MCC has not been established. The CHMP recommends taking the opportunity to further study the 
predictive value of PD-L1 and MCV in the ongoing Part B of Study 003 in first line mMCC, if possible, while 
acknowledging the difficulty of obtaining tumour samples from patients in this rare disease.  
Study 100070OBS-001 
For both Part A and Part B, the majority of patients recruited were male with an average age of 73 years 
and 64 years old respectively. The majority of patients had a ECOG 0-1 for Part A whereas no information 
was given for Past B. Most patients also had visceral disease for both Part A and B. For patients being 
treated with 2nd line therapy, ORR was 20.0% (95%CI 5.7, 43.7) and 28.6% (95%CI 8.4, 58.1) for Part 
A and 8.8% (95%CI 1.9, 23.7) and 10.3% (95%CI 2.2, 27.4) for Part B, for all qualified and 
immunocompetent patients, respectively. DOR was found to be similar in the two group, the qualified 
population for Part A had a DOR of 1.7 months (95%CI 0.5, 0.3) and for Part B was 1.9 months (95%CI 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 88/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
1.3, 2.1). In this study, there were no durable responses (> 6 months) to 2L or later chemotherapy, there 
were no complete responders, and the median DOR was < 2 months. In the qualified population, median 
PFS was 2.1 months (95%CI1.0, 3.2) for Part A and 3.0 months (95%CI 2.6, 3.1) for Part B and median 
OS was found to be 4.4 month (95%CI 2.2, 6.2) and 5.3 month (95%CI 4.3, 5.8). Similar results were 
found for immunocompetent patients.  
For patients treated with 1st line chemotherapy, therapy, ORR was 31.3% (95%CI 20.6, 43.8)  and 29.4% 
(95%CI 17.5, 43.8) for Part A only,  for all qualified and immunocompetent patients, respectively. DOR 
was found to be similar between the all qualified and immunocompetent group for Part A with a DOR of 
5.7 months (95%CI 2.6,8.7) and 6.7 months (95%CI 1.2, 10.5). In both groups, median PFS was 4.6 
months (95%CI 3.0, 7.0) and 4.6 months (95%CI 2.8, 7.7) and median OS was found to be 10.2 month 
(95%CI 7.4, 15.2) and 10.5 month (95%CI 7.2, 10.2).  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The CHMP were of the opinion that the preliminary efficacy data presented from Study EMR100070-003 
Part B indicated a clinical benefit to mMCC patients that have not been treated with chemotherapy. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that the conditional marketing authorisation requested by the applicant 
could be granted to an indication covering naïve as well as patients pre-treated with chemotherapy given 
that, although the data in 1st line was promising, the data is limited as few patients have reached the 6 
month milestone and further confirmatory data from additional treated patients would be needed to 
confirm the effect size of the benefit.  As further data is necessary to confirm the efficacy in the indication 
proposed on the basis of the Part B of the study which is ongoing and includes treatment-naïve mMCC 
patients (none enrolled prior to the cut-off date for the primary analysis of Part A, March 2016), the CHMP 
imposes the specific obligation to submit the final study results by January 2020. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results in 2nd line treatment show an ORR of 33% with some patients having durable responses 
resulting in an apparent PFS plateau. The long duration of response and high durable response rate 
observed after 6-month minimum follow-up is further substantiated by the 12-months minimum 
follow-up analysis. The median OS time in the updated results exceeded 1 year. Therefore, the clinical 
benefit in 2nd line treatment is considered clinically meaningful and the magnitude of the effect is 
significant compared to chemotherapy.  
The data provided in 1st line, although preliminary, showed activity of avelumab in mMCC in terms of 
response rate, and evidence of a similar durable response from the small subset of patients with a longer 
follow-up compared to 2nd line treatment.   
Taking into account the intrinsic limitation of single arm studies, the rarity of the disease and the 
challenges to compare the results with data from historical controls and in the literature, the currently 
available data are deemed to support the efficacy of avelumab in both pre-treated and 
chemotherapy-naïve patients. 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means 
that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review 
new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data for 1st line 
treatment in the context of a conditional MA: 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 89/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy for chemotherapy-naïve treated patients, the MAH should submit 
the final results of study EMR 100070-003 – Part B. The final results of the study should be 
submitted by 30th January 2020.  
The CHMP considers that additional supportive data on efficacy will be provided also from the following 
post-authorisation safety study: 
• 
PASS: German real-world cohort study should be submitted as additional PhV activity to address 
the missing information of safety and efficacy in immune compromised patients.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety review was based on the primary analysis of the pivotal Phase II EMR100070-003 (003) study 
conducted in patients with MCC (data cut-off date 03 March 2016). In addition, safety data with data 
cut-off date 20 November 2015 was included from the Phase I EMR100070-001 (001) study in patients 
with advanced solid tumours treated with 10 mg/kg q 2 weeks, which at the data cut-off date included 
1452 patients with the following tumour types: NSCLC (23 %), ovarian cancer (16 %), gastric and 
gastroesophageal cancer (13 %), metastatic breast cancer (12 %), urothelial carcinoma (11 %) and 
head/neck cancer (10 %). A pooled safety set with study EMR-003 has also been compiled. Updated 
safety data for both studies were also taken into account (data cut off: 09 Jun 2016) yielding a total 
patient population of 1738 subjects.

Immune-related Adverse Events by severity 
In the overall population, 14.2% of the patients experienced immune-related AEs (irAEs) (17% in Study 003), the 
most common events being hypothyroidism and rash, along with an overall low incidence of Grade ≥ 3 irAEs (2.2%). 
Grade 4 irAEs were reported only in Study 001. There were 3 subjects with irAE with fatal outcomes (acute hepatic 
failure, pneumonitis, hepatic failure and autoimmune hepatitis), none of them new in the updated safety analysis. 
However, new irAEs have been observed (type I diabetes mellitus, myositis), which have been added to the SmPC. It 
is noted that 5 subjects (1 subject in SCS) experienced immune-related psoriasis, 4 cases were grade 2 and 1 case 
Grade 3. Three cases were considered related to avelumab by the Investigator. In addition, one case of Grade 3 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 94/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) have been reported among the immune-related AEs and considered 
related to avelumab by investigator. There were 2 events recorded as immune-related rheumatoid arthritis. However, 
review of both subjects with rheumatoid arthritis by a rheumatologist led to the conclusion that the formal criteria for

involved joints, and the specific joints involved was available. This is noted.

Among patients who had IRRs (439), 63 (14.4%) experienced one or more subsequent IRR (46 one 
further episode only, 14 two further episodes and 3 three or more further episodes of IRR).  
Adverse Drug Reactions 
Based on guidance documents, criteria were established and clinical review was conducted to identify 
relevant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for inclusion in Table 2 of section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
● In the absence of control groups in studies EMR 100070-001 and EMR 100070-003, all Preferred Terms 
of AEs in these studies regardless of causality assessment by Investigators reported at a frequency of ≥ 
10% of subjects in the pooled safety dataset of 1738 subjects treated with avelumab in various solid 
tumours were included. 
● In addition, all Preferred Terms of events that, following medical evaluation, met the pre-specified 
criteria for classification of immune-related adverse events or an infusion-related reaction with a timely 
relationship as per the definitions provided in updated Module 2.7.4, section 2.1.8 were included. Note: 
All IRR diagnoses (irrespective of incidence) and any IRR symptoms occurring in ≥ 3% subjects were to 
be included in the product information. 
As per D120 List of Question comment on the SmPC, the ADR table in section 4.8 was revised to reflect 
the pooled safety dataset of studies EMR 100070-001 and EMR 100070-003 (data cut-off date: 
09Jun2016). As data from controlled studies are not available, a table including all ADRs and matching 
Table 2 of section 4.8 of the SmPC by severity is included below (see updated SmPC, Module 1.3.1, 
section 4.8, Table 2). This table also provides frequencies of respective events assessed as related by 
Expected adverse reactions in patients treated with avelumab in clinical 
investigator.

In a safety update (data cut-off date 09 June 2016), distribution of events of Grades ≥ 3 in the combined 
001 + 003 study population were presented for a total of 1738 patients. Among Grade 3 events (N=650, 
37 %), anaemia was the most frequently reported (5.8%), followed by hypertension (4.3%), 
hyponatremia (3.7%) and dyspnoea (3.5%). Other TEAEs with an incidence of ≥ 2 % included abdominal 
pain (2.9%), fatigue (2.9%), and pneumonia (2.0%). Grade 4 events constituted 7.5 % (N=130) with 
EMA/496529/2017

sepsis was the most frequently reported (1.3%), followed by lipase increased (0.6%) and respiratory 
failure (0.6%). Other TEAEs with at least 5 subjects reporting included hypokalaemia and dyspnoea (each 
0.5%), acute kidney injury (0.3%), and hyponatremia (0.3%). Grade 5 events (13 %) were in the vast 
majority due to disease progression (8.4%) and 0.5% died due to respiratory failure. Other fatal events 
that occurred in at least 5 subjects included pneumonia (0.3%) and sepsis (0.3%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Table 52: 
Most Common Serious TEAEs (at Least 2 Subjects in the Total Group) by SOC 
and PT – All Subjects

About 40 % (similar in the respective studies) experienced a serious TEAE. The most frequently reported 
by PT was disease progression in both studies (4.5% in study 003 and 8 % in study 001). In the 003 study 
serious TEAEs reported in > 1 subject each were acute kidney injury, anaemia, abdominal pain, asthenia, 
cellulitis, and general physical health deterioration. In study 001, other serious TEAEs reported > 2% of 
subjects each were dyspnoea, abdominal pain, pleural effusion, and pneumonia. 
Relatedness to study drug was considered in about 6 % of the patients in study 003 (enterocolitis, 
infusion related reaction, transaminases increased, chondrocalcinosis, synovitis and tubule-interstitial 
nephritis in one patient each). In study 001, a similar proportion was reported. 
Deaths 
Table 53: 
Deaths by Primary Reason – All Subjects 
In the 003 study about half of the patients died (49 %) with the vast majority due to disease progression 
(46 %). There were no patients who died due to AE as the primary reason although it is to be noted whilst 
8 patients (9%) were reported with TEAEs with a fatal outcome, the primary cause of death was 
considered due to PD.  
In the larger 001 study, few AE-related fatalities were reported (3 % in total regardless of related or not).

No dose adjustment is proposed on the basis of age. An analysis of TEAEs in patients > 65 years or ≤65, 
as well as for patients >75 and ≤75 years, were provided for the avelumab treatment as showed in table 
above.

TEAEs 
TEAEs with at least a 5% difference between males and females respectively in the pooled safety set, 
were fatigue (27 % vs 32 %), weight decreased (18 % vs 13 %), nausea (18 % vs 27 %), diarrhoea (14 
% vs 20 %), vomiting (12 % vs 17 %), abdominal pain (10 % vs 15 %), and urinary tract infection (3 % 
vs 12 %). 
IrAEs and IRRs were similar between males and females. 
Race 
The vast majority of the patients were Caucasian (92 % and 82 % in 003 and 001 respectively).

Table 71: 
Most Common TEAEs Leading to Permanent Treatment Discontinuation (at 
Least 2 Subjects in the Total Group) by SOC and PT – All Subjects; abbreviated 
by the assessor 
Updated: Overall, 6.2% of the patients discontinued avelumab due to treatment-related TEAEs. In Study 
003, 3 additional subjects were reported to have treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation (total of 4 subjects, PTs of GGT increased, ALT increased, blood CPK increased, ileus, and 
transaminase increased [the latter was already reported]). One additional case of treatment 
discontinuation, already described in the previous SCS, was reported beyond the on-treatment period 
(increased creatinine due to treatment-related interstitial nephritis). 
Dose reductions and Dose delays 
Dose reductions where not foreseen in the 003 and 001studies as this was not allowed as per clinical 
study protocols. Dose reductions in this analysis were defined as a dose of < 90% of the planned dose. 
Potential reasons for a dose < 90% of the planned dose included premature discontinuations of an 
infusion due to occurrence of an IRR and an increased weight not taken into account for calculation of the 
planned dose at a given visit. Maximum deviations in the schedule of 1 or 2 days were not considered as 
a delay.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse reactions were reported for 88 patients with metastatic MCC treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg 
and adverse reactions reported for 1,650 patients in a phase I study in other solid tumours.  As it is not 
anticipated that the safety profile of a mAb would differ to any major extent relative to different types of 
solid tumours, hence, the pooling of the safety data is acceptable as it allows for a more comprehensive 
evaluation of the short term safety.  
The mean/median treatment duration was 23 w/17 weeks and 15 w/12 weeks in 003 and 001 
respectively with a maximum number of avelumab infusions of 35 and 51 (median 7 infusions) 
respectively. The vast majority  achieved a relative dose intensity of > 90 % with a fair consistency 
throughout cycles.  
The TEAEs reported were similar across the studies. TEAEs reported in ≥ 15% of patients in study 003 
were (in decreasing rates) fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, decreased appetite, peripheral oedema, 
constipation, cough and arthralgia whilst in study 001 it was fatigue, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, 
infusion related reaction, decreased appetite and weight decreased.  
The vast majority of the TEAEs reported in both studies were considered related to study drug (71 % in 
the 003 study and 65 % in 001). Almost all patients experienced at least one TEAE and whilst there was 
quite a high proportion Grade ≥3 and serious TEAEs reported (61 % and 41 % in 003; 50 % and 40 % in 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 111/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
001), the treatment was relatively well tolerated was demonstrated by the low rate of permanent 
treatment discontinuations (2.3 % in 003 and 13 % in 001). Dose escalation or reduction is not 
recommended. Dosing delay or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and 
tolerability; see Table 1 of the SmPC. 
A high proportion of Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in the respective studies (61 % in study 003 and 50 % in 
study 001). In study 003, TEAEs with Grade ≥ 3 reported in ≥ 3% of subjects were anaemia, 
hypertension, disease progression, lymphopenia, GGT increased and lipase increased whilst in study 001, 
it was disease progression, anaemia, dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hyponatremia.  
The most frequently reported serious TEAE was disease progression in both studies (4.5% in study 003 
and 8 % in study 001). In the 003 study serious TEAEs reported in > 1 subject each were acute kidney 
injury, anaemia, abdominal pain, asthenia, cellulitis, and general physical health deterioration. In study 
001, other serious TEAEs reported > 2% of subjects each were dyspnoea, abdominal pain, pleural 
effusion, and pneumonia. Relatedness to study drug was considered in about 6 % of the patients in study 
003 (enterocolitis, infusion related reaction, transaminases increased, chondrocalcinosis, synovitis and 
tubule-interstitial nephritis in one patient each). In study 001, a similar proportion was reported. 
In a safety update (data cut-off date 09 June 2016) in the combined 001 + 003 study population for a 
total of 1738 patients, Grade 3 events (N=650, 37 %) were observed for anaemia (5.8%), hypertension 
(4.3%), hyponatremia (3.7%) and dyspnoea (3.5%), Grade 4 events were observed for sepsis (1.3%), 
lipase increased (0.6%) and respiratory failure (0.6%). Other TEAEs with at least 5 subjects reporting 
included hypokalaemia and dyspnoea (each 0.5%), acute kidney injury (0.3%), and hyponatremia 
(0.3%). Grade 5 events (13 %) were predominantly due to disease progression (8.4%) and 0.5% died 
due to respiratory failure, 0.3% from pneumonia and 0.3% from sepsis. 
Immune related adverse events were not considered higher than what is expected for an immunotherapy 
agent (overall 16 % in study 003 and 11 % in study 001 with the rate of Grade ≥3 rather low [1 % in 003 
and 1.6 % in 001]. Detailed guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse reactions 
(immune-related hepatitis, immune-related colitis, immune-related endocrinopaties, immune-related 
nephritis) are described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. A description of relevant immune-related ADRs 
(immune related pneumonitis, immune related hepatitis, immune related colitis, immune related 
endocrinopathies,  immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction, are presented in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
Avelumab is most frequently associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, including 
severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of avelumab 
(see “Description of selected adverse reactions” below). 
The safety of avelumab has been evaluated in 1,738 patients with solid tumours including metastatic MCC 
receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks of avelumab in clinical studies. In this patient population, the most 
common adverse reactions with avelumab were fatigue (32.4%), nausea (25.1%), diarrhoea (18.9%), 
decreased appetite (18.4%), constipation (18.4%), infusion-related reactions (17.1%), weight 
decreased (16.6%), and vomiting (16.2%). 
The most common Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were anaemia (6.0%), dyspnoea (3.9%), and abdominal 
pain (3.0%). Serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and infusion-related 
reaction (see section 4.4). 
Approximately 7 % and 6 % of the patients in 003 and 001 respectively, required steroid treatment for 
irAEs whereof 4.5% and 3.4% received high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Systemic high-dose 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 112/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
corticosteroid treatment was given for 1.1% and 1.2% of the patients with Grade ≥ 3 irAEs in 003 and 
001 respectively. 
A similar proportion of patients experienced at least one infusion-related reaction (IRR) in the 003 and 
001 study (22 % and 24 % respectively). The IRR events were mainly of Grade 1 or 2. Overall, a small 
proportion of subjects (14 subjects [1.0%]) experienced Grade ≥ 3 IRRs (all in study 001) and only 27 
subjects (~ 2 %) permanently discontinued study drug administration due to an IRR (likewise all in study 
001). No fatal IRR was reported in either study and no Grade 4 IRR was reported in the 003 study. A 
warning and recommendation on how to manage IRRs have been included in the SmPC in 4.4. Patients 
have to be premedicated with an antihistamine and with paracetamol prior to the first 4 infusions of 
Bavencio. If the fourth infusion is completed without an infusion-related reaction, premedication for 
subsequent doses should be administered at the discretion of the physician. 
Of 1,738 patients treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, 1,627 were 
evaluable for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 96 (5.9%) tested positive. In ADA 
positive patients, there may be an increased risk for infusion-related reactions (about 40% and 25% in 
ADA ever-positive and ADA never-positive patients, respectively). Based on data available, including the 
low incidence of immunogenicity, the impact of ADA on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety is 
uncertain, while the impact of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) is unknown. 
There were no reports of fatal events due to AEs in study 003. In the larger 001 study, there were rather 
few AE-related fatalities reported (3 % in total regardless of related or not).  
A safety update was provided with additional safety information of 3 months for study 003 and about 7 
months for study 001 (cut-off 9th June 2016). No major concerns were raised on the safety data 
provided, providing further reassurance of the consistency of the safety data.  
There is a lack of data on patients with active central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, active or with a 
history of any autoimmune disease, a history of other malignancies within the last 5 years, organ 
transplant, conditions requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection with HIV or hepatitis 
B or C, as these patients were excluded from the clinical trial (as reflected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC). Hence there is lack of data regarding immunocompromised patients.  In the absence of clinical 
safety data, avelumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the 
potential risk-benefit on an individual basis. An Early Access Programme and the German real-world 
cohort study has been requested as an additional PhV activity (PASS) to address the missing information 
of safety and efficacy in immune compromised patients (patients with autoimmune disease, HIV, 
Hepatitis B or C infections or organ transplants).  
For patients with adrenal insufficiency, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency during and after treatment. Corticosteroids should be administered (1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
prednisone intravenously or oral equivalent) for Grade ≥ 3 adrenal insufficiency followed by a taper until 
a dose of less than or equal to 10 mg/day has been reached. Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 symptomatic adrenal insufficiency (see section 4.2). 
Avelumab can cause Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis (see section 4.8).  Patients 
should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with 
insulin for Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Avelumab should be withheld and anti-hyperglycaemics in patients 
with Grade ≥ 3 hyperglycaemia should be administered. Treatment with avelumab should be resumed 
when metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. 
The effect of avelumab on male and female fertility is unknown. Although studies to evaluate the effect of 
avelumab on fertility have not been conducted, there were no notable effects in the female reproductive 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 113/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
organs in monkeys based on 1 month and 3 month repeat dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). In 
addition, human IgG1 immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. Therefore, avelumab 
has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. It is not recommended to 
use avelumab during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
avelumab. 
Avelumab has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported 
following administration of avelumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised to use caution when 
driving or operating machinery until they are certain that avelumab does not adversely affect them. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
Three patients were reported to be overdosed with 5% to 10% above the recommended dose of 
avelumab. The patients had no symptoms, did not require any treatment for the overdose, and continued 
on avelumab therapy. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions. The treatment is directed to the management of symptoms. 
Special precautions for disposal and  handling instructions are presented in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data collected at an earlier data cut remains consistent with longer follow up.  No major 
concerns have been identified in the updated analysis. The safety of avelumab in the proposed indication 
appears to be acceptable and manageable with the recommendations as proposed in the SmPC and the 
RMP. The safety risks associated with immune related adverse reactions are managed through additional 
risk minimisation activities implemented in the form of educational materials that will inform HCPs and 
patients on how to identify and properly handle suspected immune related ADRs.     
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
PASS: German real-world cohort study should be submitted as additional PhV activity to address

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23 March 2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that avelumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers avelumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Bavencio (avelumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance and is to be approved under a conditional 
marketing authorisation.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive, neuroendocrine cancer associated with UV exposure, Merkel 
cell polyomavirus, immunosuppression (8-10% of the MCC patients, mainly in relation to CLL, organ 
transplant and HIV infection, associated with a bleak prognosis) and elderly Caucasians (≥65 years old).  
Its incidence is 0.2-0.4 cases/100 000 individuals / year in Europe, while in the US it is 0.79 and in 
Australia 1.6 (where it is mainly linked to ultraviolet exposure). The median age at diagnosis is around 75 
years. A minority of cases are metastatic at presentation, 5-12%. The overall 5-year survival for 
node-negative disease is about 60%, in regional nodal disease at presentation about 40% and drops to 
<20% in the metastatic setting. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no approved therapies for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma where the standard of 
care is chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The most commonly used first-line chemotherapy regimen in 
disseminated disease is a platinum compound ± etoposide, resulting in high response rates (60-70%), 
but poor duration of response. With respect to relapsed disease, study data are sparse, but the ORR is 
much lower than in the first-line setting and duration is brief.  
There is an unmet medical need for both first-line and in treatment experienced patients with metastatic 
disease.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study EMR100070-003 is an ongoing multicentre, single-arm study designed in 2 parts to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in subjects with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC): 
−  Part A tested avelumab in patients with mMCC previously treated with at least one line of 
chemotherapy and progressed after the most recent regimen – second line or later therapy 
(n=88) 
−  Part B is ongoing and includes chemotherapy treatment-naïve mMCC patients – first line therapy 
(n=39).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The results from Part A in previously treated mMCC patients showed an overall ORR of 33%, formally 
rejecting the null hypothesis of ORR≤20%.  The majority of responses (22/29) were observed early, 
around week 6-7 and these responses proved to be durable: in the pre-planned analysis at 12 months 
after the last patient started treatment (cutoff 3rd of September 2016), from 29 patients with a confirmed 
response, 25 had a DOR>6 months. The longest ongoing response durations included one CR of 23.3 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 119/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
months and 3 patients with 18 months response, 2 of which were CRs. The median PFS was 2.7 months 
(95% CI 1.4-6.9) and the immune-related median PFS was 4 months (95% CI 2.3, - ).  
The prelimiary results for Part B in treatment-naïve patients are consistent with the results in pre-treated 
patients and non-confirmed BOR was about 70%, i.e. comparable to what is achievable with intensive 
chemotherapy. Based on the tumour activity observed, a detrimental effect on OS is not expected. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As the 003 study was designed as a single arm trial, there is no comparator arm to determine the true 
effect size observed for avelumab in terms of ORR, DOR and PFS for both chemotherapy-treated and 
naive patients. The retrospective observational study included few patients and only descriptive analyses 
were performed. Hence, as the data is not deemed to be robust, no clear conclusion could be drawn from 
the study and the data can only be considered as supportive. As chemotherapy-treated patients have few 
options after relapse, avelumab appears to be at least as good, if not better than chemotherapy for 2nd 
line treatment. For 1st line treatment, while ORR and DOR appear promising, more mature PFS data are 
required from Part B in order to better estimate patient benefit. Data from the final analysis are required 
to confirm the magnitude of the effect of the treatment in terms of PFS, but also in terms of possible 
patient survival. Therefore the CHMP recommends a conditional approval with the specific obligation to 
submit the final results from Study EMR 100070-003 Part B. 
A relationship between PDL-1 expression and ORR has been demonstrated and MCV expression seems to 
also impact on ORR. Therefore, the CHMP recommends the applicant to try to identify biomarkers that will 
help select patients that are likely to benefit from avelumab.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The pooling of the safety from both studies and of the different indications is acceptable as the safety 
profile of avelumab would not differ relative to other types of solid tumours. The safety database is 
considered acceptable and of sufficient size in order to identifying most of the safety risks associated with 
avelumab treatment. The safety update provided an additional follow up of 3 months for study 003 and 
about 7 months for study 001. No new major concerns regarding the safety profile of avelumab was raised 
although long term safety has been included in the RMP as missing information. The safety of avelumab 
has been evaluated in 1,738 patients with solid tumours including metastatic MCC receiving 10 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks of avelumab in clinical studies. In this patient population, the most common adverse 
reactions with avelumab were fatigue (32.4%), nausea (25.1%), diarrhoea (18.9%), decreased appetite 
(18.4%), constipation (18.4%), infusion-related reactions (17.1%), weight decreased (16.6%), and 
vomiting (16.2%). 
The ADRs identified are consistent between the two studies submitted. No concerns were raised in terms 
of tolerability for avelumab from an exposure perspective and the ADRs identified consistent with those 
expected for an immunotherapy. Immune-related ADRs such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, 
endocrinopathies (thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, pituitary disorders), 
nephritis and renal dysfunction as well as other immune-related events (myositis, myocarditis, 
Guillain-Barre Syndrome, uveitis) have been included in the RMP as important identified risks and will be 
managed through routine as well as additional risk minimisation activities. Educational material will be 
provided to patients and HCP in order to increase awareness and provide information concerning the signs 
and symptoms of certain important identified risks of avelumab. 
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 120/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The most common Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were anaemia (6.0%), dyspnoea (3.9%), and abdominal 
pain (3.0%). Serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and infusion-related 
reaction (see section 4.4). 
Approximately 7 % and 6 % of the patients in 003 and 001 respectively, required steroid treatment for 
irAEs whereof 4.5% and 3.4% received high-dose corticosteroid therapy. High-dose corticosteroid 
treatment was given for 1.1% and 1.2% of the patients with Grade ≥ 3 irAEs in 003 and 001 
respectively. Recommendation on the use of steroids to manage immune related ADRs are included in the 
SmPC section 4.4. 
Infusion related reactions (IRR) were observed in the 003 and 001 study (22 % and 24 % respectively). 
No fatal IRR was reported in either study. Recommendation on the management of IRR is included in the 
SmPC section 4.4. Therefore, severe infusion-related reactions (grade ≥ 3) have been included in the RMP 
as an important identified risk.  
No deaths occurred in the studies that have been attributed to avelumab. At the time of the data cut-off 
date in the 003 study, about half of the patients had died (49 %) with the majority due to disease 
progression  
(46 %).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
From the safety database, there is uncertainty as to the potential relationship of avelumab with some of 
the observed immune-related events such as encephalitis, myasthenic syndrome, pancreatitis and severe 
cutaneous reactions. These safety concerns have been included in the RMP as important potential risks 
and will be managed through routine PhV. Embryo-foetal toxicity is also an important potential risk that 
has been described in non-clinical models, however there is no data in humans (SmPC section 4.6 and 
5.3). There is recommendation in the SmPC for women to use effective contraception during treatment. 
There is also missing information on the safety of patients with autoimmune disease, HIV, Hepatitis B or 
C infections and organ transplants as these patients have been excluded from the entry criteria for the 
study EMR100070-003. These will be monitored through routine PhV plan.  
It is unknown whether avelumab is excreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can be 
secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding women should 
be advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose due to the 
potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants. The use of bavencio in lactation was included 
as missing information in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
mMCC is a rare and aggressive cancer where tumour progression is related to symptom worsening and 
death. There is no consensus on the best standard therapy for treating mMCC patients. Patients with 
metastatic disease treated with chemotherapy have shown good tumour responses but responses are 
mostly of short duration and patients progress within a few months.  
After progression on chemotherapy, there are no active next-lines of therapies available. The primary 
endpoint of the pivotal study EMR100070-003 was met and a clinically relevant benefit has been 
demonstrated with avelumab in the treatment of patients that have been previously treated with 
chemotherapy. The reported ORR (33%) for avelumab in the next-line treatment of mMCC is not 
considered outstanding, however, durability of responses is convincing. Preliminary efficacy data seems 
to indicate that chemotherapy naïve patients also respond to treatment, which may result in a better 
outcome than previously treated patients, as patients with fewer lines of treatment seem to respond 
better to treatment. The data is still immature and a further update of the efficacy data is required in order 
to better characterise the treatment effect. The safety of avelumab is as expected for an immunotherapy 
product with immune adverse reactions which will be monitored through routine and additional risk 
minimisation activities. In general the safety is considered acceptable and manageable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable results with avelumab monotherapy in both naïve and pretreated mMCC patients terms of 
ORR and DOR outweigh the safety risks observed and are considered acceptable.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The indication is based on the submitted data from Part A of the pivotal EMR100070-003 study which 
included chemotherapy-pretreated mMCC patients as well as Part B which enrolled 112 treatment-naïve 
subjects. The applicant has provided interim data of Part B, including 25 treatment-naïve patients 
followed for a minimum of 6 weeks (among them, 16 have ≥ 13 weeks follow up and 5 ≥ 6 months follow 
up).   The preliminary data provided from Part B showed high response rates to avelumab in 
treatment-naïve patients, as well as preliminary evidence of prolonged duration of responses in some 
patients. This could be seen as a confirmation of the results in 2+ line setting and as such, it is expected 
that mMCC patients treated in first line would also derive a clinically meaningful benefit in a rare disease 
where there are no approved treatment options. There was no evidence of a detrimental effect in naïve 
patients in terms of PFS or survival, although the follow up data is currently limited. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that there was enough clinical evidence to not restrict the line of treatment in the indication.   
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product are not available, a 
conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 concerning conditional marketing 
authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and is designated as an orphan 
medicinal product.  
EMA/496529/2017  
Page 124/131 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation for the reasons detailed below: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive: A positive benefit risk has been demonstrated in treatment naïve 
patients as well as pretreated patients, as discussed above.   
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data: The applicant is in a position 
to provide further updated data in the ongoing Part B of study EMR100070-003 to confirm the 
observed clinical benefit. The CHMP considers that the totality of data available after submission of 
these results will be comprehensive for this condition. 
•  Unmet medical needs will be fulfilled: There are no approved treatments for this highly aggressive 
condition. Chemotherapy is currently the de facto standard of care (although not authorised for this 
condition), with a good ORR but patients relapse quickly as the durability of the response is short. 
Avelumab, based on the available scientific data, is expected to provide non-inferior ORR, longer 
duration of response and more favourable safety profile, as compared with the current standard of 
care. 
• 
The benefit to public health of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market outweighs 
the risks due to need for further data: The safety of avelumab appears consistent with other targeted 
immunotherapeutic products such as anti-PD-1/PDL-1 targeting medicinal products and is superior to 
safety of current de facto standard of care chemotherapy (but not authorised for this condition). The 
safety risks will be mitigated by routine PhV as well as educational material as additional risk 
minimisation measures. In the absence of approved therapies in this life threatening condition, and 
taking into account the positive benefit-risk balance of avelumab, the CHMP considered that it would 
be appropriate to allow immediate availability of avelumab on the market. 
It is proposed that the final results of study part B would be considered as specific obligations. The 
applicant is required to provide the study report of the primary analysis which will be conducted 15 
months after the accrual of the last subject (Q2 2019), by 30 January 2020. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bavencio is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report.

Divergent position – Bavencio (EMEA/H/C/004338) 
It is the opinion of the undersigned members: 
The evidence available to date regarding efficacy and safety of Bavencio (avelumab) in the 
chemotherapy-naïve mMCC population is considered insufficient to support a positive benefit/risk. 
Current data on the treatment-naïve mMCC patients from the pivotal study EMR100070-003 (Cohort B) 
indicate an ORR of 71% in 14 patients with at least 6 months follow up and an ORR of 65% in the 29 pts 
with at least 13 weeks follow-up. From these data no superiority in ORR can be concluded when compared 
to chemotherapy (ORR up to 70%). The median DoR of chemotherapy is 6 months, however, the DoR in 
Bavencio-treated patients is immature and early evidence of durability is observed in only 6 subjects 
reported to have a DoR  of at least 6 months. Further concerns are raised over the very small number of 
patients enrolled in Part-B of Study 003 (n=29/112) and the limited follow-up duration taking into 
consideration that alternative treatment options (i.e., chemotherapy) are available with relatively high 
rates of response. Moreover, indirect comparison with sparse historical data does not support superiority 
of Bavencio in terms of efficacy in comparison with chemotherapy. 
Furthermore, extrapolation of data from the second to the first line is hampered, since the first line 
population compared to the second line population may have different prognostic characteristics e.g. less 
indolent disease, lower mutational loads etc. Moreover, in second line patients part of the susceptibility to 
immunotherapy could be related to the higher mutational load induced by platinum containing therapy, 
whereas part of the susceptibility in first line may be more related to disruption of the immune response 
after DNA integration of MCV.  
The unmet need in this setting is acknowledged, as well as the rarity of the disease. However, whether 
and to what extent Bavencio can fulfill the unmet medical in the mMCC treatment naïve population is 
unclear at this time.  
In view of all the above, the B/R of Bavencio in a mMCC chemotherapy naïve population is considered 
negative at this time and approval cannot be granted for this population.

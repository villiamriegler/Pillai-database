T2DM is a progressive metabolic disorder characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia associated with 
increased risk of long-term micro-and macrovascular complications. Diabetes has been identified as an 
independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which represents the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in subjects with diabetes. Thus, the risk of cardiovascular disease is 2−4 times greater for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 5/73 
 
  
  
 
 
patients with T2DM compared to the general population, and death from cardiovascular causes is the 
most common cause of death in patients with T2DM. 
Even with use of standard of care therapies to control cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of 
cardiovascular disease in subjects with diabetes remains to be more than double that in subjects without 
diabetes. Hence, the cardiovascular safety of antidiabetic drugs is of paramount importance. 
Drug profile and target indication 
Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is a combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide. Insulin 
degludec (IDeg) is a basal insulin analogue with a duration of action beyond 42 hours at clinically relevant 
doses. Liraglutide is an analogue of the endogenous human hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). 
Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and inhibits glucagon secretion 
when plasma glucose levels are above normal. Liraglutide also reduces body weight and body fat mass 
through mechanisms involving reduced hunger and decreased energy intake. 
IDegLira (Xultophy) is approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), to 
improve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these 
alone, or combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or basal insulin, do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control. 
Xultophy received regulatory approval in the EU in September 2014. 
Rationale for the variation application and assessment 
The cardiovascular risk profiles as well as long-term safety profiles of the components of IDegLira have 
recently been established through CVOTs for liraglutide (Trial 3748) and IDeg (Trial 4080). Based on the 
long-term exposure and safety data obtained in these trials, updates to the Victoza (liraglutide) and 
Tresiba (IDeg) product information have been made.  
The MAH considers that several of these modifications are also relevant for IDegLira, and is therefore 
submitting this variation application proposing updates to the Xultophy product information, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.8 and 5.1. 
Since both trials already have been thoroughly assessed by the CHMP, the following assessment will focus 
on the data supporting the specific changes to the product information for Xultophy. Emphasis is put on 
the proposed inclusion of reference to the effect of Xultophy on cardiovascular events in section 4.1. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Two non-GLP in vivo studies have been conducted to assess the effect of liraglutide in animal models of 
atherosclerosis. 
Effect on atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE knock-out mice treated with liraglutide 
(Gura140701; divided in 3 sub-studies GuRa140701, GuRa 141101 and BidR13101) 
The effect of liraglutide on prevention and regression of atherosclerotic plaques was studied  in female 
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) KO mice 9-12 weeks old at study start. The animals were fed western diet (WD) 
Assessment report

Page 6/73 
 
  
  
 
and treated with either liraglutide (1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle s.c. for 6-15 weeks. Since liraglutide reduce 
food intake and body weight it was also investigated if the body weight reduction alone could prevent 
athesclerotic plaque formation in WD fed ApoE KO mice. Finally the gene expression in the plaque and 
plasma lipids was measured. 
Liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and prevented further aorta intima thickening in animals 
fed WD. Weight loss was not able to show similar effect on plaque prevention as liraglutide treatment. 
Triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were not affected in neither of the treated groups. 
In animals with established plaques aortic plaque area was not affected by liraglutide treatment. 
However, the triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were decreased by liraglutide whereas 
HDL cholesterol was increased. Body weight was slightly lower in the liraglutide treated group compared 
to vehicle. 
Liraglutide led to changes in 21 genes compared to the vehicle treated group. Liraglutide prevented WD 
induced changes involved in inflammatory genes encoding for proteins comprising inflammatory 
processes related to leukocyte recruitment (e.g. Ccr2, Cxcl12, Cx3cr1) and adhesion (Cx3cr1, Itga3, 
Thy1) as well as lipid signalling (e.g Ptgir) and fibrinolysis (Plat). 
Effect on atherosclerosis in LDL receptor knock out mice treated with liraglutide (GuRa 
141102) 
The effect of liraglutide in plaque formation was studied in male pro-atherosclerotic low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (r) KO mice 10-11 weeks of age at study start. The animals were fed (WD) and 
were treated with liraglutide at 1.0 mg/kg/day for 17 weeks. At termination plasma triglycerides (TG), 
total cholesterol (T-Chol), vLDL, LDL and HDL were measured and thoracic aorta was excised and plaque 
lesion levels were quantified. Thoracic aorta was further used to evaluate the expression levels of several 
inflammatory markers by NanoString analyses. 
In pro-atherosclerotic male LDLr KO mice liraglutide prevented development of plaque in the aorta. 
Treatment with liraglutide also showed beneficial effects on plasma lipids resulting in a significant 
reduction in plasma TG, VLDL, LDL and an increase in HDL. Liraglutide treatment reduced body weight 
and body weight gain. In addition, treatment with liraglutide prevented the WD induced up regulation of, 
Interleukin-6, Matrix metalloproteinase 12 and 13, CD68, Cathepsin S, Neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
lipocalin, interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist, macrophage scavanger 1, serum amyloid A3 and secreted 
Phosphoprotein 1, predominantly genes related to inflammation. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Xultophy consists of two drug substances, insulin degludec and liraglutide, which are characterized as 
peptides. 
According to the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human use, 
substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from 
environmental risk assessment since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
It is agreed that no environmental risk assessment is necessary for insulin degludec and liraglutide. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The studies have recently been submitted and assessed in a variation for Victoza 
EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0042. EPAR-AR Var dated 22 June 2017 and published 14 September 2017. The 
studies demonstrate that liraglutide attenuates the development of plaques in two different animal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 7/73 
 
  
  
models of atherosclerosis. The reduced plaque formation was not attributed to weight loss, or reduced 
body weight gain, as an active comparator causing greater body weight reduction than liraglutide, did not 
have an inhibitory effect on plaque formation. 
Liraglutide has in addition a beneficial effect on plasma lipids, reducing TG, VLDL; LDL and increasing 
HDL. This may also contribute to the prevention of plaque formation according to the MAH. 
In the aorta, liraglutide significantly affected mRNA expression encoding for proteins associated with 
atherosclerosis, primarily representing inflammatory pathways such as leukocyte recruitment, adhesion 
and migration. 
The new data supports that liraglutide reduces the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and additionally 
has an anti-inflammatory effect in the cardiovascular system in ApoE- and LDLreceptor knock out (KO) 
mice fed a Western Diet (WD). However, in animals with established plaques aortic plaque area was not 
affected by liraglutide treatment. 
The proposed “non-clinical” changes in the SmPC section 5.1 in bold italics below have been agreed and 
included in the SmPC for Victoza and are considered to be acceptable: 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
[……………………………] 
Mechanism of action 
[……………………………] 
GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune 
system, and kidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, liraglutide prevented aortic plaque 
progression and reduced inflammation in the plaque. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial 
effect on plasma lipids. Liraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established 
plaques. 
[……………………………] 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, insulin degludec and liraglutide are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
The proposed “non-clinical” changes in the SmPC section 5.1 as indicated above (in bold italics) is 
acceptable and in line with the SmPC for Victoza. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In this dossier, the results of two cardiovascular outcome trials are presented. Both studies have been 
previously assessed by the CHMP, therefore an abbreviated description of the studies is provided in this 
assessment report. 
• 
Trial 3748 – LEADER - inclusion of data in the SmPC for Victoza (liraglutide) was approved in July 
2017 through procedure EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0042.

• 
Trial 4080 – DEVOTE - inclusion of data in the SmPC for Tresiba (IDegLira) was approved in Sept 
2017 through procedure EMEA/H/C/002498/II/0028. 
With this application the MAH propose to include reference to the effect of Xultophy on cardiovascular 
events in section 4.1. Therefore the relevance of the data obtained with the monocomponents has to be 
justified. Other changes proposed with this application mainly relates to updated safety information 
concerning liraglutide based on new safety data obtained with trial 3478. 
Both studies were designed to investigate the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide and IDeg, respectively. 
However, as the data on cardiovascular outcome is relevant for the assessment of the proposed change 
to the indication, the cardiovascular outcome is presented in the efficacy part of this report. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
LEADER: Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular 
outcome Results. A long-term, multi-centre, international, randomised double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial to determine liraglutide effects on cardiovascular events 
Methods 
Trial 3748 was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial performed to determine the effect and safety of liraglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular 
outcomes. Both liraglutide and placebo were used in addition to standard of care therapy. 
The duration of trial 3748 was driven by both number of MACEs and by time. Thus, trial 3748 ended once 
all subjects had had a minimum treatment period of 42 months (plus a follow-up period of 30 days), and 
once at least 611 EAC-confirmed MACEs were recorded. The minimum period of 42 months was defined in 
order to provide data on long-term exposure to liraglutide and allow assessments of relevant safety 
parameters of interest. Trial 3748 included a recruitment period of 18 months, resulting in a maximum 
treatment period of 60 months. 
A schematic presentation of the key features of trial 3748, including trial design and population is 
provided in Figure 1.

Treatments 
The intended treatment dose for liraglutide was 1.8 mg/day, the maximum daily dose allowed according 
to the product information. The dose level of liraglutide or placebo was escalated from an initial dose of 
0.6 mg/day (during the first week), with weekly dose escalation steps of 0.6 mg to the target dose level 
of 1.8 mg/day. The dose could be reduced (to 1.2 or 0.6 mg/day) at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator. Subjects were allowed to go on and off treatment during the trial, if decided by the 
investigator. 
To ensure that all subjects in both treatment groups were optimally treated and to eliminate other factors 
influencing the results of the trial, investigators were encouraged to administer best-practice standard of 
care treatment in addition to trial product.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of trial 3748 was to assess the effect of liraglutide compared to placebo in addition 
to standard of care for at least 3.5 years and up to 5 years on the incidence of cardiovascular events in 
adults with T2DM and at high risk of cardiovascular events. The secondary objective was to assess the 
safety and effectiveness with regards to clinically important events or other surrogate parameters of 
treatment with liraglutide compared to placebo on top of standard of care. Furthermore, the trial was 
designed to include a sufficient number of subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment, to be able 
to explore the safety and effectiveness of liraglutide in these subgroups of subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of a composite 
cardiovascular outcome (MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. 
The following secondary time-to-event endpoints were used as supportive endpoints for the primary 
objective: 
− 
time from randomisation to first occurrence of an expanded composite cardiovascular outcome, 
defined as either cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, coronary 
revascularisation, hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris, or hospitalisation for heart failure 
− 
time from randomisation to all-cause death 
− 
− 
time from randomisation to non-cardiovascular death 
time from randomisation to each individual component of the expanded composite cardiovascular 
outcome 
In addition, a number of time-to-event endpoints were used as supportive endpoints for the secondary 
objectives. These included time from randomisation to first occurrence of a composite microvascular 
outcome (related to retinopathy and nephropathy). 
Furthermore, to explore the difference in risk between liraglutide and placebo for progression of renal 
damage, in subjects with moderate renal failure at screening defined as eGFR 30 - < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
per MDRD time from randomisation to first occurrence of a second composite nephropathy outcome was 
analysed.

Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), prior to un-blinding, and in 
accordance with ICH E9: 
• 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) included all randomised subjects. The statistical evaluation of the FAS 
followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, and subjects contributed to the evaluation ‘as 
randomised’. 
Per Protocol (PP) analysis set included all subjects who took at least one dose of the 
investigational product and these subjects were considered exposed until the accumulated 
number of days off investigational drugs exceeded 120 days. 
Primary analysis 
The primary endpoint was: 
• 
Time from randomisation to first occurrence of a composite cardiovascular endpoint (MACE): 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. 
In the FAS, observation time was defined as the duration from the date of randomisation to date of last 
contact with the subject. The primary analysis was conducted for the FAS using the Cox regression model 
(including treatment group as factor) to estimate the hazard ratio (liraglutide/placebo) and the 2-sided 
95% confidence interval (CI). Non-inferiority of liraglutide versus placebo was considered confirmed, if 
the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the hazard ratio was below 1.3 or if the p-value for the one-
sided test of H0: HR ≥1.3 against Ha: HR <1.3 was less than 2.5%. If non-inferiority was established a 
test for superiority was to be performed. Superiority of liraglutide was confirmed, if the upper limit of the 
two-sided 95% CI for the hazard ratio was below 1.0 or if the p-value for the one-sided test of H0: HR 
≥1.0 against Ha: HR <1.0 was less than 2.5% (or equivalent to 5% two-sided test). 
Sensitivity analyses of primary endpoint and exploratory analyses of treatment differences within 
subgroups 
• 
• 
The primary analysis was repeated on the PP analysis set. Furthermore, as subjects could go on 
and off treatment, sensitivity analyses were performed for events occurring on randomised 
treatment +1 day and for events occurring on randomised treatment + 30 days. 
Exploratory analyses of the primary endpoint were performed in several subgroups including 
cardiovascular risk and renal function. The effect (main effect and interaction with treatment) was 
explored by adding these to the original Cox model. Hazard ratios and 2-sided 95% CIs were 
calculated for each subgroup. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
All secondary time-to-event endpoints were analysed by Cox regression models using the FAS (with 
treatment as factor) to estimate the hazard ratios and 2-sided 95% CIs. 
Secondary analyses for effectiveness: 
For HbA1c, body weight, blood pressure and lipids, change from baseline to the 3-year assessment, and 
change from baseline to end of treatment were analysed using a repeated normal mixed model for 
change from baseline with treatment, antidiabetic therapy at baseline, region, and sex as factors, and 
corresponding baseline value and age at baseline as covariates, with all effects nested within visit. An 
unstructured covariance matrix was used. The analysis at 3 years reflected the time of the last available 
measurement for the entire trial population. For subjects who were insulin-naïve at baseline, an analysis

of time to first use of insulin was performed using a Cox regression with treatment group as factor. The 
Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (liraglutide/placebo) and the two-sided 95% 
CI. Subjects who did not initiate insulin were censored following the principle applied in the primary 
analysis. 
The type I error was not protected beyond the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints are considered 
supportive. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A schematic representation of the trial 3748 subject disposition is provided in Figure 2. 
Figure 2 Subjects disposition of Trial 3748 
Of the 12076 subjects screened, 9340 subjects were randomised 1:1 to either liraglutide or placebo 
treatment (all randomised subjects were included in the full analysis set (FAS).  
To address the primary endpoint related to MACE a completer definition was established. A completer was 
defined as a subject who either had a primary event (MACE) or died due to non-cardiovascular causes, or 
with whom direct contact was established at or after the planned follow-up visit. Strict procedures were 
set up to collect information on subjects who were potentially lost to follow-up, in order to achieve 
information on vital status at trial closure. At the end of the trial it was determined that ~97% of subjects 
were completers and > 99% were either completers or had known vital status in both treatment groups, 
demonstrating a high degree of subject retention in the trial. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between subjects randomised to liraglutide 
and placebo.  
Among all randomised subjects, the mean age was 64.3 years, mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.5 
kg/m2, and 64.3% of the trial population were men. The mean duration of T2DM was 12.8 years and the 
mean HbA1c was 8.7%. Most subjects were White (77.5%), 8.3% of subjects were Black or African 
American and 10% of subjects were Asian.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018

At screening, 81.3% of the subjects were ≥50 years with established cardiovascular disease (of these 
24.7% had chronic kidney failure) and 18.7% of the subjects were ≥60 years with only risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease. A total of 30.1% of all randomised subjects had a history of myocardial infarction 
(MI), 8.4% had a history of unstable angina (UAP) and 14% had chronic heart failure characterised as 
NYHA class II or III at screening. At trial entry, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) per 
MDRD was 80.4 ml/min/1.73m2 and 23.1% of all randomised subjects had moderate or severe renal 
impairment. At screening 40.7% of subjects had diabetic nephropathy, 20.1% had diabetic retinopathy, 
and 34.6% had diabetic neuropathy based on medical history. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics in subgroups 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were evaluated in a number of subgroups: subgroups 
according to age, renal function, heart failure status (NYHA class) and use of pre-mix insulin at baseline. 
In these subgroups analyses of effectiveness were conducted. 
Concomitant medication 
Overall, use of cardiovascular medication was well-balanced between the two treatment groups at 
baseline, with only minor differences between treatment groups. The majority of subjects were treated 
with antihypertensive therapy (most often beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors), lipid-lowering agents (such 
as statins) and/or platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as acetylsalicylic acid). The proportion of subjects 
who initiated treatment with cardiovascular medication during the trial was generally lower in the 
liraglutide group compared to the placebo group across most drug classes. 
Overall, use of antidiabetic medication at baseline was well-balanced between the two treatment groups. 
Metformin was the most commonly used antidiabetic medication at baseline (by 76.5% of all randomised 
subjects), while SUs were used by 50.7% and any insulin (most commonly long-acting agents) was used 
by 44.6% of subjects. Of the total trial population, 3.9% were antidiabetic drug naïve at baseline. A lower 
proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group initiated additional glucose-lowering therapy during the trial 
and a higher proportion remained insulin-naïve throughout the trial compared to the placebo group. A 
minor proportion of subjects initiated treatment with GLP-1 RAs or DPP-4 inhibitors although this was not 
allowed according to the protocol. These subjects were to discontinue treatment with trial product. Trial 
product could be resumed following a wash-out period if disallowed medication was discontinued.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 3-point MACE 
The primary composite cardiovascular endpoint was time from randomisation to first MACE consisting of 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke and non-fatal MI (including silent MI). 
A total of 1302 first EAC-confirmed MACEs were reported in trial 3748 (608 in the liraglutide group and 
694 in the placebo group). 
In the primary Cox analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE, the estimated hazard ratio (liraglutide 
vs placebo) of 0.87 [0.78; 0.97]95% CI was statistically significant and in favour of liraglutide, 
corresponding to an estimated risk reduction of 13%. Since non-inferiority was confirmed in the pre-
specified hierarchy, superiority was then tested and as the upper limit of the 95% CI was below 1.0 
superiority was also established of liraglutide vs placebo; with one-sided p-values (α-level: 0.025) for 
non-inferiority and superiority of p <0.001 and p=0.005, respectively. 
All three components of the primary endpoint appeared to contribute to the reduction in first MACE 
observed with liraglutide (Table 2). In both treatment groups, almost half of the events contributing to 
the primary endpoint were non-fatal MIs. 
In the corresponding Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 3), the development in EAC-confirmed first MACE over 
time is shown. The estimated risk of experiencing a MACE within any certain time from randomisation 
was lower for liraglutide compared to placebo. Similarly, favourable treatment differences were observed 
in the time to first event analysis of the individual components of MACE, with a generally lower risk for 
liraglutide throughout the trial (Figure 3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 15/73 
 
  
  
 
In accordance with the results based on first EAC-confirmed MACE, the total number of EAC-confirmed 
MACEs (first events and recurrent events) and the rate of such events were lower in the liraglutide group 
(735 events/4.12 events per 100 PYO) than in the placebo group (870 events/4.90 events per 100 PYO). 
Again all three components of the endpoint contributed to the treatment difference observed for all 
MACEs (Table 2).

MACE is a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. Plots for time to first event for the 
individual components of MACE include all first events within the individual components regardless of whether these 
contribute to the time to first MACE analysis. 
Abbreviations: CV: cardiovascular; EAC: event adjudication committee; FAS: full analysis set; Lira: liraglutide; 
MACE: major adverse cardiovascular event; MI: myocardial infarction 
A series of pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were made. These included one 
analysis adjusted for additional covariates, one adjusted for additional covariates and random country 
effects or stratification for severe renal disease. All of these pre-specified analyses were consistent with 
the primary analysis supporting the robustness of the results for the primary endpoint. 
In general, no differences were observed in demographics and baseline characteristic in subjects with 
MACE between the two treatment groups. Similarly, there were no major differences in the use of 
cardiovascular medications at baseline or initiated during the trial for subjects with EAC-confirmed MACE 
between the two treatment groups. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
Pre-specified exploratory analyses were performed to evaluate the consistency of the treatment effect 
between liraglutide and placebo in time to first MACE across multiple subgroups. Interpretation of these 
should be made with caution as the study was not powered to detect small or moderate differences in 
treatment effect between subgroups and because adjustments for multiplicity were not made. The benefit 
observed with liraglutide versus placebo was generally consistent across the majority of the pre-defined 
subgroups including sex, age, BMI, race, ethnicity, HbA1c, diabetes duration, heart failure status, and 
antidiabetic therapy (including antidiabetic drug naïve subjects); (Figure 4).

The two individual subgroup analyses where the hazard ratios were above 1 were in subjects from Region 
North America (hazard ratio 1.01) and in subjects’ ≥60 years of age with risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease (hazard ratio 1.20), see Figure 4. In both analyses the lower bound of the 95% CI was below 
Assessment report

0.87 (i.e. including the HR for the primary analysis). The interaction analyses did not give evidence of a 
potential difference in treatment effects between regions (p=0.20), whereas a potential difference in 
treatment effect between cardiovascular risk subgroups was indicated (p=0.04), albeit the risk for false 
significance (type 1 error) as a result of multiple testing should be kept in mind. 
A favourable effect of liraglutide was also observed across subgroups by renal function with point 
estimates consistently < 1 (Figure 4). The benefit of liraglutide compared to placebo, appeared to be 
more pronounced in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment at baseline compared to subjects 
with normal renal function or mild renal impairment, based on eGFR calculations per MDRD or CKD-EPI.  
Secondary endpoint: expanded MACE 
In line with the results for the primary MACE analysis, the estimated risk of experiencing an expanded 
MACE was reduced by 12% (HR: 0.88 [0.81; 0.96]95%CI) with liraglutide compared to placebo 
confirming the cardio-protective effect of liraglutide (Figure 5). All components of expanded MACE 
appeared to contribute to the reduced risk although the hazard ratio for hospitalisation for UAP was just 
below 1. A consistent pattern was observed when all events of expanded MACE were considered, 
including both first and recurrent events, i.e., the number and rate of events was lower with liraglutide 
(1721 events, 9.66 events per 100 PYO) compared to placebo (1958 events, 11.04 events per 100 PYO).

MACE by heart rate 
An increase in estimated mean heart rate of approximately 3 bpm was observed in the liraglutide group 
in trial 3748. Furthermore, categorical increases in heart rate of ≥ 10 bpm at visit 6 (month 6) were 
observed in a higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group (31%) compared to those in the 
placebo group (16%). Exploratory post hoc Cox analyses of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE and time to 
first hospitalisation for heart failure by categorical heart rate change at month 6 were performed. As the 
increase in heart rate with liraglutide occurs rapidly after treatment initiation, the analysis was based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 19/73 
 
  
  
 
the first available assessment of heart rate change post baseline which was at month 6. In both analyses, 
the results were consistent between the categorical heart rate change subgroups < 10 bpm and ≥ 10 
bpm, and the proportion of subjects with a first MACE was consistently lower in the liraglutide group 
compared to the placebo group (First MACE in subjects with Chg in HR <10 bmp: Lira 11.7% and placebo 
13.7%; First MACE in subjects with Chg in HR ≥10 bmp: Lira 12.5% and placebo 13.6%). Furthermore, 
no imbalance was seen in adverse events of arrhythmia as reported by the investigators.  
Secondary endpoint: all-cause death and non-cardiovascular death 
In trial 3748, the estimated risk of all-cause death was reduced by 15% in the liraglutide group compared 
to the placebo group (HR: 0.85 [0.74; 0.97]95%CI); see Figure 5. The difference was primarily driven by 
the lower frequency of cardiovascular deaths. The robustness was supported by a post hoc ‘on-treatment’ 
analysis of time to all-cause death and a post hoc tipping point analysis evaluating the potential impact of 
missing data. 
A reduction was also observed for the estimated risk of non-cardiovascular death with liraglutide 
compared to placebo (HR: 0.95 [0.77; 1.18]95%CI) (Figure 5). The most frequently reported causes of 
non-cardiovascular deaths were ‘malignancy’ and ‘infection (including sepsis)’ with no evident differences 
between the treatment groups. 
Microvascular endpoints 
The pre-specified secondary endpoint ‘time to first occurrence of a microvascular event’ counted first 
events of any of the 7 components of the microvascular composite (see Figure 6 for components). A 
single EAC-confirmed event could concomitantly fulfil more than one criterion defining either nephropathy 
or retinopathy events, thus, an event could count in more than one of the analyses of the individual 
components of the microvascular composite. 
The results of the main pre-specified time-to-event analyses for the microvascular composite and its 
components are summarised in Figure 6.  
The Cox analysis of ‘time to first occurrence of a microvascular event’ resulted in an estimated hazard 
ratio (liraglutide versus placebo) of 0.84 [0.73; 0.97]95%CI, corresponding to a 16% reduction in the risk 
of microvascular events in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group. The results were 
supported by a pre-specified sensitivity analysis that adjusted for additional covariates and a post hoc PP 
analysis. The difference between the treatment groups was driven by the nephropathy composite, with an 
estimated hazard ratio (liraglutide versus placebo) of 0.78 [0.67; 0.92]95%CI, corresponding to a 22% 
reduction in the risk of nephropathy events. The estimated hazard ratio for the retinopathy composite 
was 1.15 [0.87; 1.52]95%CI.  
In accordance with the results for the microvascular endpoint based on first events, the number and rate 
of EAC-confirmed microvascular events overall (first events and recurrent events) were lower in the 
liraglutide group than in the placebo group.

Glycaemic control 
Trial 3748 includes a number of sensitive subject populations for which there is currently no or limited 
clinical experience with liraglutide. In addition to subjects at high cardiovascular risk, this includes elderly 
subjects, subjects with severe renal impairment, subjects with heart failure (NYHA class I-III) and 
subjects treated with pre-mix insulin at baseline. 
HbA1c 
In trial 3748, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.7% in both treatment groups. In the liraglutide group, a 
substantial reduction in HbA1c was seen at 3 months, followed by a small, gradual increase throughout 
the rest of the trial (Figure 7, Table 3). In spite of the recommendations to optimise glycaemic control for 
all subjects, the placebo group did not achieve the same level of control on standard of care therapy and 
this was especially apparent during the first part of the trial where after the difference between the 
treatment groups diminished.   
The reduction in HbA1c was significantly greater with liraglutide than with placebo after 3 years of 
treatment (-1.16% versus -0.77%; estimated treatment difference of -0.4% [-0.45; -0.34] 95% CI); and 
the difference was maintained at end of treatment (-0.3% [-0.35; -0.23] 95% CI).  
Proportions of subjects in the liraglutide group achieving targets for HbA1c of <7%, 7.5% or 8% were in 
line with these results and were larger than those in the placebo group.

The beneficial effect of liraglutide on glycaemic control, as evaluated by HbA1c, was consistent across age 
groups, baseline renal function, and heart failure status according to NYHA classification (see Figure 8, 
Figure 9 and Figure 10). Furthermore, the estimated difference in HbA1c with liraglutide versus placebo 
was similar across the different subgroups.

Initiation of insulin and other antidiabetic therapies 
At baseline, 56.3% of subjects in the liraglutide group and 54.4% of subjects in the placebo group were 
insulin-naïve. During the trial, insulin was prescribed by the investigators as part of the recommended 
standard of care antidiabetic therapy to ensure improved glycaemic control. Insulin was initiated by a 
larger proportion of subjects in the placebo group than in the liraglutide group (43.2 vs 28.8% for 
placebo and liraglutide, respectively). A similar pattern was observed with respect to initiation of any new 
OAD (29.1 vs 21.7% for placebo and liraglutide, respectively) and initiation of insulin or any new OAD, 
respectively. 
Other efficacy endpoints 
A reduction in body weight was observed in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group at 3 
years (-2.7kg vs -0.5kg). The difference was sustained throughout the trial. 
A greater reduction in systolic blood pressure was seen in the liraglutide group compared to the 
placebo group at 3 years (-1.44 vs -0.25 mm Hg), while for diastolic blood pressure a smaller reduction 
was observed in the liraglutide group (-0.79 vs -1.37 mm Hg). 
Increases were observed for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, while the level 
of triglycerides was comparable between the treatment groups. The increases in TC and LDL were 
smaller for liraglutide as compared to placebo, while the increase in HDL was somewhat larger for 
liraglutide.

DEVOTE: A trial comparing cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec versus insulin 
glargine in subjects with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events 
Methods 
DEVOTE was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, treat-to-
target, controlled trial performed to confirm the cardiovascular safety of IDeg compared to IGlar when 
added to standard of care, in male and female subjects with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular events. 
The trial design is shown schematically in Figure 11. 
Figure 11 Trial design: Randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial 
The trial was event-driven and continued until a pre-specified number of 633 first EAC-confirmed 3-
component MACE (henceforth referred to as MACE) comprising cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction or non-fatal stroke were accrued. 
Study participants 
It was planned to randomise at least 7500 male and female subjects aged ≥50 years with established

Treatments 
Basal insulin 
All subjects could continue their pre-trial antidiabetic therapy except for the basal insulin component (if 
any) which was to be replaced by the IMPs i.e. IDeg or IGlar, (administered OD between dinner and 
bedtime). 
Insulin-naïve subjects initiated basal insulin at a dose of 10 units OD. Subjects receiving basal insulin OD 
were to be switched unit-to-unit from their previous basal insulin dose. Subjects receiving twice daily (or 
more) basal insulin were to be switched to an OD regimen and the pre-trial total basal insulin dose was to 
be reduced by 20–30%. No maximum insulin dose was specified as insulin doses were titrated according 
to individual plasma glucose values. 
Bolus insulin 
Subjects on pre-trial bolus insulin continued their therapy or switched to an equivalent dose of insulin 
aspart (IAsp) dispensed free of charge together with the IMP. 
Bolus insulin was initiated at the discretion of the investigator at a dose of 4 units per relevant meal. 
Switch from previous premixed/biphasic insulin regimen 
For subjects receiving premixed/biphasic insulin OD, the basal component was to be calculated and 
switched unit-to-unit to IMP OD. The bolus insulin component was to be calculated and switched unit-to-
unit to IAsp and given at the most appropriate meal at the investigator’s discretion. For subjects 
previously receiving premixed/biphasic insulin twice daily (or more), the total basal component was to be 
calculated, reduced by 20–30% and switched to IMP OD. The bolus component was to be calculated and 
switched to IAsp and dosed with the most appropriate meals at the investigator’s discretion. 
Insulin dose titration 
A treat-to-target trial design was employed for glycaemic control. To ensure treatment uniformity 
between the sites, as well as to ensure that subjects received optimal treatment, titration algorithms 
were developed specifying recommended dose adjustments at different plasma glucose levels, using the 
same glycaemic targets as in the phase 3a clinical programme. 
Concomitant medications 
Continued use and intensification with bolus insulin and other antidiabetic treatments was allowed during 
the course of the trial. Additional concomitant medications to treat serious adverse events and 
cardiovascular-related diseases were also permitted. Cardiovascular diseases and risk factors were to be 
treated according to local standard of care at the investigators’ discretion. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial was to confirm the cardiovascular safety of IDeg compared to that of 
IGlar. The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of IDeg on markers of glycaemic control and 
to assess safety on other parameters in subjects with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular events.

Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
All analyses and data presentations are based on the FAS population with the exception of one sensitivity 
analysis of the primary endpoint that used the PP. The FAS included all randomised subjects. The 
statistical evaluation of the FAS followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and subjects were to 
contribute to the evaluation “as randomised”. 
Primary analysis 
The primary endpoint (time from randomisation to first occurrence of EAC-confirmed 3-component MACE) 
was analysed using a Cox proportional hazard regression with treatment as factor. The HR and the 
corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval were estimated. Non-inferiority of IDeg to IGlar was 
considered confirmed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the HR was below 
1.3. Where a cardiovascular death was linked to an earlier fatal MI or stroke, the subject contributed to 
the analysis with time to the cardiovascular death. If a subject did not experience any MACE, the time 
was censored at the subject’s individual end-trial date. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the 
primary analysis, which included on-treatment and tipping point analyses, adjustments for baseline 
covariates, and where the primary analysis was repeated for the per-protocol analysis set. 
Secondary confirmatory analyses 
Provided that non-inferiority was confirmed for primary endpoint, the secondary confirmatory endpoint, 
‘Number of EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes’ was analysed using a negative binomial 
regression model with log-link function and the logarithm of the observation time as offset. The model 
included treatment as a fixed factor. Superiority of IDeg to IGlar was considered confirmed if the upper 
limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the rate ratio (RR [IDeg/IGlar]) was below 1.0. 
Provided that superiority of the number of EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes was confirmed 
for IDeg vs IGlar, the secondary confirmatory endpoint, ‘Occurrence of at least one EAC-confirmed severe 
hypoglycaemic episode within a subject’ was analysed using a logistic regression model, including 
treatment as a fixed factor. Superiority of IDeg to IGlar was considered confirmed if the upper limit of the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio (OR [IDeg/IGlar]) was below 1.0. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the secondary confirmatory analyses, which included on-
treatment and tipping point analyses (both secondary confirmatory analyses) and where the analysis of 
Assessment report

‘number of EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes’ was repeated with adjustment for baseline 
covariates, adjustment for baseline insulin treatment, and a truncation of the maximum number of severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes at 3 episodes per subject. 
Other secondary analyses 
Time from randomisation to first occurrence of an EAC-confirmed 4-point MACE (cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI and UAP requiring hospitalisation) as well the individual components of the 
4-point MACE were analysed using the same Cox regression model as the primary analysis. 
The treatment ratio between mean insulin doses at the 24 month visit was analysed using a mixed model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) within subjects using an unstructured residual covariance matrix among 
visits at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months of the study. Interactions between visit and treatment and 
with log(“baseline” dose) were included as fixed effects. Baseline dose was the first basal insulin dose 
reported by investigator for analyses of basal dose, whereas it was the total dose at visit 3 (Week 1) for 
analyses of total insulin dose. 
Two post hoc analyses were made where 1) change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 months and, 2) 
change from baseline in FPG after 24 months were analysed using an MMRM model within subjects using 
an unstructured residual covariance matrix among visits at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months. Interaction 
between visit and treatment, and interaction between visit and baseline were included as fixed effects.

Of the 8205 subjects screened, 7637 subjects were randomised (1:1) to treatment with IDeg (3818 
subjects) or IGlar (3819 subjects). Of the randomised subjects, 99.7% were exposed to treatment and 
more than 98% of subjects completed the trial (follow-up visit completed or died during trial). Primary 
outcome or vital status at end of trial was available for 99.9 % of participants randomised to IDeg and 
IGlar. 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well matched between subjects randomised to IDeg and 
IGlar. The overall mean age at baseline was 65.0 years and a total of 62.6% of the trial population were 
men. The trial population had a mean BMI at 33.6 kg/m2, ranging from 17.4 to 68.4 kg/m2. The mean 
HbA1c was 8.4% and the mean duration of diabetes was 16.4 years. The mean baseline FPG was 
9.5 mmol/L (171.65 mg/dL). Nearly 70% of the total population were recruited from sites in North 
America. 
At baseline 35.4% of subjects had moderate renal impairment and 2.8% of subjects had severe renal 
impairment. The mean eGFR at baseline was 68 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 37.4% had an eGFR less than 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Known severe renal impairment was an exclusion criterion for the trial; but current 
renal function was not known at the screening visit for all subjects. 
Moreover, 2.6% of subjects had hepatic impairment at baseline. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics in subgroups 
Demographics and baseline and diabetes characteristics were similar between IDeg and IGlar within 
subgroups defined by age (<65, ≥ 65, <75 or ≥75 years) as well as within subgroups defined by renal 
function (normal, mild impairment, moderate impairment and severe impairment). 
Medical history and concomitant illnesses 
Of the 7637 subjects randomised, 85.2% were aged ≥ 50 years with established cardiovascular disease 
or chronic kidney disease while 14.5 % were aged ≥ 60 years with risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
at baseline. The remaining 23 subjects (0.3%) had unknown cardiovascular disease risk at baseline. 
The use of cardiovascular and antidiabetic medication was well balanced between the two treatment 
groups at baseline. The majority of subjects were treated with cardiovascular medications at baseline, 
93.1% of subjects were on antihypertensive therapy and 82.2% were on lipid lowering drugs. 
Approximately 84% of subjects were treated with insulin at baseline and in addition to insulin, the most 
frequent antidiabetic medications at baseline were metformin (59.8% of subjects), followed by 
sulphonylureas (29.2% of subjects). Approximately 8% of subjects were treated with GLP1-RA at 
baseline. 
The number of subjects starting new cardiovascular and antidiabetic medication exclusively after baseline 
was similar across treatment groups.

Time to first EAC-confirmed MACE 
The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of EAC-confirmed MACE.  
A total of 681 first EAC-confirmed MACEs were reported in the trial, of which 325 occurred with IDeg and 
356 with IGlar (Table 6). The primary analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE resulted in an 
estimated HR of 0.91 [0.78; 1.06]95% CI for IDeg relative to IGlar (Figure 13). The upper bound of the 
95% CI was below 1.3, thus confirming non-inferiority of IDeg relative to IGlar with respect to 
cardiovascular safety. 
The distribution of the individual components of EAC-confirmed MACE was also similar between the two 
treatment groups. Of the total number of first EAC-confirmed MACE events, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction contributed with 45%, cardiovascular death with 34% and non-fatal stroke with 21%.

Multiple sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in order to assess the robustness of the primary analysis 
results. The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the result from the primary analysis. 
Number of EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes (confirmatory secondary endpoint 
[I]) 
The first confirmatory endpoint related to severe hypoglycaemia in the confirmatory testing hierarchy 
(confirmatory secondary endpoint [I]) was number of EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes. 
A total of 280 severe hypoglycaemic episodes were confirmed for the IDeg group vs 472 for the IGlar 
group (Table 7). The corresponding confirmatory secondary analysis resulted in an estimated RR of 0.60 
Assessment report

[0.48; 0.76]95% CI (p<0.001) for IDeg relative to IGlar, thus confirming superiority of IDeg relative to 
IGlar with respect to number of EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes.  
Table 7 EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes - summary - FAS 
Various sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in order to assess the robustness of the confirmatory 
secondary analysis results. The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results from 
the confirmatory secondary analysis. 
Occurrence of at least one EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode within a subject - 
confirmatory secondary endpoint (II) 
The second confirmatory endpoint related to severe hypoglycaemia in the confirmatory testing hierarchy 
(confirmatory secondary endpoint [II]) was occurrence of at least one EAC-confirmed severe 
hypoglycaemic episode within a subject. 
A total of 187 (4.9%) subjects in the IDeg group and 252 (6.6%) subjects in the IGlar group experienced 
at least one EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode (Table 7). The corresponding confirmatory 
secondary analysis resulted in an estimated OR of 0.73 [0.60; 0.89]95% CI (p=0.001) for IDeg relative to 
IGlar , thus confirming superiority of IDeg in relation to IGlar with respect to the occurrence of at least 
one EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode within a subject.  
Sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in order to assess the robustness of the confirmatory secondary 
analysis results. The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results from the 
confirmatory secondary analysis. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Change in HbA1c from baseline 
At baseline, mean HbA1c was 8.4% in both treatment groups. Mean HbA1c levels in both treatment 
groups decreased during the initial 3 months and remained relatively constant thereafter. At month 24, 
mean HbA1c had decreased to 7.5% in both treatment groups, corresponding to a mean change from 
baseline of approximately 0.9%-point.  
Change in FPG from baseline 
At baseline, mean FPG was 9.4 mmol/L (169.8 mg/dL) in the IDeg group and 9.6 mmol/L (173.5 mg/dL) 
in the IGlar group. In both treatment groups, mean FPG levels decreased during the first 12 months of 
the trial, whereafter the levels were maintained up to month 24. At month 24, mean FPG was 7.1 mmol/L 
(128.3 mg/dL) in the IDeg group compared to 7.5 mmol/L (135.8 mg/dL) in the IGlar group, 
corresponding to a mean decrease of 2.2 mmol/L (39.9 mg/dL) with IDeg and 1.9 mmol/L (34.9 mg/dL) 
with IGlar.

Self-measured plasma glucose measurements 
Pre-breakfast SMPG 
A similar reduction in pre-breakfast SMPG was observed between the IDeg and IGlar treatment groups. In 
both treatment groups, pre-breakfast SMPG decreased steadily during the initial 6 months of treatment 
followed by lower but continuous improvements throughout the remaining treatment period. At month 
24, the mean lowest pre-breakfast SMPG value was 5.4 mmol/L (97.1 mg/dL) in the IDeg group and 5.3 
mmol/L (95.8 mg/dL) in the IGlar group. 
8-point SMPG profiles 
There were no major differences between the IDeg and IGlar groups in the 8-point SMPG profile over one 
day at month 12, month 24 and at the end-treatment visit. A similar decrease in the mean of the 8-point 
SMPG profile from month 12 to month 24 was observed in both treatment groups. 
Insulin dose 
IMP dose 
Analysis of the basal insulin dose at month 24 showed an estimated treatment ratio of 1.038, 
corresponding to a small (by 3.8%) but statistically significantly higher basal insulin dose for the IDeg 
group compared to the IGlar group. Analysis with adjustment for additional baseline covariates showed a 
similar result. 
Bolus insulin dose 
There were no major differences in bolus insulin dose between the IDeg and IGlar groups at baseline, 
month 24 and at the last observed value (representing the dose at the last scheduled visit prior to the 
end-treatment visit). 
Total insulin dose 
Analysis of the total insulin dose at month 24 showed a non-significant estimated treatment ratio of 1.001 
between IDeg and IGlar. Analysis with adjustment for additional baseline covariates showed a similar 
result. 
Comparison of efficacy results in subgroups 
The consistency in treatment effect on glycaemic control was explored across subgroups by age and renal 
function. 
HbA1c by age group 
At baseline, a total of 3955 trial subjects were aged ≥65 years, which amounted to 51.8% of the total 
trial population, and 819 (10.7%) subjects were aged ≥75 years, thus ensuring significant exposure in 
geriatric subjects. The mean change in HbA1c between IDeg and IGlar was similar across age groups 
defined by age <65, ≥65, <75, and ≥75 years at baseline. 
HbA1c by renal function 
A significant proportion of subjects had varying degrees of renal impairment, with more than a third of 
the trial population having moderate or severe renal impairment. There were no major differences in 
HbA1c reduction between the IDeg and IGlar groups in patients with severe, moderate and mild renal 
impairment. Furthermore, the change in HbA1c in patients with renal impairment was comparable to that 
seen in patients with normal renal function.

LEADER Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular

EudraCT number – 2009-012201-19 
EX2211-3748 
LEADER was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial in males and females with T2DM and high risk of 
cardiovascular disease. Liraglutide and placebo were administered in addition to 
standard of care therapy (determined at the investigator’s discretion), with the option 
of adding glucose-lowering or cardiovascular medication to achieve (individualised) 
guideline targets for glycaemic control, blood pressure and lipids. In addition 
recommendations for life style interventions and antiplatelet therapy were issued. The 
trial consisted of a screening visit followed by a 2 to 3-week run-in period during which 
eligible subjects received placebo. Subjects who met the randomisation criteria and 
could adhere to the injection regimen were randomised (1:1) to liraglutide or placebo 
for a treatment period of 42 to 60 months and a 30-day post-treatment follow-up 
period. Subjects were scheduled to attend the sites 1, 3 and 6 months after 
randomisation and then every 6 months. 
The duration of the trial was driven by both number of MACEs and by time. Thus, trial 
3748 ended once all subjects had had a minimum treatment period of 42 months (plus 
a follow-up period of 30 days), and once at least 611 EAC-confirmed MACEs were 
recorded. The minimum period of 42 months was defined in order to provide data on 
long-term exposure to liraglutide and allow assessments of relevant safety parameters 
of interest. Trial 3748 included a recruitment period of 18 months, resulting in a 
maximum treatment period of 60 months. 
An external, independent event adjudication committee (EAC) was constituted for this 
trial to perform ongoing adjudication and assessment of potential major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACEs), deaths and predefined medical events of special 
interest (MESIs) in a blinded manner. An independent, external Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) was constituted for the trial to oversee safety and perform ongoing 
safety surveillance at pre-defined time points as well as ad hoc. The DMC had access 
to unblinded data. A Steering Committee (StC) comprised of academic members (11) 
and employees of the sponsor (4) provided scientific and academic leadership for the 
trial.

This trial was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double 
blind, parallel group, controlled trial 
conducted to confirm the cardiovascular safety of IDeg compared to IGlar 
when added to standard of care in male and 
female subjects with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular events. 
The trial was event-driven and trial closure was initiated when it was secured 
that the pre-specified number of first 
EAC-confirmed major cardiovascular adverse events (MACEs) (633 events) 
would be accrued. MACE was a 
3-component endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction and non-fatal stroke

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Trial 3748 
Trial 3748 (LEADER) was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial performed to determine the effect on cardiovascular outcomes and safety of liraglutide 
versus placebo. Both liraglutide and placebo were used in addition to standard of care therapy to ensure 
scientific rigour of the comparison.  
The protocol of the study and the amendments to the protocol were agreed by CHMP. MACE-3 was the 
primary endpoint for the LEADER trial, in accordance with the EMA guidance (Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus 
(CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1)). An expanded MACE, including hospitalisation for unstable angina, coronary 
revascularisation and hospitalisation for heart failure in addition to MACE-3, was a secondary outcome 
measure. These are also acceptable outcome measures. MACE-3 was assessed for both non-inferiority 
and superiority. 
Inclusion criteria allowed for a population with T2DM at very high risk for CV events, as patients were 
included ≥50 years with “established cardiovascular disease”, or ≥60 years with only “risk factors for 
Assessment report

cardiovascular disease”. Most subjects that were actually included were from Europe (35%) or North 
America (30%) and had a mean age of 64 years. The number of European subjects is considered 
sufficient and is representative for the European T2DM population with documented atherosclerotic 
disease. In total 45% of subjects were on insulin treatment at baseline, out of which 35% used 
intermediate or long acting insulin. This subpopulation could be of relevance for the current application. 
The statistical analysis plan has been discussed and was considered acceptable by CHMP before trial 
completion. The analysis sets are considered acceptable. There are no concerns regarding randomisation 
or blinding or group differences in baseline characteristics. An analysis excluding the 111 protocol 
violations indicated that the primary endpoint was not affected by these protocol violations. 
Trial 4080 
The DEVOTE trial was a long-term, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, treat-to-target, controlled 
trial with the aim of confirming the cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec (IDeg). The study design, 
including primary and secondary objectives and endpoints, was adequate. Insulin glargine (IGlar) was 
chosen as comparator which is endorsed, since CV safety data is available showing that IGlar does not 
alter the risk of CV events compared to standard-of-care.  
The key inclusion and exclusion criteria aimed at recruiting patients at high risk of CV events. Notably, 
patients with eGFR < 30 were to be excluded. The demographic and baseline characteristics were as 
expected for a T2DM population at high CV risk.  The majority of patients included were patients aged 
≥ 50 years with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. As expected the vast 
majority of patients were treated with cardiovascular medications at baseline. A high proportion of 
patients used basal insulin at baseline, in line with a long duration of diabetes at inclusion. Only about 8% 
of subjects were treated with GLP1-RA at baseline, thus the subpopulation most relevant to this 
application is verylimited. There were no imbalances between treatment groups. 
Patients were randomised to treatment with either IDeg or IGlar. The trial was double-blinded. Adequate 
treatment algorithms were in place for the adjustment of both basal and bolus insulin doses to ensure 
uniformity between sites when titrating to target. 
The statistical methods applied were adequate as were the sample size calculations. The analysis sets are 
agreed with. As this was a non-inferiority trial, the sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint that used 
the PP set is of special interest. 
Three amendments were made to the protocol, none of which are considered to affect the outcome or 
interpretation of the data. The MAH has accounted for the important protocol deviations. The subject-
level protocol deviations were similarly distributed between the IDeg and IGlar groups, overall, as well as 
within each category and subcategory. The study was well conducted and the protocol deviations are not 
considered to have an overall impact on trial conduct, subject safety or data integrity.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the following, focus is on the data of relevance for the current application. 
Trial 3748 
The primary endpoint (MACE-3) showed superiority of liraglutide over placebo. All three components of 
MACE-3 appeared to contribute to the reduction, most notably CV-death (HR 0.78). Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the results of the primary analysis. Kaplan-Meier plots of time to first EAC-confirmed events 
showed that differences in MACE and its components were observable from week 10-20 onwards. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 39/73 
 
  
  
Other secondary endpoints were all-cause death and non-cardiovascular death. All-cause death was 
reduced by liraglutide treatment, while only a favourable trend was observed for non-CV death. Thus, the 
reduction in all-cause death was mainly due to a reduction in CV-death. 
To explore the possibility that censoring due to non-CV death influenced the primary analysis, post hoc 
analyses were performed of the time to all-cause death, MI and stroke and of the time to CV death, MI 
and stroke adjusted for non-CV death. The results of these analyses were similar to the primary analysis. 
Furthermore, no difference was observed in an analysis of time to non-CV death censoring for CV death, 
MI and stroke. Therefore it is unlikely that the primary analysis is biased by censoring for non-CV death. 
Exploratory analyses of the primary endpoint were performed in subgroups of sex, age, BMI, HbA1c, 
duration of diabetes, race, ethnicity, cardiovascular risk group, heart failure (NYHA class I-III), severe 
and moderate renal failure and antidiabetic medication at baseline. Results for most subgroups were 
consistent with the overall effect on MACE, but there were 2 subgroups that showed a hazard ratio 
above 1. First, although no statistically significant interaction was found between treatment and region, 
for Region North America hazard ration was above 1. There were baseline differences between US and 
European participants. Results for Europe, the most relevant region for this application, were consistent 
with the overall effects on MACE: HR 0.81 (0.68-0.98) for liraglutide vs placebo. Second, the hazard ratio 
was above 1 for subjects aged >60 with only one cardiovascular risk factor for CV. A number of post-hoc 
analyses were performed for the cardiovascular risk groups. These did not reveal an explanation for 
the observed difference. The difference might be due to uncertainties associated with the estimate, as the 
subgroup of subjects aged ≥60 years with only risk factors for CV disease accounted for a relatively small 
proportion of the total trial population  (~20%) and MACEs (~10%) observed in the trial.  
The subgroup relevant to this application is patients on concomitant treatment with liraglutide and basal 
insulin, preferably IDeg. In total 45% of subjects were on insulin treatment at baseline. Only 23% of the 
study population was treated with a combination of long-acting insulin (insulin glargine or insulin detemir) 
and liraglutide. The subgroups included in the prespecified analysis were patients on insulin+OADs and 
patients on insulin only. For both these groups the point estimate for MACE-3 was below 1 but the 
confidence interval includes 1 for both subgroups. The MAH has provided a subgroup analysis which 
includes all patients on concomitant liraglutide and basal insulin therapy. Analysis of time to first EAC-
confirmed MACE resulted in an estimated HR of 0.82 [0.66; 1.03]95%CI for liraglutide relative to 
placebo. However, no patient in the LEADER trial was exposed to the combination of liraglutide and 
insulin degludec. 
Exploratory analyses according to heart failure (yes/no) indicated similar results in favour of liraglutide 
as overall effect on MACE. However, analyses according to heart failure class revealed slightly different 
results. There were no notable differences between treatment groups with respect to the distribution of 
EAC-confirmed expanded MACE, deaths, AEs (SAEs and non-serious MESIs) or hypoglycaemic episodes 
across the subgroups for HF status; however, there was a numerical increase in non-fatal MI, non-fatal 
stroke and HF hospitalisations in patients with NYHA III at baseline. This is considered a chance finding 
related to the low number of patients (lira: 108 pbo: 106) and expanded MACE events (lira: 82 pbo: 75) 
in the group with NYHA III at baseline. 
In the LEADER trial, liraglutide or placebo was added to standard care. At baseline, some imbalances 
were present in use of cardiovascular medication. Sensitivity analyses showed that HRs were similar 
to the primary HR, and thus it is unlikely that primary results are biased by differences in cardiovascular 
medication. An interaction was observed for treatment and renal function: liraglutide performed better 
with respect to MACE in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR<60) as compared to 
subjects with normal renal function or mildly reduced renal function (eGFR>60). A beneficial effect was 
however observed in all subgroups of renal function with the exception of patients with eGFR 75-<90

ml/min/1.73 m2. No specific pattern is observed and, there is no obvious pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic reason to believe that the effect should differ based solely on renal function. 
Until now the therapeutic experience with liraglutide in patients with severe renal impairment was limited. 
In this study experience has been extended with 224 patients (117 liraglutide, 107 placebo). 
Mean HbA1c at baseline was rather high: 8.7%. Subgroup analyses showed that there was no interaction 
with treatment effect and HbA1c.  
In line with observations from the liraglutide for T2DM development programme, an increase in estimated 
mean heart rate was observed in the liraglutide group in trial 3748. It has been suggested that small 
increases in resting heart rate may be associated with an increased oxygen demand, which may result in 
heart failure, MACE, or even increased mortality. The exploratory post hoc analyses performed, showed 
results consistent with the primary analysis. Furthermore, no imbalance was seen in adverse events of 
arrhythmia as reported by the investigators. Hence according to these data, the increase in resting heart 
rate was not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including arrhythmias. 
Microvascular safety was evaluated using composite microvascular, nephropathy and retinopathy 
endpoints. A positive effect, in favour of liraglutide, was observed for the composite microvascular 
endpoint, showing a reduction in the risk of microvascular effects events in the liraglutide group 
compared to the placebo group: 355/4668 (7.6%) events in the liraglutide group versus 416/4672 
(8.9%) in the placebo group (HR 0.84 [0.73-0.97] 95%CI). The difference between the treatment groups 
was driven by the nephropathy composite with an estimated hazard ratio (liraglutide versus placebo) of 
0.78 [0.67; 0.92]95%CI, corresponding to a 22% reduction in the risk of nephropathy events (liraglutide 
268/4668 (5.7%) events, placebo 337/4672 (7.2%) events). The reduction in nephropathy was mainly 
due to a reduction in persistent macroalbuminuria.  
In contrast, no reduction in retinopathy was seen: liraglutide 106/4668 (2.3%) events vs placebo 
92/4672 (2.0%) events. The imbalance in the retinopathy composite was due to an imbalance in vitreous 
haemorrhage (32 vs 22 subjects in the liraglutide group vs placebo; total events liraglutide: 32 subjects, 
44 events, 0.25 events/100 PYO versus placebo: 22 subjects, 23 events, 0.13 events/PYO), (HR 1.45 
[0.84; 2.50]). The MAH considers a causal relationship with liraglutide treatment unlikely, as the 
incidence of vitreous haemorrhage events was low, and there was no signal in non-clinical and clinical 
trials with liraglutide. The increase was appearing within the first 16 weeks of treatment. In patients with 
type 1 diabetes an association is reported between rapid glucose lowering and worsening of retinopathy. 
If this association is applicable to the effects of liraglutide, this would be reassuring. In type 1 diabetes, 
the early worsening of retinopathy is transient, largely resolving after 1 to 2 years, and there is clear 
evidence of benefit from glucose lowering in the following years. The fact that the increased risk of 
retinopathy with liraglutide does not decrease in the course of the 5 year trial is worrisome and suggests 
that other mechanisms than rapid glucose lowering may play a role. For semaglutide, another GLP-1 RA, 
also an increase of diabetic retinopathy was observed, according to published data.1 Therefore, it is 
possible that there is a class effect. No firm conclusions are possible from the LEADER trial due to the low 
number of events. No signal was detected in other clinical trials with liraglutide, although it should be 
remarked that retinopathy was not actively looked for. Retinopathy will be monitored in the PSURs for 
liraglutide.  
Glycaemic control, measured by HbA1c, was evaluated for the total study population and for a number 
of subgroups. HbA1c target was <7%. For the total study population, the reduction in HbA1c was greater 
with liraglutide than with placebo after 3 years of treatment (-1.16% versus -0.77%; estimated

treatment difference of -0.4% [-0.45; -0.34] 95% CI); and the difference was maintained at end of 
treatment (-0.3% [-0.35; -0.23]95% CI).  
Although investigators were instructed to provide standard of care treatment for antidiabetic therapy 
throughout the treatment period, the placebo group did not achieve the same level of control. This may 
be partly explained by the fact that the treatment options for subjects in the placebo group were limited 
by the fact that use of incretin-based therapies was not allowed. 
The results were consistent across the subgroups of age, renal function, NYHA classes and use of premix 
insulin at baseline, and the estimated difference in HbA1c vs placebo was similar across subgroups. Thus, 
reductions in HbA1c with liraglutide versus placebo were observed in sub-populations, for which there are 
currently limited therapeutic experience with liraglutide, including subjects aged ≥75 years, subjects with 
severe renal impairment and subjects with heart failure according to NYHA class I, II and III. Liraglutide 
was also associated with similar reductions in HbA1c in subjects treated with or without pre-mix insulin at 
baseline and the following 26 weeks confirming the effectiveness of liraglutide in combination with pre 
mix insulin. 
Other efficacy endpoints were initiation of insulin and antidiabetic therapies, body weight, SBP and 
DBP. These were all in favour of liraglutide. 
In both treatment groups small increases were observed for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL 
cholesterol, while the level of triglycerides was comparable between treatment groups. The increases in 
TC and LDL were smaller for liraglutide as compared to placebo, while the increase in HDL was somewhat 
larger for liraglutide. It is not agreed with the MAH that results are in favour of liraglutide. It is better to 
say that, compared to placebo; results for liraglutide are less negative. 
The mechanism behind the cardiovascular benefit with liraglutide is unclear. The MAH suggest a direct 
effect of liraglutide on MACE. However, liraglutide was associated with statistically significantly reductions 
in established cardiovascular risk factors such as HbA1c, SBP, body weight and LDL cholesterol compared 
to placebo. These benefits might contribute to the observed effect on MACE. Further, it is of importance 
that a significantly higher proportion of patients in the placebo group during the study initiated 
antidiabetic medications, including SUs, TZDs and insulin, compared to patients in the liraglutide group. 
Both SUs and TZDs have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular harm. In fact analysis 
excluding patients using SUs or TZDs at baseline only showed a borderline significant results of liraglutide 
on MACE (HR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.73, 1.00). Although, it is acknowledged that previous data suggest that 
liraglutide also has a direct effect on the atherosclerotic process, a direct effect of liraglutide on 
cardiovascular death is not evident from the LEADER trial. More insight in the mode of action would be 
important to optimize use of liraglutide in subgroups. 
At present, it must be concluded that the mechanism behind the beneficial cardiovascular effect of 
liraglutide remains largely unknown and further non-clinical and clinical studies are needed to elucidate 
the mechanism. 
Trial 4080 
Non-inferiority with regards to the primary endpoint was shown for IDeg vs IGlar (HR 0.91 [0.78; 
1.06]95% CI). The outcome was robust and supported by the sensitivity analyses, including the analysis in 
the PP set. Events occurred evenly distributed over time for both treatments and the three components of 
MACE (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and CV-death) were equally distributed for both treatments. 
The first confirmatory secondary endpoint (number of EAC-confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes) showed 
that IDeg was superior to IGlar (RR 0.60 [0.48; 0.76]95% CI (p<0.001)). The second confirmatory 
secondary endpoint (occurrence of at least one EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode within a 
subject) also showed that IDeg was superior to IGlar with a reduced risk of experiencing hypoglycaemia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 42/73 
 
  
  
(OR 0.73 [0.60; 0.89]95% CI (p=0.001)). The results for both endpoints were supported by the sensitivity 
analyses performed and are deemed robust. 
Other antidiabetic treatments, including bolus insulin, were allowed during the course of the trial without 
restrictions. Cardiovascular diseases and risk factors were to be treated according to local standard of 
care. There were no imbalances between treatment groups with regards to medications initiated after 
study entry. 
There was no difference in the change in HbA1c from baseline between treatments. This is as expected 
provided that both treatments were titrated to target. A post-hoc analysis showed no difference between 
treatments. There was a slightly more pronounced decrease in FPG with IDeg compared to IGlar. There 
were no differences between treatments in the pre-breakfast SMPG or 8-point SMPG profiles. Thus the 
difference observed in FPG was not confirmed by the SMPG. 
At 24 months, slightly higher doses of IDeg were observed compared to IGlar, however at the last visit 
before EOT, no difference was observed. There were no major differences in bolus doses or total insulin 
dose between groups. 
Known severe renal impairment was an exclusion criterion but the MAH states that current renal function 
was not known at screening visit for all patients. Subjects who were non-compliant with any of the 
eligibility criteria were not to be randomised. However, if there were no safety concerns, treatment with 
trial products could be continued or resumed at the discretion of the investigator after consulting the 
sponsor’s global medical expert. This resulted in the inclusion of 214 patients with eGFR<30 (2.8%), 
equally distributed between the two treatment groups (108 patients in the IDeg group and 106 patients 
in the IGlar group). 
There was no difference in the treatment effect in terms of HbA1c reduction between IDeg and IGlar in 
the subgroups by age or renal function. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The LEADER trial was a well-designed and well-conducted CV outcome trial which showed superiority of 
liraglutide over placebo in the primary endpoint of 3-point MACE. The results were mainly driven by a 
decrease in CV-death. Secondary endpoints showed a reduction in expanded MACE, with (non-significant) 
decreases in non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospitalisation for heart failure and coronary 
revascularisation. No effects on hospitalisation due to UAP were observed. Furthermore, a reduction in 
nephropathy was observed with liraglutide treatment. No firm conclusions can be drawn with respect to 
retinopathy for which an imbalance in favour of placebo was observed.  
The data from the DEVOTE trial show that IDeg did not alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV 
mortality when compared to IGlar since non-inferiority could be established. IGlar has previously been 
shown not to alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV mortality when compared to standard of care.  
In the clinical program supporting the MAA, IDeg was shown to have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia 
compared to IGlar in patients with T2DM. This was confirmed in this study where the number of severe 
hypoglycaemias as well as the risk of experience a severe hypoglycaemia was significantly lower with 
IDeg than with IGlar. 
Both studies contribute with important data on the cardiovascular safety for each of the two components 
of IDegLira; however extrapolation of these outcomes to the combination has not been justified. 
Therefore the proposed reference to the effect on cardiovascular events in section 4.1 is not accepted nor 
is the inclusion of study data in section 5.1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 43/73 
 
  
  
Nevertheless, the LEADER trial contributes with important data on the liraglutide component of IDegLira, 
e.g. information on the use in special populations and conditions, that have been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
With the current application, safety data from two large cardiovascular outcome studies have been 
submitted. In these studies the effect on cardiovascular safety of the monocomponents (liraglutide and 
IDeg, respectively) of Xultophy (IDegLira) was investigated. Thus no data on the combination has been 
provided. The safety data has resulted in changes both to the product information and RMPs for the 
monocomponents. Some of these changes may also be relevant for the combination why these data are 
presented in the following.  
Trial 3748 
The most frequently reported AEs with the current indication of Victoza (liraglutide) are gastrointestinal 
adverse events (nausea and diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia). Headache 
and nasopharyngitis are also common. Furthermore, hypoglycaemia is common, and very common when 
liraglutide is used in combination with a sulfonylurea. 
In trial 3748, only SAEs (serious adverse events) and MESIs (medical event of special interest) were 
systematically collected and the present evaluation is based on these events only. The selective and 
targeted approach to safety data collection was in line with the FDA guidance on safety data collection in 
late stage premarket and post-approval clinical investigations. No additional safety concerns were 
identified based on review of non-serious AEs not systematically collected (i.e., non-serious, non-MESI 
events).  
CV outcomes form the primary endpoint of this trial and are therefore described in the efficacy section of 
this document. Microvascular endpoints, although defined as safety endpoints in the protocol, are also 
discussed in the efficacy section above. 
MESIs discussed in this section are: neoplasms and calcitonin, thyroid disease, pancreatitis, acute 
gallstone disease, hypoglycaemia and immunogenicity. 
In addition, safety in specific populations is discussed.  
Trial 4080 
As the safety profiles of IDeg and IGlar are well characterised and the trial was designed to evaluate 
cardiovascular outcomes data, a selective and targeted approach was used to collect safety data. The 
most important and common AE with insulin treatment is hypoglycaemia. 
The following types of events were systematically collected: all SAEs, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of investigational product, medication errors leading to an SAE 
and adverse events related to technical complaints. Data on neoplasms was also collected and was 
subject to external classification. 
CV outcomes form the primary endpoint of this trial and are therefore described in the efficacy section of 
this document. Hypoglycaemia constituted the confirmatory secondary endpoints and is also briefly 
discussed in the efficacy section but some additional data is discussed in this section. Data on neoplasms 
is also presented. 
In addition, safety in specific populations is discussed.

Patient exposure 
Trial 3748 
The median time of observation in the trial was 3.84 years (including follow-up period) and the total 
median exposure time to the trial product was 3.52 years. The total mean proportion of time on trial 
product was 83%. In the liraglutide group slightly more subjects had one or more drug holidays 
(accumulated days off drug) compared to subjects in the placebo group (Table 11). Overall, 85% of the 
total liraglutide exposure in the trial was to the 1.8 mg/day dose. 
More than 70% of total subjects were exposed for 90% or more of the observation time (as assessed by 
the PYE/PYO ratio) indicating that the majority of subjects continued treatment with trial product during 
the trial period. A smaller fraction of subjects (~ 6% in both arms) were exposed for less than 10% of the 
observation time, indicating that they discontinued during the initial phase of the trial.

FAS: full analysis set, N: Number of subjects, %: Proportion of subjects, Years in trial are calculated from 
randomisation date to last contact (phone or visit), PYO: patient years of observation. Exposure is calculated from 
first drug date to last drug date or last visit date (whichever comes first) - only time periods with a dose. If last 
drug date is missing it is substituted with withdrawal date. 
Trial 4080 
Observation time for each subject was defined as the time from randomisation to last visit, last EAC-
confirmed MACE or death before last patient last visit, whichever came first. 
The total number of patient years of observation (PYO) in the trial was 15125 years, with a median 
observation time of 1.99 years. The total number of patient years of exposure (PYE) to investigational 
trial product was 13522 years with a median of 1.83 years. A similar distribution of observation time and 
exposure time was seen between treatment groups (IDeg vs IGlar) (Table 12). Treatment pauses and the 
≥30-day safety follow-up period from the end of treatment visit to the follow-up visit were included as 
observation time (PYO) but not as exposure time (PYE). Hence, the total exposure time (PYE) was less

than the total observation time (PYO). In total, 85.2% of subjects were exposed for ≥90% of the planned 
exposure time.

Adverse events 
Trial 3748 
The overall adverse event profile with liraglutide in trial 3748 resembled that observed in the clinical 
development programme for with T2DM, albeit the incidence of especially deaths and cardiovascular 
events was higher, reflecting a population at very high risk of cardiovascular disease.  
In general, the proportion of subjects with SAEs and non-serious MESIs and the rates of such events were 
similar between the treatment groups, whereas the rate of fatal events was lower in the liraglutide group 
(Table 13). A higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group had 
SAEs and non-serious MESIs evaluated as being probably or possibly related to trial product by the 
investigator and events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were also more common with 
liraglutide. These differences were driven by non–serious MESIs and were not apparent when evaluating 
SAEs separately.

Neoplasms  
Neoplasms including MTC were to be addressed as a post-marketing commitment for Victoza.  
Furthermore, specific malignancies were addressed in alignment with regulatory concerns raised for the 
class of incretin-based therapies (pancreatic cancer) and specific imbalances noted during the regulatory 
review of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management (Saxenda; breast and colorectal neoplasms). Finally, 
neoplasms by insulin use were addressed to provide further insights on previous clinical trial findings with 
liraglutide in combination with insulin detemir (NN2211-1842). 
Neoplasms (overall, benign and malignant) 
The proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed neoplasms in the liraglutide and placebo groups were 
10.1% versus 9.0% for overall neoplasms, 3.6% versus 3.1% for benign neoplasms and 6.3% versus 
6.0% for malignant neoplasms (Table 14). Cox analyses applied post hoc showed no statistically 
significant difference between the treatment groups across these neoplasm categories.

Of the EAC-confirmed benign neoplasms, benign colorectal neoplasms (discussed further below) were the 
most common type occurring in both treatment groups. A wide variety of EAC-confirmed malignant 
neoplasms occurred in both treatment groups including malignant non-melanoma of the skin and 
malignant breast (women), prostate, lung and colorectal neoplasms which are among the most common

malignancies in the general/T2DM populations. As estimated by post hoc Cox analyses (liraglutide versus 
placebo), no statistically significant treatment difference was observed for any specific types of benign 
neoplasms. For malignant neoplasms, the point estimate for the hazard ratios for the various types were 
distributed on both sides of the line of unity with a statistically significant treatment difference observed 
only for malignant prostate neoplasms and leukaemia (both favouring liraglutide). Some of the malignant 
neoplasm types included only few subjects with confirmed events which are reflected in very broad 95% 
confidence intervals.  
Apart from the predefined malignancy types (i.e., thyroid, pancreatic, breast and colorectal) additional 
evaluations of other types were applied to identify other potential safety concerns related to liraglutide. 
Malignancy types which underwent a more in-depth evaluation were: malignant non-melanoma skin 
neoplasms, melanoma of the skin, hepatic or biliary neoplasms and kidney or renal pelvis neoplasms. 
In the following, only data on malignant melanoma, thyroid neoplasms and pancreatic neoplasms is 
presented. 
Malignant melanoma 
Number of subjects with EAC-confirmed pre-malignant or malignant melanoma was low: 20 events in 
19 subjects in the liraglutide group and 9 events in 9 subjects in the placebo group. As expected, the 
majority of events occurred at sun-exposed skin areas and in White subjects. Of note, among subjects 
with an EAC-confirmed pre-malignant or malignant skin melanoma neoplasm, more subjects in the 
liraglutide group had risk factors such as previous UV exposure and/or a medical history of skin cancer as 
compared to the placebo group. Events had onset shortly after randomisation and occurred at comparable 
rates in the two treatment groups until around month 18 into the trial. After this, events continued to 
accrue at a similar and constant rate in the liraglutide group, whereas, for the placebo group, only 
2 additional events occurred at a late stage during the course of the trial. The MAH is of the opinion that a 
causal relationship between liraglutide and skin melanoma neoplasms is not likely. 
Thyroid neoplasms and calcitonin 
Events of EAC-confirmed thyroid neoplasms (overall or malignant) occurred at comparable low incidences 
for the two treatment groups (overall thyroid neoplasms: 0.1% in both treatment groups; malignant 
thyroid neoplasms: 0.1% in both treatment groups. No cases of MTC, a very rare cancer type in humans, 
were identified in liraglutide-treated subjects (1 MTC occurred in the placebo group). Consistently, there 
was no indication of a liraglutide effect on blood calcitonin concentrations (a clinical biomarker for MTC 
and a potential predictor of C-cell neoplasia at levels ≥50 ng/L). EAC-confirmed thyroid neoplasms of 
papillary origin (malignant events) were well-balanced between the treatment groups (5 and 4 events, 
respectively, in the liraglutide and placebo groups.  
Pancreatic neoplasms 
The incidence of EAC-confirmed pancreatic neoplasms was low in both the liraglutide (0.3%) and the 
placebo (0.1%) groups. Based on low numbers, EAC-confirmed malignant pancreatic neoplasms occurred 
disproportionately more in the liraglutide group (13 subjects with 14 events; 0.08 events per 100 PYO) 
compared to the placebo group (5 subjects with 5 events; 0.03 events per 100 PYO). There was one EAC-
confirmed pre-malignant pancreatic neoplasm event occurring in the liraglutide group. 
Thyroid disease 
In trial 3748, the proportion of subjects with events of thyroid disease was similar in the liraglutide group 
(4.2%) and in the placebo group (4.1%) and the event rates for the most frequently reported preferred 
terms (PTs) (‘hypothyroidism’, ‘blood calcitonin increased’ and ‘goitre’) were low and similar between 
treatment groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 48/73 
 
  
  
Although the numbers were low, the proportion of subjects with events of thyroid disease and the rate of 
such events among subjects with a medical history of thyroid disease were higher in the liraglutide group 
(7.5%) compared to the placebo group (5.8%). This was also noted in the liraglutide T2DM clinical 
development programme. The imbalance was driven by events of ‘goitre’ (liraglutide, 16 events; placebo 
6 events), while no imbalances were observed with respect to the proportion of subjects with ‘thyroid 
neoplasm’ or ‘blood calcitonin elevated’ between liraglutide and placebo or in the rates of such events. 
‘Goitre’ events occurred throughout the trial in subjects with a medical history of thyroid disease in the 
liraglutide group with an approximate constant although slightly higher rate than for the placebo group 
and with no events reported in the placebo group after approximately 22 months. Thus no new findings 
were observed for liraglutide and thyroid disease. 
Pancreatitis 
In trial 3748, the proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed acute pancreatitis and the rates of such 
events were comparable between the liraglutide group (0.4%; 0.11 events per 100 PYO) and the placebo 
group (0.5%; 0.19 events per 100 PYO) and the majority of events were classified as ‘mild acute 
pancreatitis’ based on the revised Atlanta classification (Table 15). In addition, in subjects with a medical 
history of pancreatitis there was no indication of an increased risk of pancreatitis when treated with 
liraglutide: in the lira-group 2/147 subjects with a history of pancreatitis experienced a new pancreatitis 
vs 6/120 in the placebo group. 
The first events of acute pancreatitis had onset approximately after 6 months in the liraglutide group and 
after 1 month in the placebo group. In this respect it is of note that drug-induced pancreatitis has been 
observed to present within the first 3 months of treatment. 
Consistent with findings from previous completed clinical trials with liraglutide, the liraglutide group 
experienced a higher increase in lipase and amylase activity levels during the trial compared to the 
placebo group. Among subjects with at least one lipase or amylase value ≥1×ULN, ≥2×ULN or ≥3×ULN 
at any scheduled visit during trial, only a small proportion of subjects had an EAC-confirmed event of 
acute pancreatitis, with no differences noted between treatment groups. Based on this, the predictive 
value of isolated elevations of lipase and/or amylase for future development of pancreatitis is considered 
low. 
Data from trial 3748 does not provide further evidence on a potential causal relationship between 
liraglutide treatment and pancreatitis.

Acute gallstone disease 
Acute gallstone disease is a well-known risk factor for acute pancreatitis and was therefore evaluated in 
trial 3748.

The proportion of subjects with events of acute gall stone disease and the rates of such events were 
higher in the liraglutide group (3.1%; 0.90 events per 100 PYO) than in the placebo group (1.9%, 0.65 
events per 100 PYO) and the mean number of events per subject appeared to increase more over time 
with liraglutide compared to placebo. Among the events reported in both treatment groups, the 
proportions of SAEs (liraglutide: 76% [124/160 events]; placebo: 79% [91/115 events]) and severe 
events (liraglutide: 28% [45/160 events]; placebo: 38% [44/115 events]) of acute gallstone disease 
were not higher in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, the proportions of 
subjects with events leading to hospitalisation at the time of the event (liraglutide: 62.8%; placebo: 
62.2%) and/or resulting in cholecystectomy (acute or elective) (liraglutide: 55.9%; placebo: 57.8%) 
were similar. 
When evaluating events of acute gallstone disease by categorical weight loss at year 3 (weight gain; 0-
5%, 5-10% and >10% weight loss), there was no indication of a relationship between the magnitude of 
the weight changes and the development of acute gallstone disease in subjects in the liraglutide group 
(ratio 0.6 for weight gain and 0.9 for all categories of weight loss). In the placebo group, the proportion 
of subjects with events of acute gallstone disease increased with increasing weight loss (ratio 0.4 for 
weight gain, and 0.5, 1.1, and 1.8 for the respective category of weight loss). 
The higher rate of acute gallstone disease in the liraglutide group was not associated with an increased 
risk of acute pancreatitis. Thus, no difference between treatment groups was seen for EAC-confirmed 
pancreatitis, and the proportion of subjects with pancreatitis and concomitant gallstone disease was not 
higher in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. 
In conclusion, a causal relationship between liraglutide treatment and acute gallstone disease cannot be 
excluded although the mechanism behind this remains unknown.  
Hypoglycaemia 
The overall rates of hypoglycaemic episodes (i.e., confirmed and for overall hypoglycaemia according to 
the ADA classification) were lower in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group. A similar 
pattern was observed for overall nocturnal hypoglycaemia. 
The rates of both severe and confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were lower with liraglutide compared to 
placebo RR: 0.69 [0.51; 0.93]95%CI and RR: 0.81 [0.74; 0.88]95%CI, respectively). A similar pattern in 
favour of liraglutide was also observed for nocturnal severe and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia, RR: 
0.56 [0.29; 1.07]95%CI and RR: 0.62 [0.54; 0.72]95%CI, respectively. 
The vast majority of severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in subjects treated with insulin, SU/glinides 
or a combination of these at baseline in both treatment groups (liraglutide: 167 of 178 severe episodes; 
placebo: 237 of 255 severe episodes). Similarly, the majority of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes 
occurred when subjects were treated with insulin, SU/glinides or a combination of these at baseline in 
both treatment groups (liraglutide: 11128 of 12177 episodes; placebo: 14579 of 15756 episodes). Across 
these categories of baseline medication, lower rates of hypoglycaemia were observed in the liraglutide 
group compared to the placebo group. 
In conclusion, a treatment difference in the rates of severe and confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was 
observed in favour of liraglutide as compared to placebo in combination with standard of care therapy. 
Immunogenicity 
No new safety concerns related to allergic reactions and injection site reactions were identified in trial 
3748. Although based on low numbers, a higher proportion of subjects in the liraglutide group reported 
allergic reactions and injection site reactions compared to the placebo group (allergic reactions: lira 1.3%, 
0.42 events per 100 PY vs placebo 0.9%, 0.27 events per 100 PY; injection site reactions: lira 0.7%, 0.19 
events per 100 PY vs placebo 0.3%, 0.07 events per 100 PY). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 50/73 
 
  
  
The proportion of subject with events of immune complex disease was similar in the liraglutide group and 
in the placebo group (liraglutide: 3 subjects <0.1%; placebo 10 subjects, 0.2%). Thus, the data are not 
suggestive of a causal relationship between liraglutide and immune complex disease. 
Trial 4080 
Overall safety 
A summary of SAEs and AEs of special interest is provided in (Table 16). For each safety parameter the 
proportion of subjects reporting an event, the number of reported events and event rate per 100 PYO 
were similar between the IDeg and IGlar groups. 
Table 16 SAEs and AEs of special interest – FAS 
Serious adverse events 
The majority of SAEs were of severe or moderate severity and were assessed as unlikely related to IMP 
by the investigator. No noteworthy differences between the treatment groups were observed with respect 
to the distribution of SAEs across SOCs and preferred terms. The majority of subjects recovered from the 
events in both treatment groups, and a similar proportion of subjects had SAEs with fatal outcome in both 
treatment groups. 
Similar number of subjects and number of events were reported as severe SAEs in both treatment 
groups. Furthermore, no differences between causality, recovery status and discontinuation of IMP were 
observed in reported severe SAEs between the IDeg and IGlar groups. The distribution of SAEs across 
SOCs was similar between treatment groups. SOCs with the most frequently reported SAEs were “cardiac 
disorders”, “infections and infestations” and “nervous system disorders”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 51/73 
 
  
  
 
Similar number of subjects and number of events were reported as SAEs leading to dose reduction in 
both treatment groups. The two most frequently reported PTs leading to dose reduction were 
hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemic unconsciousness. 
Deaths 
A total of 433 deaths were reported for randomised subjects until the database lock date of 31 October 
2016. Of these, 423 deaths were determined by the EAC to occur during the trial period. These deaths 
occurred in 202 (5.3%) subjects randomised to IDeg and 221 (5.8%) subjects randomised to IGlar. The 
distribution across causes of death was similar between treatment groups. Consistent with the trial 
population being at high risk of cardiovascular events, approximately half of the deaths were attributed to 
cardiovascular causes. The EAC was not able to determine the cause of death in 75 cases. In the primary 
analysis and analysis of cardiovascular death, undetermined cause of death counted as an EAC-confirmed 
cardiovascular death. 
The statistical analysis of time to all-cause death showed no difference between the IDeg and IGlar 
groups (hazard ratio 0.91 [0.75; 1.11]95% CI).  
Severe hypoglycaemia 
A total of 752 events were confirmed by the EAC to be severe hypoglycaemic episodes during the trial 
period, corresponding to a rate of 4.97 events per 100 PYO, with 3.70 episodes per 100 PYO in the IDeg 
group and 6.25 episodes per 100 PYO in the IGlar group. 
Severe hypoglycaemia was confirmed for 187 (4.9%) subjects in the IDeg group and for 252 (6.6%) 
subjects in the IGlar group. 
Of the subjects with EAC-confirmed events of severe hypoglycaemia, the majority experienced a single 
episode as opposed to multiple episodes.  
Nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia 
Of the 752 EAC-confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episodes, 155 episodes were nocturnal, corresponding 
to a rate of 1.02 events per 100 PYO. In the IDeg group, 24 (8.57%) of the EAC-confirmed 
hypoglycaemic episodes did not have a time point reported. In the IGlar group, 33 (6.99%) of the EAC-
confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes did not have a time point reported. Episodes without time point were 
not considered in the statistical analysis. 
The proportion of subjects with nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia was 1.0% in the IDeg group (0.65 
episodes per 100 PYO) and 1.9% in the IGlar group (1.40 episodes per 100 PYO). The rate of nocturnal 
severe hypoglycaemic episodes was significantly lower for IDeg than for IGlar, with an estimated rate 
ratio of 0.47 [0.31; 0.73]95% CI (p<0.001). 
Post hoc on-treatment sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the result. The 
results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results from the main analysis 
Neoplasms 
In total, 255 events were sent for external classification, of which 253 were assigned a definitive 
classification outcome of malignant or benign (only 2 events were unclassifiable). The majority of the 
events were classified as malignant in both treatment groups. The higher proportion of events classified 
as malignant may be a consequence of more malignant than benign neoplasms meeting the criteria for an 
SAE. 
The overall rate of neoplasms was similar in the IDeg and IGlar groups (1.69 vs 1.68 events per 100 
PYO), and the overall rate of malignant neoplasms was 1.32 vs 1.42 events per 100 PYO in the IDeg and 
IGlar groups, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 52/73 
 
  
  
Neoplasms classified as malignant were distributed across several primary organ sites, and there were no 
obvious differences between treatment groups with respect to the distribution of malignant neoplasms 
across specific primary organ sites. 
Laboratory findings 
Trial 3748 
In trial 3748, no new safety findings related to clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, (heart rate, 
SBP, DBP), ECGs and physical examination findings were identified. 
Trial 4080 
In DEVOTE, no new safety findings related to vital signs (pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) 
body weight and body mass index findings were identified. No pregnancies were reported for randomised 
subjects during the trial. 
Safety in special populations 
Trial 3748 
Previously there has been no or limited clinical experience with liraglutide in elderly subjects (≥75 years 
of age), subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects with heart failure (NYHA class I to III). 
Therefore the impact of age, renal function and heart failure on the safety profile of liraglutide was 
evaluated in trial 3748 (NYHA class IV and end-stage renal disease [i.e. current continuous renal 
replacement therapy] were exclusion criteria in trial 3748). A total of 836 subjects were aged ≥75 years 
(3074 PYO), a total of 224 subjects had severe renal impairment at baseline (771 PYO) and a total of 
1653 subjects had heart failure (NYHA class I to III) (6044 PYO). For all subgroups by age, renal function 
and heart failure status the following event types were evaluated: EAC-confirmed expanded MACE, 
deaths, AEs (SAEs and non-serious MESIs) and hypoglycaemic episodes. Furthermore, for subgroups by 
renal function, EAC-confirmed nephropathy, renal laboratory parameters and the SMQ ‘acute renal failure’ 
was evaluated. 
Age 
The proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed expanded MACE (including the individual components of 
expanded MACE) and the rate of such events increased with increasing age in both treatment groups but 
were similar or lower with liraglutide compared to placebo across all age groups. 
As expected the proportion of subjects who died (both EAC-confirmed cardiovascular and non-
cardiovascular deaths) tended to increase with higher age in both treatment groups. The proportion of 
subjects who died tended to be lower in the liraglutide group when compared to the placebo group across 
age groups.  
The proportion of subjects experiencing AEs (SAEs and non-serious MESIs), SAEs and severe events and 
the rate of such events increased with increasing age in both treatment groups, with no marked 
differences between treatment groups. The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of trial product and the rate of such events increased with increasing age and tended to 
be higher in the liraglutide group across all age groups, in line with the pattern observed for the overall 
population. 
Across age groups, there were no unexpected patterns in the distribution of AEs compared to that 
observed for the overall trial population. The treatment differences in favour of liraglutide observed in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 53/73 
 
  
  
‘cardiovascular events’ SOC appeared to be present across the different age groups and were in line with 
the results seen for EAC-confirmed expanded MACE. 
A low number of subjects aged >85 years (liraglutide: 12; placebo: 10) experienced confirmed and/or 
severe hypoglycaemic episodes, thus further evaluation of these data was not considered appropriate for 
this subgroup. The rates of both confirmed and severe hypoglycaemia were similar or lower in the 
liraglutide group compared to the placebo group across age groups, except in the age group of subjects 
aged 75-84 years in which there was a slightly higher rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes in the 
liraglutide group compared to the placebo group. However, in that age group the rate of severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes was similar between the two treatment groups.  
Renal function 
In trial 3748, a total of 224 subjects with severe renal impairment at baseline were enrolled, with a 
substantial observation time accumulated in both treatment groups (liraglutide: 117 subjects/ 405 PYO; 
placebo: 107 subjects/ 366 PYO). There were no notable differences between treatment groups with 
respect to the distribution of EAC-confirmed expanded MACE, deaths, AEs (SAEs and non-serious MESIs), 
hypoglycaemic episodes, EAC-confirmed nephropathy events, renal laboratory parameters or acute renal 
failure across renal subgroups. Specifically, no new safety findings were identified in subjects with severe 
renal impairment, suggesting that liraglutide was safe to use in this subgroup of subjects. 
Heart failure status 
In trial 3748, a total of 1439 subjects with NYHA class I-II were enrolled with a substantial observation 
time accumulated in both treatment groups (liraglutide: 724 subjects/ 2654 PYO; placebo: 715 subjects/ 
2610 PYO) and a total of 214 subjects with NYHA class III were enrolled (liraglutide: 108 subjects/393 
PYO; placebo: 106 subjects/387 PYO). There were no notable differences between treatment groups with 
respect to the distribution of EAC-confirmed expanded MACE, deaths, AEs (SAEs and non-serious MESIs) 
or hypoglycaemic episodes across the subgroups for heart failure status. No new safety findings were 
identified in subjects with NYHA class I, II or III, suggesting that liraglutide was safe to use in this 
subgroup of subjects. 
Trial 4080 
Previously there has been limited clinical experience with insulin degludec in subjects with hepatic 
impairment and in subjects with severe renal impairment. 
Age 
At baseline, a total of 3955 trial subjects were aged ≥65 years, which amounted to 51.8% of the total 
trial population, and 819 (10.7%) subjects were aged ≥75 years, thus ensuring significant exposure in 
geriatric subjects. In the reported safety areas results were similar across age groups between IDeg and 
IGlar. 
Renal function 
In DEVOTE subjects had varying degrees of renal impairment, with more than a third of the trial 
population having moderate (35.8%) or severe renal impairment (2.8%). In the reported safety areas 
results were similar across renal function subgroups between IDeg and IGlar. 
Sex 
Of the total trial population 37.4% were female and 62.6% were male. The general SAE data were similar 
across female and male subgroups between IDeg and IGlar.

Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment, except for end stage liver disease, could be included in the trial. A total 
of 196 patients (2.6%) with hepatic impairment (defined as having a score of > 2 on a modified Child-
Pugh criteria scale using only bilirubin and albumin values) were included (102 patients in the IDeg group 
and 94 patients in the IGlar group). The general SAE data were similar across subjects with hepatic 
impairment and subjects with no hepatic impairment between IDeg and IGlar. 
Post marketing experience 
Trial 3748 
From the post-marketing experience with liraglutide, two pharmacoepidemiology studies are especially 
relevant for this application. One study utilised the Optum Research Database (an insurance claims 
database in the US) and the other study utilised the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the UK (a 
medical records based set of data; the CPRD study). The objective of the two database studies was to 
evaluate the safety of liraglutide when used in clinical practice post-marketing. This included an 
evaluation of a potential relationship between Victoza and MTC, in addition to other predefined outcomes 
of special interest such as thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, acute pancreatitis and neoplasms. 
The Optum Research Database study was a post-marketing requirement from the FDA (PMR 1583-6) 
and was included in the liraglutide RMP as a required pharmacovigilance activity (category 3). The study 
was a 5-year prospective observational cohort safety surveillance study evaluating the safety of 
liraglutide in routine use and with thyroid cancer and, specifically MTC, as primary outcome. Secondary 
outcomes included acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (evaluated according to a pre-specified 
algorithm). Participants were adult (≥18 years) initiators of liraglutide or a comparator between 
01 February 2010 and 30 November 2014. A total of 5 comparison cohorts were defined by different 
antidiabetic therapies (exenatide, metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylureas and DPP-4 inhibitors) and 
3 overall comparison cohorts defined by 1) all comparison treatments, 2) all comparison treatments 
excluding exenatide, and 3) all comparison treatments excluding other incretin-based treatments. Across 
the study period there were 35,898 episodes of initiation of liraglutide (initial and subsequent) and nearly 
all liraglutide initiators (initial and subsequent) (35,197; 98%) were propensity score-matched to a 
member of the all comparators cohort (493,978 episodes of initiation).  
No new safety concerns were identified based on the results from the 5-year safety surveillance study. 
Furthermore, the results did not indicate any increased risk with respect to pre-specified outcomes 
(thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, acute pancreatitis and a number of other safety outcomes) when 
comparing liraglutide with other antidiabetic medications in common use. 
The Optum Research Database study report was submitted to EMA June 2016 (EMEA/H/C/WS/0943) and 
to the FDA 15 July 2016. 
The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) study was a post-authorisation measure requested 
by the CHMP. It was set up as a cohort study of adult subjects in a large primary healthcare database 
from the UK population (CPRD), using their primary care database (GOLD), the Hospital Episode Statistics 
(HES) and the National Cancer Data Repository (NCDR). The study evaluated the safety of liraglutide in 
routine use, was based on an inception cohort design, and compared new users of liraglutide with new 
users of seven other non-insulin antidiabetic treatments (sulphonylureas, biguanides, acarbose, 
exenatide, glinides, glitazones, and DPP-4 inhibitors) for several outcomes (neoplasms, thyroid cancer 
(including medullary [C-cell origin]), pancreatic cancer, acute pancreatitis and macrovascular conditions).  
The GOLD database identified about 250,000 patients that fulfilled all of the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Of the patients identified as initiating liraglutide treatment in GOLD, 3432 were eligible for HES 
Assessment report

Page 55/73 
 
  
  
linkage and 894 were eligible for both HES and NCDR linkage. Patients were followed for 3.5 years on 
average.  
The final results did not indicate any increased risk with respect to the specified outcomes of interest for 
patients treated with Victoza compared to patients treated with comparator products 
(EMEA/H/C/001026/II/WS784). 
Trial 4080 
Based on global data (until 31 Dec 2016) for insulin degludec (Tresiba) with an estimated cumulative 
exposure of 930000 PYE no new safety concerns were raised.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trial 3748 
In trial 3748, only SAEs (serious adverse events) and MESIs (medical event of special interest) were 
systematically collected and the present evaluation is based on these events only. MESIs discussed in this 
section are: neoplasms and calcitonin, thyroid disease, pancreatitis, acute gallstone disease, 
hypoglycaemia and immunogenicity. 
Overall, the differences in proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed neoplasms between treatment 
groups were 10.1% versus 9.0% for overall neoplasms, 3.6% versus 3.1% for benign neoplasms and 
6.3% versus 6.0% for malignant neoplasms for liraglutide versus placebo.  
For some individual neoplasms, the HR was > 1. This was especially true for pancreatic carcinoma and 
melanoma of the skin; the 95% CI was 0.92-7.27 for both neoplasms. EAC-confirmed pancreatic 
cancer was seen in 13 subjects (14 events, 0.3%, rate 0.08 events/100PY) in the liraglutide group vs 5 
subjects (5 events, 0.1%, rate 0.03 events/100PY) in the placebo group. The MAH reasons that the 
relatively early presentation of the (advanced) cases suggest that these were pre-existing malignancies 
and that the incidence falls within the predicted range for T2DM patients (0.06-14.3 events/100PY). In 
addition two post-marketing epidemiological studies did not indicate an increased risk for pancreatic 
cancer. In a recent study of human pancreatic tissue, normal ductal epithelial cells, ductal pancreatic 
carcinomas, or pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 3 did not express GLP-1 R indicating that GLP-1 Rs are 
unlikely to be related to neoplastic transformation in the pancreas. However, there were already 
uncertainties whether incretin-based treatments are related to pancreatic neoplasms. These uncertainties 
have not been removed by the present data. Therefore it was decided that pancreatic cancer will remain 
as an Important potential risk in the RMP for liraglutide. As there is no change in the situation, a change 
in the SmPC with regard to mentioning pancreatic carcinoma was not considered necessary.  
Malignant melanoma was another neoplasm seen more frequently with liraglutide compared to placebo 
(20 events in 19 subjects in the liraglutide group vs 9 events in 9 placebo-treated patients). The events 
occurred at similar rates until month 18, after which events continued to accrue in the liraglutide group, 
while in the placebo group only 2 additional events occurred. Melanoma was not identified as a risk in 
earlier trials or in the two epidemiological trials performed post-marketing. However, most trials were of 
shorter duration than 18 months, and thus a difference could not be detected if it occurs after 18 months. 
The MAH states that LEADER was not designed nor powered to demonstrate a treatment effect in relation 
to neoplasm subtypes. For malignant melanoma specifically, risk factors were not systematically collected 
at baseline, and the skin was not subject to systematic evaluation during the trial. It is agreed with the 
MAH that there is no acceleration in rate of events, which might have been expected when a tumour 
promoting effect is present; there was a flattening in the placebo curve. From the data a causal relation 
can not be confirmed or excluded. However, seen the importance of the disorder monitoring malignant 
melanoma through routine pharmacovigilance activities, as proposed by the MAH, was considered not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 56/73 
 
  
  
sufficient. Therefore, it was decided that 'neoplasm (including melanoma)' should be included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP for liraglutide.  
Trial data do not support a causal relationship between treatment with liraglutide and the risk of breast 
cancer, colorectal neoplasms, or thyroid neoplasms (all data not shown). Also, combination with 
insulin did not show an increased risk for the occurrence of neoplasms (data not shown).  
Thyroid disease occurred in similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups (lira 4.2%, placebo 
4.1%). However, in subjects with a medical history of thyroid disease, the proportion with events of 
thyroid disease was higher in the liraglutide group (7.5%) than in the placebo group (5.8%). This has 
also been observed in the liraglutide T2DM clinical development programme. The imbalance was driven 
by events of goitre (liraglutide 16 events, placebo 6 events). 
In 2014, FDA and EMA made an independent review and evaluation of all available data regarding the risk 
of pancreatitis with incretin-based drugs. At that time, the agencies concluded that there was no strong 
evidence to support a causal relationship, but that pancreatitis should be regarded as a potential risk with 
these therapies until further data became available. A class labelling was therefore issued for all incretin-
based therapies concerning the risk of pancreatitis. Data from trial 3748 did not show a difference in the 
incidence of pancreatitis between treatment groups. The proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed acute 
pancreatitis and the rates of events were comparable between the liraglutide group (0.4%; 0.11 events 
per 100 PYO) and the placebo group (0.5%; 0.19 events per 100 PYO). The SmPC for liraglutide was 
amended to include these data from the LEADER trial. Further to this, pancreatitis was removed as an 
important identified risk from the RMP for liraglutide.  
In contrast, acute gallstone disease seen as a well-known risk factor for pancreatitis, was observed 
more frequently in the liraglutide group (3.1%; 0.90 events per 100 PYO) than in the placebo group 
(1.9%, 0.65 events per 100 PYO). Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis are already included in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC for IDegLira. Somewhat surprisingly, these events were not clearly related to cases of 
pancreatitis in this trial. Acute gallstone disease was included as an important identified risk in the RMP 
for liraglutide. 
Data for hypoglycaemia were in favour of liraglutide compared to placebo, when added to standard of 
care. As can be expected, the vast majority of severe or confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 
subjects treated with insulin and/or SU/glinides. Though based on few patients (401 liraglutide-treated 
patients aged age 75-84 years, 17 liraglutide-treated patients aged age ≥85 years and 25 placebo-
treated patients aged age ≥85 years), severe hypoglycaemia was observed with a noticeable higher 
frequency among liraglutide-treated patients aged age ≥85 years (11.76%) both when compared to 
liraglutide-treated patients aged 75-84 years (3.99%) and placebo-treated patients aged age ≥85 years 
(4.00%). However, it concerned only 2 patients, who were also treated with insulin as a confounding 
factor. No amendments were made to the SmPC for liraglutide.   
No new safety concerns related to allergic reactions and injection site reactions were identified in 
trial 3748.  
The LEADER trial included a total of 836 subjects were aged ≥75 years (3074 PYO), a total of 224 
subjects had severe renal impairment at baseline (771 PYO) and a total of 1653 subjects had heart failure 
(NYHA class I to III) (6044 PYO), subgroups for which limited experience exists from previous trials. 
There were more deaths with increasing age, as can be expected. CV-death and all-cause death tended 
to be lower with liraglutide compared to placebo. There was no difference between treatment groups in 
the incidence of SAEs and MESIs in the different age classes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 57/73 
 
  
  
For renally impaired patients too, CV-death and all-cause death increased with increasing impairment, 
but the incidence tended to be lower in the liraglutide group. No difference between treatment groups 
was seen for SAEs and MESIs. 
The same pattern was seen for patients in the different classes of heart failure. Although the differences 
between liraglutide and placebo were small, they were in favour of liraglutide. 
Results indicate that liraglutide might be used safely in these patients. The SmPC for liraglutide was 
updated with regards to the elderly and patients with renal impairment, and similar amendments are 
proposed for the IDegLira SmPC. This is acceptable, considering that the current recommendations relate 
to liraglutide and not to IDeg. Based on these data, mild/moderate hepatic impairment, severe renal 
impairment and congestive heart failure NYHA III was removed as missing information in the liraglutide 
RMP. 
Trial 4080 
As the safety profile of both IDeg and IGlar are well characterised, the focus of the safety evaluation in 
the DEVOTE trial was on CV safety and hypoglycaemias. In addition, events of neoplasms were evaluated.  
The trial contributes with a total of 15,125 PYE, which was evenly distributed between the two treatment 
groups.  
The overall reporting pattern of SAEs and AEs of special interest did not differ between treatments and 
when SAEs were presented by SOC, no differences were observed. The rate of AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment did not differ between groups. Few events were considered probably or 
possibly related to study medication (0.6% of events for IDeg and 0.8% of events for IGlar). Eight events 
of medication errors leading to SAEs were reported (four in each group) and three of these events were 
assessed as related to study medication. The events were due to unintentional overdose or double dosing 
due to missed dose, resulting in hypoglycaemias. There was no difference observed between treatments 
neither in the number of deaths (202 for IDeg and 221 for IGlar), nor in the causes of death. The rate of 
neoplasms did not differ between treatments. 
The rate of severe hypoglycaemic events was lower with IDeg than with IGlar, see also efficacy section of 
the AR. The characteristics of the severe hypoglycaemia events were comparable for IDeg and IGlar, 
although common symptoms were less frequently reported with IDeg. Notably, unconsciousness and 
coma was reported at a comparable rate (1.4% and 1.6% for IDeg and IGlar, respectively). Fewer 
subjects experienced severe hypoglycaemia with IDeg than with IGlar (4.9% and 6.6%, respectively). 
The majority of patients only experienced a single event. The analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed 
severe hypoglycaemic episode confirms that hypoglycaemic episodes were less frequent with IDeg 
throughout the study duration. Nocturnal hypoglycaemias were also analysed and the rate was 
significantly lower with IDeg than with IGlar (rate ratio 0.47 [0.31; 0.73]95% CI (p<0.001)). 
There were no apparent differences in the use of other antidiabetic medications that could explain the 
differences observed in the occurrence of hypoglycaemias. Based on these data, and in accordance with 
the GVP Module V, hypoglycaemia was removed as an important identified risk from the RMP for IDeg. 
There were no differences in changes in clinical laboratory parameters or vital signs between groups. 
Generally, changes over time were only minor. 
The trial included 214 patients with severe renal impairment and 196 patients with hepatic impairment. 
When the safety data for these patients were compared between the two treatment groups, no 
differences in the safety profile were observed. Although the number of patients within these groups and 
exposed to IDeg are limited (108 patients with severe renal impairment and 102 patients with hepatic 
impairment), the trial provided long-term data of about 2 years without any emergent safety issues. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 58/73 
 
  
  
Therefore “severe renal impairment” and “hepatic impairment” were removed as missing information 
from the RMP for IDeg. 
2.5.1.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In both trials, only SAEs (serious adverse events) and MESIs (medical event of special interest) were 
systematically collected. Both trials also provided data on safety in special subgroups, for which the 
experience previously has been limited. 
With the LEADER trial, safety data was provided regarding a number of known safety concerns with the 
use of liraglutide. Neoplasms were considered as MESI. Overall, there were no significant differences in 
proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed neoplasms between treatment groups. Especially data for 
breast cancer, colorectal neoplasms and thyroid neoplasms did not show an increased risk with 
liraglutide. However, for pancreatic carcinoma and malignant melanoma, a numerical increase was 
observed in patients treated with liraglutide. However, no updates were made in the SmPC due to these 
findings. 
No difference between treatment groups was seen in the incidence of pancreatitis; and based on these 
data and data from observational studies, amendments were made to the SmPC. Cholelithiasis was 
observed more frequently with liraglutide and was added to section 4.8 of the SmPC for liraglutide.  
Results in subgroups of elderly patients, patients with severe renal insufficiency and subjects with heart 
failure did not reveal significant differences between liraglutide and placebo in safety profile. 
No new safety concerns arise from the analysis of the data from the DEVOTE trial. The safety profile of 
IDeg is comparable to that observed with the comparator IGlar, for which there is long clinical 
experience. The lower rate of hypoglycaemias observed with IDeg compared to IGlar, confirms previous 
observations in clinical trials. No safety concerns arise with regards to the use of IDeg in patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment. 
The safety data provided by trials 3478 and 4080 are partly of relevance to IDegLira. The warnings 
regarding pancreatitis and thyroid disease are both based on safety data for liraglutide and the proposed 
updates to align the SmPC for IDegLira with that of liraglutide is acceptable. Cholelithiasis and 
cholecystitis is however already included in section 4.8 for IDegLira, thus no updates are needed. The 
data on hypoglycaemias with IDeg is not relevant to IDegLira, and no updates are proposed. 
The restrictions with regards to the use of IDegLira in elderly patients, patients with severe renal 
insufficiency and subjects with heart failure are also based on safety data for liraglutide, thus the 
proposed updates to align the SmPC for IDegLira with that of liraglutide are acceptable. 
2.5.2.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
• 
• 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.0 is acceptable.  
In addition, it was recommended that with the next RMP update, the MAH should implement the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 59/73 
 
  
  
Guidance on the format of the risk management plan (RMP) in the EU – in integrated format 
(Rev. 2) with the definition of important risks, as per GVP module V revision 2, on which the list 
of safety concerns could be shortened. 
• 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated 
version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion 
should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 7.0 with the following content: 
Safety concerns 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
There are no planned or ongoing additional pharmacovigilance activities.  
Routine Pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient to further characterise all safety concerns included in 
the safety specification of the RMP.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated in order to 
include the safety information based on cardiovascular outcomes studies conducted a for each of the 
monocomponents of Xultophy: LEADER (Liraglutide Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) and DEVOTE (Insulin 
Degludec Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial). Moreover, information regarding certain safety issues related 
to liraglutide, including information on special populations, have been included. There were no 
consequential changes to the PIL. 
SmPC section 4.1 has been revised as follows (new text in bold, removed text as strikethrough): 
"Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in combination with oral glucose-
lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or basal insulin 
do not provide adequate glycaemic control in addition to other oral medicinal products for the 
treatment of diabetes. (For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic 
control, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on the different 
combinations).". 
For the other changes of the SmPC see Attachement. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH, however, the proposed changes to the package leaflet were 
minimal. No changes of the package leaflet were agreed following the assessment of the variation 
application. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Xultophy remains on the list of medicines under additional monitoring; the fixed ratio combination of 
liraglutide and insulin degludec has an EURD date of 18/09/2014.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The previously approved indication for Xultophy was: 
“Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic 
control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products when these alone or combined with 
a GLP-1 receptor agonist or basal insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1 for available data on the different combinations).” 
With this application the MAH had proposed to include reference to the effect of Xultophy on 
cardiovascular events in section 4.1. The indication was also simplified: 
“Xultophy is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in 
combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. For study results with respect to 
combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see 
sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
Further to this, some other changes to section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were proposed. 
The therapeutic objectives of treatment for diabetes include both glycaemic glucose control and the 
prevention of cardiovascular events and microvascular complications. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
T2DM is a progressive metabolic disorder characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia associated with 
increased risk of long-term micro-and macrovascular complications. Diabetes has been identified as an 
independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which represents the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in subjects with diabetes. Thus, the risk of cardiovascular disease is 2−4 times greater for 
patients with T2DM compared to the general population, and death from cardiovascular causes is the 
most common cause of death in patients with T2DM. 
Even with use of standard of care therapies to control cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of 
cardiovascular disease in subjects with diabetes remains to be more than double that in subjects without 
diabetes. Hence, the cardiovascular safety of antidiabetic drugs is of paramount importance. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
With this application, the results of two cardiovascular outcome trials are presented. Both studies have 
been previously assessed by the CHMP, therefore only an abbreviated description of the studies is 
provided in this assessment report. 
• 
• 
Trial 3748 – LEADER - inclusion of data in the SmPC for Victoza (liraglutide) was approved in July 
2017 through procedure EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0042. 
Trial 4080 – DEVOTE - inclusion of data in the SmPC for Tresiba (IDegLira) was approved in Sept 
2017 through procedure EMEA/H/C/002498/II/0028. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 63/73 
 
  
  
Both studies were designed to investigate the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide and IDeg, respectively. 
However, as the data on cardiovascular outcome is relevant for the assessment of the proposed change 
to the indication, the cardiovascular outcome is presented in the efficacy part of this report. 
Trial 3748 was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial performed to determine the effect and safety of liraglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular 
outcomes. The trial included 9340 subjects with a very high risk for CV events (> 80% were > 50 years 
with established CV disease and 18% were >60 years with risk factors for CV disease). Both liraglutide 
and placebo were used in addition to standard of care therapy to ensure scientific rigour of the 
comparison. Primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of 3-point MACE. The median time of 
observation in the trial was 3.84 years (including follow-up period) and the total median exposure time to 
the trial product was 3.52 years. 
Trial 4080 was a randomised, double-blind and event-driven clinical trial with a median duration of 2 
years comparing the cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec (IDeg) versus insulin glargine (IGlar, 100 
units/mL) in 7,637 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk of cardiovascular events.  The 
majority of patients included were patients aged ≥ 50 years with established cardiovascular disease or 
chronic kidney disease. The primary analysis was time from randomisation to first occurrence of a 3-point 
MACE. The median time of observation was 1.99 years and the total median exposure time to the trial 
product was 1.83 years. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Trial 3748 
A total of 1302 first EAC-confirmed MACEs were reported in trial 3748 (608/4668 [13.0%] in the 
liraglutide group and 694/4672 [14.9%] in the placebo group). In the primary Cox analysis of time to 
first EAC-confirmed MACE, the estimated hazard ratio (liraglutide vs placebo) of 0.87 [0.78; 0.97]95% CI 
was statistically significant and in favour of liraglutide. All three components of MACE-3 contributed to the 
reduction; most notably CV-death (HR 0.79). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the primary 
analysis. 
Expanded MACE was a secondary endpoint. It consisted of the components of MACE-3 plus hospitalisation 
for unstable angina pectoris, coronary revascularisation and hospitalisation for heart failure. Estimated 
hazard ratio (liraglutide vs placebo) for time to expanded MACE was 0.88 (0.81; 0.96). 
The risk of all-cause death was reduced (HR 0.85 [0.74; 0.97]); supported by a beneficial trend in non-
CV death HR (0.95 [0.77; 1.18]). 
The reduction in MACE was substantiated by a series of pre-specified sensitivity analyses. These included 
several ‘on-treatment’ analyses, which resulted in lower point estimates consistent with a liraglutide 
mediated effect. 
For microvascular events an exploratory composite endpoint was formulated consisting of nephropathy 
(4 components) and retinopathy (3 components). Treatment with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of the 
time to first occurrence of the composite microvascular endpoint (HR 0.84 [0.73; 0.970]. Also, a 
reduction in nephropathy was observed in favour of liraglutide (HR 0.78 [0.67; 0.92). This was primarily 
driven by “new onset of macroalbuminuria” (HR 0.74 [0.60; 0.91]). 
A total of 836 subjects were aged ≥75 years, and exploratory analyses were performed according to 4 
subgroups of age (<65 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and ≥85 years). The proportion of subjects with 
EAC-confirmed expanded MACE (including the individual components of expanded MACE) and the rate of

such events increased with increasing age in both treatment groups but were similar or lower with 
liraglutide compared to placebo across all age groups. 
In trial 3748, a total of 224 subjects with severe renal impairment at baseline were enrolled. For 
MACE-3 a treatment interaction was observed for subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment vs 
subjects with mild or no renal impairment (eGFR < 60 vs eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2)(p=0.03). The HR of 
the effect of liraglutide in subjects with eGFR < 60 was 0.71 (0.58; 0.87) vs 0.93 (0.82; 1.06) in subjects 
with eGFR ≥ 60. 
Exploratory analyses were performed according to 4 subgroups of renal function (normal, renal function, 
or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment) for expanded MACE. There were no notable differences 
between treatment groups with respect to the distribution of EAC-confirmed expanded MACE and deaths. 
A total of 1439 subjects with NYHA class I-II were enrolled (liraglutide: 724 subjects/ 2654 PYO; placebo: 
715 subjects/ 2610 PYO) and a total of 214 subjects with NYHA class III were enrolled (liraglutide: 108 
subjects/393 PYO; placebo: 106 subjects/387 PYO). There were no notable differences between 
treatment groups with respect to the distribution of EAC-confirmed expanded MACE, deaths, AEs (SAEs 
and non-serious MESIs) or hypoglycaemic episodes across the subgroups for HF status; however, there 
was a numerical increase in non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and HF hospitalisations in patients with NYHA 
III at baseline. 
For glycaemic control, the reduction in HbA1c was significantly greater with liraglutide than with placebo 
after 3 years of treatment (-1.16% versus -0.77%; estimated treatment difference of -0.4% [-0.45; 
-0.34]95% CI); and the difference was maintained at end of treatment (-0.3% [-0.35; -0.23] 95% CI). The 
effect of liraglutide on glycaemic control, as measured by HbA1c, was consistent across age groups (<65, 
65-74, 75-84, > 85), baseline renal function (normal, mild, moderate, severe renal impairment), and 
heart failure status (NYHA class I-III). The improvement in glycaemic control was achieved with lower 
rates of both severe and confirmed hypoglycaemia as compared to placebo. The effect of liraglutide on 
HbA1c was accompanied by a reduced likelihood of initiation of other glucose-lowering treatment during 
the trial, including insulin or any new oral antidiabetics. Liraglutide was associated with a greater 
reduction in body weight compared to placebo of around 2.3 kg, which was sustained throughout the 
trial, as well as small but statistically significant reductions in SBP.  
Trial 4080 
A total of 681 first EAC-confirmed MACEs were reported in trial 4080, of which 325 occurred with IDeg 
and 356 with IGlar. The primary analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE resulted in an estimated HR 
of 0.91 [0.78; 1.06]95% CI for IDeg relative to IGlar. The upper bound of the 95% CI was below 1.3, thus 
confirming non-inferiority of IDeg relative to IGlar with respect to cardiovascular safety. The outcome was 
supported by the sensitivity analyses, including the analysis in the PP set. Events occurred evenly 
distributed overtime for both treatments and the three component of MACE (non-fatal MI, non-fatal 
stroke and CV-death) were equally distributed for both treatments. 
The first confirmatory secondary endpoint (number of EAC-confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes) showed 
that IDeg was superior to IGlar (RR 0.60 [0.48; 0.76]95% CI (p<0.001)). The result was supported by the 
sensitivity analyses performed. 
The second confirmatory secondary endpoint (occurrence of at least one EAC-confirmed severe 
hypoglycaemic episode within a subject) also showed that IDeg was superior to IGlar with a reduced risk 
of experiencing hypoglycaemia (OR 0.73 [0.60; 0.89]95% CI (p=0.001)). Again, the result was supported 
by the sensitivity analyses performed. 
There was no difference in the change in HbA1c from baseline between treatments, confirming that 
patients were titrated to target in both treatment groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 65/73 
 
  
  
At 24 months, slightly higher doses of IDeg were observed compared to IGlar, however at the last visit 
before end-of-trial, no difference was observed. There were no major differences in bolus doses or total 
insulin dose between groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Trial 3478 
Exploratory analyses were performed to evaluate the consistency of the treatment effect between 
liraglutide and placebo in time to first MACE across multiple subgroups. The benefit observed with 
liraglutide versus placebo was generally consistent across the majority of the pre-defined subgroups. 
However, for Region North America (HR 1.01 [0.84; 1.22]) and in subjects’ ≥60 years of age with 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease (HR 1.20 [0.86; 1.67]) HR was above 1. There were baseline 
differences between US and European participants. In addition, the mean proportion of time on trial 
drug was lower in the US (0.73%) than in the non-US population. The lower exposure to trial drug in the 
US population may explain the observed difference. A number of post-hoc analyses were performed for 
the cardiovascular risk groups. These did not reveal an explanation for the observed difference. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Trial 3478 
In trial 3748, only SAEs (serious adverse events) and MESIs (medical event of special interest) were 
systematically collected and the present evaluation is based on these events only. MESIs discussed are: 
neoplasms, thyroid disease, pancreatitis, acute gallstone disease, and immunogenicity. 
Overall, the proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed neoplasms was low in both treatment groups 
(10.1% versus 9.0% for overall neoplasms, 3.6% versus 3.1% for benign neoplasms and 6.3% versus 
6.0% for malignant neoplasms for liraglutide versus placebo). Notably, for some individual neoplasms 
(pancreatic carcinoma and malignant melanoma) the HR was > 1 (see below). 
No clear differences between treatment groups were observed for breast cancer (HR 1.06 [0.57; 1.96]), 
colorectal neoplasms (HR 0.99 [0.59; 1.68]), or thyroid neoplasms (HR 1.66 [0.40; 6.95]). 
Thyroid disease occurred in similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups (liraglutide 4.2%, 
placebo 4.1%). However, in subjects with a medical history of thyroid disease, the proportion with events 
of thyroid disease was higher in the liraglutide group (7.5%) than in the placebo group (5.8%). This has 
also been observed in the liraglutide T2DM clinical development programme. The imbalance was driven 
by events of goitre (liraglutide 16 events, placebo 6 events). 
The proportion of subjects with EAC-confirmed acute pancreatitis and the rates of events were 
comparable between the liraglutide group (0.4%; 0.11 events per 100 PYO) and the placebo group 
(0.5%; 0.19 events per 100 PYO). 
In contrast, acute gallstone disease, seen as a well-known risk factor for pancreatitis was observed 
more frequently in the liraglutide group (3.1%; 0.90 events per 100 PYO) than in the placebo group 
(1.9%, 0.65 events per 100 PYO). However, no association with pancreatitis events was observed. 
The overall rates of hypoglycaemic episodes (i.e., confirmed and for overall hypoglycaemia according 
to the ADA classification) were lower in the liraglutide group compared to the placebo group (confirmed: 
liraglutide 70.2 episodes/100PY, placebo 91.2 episodes/100PY; ADA overall liraglutide 308.2 
episodes/100PY, placebo 358.4 episodes/100PY). A similar pattern was observed for confirmed and 
overall nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The rates of both severe and confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 66/73 
 
  
  
lower with liraglutide compared to placebo RR: 0.69 [0.51; 0.93]95%CI and RR: 0.81 [0.74; 0.88]95%CI, 
respectively. A similar pattern in favour of liraglutide was also observed for nocturnal severe and 
nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia. 
Although based on few patients (401 liraglutide-treated patients aged age 75-84 years, 17 liraglutide-
treated patients aged age ≥85 years and 25 placebo-treated patients aged age ≥85 years), severe 
hypoglycaemia was observed with a noticeable higher frequency among liraglutide-treated patients aged 
age ≥85 years (11.76%) both when compared to liraglutide-treated patients aged 75-84 years (3.99%) 
and placebo-treated patients aged age ≥85 years (4.00%). However, it concerned only 2 patients, who 
were also treated with insulin as a confounding factor. For subgroups by age, renal impairment category, 
and heart failure class, no differences between treatment groups were seen in the incidence of SAEs and 
MESIs. 
Trial 4080 
The focus of the safety evaluation in the DEVOTE trial was on CV safety and hypoglycaemias. Only the 
following types of events were systematically collected: all SAEs, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of investigational product, medication errors leading to an SAE and 
adverse events related to technical complaints. Data on neoplasms was also collected and was subject to 
external classification. 
The trial contributes with a total of 15,125 PYO, which were evenly distributed between the two treatment 
groups.  
The observed MACE rate was 5.28 events per 100 PYO, similar in both groups. In the safety evaluation a 
4-point MACE, which also included “unstable angina requiring hospitalisation”, was evaluated. The 
outcome of this evaluation was in line with the primary analysis, thus no difference was observed 
between treatments. No difference between treatments was observed in events of heart failure requiring 
hospitalisation. The analysis of MACE in different subgroups was consistent with the primary analysis. 
There was no difference observed between treatments neither in the number of deaths (202 for IDeg and 
221 for IGlar), nor in the causes of death. 
The overall reporting pattern of SAEs and AEs of special interest did not differ between treatments and 
when SAEs were presented by SOC, no differences were observed. 
Fewer subjects experienced severe hypoglycaemia with IDeg than with IGlar (4.9% and 6.6%, 
respectively). The majority of patients only experienced a single event. The analysis of time to first EAC-
confirmed severe hypoglycaemic episode confirms that hypoglycaemic episodes were less frequent with 
IDeg throughout the study duration. Nocturnal hypoglycaemias were also analysed and the rate was 
significantly lower with IDeg than with IGlar (rate ratio 0.47 [0.31; 0.73]95% CI (p<0.001)). There were 
no apparent differences in the use of other antidiabetic medications that could explain the differences 
observed in the occurrence of hypoglycaemias. 
The trial included 214 patients (2.8%) with severe renal impairment and 196 patients (2.6%) with 
hepatic impairment. When the safety data for these patients were compared between the two treatment 
groups, no differences in the safety profile were observed. Although the number of patients within these 
groups and exposed to IDeg are limited (108 patients with severe renal impairment and 102 patients with 
hepatic impairment), the trial provides long-term data of about 2 years without any emergent safety 
issues. “Severe renal impairment” and “hepatic impairment” were deleted as missing information from 
the RMP for IDeg based on the data provided.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Trial 3478 
Pancreatic neoplasms were analysed as a MESI. The HR was 2.59 (0.92; 7.27), in favour of placebo. 
EAC-confirmed pancreatic cancer was seen in 13 subjects (14 events, 0.3%, rate 0.08 events/100PY) in 
the liraglutide group vs 5 subjects (5 events, 0.1%, rate 0.03 events/100PY) in the placebo group. The 
majority of the events were ductal adenocarcinomas and advanced at time of diagnosis (i.e., of stage IIA 
or above; according to the AJCC staging system). 
Malignant melanoma occurred in 20 events (19 subjects) in the liraglutide group vs 9 events (9 
patients) in the placebo group. The events occurred at similar rates until month 18, after which events 
continued to accrue in the liraglutide group, while in the placebo group only 2 additional events occurred. 
Melanoma has not been identified as a risk in earlier trials or in the two epidemiological trials performed 
post-marketing. 
The HR for retinopathy was above 1 (HR 1.15[0.87; 1.52]), and this was primarily due to “vitreous 
haemorrhage”. The incidence of vitreous haemorrhage tended to be higher in the liraglutide group, as 
compared to the placebo group (HR 1.45 [0.84; 2.50]).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
T2DM is characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia associated with increased risk of long-term micro-and 
macrovascular complications. Diabetes has been identified as an independent risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease and until recently, metformin was the only antidiabetic drug considered to have 
demonstrated a positive effect on macrovascular outcomes. Even with use of standard of care therapies 
to control cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of cardiovascular disease in subjects with diabetes remains 
to be more than double that in subjects without diabetes. Hence, the cardiovascular safety of antidiabetic 
drugs is of outmost importance. 
Both trials submitted with this application were designed to provide data on cardiovascular safety for 
liraglutide and insulin degludec, respectively.  
The LEADER trial was a CV outcome trial in patients with very high risk of CV events. In the recently 
concluded procedure for liraglutide (EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0042) the CHMP concluded that the LEADER 
trial has shown benefits on 3-point MACE, expanded MACE, and all-cause death and suggests benefits 
with respect to nephropathy and hypoglycaemia at the cost of possibly an increased incidence of pancreas 
carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and retinopathy. The incidence of the carcinomas is that low, that the 
benefits outweigh the risk. The benefits on glycaemic control have been established previously. Reference 
to the effects of liraglutide on cardiovascular events was added to the indication. 
The DEVOTE trial was also a CV outcome trial in patients at high risk of CV events. In the recently 
concluded procedure for insulin degludec (EMEA/H/C/002498/II/0028) the CHMP concluded that the data 
presented showed that IDeg did not alter the relative risk of CV disease and CV mortality when compared 
to IGlar in a population at high risk of CV events, since non-inferiority could be established. IGlar has 
previously been shown not to alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV mortality when compared to 
standard of care. The data from the DEVOTE trial is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC for insulin 
degludec.  
With this application, the MAH proposed to include the following wording in the indication “For study 
results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, and the 
populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
Both studies contribute with important data on the cardiovascular safety for each of the two components 
of IDegLira, however extrapolation of these outcomes to IDegLira has not been justified. In contrast to 
oral fixed dose combinations of antidiabetic drugs, IDegLira is titrated from a recommended starting dose 
of 10 U of IDeg and 0.36 mg of liraglutide to a maximum dose of 50 U of IDeg and 1.8 mg liraglutide. 
Thus patients on IDegLira may be exposed to (much) lower doses of liraglutide than investigated in the 
LEADER trial, where 85% of subjects were treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg. This raised concerns in case 
the effect observed in the LEADER trial is dose dependent. 
The possibility of extrapolation of the outcomes would also depend on whether the population studied in 
the LEADER trial corresponds to the target population for treatment with Xultophy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/380783/2018 
Page 70/73 
 
  
  
Although some data on the cardiovascular effect of concomitant treatment with liraglutide and insulin has 
been presented further analyses were requested as part of the justification for the claim.  
Other changes proposed with this application mainly related to updated safety information concerning 
liraglutide based on new safety data obtained with trial 3478. These changes were acceptable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data provided with this application provides important cardiovascular safety information on the 
monocomponents of Xultophy. These data do not indicate that the individual components carry any 
increased risk for cardiovascular events.  
The MAH considered the results from the LEADER and DEVOTE trials to be relevant also for the target 
population of Xultophy based on claims that there is an overlap in the patient populations and liraglutide 
doses in LEADER and the Xultophy phase 3 trials, and on post-hoc analyses of the LEADER and DEVOTE 
trials in patients using liraglutide in combination with a long-acting insulin.  
CHMP acknowledged that there was some, albeit incomplete, overlap between the population included in 
the LEADER trial and the target population for Xultophy, including with respect to liraglutide doses, even 
though a lower proportion in the target population for Xultophy is exposed to a daily dose of 1.8 mg 
compared to the LEADER trial. CHMP considered that evidence of CV safety could be extrapolated to the 
use of Xultophy since the CVOTs may represent a “worst case scenario” having included high risk patients 
and a maximal dose of liraglutide. Therefore, inclusion of some results from the LEADER and DEVOTE 
trials in section 5.1 of the SmPC was found to be adequate by CHMP.  
The data is however not sufficient in order to draw any conclusions on beneficial effects on cardiovascular 
events by Xultophy. 
In addition, safety data has been provided concerning certain safety issues related to liraglutide, including 
information on special populations. These data are relevant to Xultophy and updates to the product 
information are implemented.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xultophy remains positive and unchanged also taking into account effects on 
cardiovascular events.

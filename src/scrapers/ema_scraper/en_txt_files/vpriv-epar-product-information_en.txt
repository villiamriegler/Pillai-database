CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
VPRIV is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with type 1 Gaucher 
disease.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
VPRIV treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients with 
Gaucher disease.  
Posology 
The recommended dose is 60 Units/kg administered every other week.  
Dose adjustments can be made on an individual basis based on achievement and maintenance of 
therapeutic goals. Clinical studies have evaluated doses ranging from 15 to 60 Units/kg every other 
week. Doses higher than 60 Units/kg have not been studied. 
Patients currently treated with imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease 
may be switched to VPRIV, using the same dose and frequency. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old) 
Elderly patients may be treated within the same dose range (15 to 60 Units/kg) as other adult patients 
(see section 5.1).

Renal impairment 
No dosing adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment based on current knowledge 
of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of velaglucerase alfa (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosing adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment based on current 
knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of velaglucerase alfa (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Twenty of the 94 patients (21%) who received velaglucerase alfa during clinical studies were in the 
paediatric and adolescent age range (4 to 17 years). The safety and efficacy profiles were similar 
between paediatric and adult patients (see section 5.1 for further information).  
The safety and efficacy of velaglucerase alfa in children below the age of 4 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous infusion use only.  
To be administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. 
Must be administered through a 0.2 or 0.22 µm filter. 
Home administration under the supervision of a healthcare professional may be considered only for 
those patients who have received at least three infusions and were tolerating their infusions well. 
Appropriate medical support, including adequately trained personnel in emergency measures, should 
be readily available when velaglucerase alfa is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions 
occur, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment (see 
section 4.4). 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Severe allergic reaction to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of 
the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.  
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, have been reported in 
patients in clinical studies and in post-marketing experience. The majority of hypersensitivity 
reactions usually occur up to 12 hours post infusion. The most frequently reported symptoms of 
hypersensitivity include nausea, rash dyspnoea, back pain, chest discomfort (including chest 
tightness), urticaria, arthralgia, and headache. 
Infusion-related reactions 
An infusion-related reaction is defined as any adverse drug reaction occurring within 24 hours after 
the initiation of velaglucerase alfa infusion. Infusion-related reactions (IRR) were the most commonly 
observed adverse reactions in patients treated in clinical studies. An IRR often appears as a 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity reaction. The most frequently reported symptoms of hypersensitivity include nausea, 
rash, dyspnoea, back pain, chest discomfort (including chest tightness), urticaria, arthralgia, and 
headache. Symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis have been reported in patients in clinical studies and 
in post-marketing experience. Apart from symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions IRRs 
might show as fatigue, dizziness, pyrexia, blood pressure increase, pruritus, vision blurred, or 
vomiting. In treatment-naïve patients, the majority of infusion-related reactions occurred during the 
first 6 months of treatment. 
Prevention and management of infusion related reactions including hypersensitivity reactions  
The management of infusion-related reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, and 
include slowing the infusion rate, treatment with medicinal products such as antihistamines, 
antipyretics and/or corticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with increased infusion 
time. 
Due to the risk for hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support, 
including adequately trained personnel in emergency measures, should be readily available when 
velaglucerase alfa is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, in the clinic or home 
setting, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. For patients 
developing anaphylaxis in a home setting it should be considered to continue treatment in a clinical 
setting. 
Treatment should be approached with caution in patients who have exhibited symptoms of 
hypersensitivity to velaglucerase alfa or other enzyme replacement therapy. 
Pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in those 
cases where symptomatic treatment was required.  
Immunogenicity 
Antibodies may play a role in treatment-related reactions found with the use of velaglucerase alfa. To 
further evaluate the relationship, in cases of severe infusion-related reactions and in cases of lack or 
loss of effect, patients should be tested for the presence of antibodies and the results reported to the 
company. 
In the clinical studies for Marketing Authorisation one of 94 (1%) patients developed IgG-class 
antibodies to velaglucerase alfa. In this one event, the antibodies were determined to be neutralising in 
an in vitro assay. 
No patients developed IgE antibodies to velaglucerase alfa. 
No infusion related reactions were reported. 
Post-marketing phase 
During a post marketing extension study, one patient developed IgG antibodies to VPRIV. In addition, 
a few events of positive neutralising antibodies and lack of effect were reported post marketing. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 12.15 mg sodium per vial. This is equivalent to 0.6% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Patients who have Gaucher disease and become pregnant may experience a period of increased disease 
activity during pregnancy and the puerperium. A risk-benefit assessment is required for women with 
Gaucher disease who are considering pregnancy. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of velaglucerase alfa in pregnant women. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal 
development, parturition or postnatal development. Close monitoring of the pregnancy and clinical 
manifestations of Gaucher disease is necessary for the individualisation of therapy. Caution should be 
exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
There is insufficient information on the excretion of velaglucerase alfa or its metabolites in human 
milk. Velaglucerase is a synthetic form of beta-glucocerebrosidase, which is a normal component of 
human milk. Studies with other forms of the enzyme have found very low levels of the enzyme in 
breastmilk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from VPRIV taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies show no evidence of impaired fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
VPRIV has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most serious adverse reactions in patients in clinical studies were hypersensitivity reactions 
(2.1%). 
The most common adverse reactions were infusion-related reactions (39.4%). The most commonly 
observed symptoms of infusion-related reactions were: headache, dizziness, hypotension, 
hypertension, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and pyrexia/body temperature increased (see section 4.4 for 
further information). The only adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of treatment was an 
infusion-related reaction. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease are listed in Table 1. Information is 
presented by system organ class and frequency according to MedDRA convention. Frequency is 
defined as very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), and uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

was similar to that observed in adult patients.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited information available regarding overdose with velaglucerase alfa. In the majority of 
the cases reporting overdose, no additional adverse events were observed. However, in the event of 
accidental or intentional overdose, patients should be carefully observed and treatment should be 
symptomatic and supportive. There is no antidote available. The maximum dose of velaglucerase alfa 
in clinical studies was 60 Units/kg (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes, ATC code: 
A16AB10. 
Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene which 
results in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. This enzymatic deficiency 
causes an accumulation of glucocerebroside primarily in macrophages, giving rise to foam cells or 
"Gaucher cells". In this lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), clinical features are reflective of the 
distribution of Gaucher cells in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, skeleton, and lungs. The accumulation 
of glucocerebroside in the liver and spleen leads to organomegaly. Bone involvement results in 
skeletal abnormalities and deformities as well as bone pain crises. Deposits in the bone marrow and 
splenic sequestration lead to clinically significant anaemia and thrombocytopenia. 
The active substance of VPRIV is velaglucerase alfa, which is produced by gene activation technology 
in a human cell line. Velaglucerase alfa is a glycoprotein. The monomer is approximately 63 kDa, has 
497 amino acids, and the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring human enzyme, 
glucocerebrosidase. There are 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, four of which are occupied. 
Velaglucerase alfa is manufactured to contain predominantly high-mannose-type glycans to facilitate 
internalisation of the enzyme by the phagocytic target cells via the mannose receptor. 
Velaglucerase alfa supplements or replaces beta-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme that catalyses the 
hydrolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide in the lysosome, reducing the amount of 
accumulated glucocerebroside and correcting the pathophysiology of Gaucher disease. Velaglucerase 
alfa increases haemoglobin concentration and platelet counts and reduces liver and spleen volumes in 
patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. 
In studies 025EXT and 034, patients were offered home therapy. In study 025EXT, 7 of 10 patients 
received home therapy at least once during 60 months of treatment. In study 034, 25 of 40 patients 
received home therapy at least once during the 12-month study.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Studies in treatment naïve patients 
Study 025 was a 9 month, open-label study in 12 adult (≥18 years) patients who were naïve to ERT 
(defined as having not been treated with ERT for at least 12 months prior to study entry). 
Velaglucerase alfa was initially administered in a dose-escalating fashion in the first 3 patients (15, 30, 
60 Units/kg) and the 9 remaining patients began treatment with 60 Units/kg. 
Clinically meaningful improvements from baseline were observed in haemoglobin concentration and 
platelet counts as early as 3 months and in liver and spleen volumes at both 6 months and 9 months 
following the initiation of treatment with velaglucerase alfa. 
Ten patients who completed Study 025 enrolled in an open-label extension study (025EXT), 8 of 
whom completed the study. After a minimum of 12 months of continuous treatment with 
velaglucerase alfa, all patients qualified to have the dose of velaglucerase alfa reduced in a step-wise 
fashion from 60 to 30 Units/kg after achieving at least 2 of the 4 “Year 1” therapeutic goals of ERT for 
type 1 Gaucher disease. Patients received doses ranging from 30 to 60 Units/kg (median dose 
35 Units/kg) every other week for up to 84 months (7 years). Sustained clinical activity continued to 
be demonstrated during treatment as observed by improvements in haemoglobin concentrations and 
platelet counts and reduced liver and spleen volumes. 
By month 57, 8 out of the 8 patients had achieved a reduction of at least 2 points in the lumbar spine 
Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) score as assessed by MRI scan. Improvement from baseline in mean 
lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) Z-scores were observed at month 24 (0.4; 
95% CI 0.1, 0.7) and month 33 (0.4; 95% CI 0.2, 0.6), respectively. After seven years of treatment, the 
mean increase from baseline in Z-scores were 0.7 (95% CI 0.4, 1.0) for the lumbar spine and 0.5 (95% 
CI 0.2, 0.7) for the femoral neck. No patients were classified at a more severe WHO classification of 
bone density compared to baseline.   
Study 032 was a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group efficacy study that enrolled 
25 patients aged 4 years and older who were naïve to ERT (defined as having not been treated with 
ERT for at least 30 months prior to study entry). Patients were required to have Gaucher disease-
related anaemia and either thrombocytopenia or organomegaly. Patients were randomised to receive 
velaglucerase alfa at a dose of either 45 Units/kg (N=13) or 60 Units/kg (N=12) every other week.  
Velaglucerase alfa 60 Units/kg given intravenously every other week demonstrated clinically 
meaningful increases from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration (+2.4 g/dl) and platelet count 
(+50.9 x 109/l), liver volume was reduced from 1.46 to 1.22 times normal (mean reduction of 17%) 
and spleen volume was reduced from 14.0 to 5.75 times normal (mean reduction of 50%). Meaningful 
increases from baseline were observed in the 45 Units/kg dose group in haemoglobin concentration 
(+2.4 g/dl) and platelet count (+40.9 x 109/l), liver volume was reduced from 1.40 to 1.24 times 
normal (mean reduction of 6%) and spleen volume was reduced from 14.5 to 9.50 times normal (mean 
reduction of 40%). 
Study 039 was a 9-month, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority, active-comparator (imiglucerase) 
controlled, parallel-group efficacy study that enrolled 34 patients aged 4 years and older who were 
naïve to ERT (defined as having not been treated with ERT for at least 12 months prior to study entry). 
Patients were required to have Gaucher disease-related anaemia and either thrombocytopenia or 
organomegaly. Patients received either 60 Units/kg of velaglucerase alfa (N=17) or 60 Units/kg of 
imiglucerase (N=17) every other week. 
The mean absolute increase from baseline in haemoglobin concentrations was 1.624 g/dl (±0.223 SE) 
following 9 months of treatment with velaglucerase alfa. This increase in haemoglobin concentration 
was demonstrated to be clinically and statistically non-inferior to imiglucerase (mean treatment 
difference of change from baseline to 9 months [velaglucerase alfa – imiglucerase]: 0.135 g/dl). There 
were no statistically significant differences between velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase in changes in 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
platelet counts and liver and spleen volumes after 9 months of velaglucerase alfa treatment, and in the 
time to first haemoglobin response (defined as 1 g/dl increase from baseline). 
Study in patients switching from imiglucerase treatment to VPRIV 
Study 034 was a 12-month, open-label safety study that enrolled 40 patients aged 4 years and older 
who had been receiving treatment with imiglucerase at doses ranging from 15 to 60 Units/kg for a 
minimum of 30 consecutive months. Patients were required to have a stable dose of imiglucerase for at 
least 6 months prior to study enrolment. Treatment with velaglucerase alfa was administered as the 
same number of units and regimen as their imiglucerase dose. Haemoglobin concentration and platelet 
counts were evaluated as changes from baseline, which was defined as the end of the patient’s 
treatment with imiglucerase. 
In patients who switched from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa, haemoglobin concentrations and 
platelet counts were sustained at therapeutic levels through 12 months of treatment.  
Study 058 was an open-label clinical safety study in 211 patients including 205 patients previously 
treated with imiglucerase 6 treatment-naïve patients and 57 patients aged 65 years or older (56/57 had 
switched from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa). Patients transferring from imiglucerase were 
administered velaglucerase alfa infusions every other week at the same number of units as 
imiglucerase within the range of 15 to 60 Units/kg. Patients transferring from a dose of <15 Units/kg 
imiglucerase were administered 15 Units/kg of velaglucerase alfa.  
Patients previously treated with imiglucerase received a median of 8 velaglucerase alfa infusions with 
median duration of treatment of 15.1 weeks. The safety profile in these patients was similar to that 
observed in other clinical studies. Only 1 out of 163 patients assessed developed anti-velaglucerase 
alfa antibodies during the study. 
The mean haemoglobin concentration and platelet count of patients previously treated with 
imiglucerase were maintained throughout the study and remained within the reference intervals. 
Extension study 044 
A total of 95 patients (73 adult and 22 paediatric) who participated in studies 032, 034, and 039 
enrolled in the open label extension study and were treated with velaglucerase alfa. 57 patients were 
treatment naïve. All patients received at least 2 years of ERT and were followed for a mean of 
4.5 years (min. 2.3 years, max 5.8 years). 
In this study, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, liver volume and spleen volume were 
assessed in treatment-naïve patients after 24 months of treatment. The results are presented in Table 2.

Note: Imputation was applied to intermittent missing data. 
In this study, BMD was assessed using dual x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and femoral 
neck. Among 31 treatment-naïve adult patients treated with velaglucerase alfa, the mean lumbar spine 
BMD Z-score at baseline was -1.820 (95% CI: -2.21, -1.43) and increased by 0.62 (95% CI: 0.39, 
0.84) from baseline following 24 months of treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Similar results were 
seen in treatment-naïve patients who received 9 months of imiglucerase followed by velaglucerase alfa 
for 15 months. In patients who switched from long-term imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa, lumbar 
spine BMD was maintained at 24 months. In contrast, no significant change in femoral neck BMD was 
observed. 
In the paediatric population (ages 4 to 17 years studied), increases in the mean height Z-score were 
seen through 60 months of treatment in the overall treatment-naïve population, suggesting a beneficial 
treatment effect with velaglucerase alfa on linear growth. Similar treatment effects were seen through 
48 months in the paediatric population who received 9 months of imiglucerase followed by 
velaglucerase alfa. Paediatric subjects who switched from long-term imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa 
in study 034 had greater mean height Z-scores at baseline and their mean height Z-scores remained 
stable over time. 
These treatment effects on haemoglobin, platelet count, organ volumes, bone mineral density and 
height were maintained through the end of the study. 
Study 402 
Study 402 was a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm study that evaluated the effect of VPRIV on bone-
related pathology in 21 treatment naïve adult subjects with type 1 Gaucher disease. The primary 
efficacy analysis was conducted in 16 subjects that completed 24 months of VPRIV treatment with a 
median age of 46 years at baseline and baseline mean (SD) BMD Z-score of -1.93 (0.876).  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to 24 months in LS BMD 
Z-score as measured by the DXA method. A positive trend for the primary efficacy endpoint was seen 
[change in LS BMD Z-score baseline to 24 months mean (SD) 0.17 (0.394), 95% CI -0.04, 0.38; but 
the effect was not statistically significant (p-value 0.1077). No relevant effect of VPRIV on LS BMD 
Z-score was seen after 1 year of treatment. 
The secondary endpoints [ITT population: OC (observed cases)] as seen in Table 3 below were in line 
with the previous studies.

The safety profile was consistent with data from previous studies as well; no new safety signals were 
observed. 
Paediatric population 
Use in the age group 4 to 17 is supported by evidence from controlled studies in adults and paediatric 
[20 of 94 (21%)] patients. The safety and efficacy profiles were similar between paediatric and adult 
patients. The studies allowed the inclusion of patients 2 years and older and the safety and efficacy 
profiles are expected to be similar down to the age of 2 years. However, no data are available for 
children under the age of 4 years. The effect on height was assessed in the study 044 (see section 5.1, 
extension study 044). 
Phase I/II study HGT-GCB-068 was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa 
ERT in treatment naïve children and adolescents with type 3 Gaucher disease. This was a multicentre, 
open-label study in which 60 U/kg of velaglucerase alfa was administered by intravenous infusion 
every other week (EOW) over 12 months in 6 patients (2 to 17 years of age at enrolment) with a 
confirmed diagnosis of type 3 Gaucher disease. 
In this small, exploratory study, the non-neurological efficacy findings and the safety profile of 
intravenous velaglucerase alfa in type 3 Gaucher patients were consistent with those observed in 
patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. There was no indication of significant improvements of the 
neurological manifestations of type 3 Gaucher disease except for one patient in this study. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
VPRIV in all subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 Gaucher disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There were no apparent pharmacokinetic differences between male and female patients with type 1 
Gaucher disease. None of the subjects in the pharmacokinetic studies were positive for 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies on the days of pharmacokinetic evaluation. Therefore, it was not 
possible to evaluate the effect of antibody response on the pharmacokinetic profile of velaglucerase 
alfa. 
Absorption 
Velaglucerase alfa serum concentrations rose rapidly for the first 20 minutes of the 60-minute infusion 
before levelling off, and Cmax was typically attained between 40 and 60 minutes after the start of the 
infusion. After the end of the infusion, velaglucerase alfa serum concentrations fell rapidly in a 
monophasic or biphasic fashion with a mean t1/2 ranging from 5 to 12 minutes at doses of 15, 30, 45, 
and 60 Units/kg. 
Distribution 
Velaglucerase alfa exhibited an approximately linear (i.e. first-order) pharmacokinetic profile, and 
Cmax and AUC increased approximately proportional to the dose over the dose range 15 to 60 Units/kg. 
The steady state volume of distribution was approximately 10% of the body weight. The high 
clearance of velaglucerase alfa from serum (mean 6.7 to 7.6 ml/min/kg) is consistent with the rapid 
uptake of velaglucerase alfa into macrophages via mannose receptors. 
Elimination 
The range of velaglucerase alfa clearance in paediatric patients (N=7, age range 4 to 17 years) was 
contained within the range of clearance values in adult patients (N=15, age range 19 to 62 years). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development (see section 4.6).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What VPRIV is and what it is used for 
VPRIV is a long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. 
Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder caused by a missing or defective enzyme named 
glucocerebrosidase. When this enzyme is missing or does not work properly, a substance called 
glucocerebroside builds up inside cells in the body. The build-up of this material causes the signs and 
symptoms found in Gaucher disease. 
VPRIV contains a substance called velaglucerase alfa which is designed to replace the missing or 
defective enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, in patients with Gaucher disease. 
2.  What you need to know before VPRIV is used 
Do not use VPRIV  
- 
if you are severely allergic to velaglucerase alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before VPRIV is used 
- 
If you are treated with VPRIV, you may experience side effects during or following the infusion 
(see section 4, possible side effects). These are called infusion related reactions and might 
appear as a hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms like nausea, rash, difficulty in breathing, 
back pain, chest discomfort (chest tightness), hives, joint pain or headache. 
Apart from symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions infusion-related reactions might show as 
dizziness, high blood pressure, tiredness, fever, itching, blurry vision, or vomiting. 
If you experience any of the symptoms, you must tell your doctor immediately. 
You may be given additional medicines to treat or help prevent future reactions. These 
medicines may include antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids. 
If the reaction is severe, your doctor will stop the intravenous infusion immediately and start 
giving you appropriate medical treatment. 
If the reactions are severe and/or there is a loss of effect from this medicine, your doctor will 
perform a blood test to check for antibodies which may affect the outcome of your treatment  
- 
- 
- 
- 
32 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Your doctor or nurse may decide to continue to administer VPRIV even if you experience any 
infusion related-reaction. Your condition will be closely monitored. 
Tell your doctor if you have previously experienced an infusion-related reaction with other ERT for 
Gaucher disease. 
Children 
Do not use in children under the age of 4 years because there is no experience of using the medicine in 
this age group. 
Other medicines and VPRIV 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Pregnancy  
Gaucher disease may become more active in a woman during pregnancy and for a few weeks after 
birth. Women with Gaucher disease who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should talk with their 
doctor before this medicine is used. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether VPRIV can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or considering 
breast-feeding, you should talk to your doctor before this medicine is used. Your doctor will then help 
you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop using VPRIV, considering the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of VPRIV to the mother. 
Driving and using machines 
VPRIV has no or negligible influence on your ability to drive or use machines. 
VPRIV contains sodium 
This medicine contains 12.15 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3.  How VPRIV is used 
This medicine is only to be used under appropriate medical supervision of a doctor who is 
knowledgeable in the treatment of Gaucher disease. It is given by a doctor or nurse by intravenous 
infusion. 
Dose 
The recommended dose is 60 Units/kg given every other week.  
If you are currently being treated for Gaucher disease with another ERT and your doctor wants to 
change you to VPRIV, you can initially receive VPRIV at the same dose and frequency you had been 
receiving the other ERT.  
Use in children and adolescents 
VPRIV may be given to children and adolescents (4 to 17 years of age) at the same dose and 
frequency as in adults.  
Use in elderly 
VPRIV may be given to the elderly (aged over 65 years) at the same dose and frequency as in adults. 
Response to treatment 
Your doctor will monitor your response to treatment and may change your dose (up or down) over 
time. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are tolerating your infusions well in the clinic, your doctor or nurse may administer your 
infusions at home. 
Administration 
VPRIV is supplied in a vial as a packed powder which is mixed with sterile water and further diluted 
in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion prior to intravenous infusion.  
After preparation, your doctor or nurse will give the medicine to you through a drip into a vein (by 
intravenous infusion) over a period of 60 minutes.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only. 
VPRIV is a powder for solution for infusion. It requires reconstitution and dilution and is intended for 
intravenous infusion only. VPRIV is for single–use only and is administered through a 0.2 or 0.22 µm 
filter. Discard any unused solution. VPRIV should not be infused with other medicines in the same 
infusion as the compatibility in solution with other medicines has not been evaluated. The total volume 
of infusion should be delivered over a period of 60 minutes.  
Use aseptic technique. 
Prepare VPRIV as follows: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Determine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient’s weight and 
the prescribed dose. 
Remove the required vials from the refrigerator. Reconstitute each vial using sterile water for 
injections: 
Vial size 
400 Units 
Water for injections 
4.3 ml 
Upon reconstitution, mix vials gently. Do not shake. 
Prior to dilution, visually inspect the solution in the vials; the solution should be clear to slightly 
opalescent and colourless; do not use if the solution is discoloured, or if foreign particulate 
matter is present. 
5.  Withdraw the calculated volume of medicine from the appropriate number of vials. Some 
solution will remain in the vial: 
Vial size 
400 Units 
Extractable volume 
4.0 ml 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. 
Dilute the total volume required in 100 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
infusion. Mix gently. Do not shake. Initiate the infusion within 24 hours from the time of 
reconstitution. 
From a microbiological point of view, use the medicine immediately. If you do not immediately, in-
use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user. Do not exceed 24 hours 
at 2 C to 8 C. 
Do not dispose of the medicine via waste water or household waste. Dispose of any unused medicine 
or waste material in accordance with local requirements.

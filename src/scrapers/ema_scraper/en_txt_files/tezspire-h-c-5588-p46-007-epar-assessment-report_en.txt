1.  Introduction 
On 9th December 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Tezspire (tezepelumab), 
110mg/mL, solution for injection, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Tezepelumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2λ that specifically binds to Thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP) and prevents its interaction with the TSLP receptor (TSLPR). In vitro, 
tezepelumab causes a dose-dependent inhibition of TSLP induced signal transducers and activators of 
transcription (STAT) activation and cell proliferation, confirming its potency in blocking the functional 
pathways of TSLP mediated inflammation. 
Tezepelumab received a marketing authorisation as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled despite high dose 
inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment valid throughout the 
EU on 19 September 2022. 
The MAH stated that Study D5180C00031, titled ‘a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel 
group, placebo controlled, Phase IIIb study to evaluate the potential effect of tezepelumab on the 
humoral immune response to seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccination in adolescent and young 
adult participants with moderate to severe asthma’ (VECTOR) is a standalone study. 
The MAH plans to submit updates to section 4.5 of the SmPC in a future post-approval type II variation 
to provide additional information to healthcare professionals regarding seasonal influenza virus 
vaccination of patients treated with Tezspire. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Study intervention in the submitted study included tezepelumab and placebo. 
• 
• 
Tezepelumab 210 mg was administered via SC injections (accessorised pre-filled syringe 
[APFS]) every 4 weeks. 
Placebo was administered via SC injections (APFS) every 4 weeks. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study D5180C00031 
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, Phase IIIb study to 
evaluate the potential effect of tezepelumab on the humoral immune response to seasonal 
quadrivalent influenza vaccination in adolescent and young adult participants with moderate to severe 
asthma (VECTOR).

Description 
This Phase IIIb study was conducted to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on the humoral response to 
seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine in adolescents and young adults with moderate to severe 
asthma. The study also evaluated the PK and immunogenicity response in participants, the impact of 
tezepelumab on quality of life of the participants, and the proportion of participants with asthma 
exacerbations. 
This was a Phase IIIb, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study 
designed to investigate the potential effect of tezepelumab (210 mg subcutaneous [SC] every 4 weeks 
[Q4W]) on antibody responses following seasonal quadrivalent influenza virus vaccination in patients 
with moderate to severe asthma in the fall/winter 2021-2022 in the USA. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo SC Q4W, 
administered at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. All potential patients were assigned a unique enrolment 
number using an interactive voice response system or interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS). 
The study comprised the following study periods and visits: 
•  Screening period of 2 to 3 weeks (Visits 1 and 2) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment period (Visit 3 [Week 0] to Visit 6 [Week 12]): Patients were randomised at Visit 3 
(Week 0) to receive either tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo by SC injection at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 
and 12 
End of treatment [EOT] Visit (Visit 7 [Week 16]) 
Investigational product discontinuation (IPD) Visit (if applicable upon discontinuation of study 
intervention, including patient withdrawal) 
Follow-up visit and End of Study Visit (Visit 8 [Week 28]) 
Figure 1 shows the design of the study and the sequence of treatment periods. 
Patients received a single dose of inactivated quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine intramuscular at 
Week 12 before they received the fourth dose of study intervention. Serum samples for evaluation of 
antibody response were drawn at Week 12 (pre-vaccination) and at Week 16 (4 weeks post-
vaccination) when humoral response to the vaccination was expected to be fully developed. 
Patients were maintained on their currently prescribed ICS-LABA therapies without change from 
enrolment throughout the screening and treatment period. If asthma exacerbations occurred during 
the treatment period, patients could be treated with oral or other systemic corticosteroids or other 
asthma therapies according to standard practice.

Methods 
Study participants 
Participants with documented physician-diagnosed moderate to severe asthma for at least 12 months 
prior to Visit 1, male or female, aged between 12 to 21 years (inclusive), with a body weight of ≥ 40 kg 
were eligible for inclusion in this study. 
Treatments 
Tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks to adolescents and 
young adults with moderate to severe asthma for 16 weeks, for a total of 4 doses. The 210 mg dosage 
is the same dosage that has been approved for adults and adolescents in the US and EU.  
Participants received a single dose of inactivated quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine IM at Week 
12, on the same day as the fourth dose of study intervention. Humoral response following influenza 
vaccination was assessed at Week 16.

Sample size 
Approximately 100 patients were planned to be randomised into 2 treatment groups (50 in each 
tezepelumab and placebo group). Overall, 70 patients were randomised into this study, 35 patients 
each to the tezepelumab and placebo group. This was lower than the planned goal of approximately

100 randomised patients. The recruitment period was short due to the need to complete recruitment 
during the influenza season. Site initiation was slower than expected, truncating the recruitment 
period. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some sites did not participate because they were not 
willing to wait to administer the influenza vaccine per protocol to their patients with asthma. 
The study was conducted in 15 centres in the United States. The first patient was enrolled (consented) 
in this study on 23 August 2021 and the first patient was randomised on 09 September 2021.The 
primary database lock was on 23 May 2022 and final database lock was on 22 July 2022. Last patient 
completed last study visit on 18 July 2022. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
All potential patients were assigned a unique enrolment number via using an IVRS/IWRS. After 
confirming eligibility, each patient was assigned a unique randomisation code via the IVRS/IWRS. 
Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo SC Q4W, administered at 
Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. Randomisation was monitored to ensure at least 50% of the enrolled 
participants are between the ages of 12 to 17 years. 
Withdrawn patients were not replaced. 
This was a double-blind study in which tezepelumab and placebo were not visually distinct from each 
other. All packaging and labelling of study intervention was done in such way as to ensure blinding for 
all Sponsor and investigational site staff. Neither the patient nor any of the Investigators or Sponsor 
staff who were involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the patients were 
aware of the treatment received. Since tezepelumab and placebo were not visually distinct, study 
intervention was handled by a qualified person (eg, pharmacist or study nurse) at the study centre. 
Statistical Methods 
No formal statistical hypotheses were tested in this study. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on the humoral immune 
response following seasonal influenza virus vaccination in adolescent and young adult patients with 
moderate to severe asthma. 
The statistical analyses of each of the 4 primary variables were performed separately by strain and by 
assay; except for the Influenza A H3N2-strain, where only the MN assay was performed owing to the 
known low haemagglutination effect of the strain. Vaccine immunogenicity analysis set was used for 
the analyses of primary endpoints. No adjustment of multiplicity was performed. 
Geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) and GMTs were summarised by influenza virus strain and 
treatment group. Least square (LS) geometric mean ratios of GMFRs and GMTs between treatment 
groups (influenza vaccine divided by tezepelumab and influenza vaccine) were calculated via an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model on the log-transformed variable, adjusting for treatment group 
and age stratum (adolescents aged 12 to 17 year or young adults aged 18 to 21 years). The LS 
geometric mean ratios were provided with associated 90% CIs. 
The antibody response to the influenza vaccine was defined as a ≥ 4-fold rise in HAI or a ≥ 4-fold rise in 
MN from Week 12 (pre-vaccination antibody measure) to Week 16 (EOT). 
The proportions of patients who achieved a post-vaccination antibody titre response at Week 16 (EOT) 
were presented. Corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CIs were summarised by treatment group 
and by assay.

The proportion of patients who achieved a post-vaccination HAI or MN antibody titre ≥ 40 at Week 16 
(EOT) and the corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CIs were summarised by treatment group 
and by assay. 
The secondary objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity of 
tezepelumab. PK analysis set was used for the PK summaries and the Safety analysis set was used for 
the immunogenicity summaries. 
All safety variables were summarised descriptively using the Safety analysis set. 
Results 
Participation flow 
Of the 81 patients enrolled, 70 patients were randomised into this study (tezepelumab group and 
placebo group 35 patients each). Of the 11 enrolled patients who were not randomised, the most 
common reason for screen failure was lack of evidence of asthma as per inclusion criterion 4 (5 
patients). One participant withdrew consent during screening and was reported as "withdrawn by 
subject" not "screen failure". 
All 70 randomised patients received study intervention. Overall, 66 (94.3%) randomised patients 
completed treatment, 32 (91.4%) patients in the tezepelumab group and 34 (97.1%) patients in the 
placebo group. Of the 4 patients who discontinued treatment, 1 patient died (placebo group), 1 patient 
was lost to follow-up (tezepelumab group) and 2 patients prematurely discontinued study intervention, 
but completed all study assessments.

Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The demographic characteristics of study patients are summarised for the Full analysis set in Table 2. 
Overall, the mean (SD) age was 16.5 (3.0) years. Of the randomised patients, 61.4% were in the ≥ 12 
to < 18-year age group, as per randomisation set up, which was to ensure at least 50% of adolescents 
among the patients. The majority of patients were male (64.3%), of White race (67.1%), and of not 
Hispanic or Latino origin (74.3%).  
The patients demographic characteristics were similar between the treatment groups.

Table 2: Demographic characteristics (Full Analysis Set) 
Note: The number of participants with data (ie, “Total” row) was used as the denominator for calculating percentages for all 
demography data. 
The patient characteristics at baseline are summarised for the Full analysis set in Table 3. Overall, the 
mean (SD) height was 169.85 (11.15) cm. The mean (SD) weight was lower in the tezepelumab group 
compared to the placebo group (67.22 [17.44] kg vs. 81.49 [21.52] kg). 
Similarly, the mean (SD) BMI was lower in the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo group 
(23.27 [4.65] kg/m2 vs. 27.95 [6.96] kg/m2) and there was a smaller proportion of patients with BMI 
≥ 30 in the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo group (11.4% vs. 37.1%).

Disease-related treatments 
Relevant disease-related treatments at Visit 1 are summarised for the Full analysis set in Table 4. 
The majority of patients took medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (63 [90.0%] patients). Relevant 
disease-related medications taken at Visit 1 were similar between the treatment groups. There was 1 
patient in the placebo group who was not on stable treatment with ICS and LABA (was only on ICS 
alone).

Relevant disease-related treatments at visit 1 of the vaccine immunogenicity analysis set were similar 
to those of the full analysis set.  
Lung Function and Asthma Characteristics 
Overall, mean baseline pre-BD FEV1 was 2.732 L; mean percent predicted normal FEV1 was 77.45%, 
mean post-BD FEV1/FVC was 81.644%, and mean percent FEV1 reversibility was 22.548%. Lung 
function variables at baseline were similar between the treatment groups. 
Overall, the proportion of patients with historical reversibility assessment was 18.6%. The mean (SD) 
time since asthma diagnosis was 13.374 (4.443) years and the mean (SD) number of exacerbations 
per patient in the last 12 months was 0.7 (1.2). 
Asthma characteristics at study entry were similar between treatment groups. Most patients in both 
the tezepelumab and placebo groups had either 0, 1 or 2 exacerbations in the last 12 months. There 
were 6 patients in the placebo group who had up to 3 or 5 exacerbations. Compared to the 
tezepelumab group, more patients in the placebo group also required systemic corticosteroid treatment 
for their exacerbations. These minor differences did not impact the primary analysis. 
Number analysed 
The analysis sets and the numbers of patients in each analysis set are summarised in Table 5. 
Of the 70 patients randomised, all were included in the Full analysis set and Safety analysis set (35 
[100.0%] patients in each treatment group). 
Two (5.7%) patients in each treatment group were excluded from the Vaccine immunogenicity analysis 
set. These patients did not receive an influenza vaccine (1 patient in each treatment group), had an 
influenza infection prior to Visit 7 (1 patient in the placebo group), or had no serum sample for 
antibodies to influenza vaccine taken at Visit 6 (1 patient in the tezepelumab group). 
Three (8.6%) patients in the tezepelumab group were excluded from the PK analysis set due to 
unavailability of PK results (no post-dose samples were obtained [1 patient] or no post-dose samples 
had measurable concentrations of Tezepelumab. 
All decisions on the inclusion or exclusion of patients from analyses were made while the data were still 
blinded.

Efficacy results 
Primary Endpoint 
The antibody response to the influenza vaccination containing the following 4 strains was examined: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Influenza A H1N1 strain: A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)-pdm09-like virus 
Influenza A H3N2 strain: A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus (HAI assay was not 
performed for H3N2 strain due to the known low haemagglutination effect) 
Influenza B Yamagata lineage strain: B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus 
Influenza B Victoria lineage strain: B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus

Geometric mean fold rises and GMTs were summarised by influenza virus strain and treatment group. 
The LS geometric mean ratio of GMFRs and GMTs between treatment groups (influenza vaccine divided 
by tezepelumab and influenza vaccine) was calculated via an ANCOVA mode on the log-transformed 
variable, adjusting for treatment group and age stratum (adolescents aged 12 to 17 years or young 
adults aged 18 to 21 years). The HAI assay was not performed for H3N2 strain due to the known low 
haemagglutination effect. 
A summary of influenza-strain specific antibody responses for HAI (GMT at Week 12 [pre-vaccination] 
and Week 16, GMFR at Week 16) is presented in Table 6. 
The results of the ANCOVA model of influenza-strain antibody response geometric mean ratios for HAI 
are presented in Table 7. 
For all strains, the antibody response between treatment groups was generally similar. The 90% CIs of 
the geometric LS mean ratio (placebo/tezepelumab) included 1 with the exception of Influenza A H1N1 
strain GMFR (geometric LS mean ratio 0.65; 90% CI 0.43, 0.98). 
For the Influenza A H1N1 strain, the estimated geometric LS mean GMT and GMFR at Week 16 were 
higher for the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo group. 
For the Influenza B Yamagata strain and Influenza B Victoria strain, the estimated geometric LS mean 
GMT and GMFR at Week 16 were similar between the tezepelumab group and the placebo group.

Post-vaccination influenza-strain specific antibody response: ≥ 4-fold rise from Week 12 to 
Week 16 
The antibody response to the influenza vaccine was defined as a ≥ 4-fold rise in HAI or a ≥ 4-fold rise in 
MN from Week 12 (pre-vaccination antibody measure) to Week 16 (EOT). 
Haemagglutination-inhibition 
A summary of influenza-strain specific antibody rise ≥ 4-fold from Week 12 (pre-vaccination) to Week 
16 for HAI is provided in Table 10. 
For the Influenza A H1N1 strain, a ≥ 4-fold rise in antibody response from Week 12 to Week 16 for HAI 
was observed for the majority of patients in both treatment groups; this response was numerically 
higher in the tezepelumab group (78.8% of patients) compared to the placebo group (51.5% of 
patients). 
For the other strains, the proportions of patients with antibody rise ≥ 4-fold were similar between 
treatment groups (for Influenza B Yamagata strain, 15.2% of patients in both treatment groups;

Microneutralisation 
A summary of influenza-strain specific antibody titre ≥ 40 at Week 16 for MN is provided in Table 13. 
For the Influenza A H1N1, Influenza A H3N2, and Influenza B Yamagata strains, almost all patients (≥ 
93.9%) had an antibody titre ≥ 40 at Week 16. The response was similar between both treatment 
groups within each strain. 
For Influenza B Victoria strain, a smaller proportion of patients had antibody titres ≥ 40, with a similar 
response between both treatment groups (78.8% of patients in the Tezepelumab group, 81.8% of 
patients in the placebo group).

Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary objective was to assess the PK and immunogenicity of tezepelumab, which was done by 
measuring serum trough tezepelumab concentrations and ADA. 
Summary of Pharmacokinetic Results (PK analysis set) 
After administration with tezepelumab, the mean serum trough concentration increased over time, 
approaching steady-state by Week 12. At Weeks 12 and 16 (EOT), the arithmetic mean serum trough 
concentrations of tezepelumab were 29.8 μg/mL and 30.6 μg/mL, respectively. 
Summary of Immunogenicity Results (Safety analysis set) 
There were no anti-drug antibody (ADA)-positive patients among 35 patients in the tezepelumab 
group. Thus, ADA prevalence (percentage of ADA-positive patients in the group) and ADA incidence 
(percentage of treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients in the group) were both 0%. In the placebo 
group, ADA prevalence was 11.4% (4 of 35 patients). The median of maximum ADA titres was low at 
134.40.

Safety results 
Tezepelumab was well tolerated in adolescent and young adult patients with moderate to severe 
asthma, there were no safety findings of concern, and there were no clinically meaningful differences 
in the safety results between the tezepelumab and placebo group.   
The safety findings are summarised as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The majority of patients in each treatment group received the planned 4 study intervention 
administrations (tezepelumab group, 32 [91.4%] patients; placebo group, 34 [97.1%] 
patients). All patients except 2 (1 patient in each treatment group) were administered 
influenza virus vaccine. 
The proportion of patients who experienced adverse events (AEs) and AEs by system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) were balanced between both treatment groups. 
There were 21 (60.0%) patients each in the tezepelumab group and in the placebo group who 
experienced at least 1 AE. 
There was 1 (2.9%) patient with an AE with outcome of death (fatal stab wound to the chest) 
in the placebo group. This event was the only serious adverse event (SAE) in the study. 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention. 
The most frequently reported AEs by SOC were infections and infestations (14 [40.0%] 
patients in the tezepelumab group, 15 [42.9%] patients in the placebo group). The most 
common AE by PT was Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (8 [22.9%] patients in each 
treatment group). 
•  Hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions during the on-study period were reported 
in the tezepelumab group only; 1 (2.9%) patient had urticaria (mild intensity) and 1 (2.9%) 
patient had injection site pain (mild intensity). Both events were assessed as causally-related 
to study intervention by the Investigator. 
•  Severe infections (requiring systemic antiviral treatment) during the on-study period were 
reported in the placebo group only; 1 (2.9%) patient had COVID-19 (moderate intensity) and 
1 (2.9%) patient had influenza (mild intensity). Both events were assessed as not causally 
related to study intervention by the Investigator. No serious infections were reported. 
•  Most patients had events of mild or moderate intensity during the on-study period, with the 
exception of 1 patient in the placebo group who had a severe AE (fatal stab wound). 
• 
Three (8.6%) patients in tezepelumab group and 1 (2.9%) patient in the placebo group had 
AEs assessed as causally-related to study intervention during the on-study period.  These 
events included headache, injection site pain, lethargy, myalgia, urinary tract infection, and 
urticaria in the tezepelumab group and headache, cough, and fatigue in the placebo group. 
•  With the exception of expected pharmacodynamic effects for eosinophils, there were no 
clinically important trends or changes on-study compared to baseline in haematology, clinical 
chemistry, and urinalysis parameters. There were no clinically significant vital signs or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Tezepelumab is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents 12 years and 
older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. In the pivotal studies (Phase III 
NAVIGATOR and Phase IIb PATHWAY) tezepelumab has been shown to decrease IgE levels; however, 
its administration did not affect IgG, IgM, or IgA. Due to its immunomodulating effect, it is possible 
that tezepelumab could affect functioning of the immune system. This Phase IIIb study was conducted 
to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on the humoral response to seasonal quadrivalent influenza 
vaccine in adolescents and young adults with moderate to severe asthma. This is a descriptive study 
and no formal hypothesis testing was planned. The study recruited 70 subjects, and overall, 66 
(94.3%) of randomised patients completed treatment, 32 (91.4%) patients in the tezepelumab group 
and 34 (97.1%) patients in the placebo group. In relation to the 4 patients who discontinued 
treatment, the MAH clarified that of the 4 patients who discontinued treatment, all of them 
discontinued treatment before the Week 12 vaccination visit. Of the total subject cohort 43 were in the 
12-17 years of age cohort. The mean (SD) age was 16.5 (3.0) years. No separate analysis of the 
paediatric cohort was initially provided. The MAH subsequently provided the efficacy and safety data 
specific to the paediatric cohort. The results for the paediatric cohort are similar to those observed for 
the overall study population. 
Tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks to subjects with 
moderate to severe asthma for 16 weeks, for a total of 4 doses. The 210 mg dosage is the same 
dosage that has been approved for adults and adolescents in the US and EU. Participants received a 
single dose of inactivated quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine IM at Week 12, on the same day as 
the fourth dose of study intervention. Humoral response following influenza vaccination was assessed 
at Week 16. 
Demographic characteristics, medical history, and use of concomitant medications were balanced 
between both treatment groups and were typical of a population of adolescent and young adult 
patients with moderate to severe asthma. Patients weight in the placebo group was higher and there 
were more patients with a BMI ≥ 30 compared to the tezepelumab group (37.1% vs 11.4%). A post-
hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess whether the difference in baseline BMI between the 
tezepelumab group and placebo group influenced the primary endpoint analysis. The results of this 
sensitivity analysis were similar to the primary analysis of the full Vaccine immunogenicity analysis set. 
Post-vaccination strain-specific HAI antibody GMTs and GMFRs were measured for Influenza A H1N1, 
Influenza B Yamagata lineage, and Influenza B Victoria lineage strains. The HAI assay was not 
performed for H3N2 strain due to the known low haemagglutination effect. Post-vaccination strain-
specific MN antibody GMTs and GMFRs were measured for Influenza A H1N1, Influenza A H3N2, 
Influenza B Yamagata lineage, and Influenza B Victoria lineage strains. Antibody GMFRs and GMTs 
were measured from Week 12 to Week 16.  
For both assays and for all strains, the 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratio (placebo/tezepelumab) 
included 1 with the exception of the Influenza A H1N1 strain, for which the GMFR response for the HAI 
assay in the tezepelumab treatment arm was greater than in the placebo treatment arm (geometric LS 
mean ratio 0.65; 90% CI 0.43, 0.98). It was not clear if this result could be considered a chance 
finding or if there is a plausible scientific explanation for the observation. Nevertheless, based on the 
overall findings of the VECTOR study this was considered most likely to be a chance finding. 
The responses measured as GMTs and GMFRs at Week 16 varied across influenza strains and assays 
but were in general similar between treatment groups. The proportions of patients with ≥ 4-fold rise 
from Week 12 (pre-vaccination) to Week 16 (post-vaccination) varied across strains and assays but 
were, in general, similar across treatment groups.   
The interpretation of results is limited, to some degree, by the small study numbers (N=33 in each 
arm for the vaccine analysis set) however, from the data presented it appears that tezepelumab did

not suppress humoral immune response after influenza vaccination in patients with asthma and that 
the humoral antibody responses induced by seasonal influenza virus vaccination measured by HAI and 
MN assays were generally similar between tezepelumab and placebo groups. No suppression of 
response in patients treated with tezepelumab across the endpoints assessed was evident in this 
study. 
The safety findings from the study indicate that tezepelumab was well tolerated in adolescent and 
young adult patients with moderate to severe asthma. There were no safety findings of concern, and 
there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety results between the tezepelumab and 
placebo group.   
This study recruited patients between the ages of 12 – 21 years. There was no presentation of data 
specific to the paediatric cohort. Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has presented data specific to the 
paediatric cohort for the VECTOR Study. The results demonstrate that the antibody response in the 
subject population population 12 - < 18yrs are similar to those observed in the overall population. 
Although the interpretation of results is limited, to some degree, by the small study numbers, it 
appears that tezepelumab did not suppress humoral immune response after influenza vaccination in 
paediatric patients with asthma. The safety results for the adolescent cohort are similar to those 
observed for the overall study population. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In the context of this PAM for a completed paediatric study for Tezspire (tezepelumab) in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, the MAH has met their obligations. 
The results for the VECTOR study demonstrate that the antibody response in the subject population 
population 12 - < 18yrs are similar to those observed in the overall population. Although the 
interpretation of results is limited, to some degree, by the small study numbers, it appears that 
tezepelumab did not suppress humoral immune response after influenza vaccination in paediatric 
patients with asthma. The safety results for the adolescent cohort are similar to those observed for the 
overall study population. Based on the results of the VECTOR study the MAH has submitted a Type II 
variation proposing to update section 4.5 of the SmPC to provide additional information to healthcare 
professionals regarding seasonal influenza virus vaccination of patients treated with Tezspire. This is 
being assessed under procedure EMEA/H/C/005588/II/0008.

4.  CHMP Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The MAH is requested to provide separate primary efficacy data for the paediatric cohort (12 to 
<18yrs). 
2.  The MAH is requested to summarise and discuss the safety findings in the paediatric cohort 
compared to overall safety findings. 
3.  With respect to the 4 patients who discontinued treatment, please clarify the timing of these 
discontinuations and whether or not they occurred before or after the Week 12 vaccination 
visit. 
4.  In relation to the results for the Influenza A H1N1 strain; the GMFR response for the HAI assay 
in the tezepelumab treatment arm was greater than in the placebo treatment arm.  The MAH is 
asked to discuss whether this is a considered a chance finding or if there is a plausible scientific 
explanation for the result. 
The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clock stop. 
5.  MAH responses to CHMP Request for supplementary 
information 
1.  The MAH is requested to provide separate primary efficacy data for the paediatric 
cohort (12 to < 18yrs). 
Summary of MAH Response 
A total of 70 subjects were randomised in the VECTOR study. Of the 70 randomised subjects, 66 
were included in the efficacy analysis, of which 61% (20 in each of the treatment groups) were 
adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age. The efficacy results for adolescents are similar to that 
observed for the overall study population. 
Post-vaccination influenza-strain specific antibody GMFRs and GMTs 
Haemagglutination-inhibition 
In adolescents, the antibody response at Week 16 between treatment groups was generally similar 
for all strains. The 90% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratio (placebo/tezepelumab) included 1 with 
the exception of Influenza A H1N1 strain GMFR (geometric LS mean ratio 0.58; 90% CI 0.37, 
0.92). For the Influenza A H1N1 strain, the estimated geometric LS mean GMT and GMFR at Week 
16 were higher for the tezepelumab group compared to the placebo group. For the Influenza B 
Yamagata strain and Influenza B Victoria strain, the estimated geometric LS mean GMT and GMFR 
at Week 16 were similar between the Tezepelumab group and the placebo group (Figure 2).

CHMP’s Comments 
As requested, the MAH has presented data specific to the paediatric cohort for the VECTOR Study. The 
results demonstrate that the antibody response in the subject population population 12 - < 18yrs are 
similar to those observed in the overall population. Although the interpretation of results is limited, to 
some degree, by the small study numbers, it appears that tezepelumab did not suppress humoral 
immune response after influenza vaccination in paediatric patients with asthma.

2.  The MAH is requested to summarise and discuss the safety findings in the paediatric 
cohort compared to overall safety findings. 
Summary of MAH Response 
In the overall study population, 21 (60%) patients in each of the treatment groups (tezepelumab and 
placebo) experienced adverse events in the on-study period. The most frequently reported AEs by SOC 
were infections and infestations and the most frequently reported AE by preferred term was COVID-19, 
which was reported in 8 (22.9%) patients in each of the treatment groups (Table 18).

In the adolescent cohort (12 to < 18 years of age), 12 (54.5%) patients in the Tezepelumab treatment 
group and 14 (66.7%) patients in the placebo group experienced AEs (Table 18). The most frequently 
reported AEs by SOC were infections and infestations (Table 19) and the most common AE by PT in 
both treatment groups was COVID-19, with 4 (18.2%) in tezepelumab and 4 (19.0%) patients in 
placebo (Table 19).

3.  With respect to the 4 patients who discontinued treatment, please clarify the timing 
of these discontinuations and whether or not they occurred before or after the Week 
12 vaccination visit. 
Summary of MAH Response 
Of the 4 patients who discontinued treatment, all of them discontinued treatment before the Week 12 
vaccination visit. 
CHMP’s Comments 
The MAH has clarified that the 4 patients who discontinued treatment did so before the Week 12 
vaccination visit. 
Conclusion 
Issue Resolved 
4.  In relation to the results for the Influenza A H1N1 strain; the GMFR response for the 
HAI assay in the tezepelumab treatment arm was greater than in the placebo 
treatment arm. The MAH is asked to discuss whether this is a considered a chance 
finding or if there is a plausible scientific explanation for the result. 
Summary of MAH Response 
AstraZeneca acknowledges that, for the Influenza A H1N1 strain, the GMFR response for the HAI assay 
in the tezepelumab treatment group was greater than in the placebo treatment arm and considers the 
results to be a chance finding. 
Overall, VECTOR results, which included 28 outcome measures for four influenza strains, indicate that 
there was generally no difference in antibody response post vaccination. Antibody response to the 
Influenza H1N1 strain was assessed in parallel by two assays (HAI and MN). The number of patients 
included in the primary analysis for VECTOR was small (33 participants per treatment arm). No 
difference in response was observed for H1N1 MN GMFR. No difference between treatment arms was 
observed for the absolute GMT achieved post vaccination for anti-H1N1 antibodies regardless of assay 
used (HAI or MN) and regardless of respective antibody fold rise. 
Altogether, the data suggest that the observed greater GMFR response for the HAI assay in 
tezepelumab-treated patients was a chance finding. 
CHMP’s Comments 
It is agreed that the finding for the Influenza A H1N1 strain having a GMFR response for the HAI assay 
in the tezepelumab treatment group greater than in the placebo treatment arm is most likely to be a 
chance finding. 
Overall, the results have indicated that there is no difference in antibody response post vaccination 
between Tezepelumab or placebo groups across the assessed influenza strains.

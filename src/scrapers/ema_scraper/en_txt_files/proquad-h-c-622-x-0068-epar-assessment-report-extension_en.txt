Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested Extension 
The MAH submitted on 20 December 2012 to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) an application for 
an  extension  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  pursuant  to  Article  19  of  Commission  Regulation 
(EC) No 1234/2008.  
The MAH applied for the addition of a new route of administration, Intramuscular use, leading to an 
amendment of the existing marketing authorisation.  
The  clinical  data  supporting  the  addition  of  the  intramuscular  administration  (study  F05-MMRV-304) 
were  previously  submitted  in  the  context  of  FUM  025,  which  was  assessed  and  concluded in  August 
2010. The MAH proposed with the current application to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC. The Package Leaflet and Labelling were proposed to be updated in accordance.  
No  data  regarding  quality  have  been  included  in  the  submission  as  the  product  itself  would  not

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
ProQuad has been licensed in Europe since April 2006. ProQuad is indicated for simultaneous 
vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella in individuals from 12 months of age. 
ProQuad can be administered to individuals from 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g., to 
conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high 
prevalence of measles. 
The licensed route of administration for ProQuad is the subcutaneous (SC) route. In many Member 
States healthcare providers administer measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccines by the 
intramuscular (IM) route. A recent study has demonstrated that both IM and SC routes of 
administration of the MAH’s combined MMR (M-M-RVAXPRO) or varicella vaccine (Varivax), containing 
the same virus components, elicit similar immunogenic responses and display similar safety and 
tolerability profiles.  
The primary aim of study F05-MMRV-304 (EudraCT: 2006-001986-40) was to demonstrate that two 
doses of ProQuad administered by the IM route are as immunogenic as two doses of ProQuad 
administered by the SC route to healthy children 12 to 18 months of age. Additionally, the study was 
designed to investigate the antibody titres and immune response rates to measles, mumps, rubella 
and varicella four weeks after the first dose and the antibody titres six weeks after the second dose of 
ProQuad administered by the IM or the SC route and to investigate the safety profile after each of the 
two doses of ProQuad both administered either by the IM or the SC route to healthy children 12 to 18 
months of age. ProQuad was expected to provide similar immunogenicity against measles, mumps, 
rubella, and varicella by the IM route as the concomitant administration of M-M-R II and VARIVAX as 
previously demonstrated. For regulatory acceptance the MAH committed to confirm in an 
immunogenicity and safety trial that IM and SC administration of ProQuad are comparable (ref also to 
FUM 025). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

2.4.  Design and conduct of the clinical study 
Study F05-MMRV-304 was a Phase IIIb, open-label, randomised, two groups, comparative, multicentre 
study carried out in France. 
Study subjects and treatments 
During the study 380 healthy seronegative children of either gender aged between 12 and 18 months 
were planned to be enrolled in 40 centres in France and to be randomly assigned to one of the two 
study groups to receive ProQuad either by the IM or SC route.  The administration schedule of ProQuad 
was as recommended (i.e. two doses administered at least 1 month apart) in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC). 
The use of an anaesthetic cream or patch at the injection site was not allowed. The site of 
administration was the upper arm.. The second dose was administered in the contra-lateral arm. 
Three visits were foreseen: Inclusion Visit (Day 0 = first dose), Visit 2 (second dose) between Day 30 
and Day 44 after Visit 1, and Visit 3 between Day 42 and Day 56 after Visit 2.  
Three blood samples were collected from subjects participating in the study: 
• 
The first blood sample (BS1) was collected after the subject’s eligibility had been verified and 
the informed consent signed by both holders of the parental authority or by the legal 
representative. This had to be within seven days before or at the time of Visit 1, and before the 
first vaccination.

• 
• 
The  second  blood  sample  (BS2)  was  collected  between  Day  30  and  Day  44  post  dose  1  and 
prior to dose 2.  
The third blood sample (BS3) was collected between Day 42 and Day 56 post dose 2. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To demonstrate that two doses of ProQuad administered by the IM route are as immunogenic as two 
doses of ProQuad administered by the SC route to healthy children 12 to 18 months of age in terms of 
antibody response rates to measles, mumps and rubella measured by ELISA and to varicella measured 
by gpELISA at 42 days following the second dose of ProQuad. 
For  each  of  the  four  antigens  tested  (i.e.  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella),  the  primary 
hypothesis was that the IM route would be non-inferior to the SC route. 
Secondary objectives 
−  To  describe  the  antibody  response  rates  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella  30  days  after 
the first dose of ProQuad administered by the IM or SC route. 
−  To  describe  the  antibody  titres  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella  30  days  after  the  first 
dose of ProQuad and 42 days after the second dose of ProQuad, both administered by the IM or 
SC route. 
−  To  describe  the  safety  profile  of  each  of  the  two  doses  of  ProQuad,  both  administered  either  by 
the IM or SC route. 
Criteria for evaluation 
• 
Immunogenicity: 
Primary criterion: Antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella measured six 
weeks after the second dose of ProQuad in both groups (BS3). 
Secondary criteria: 
−  Antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella measured four weeks after the 
first dose of ProQuad in both groups (BS2). 
−  Antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella measured four weeks after the first dose 
of ProQuad (BS2) and six weeks after the second dose of ProQuad (BS3) in both groups. 
−  Rates of subjects with varicella antibody titres ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL in subjects whose baseline 
varicella antibody titre (BS1) was <1.25 gpELISA units/mL, four weeks after the first dose of 
ProQuad (BS2) and six weeks after the second dose of ProQuad (BS3) in both groups. 
•  Safety: 
From Day 0 to Day 4 following each dose: Solicited injection-site adverse reactions including injection-
site erythema, swelling and pain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/71891/2014 
Page 6/18 
 
  
  
From Day 0 to Day 28 following each dose: unsolicited injection-site adverse reactions and systemic 
adverse events: 
−  Unsolicited injection-site adverse reactions, including injection-site erythema, injection-site 
swelling and injection-site pain starting from Day 5 to Day 28. 
−  Rectal temperature (≥38.0°C or, if missing, axillary temperature ≥37.1°C and ≥39.4°C or, if 
missing, axillary temperature ≥38.5°C). 
−  Measles-like, rubella-like, varicella-like and zoster-like rash, mumps-like illness. 
−  Other systemic adverse events. 
From Day 0 to the last visit of the concerned subject: serious adverse events. 
Determination of Sample Size 
Table 2 Power of the study per valence and overall for the Per Protocol Analysis assuming 
190 subjects included per group 
The  overall  power  of  the  study  should  be  around  90%  for  the  success  of  the  primary  objective.  The 
enrolled  sample  size  would  therefore  be  190  subjects  in  each  group  for  a  total  sample  size  of  380 
subjects. 
The study design was found appropriate with satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
randomisation procedure.  
Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity 
Primary criteria: The main analysis evaluated the immunogenicity after the second dose of ProQuad 
based on the Per Protocol Sets Post-dose 2 stratified by region (i.e., pooled centres based on 
geographic location); the statistical analysis was based on two-sided 95% (adjusted for multiplicity) 
confidence interval (CI) around the difference in response rates [Group 1 (IM) – Group 2 (SC)] for 
each valence. The non-inferiority criterion was achieved if the lower bound of the 95% CI was >(-10) 
percentage points. 
The supportive analysis evaluated the immunogenicity based on the Per Protocol Sets Post-dose 2 not 
stratified by region and on the Full Analysis Set (stratified by region and not stratified). 
Secondary criteria: A descriptive analysis within each group was performed for measles, mumps, 
rubella and varicella including the calculation after each dose of the GMTs (and 95% CIs), the response 
rates (and 95% CIs) and the rates (and 95% CIs) of subjects with varicella antibody titres ≥1.25

gpELISA units/mL in subjects whose baseline varicella antibody titre was <1.25 gpELISA units/mL 
(seronegative antibody titre). 
Safety:  
The safety analysis of each dose of ProQuad was descriptive.  
Data sets analysed 
The Randomised Set was defined as all randomised subjects. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the 
study vaccine and with any post-vaccination immunogenicity evaluation. 
Two Per Protocol Sets were defined with one for the analysis of the immunogenicity criteria Post-dose 
1 (Per Protocol Set Post-dose 1 [PPS1]) and a second for the analysis of the immunogenicity criteria 
Post-dose 2 (Per Protocol Set Post-dose 2 [PPS2]). 
2.5.  Immunogenicity results  
During the recruitment period 411 healthy children aged 12 to 18 months were selected and thereof 
405 children were randomly allocated to one of the two vaccination groups (Table 1). All subjects 
attended Visit 1 and Visit 2, whereas one subject in the IM group and three in the SC group did not 
attend Visit 3. All subjects received both doses of the study vaccine. 
Table 3: Disposition of subjects 
The PPS1 of subjects initially seronegative to measles (titre <255 mIU/mL) consisted of 153 (75.7%) 
subjects in the IM group and 148 (72.9%) in the SC group, the PPS1 of subjects initially seronegative 
to mumps (titre <10 ELISA Ab units/mL) consisted of 152 (75.2%) subjects in the IM group and 149 
(73.4%) in the SC group; the PPS1 of subjects initially seronegative to rubella (titre <10 IU/mL) 
consisted of 129 (63.9%) subjects in the IM group and 133 (65.5%) in the SC group; the PPS1 of 
subjects initially seronegative to varicella (titre <1.25 gpELISA units/mL) consisted of 138 (68.3%) 
subjects in the IM group and 136 (67.0%) in the SC group.  
The PPS2 of subjects initially seronegative to measles (titre <255 mIU/mL) consisted of 153 (75.7%) 
subjects in the IM group and 147 (72.4%) in the SC group; the PPS2 of subjects initially seronegative 
to mumps (titre <10 ELISA Ab units/mL) consisted of 152 (75.2%) subjects in the IM group and 148 
(72.9%) in the SC group; the PPS2 of subjects initially seronegative to rubella (titre <10 IU/mL)

consisted of 129 (63.9%) subjects in the IM group and 132 (65.0%) in the SC group; the PPS2 of 
subjects initially seronegative to varicella (titre <1.25 gpELISA units/mL) consisted of 138 (68.3%) 
subjects in the IM group and 134 (66.0%) in the SC group. 
Demographic and other Baseline Characteristics  
As  shown  in  Table  2  for  the  Randomised  Set  the  mean  age  at  first  vaccination  was  13.68  (±1.48) 
months and the gender distribution was 50.9% male and 49.1% female.  
The  FAS,  PPS1,  PPS2,  Safety  Set  Post-dose  1  and  Safety  Set  Post-dose  1  were  comparable  to  the 
Randomised  Set.  The  two  groups  were  comparable  with  respect  to  the  mean  time  between  first 
vaccination to BS2 (36.1 ±6.3 days) and second vaccination to BS3 (46.2 ±5.5 days). 
Table 4: Demographic and other Baseline Characteristics – Randomised Set 
Between  Visit  1  and  Visit  3,  359  subjects  (88.6%)  reported  the  intake  of  at  least  one  concomitant 
medication,  a  rate  that  was  comparable  between  the  two  groups.  The  most  frequently  reported 
concomitant medication was in the category nervous system (75.7% in the IM group and 73.9% in the 
SC group), i.e. mainly analgesics, followed by respiratory system (61.9% in the IM group and 60.6% in 
the SC group), i.e. mainly nasal preparations and cough and cold preparations, and anti-infectives for 
systemic  use  (39.6%  in  the  IM  group  and  39.9%  in  the  SC  group),  i.e.  mainly  antibacterial  for 
systemic use.

Results 
Primary objective 
For both IM and SC groups, the antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella were 
>99% at six weeks after the second dose of ProQuad for the subjects initially seronegative to measles, 
mumps, rubella or varicella (see Table 5). 
Table 5: Summary and Non-inferiority Analysis (Stratified by Region) of Antibody Response 
Rates to Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella 6 Weeks after the Second Dose of ProQuad 
for Subjects Initially Seronegative to Measles, Mumps, Rubella or Varicella – Antigen 
Specific PPS 2  
The lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI on the difference in antibody response rates for all antigens 
was greater than -10%. Therefore, in all cases the difference was statistically significantly lower than 
the pre-defined clinically relevant non-inferiority margin of -10%. Non-inferiority of the response rates 
to all antigens following 2 doses of ProQuad administered IM vs. SC was therefore established.  
Consequently,  the  primary  objective  of  this  study  has  been  met  since  a  2-dose  regimen  of  ProQuad 
administered by the IM route is as immunogenic as a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered by the 
SC  route,  regarding  response  rates  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella  at  six  weeks  post-
vaccination. 
Although the PPS and the FAS were different in terms of number of patients analysed, response rates 
to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, as well as non-inferiority results obtained with and without 
stratification by geographic region, were also similar in both groups in the FAS.

Secondary objectives 
•  Antibody Response Rates after the First Dose of ProQuad 
Four  weeks  after  the  first  dose  of  ProQuad,  response  rates  for  measles,  rubella  and  varicella  were 
numerically  similar  in  both  groups.  The  response  rate  for  mumps  was  numerically  higher  in  the  IM 
group. The mumps and varicella antibody response rates were higher post-Dose 2 of ProQuad in both 
groups. Results were similar in the FAS.

•  Antibody Titres (GMT) after the First and Second Doses of ProQuad 
Measles, mumps, rubella and varicella GMTs were comparable in the two groups after the first and the 
second doses of ProQuad.

Measles GMTs were also comparable after the first and the second doses. Mumps, rubella and varicella 
GMTs  were  numerically  higher  after  the  second  dose  of  ProQuad  than  after  the  first  dose,  the  most 
robust boosting effect being observed for varicella. Results were similar in the FAS.

•  Rate of Subjects with Varicella Antibody Titre ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL after the First and 
Second Doses of ProQuad 
Following both the first and second doses of ProQuad, the rates of subjects with varicella antibody titre 
≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL were similar in both groups.

dose 1 and Post-dose 2 for Varicella 
2.5.1.  Conclusions on immunogenicity 
The results presented demonstrate no difference between the IM and the SC routes of administration 
in terms of immunogenicity parameters following a 2 dose regimen. The post-dose 2 response rates 
and GMTs were generally comparable for all vaccine components. Regarding mumps higher response 
rates were obtained post dose 1 following intramuscular administration (IM: 97.4% vs SC: 91.3%). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The Safety Set considered all subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and had 
safety follow-up data up to 30 to 44 days post dose 1 and up to 42 to 56 days post dose. 
Assessment report

Patient exposure 
All subjects received both vaccinations and had safety follow-up data after receiving the first dose of 
ProQuad (202 in the IM group and 203 in the SC group). 201 subjects in the IM group and 200 
subjects in the SC group had safety follow-up data after receiving the second dose of ProQuad. 
Consequently, there were two sub-sets for the safety analysis: Safety Set Post-dose 1 – after the first 
vaccination with ProQuad and Safety Set Post-dose 2 - after the second vaccination with ProQuad. 
Adverse events 
Following the first dose of ProQuad, injection-site adverse reactions from Day 0 to Day 28 were 
reported by fewer subjects in the IM group (17.8%) than in the SC group (28.6%). Most reactions 
started during the first four days after vaccination. The incidences were higher in the SC group than in 
the IM group for injection-site erythema (14.3% in the SC group vs. 5.0% in the IM group) and 
injection-site swelling (3.9% in the SC group vs 1.0% in the IM group). Conversely, injection-site pain 
was more frequent in the IM group than in the SC group (10.9% in the IM group vs. 5.9% in the SC 
group). No injection-site adverse reaction was described as being of severe intensity. There was no 
injection-site rash of interest in the IM group, whereas there were two reports in the SC group (1 
rubella-like rash and 1 varicella-like rash). 
Concerning systemic adverse events, the incidences were similar in the two groups (78.2% in the IM 
group and 82.3% in the SC group). 
In addition, the incidence of non-injection-site rashes of interest was similar in both groups (4.5% in 
the IM group and 5.4% in the SC group). There were more cases of measles/measles-like rash in the 
SC group than in the IM group: four and one, respectively. Conversely, there were two cases of 
varicella/varicella-like rash in the IM group and one in the SC group. One mumps/mumps-like illness 
was reported in the IM group (‘parotid gland enlargement’, severe intensity), and none in the SC 
group.  
Regarding body temperature ≥39.4°C (rectal equivalent) measured between Day 5 and Day 12, the 
incidence was 13.1% in the IM group and 11.1% in the SC group. 
A 13-month-old male subject without medical history of seizure, experienced moderate febrile seizure, 
31 days after receiving the first dose of ProQuad by the subcutaneous route. It was considered not to 
be vaccine related.

Following the second dose of ProQuad (Day 0 to Day 28), similarly to what has been observed after 
the first dose, there were fewer reports of injection-site adverse reactions in the IM group (20.4%) 
than in the SC group (29.5%). Most injection-site adverse reactions occurred during the first four days 
after injection and the imbalance in favour of the IM group was due to injection-site erythema (15.4% 
in the IM group vs. 27.0% in the SC group) and injection-site swelling (6.0% in the IM group vs. 
12.5% in the SC group). The incidence of injection-site pain was the same in both groups (10.0%). 
Only one subject reported an injection-site adverse reaction of severe intensity (pain, in the IM group).  
There was only one report of an injection-site rash of interest (measles in the SC group) and one 
report of a mumps/mumps-like illness, ‘parotid gland enlargement’, (IM group, moderate intensity, this 
subject reported the same event following the first dose). 
Concerning systemic adverse events, the incidences were comparable in the two groups (67.7% in the 
IM group and 61.0% in the SC group). 
There were twice as many reports of non-injection-site rashes of interest in the SC group (4.0%) 
compared with the IM group (2.0%). No measles/measles-like rash or varicella/varicella-like rash was 
reported in the IM group compared to six subjects in the SC group.  
Regarding body temperature ≥39.4°C (rectal equivalent) measured between Day 5 and Day 12, the 
incidence was 4.1% in the IM group and 7.3% in the SC group.

The second dose of ProQuad was generally better tolerated than the first in both groups. In the IM 
group, 52.0% of subjects reported an injection-site adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic 
adverse event after the first dose of ProQuad compared to 34.8% after the second dose of ProQuad, 
and 56.2% and 42.5%, respectively, in the SC group. The difference was mainly due to the systemic 
adverse event pyrexia. After the first dose, in the IM group 56.9% of subjects reported pyrexia 
(≥38.0°C rectal) compared to 44.3% after the second dose, and 61.6% and 41.0%, respectively, in 
the SC group (Day 0 to Day 28). Regarding vaccine-related pyrexia, the difference was more striking, 
with twice as many subjects reporting vaccine-related pyrexia after the first dose of ProQuad compared 
to the second dose in both the IM group and the SC group.

In addition, fewer subjects had a body temperature (rectal equivalent) ≥39.4°C between Day 5 and 
Day 12 after the second dose of ProQuad than after the first dose (IM group: 13.1% after the first 
dose vs. 4.1% after the second dose and SC group: 11.1% after the first dose vs. 7.3% after the 
second dose). 
Further evaluation of adverse events assessed as 'of interest' such as seizures, myalgia, arthralgia, 
malaise, dizziness or fatigue, or terms with similar medical meaning, shows that 3 subjects reported 
such events during this study:  
•  one case of non-serious asthenia of moderate intensity occurred 7 days after the first dose of 
ProQuad administered subcutaneously, which resolved spontaneously within 70 days, and was 
considered by the investigator to be possibly related to vaccination. Asthenia was associated with 
fever, starting also 7 days after vaccination and lasting for 4 days, with a maximum of 39.1°C.  
• 
• 
one subject reported non-serious weakness of mild intensity, 8 days after the second dose of 
ProQuad administered intra-muscularly, which resolved spontaneously within 3 days, and was 
considered by the investigator to be possibly related to vaccination. Weakness was associated with 
fever of 38.6°C starting 2 days after weakness, and lasting for less than 24 hours.  
one subject reported non-serious hip inflammation of mild intensity, 19 days after the second 
dose of ProQuad administered intra-muscularly, considered by investigator to be not-related to 
vaccination. Hip inflammation was associated with fever starting 3 days after hip inflammation, 
with a maximum of 39.2°C and lasting for 9 days.  
The majority of systemic adverse events reported from Day 0 to Day 28 were considered unrelated to 
vaccination by the investigator and were bronchiolitis (4% in the IM group and 1.5% in the SC group, 
all unrelated to vaccination); tracheitis (7.5% in the IM group and 3.0% in the SC group, all unrelated 
to vaccination); and cough (5.5% in the IM group and 3.5% in the SC group, 2 events in each group 
considered as vaccine-related). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were six serious adverse events reported after vaccination during the study. In each group (IM 
and SC), there were two serious adverse events reported after the first vaccination with ProQuad and 
one after the second vaccination. None of these events was considered by the investigator to be 
vaccine-related. No anaphylactic event or vaccine-related febrile seizure was reported during the 
study.  
In addition, one subject reported a serious adverse event between signature of the Informed Consent 
Form and the first vaccination. This subject was not randomised in the study.  
No subject died during the course of the study. 
Laboratory findings 
Not applicable. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subject was withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Administration of ProQuad by the intramuscular route demonstrated an acceptable safety profile post 
dose 1 and 2. The safety profile was comparable for both administration groups except for local 
reactions. Injection-site adverse reactions (injection-site erythema and injection site swelling) were 
experienced in fewer subjects in the IM group after each dose. While up to 4 days post dose 1 pain 
was reported more frequently in the IM group, the incidence of injection-site pain was the same in 
both administration groups post dose 2. 
The second dose of ProQuad was generally better tolerated than the first dose in both groups. No 
safety concern was identified. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile after the first and second administration of ProQuad indicates that both routes of 
administration are comparable.  
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The current Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 4.0 for ProQuad covers the addition of the 
intramuscular (IM) use as new route of administration submitted in the scope of this extension as 
referred to in Annex I of Regulation (EC) N°1234/2008. 
The current RMP for ProQuad was developed based on safety data from the completed clinical trial 
F05-MMRV-304 (MAH-sponsored) which was conducted in children 12 to 18 months to compare the 
immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad by either IM or SC injection. 
2.8.  Update of the product information 
As a consequence of this new route of administration, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Also Annex II has been amended according to the current QRD template. 
The amendments to the respective sections of the SmPC are as follows: 
Section 4.2 
Method of administration 
The vaccine is to be injected by the subcutaneous route in the deltoid region of the upper arm or in the 
higher anterolateral area of the thigh. 
The vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC). 
The preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid area 
in older children, adolescents, and adults. 
The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder.  
Section 4.4 
Thrombocytopenia 
This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. 
Assessment report  
EMA/71891/2014 
Page 16/18 
 
  
  
Section 4.8 
Children who received ProQuad intramuscularly 
The general safety profiles of the IM and SC administration routes were comparable; however, fewer 
subjects experienced injection-site adverse reactions in the IM group after each dose (see section 5.1 for 
study description). 
Section 5.1 
Children who received 2 doses of ProQuad intramuscularly or subcutaneously 
In a clinical trial, 405 children received 2 doses of ProQuad, either by the IM or SC route of 
administration. Two doses of ProQuad administered by the IM route of administration were as 
immunogenic as two doses administered by the SC route in terms of antibody response rates and antibody 
titres to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.  
However, to be in line with the SmPC guideline the MAH was requested to amend sections 2 and 3 of 
the Package leaflet to include a statement on the administration of the vaccine in subjects with 
thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorders. The following statements were included: 
Section 2 
If you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be given 
under the skin. 
Section 3 
If the person to be vaccinated has a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine should be 
given under the skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle. 
Additionally minor typographic amendments were made, and the MAH took advantage of the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives to include Croatia.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Healthcare providers routinely administer live attenuated measles, mumps, rubella and varicella 
vaccines by the intramuscular route. Administration of ProQuad by the intramuscular route elicits 
comparable response rates to all vaccine components as compared to SC administration. Regarding 
mumps higher response rates were observed post dose 1 following intramuscular administration. 
IM administration results in fewer subjects experiencing injection-site erythema and swelling. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No clinical study data on IM administration of ProQuad are available in adolescents and adults.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No specific unfavourable effects pertaining to the IM administration were identified. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No clinical study data on IM administration of ProQuad are available in adolescents and adults. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Since IM administration is current practice by many HCP the approval of the IM route will reduce off-
label use. Based on the data assessed, it is not to be expected that IM administration of ProQuad to 
adolescents and adults will result in a different immunogenicity and safety profile compared to SC 
administration. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP recommends by consensus the 
granting of an extension of the Marketing Authorisation for the addition of a new route of 
administration, Intramuscular use, for the above mentioned medicinal product. 
The Icelandic and the Norwegian CHMP members agree with the above-mentioned recommendation of 
the CHMP on the variation of the terms of the marketing authorisation.

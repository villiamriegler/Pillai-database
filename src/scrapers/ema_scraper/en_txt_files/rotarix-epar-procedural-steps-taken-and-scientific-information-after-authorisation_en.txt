are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

types circulating throughout Europe, but which is not a 
suitable tool for detection of breakthrough disease or rare 
strains. The results of this study do not modify the benefit-

SmPC and PL 
The CHMP requested the MAH in December 2013 to update 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
the SmPC with a harmonised wording for rotavirus vaccines 
based on new epidemiological data that became available 
on intussusception. These data strengthen the existing 
evidence base that suggests a small increased risk of 
intussusception shortly after vaccination with Rotarix and 
Rotateq. A statement regarding any difference in risk 
between the two vaccines cannot, however, be made. 
Given that the vaccine attributable risk of intussusception 
remains small, the CHMP recommended that the balance of 
benefits and risks rotavirus vaccines remains favourable 
and requested the MAH that the SmPC should be updated 
to reflect that  
• 
Rotavirus vaccines carry an increased risk of 
intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 
6 additional cases per 100,000 infants have been observed 
in the US and Australia against a background incidence of 
33 to 101 per 100,000 infants (less than one year of age) 
per year, respectively. There is limited evidence of a 
smaller increased risk following the second dose. It remains 
unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall 
incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of 
follow up. 
• 
As a precaution, healthcare professionals should 
follow-up on any symptoms indicative of intussusception 
(severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, 
abdominal bloating and/or high fever) since data from 
Page 19/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of 
intussusception, mostly within 7 days after rotavirus 
vaccination. Parents/guardians should be advised to 
promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare 
provider. 
The CHMP agreed that the wording proposed by the MAH 
submitted for this variation was in line with the CHMP 
request.

Based on a surveillance study carried out by the MAH in

Mexico, as well as additional post-marketing data including 
observed/expected calculations of spontaneously reported 
cases of intussusception and other surveillance data, which 
pointed towards a small increased risk of intussusception 
during the first week after the first dose of Rotarix, the 
Product information was updated as follows: 
No increased risk of intussusception was observed in 
clinical trials following administration of Rotarix when 
compared with placebo. Although no causal relationship has 
been established between vaccination with Rotarix and 
intussusception (see section 4.8). However, a small 
increased risk of intussusception in the 31-day period 
mostly within 7 days following the administration of the 
Page 28/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
first dose of Rotarix cannot be excluded based on data from 
post-marketing safety studies. Therefore, as a precaution, 
healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms 
indicative of intussusception (severe abdominal pain, 
persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating 
and/or high fever). Parents/guardians should be advised to 
promptly report such symptoms.

granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Rotarix remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
Final data from post-authorisation safety studies are still 
awaited. Given the remaining questions regarding the risk 
Page 29/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of intussusception (IS) following administration of Rotarix, 
the regulatory authorities should be kept updated of the 
results of the ongoing post-authorisation safety studies to 
further study IS, as well as analyses of spontaneously 
reported IS cases. The CHMP considers that more safety 
experience needs to be gained about IS and recommended 
that the MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based on the safety profile of Rotarix, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

include reactogenicity and safety data from a pooled 
analysis of clinical trials conducted with either the 
lyophilised or the liquid formulation of Rotarix and 
post marketing data from both formulations. In 
addition to these changes, the MAH took the 
opportunity to add a reference to the European

the vaccine registration in Europe or through post-
marketing surveillance (PMS). A review of in total 23 
completed clinical trials breaking down into 20 placebo-
controlled and 3 non-placebo-controlled studies found 
additional previously unlisted adverse event 
(haematochezia) and that several frequency statements for 
listed adverse events needed to be revised. In addition, the

intussusception reported in temporal association with 
Rotarix in post-marketing experience. Most cases were 
reported within seven days following the first dose, 
however a clear causal relationship could not be 
established. Nevertheless, as a precaution, healthcare 
professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative 
of intussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent

vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or high 
fever). Parents/guardians should be advised to promptly 
report such symptoms. Furthermore, a number of adverse 
events currently listed under section 4.8 of the SPC have 
been removed, as they are not considered to be plausibly 
causally related to Rotarix vaccination: upper respiratory 
tract infection, irritability, crying, sleep disorder, 
somnolence, hoarseness, rhinorrhoea, loss of appetite, 
vomiting, constipation, rash, muscle cramp, fever and 
fatigue. It could be demonstrated that there was no 
significant difference between the placebo and Rotarix 
groups concerning events which are considered related to 
rotavirus infection (fever, vomiting, irritability, loss of 
appetite). The PI was updated to reflect these findings.

The results suggested that 3 doses of Rotarix given 
concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines are as safe 
as 3 doses of placebo in HIV infected infants. 
The data obtained was considered sufficient to support the

2 doses of Rotarix in pre-term infants. To fulfil this 
commitment, study Rota-054 was conducted in 4 European 
countries to assess Rotarix safety when given to pre-term 
infants concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines.  
The efficacy and safety results from study Rota-054 
showed that two doses of Rotarix may be given 
concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines in pre-term 
born at 27 to 36 weeks of gestation.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
follow-up from a clinical study that evaluated the efficacy, 
immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two doses of 
Rotarix in healthy infants when co-administered with 
specific childhood vaccinations in the European setting. The 
immunogenicity of childhood vaccinations was also 
evaluated to explore any effect of co-administration with 
the HRV vaccine. 
The efficacy results showed that sufficient protection 
against gastroenteritis caused by the serotypes G1P 8 , 
G2P 4 , G3P 8 , G4P 8  and G9P 8  continues in the second 
year of life, although the data for some of the serotypes

indicate a certain waning immunity over time. No 
interference of Rotarix on immune response to antigens 
contained in coadministered childhood vaccines (Infanrix 
Hexa, Infanrix Polio Hib, Prevenar or Meningitec) could be 
observed in this study. The safety data for the second year 
was comparable with data from the first year in this study 
and did not raise any further concerns.

series is administered to very premature infants (born ≤ 28

preterm infants should not be withdrawn from the 
immunisation scheme because the benefit of vaccination

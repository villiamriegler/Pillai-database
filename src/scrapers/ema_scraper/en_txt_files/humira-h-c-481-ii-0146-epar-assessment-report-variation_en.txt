2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Humira contains the active substance adalimumab, a recombinant human immunoglobulin 1 
monoclonal antibody specific for human tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Adalimumab contains 
exclusively human sequences and is a 1,330 amino acid macromolecule with a molecular weight of 
approximately 148 kilodaltons. Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-α and blocks its interaction with 
the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF-α receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that 
are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for 
leukocyte migration. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine involved in normal inflammatory and 
immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF-α are thought to play an important role in autoimmune 
disorders and immune-mediated disorders.  
Humira was first approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) through the 
centralised procedure by Commission Decision in September 2003 for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Since then, Humira was approved in a number of other (adult and paediatric) 
autoimmune conditions including psoriasis (PS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Crohn’s disease (CD) and 
ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition to the EU/EEA, adalimumab is approved in the United States of 
America (USA), Japan and numerous other countries throughout the world. It has been studied in 
clinical trials that together include more than 9,000 patients. 
In this variation application, the MAH seeks an extension of the indication to the treatment of non-
infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult patients. The application is based on 3 clinical 
studies: two completed pivotal phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trialss (studies M10-877 in 
patients with active uveitis and M10-880 as maintenance treatment in patients controlled with 
corticosteroids), and an ongoing phase 3 open-label extension study (study M11-327). The MAH also 
provided the data of one non-clinical pharmacodynamic study. 
The proposed posology consist of an initial subcutaneous (SC) dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every 
other week (eow) starting one week after the initial dose. 
Background information on the disease  
Uveitis is a serious and debilitating disease concerning some or all ocular tissues comprising the uveal 
tract (iris, ciliary body, and choroid). It includes symptoms of severe intraocular inflammation, vision 
impairment and pain and patients are at risk of developing permanent visual impairment and 
blindness.   
According to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group (Jabs et al., 2005), 
uveitis can be classified according to the primary anatomical location of the inflammation into anterior 
uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis (affecting all 3 eye segments). The 
location of the inflammation dictates the prognosis and therapy for the disease. As an example, there 
is a higher risk of vision loss and blindness in subjects with posterior and pan-uveitis. Uveitis can also 
be categorised by the aetiology of the inflammatory process into infectious or non-infectious uveitis. 
Non-infectious uveitis can be further classified as to whether it is an isolated ocular syndrome (i.e., 
Birdshot choroidopathy) or if there is accompanying extra-ocular or systemic inflammation (i.e., 
sarcoidosis, Vogt Koyanagi Harada [VKH] disease, Behçet's disease, ankylosing spondylitis [AS], 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis [JIA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], etc). Subjects with non-infectious uveitis, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 7/108 
 
 
 
 
who have no characteristic disease pattern, or systemic involvement that indicates a specific diagnosis, 
are often referred to as having ‘idiopathic’ uveitis.  
Non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment usually has an early onset in life. The incidence 
of uveitis is greatest among people in the working age group of 20 to 50 years (Durrani et al., 2004), 
which adds to the socioeconomic burden of the disease. There is likelihood of progression to severe 
visual impairment if left untreated, with a substantial impact on day-to-day functioning and overall 
quality of life.  
The global annual incidence of uveitis (infectious and non-infectious) has been estimated at 17 to 52 
per 100,000 with a prevalence of 38 to 714 cases per 100,000 subjects. In Europe, up to 26% of total 
uveitis cases are intermediate, posterior or panuveitis (Wakefield and Chang, 2005). In the United 
States (US) and Western countries, it is estimated that approximately 10% to 20% of preventable 
blindness is caused by non-infectious uveitis and associated complications (Rothova et al., 1996; 
Miserocchi et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2011). 
Current treatment options  
At the time of this report, the established treatment for non-infectious uveitis was corticosteroids (CS, 
either topical, oral, periocular or intraocular). The type and severity of the disease dictate the route of 
administration of CS and the likelihood of requiring other immunosuppressive therapy to control the 
disease.  
Topical CS eye drops are often sufficient to control anterior uveitis, while for inflammation involving 
the posterior segment of the eye (intermediate, posterior or panuveitis), systemic or intraocular CS are 
required. Periocular CS injections can also be used in both anterior and posterior uveitis. 
Dexamethasone, 700 μg implants, and fluocinolone acetate, 190 μg implants, are approved in the EU 
for intravitreal use in the treatment of uveitis of the posterior eye segment. Both treatments have 
been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and improve visual acuity. However, their use is 
associated with ocular complications, mainly increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract, but 
also with rare sight-threatening events including endophthalmitis as a consequence of the intravitreal 
injection.  
Systemic CS are usually effective in the treatment of uveitis, although some patients, e.g., those with 
Behçet-associated uveitis, are known to be poor responders. Despite their benefit in the treatment of 
uveitis, the risk of adverse effects of long-term systemic CS therapy, including cataract development, 
osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and weight gain, limit their use in the treatment of non-infectious 
uveitis. The acceptability of CS-associated side effects differs between countries. However, for chronic 
suppression of uveitis, it is generally accepted in clinical practice that a CS sparing agent should be 
considered if > 10 mg per day of prednisone or its equivalent are required to achieve quiescence to 
avoid exposing patients to risk of adverse effects of CS.  
Immunosuppressive and –modulating agents are also used for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis 
in clinical practice. Ancillary studies indicate that immunosuppressants may be efficacious. However, 
efficacy and safety in this indication have not been established in well-controlled studies. The most 
commonly used immunosuppressive agents are azathioprine, methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF), ciclosporin and tacrolimus. At the time of this report, only ciclosporin was approved in 
the EU for uveitis treatment. However, its onset of action is rather slow and its use is associated with 
substantial side effects. In general, use of immunosuppressive agents has limitations related to safety. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 8/108 
 
 
 
 
Anti-TNF agents are also used in the treatment of various types of uveitis in clinical practice. However, 
with the exception of infliximab, which is approved in Japan for the treatment of refractory uveitis 
associated with Behçet's disease, no anti-TNF agent has been approved in this indication. 
Globally, there is a clear demand for additional effective and possibly steroid–sparing therapies in 
patients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology of adalimumab has been extensively studied and was described in previous 
applications. Non-clinical data available at the time of this report revealed no special hazard for 
humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. 
For the purpose of this application, a study in the Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis (EAU) 
mouse model mice (study R&D/09/1420) was conducted using a mouse anti-mouse TNF monoclonal 
antibody. This study had been recommended in a Scientific Advice by the CHMP for clinical dose 
selection purposes. No other non-clinical studies were conducted in support of this application.

Primary pharmacodynamic (PD) studies 
Study R&D/09/1420: A Role for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) in a Preclinical Model of Autoimmune 
Uveitis  
Method 
Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide (IRBP) 161-180 and Complete Freund’s adjuvant 
were used to immunise female mice. The day after immunisation the mice were treated with mouse 
anti-mouse TNF antibody A-846889.0 in 200 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a total of three 
doses (one per week). In the first part of the study all animals were administered a dose of 15 
mg/kg/week, however in the latter part animals were dosed ascending doses (0.15, 0.5, 1.5, 5 and 15 
mg/kg/week). The control group was injected with 200 μl IgG control. On Day 21 animals were 
euthanized and eyes prepared. Left and right eyes were scored separately for each animal. Severity of 
EAU was scored based on a system modified from Caspi et al. (1988). Total EAU histologic scores were 
based on photoreceptor damage (photoreceptor cell loss, retinal folds and detachment) and 
inflammatory infiltrates (vitreous, retina, retinal pigment epithelium and choroid). An additional scoring 
category was Dalen Fuchs-type nodules between the retina and the choroid which are characteristic 
features of chronic human uveitis. 
Results 
Group mean EAU scores are presented in Table 1.

2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Adalimumab is a human anti-human TNFα monoclonal antibody (IgG1), a composite of 100% human 
antibody sequences. In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), proteins are unlikely to result in a 
significant risk to the environment. Hence, the CHMP agreed that no environmental risk assessment 
(ERA) studies were needed. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has performed a PD study as previously recommended by the CHMP. The data show that 
murine anti-TNF is able to reduce inflammation in a murine IRBP-induced EAU model. A dose-
relationship in the decrease of photoreceptor damage was observed. However, a substantial reduction 
was only seen for the highest dose selected. The CHMP furthermore noted that an anti-TNF murine 
surrogate antibody (A-846889) was used in the tests. The MAH explained the use of A-846889 as the 
potency of TNF neutralization with adalimumab is about 3 orders of magnitude lower in mice compared 
to humans. No further explanation was available to clarify possible functional differences of the two 
antibodies, and to discuss the clinical relevance of adalimumab-mediated TNF-α blockade in the model. 
However, the CHMP was reassured by the lack of toxicity observed. All findings were consistent with 
the pharmacological mode of action of A-846889, which overlaps with that of adalimumab in humans. 
This supports the conclusion that there was no change to the pharmaco-toxicological profile of 
adalimumab. 
No other non-clinical studies were conducted, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The CHMP agreed that no ERA studies were needed as adalimumab is a protein. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that the non-clinical data provided by the MAH were adequate to support this 
application.

2.3.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity of adalimumab are well characterized in healthy 
subjects as well as in subjects in the approved indications (RA, CD, UC, PS, PsA, and AS). 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated in subjects with non-
infectious uveitis in the two pivotal phase 3 studies (studies M10-877 and M10-880, see section 2.4. 
for a detailed description of study design and methods). The population PK of adalimumab was 
evaluated in uveitis subjects using a non-linear mixed effects modeling approach in NONMEM. 
Furthermore, exposure-response analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum 
concentrations and efficacy of adalimumab in the phase 3 studies.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points:  
Adalimumab serum concentration: at Baseline and Weeks 1 (Study M10-877 only), 2 (Study M10-880 
only), 8, 12, 27, 36, and 52; furthermore at the final/early termination visit when the subject 
terminated prior to Week 52, an unscheduled visit before Week 52 if applicable. Baseline, Week 1, and 
Week 27 blood samples were also drawn prior to study drug (placebo and adalimumab) administration.

Anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) serum concentration: at Baseline, Weeks 12, 27, 36, and 52; and 
at the final/early termination visit when the subject terminated prior to Week 52, an unscheduled visit 
before Week 52 if applicable. Baseline and Week 27 samples were also drawn prior to study drug 
(placebo and adalimumab) administration. 
Methods 
•  Analytical methods 
Adalimumab concentrations in serum were determined using a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Serum samples were analysed for screening and confirmatory 
AAA assay using a validated double antigen immunoassay which detects antibodies directed against 
epitopes on the entire adalimumab molecule.  
•  PK data analysis 
Descriptive statistics of adalimumab concentrations are presented for within and between study 
comparisons. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis has been performed.  
PPK and exposure-response models were built using nonlinear mixed effect modeling implemented in 
NONMEM 7.3. The PK model was fit to the data using the first-order conditional estimation method 
with interaction and the exposure-response models using the Laplacian Conditional Estimation method 
within NONMEM.  
The models describing the relationships between adalimumab dose, exposure and response were built 
in a sequential manner. First, a PPK model was constructed to describe the relationships among 
adalimumab dose, serum concentration time profiles and covariates. Next, individual post hoc PK 
parameters generated from the final PPK model were used to predict adalimumab concentration-time 
profiles, which were applied as input functions of the PD models to describe the relationship between 
adalimumab exposure and its effects on efficacy (primary efficacy end point, i.e. time to treatment 
failure).  
2.3.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics

A summary of the serum adalimumab concentrations from all subjects in studies M10-877 and M10-
880, who received adalimumab treatment is presented in Table 2.

with Uveitis (Studies M10-877 and M10-880) 
The mean (SD) serum adalimumab concentration in the adalimumab treatment group in studies M10-
877 and M10-880 is shown in Figure 1.  
Figure 1 - Mean (+SD) Serum Adalimumab Concentrations Versus Time in Subjects 
with Uveitis (Studies M10-877 and M10-880) 
In the phase 3 studies M10-877 and M10-880, following adalimumab 80 mg at Baseline and 40 mg 
eow starting at Week 1, the mean serum adalimumab concentrations reached steady state levels 
(8-10 μg/mL) after the initial dose and remained constant through Week 52 during adalimumab 40 mg 
eow treatment. Adalimumab exposure was comparable between studies M10-877 and M10-880. 
•  Anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) formation 
In the phase 3 studies M10-877 and M10-880, the percentage of subjects who received adalimumab 
40 mg eow and tested positive for AAA was 4.8% (12/249) as shown in Table 3.

Table 3 - AAA Positive Rates (Studies M10-877 and M10-880) 
Overall, mean adalimumab concentrations were lower in AAA+ subjects compared to those in AAA– 
subjects, starting at Week 8 and remained lower throughout the study (see Figure 2).

Population PK analysis 
The PPK analysis was performed for subjects with at least one measurable adalimumab concentration 
in studies M10-877 and M10-880. A total of 248 uveitis subjects were included. Adalimumab 
concentration values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) during treatment were set to 
LLOQ/2. This approach was considered acceptable by the CHMP as the number of observations below 
limit of quantification was small with 54/1078 (5%).  
The demographic data for the subjects included in the PPK analyses are presented below.

Table 4 - Summary of patient characteristics 
Residual unexplained variability was explored using an additive, proportional or combined residual 
error model. Between-subject variability was described assuming a log-normal distribution.  
Model evaluation and selection was based on the objective function value (OFV, P < 0.01), goodness of 
fit plots and precision of the parameter estimates. The predictive performance was assessed by visual 
predictive checks (VPC). Confidence intervals (95% CI) around the parameter estimates were obtained 
from a nonparametric bootstrap (n=1000). 
Covariate evaluation was performed by a forward inclusion (P <0.01) backward elimination (P <0.001) 
procedure. Continuous covariates were included in the model using a power function centred around 
the median value and for categorical covariates, different parameter values were estimate for each 
category. The covariates that were evaluated were demographics such as age, weight, sex race etc. In 
addition, presence of AAA and some Baseline disease characteristics was evaluated on the apparent 
clearance (CL/F). 
The final PPK model included a one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination and 
inter-individual variability on CL/F and apparent volume of distribution of central compartment (V2/F), 
and a combined residual error model. The provided goodness of fit plots indicate some model 
misspecifications both at higher and lower exposures. The M3 method was tested but did not 
significantly improve the VPCs at the lower exposures. A two-compartment model, additional 
Michaelis-Menten elimination pathway, and alternative ETA structure did not resolve the issue either.  
The mean CL/F and V2/F of adalimumab were estimated to be 16.0 mL/hr (0.384 L/day) and 7.95 L, 
respectively, in subjects with non-infectious uveitis. The η-shrinkage for CL/F was 13% and for V/F 
58%. The shrinkage in V/F was high. However, no relevant differences in the estimated drug effect 
parameter values were found when removing eta on V/F, suggesting that the η-shrinkage did not have 
a significant impact on the outcome of the exposure-response analyses. 
Impact of covariates 
AAA, MTX and MMF use, and Baseline body weight were identified as significant covariates for CL/F of 
adalimumab. Adalimumab CL/F was approximately 3 times higher in the AAA+ subjects when 
compared to the AAA– subjects whereas concomitant MTX or MMF use were associated with reduced 
adalimumab CL/F by 38.4%. The increased clearance in AAA+ subjects in the PPK model was

Page 15/108 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with the lower adalimumab concentrations observed in studies M10-877 and M10-880 in 
this group of patients (see Figure 2) compared to AAA- subjects. 
There was a ~58% increase in median adalimumab CL/F in subjects with the highest weight quartile of 
87-174 kg compared to subjects with the lowest weight quartile of 38-65 kg. Baseline body weight was 
also identified as a significant covariate for V2/F. A stratification per body weight was requested by the 
CHMP to obtain reassurance of comparable exposure across the different patients weight-ranges. From 
the estimates provided by the MAH by weight range (66-86 kg, 38-65kg, and 87-174 kg), a difference 
of almost ±20% change in CL/F and V/F can be observed in the lowest and highest weight quartiles 
when compared to patients in the weight range of 66-86 kg. These results supported that patients in 
the weight range 66-86 kg were not underexposed. 
Comparison of PK across indications  
Subjects in the phase 3 studies with uveitis received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and the same 
initial dose was tested in subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis (study M02-528). Furthermore, mean 
steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations following 40 mg eow treatment in subjects with uveitis 
were compared to those observed in subjects with CD (study M02-433), UC (study M06-827), RA 
(study DE019), and PS (studies M02-528 and M03-656) using the same maintenance regimen (see 
Figure 3).  
Based on the mean steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations, similar exposure was observed in 
uveitis patients compared to other patient population using the same dose.

Concentrations in Subjects with Uveitis and Subjects with CD, UC, RA and Ps during

Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of adalimumab in non-infectious uveitis is the same as for other immune 
mediated disorders, i.e. blockage of TNF-α. Elevated levels of TNF-α are thought to play an important 
role in pathologic autoimmune disorders and immune-mediated disorders. Reports in the scientific 
literature suggest that non-infectious uveitis is mediated by T helper type 1 CD4+ T cells. TNF-α, a 
pro-inflammatory cytokine produced mainly by macrophages and T cells, has also been shown to play 
a role in the perpetuation of inflammation in uveitis by facilitating further leukocyte infiltration via 
adhesion molecule upregulation, macrophage activation, and dendritic cell maturation/survival (Dick et 
al., 2004). This has been supported by both laboratory and clinical studies showing elevated levels of 
TNF-α in peripheral CD4+ T cells of patients in both idiopathic and sarcoid intermediate uveitis and 
intraocularly in EAU rats (Okada et al., 1998, Murphy et al., 2004).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
There are numerous publications on the clinical use of anti-TNF agents in the treatment of various 
types of uveitis. Several of these publications report on the effectiveness of adalimumab (Callejas-
Rubio et al., 2008; Mushtaq et al., 2007; Diaz-Llopis et al., 2008) and also the TNF-alpha blocker 
infliximab. There have been also reports on the efficacy of adalimumab in paediatric patients with JIA-
associated or idiopathic uveitis (Vazquez-Cobian et al. 2006; Biester et al. 2007).  
In both phase 3 studies conducted with adalimumab in patients with non-infectious uveitis, the 
exposure-response relationship was explored for subjects in the adalimumab treatment arm using the 
primary endpoint, time to treatment failure. As shown in Figure 4, mean adalimumab concentrations 
were slightly higher in patients who did not experience treatment failure (9-11 μg/mL) compared to 
those with treatment failure (6–9 μg/mL), starting from Week 8 (see also PK/PD model in section 
2.3.2.3. ). 
Figure 4 - Mean (SD) Serum Adalimumab Concentrations versus Time by Occurrence of 
Treatment Failure (Studies M10-877 and M10-880) 
2.3.2.3.  PK/PD Model 
Graphical analyses and parametric time-to-event analyses were performed for a preliminary 
assessment of the exposure-response relationship for the efficacy of adalimumab in subjects with non-
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016

infectious uveitis using the primary efficacy end point, time to treatment failure assessed at or after 
Week 6 (study M10-877) or Week 2 (study M10-880). The observed time to treatment failure in 
studies M10-877 and M10-880 was furthermore plotted versus time stratified by placebo and different 
simulated adalimumab concentration quartile groups (at week 24). 
The PK-PD modeling was performed separately for each study because of the differences in the 
population between the two studies (adult subjects with active non-infectious uveitis in study M10-877 
versus adult subjects with inactive, non-infectious uveitis controlled with corticosteroids (CS) in study 
M10-880). A model was developed first to describe the observed time-to-treatment-failure in the 
placebo arm. Next, parameters of the placebo model were fixed and a concentration-effect model was 
developed for adalimumab concentration as a predictor of treatment failure. At last, a covariate 
evaluation for the drug effect parameter was performed. 
The concentration time profile of adalimumab was described by individual post-hoc PK parameters 
generated from the final population PK model.   
Model development was guided by the NONMEM objective function value (OFV). Predictive 
performance was evaluated by VPC where simulated predictions were compared in Kaplan-Meier plots 
with the observed data superimposed with the 95% prediction interval.  
The following covariates were investigated as significant covariates for Baseline hazard in placebo 
patients and for the drug effect parameter: age, sex, race, Japanese origin, bodyweight, co-
medications (prednisolone, azathioprine, MTX, ciclosporin and MMF) and baseline disease 
characteristics.  
Several baseline hazard distribution functions were tested and a constant baseline hazard function 
resulted in an adequate description of the observed time to treatment failure for the placebo arms in 
both studies and was hence used in the model. 
In study M10-877, visual acuity at baseline [best corrected visual acuity (logMAR BCVA) of left/right 
eye categorized as < 0.3 and ≥ 0.3] was identified as a significant covariate on the basal hazard rate 
for placebo. Subjects with logMAR BCVA ≥ 0.3 resulted in a higher probability of an event of treatment 
failure. None of the evaluated covariates on the drug effect parameter were significant.  
In study M10-880, number of flares in the past 12 months, type of uveitis, and Japanese population 
were identified as significant covariates on the basal hazard rate for placebo. Higher number of flares 
in the past 12 months resulted in a more likely event of treatment failure. The subjects with posterior 
uveitis had a lower probability of having treatment failure when compared to intermediate uveitis or 
panuveitis, whereas Japanese subjects had a higher probability of having treatment failure compared 
to the non-Japanese subjects within the placebo population. None of the evaluated covariates on the 
drug effect parameter were significant.  
The results from the exposure-response analyses showed that adalimumab treatment resulted in 
reduced risk of treatment failure when compared to the placebo group in both studies. Higher 
adalimumab concentrations were associated with lower probability of treatment failure. The estimated 
IC50 values for the inhibition of event of treatment failure were 9.7 μg/mL (95% CI 5.5-17.4 μg/mL) 
and 6.4 μg/mL (95% CI 3.8-10.8 μg/mL) in studies M10-877 and M10 880, respectively. No significant 
covariates were identified for IC50 of adalimumab. The model predicted IC50 values are based on the 
assumption that the maximum inhibitory effect is 100%. The assumption was evaluated by estimating 
the IC50 value when fixing the maximum inhibitory effect to different values. The assumed maximum 
effect has a significant influence on the IC50 estimate in the model and the assumption of 100% 
inhibitory effect provides the highest IC50 estimate. An additional sensitivity analysis (i.e. objective 
function values) and VPC showed only minor differences in the model fits.

Furthermore, in response to a request by the CHMP to evaluate alternative dosing regimens, clinical 
trial simulations were performed by the MAH. The final PK/PD model was used for a more frequent 
dosing regimen for adalimumab, i.e., 80 mg loading dose at baseline followed by 40 mg every week 
starting at Week 1 under 3 different assumptions of the maximum inhibitory effect (Imax = 0.6, 0.8, 
and 1). The results of these simulations indicated a potentially higher benefit of adalimumab 40 mg 
every week. Given the assumption of Imax=1, there is an increased benefit with a 40 mg every week. 
The PK/PD model suggests a decreased treatment failure of approximately 15%.  
2.3.2.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK properties of adalimumab have been previously characterised in healthy subjects as well in the 
approved indications. PK, immunogenicity and exposure-response relationship of adalimumab in 
patients with non-infectious uveitis were evaluated in the two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials (studies 
M10-877 and M10-880). In addition, PPK and PK-PD modelling was performed.  
No specific PD data have been submitted to support this application. However, non-clinical data 
support a role of TNF-α in uveitis and there are some smaller clinical trials/case series that indicate an 
effect of anti-TNF agents in this disease. No further data was considered necessary by the CHMP. 
In the phase 3 studies, a range of steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations from 8-10 μg/mL 
was achieved. This exposure range was similar to what has been observed in other patients groups 
(CD, UC, RA, and PS) studied with the same initial and maintenance dose (studies M02-528 and M03-
656).  
The final PPK model included a one-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination. 
This approach was similar to previous applications for Humira. However, the CHMP remarked that in 
light of the limited data in uveitis patients, use of exposure data of adalimumab in other indications 
would have helped to strengthen the model.  
In the PK and PPK analyses, AAA, MTX and MMF use, and Baseline body weight were identified as 
significant covariates of adalimumab clearance. Particularly AAA+ had a significant impact on 
adalimumab exposure, whereby patients with a positive AAA status had lower adalimumab serum 
concentrations compared to AAA– subjects. The effect of AAA was already reflected in the SmPC of 
Humira. Further discussion on the development of AAA in patients with and without concomitant IMM 
use is provided in section 2.4.4. Likewise, the impact of body weight is further discussed in section 
2.4.4. based on subgroup analyses by weight categories. 
The estimated IC50 values for the inhibition of event of treatment failure were 9.7 μg/mL (95% CI 5.5-
17.4 μg/mL) and 6.4 μg/mL (95% CI 3.8-10.8 μg/mL) in studies M10-877 and M10 880, respectively, 
indicating that steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations at 8-10 μg/mL were on the lower side 
of the therapeutic dose range. The exposure-response analyses further indicated that patients with 
treatment failure had lower adalimumab exposure compared to those without treatment failure in both 
studies. This suggests that the doses used were too low or that the dosing frequency should be 
increased. As no dose-response studies have been performed the rationale for the chosen dosing 
regimen was not clear. In fact, clinical trial simulations indicated that there may be a potential benefit 
of a maintenance dose of 40 mg every week. For this regimen, an additional 15% reduction in 
treatment failures was estimated by the model compared to the 40 mg eow regimen. The CHMP 
recommended that the weekly dosing regimen should be further explored in the clinical setting post-
approval. 
Finally, the CHMP noted that the population PK model over predicted low exposures. However it was 
expected that this issue will have no considerable impact on the efficacy and safety of the adalimumab

EMA/501143/2016  
Page 19/108 
 
 
 
 
treatment of non-infectious uveitis and for this reason, the CHMP decided not to further pursue the 
issue in the present application. Nevertheless, it is expected that this feature of the population PK 
model is improved for future use of the model.   
2.3.2.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the clinical pharmacology data provided with this application were 
adequate to support this application. The population PK model was found to over predict low exposures 
and the MAH is expected to improve this feature if the model is used in future applications. 
Furthermore, the CHMP recommended that post-approval, a weekly dosing regimen of 40 mg 
adalimumab is further explored in the clinical setting. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No clinical dose response studies were performed in support of this application. The adalimumab dose 
regimen in the pivotal phase 3 placebo-controlled studies consisted of an 80 mg SC loading dose, 
followed by 40 mg eow starting at Week 1. The purpose of the initial loading dose of 80 mg was to 
achieve steady-state adalimumab concentrations and efficacy earlier during treatment. This dose was 
previously studied in psoriasis and has been shown to be an appropriate loading dose for the 40 mg 
eow maintenance regimen. 
Exposure-response analyses including a PK-PD model are summarised in section 2.3.2.  
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
The results of two pivotal phase 3 studies investigating the use of Humira in active uveitis (M10-877) 
and in corticosteroid depended patients with ‘inactive’ uveitis (M10-880) were provided. Both studies 
consisted of a main study and a sub-study in Japanese subjects. Efficacy outcomes from the Japanese 
sub-studies are summarised among the ancillary analyses (section 2.4.2.3. ) and as part of the 
integrated analyses of the primary endpoint.

Treatments 
Study drug: Humira was administered in pre-filled syringes containing adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 mL or 
matching placebo. Drug was administered SC as an 80 mg or placebo loading dose (2 syringes) at 
baseline followed by a 40 mg or placebo dose eow starting at Week 1. Treatment was administered by 
medical staff or self-administered (after training), the latter was recorded in a dosing diary.  
Open label prednisone (from commercially available sources): All subjects were to receive a 
prednisone burst of 60 mg/day at randomisation. Beginning at Week 2, subjects were to undergo a 
standardised taper schedule (10 mg/week between Weeks 2 and 5, thereafter reductions in smaller 
steps) until all subjects were off oral prednisone by Week 15, see Table 5.

Beginning at Week 1, subjects who entered the study on topical CS were to undergo a standardised 
taper schedule until all subjects were off topical CS by Week 9. 
Objectives 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab (80 mg loading dose at Baseline followed by a 40 
mg dose given eow SC starting at Week 1) compared with placebo in subjects requiring high-dose 
systemic CS for treatment of active non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to treatment failure on or after Week 6. Both of the 
subject's eyes were to be evaluated for the purpose of assessing treatment failure with no designated 
study eye and the first evaluation was conducted at Week 6. Criteria for treatment failure are 
summarised in the below table.

Table 6 - Study M10-877 Treatment Failure Criteria 
The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam was to be recorded (by the 
investigator) for each eye. VH scores were graded by the Investigator with the help of standardised 
photographs and descriptions. Independent sequential masked efficacy evaluations by a central reader 
were established for fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements. 
Secondary efficacy variables (ranked): 
1.  Change in AC cell grade in each eye from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to the final/early 
termination visit. 
2.  Change in VH grade according to NEI/SUN criteria in each eye from best state achieved prior to 
Week 6 to the final/early termination visit. 
3.  Change in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) BCVA in each eye from best state 
achieved prior to Week 6 to the final/early termination visit. 
4.  Time to OCT evidence of macular oedema in at least 1 eye on or after Week 6. 
5.  Percent change in central retinal thickness in each eye from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to 
the final/early termination visit. 
6.  Change in NEI Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25) composite score from best state 
achieved prior to Week 6 to the final/early termination visit. 
7.  Change in VFQ-25 sub-score distance vision from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to the 
Final/Early Termination Visit 
8.  Change in VFQ-25 sub-score near vision from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early 
Termination Visit 
9.  Change in VFQ-25 sub-score ocular pain from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early 
Termination Visit 
Other efficacy variables included analyses of mean changes (as well as area under the curve [AUCs]) 
of AC cell scores, VH scores, BCVA over time, time to failures for the individual components of the 
primary endpoint (post hoc for BCVA) and proportions of patients in quiescence/in steroid-free

quiescence. A number of patient reported outcomes (PROs) including VFQ-25 subscores, Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment, Questionnaire: 
Specific Health Problem Questionnaire (WPAI-SHP), and EuroQol-5D (EQ0-5D) Questionnaire were 
evaluated. 
Post hoc analyses were conducted using a definition for macular oedema with different centre point 
thickness cut-offs for different brands of OCT machines, for time to treatment failure and failure rates 
based on BCVA only and for the percentage of subjects in disease control at Week 1 and 4 were 
analysed (definition according to Table 6).  
Subgroup analyses based on e.g. duration and type of uveitis (location, aetiology), number of flares 
were conducted for the primary and ranked efficacy variables.  
Safety was assessed by collection and monitoring of adverse events (AEs), physical examination 
assessments, vital signs assessments, and laboratory data.  
Regarding blood samples for serum concentrations of adalimumab (PK and PK/PD analyses), see 
section 2.3.2.  
Sample size 
The placebo treatment failure rate at 6 months was assumed to be 70% and the adalimumab 
treatment failure rate at 6 months was assumed as 50%. For conservative purposes, it was assumed 
that failures would begin to occur after 2 months of study duration as the prednisone taper reached 
lower doses. In addition, a pooled dropout rate of 35% over 12 months was assumed. 
Using these failure rate assumptions for a log-rank test and a 2-sided significance level of 5%, a total 
of 138 events were needed. The assumptions also included power of 90% and an average accrual rate 
of 4 subjects per month in the first 30 months and 7 subjects per month thereafter. To achieve 
138 treatment failure events, it was anticipated that a sample size of approximately 234 subjects was 
needed. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who were eligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and had had all pre-randomization 
procedures performed were randomized in 1:1 double-masked fashion to the treatment groups using 
baseline IMM usage as the stratification factor. Randomization was not stratified by site due to the 
small expected number of subjects per site. Randomization was done using a block size of 4.  
Japan sub-study: Due to the small sample size, no stratification by baseline IMM usage was to be used 
for subjects from Japan. Subjects from Japan were to be randomized in a separate stratum. 
Blinding (masking) 
Double-masked study drug was provided as a sterile, preservative-free solution for injection contained 
in 1 mL pre-filled syringes containing adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 mL or matching placebo. All MAH 
personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the study (with the exception of the 
Drug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the study subjects were 
to remain masked to treatment throughout the masked period of the study. Interactive Web and Voice 
Response Systems were used to provide access to masked subject treatment information in the case of 
a medical emergency.

Statistical methods 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) set included all subjects who were randomized, excluding those for whom 
efficacy source data was incomplete and/or there were general GCP compliance issues at the sites. No 
per protocol analysis was planned.  
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) set includes all randomized subjects recruited outside Japan and 
was used for sensitivity analyses. 
The safety set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
The statistical test for the primary endpoint and ranked secondary endpoints as well as all other 
statistical tests were performed at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Descriptive statistics, including 
the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, 
and maximum for continuous variables; and counts and percentages for discrete variables, were 
provided. The analyses were performed using SAS® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
The 2-sided testing of ranked secondary endpoints were initiated only in case of statistically significant 
differences between the treatment groups for the primary endpoint. The statistical test for the ranked 
secondary variables was carried out in the hierarchical order shown. This means that statistically 
significant results for the higher ranked secondary variable were mandatory to initiate the testing of 
the next variable with a lower rank, thus controlling the multiple significance level of 5% two-sided. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics as well as efficacy variables were summarized for each 
treatment group using descriptive statistics. Statistical tests were performed to assess the 
comparability of the treatment groups assigned by randomization. Continuous variables were analysed 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and discrete variables were analysed using Chi-square test. For the 
primary endpoint and the 4th ranked secondary endpoint, Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated and 
Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted. The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using a log-rank test. 
Treatment failures on or after Week 6 were counted as events. Dropouts due to reasons other than 
treatment failure at any time during the study were considered as censored observations at the time of 
dropping out. 
In a sensitivity analysis, time to treatment failure was compared between the treatment groups in a 
proportional hazards model with treatment and baseline IMM usage as factors.  
The ranked secondary endpoints were analysed as follows: Change in AC cell grade, change in VH 
grade, change in logMAR BCVA, and change in central retinal thickness were compared between 
treatment groups using ANOVA adjusted for clustered observations (i.e., observations from each of the 
subject's eyes). Change in VFQ-25 was compared between treatment groups using ANOVA. Subjects 
dropping out through Week 6 were excluded from the analysis of AC cells, VH, logMAR BCVA, central 
retinal thickness, and VFQ-25. Missing values were imputed by last observation carried forward 
(LOCF), the subject's value at the time of treatment failure, or as carrying forward the last observed 
value if a subject did not fail until completion of the study. Baseline values were not used to impute 
the missing post-baseline values and missing values after Rx Day 1 were imputed using the latest non-
missing value after Rx Day 1 and prior to the missing value. 
The time to OCT evidence of macular oedema on or after Week 6 was analysed in a proportional 
hazards model. OCT evidence of macular oedema on or after Week 6 was counted as an event. 
Dropouts due to reasons other than OCT evidence of macular oedema were considered as censored 
observations at the time of dropping out.

Title: A Multicenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety of the Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal 
Antibody Adalimumab in Subjects with Inactive Non-infectious Intermediate Uveitis, 
Posterior Uveitis, or Panuveitis – Including a Sub-study in Japanese 
The study was a randomised (1:1), double-masked, placebo-controlled multicentre study in subjects 
with ‘inactive’ non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis while on oral prednisone 10 - 35 
mg/day (or oral CS equivalent). Baseline IMM was used as the stratification factor. Also this study 
included a sub-study in Japanese patients randomised in a separate stratum. Subjects needed to be on 
10 - 35 mg/day (or oral CS equivalent) at Baseline. 
The study was of 80 weeks duration or ended when approximately 96 treatment failures (excluding 
Japanese subjects) had occurred. Visits were scheduled at Baseline, then eow up to Week 8 and 
thereafter every 4 weeks.  
Figure 6 - Study Design Schematic for Study M10-880 
* The study ended when the 96 (84 to 107) event of treatment failure (excluding Japan subjects) had occurred. 
† May have been on 1 immunosuppressive therapy and/or topical steroids at pre-defined stable doses. 
a Prednisone taper was to occur from Week 2 up to Week 19. Topical steroids were allowed at study entry, but subjects were to 
undergo a mandatory taper schedule from Week 1 to Week 9. 
Study participants 
The main selection criteria were as for study M10-877 except for: 
Inclusion criteria 
•  Subject had inactive intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or pan-uveitis for ≥ 28 days prior 
to the Baseline visit, was taking ≥ 10 mg of oral prednisone to maintain this inactive state, and 
fulfilled 3 of the following criteria (investigator's clinical judgment at screening and baseline 
visits) for both eyes: 
o  Without active, inflammatory, chorioretinal, and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesion 
o  ≤ 0.5+ AC cells (SUN criteria) 
o  ≤ 0.5+ VH; (NEI/SUN criteria) 
•  On oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 35 mg/day (or oral CS equivalent) at Baseline and the 
dose had not been increased in the past 28 days or decreased in the past 14 days. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 27/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Documented history of ≥ 1 disease flare within 18 months of the Screening visit. This flare had 
to occur during or up to a maximum of 28 days after tapering off the oral CS therapy. 
Exclusion criteria 
• 
Intraocular or periocular CS within 90 days prior to the Baseline visit. 
•  Cystoid macular oedema unless the retinal changes were persistent (> 3 months duration), 
residual, and stable as defined by SUN criteria. 
Treatments 
Adalimumab and placebo treatment was administered as in study M10-877, i.e. a loading dose of 80 
mg or placebo, and thereafter 40 mg or placebo eow.  
Beginning at Week 2, subjects were to undergo a standardised taper schedule (5 mg/week between 
weeks 2 and 5, thereafter reductions in smaller steps) until all subjects were off oral prednisone no 
later than Week 19.

Safety was assessed by collection and monitoring of AEs, physical examination assessments, vital 
signs assessments, and laboratory data.  
Regarding blood samples for serum concentrations of adalimumab (PK and PK/PD analyses), see 
section 2.3.2.  
Sample size 
An overall treatment failure rate of 30 - 35% at 6 months was assumed, with an expected treatment 
effect corresponding to an absolute difference of 15% between the adalimumab and placebo group. 
For conservative purposes, it was assumed that failures would begin to occur after 2 months of study 
duration as the prednisone taper reached lower doses. In addition, a pooled dropout rate of 35% over 
12 months was assumed. Using these failure rate assumptions for a log-rank test and a 2-sided 
significance level of 5%, a total of 84 to 107 events (mean of 96) were needed. The assumptions also 
included power of 80% and an average accrual rate of 3 subjects per month in the first 28 months and 
16 subjects per month thereafter. To achieve 96 treatment failure events, it was anticipated that a 
sample size of approximately 220 subjects was needed.

GCP compliance issues at the sites 
b)  Subjects who had to terminate the study because the planned number of treatment failures was reached. 
c)  Subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug (placebo/adalimumab) were counted under each reason 
given for discontinuation; therefore, the sum of the counts given for the reasons may be greater than the 
overall number of discontinuations. 
Recruitment 
Study M10-877 was conducted between August 10th, 2010 (first subject visit) and August 29th, 2014 
(last subject, last visit). A total of 223 subjects with active non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior 
uveitis, or pan-uveitis were randomised and enrolled at 67 study sites located in Australia, Europe, 
Israel, Latin America, North America and Japan (sub-study).  
Study M10-880 was conducted between August 10th, 2010 (first subject visit) and May 14th , 2015 (last 
subject, last visit). Subjects were randomised and enrolled at 62 study sites located in Europe, US, 
Canada, Israel, Australia, Latin America, and Japan (sub-study).  
Conduct of the study 
•  Study M10-877 
The protocol was amended 10 times. The first 2 amendments were made before any subject had 
entered the study (Aug 2010). The last amendment was made Nov 2013, i.e. before last subject exited 
the study (Aug 2014). Amendments included e.g. changes to the overall study design, changes to 
efficacy endpoints, selection criteria and changes to ensure subject safety. Further, the sample size 
was increased since the overall treatment failure rate based on the masked study data was higher 
(60% at 6 months) than assumed for sample size calculation (50% at 6 months).  
Incomplete efficacy source data and general GCP compliance issues were found at 2 sites and 6 
subjects were excluded from the ITT analyses. One site (USA) was closed due to compliance issues 
and 4 placebo-treated and 1 adalimumab-treated subjects were excluded from the primary efficacy 
analysis. Another site (FR) had inadvertently misplaced/lost several subjects’ medical charts. The 
medical charts were partially reconstructed based on multiple sources but 1 placebo-treated subject 
was excluded from the primary efficacy analysis.  
Major protocol deviations were reported for 46 subjects (24 and 28 in the placebo-and in the 
adalimumab treatment groups, respectively). The main reasons were due to deviations from 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (16 deviations), use of prohibited concomitant medication (5 placebo, 9 
adalimumab), developed withdrawal criteria but were not withdrawn (11) and received wrong 
treatment or incorrect dose of prednisone (8). In addition, a number of compliance issues (regarded as 
minor by the Applicant) related to concomitant treatment were recorded, e.g. decreased 
immunosuppressive therapy during study (3), received CS to treat an AE (1) together with several CS 
tapering issues.  
•  Study M10-880 
The protocol was amended 11 times. The first amendment was made before any subject had entered 
the study (Aug 2010). The last amendment was made Feb 2014, i.e. before last subject exited the 
study (May 2015). Amendments were made for similar reasons as in Study M10-877 and also in this 
study, the sample size was increased to maintain a statistical power since the failure rate based on the 
masked study data was higher (35% at 6 months) than originally assumed (30% at 6 months).  
Incomplete efficacy source data and general GCP compliance issues were identified at the same sites 
as for study M10-877) which led to the exclusion of 3 placebo-treated subjects from the ITT analyses.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 31/108 
 
 
 
 
 
Major protocol deviations were reported for 54 subjects (23 and 31 in the placebo-and in the 
adalimumab treatment groups, respectively). The main reasons were due to use of prohibited 
concomitant medication (11 placebo, 19 adalimumab), deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria (18) 
and received wrong treatment or incorrect dose of adalimumab/placebo (7). In addition, a number of 
compliance issues (regarded as minor by the Applicant) related to concomitant treatment were 
recorded, e.g. decreased immunosuppressive therapy during study (5), received CS to treat an AE (5) 
together with several CS tapering issues. 
Baseline data 
Close to half of the subjects were between 30 and 49 years of age and somewhat more female than 
male patients were included in the studies. The majority of subjects were white (approximately 80%). 
Main baseline demographics and disease characteristics are summarised in the below tables. There 
were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms. 
In study M10-877, a total of 96 subjects were from Europe (Western and Eastern). The number of 
European subjects in study M10-880 was 119.  
The mean duration of uveitis was approximately 4 years. A total of 37 % of subjects had idiopathic 
uveitis and the majority of subjects (91%) had bilateral disease. The majority of the diagnoses listed 
as 'other' represent one of the categories of idiopathic, Birdshot choroidopathy, multifocal choroiditis 
and panuveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, sarcoid and Behçet's disease, but the investigator chose to 
report these as ‘other’.

Previous and concomitant medication 
Previous medication, i.e. any medication taken prior to the first dose of study drug and not necessarily 
discontinued before first study drug dose, included prednisone, prednisolone, mehtyleprednisolone, 
triamcinolone, MTX, ciclosporin, MMF, omeprazole, dexamethasone, betamethasone, folic acid, lekovit 
CA and azathioprine. All subjects used at least 1 previous medication. 
Prior uveitis-related medication was defined as any uveitis-related medication discontinued prior to the 
first dose of study drug as per protocol. Across both studies, over a third of all subjects (37.6% 
adalimumab and 36.4% placebo) used prior systemic IMM for the treatment of uveitis. Nearly all 
subjects used at least 1 prior CS for the treatment of uveitis. 
Concomitant medication was any medication, excluding the initial topical CS taper, that started prior to 
the first dose of study drug, and continued to be taken after the first dose of study drug, or any

medication that started after the first dose of the study drug, but not later than 14 days after the last 
dose of the study drug. The most frequently reported concomitant medication (≥ 20% subjects) in 
either treatment group was prednisolone and prednisone (see details below including Table 13 for CS 
use by generic name). Over a third of all subjects reported using at least 1 concomitant systemic IMM 
at baseline including MMF (or equivalent), MTX, ciclosporin and azathioprine (see details below 
including Table 14). 
•  Use of CS and taper 
With regards to the steroid taper, in both studies, CS doses were well balanced between treatment 
arms in both studies over the tapering periods. While in general, treatment compliance to the oral 
prednisone tapering schedule was greater than 97% for both treatment groups in both studies, the 
duration of the initial oral prednisone treatment was longer in the adalimumab treatment groups of 
both studies compared to placebo (see Table 13). The total steroid doses given during the studies were 
however similar between treatment groups in both studies. 
In both studies, subjects received a higher number of doses of topical CS in the adalimumab groups. 
During taper, the duration of exposure was higher in the adalimumab group compared to placebo in 
study M10-877. The mean duration of exposure to topical CS was also higher in study M10-880, 
whereas the median duration of exposure was longer in the placebo group compared to adalimumab. 
Treatment compliance (total dose received divided with the total dose planned) was >110 % in both 
groups in both studies, i.e. subjects either did not complete the taper in time or took a higher dose 
than assigned as per the taper schedule.

During study M10-877, prohibited prednisolone was taken by 15 (14.0%) subjects in the placebo 
group and 20 (18.2%) subjects in the adalimumab group. Six of these were reported as important 
protocol deviations. Prohibited prednisone (all systemic) was taken by 25 (23.4%) subjects in the 
placebo group and 15 (13.6%) subjects in the adalimumab group. Two of these were reported as 
important protocol deviations.  
During Study M10-880, prohibited prednisone was taken by 20 subjects (18.0%) in the placebo group

a In Study M10-877, subjects should have active disease despite treatment with ≥10 - ≤ 60 mg/day of prednisone 
(or equivalent) and all subjects received initial treatment with 60 mg/day of prednisone. In study M10-880, 
subjects were on 10-35 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent). 
Numbers analysed 
In study M10-877, 6 subjects at 2 sites were excluded from the ITT analyses due to incomplete 
efficacy source data and general GCP compliance issues at the sites; therefore, the ITT set is 
comprised of 217 subjects. No per protocol set was defined. 
For study M10-880, efficacy analyses are provided for the ITT set, which included all randomized 
subjects recruited outside Japan, and, excluded 3 subjects from 2 sites for which efficacy source data 
was incomplete and there were general GCP compliance issues.

Primary efficacy endpoint: Time to treatment failure 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, time to treatment failure at or after week 6 (composite 
of inflammatory, chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, AC cell grade, VH grade 
and logMAR BCVA) showed that the risk of treatment failure for subjects in the adalimumab group was 
reduced by 50% compared to subjects in the placebo group. The median times to treatment failure 
were 5.6 and 3 months in the adalimumab and placebo groups, respectively.

Sensitivity analyses by IMM use and with the mITT population supported the outcome, see Table and 
Figure below. 
Additional sensitivity analyses censoring subjects who prematurely discontinued due to an adverse 
event (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50, p<0.001), with major protocol deviations regarding 
deviations/prohibited use of CS (HR 0.47, p<0.001) and when considering the adverse event of uveitis 
(HR=0.50, p<0.001) as treatment failures were in line with the primary analysis in the ITT population.

Statistically significant differences were observed for the majority of the ranked secondary endpoints. 
For the endpoints Time to OCT evidence of macular oedema (4) and Change in VFQ-25 subscore 
distance vision (7), adalimumab was numerically in favour over placebo, but the difference did not 
reach statistical significance. Sensitivity analysis using the mITT set and analysing better/worse eye 
separately showed similar results as the primary analysis (ITT). 
The outcomes of the 9 ranked efficacy parameters are summarised in the below table.

Other efficacy endpoints 
Selected endpoints are summarised below. 
Mean AC cell grade, VH grade and logMAR BCVA over time were lower for the adalimumab group 
compared to the placebo group. The differences of the mean changes from best state achieved to 
Final/Early Termination visit were statistically significant (see also ranked secondary endpoints). When 
analysing the mean values (AC cell grade, VH grade and logMAR BCVA) as the areas under the curve 
(AUCs), at the final visit, values in the adalimumab group were higher compared to the placebo group 
and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p=0.008 for AC cell grade, 
p=0.004 for VH grade, and p=0.008 for logMAR BCVA). 
The proportions of subjects in quiescence, i.e. no active inflammatory lesions and AC cell grade ≤ 0.5 
and VH grade ≤ 0.5, with and without steroids at each visit between Baseline through Week 52 and 
between Week 20 through Week 52, respectively were higher in the adalimumab group (see Table 18). 
At Week 1, 38% and 30% of subjects had controlled disease in the placebo and adalimumab treatment

groups, respectively. At Week 4, the corresponding figures were 59% and 63%. Statistical significance 
while on CS was achieved from Week 8. 
Similar to quiescence, the results for the proportion of subjects with lack of inflammation/steroid-free 
lack of inflammation, i.e. no active inflammatory lesions and AC cell grade = 0 and VH grade = 0, were 
overall numerically in favour of adalimumab compared to placebo. Statistical significance was reached 
at some of the later time points (weeks 36 and 52).  
Sensitivity analyses taking into account major protocol deviations/prohibited CS use, the outcomes on 
proportions of patients in steroid-free quiescence and steroid-free lack of inflammation were similar to 
that obtained in the primary analysis.

According to the mandatory taper schedule, subjects were to discontinue prednisone no later than Week 
15 
NOTE: Subjects who do not have values at/after week 6 (e.g. due to premature discontinuation prior to week 6) 
were excluded. Source TABLE 14.2__2.1.4.3.M 
Beginning at Week 4 and through to Week 80/final visit, mean logMAR BCVA was lower and visual 
acuity was higher in both eyes in the adalimumab treatment group (Week 4: L and R = 0.16) 
compared to the placebo treatment group (Week 4: L = 0.17 and R = 0.18). The change in BCVA over 
time is illustrated in Figure 8.

• 
In all VFQ-25 subscales, the scores decreased in both treatment groups. However, smaller 
reductions from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to Final/Early Termination visit were 
observed in the adalimumab group compared to the placebo group, with the exception of 
colour vision. Mean reductions that were statistically significantly different between groups in 
favour of adalimumab included general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and 
total score (p values: 0.011, < 0.001, 0.036, 0.033, and 0.010, respectively). 
•  Similar reductions were observed in the adalimumab and placebo groups for HADS with no 
statistically significant differences between the groups. 
•  WPAI-SHP: At Final/Early Termination visit, the percentage of work time missed was similar 
between the adalimumab and placebo group; however, there was a larger reduction in work 
time missed in the adalimumab group compared to the placebo group (mean difference: 10.6 
%, CIs: -18.75, –2.47; p= 0.011). For percent impairment while working, overall work 
impairment, and activity impairment, reductions were greater for the adalimumab group 
compared to placebo without any statistically significant differences. 
•  At Final/Early Termination visit, values for EQ-5D predicted value and EQ VAS were higher in 
the adalimumab group compared to the placebo group. A statistically significant difference 
between groups in favour of adalimumab was observed only for the EQ-5D predicted value. 
Post hoc analyses 
In subjects with macular oedema and without macular hole/retinal detachment, a post hoc analysis 
was applied to time to OCT evidence of macular oedema and mean percent change in central retinal 
thickness in each eye from best state achieved prior to Week 6 to the Final/Early Termination visit 
using different cut-offs for centre point thickness depending on the OCT machine type. Statistically 
significant differences in favour of adalimumab versus placebo were observed. The risk of macular 
oedema for subjects in the adalimumab group was reduced by 67% compared to placebo (HR: 0.33, 
CIs: 0.12, 0.90; p= 0.023, main study data). Less increase in central retinal thickening was observed 
in subjects who received adalimumab compared to placebo (mean difference: 12 %, CIs: –21.5, –2.5; 
p= 0.014). 
The proportion of subjects in disease control (defined as no new active inflammatory lesions, AC cell 
grade ≤ 0.5, VH grade ≤ 0.5, and no worsening of logMAR BCVA by ≥ 15 letters to best state 
achieved) was numerically higher for the placebo group at Week 1 (38%) compared to adalimumab 
(30%), and numerically higher for the adalimumab group at Week 4 (63%) compared to placebo 
(59%). There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups at Week 1 or Week 
4. 
•  Study M10-880 (VISUAL II) 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Time to treatment failure  
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (time to treatment failure at or after Week 2) showed 
that the risk of treatment failure for subjects in the adalimumab group was reduced by 43% compared 
to subjects in the placebo group. The median time to treatment failure was 8.3 months for placebo 
subjects and not estimable (> 18 months) for adalimumab subjects because fewer than half of the 
subjects experienced treatment failure at the conclusion of the study.  
Sensitivity analysis of time to treatment failure using the mITT set showed similar results to the 
primary analysis. Additional sensitivity analyses censoring subjects with major protocol deviations 
regarding deviations/prohibited use of CS (HR 0.55, p=0.013) and when considering the adverse

There were generally fewer triggers leading to treatment failure in subjects receiving adalimumab than 
in subjects receiving placebo. Numerical differences in favour of adalimumab were shown for active 
inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade, and VH grade, but the differences were not statistically significant 
(see Table 23). The risk for treatment failure due to a decrease in the BCVA component was 
significantly lower in the adalimumab group.

cells (≥2 units), VH score (≥2 units) or CRT (≥50 μm) in 13 placebo-treated and in 
8 adalimumab-treated subjects. In 8 additional placebo-treated subjects and 2 adalimumab-
treated subjects, there were signs of disease activity but below the thresholds set for 
treatment failure. In 2 placebo-treated and in no adalimumab-treated subjects there was a loss 
of BCVA without (or essentially without) any other sign of disease activity. In addition, a 
number of subjects developed cataract changes. 
•  Sensitivity analyses (AC and VH = 0 and AC or VH < 0.5 at baseline) demonstrated that 
adalimumab was superior to placebo in both subgroups (HR 0.33, p=0.017 and HR 0.34, p= 
0.003, respectively). 
Secondary efficacy 
No statistically significant differences were observed between the treatment groups for any of the 
ranked secondary efficacy variables. The outcomes were numerically in favour of adalimumab for all 
ranked variables except for Change in VFQ-25 subscore near vision (8). Sensitivity analysis using the 
mITT set and analysis of the better/worse eye separately showed similar results as the primary 
analysis (ITT).  
The outcomes of the 9 ranked efficacy parameters are summarised in the below table.

Other efficacy endpoints 
Selected endpoints are summarised below. 
Mean AC cell grade, VH grade and logMAR BCVA over time were lower for the adalimumab group 
compared to the placebo group. Mean AUC of AC cell grade, VH grade and logMAR BCVA at final visit 
were higher for the adalimumab group compared to the placebo group and the differences between the 
groups were statistically significant (p=0.010 for AC cell grade, p=0.007 for VH grade and p=0.009 for 
logMAR BCVA). 
Categorical changes in BCVA from best state achieved prior to Week 6 at selected time points are 
summarised in the below table.

The proportion of subjects with lack of lack of inflammation (defined as no active inflammatory lesions 
and AC cell grade = 0 and VH grade = 0) at each visit from Baseline through Week 40 was statistically 
significantly higher in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group beginning at Week 4.  
The proportions of subjects with AC cell grade of 0 (absence of flare) in each eye was also consistently 
higher in the adalimumab group compared to the placebo group starting at Week 2 and continuing to 
the final value. The same trend was observed for VH grade. 
Sensitivity analyses taking into account major protocol deviations/prohibited CS use resulted in similar 
outcomes for proportions of patients in steroid-free quiescence and steroid-free lack of inflammation as 
in the primary analyses. 
For the majority of PROs, adalimumab was favoured over placebo:  
•  Smaller mean reductions (worsening) or larger increases (improvements) in VFQ-25 scores 
from baseline to Final/Early Termination visit were observed in the adalimumab group 
compared to the placebo group, with the exception of colour vision, peripheral vision, and near 
vision (ranked secondary endpoint 8). Mean reductions that were statistically significantly 
different between groups in favour of adalimumab included general vision and mental health 
(p=0.003, and p=0.022, respectively). 
•  Similar reductions were observed in the adalimumab and placebo groups for HADS with no 
statistically significant differences between the groups. 
•  WPAI-SHP: The percent of work time missed, impairment while working, overall work 
impairment, and activity impairment showed greater increases from Baseline for the 
adalimumab group compared to the placebo group without any statistically significant 
differences between groups. 
•  At Final/Early Termination visit, values for EQ-5D predicted value and EQ VAS were similar for 
adalimumab and placebo groups. 
2.4.2.3.  Ancillary analyses 
Anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) 
See section 2.3.2. for the results of the AAA tests.  
In study M10-877, the median (range) time to treatment failure was 15 (6 – 52) weeks for AAA– 
subjects. All four AAA+ subjects had treatment failure with a median (range) time to treatment failure 
of 32 (16 – 48) weeks. In study M10-880, the median (range) time to treatment failure was 16 (4 – 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 47/108 
 
 
 
 
  
60) weeks for AAA– subjects. Six out of eight (6/8) AAA+ subjects had treatment failure with a median 
(range) time to treatment failure of 16 (10 – 31) weeks.   
Subgroup analyses  
Analyses of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints were conducted for study M10-877 and study 
M10-880 for several subgroups. The following is noted for the primary endpoint: 
•  Age: Results were in favour of adalimumab in 5 out of 6 subgroups, the largest difference in 
favour of adalimumab was observed at ages ≥ 30 to < 50 years subgroups for both studies. 
•  Gender: Adalimumab was favoured in males and females with a larger effect in males. In 
females, the difference between treatment arms with regards the time to failure was one 
month (both studies). 
•  Anatomical location:  Subgroup analyses were in favour of adalimumab in 5 out of 6 
subgroups. The exception was posterior uveitis in Study M10 880, where results for posterior 
uveitis were not directionally in favour of adalimumab. 
•  Diagnosis:  Statistical analysis was performed only in cases where 20 or more subjects per 
group were available (i.e., idiopathic [both studies M10-877 and M10-880], birdshot 
choroidopathy [study M10-877] and VKH [study M10-880]). For idiopathic uveitis, the largest 
subgroup based on diagnosis, there was a statistically significant difference in time to 
treatment failure in favour of adalimumab compared to placebo in both studies and there was 
a numerical advantage in favour of adalimumab compared to placebo for the birdshot 
choroidopathy subgroup in study M10-877 and for the VKH subgroup in study M10-880. 
Adalimumab was not favoured in posterior uveitis and sarcoidosis in study M10-880 and 
seemed less favoured in intermediate uveitis in study M10-877. 
•  Duration of disease: Compared to subjects with a shorter (<1 year) disease duration, the 
efficacy of adalimumab was reduced in subjects with a longer duration (≥ 1 year) of the 
disease in study M10-880, while the opposite was demonstrated in study M10-877. 
• 
Previous uveitis flares: In study M10-880, subjects with 0-1 uveitis flares during the last 
12 months and those with ≥ 6 months since the last flare, did not gain any additional benefit 
of adalimumab. 
•  Region: Adalimumab was favoured in the US as well as in the EU regions. 
• 
Previous uveitis flares: In study M10-880, subjects with 0-1 uveitis flares during the last 
12 months and those with ≥ 6 months since the last flare, did not gain any additional benefit 
of adalimumab. With regards to treatment failure in the subset of patients with ≥2 flares in the 
12 months prior to baseline, the HR was 0.23 (p=0.003). In this subset, the difference 
between adalimumab and placebo subjects observed in AC cell grade was statistically 
significant (HR 0.47, p=0.027). 
•  Weight: Adalimumab was favoured in the analysis by weight (<68 kg, ≥68 to <80 kg, ≥80 to 
<92 kg and ≥92 kg). 
• 
Immunomodulatory therapy: Results were in favour of adalimumab in all 4 subgroups. 
(adalimumab yes/no in either of the 2 studies). In subjects with no use of immunomodulators 
in studies M10-877 and M10-880, the respective outcomes were: HR 0.49, p<0.001, HR 0.64, 
p=0.068 
•  Use of prohibited CS (topical and/or systemic and topical): In both studies, censoring subjects 
with protocol deviations/any prohibited CS use were consistent with that obtained in the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 48/108 
 
 
 
 
primary analysis with a clearly maintained statistical significance (p <0.001 and 0.013 in 
studies M10-877 and M10-880, respectively). Furthermore, the outcomes in the ranked 
secondary analyses were largely consistent with those of the initial analyses, i.e. in most 
analyses adalimumab was favoured over placebo. Subgroup analyses by prohibited use of 
topical CS did not change the overall outcomes. 
Of the more than 50 subgroups analysed, in study M10-877 adalimumab was disfavoured only in one 
subgroup: prednisone dose ≥15 to <30 mg/day at last flare (n=22, HR 1.54). In study M10-880, 
adalimumab was disfavoured in five subgroups: age ≥ 50 years (n=74, HR 1.10), race black (n=14, 
HR=1.49), posterior uveitis (n=73, HR=1.02), sarcoid including Japanese subjects (n=42, HR 1.09), 
time since last flare ≥6 months (n=77, HR 1.31). For none of the subgroup analyses was the placebo 
treatment group favoured in both studies and overall. 
Japanese sub-studies 
The methodologies for the sub-studies were as for the main studies. 
•  Study M10-877 – Active uveitis 
A total of 16 of the originally planned subjects were enrolled since the main study reached its target 
number of treatment failures before enrolment of the substudy was completed. No subjects 
prematurely discontinued study drug.  
The majority of subjects were female, all were Japanese, and mean age was 51 years. There were 
some differences in age (< 40 years), body weight, and tobacco use between the placebo and 
adalimumab groups, but overall demographic characteristics were similar.  
Almost half (7) of the patients were diagnosed with idiopathic uveitis, 6 with sarcoid, 2 with Behçet's 
and 1 with Vogt Koyanagi Harada. For Baseline characteristics, the treatment groups were numerically 
similar, but more subjects in the adalimumab treatment group had macular oedema at Baseline. 
All subjects used prior uveitis-related CS and 12 subjects used topical CS (5 in the placebo and 7 in the 
adalimumab group). Overall, 3 subjects (2 placebo and 1 adalimumab) reported concomitant systemic 
IMM at Baseline. No imbalance between adalimumab and placebo groups in the deviations relating to 
prohibited steroids or IMM dosage during the study was noted.  
The median times to treatment failure (primary efficacy) were 2.8 and 2.4 months in the placebo and 
adalimumab groups, respectively, with 6/8 (75%) and 8/8 (100%) treatment failures (HR: 1.20, 95% 
CI: 0.41, 3.54). The integrated analysis of the main study and the Japanese substudy data resulted n 
a difference between treatment arms of less than 2 months (3.0 vs. 4.8 months, p<0.001).  
•  Study M10-880 – Inactive uveitis 
A total of 32 subjects were enrolled. One subject in each treatment group prematurely discontinued 
the study. One adalimumab subject discontinued due to an AE and one placebo subject was incorrectly 
assessed as treatment failure and the subject enrolled in the extension study. 
The majority of subjects were female, all were Japanese (one Japanese/Korean), and mean age was 
47 years. There were some differences in age (< 40 years), body weight, alcohol and tobacco use 
between the placebo and adalimumab groups, but overall demographic characteristics were similar.  
Four subjects in each treatment arm were diagnosed with idiopathic uveitis, 4 (placebo) and 
8 (adalimumab) with Vogt Koyanagi Harada, 6 (placebo) and 4 (adalimumab) with sarcoid, 1 (placebo) 
with Behçet's and 1 (placebo) with “Other” uveitis. For baseline characteristics, the treatment groups 
were similar. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 49/108 
 
 
 
 
All subjects used prior uveitis-related CS and 12 subjects used topical CS (15 in placebo and 12 in the 
adalimumab group). Overall, 3 subjects (1 placebo and 2 adalimumab) reported concomitant systemic 
IMM at Baseline. Although prohibited, systemic oral prednisolone was taken by 9/16 subject in the 
placebo group.  
The median times to treatment failure (primary efficacy) were 2.1 and 2.9 months in the placebo and 
adalimumab treatment groups, respectively, with 14/16 (87.5%) and 12/16 (75.0%) treatment 
failures (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20, 1.03).

Notes 
a) The number of patients for the secondary endpoints was the number of 
subjects with non-missing values; for the other endpoints the number of 
patients excluded patients who had to terminate the study because the 
planned number of treatment failures was reached. 
Difference between treatment arms for time to treatment failure was less 
than 2 months (3.0 vs. 4.8 months, p<0.001) when including the Japanese 
subgroup (n=16). No benefit of adalimumab in Japanese patients.  
Several subgroup analyses were conducted. There appeared to be overall 
consistency, but the effect in women were less convincing.

a) The number of patients for the secondary endpoints was the number of 
subjects with non-missing values; for the other endpoints the number of 
patients excluded patients who had to terminate the study because the 
planned number of treatment failures was reached. 
Integrating the Japanese subgroup of patients (n=32) did not affect the 
overall outcome. Although small differences between treatment arms in this 
subset were observed, there was a trend towards a favour for adalimumab.  
Several subgroup analyses were conducted. There appeared to be overall 
consistency, but the effect in women was less convincing. 
2.4.3.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study M11-327 - A Multicenter Open-Label Study of the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of the 
Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab in Subjects with Non-infectious 
Intermediate-, Posterior-, or Pan-uveitis 
Study M11-327 (also referred to as VISUAL III) is an ongoing, open-label extension of studies M10-
877 and M10-880. Eligible subjects participated in study M10-877 or study M10-880m, and either

discontinued from the studies for having met the endpoint of Treatment Failure or remained in the 
studies until completion or until the study was stopped. 
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Subject must have successfully enrolled in either study M10-877 or M10-880 and either met 
the endpoint of "Treatment Failure" or completed the study. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
•  A subject will be excluded from this study if the patient prematurely discontinued from Study 
M10-877 or Study M10-880 for any reason other than having a Treatment Failure event. 
•  Subject with corneal or lens opacity that precludes visualization of the fundus or that likely 
requires cataract surgery during the duration of the trial. 
•  Subjects with IOP of ≥ 25 mmHg and on ≥ 2 glaucoma medications or evidence of 
glaucomatous optic nerve injury. 
•  Subject with proliferative or severe NPDR or clinically significant DME. 
•  Subject with neovascular/wet AMD. 
•  Subject with abnormality of vitreo-retinal interface (i.e., vitreomacular traction, epiretinal 
membranes, etc.) with the potential for macular structural damage independent of the 
inflammatory process. 
•  Subject with a systemic inflammatory disease that requires therapy with a prohibited 
immunosuppressive agent at the time of study entry. 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of SC adalimumab 40 mg given 
eow. Long-term efficacy will also be assessed. 
Number of subjects to be enrolled: Estimated 400 subjects who participated in one of the preceding 
phase 3 studies, Study M10-877 or Study M10-880, and who are eligible for this study based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Treatment 
All subjects receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg dose eow SC regardless of treatment assignment in 
the randomized, double-masked studies. 
As subjects who discontinue from study M10-877 or M10-880 due to "Treatment Failure" were 
considered to have active disease at time of entry into study M11-327, concomitant therapy with CS 
(oral or topical) and/or any one of the immunosuppressive therapies permitted in study M10-877 and 
study M10-880 will be allowed as necessary to control intraocular inflammation.  
Subjects who successfully completed study M10-877 or M10-880 and have inactive disease at time of 
entry into study M11-327 may continue, taper and/or discontinue concomitant CS and/or one 
immunosuppressive therapy based on the Investigator's clinical judgment. 
Study visits occur at Week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and every 12 weeks thereafter. 
Efficacy assessments were performed at every visit. Subjects who enter the study due to Treatment 
Failure in Study M10-877 or Study M10-880 and fail to achieve adequate control of their disease flare 
within the first 8 weeks of Study M11-327 may discontinue from the study. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 56/108 
 
 
 
 
Any other subject experiencing a uveitis flare during the study as determined by the investigator may 
discontinue the study at any time. Subjects were allowed to continue in the study, if it was determined 
by the investigator that the flare was triggered by a reduction or discontinuation in concomitant CS or 
systemic immunosuppressive therapy where further adjustment to the concomitant therapy may be 
warranted. Any subject continuing to have an active uveitis flare in the opinion of the investigator for 
4 weeks or more should be discontinued from the study. 
Safety data will be collected in the form of adverse events, physical examination, vital signs and 
laboratory tests throughout the treatment period and up to 70 days after the last dose of study drug. 
All subjects will have a 70-day follow-up phone call or visit to obtain follow-up information on any new 
or ongoing adverse events. The 70-day follow-up phone call or clinic visit will not be required for any 
subject that initiates commercial adalimumab. 
Efficacy variables include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects at each study time point with no new active, inflammatory chorioretinal 
or inflammatory retinal vascular lesion in both eyes relative to Baseline for subjects who had 
inactive uveitis when they entered the study and to Week 8 for subjects who had active uveitis 
when they entered the study. 
Proportion of subjects at each study time point with a Grade ≤ 0.5+ in AC cells in both eyes on 
Slit Lamp Exam according to SUN criteria. 
Proportion of subjects at each study time point with a Grade ≤ 0.5+ in VH in both eyes on 
indirect ophthalmoscopy according to NEI/SUN criteria. 
Proportion of subjects at each study time point without a worsening of BCVA by ≥ 15 letters on 
the ETDRS in both eyes relative to Baseline for subjects who had inactive uveitis when they 
entered the study and to Week 8 for subjects who had active uveitis when they entered the 
study. 
Percent change in central retinal thickness (1 mm subfield) in each eye at each study time 
point relative to Baseline for subjects who had inactive uveitis when they entered the study 
and to Week 8 for subjects who had active uveitis when they entered the study. 
•  Change in NEI VFQ-25 score at each study time point relative to Baseline for subjects who had 
inactive uveitis when they entered the study and to Week 8 for subjects who had active uveitis 
when they entered the study. 
• 
Proportion of subjects at each study time point achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in 
immunosuppression load relative to Baseline for subjects who had inactive uveitis when they 
entered the study and to Week 8 for subjects who had active uveitis when they entered the 
study. 
Other efficacy variables include: WPAI-SHP, EQ-5D and Health Resource Utilization Questionnaire 
(HRU). 
Safety will be assessed by adverse events, laboratory data, physical examinations and vital signs 
throughout the study. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT set which includes all subjects that received at least one dose 
of study drug in Study M11-327. All statistical analyses were descriptive. Results were stratified 
between subjects who entered into the study with active versus inactive uveitis. For subjects who had 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 57/108 
 
 
 
 
active uveitis when they entered the study, the efficacy analyses started at Week 8. For subjects who 
had inactive uveitis when they entered the study, the efficacy analyses started at Week 0. Continuous 
variables were summarized by the number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, 
median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables were summarized by counts and 
percentages. 
Outcome – cut-off date 31 August 2015 
Extent of exposure 
The first subject entered the study in November 2010. A total of 423 subjects received at least 1 dose 
of adalimumab during the study. Of these, 371 were included in the ITT set. Within the ITT set, a total  
of 243 subjects had active uveitis at study entry and 128 subjects had inactive uveitis at study entry. 
Of the 48 Japanese subjects enrolled in the 2 sub-studies of M10-877 and M10-880, 39 subjects (ITT 
set) rolled over to the open label extension study and at the cut-off date, 28 subjects continued in the 
study. 
Data up to 174 weeks (inactive uveitis at study entry) and 222 weeks (active uveitis at study entry) 
have been presented. By the cut-off date of 31 August 2015, one subject has finalised the study and 
257 subjects (ITT set) remains in the study.

Participant flow  
At the cut-of date, one subject had finalised the study and 257 subjects remained in the study. A total 
of 113 of 371 subjects (ITT) discontinued from the study. The most common reason for premature 
discontinuation from the study was AE. Amongst the subjects entering the study with controlled uveitis 
no subject discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy. Among the 243 subjects with active disease 
at entry, 27 subjects (12.4%) prematurely discontinued due to lack of efficacy (based on investigator’s 
judgement). Amongst the 235 subjects with active uveitis and values at Week 8 or later, 20 (8.5%) 
had a flare and prematurely discontinued due to lack of efficacy.  
The mean (±SD) and median (range) durations of exposure to adalimumab for the all adalimumab 
analysis set (n=464) were 81.1 (± 57.6) and 68.1 (1.6 – 243.4) weeks, respectively. Three hundred 
thirty-five (335) subjects were treated with adalimumab for > 48 weeks and 38 subjects for > 192 
weeks. 
Analysis of efficacy 
Evaluations of efficacy started at Week 8 for subjects who entered the study with active uveitis. From 
those entering the study with inactive uveitis, efficacy was evaluated from Baseline.  
The mean dose of systemic CS at study entry was higher in subjects who had active non-infectious 
uveitis compared to subjects who had inactive non-infectious uveitis. In general, the mean dose of CS 
for all subjects (those with active or inactive disease at Week 0) decreased over time starting at Week 
2. Subjects entering the extension study without active disease generally maintained a low daily dose 
of CS over time (< 2 mg) while subjects with a flare at study start had a reduction in daily dose of CS 
over time, from approximately 14 mg at study entry to approximately 4 mg after one year. Overall, 
the majority of subjects with controlled (inactive) uveitis at entry were not on concomitant CS 
(systemic and non-systemic) while the majority of subjects that entered the study with active uveitis 
were on concomitant CS during the first part of the study whereafter this proportion declined. Overall, 
40/55 (73%) and 83/171 (48 %) of subjects who entered the study with controlled and active uveitis, 
respectively, did not receive any concomitant systemic and/or local CS after 1 year. 
The time to treatment failure (as defined for the primary endpoint in the main studies) for subjects 
entering the study with active and inactive uveitis is summarised in the below table.

Among subjects that entered the study with active uveitis and experienced a treatment failure (54%), 
for most subjects (30%) this was followed by a period of disease control. Among the subjects with 
active uveitis at study entry, the previously placebo-treated subjects (n=136) were overall better 
controlled than those that were treated with adalimumab (n=107) in the core studies. However also 
the subjects who failed on adalimumab in the core studies seemed to benefit from continued treatment 
(median time to failure 9.7 months). Furthermore, there were 25 subjects joining the study with active 
inflammation who did not receive concomitant CS. Of these, 13 (52.0%) reached quiescence at Week 
8. 
Reasons for treatment failures in subjects that entered the study with inactive uveitis were due to the 
following: lesions n=5, AC cells n=7, VH n=1, BCVA loss n=6. Most of these patients met 1 (n=13) of

the reasons for failure, a few met 2 (n=3). For those with active uveitis at study entry, the reasons for 
treatment failures were due to the following: lesions n=26, AC cells n=42, VH n=56, BCVA loss n=36. 
These patients met 1 (n=111), 2 (n=14) or 3 (n=7) of the reasons for failure. 
For patients who experienced a flare at Week 8 or later, no subjects with controlled (inactive) disease 
at study entry discontinued due to the flare and 20/154 (8.5%) subjects with active disease at study 
entry discontinued due to the flare. 
The proportions of subjects at each study time point who had no new active, inflammatory 
chorioretinal or inflammatory retinal vascular lesion in both eyes was ≥ 93% at all-time points beyond 
Week 12 independent on whether the subjects entered the study with active or inactive uveitis . 
The proportion of subjects with a AC cell grade ≤ 0.5 in in both eyes, at study entry, was higher for 
subjects enrolling with inactive disease compared to those enrolling with active disease (96% and 
50%, respectively). For subjects with inactive disease, the proportions with an AC cell grade ≤0.5 
remained high (92-100 %) over the 174 weeks. For those enrolling in the study with active disease, 
there was a substantial increase in the proportions of subjects remaining in the study that had an AC 
cell grade ≤0.5  in both eyes (50 % at Week 0 and > 81% from Week 12 through Week 222). 
The proportion of subjects at each study time point with a VH grade ≤ 0.5 in both eyes was higher for 
subjects enrolling with inactive disease compared to those enrolling with active disease (92.1% and 
40.6%, respectively). For subjects with inactive disease, the proportions with an VH grade ≤0.5 
remained high (80-100%) over the 174 weeks. For those enrolling in the study with active disease, 
there was a substantial increase in the proportions of subjects remaining in the study that had a VH 
grade ≤0.5 in both eyes (41% at Week 0 and > 78% from Week 8 through Week 222). 
Mean BCVA in subjects that entered the extension study with controlled (inactive) disease remained 
essentially unchanged over the duration of the study without any trends of worsening. In the subjects 
that entered the study with active uveitis, when the flare was controlled, BCVA seemed to improve. 
During the extension, there were no major differences between males and females with regards to 
inflammation and CS usage. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two global phase 3 studies form the main basis of this application, one in patients with active uveitis 
not controlled on ≥10 to ≤60 mg prednisolone or oral corticosteroid (CS) equivalent per day (study 
M10-877, VISION I) and one in patients with inactive uveitis controlled on ≥10 to ≤35 mg prednisone 
or equivalent (study M10-880, VISION II). In addition, preliminary efficacy data from an ongoing, open 
label extension study (M11-327, VISION III) that enrolled subjects from the pivotal phase 3 trials have 
been provided. 
No dose-response study has been conducted. In both pivotal phase 3 trials, an adalimumab 
maintenance regimen of 40 mg eow following an initial loading dose of 80 mg was tested based on 
experience with this regimen in psoriasis patients. However, steady-state serum adalimumab 
concentrations were on the lower side of the therapeutic dose range and exposure-response analyses 
indicated that uveitis patients with treatment failure had lower exposures compared to those without 
treatment failure (see section 2.3.2. ). It could therefore not be excluded that the selected dose might 
have been too low, or, alternatively a higher dosing frequency may have been needed to achieve 
maximum efficacy. This view was shared by an expert panel convened by the CHMP (see report from 
the meeting below). Additional clinical trial simulations indicated an increased benefit in case of weekly 
40 mg doses compared to 40 mg eow of approximately 15% less subjects with treatment failures (see 
section 2.3.2. ). However, as this finding was based on simulations, no firm conclusions could be

drawn. However, weekly dosing has been reported/recommended in difficult to control patients in the 
published literature (Wood, US Pharmacist, 2011; Baughman et al., Sarcoidosis vasculitis and diffuse 
lung diseases 2012; Reddy and Albini, Retina today, 2015; Dubel, Handbook of Therapeutic Antibodies 
Vol 2, 2nd edition, 2014). Further, weekly dosing in other indications for Humira has not been 
associated with any major safety concerns. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that the MAH should 
study the weekly dosing regimen in the uveitis indication post-approval. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Together, both pivotal studies randomised more than 450 subjects in the main studies and additional 
48 subjects in the Japanese sub-studies, which was recognised by the CHMP as a rather high number 
of patients in view of the rarity of the disease. The study duration of 80 weeks or until the predefined 
number of events of treatment failures was reached was considered acceptable.  
In both studies, patients received open label oral prednisone at the start of the studies. In study 
M10-877, all subjects received a prednisone burst of 60 mg/day at randomisation. This approach was 
considered acceptable, as intense treatment is in line with general uveitis treatment recommendations 
in order to obtain a rapid control of the inflammation and, considering that the comparison was 
conducted against placebo, necessary from an ethical perspective. CS were then tapered in a 
standardised and pre-defined manner during 15 and 19 weeks in the respective studies, which was 
broadly consistent with recommended schedules in uveitis treatment guidelines. A taper from 60 
mg/day over 15 week as performed in study M10-877 was however rather aggressive, but aimed to 
induce treatment failures, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP in the clinical trial context. 
Steroid taper was started after 2 weeks and 1 week in patients with active and inactive uveitis, 
respectively. To ensure that the exposure of adalimumab has reached steady state, it is advised for 
clinical practice that CS taper can be started 2 week after treatment initiation with Humira (see 
discussion below on the steroid sparing effect).  
Overall, in both studies, CS doses were well balanced between treatment arms during the tapering 
periods. While the durations of the initial oral prednisone treatment were longer in the adalimumab 
treatment groups, the total exposure was similar between treatment arms in the respective studies, 
which was considered reassuring by the CHMP.  
Any topical steroids used at Baseline were further to be tapered according to a predefined schedule, 
which was considered acceptable. Also, in both phase 3 studies, one additional concomitant IMM at 
stable doses was allowed, which was considered a reasonable approach as such combined treatment is 
in line with current clinical practice. 
The selection criteria were overall adequate to capture the targeted patient population which consisted 
of subjects with a wide range of uveitis disease aetiologies, e.g. idiopathic, Birdshot choroidopathy, 
VKH, sarcoid and Behçet's disease. However, there were concerns that the cut-off set for prior 
intra/peri-ocular CS (6 months in case of dexamethasone intravitreal implants and 30 days for all other 
CS) may have been too short to exclude a treatment effect. This was addressed in further analyses by 
the MAH, showing that only 7 adalimumab-treated subjects and 2 placebo-treated subjects in study 
M10-877 terminated IVT dexamethasone or IVT/periocular triamcinolone within 12 or 6 months, 
respectively, before start of study M10-877. Due to the fairly low number of subjects, an impact on the 
overall study outcome was unlikely. Furthermore, the majority of subjects who received topical CS 
within 30 days prior to baseline were randomized to the placebo treatment group. A bias in favour of 
adalimumab was thus unlikely. The MAH also provided further reassurance on the prior use of VEGF 
inhibitors and no impact on the study results was expected in this regard. 
The primary endpoints in both studies, time to treatment failure, were defined as composite endpoints 
that not only included assessment of VH score, but also assessment of inflammatory lesions, AC cell 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 61/108 
 
 
 
 
scores and BCVA. The 4 components were acknowledged by the CHMP as relevant in the assessment 
of uveitis as per the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group. As reported in the 
CPMP/EWP/908/99 guideline on points to consider on multiplicity issues in clinical trials, a composite 
endpoint must be ‘capable to providing the key evidence of efficacy that it is needed for a licence”. 
Indeed, eye function (i.e. visual acuity), a hard clinical endpoint, is considered the ideal primary 
outcome measure for clinical trials in ophthalmology. However, there are several difficulties in 
selecting visual acuity as outcome measure in uveitis patients. Glaucoma and cataract can reduce 
vision in these patients even when uveitis is well controlled, and stratifying the patient population for 
factors affecting vision is not always feasible. Further, patients with a long-standing oedema or even a 
subclinical inflammation, may not have the potential to re-gain any (or only some) of the lost vision. 
Further, subjects in the two studies had overall a relatively mild visual impairment at Baseline, thus 
leaving little room for improvement. As a consequence, most of the trials in uveitis of the posterior eye 
segment have used as primary efficacy variable VH score only. However, by including all components, 
it is more likely to detect an inflammation and the primary endpoint will thus be more sensitive. For 
these reasons and given that the goal in treating non-infectious uveitis is to control acute 
inflammation, limit recurrences, reduce the dose of systemic steroids and limit the decline in visual 
acuity, the definition of treatment failures was agreed by the CHMP and the primary endpoints of both 
studies was considered to be of clinically relevance.   
In study M10-877 (active uveitis), treatment failures were counted on or after Week 6 to allow time for 
subjects to reach a common level of quiescence following the protocol-specified prednisone burst. This 
implies by definition that no subject could have a shorter time to treatment failure than 6 weeks, which 
in fact will be the case for many patients in clinical practice. However, it is not believed that this 
approach caused an overestimation of the time to failure and the methodology for the primary 
endpoint analysis was considered appropriate. Furthermore, based on interim analyses, the sample 
sizes in the studies were increased since the overall rate of treatment failures was higher than 
expected. The interim analyses for sample size re-estimation were not formally planned in the study 
protocols, but did not cause concerns regarding control of the type I error. In study M10-877 (active 
uveitis), the primary endpoint also included the proportion of patients that did not achieve quiescence 
by Week 6. This was considered highly reasonable since it is of critical importance to obtain a rapid 
control of the inflammation, and it could even have been considered to focus on this aspect in this 
study. 
The secondary and other endpoints that cover aspects of the individual components of the primary 
endpoint, macular oedema and PROs were generally appropriate, although the rationale behind the 
order of the ranked secondary endpoints was not clear as they were analysed independently whether 
or not the previous endpoint reached statistical significance. Further, time to event analyses included 
treatment failure in any eye, however, since the quality of life of patients with uveitis likely depends on 
the vision of the best seeing-eye, the assessment of visual acuity of the best seeing-eye may have 
been more informative to understand the real benefit of the study drug.  
In addition, several subgroup and post-hoc analyses were conducted. For study M10-877 (but not for 
study M10-880), the time to failures for the BCVA component of the primary endpoint was evaluated 
post hoc. This is highly reasonable and endorsed, but the usual limitations of post-hoc analyses apply. 
Similarly, as it is of high importance to obtain rapid disease control, the post hoc analyses at earlier 
time-points than 6 weeks were acknowledged by the CHMP to provide information on whether high 
dose CS in combination with adalimumab could shorten the time to quiescence. However, there were 
no expectations with regards to the Week 1 analyses when subjects are still on 60mg prednisone per 
day.

With regards to the overall conduct of the studies, all protocol amendments appear to have been taken 
place before unmasking the studies. Due to GCP-violations, the ITT analysis excluded a small number 
of patients, which was considered by the CHMP sufficiently justified. However, no PP set was generated 
although there were several protocol deviations including prohibited use of CS by several patients 
during the study. The latter were of concern since prohibited use of CS may well have had an impact 
on the outcome of the study. The MAH explained that the vast majority of steroid related deviations 
were related to the taper schedule and doses. They were mainly due to an early (few days) or late step 
down or other minor nonconformities. In addition, several sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
and ranked secondary endpoint as well as re-analyses of proportion of patients reaching 
quiescence/lack of inflammation with and without CS counting major deviations/prohibited medication 
as failures as well as subgroup analyses by prohibited medication have been provided. Taken together, 
the analyses showed that CS related deviations were unlikely to have had a major impact on the 
outcome of the studies. 
Protocol deviations regarded as minor in the study reports included a number of subjects that 
decreased their concomitant immunosuppressive therapy during the study, while they should have 
been on stable doses. In addition, some subjects received CS to treat an AE. However, due to the 
overall balanced distribution of these deviations between treatment arms, the CHMP considered that 
any bias in favour of adalimumab treatment was unlikely. 
Baseline demographics were generally well balanced between treatment arms. With regards to disease 
characteristics, in study M10-877, subjects in the placebo-treatment group had a longer mean and 
median duration of uveitis. A shorter duration of uveitis, however, does not necessarily translate into a 
less severe disease. Subgroup analyses by disease duration (<1 and ≥1 year) were inconclusive due to 
the limitedness of the data. No further action was considered warranted by the CHMP. 
With regards to the disease characteristics, the CHMP noted that uveitis distribution according to 
aetiology in the studies did not fully reflect the known epidemiology of the disease as the vast majority 
of uveitis types represented in the trials had no or very mild systemic involvement. Patients with 
Behçet’s disease and sarcoidosis were underrepresented, probably because of the difficulties of 
enrolling patients with such severe diseases in a clinical trial. VKH and Birdshot’s disease are rare 
forms and therefore expected to be poorly represented. Furthermore, in both studies a larger 
proportion of subjects in the placebo-treatment groups had idiopathic uveitis while more subjects in 
the adalimumab groups had the difficult to treat Behçet's disease. However, subgroup analyses 
showed the adalimumab was favoured in most types and diagnoses of uveitis in both studies with the 
only exceptions of posterior uveitis and sarcoidosis in study M10-880 (see further discussion below).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
• 
Efficacy outcomes - active uveitis (study M10-877, VISION I) 
The overall treatment failure rate was high in both treatment arms with 79% (84/107) and 55% 
(60/110) in patients receiving placebo and adalimumab, respectively). This may be explained by the 
choice of a composite endpoint including 4 components representing a sensitive measure of 
inflammation. Furthermore, the rather aggressive steroid taper may have contributed to the high 
failure rates. With regards to the primary efficacy variable, median time to treatment failure was 
longer in the adalimumab arm compared to placebo (5.6 versus 3.0 months). The Kaplan-Meier curve 
started to separate early and the separation was sustained up to Week 80, supporting maintenance of 
the treatment effect. Still, the magnitude of the effect was limited with less than a 3 months difference 
between treatment groups. However, from a statistical point of view, efficacy has been convincingly 
demonstrated (p<0.001) and there is a 50% reduction in the risk (95% CI 0.36, 0.70) of experiencing 
a treatment failure at or after 6 weeks on treatment with adalimumab.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016

Overall, the CHMP recognised that the study population was difficult to treat and that the primary 
endpoint is likely very sensitive. Therefore, the effect size, although modest, was considered to be of 
clinical relevance. This position of the CHMP took into account the views expressed by an expert panel, 
which was convened to further discuss the clinical relevance of the observed effect, the duration of 
treatment and possible place in therapy for Humira (see report from the expert meeting below). 
Furthermore, analysis of the time to treatment failure by individual components of the composite 
primary endpoint showed that all components contributed to the treatment failures with the largest 
difference between active and placebo treatment being observed for VH grade. A statistically 
significant difference in favour of adalimumab over placebo was demonstrated for all components (p 
<0.001 to 0.010).  
A numerical favour of adalimumab over placebo was shown in terms of proportion of patients that 
reached quiescence at Week 6 (i.e. still on 15 mg CS/day) and from Week 8 (10 mg CS/day) statistical 
significance was achieved (47 vs. 66% in placebo and adalimumab groups, respectively p=0.013). 
Thus, there was a consistently higher proportion of patients in the adalimumab treatment group 
compared to placebo that remained in quiescence over the course of the study, showing maintenance 
of treatment effect over the course of the study albeit only for a limited subset of patients (maximum 
20% difference between treatment arms).  
Of the 9 ranked secondary analyses, adalimumab was numerically favoured in all, and statistical 
significance was reached in 7 of the analyses, thus supporting robustness of the study results. Some 
questions were raised in relation to data imputation. Due to the large number of treatment failures the 
amount of data imputed using LOCF was very large at the later time points. Even though the large 
amount of missing values at later time-points was mostly due to treatment failure, LOCF is not 
necessarily equal to worst observation carried forward for all endpoints. However, the imputation 
strategy was not expected to change the overall interpretation of data, hence no further investigation 
was considered necessary. 
However, the magnitudes of the mean effect sizes of the secondary endpoints, including AC cell and 
VH grades and visual acuity, are limited. With regards to visual acuity, while it is recognised that some 
of the patients likely already have an irreversible structural damage and keeping in mind that visual 
impairment was mild to moderate at Baseline, the ultimate aim of controlling an uveitis flare is to 
preserve visual function and in this context, the observed mean difference of 3.5 letters (0.07 logMAR, 
p=0.003) between treatment arms in favour of adalimumab was not convincing. The MAH explained 
this finding with the inclusion of both eyes in the endpoint even if only one eye failed as well as with 
the dilution of the effect since a large proportion of the study subjects (63.6% to 85%) did not 
experience a treatment failure (i.e., were responders) with regards to a particular component of the 
primary endpoint. This was acknowledged by the CHMP.  
With regards to BCVA, the proportion of patients who gained ≥ 5 letters or had no relevant changes in 
BCVA (within ±4 letters) was numerically higher in the adalimumab group at each time-point beyond 
Week 6. While the differences between treatment arms were rather small and overall few subjects 
gained visual acuity, it is recognised that many subjects had only mild vision loss at Baseline 
(approximately 20/32) leaving not much room for improvement. With regards to patients experiencing 
a significant loss of BCVA (≥15 letters), inconsistently, at the later time points, adalimumab seemed 
not to be favoured over placebo for the left eye, while the opposite was observed for the right eye. 
However, at Week 80 a total of 3 and 14 eyes gained ≥ 5 letters in BCVA in the placebo and 
adalimumab groups, respectively, while 38 and 24 eyes in the respective groups lost ≥ 15 letters. 
There was furthermore a small, but consistent numerical trend in favour of adalimumab over placebo 
in terms of proportion of patients that gained 10-14, or ≥15 letters in BCVA throughout the study. 
Thus, adalimumab seemed overall favoured. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 64/108 
 
 
 
 
With regards to the VFQ-25 total score as well as near vision and ocular pain, the magnitude of the 
difference between treatment arms was in line with, or beyond what is generally regarded as clinically 
relevant (4-5 units). However, vision-related quality of life seemed to decrease during the study 
(general health was markedly reduced with 8.4 units in the adalimumab group, and even more so in 
the placebo group). This may be explained by the fact that quality of life is evaluated from the best 
state achieved and subjects had not much potential for improvement since the average change in VFQ-
25 score included both deterioration (treatment failures) and no or minimal change in those who did 
not fail. Post hoc analyses indicated that declines in the VFQ-25 total score increased with the number 
of failure components, while in subjects who did not experience treatment failures, the score remained 
at the same level as best state achieved (+0.2). Overall, the PROs (except for HADS) tended to favour 
adalimumab.  
For the other endpoints, adalimumab was generally superior to placebo although the differences 
between treatment arms were generally limited in size.  
• 
Efficacy outcomes - controlled (inactive) uveitis (study M10-880, VISION II). 
Similar to study M10-877, the rate of treatment failures was high in both treatment arms of study 
M10-880 with 55% (61/110) and 39% (45/115) in the adalimumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
The risk of treatment failure for subjects in the adalimumab group was reduced by 43% (95% CI 0.39, 
0.84) compared to subjects in the placebo group. As these were subjects with controlled disease, it 
was expected that the time to treatment failure would be longer than in subjects with active disease. 
This was confirmed with a median time to treatment failure of 8.3 months in the placebo group 
(compared to 3.0 months in the active uveitis study). Time to treatment failure was not estimable (i.e. 
>18 months) for adalimumab subjects because fewer than half of the patients experienced treatment 
failure at the time of conclusion of the study. The outcome was statistically significant (p=0.004).  
No statistically significant differences were observed for the 3 components of the primary endpoint 
directly related to inflammation (active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade and VH cell grade) which is 
also reflected in some of the ranked secondary variables, as discussed below. The treatment effect of 
the primary endpoint was mainly driven by the visual acuity component. However, while statistically in 
favour of the adalimumab group (p=0.002, HR 0.33), only a small proportion of patients actually lost 
15 letters; 23 (20.7%) patients in the placebo arm versus 10 (8.7%) patients in the adalimumab arm, 
and this loss occurred mostly early on in the study (by Week 20). Changes in retinal lesions and/or 
visual acuity in the study population, i.e. patients with uveitis controlled with CS and free of flare for a 
mean of 5 months at Baseline, would however normally be expected to occur gradually and be 
preceded by episodes of active inflammation. Furthermore, even though the risk for treatment failure 
due to worsening of visual acuity by at least 15 letters was clearly reduced in the adalimumab group, 
there was only a 2 letter (logMAR 0.04, p=0.096) mean difference in BCVA change from Baseline 
between treatment arms, further supporting the notion that only a small proportion of patients seemed 
to have benefited from adalimumab treatment. The MAH provided further characteristics of the 33 
subjects with a ≥15 letter loss demonstrating that the vision loss paralleled increases in AC cells, VH 
scores and/or central retinal thickness in all but 2 placebo-treated subjects, although the criteria for 
failure were not reached in all patients. Similarly, in all but one placebo-treated subject with an early 
loss of BCVA (around Week 12 or earlier), this was associated with increases in other inflammatory 
parameters. Some patients also developed cataract, but these few cases were considered unlikely to 
have had an impact on the study outcome. Overall, these data supported an association of the vision 
loss with disease manifestations. As for the small mean difference in BCVA (logMAR 0.04) between 
treatment arms, the MAH explained that this difference was mainly driven by patients/eyes reaching 
treatment failure (23 and 10 subjects for placebo and adalimumab, respectively) and therefore a large

difference may not be expected. This was acknowledged by the CHMP. Still, the results only support a 
modest treatment effect.  
Further support with regards to long-term maintenance treatment could be deducted from the 
preliminary results of the ongoing long-term extension study in which some subjects with controlled 
disease at study entry have been treated for up to 174 weeks (see discussion below). Notably, in the 
subset of patients that entered the extension with controlled (inactive) uveitis, overall only 12.5% 
experienced a flare during the treatment period and, so far, no one discontinued the study due to lack 
of efficacy. Further, in this subset of patients, the mean dose of CS was <2 mg/day (compared to 
approximately 4 mg/day for those entering the study with active uveitis) and the majority of these 
patients were controlled without CS. Thus, there are clear indications of a treatment benefit with long-
term continuous therapy and a potential for a relevant steroid-sparing effect.  
With regards to the ranked secondary endpoint, no statistically significant differences were observed 
between the treatment groups for any of the 9 variables. The results were numerically in favour of 
adalimumab for all ranked variables except for the change in VFQ-25 sub-score near vision where 
essentially no difference was observed between treatment arms. Similar to study M10-877, the effect 
sizes were modest, but some were likely diluted including AC and VH outcomes as few treatment 
failures were due to these components. Overall, it was recognised by the CHMP that the mean AC cell 
scores, VH scores and BCVA were consistently better in the adalimumab group compared to placebo 
over the course of the study although the differences were smaller than in study M10-877. There was 
also a consistently higher number of adalimumab-treated subjects that gained ≥5 letters in BCVA and 
similarly, a consistently lower number of subjects in this treatment group that lost <15 letters. At 
Week 80, a total of 38 and 53 eyes gained ≥5 letters in BCVA in the placebo and adalimumab groups, 
respectively, while 24 and 11 eyes in the respective groups lost ≥ 15 letters. Furthermore, the 
proportion of patients in quiescence without steroids was consistently higher during the course of the 
study, providing further support for adalimumab as a steroid-sparing option. Altogether, and taking 
into account the view expressed by experts in the treatment of uveitis (see summary of ad-hoc expert 
group meeting below), these results were considered by the CHMP to be reassuring and supporting a 
beneficial effect of Humira in maintaining disease control. 
Among the PROs, adalimumab was overall favoured in the VFQ-25 and also in the WPAI-SHP. 
However, with regards to VFQ-25 near vision, in contrast to study M10-877, in study M10-880 
adalimumab was not favoured over placebo. In study M10-880, Baseline scores were markedly higher 
than in M10-877 (score of 75 versus 62), which can be explained as patients in M10-877 represent a 
population with controlled disease and there may not be room for a significant treatment effect in this 
respect. For HADS and EQ-5D, outcomes were similar in the treatment groups. As in study M10-877, 
overall vision-related quality of life decreased during the study, including in the adalimumab-treatment 
arm.  
•  Subgroup analyses including Japanese sub-studies 
Analyses of the primary and ranked secondary endpoints were conducted for both pivotal trials for 
numerous subgroups. Of the more than 50 subgroups analysed, adalimumab was favoured in the vast 
majority of analyses conducted with either study data sets, demonstrating a reasonably consistency of 
the results. Furthermore, none of the subgroup analyses favoured placebo in both studies, which 
provides further reassurance. 
Since the population PK exercise indicated that body weight influenced clearance and exposure, 
additional subgroup analyses by weight have been conducted by the MAH. In these analyses, 
adalimumab was consistently favoured over placebo without any trends towards an inferior effect in 
heavier patients.

Adalimumab was also favoured in most types and diagnoses of uveitis in both studies. In study 
M10 877, adalimumab appeared less effective in intermediate uveitis which may be of concern in view 
of the potentially increased risk of demyelinating disorders in these patients (see also section 2.5. ). 
However, the limited effect was only observed in one of the studies and due to the small sample size, 
no firm conclusions could be drawn from the data. The CHMP agreed to expand SmPC section 4.4 with 
information on the association of immediate uveitis and demyelinating disorders together with a 
recommendation to conduct a neurological evaluation (see section 2.5.4. for details).  
With regards to gender, a limited effect in females was observed in both studies with only 1 month 
difference in the median time to treatment failure between treatment arms. Although the duration of 
uveitis was longer in female patients compared to males, there was no significant interaction between 
treatment and gender when adjusting for the duration of the disease. In study M10-880, there were 
some imbalances between genders with regards to location of the inflammation (intermediate and 
panuveitis) and diagnosis (VKH and Behçet’s disease). Substantially more women than men (46 vs. 5) 
were affected with VKH, while the opposite was observed for Behçet's disease (13 males and 3 
females). The separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with VKH was clearly less prominent 
compared to the subset with Behçet's disease. It could be speculated if the efficacy of Humira is lower 
in subjects with VKC, but the number of subjects concerned was too low to draw firm conclusions. The 
MAH also presented data from the extension study separated by gender. The available data indicated 
that there were no major differences between men and women with regards to inflammation and CS 
usage, thereby providing support of a relevant effect of Humira in both genders and thus some 
reassurance. It was also acknowledged by the CHMP that the studies were not powered to assess 
effects in subgroups. 
With regards to antibody formation, the number of anti-adalimumab antibody positive (AAA+) subjects 
was too small with 4 patients in study M10-877 and 8 patients in study M10-880 to conclude on any 
impact on efficacy. Further data presented by the MAH showed that AAA development remained low 
regardless of concomitant IMM therapy (2.2%, 2/91) or not (6.3%, 10/158). However, the data were 
too limited to draw any conclusions whether the absence of a protective umbrella of prednisolone and 
immunosuppressive therapy would affect antibody formation. Overall, the CHMP was of the view that 
the current information in the SmPC about immunogenicity was sufficient. 
With regards to the Japanese sub-studies, notably, adalimumab was not favoured in patients with 
active uveitis with median times to treatment failures of 2.8 and 2.4 months in the placebo and 
adalimumab group, respectively (HR=1.2). However, the number of study subjects was very limited 
(16 and 32 subjects enrolled in the sub-studies of M10-877 and M10-880, respectively), and the 
number of patients with active uveitis may have been too small to determine the true effect size. No 
further information in this regards was considered necessary by the CHMP. In inactive uveitis, the risk 
for failure was reduced (HR=0.55) for the adalimumab group, but there was less than a month 
difference between treatment arms with regards to time to treatment failure. However, even though 
the effect size was limited, there was at least a trend towards a benefit of adalimumab, which is 
consistent with the main study results. 
• 
Long-term data (open label extension study M11-327, VISION III) 
The overall duration of study drug exposure was rather short in the two pivotal phase 3 trials, in 
particular in study M10-877 in which subjects were treated for a mean of 5 and 7 months in the 
placebo and adalimumab treatment groups, respectively. In the extension study (M11-327), the mean 
and median durations of exposure to adalimumab for the All Adalimumab Analysis Set (n=464) was 81 
and 68 weeks, respectively. The study is ongoing and preliminary data have been provided. At the cut-
off date, 335 subjects had been treated with adalimumab for >48 weeks and 38 subjects for >192 
weeks.

Although acknowledged that a large proportion of patients from the main studies entered the extension 
study (423/452), there are limitations resulting from the uncontrolled, open-label design of the study 
and the fact that a fairly large proportion discontinued the study. Despite these caveats, the 
preliminary efficacy data seem promising with low proportions of patients with increases in AC cells or 
VH grades and thus apparently being well controlled.  
Of the 243 subjects with active disease entering the extension, 132 (54.3%) experienced treatment 
failures, which was a relatively high proportion of patients. However, for the majority, the flare was 
followed by a period of disease control and the median time to treatment failure was 12.5 months and 
notably longer than in the core studies. Also, the subjects who failed on adalimumab in the core 
studies, i.e. a potentially even more difficult to treat population, seemed to benefit from continued 
treatment with a median time to treatment failure of 9.7 months. Few patients with controlled uveitis 
at study entry experienced treatment failures (12.5%) and the time to treatment failure could not be 
estimated. Although these results were promising, due to the uncontrolled nature of the study, it was 
not possible to conclude to what extent adalimumab contributed to the large proportion of patients in 
quiescence. To further explore this issue, the MAH provided additional analyses for the 83 patients 
entering the extension from study M10-880. Amongst these patients, 39 and 44 subjects had 
experienced <2 and ≥2 flares, respectively, in the 12 months prior to enrolling in M10-880. The rate of 
treatment failures was higher in the subgroup with ≥2 flares (13.6% vs 5.1%), but was still fairly low. 
While recognizing the limited number of subjects and that concomitant treatment may well have 
influenced these outcomes, use of CS was low and the analyses provided reassurance of a relevant 
effect of Humira. 
Overall, vision remained essentially the same in patients with controlled disease at study entry. For 
patients with active disease, there were trends towards an improvement in BCVA with improved 
disease control. These results were independent of concomitant use of IMM or when stratified for 
previous treatment (placebo/adalimumab). There was no indication of deterioration of BCVA with time.  
Based on these results, patients seemed better controlled than in the main studies, but this may have 
been due to the option to receive concomitant CS at the Investigator’s discretion. It was however 
reassuring that the subjects entering the extension study with controlled disease generally maintained 
a low daily CS dose over time (< 2 mg) while subjects with a flare at study start had a reduction in 
daily dose of CS from approximately 14 mg at study entry to approximately 4 mg after 1 year. Overall, 
the majority of subjects with controlled uveitis at study entry did not receive concomitant CSs. 
Taken together, the extension study supports a benefit of Humira in the long-term, in subjects with 
active and controlled disease as well as a relevant steroid sparing effect.  
Indication and posology recommendations 
In the EU, CS and ciclosporin are the only compounds formally approved for the treatment of uveitis. 
With regards to ciclosporin, in clinical practice, other IMMs, for example, MTX, MMF or azathioprine are 
often the preferred standard of care. TNF-inhibitors are generally used as later line options.  
Subjects included in study M10-877 were representative of a target population insufficiently responsive 
to steroids and 31% of subjects were on one additional IMM. In study M10-880, all subjects received 
steroids and half were controlled with IMMs. Thus, Humira was studied in patients already receiving 
conventional therapy and consequently, the initially proposed first line indication was not agreed by 
the CHMP. Instead, use in patients with inadequate response to CS, in need for CS-sparing or in whom 
CS are inappropriate, was considered adequate. Use in patients with inadequate response to CS was in 
line with the study population of the pivotal trials which demonstrated a clinically relevant treatment 
effect of Humira as well as a CS sparing effect, which was further supported by the ongoing extension 
study. While patients in which CS are inappropriate were not recruited in the clinical development

EMA/501143/2016  
Page 68/108 
 
 
 
 
program, there was no reason to believe that the efficacy or safety profile should be significantly 
different in such population. It was thus considered appropriate to include this subset of the population 
as part of the indication. The decision to limit use of Humira to second-line therapy also took into 
account its safety profile as use of Humira is not without risks (see section 2.5. ). 
With regards to IMM use, subgroup analyses for patients without concomitant use of IMM were 
consistently in favour of adalimumab (HR 0.49, p<0.001 for study M10-877 and HR 0.64, p=0.068 for 
study M10-880). Therefore, and taking into account the relatively large proportion of patients without 
concomitant IMMs (about 70% and 50 % in studies M10-877 and M10-880, respectively), and the fact 
that other than ciclosporin, IMMs were not approved for the treatment of uveitis at the time of this 
report, the CHMP agreed that limitation to last line treatment option was not needed. This position and 
the proposed indication was supported by the expert panel (see below). 
The CHMP furthermore noted that the protocol pre-specified use of CS at the start of study M10-877 
did not fully treatment initiation of Humira as monotherapy in active uveitis. In fact, the available 
limited data indicated a lower response rate if treatment was initiated with Humira alone; in the 
extension study, amongst the 25 patients with active uveitis at study entry and receiving adalimumab 
as monotherapy, only 13 (52%) patients achieved quiescence at Week 8. It is thus not known whether 
disease control with Humira alone would be obtained as rapidly as in combination with CS. Therefore, 
the CHMP was of the view that treatment with Humira should be initiated in combination with CS 
and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. Once disease control has been achieved, 
Humira could continue in monotherapy. The CHMP agreed that the physician should determine the CS 
tapering schedule whereby the risk of CS-associated AEs should be balanced against the risk of flare-
up. To ensure that the exposure of adalimumab has reached steady state, it was recommended that 
CS taper be started no earlier than 2 week after treatment initiation with Humira. 
As previously discussed, the CHMP considered that there was sufficient support for a beneficial effect of 
Humira in the maintenance treatment of uveitis patients. Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that 
continuation of treatment should be re-evaluated by physicians on an annual basis taking into account 
the benefits and risks of long-term treatment.  
Additional expert consultation 
During the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified the need for expert input and thus an ad-hoc 
expert meeting was convened to address the following questions: 
Question 1.  
In  the  study  including  patients  with  non-infectious  active  uveitis  (patients  insufficiently  controlled  on 
≥10 but ≤60 mg prednisolone/day), there was a statistically significant difference in time to treatment 
failure  between  Humira  and  placebo  (5.6  versus  3  months).  All  components  of  the  primary  endpoint 
contributed to the results.  
Please discuss the clinical relevance of this effect, as well as a possible corticosteroid sparing effect. 
There  was  a  general  view  amongst  the  experts  that,  based  on  the  totality  of  the  available  data,  a 
clinically relevant beneficial effect of Humira had been shown in the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. 
The  observed  effect  size  was  considered  modest.  However  at  the  same  time,  the  composite  primary 
endpoint,  comprising  new  active  lesions,  anterior  chamber  cells,  vitreous  haze  and  visual  acuity  as 
criteria for treatment failure, was rather stringent and hard to meet, in particular considering the study 
population including difficult to treat patients. In that sense, the observed effect was considered more 
relevant.  Other  study  outcomes,  including  the  steroid  sparing  effect,  were  considered  relevant, 
although  it  was  noted  that  the  corticosteroid  tapering  regimen  in  the  study  was  rather  aggressive. 
Further  data  may  become  available  from  the  open-label  extension  study  VISUAL  III,  in  which  the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 69/108 
 
 
 
 
conditions  are  closer  to  actual  clinical  practice.  Finally,  the  experts  highlighted  the  importance  of  the 
short time until onset of action of Humira, as rapid control of the inflammation is key in the treatment 
of active uveitis.  
Questions were however raised if the proposed dosing regimen (80mg loading dose followed by 40mg 
every  other  week)  was  suboptimal  and  if  better  result  could  be  achieved  with  a  higher  dose  and/or 
dosing frequency. It was not considered self-evident that TNF-α inhibitors could be used for treatment 
of uveitis in the same way as for rheumatic disorders.  
During  the  discussion,  the  occurrence  of  demyelinating  events  in  patients  receiving  Humira  was 
considered  of  concern  and  some  experts  stated  that  they  would  not  use  Humira  in  patients  with 
demyelinating  disease  or  signs  of  development  of  such  disease  including  multiple  sclerosis. 
Furthermore, it was stated that in clinical practice Humira is used together with immunosuppressants 
such as methotrexate. Concomitant use of immunosuppressants may be required to reduce the risk of 
development of anti-adalimumab antibodies.  
Finally, while an obvious aim in uveitis therapy is the prevention/reduction of recurrences, the experts 
also highlighted that a reduction of the severity of the disease and of any recurrence was of relevance. 
In this context it would be interesting to explore if in the clinical studies, uveitis flares were milder in 
patients treated with Humira compared to placebo. 
Question 2.  
In  the  study  examining  patients  with  inactive  uveitis,  there  was  also  a  statistically  significant  effect 
favouring  Humira  over  placebo  with  respect  to  time  to  treatment  failure.  However,  in  this  study  the 
effect  was  driven  only  by  a  difference  in  visual  acuity  while  no  statistical  significant  difference  was 
observed for other components of the primary endpoint or for the ranked secondary endpoints. 
a.  Please discuss the clinical relevance and plausibility of these results based on current knowledge 
with  respect  to  the  extent  and  temporal  pattern  of  loss  of  visual  acuity  in  patients  with  non-
infectious inactive uveitis.  
b.  Taking the results into account as well as current clinical praxis, please discuss adequate duration 
of treatment in patients with inactive uveitis. 
With regards to the demonstration of a treatment effect for Humira, the experts considered the totality 
of  the  available  data  from  the  clinical  development  program  and  their  experience  with  Humira  in 
clinical practice. Based on this, the experts considered that a clinically relevant effect for Humira had 
been  robustly  demonstrated.  With  regards  to  the  study  in  patients  with  inactive  uveitis  (VISUAL  II), 
analyses  of  the  course  of  the  disease  for  individual  patients,  who  experienced  treatment  failure 
because  of  loss  of  vision  (loss  of  best  corrected  visual  acuity  ≥  15  letters)  showed  a  correlation  with 
the  worsening  of  the  other components  of  the  composite  primary  endpoint  in  the  majority  of  cases. 
The  secondary  study  endpoints  furthermore  did  not  account  for  time  and  the  delay  in  disease 
progression/vision  loss  observed  with  Humira  compared  to  placebo.  One  expert  suggested  that 
occurrence  of  cystoid  macular  oedema  could  theoretically  explain  the  observed  loss  in  vision  as  main 
driver of treatment failure, but this was not supported by the data.  
It  was  also  pointed  out  that  the  study  population  was  representative  of  patients  with  less  severe 
disease,  reflecting  broader  clinical  practice.  The  clinical  relevance  of  a  treatment  option  with  rapid 
onset of action to prevent visual threatening sequelae was reiterated and one expert stated that in his 
experience, Humira also improves quality of life of patients seeing that subcutaneous injections can be 
self-administered, i.e. at home rather than requiring presentation in a ward.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 70/108 
 
 
 
 
With regards to treatment duration, the experts agreed that there was a need for regular check-ups of 
the  patients  and  that  re-evaluation  of  treatment  continuation  on  a  yearly  basis  was  reasonable.  As 
uveitis is a chronic disease, long-term treatment may be needed, possibly life-long. In this context, the 
experience  with  Humira  in  the  treatment  of  arthritis  and  other  rheumatic  and  inflammatory  diseases 
was considered reassuring with regards to the safety of its long-term use. 
Question 3.  
The proposed indication for Humira (treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis 
in  adult  patients)  could  be  interpreted  as  including  treatment  both  as  monotherapy  and  combination 
therapy as well as all patients with all types of uveitis (e.g. acute, recurrent, chronic). Please discuss 
the potential, adequate place in therapy for Humira, taking into consideration current standard of care, 
the characteristics of patients included in the pivotal clinical trials as well as the results of these trials. 
The experts agreed with the revised proposal for the indication by the company as further amended by 
the Rapporteurs limiting the use of Humira to uveitis patients who have had an inadequate response to 
corticosteroids, in need of corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. 
The  majority  of  the  experts  saw  Humira  as  a  second  or  third  line  treatment  option  after  use  of 
corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.  
At  the  same  time  a  trend  was  noticed,  whereby  biologics  are  increasingly  used  earlier  in  therapy  as 
more experience is gained in their use and safety profiles. In clinical practice, there is a need to tailor 
treatment  to  individual  patients  and  some  experts  would  even  considered  Humira  for  very  severe 
diseases (e.g. Behçet disease) as first line treatment option.  
Finally,  as  previously  discussed,  it  was  noted  that  Humira  should  not  be  used  in  patients  with 
developing or pre-existing demyelinating disease and that concomitant use of immunosuppressants is 
preferred to reduce the risk of development of anti-adalimumab antibodies. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the data presented in support of this application, the CHMP was of the view that a modest, 
but  clinical  relevant  effect  of  Humira  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  non-infectious 
intermediate,  posterior  and  pan-uveitis  had  been  robustly  demonstrated.  Taking  into  account  the 
conditions  under  which  Humira  has  been  studied,  as  well  as  current  clinical  practice  and  the  views 
expressed by an ad-hoc expert group, the CHMP was however of the view that use of Humira should 
be restricted to patients with inadequate response to corticosteroids, in need of corticosteroid-sparing, 
or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate.  
Taken together, the CHMP concluded that the available clinical efficacy data were adequate to support 
this application subject to s limitations in use as discussed above. As the proposed dose regimen might 
not  be  sufficient  to  achieve  maximum  efficacy,  the  CHMP  recommended  that  a  weekly  40 mg  dosing 
regimen should be further explored post-approval by the MAH.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The adalimumab clinical development program in uveitis includes 2 pivotal, randomized, double-
masked, placebo-controlled studies (studies M10-877 and M10-880) and 1 open-label extension study 
(study M11-327). In addition, separate sub-studies in Japanese patients were conducted for studies 
M10-877 and M10-880. For a more detailed description of the study design and methods, see section 
2.4.2. and 2.4.3.  
Safety analyses were performed within each study and integrated across studies. Safety was assessed 
by adverse events (AEs) including AEs of special interest (AESIs), physical examination, vital signs, 
and laboratory data.  
The following analysis sets were used for the safety analysis:  
• 
• 
The Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of randomized 
double-masked adalimumab (N = 250) or placebo (N = 250) in study M10-877 or study M10-
880. This set was meant to allow for an assessment of the short- term safety profile for 
adalimumab, with focus on the comparison between the adalimumab versus placebo group. 
The All Adalimumab Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab 
(double masked or open label) in studies M10-877, M10-880 or M11-327. This set was meant 
to allow for an assessment of long-term safety profile for adalimumab, from first dose through 
last available observation. 
All AE summaries/analyses include treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) only. A TEAE was defined as: 
• 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set: Any event with onset or worsening at or after the first dosing 
date, and 
o  before first application of open-label study drug in the extension study or up to 70 days 
after the last double-masked study drug injection (whatever is the earliest) for 
subjects who rolled over into the open-label extension study, or 
o  up to 70 days after the last double-masked study drug injection for subjects who did 
not roll over in the open label extension study. 
•  All Adalimumab Analysis Set: Any event with onset or worsening at or after the first dose of 
adalimumab treatment and up to 70 days (equivalent to 5 half-lives of adalimumab) after the 
last study drug injection or until the data cut-off date in Study M11-327, whatever is the 
earliest. 
For each AE category presented, a comparison between treatment groups of the percentage of 
subjects experiencing at least one such AE was performed using Fisher's exact test. Only p values ≤ 
0.100 when rounded to three digits were presented. 
The safety assessment also took into account that the AE profile of Humira has already been 
extensively characterised in previous development programmes and post-marketing: The most 
commonly reported adverse reactions of Humira are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain 
or swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. Serious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, 
mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or other opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 72/108 
 
 
 
 
legionellosis and pneumocystis have also been reported in patients receiving Humira. In addition, 
serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have been reported. These include 
rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events and 
reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Finally, in the controlled 
portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including lymphoma have 
been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, 
the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in 
patients treated with a TNF-antagonist.  
2.5.2.  Patient exposure 
Patient exposure is summarised by analysis set in the below two tables. 
Table 31 - Extent of Exposure (Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set) 
Mean duration of study drug exposure was longer for subjects in the adalimumab group versus the 
placebo group in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. The majority of the subjects were treated up to 
32 weeks (147 subjects, 58.8%). More subjects in the adalimumab group were treated longer than 
561 days (33 patients) than those in the placebo group (13 patients). The shorter duration of exposure 
in the placebo group can be attributed to the fact that more subjects in the placebo group experienced 
treatment failures earlier during the studies, leading to earlier treatment discontinuation. Treatment 
compliance was higher than 90% in the adalimumab and placebo groups.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 73/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 32 - Extent of Exposure (All Adalimumab Analysis set) 
In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, mean duration of exposure to adalimumab was 81.1 weeks. A 
total of 384 subjects were treated with adalimumab for > 24 weeks, 302 subjects for > 48 weeks, and 
24 subjects (5.2%) for > 192 weeks. Cumulative treatment exposure in the All Adalimumab Analysis 
Set was 721.4 patient-years (PY). In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, median treatment compliance 
was approximately 97%.  
As of 30 April 2015, 299 patients who completed the initial studies (M10-877 and M10-880) are 
ongoing in Study M11-327. The proportion of subjects in the placebo-controlled studies that rolled over 
to the open-label study was 84.5%. 
Subject disposition in the Placebo-Controlled and All Adalimumab Analysis Sets are shown in Table 33. 
Table 33 - Subject Disposition 
TEAE = Treatment-emergent adverse event 
Four subjects who discontinued due to treatment failure also had an AE leading to discontinuation. These 4 subjects 
(2 adalimumab and 2 placebo) were considered completers and were not counted under premature discontinuation 
due to the TEAE category presented in this table. 
Notes: Subjects who discontinued were counted under each reason given for discontinuation; therefore, the sum of 
the counts given for the reasons may be greater than the overall number of discontinuations. Subjects who did not 
prematurely discontinue include: 1) subjects who discontinued due to treatment failure, 2) subjects who completed 
Week 80 without treatment failure, and 3) subjects who had to terminate the study because the planned number of 
treatment failures was reached.

•  Demographic Characteristics 
The baseline demographics and main diagnostic and disease characteristics for the two pivotal phase 3 
trials are summarised in Table 10 and Table 11. The majority of subjects treated with adalimumab 
were female (59.4%) and white, with a mean age of 43 years.  
Approximately half of all subjects in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set were diagnosed with 
panuveitis, while approximately 30% were diagnosed with posterior uveitis and approximately 20% 
with intermediate uveitis. No statistically significant differences were observed between adalimumab 
and placebo treatment groups with regards to Baseline demographics or disease characteristics. The 
study population included 52.8% subjects with isolated uveitis (idiopathic, Birdshot choriodopathy, and 
multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis) and 38.2% of patients with uveitis associated with systemic 
manifestations (VKH, Behçet's disease and sarcoidosis). 
In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, eye disease/disorder (50.2%), hypertension (25.6%) and 
hyperlipidemia (12.5%) were the most commonly reported conditions/diagnoses during medical history 
data collection. A small percentage of All Adalimumab Analysis Set had a medical history of diabetes 
mellitus (5.2%), osteoarthritis (6.0%) and osteoporosis (5.4%). 
Previous and concomitant medication is summarised in section 2.4.2.2.  
2.5.3.  Adverse events (AEs) 
An overview of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the uveitis clinical 
development program is provided in Table below. A TEAE was defined as any adverse event with onset 
or worsening at or after the first dosing date.

Adalimumab Analysis Sets) 
a. P value for comparisons between placebo and adalimumab using Fisher's exact test. Only P values ≤ 0.100 are 
presented. 
b. As assessed by the investigator. 
c. Two subjects died during the placebo-controlled double-masked studies due to TEAEs. One additional subject 
included in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set died due to a TEAE experienced in Study M11-327. For clarity, this 
additional death was not presented for the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set in the table above. 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 80% and 87% of subjects in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis 
Set receiving placebo and adalimumab, respectively, experienced ≥1 TEAE. In the All Adalimumab 
Analysis Set, approximately 90% experienced ≥1 TEAE. There was an increase in the reporting of any 
TEAE possibly related drug, any SAE and any TEAE leading to discontinuation in adalimumab treated 
subjects in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set with exposure time.  
Common AEs  
An overview of the most common TEAEs reported by at least 2% of the subjects in either treatment 
group is provided in Table 34.  
The most common TEAEs with an incidence >10% were nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, headache and 
fatigue in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. There was a higher incidence of nasopharyngitis (17.6% 
versus 12.4%), arthralgia (15.2% versus 10.0%) and fatigue (10.4% versus 6.8%) in the adalimumab 
group compared to placebo. There was a statistically significant (p<0.05) higher frequency for 
adalimumab-treated patients compared to placebo for anxiety (4.4% vs 0.8%), paraesthesia (4.0% vs 
0.4%), and rash pustular (2.4% vs 0%). Pustular rash was reported by 6 subjects (2.4%) in the 
adalimumab group compared to none in the placebo group in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Serious adverse events 
There were only few serious TEAE and the majority were reported in single subjects in the Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Set. In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, more subjects in the adalimumab 
group reported serious TEAEs (25/250, 10%) compared to placebo (16/250, 6.4%). In the All 
Adalimumab Analysis Set, serious TEAEs reported by 2 or more subjects included: uveitis (6 subjects, 
1.3%), pneumonia (5 subjects, 1.1%), cataract (4 subjects, 0.9%), and urinary tract infection and 
obesity (3 subjects each, 0.6%). Furthermore, demyelination, tuberculosis, basal cell carcinoma,

retinal detachment, visual acuity reduced, and vitreous haemorrhage were each reported by 2 subjects 
(0.4%) in the All Adalimumab Analysis Set. 
•  Deaths 
Three subjects died in the uveitis clinical development program. None of the events were considered 
related to adalimumab by the investigator. 
•  Other significant events 
Other significant TEAEs include those leading to discontinuation of study drug (see dedicated section 
below) and those of special interest. 
The TEAS of special interest for the uveitis clinical development program defined by the Applicant were 
•  Non-ocular events: infections, malignancies, immunological reactions, demyelinating disorders, 
haematological events including pancytopenia, hepatological events, and injection site 
reactions; 
•  Ocular events: uveitis related events, intraocular pressure (IOP) increased, and lens opacity.   
Non ocular events 
Infections 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, significantly more subjects in the adalimumab group reported 
infection TEAEs versus placebo (p = 0.004) for a total of 48.8% and 35.6% of subjects in the 
adalimumab and placebo groups, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of subjects with any 
infection TEAE were similar for the adalimumab and placebo groups (146.9 and 143.6 events (E)/100 
patient years [PYs], respectively, see Table 35). 
The most frequently reported TEAE (>10%) were nasopharyngitis (24.6%), and urinary tract infection 
(10.8%) in the All Adalimumab Analysis Set.  
Serious infections were reported in 7 subjects (2.8% and 4.8 E/100 PYs) in the adalimumab group and 
in 4 subjects (1.6% and 4.2 E/100 PYs) in the placebo group in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. In 
the All Adalimumab Analysis Set 27 subjects reported serious infections (5.8% and 4.6 E/100PY). 
There were no cases of opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis) reported in the Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Set. In the All Adalimumab Set, 2 cases (0.4%, 0.3 E/100PYs) were reported. 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, there were 5 cases of treatment-emergent tuberculosis in the 
adalimumab group (2.0%, 3.0E/100PYs) including 1 case of active tuberculosis and 4 cases of latent 
tuberculosis. In the placebo group, there was 1 case of latent tuberculosis. In the All Adalimumab 
Analysis Set, 2 subjects treated with adalimumab reported treatment-emergent active tuberculosis 
(0.3 E/100 PYs) and 17 subjects reported treatment-emergent latent tuberculosis. Of the 17 subjects 
with latent tuberculosis, 12 subjects reported mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive and 4 
subjects reported tuberculin test positive.  
In the uveitis clinical development program, initially, subjects with latent tuberculosis were allowed to 
enrol. Subsequently the protocols were amended to exclude subjects with previous and latent 
tuberculosis (as well as active tuberculosis) to avoid potential confounding effects of tuberculosis 
prophylactic medications. Thus, the number of tuberculosis conversions reported was higher compared 
to previous clinical studies for other indications.

Malignancies 
In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, 12 subjects reported malignancies in the uveitis clinical 
development program. Four events were reported in 4 adalimumab subjects during the double-masked 
studies. The remaining 8 events were reported during the open-label extension study, whereby 5 of 
those subjects were initially assigned to receive placebo during the double-masked studies. In the All 
Adalimumab Analysis Set, the rates of all malignancies, lymphoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC) were 1.7, 0.1 and 0.7 events/100 PYs.

Demyelinating disorders 
A total of 6 subjects who received adalimumab reported events of demyelinating disorders or optic 
neuritis (ON) in the uveitis clinical development program. Among the 6 cases, 4 cases were reported 
as events of demyelination or multiple sclerosis (MS) and 2 events were reported as ON.

Table 39 - Treatment-Emergent Demyelinating Disorders by MedDRA PT (Placebo-
Controlled and All Adalimumab Analysis Sets) 
In the 2 cases of ON, the MRI did not show any lesions in the brain suggestive of central demyelinating 
disorders. Furthermore, in 1 of the 2 cases of ON, the TEAE occurred in a subject with Behçet-
associated uveitis at Baseline and was reported as papillitis, which codes to the preferred term of ON. 
The MRI was normal and ruled out lesions suggestive of a demyelinating disease. Thus, the ON in this 
case likely was inflammation in the optic nerve associated with Behçet's disease. In the second ON 
case, no MRI or clinical findings of brain demyelination were noted with >2 years of follow-up.  
The total exposure of the All Adalimumab Analysis Set was notably higher than the placebo group of 
the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set (721.43 versus 119.76 PYs). The exposure adjusted incidence 
rates and the 95% CI for the placebo group of the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set and the All 
Adalimumab Analysis Set were 0 (0.00 – 3.08) E/100 PYs and 0.83 (0.31 – 1.81) E/100 PYs, 
respectively, indicating widely overlapping confidence intervals (CIs). 
The association between demyelinating disorders and uveitis, particularly in cohorts of patients with 
intermediate uveitis, has been described in the scientific literature. In patients with intermediate 
uveitis, estimated incidence of multiple sclerosis ranges from 1.5 – 3.4 E/100 PYs and estimated 
incidence of optic neuritis ranges from 0.5 – 1.0 E/100 PYs in the published literature (Malinowski et 
al., 1993; Raja et al., 1999; Prieto et al., 2001). Furthermore, an epidemiological study (study 
P150002) was conducted by the applicant using Truven Health MarketScan® claims database. The 
study utilized data from 2000 to 2014 with a total of 103,877 subjects enrolled. The data from the 
MarketScan® claims database study are consistent with the published literature in showing the highest 
incidence rate of demyelination/multiple sclerosis in the intermediate uveitis subtype. The results from 
the data analysis are presented in Table 39 below. For comparison, incidence rates based on the data 
from the uveitis clinical trial program are provided in Table 40.

In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 4 adalimumab subjects and 1 placebo subject reported 
treatment-emergent haematologic events. In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, 12 subjects reported 
hematologic events. None of the events were severe. 
Hepatological Events 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 2 adalimumab subjects and 1 placebo subject reported 
treatment-emergent hepatologic events. In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, 5 subjects treated with 
adalimumab reported hepatologic events. All events were considered non serious.  
Injection Site Reactions  
A total of 12.4% and 8.8% of subjects in the adalimumab and placebo groups, respectively 
(representing 39.3 and 19.2 events/100 PYs, respectively), reported treatment-emergent injection site 
reactions (see Table 41).

sarcoidosis. Studies have shown that uveitis in patients with systemic sarcoidosis is common and the 
development of uveitis may precede the systemic symptoms and diagnosis of sarcoidosis for many 
years (Baughman et al., 2010 and Rizzato et al., 1996). Five of the events were considered to be 
worsening or aggravation of pre-existing underlying sarcoidosis. 
Ocular events 
Uveitis Related Adverse Events 
In order to identify uveitis related AEs, the study results were adjudicated by a masked study 
designated physician to be either related or not related to uveitis before unmasking the study. An 
overview of the results is presented in Table 42. 
Table 43 - Treatment-Emergent Uveitis-Related Adverse Events by AbbVie 
Adjudication Reported in ≥ 2 Subjects in Either Treatment Group in the Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Set by MedDRA PT (Placebo-Controlled and All Adalimumab 
Analysis Sets) 
a. P = 0.099. 
Note: P value for comparisons between placebo and active using Fisher's exact test. Only P values ≤ 0.100 are 
presented. 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 24.0% and 20.8% of subjects (representing 49.6 and 65.1 
events/100 PYs) in the adalimumab and placebo groups, respectively, reported uveitis-related TEAEs 
per adjudication. A significantly higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group experienced 
eye pain compared to those in the placebo group (p = 0.099). 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) increased 
AEs associated with increased IOP were observed in 9 subjects (3.6%) in the adalimumab group and 
4 subjects (1.6%) in the placebo group. All of these events were mild or moderate in severity. None of 
the events were considered to be related to adalimumab or placebo; the majority (5/9 in the 
adalimumab group and 3/4 in the placebo group) were possibly or probably related to prednisone. One 
subject reported a SAE of IOP increased. In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, AEs of increased IOP 
were reported by 22 subjects (4.7%). 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, shifts towards increased IOP were observed generally with a 
similar incidence in both treatment groups. Increases in IOP in the worse eye from Baseline 
(0 - ≤ 30 mmHg) to > 30 mmHg were observed in 5 subjects in the adalimumab group and 3 subjects

in the placebo group. Increases in IOP in the better eye from Baseline (0 – ≤ 30 mmHg) to 
> 30 mmHg were observed in 1 subject in the adalimumab group and 2 subjects in the placebo group. 
Lens opacity 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 3 subjects in the adalimumab treatment group experienced a 
2-step increase from Baseline to maximum in lens opacity in at least 1 eye in at least 1 of the 3 
opacity variables (nuclear lens opacity grade, cortical lens opacity grade, posterior subcapsular lens 
opacity grade; no placebo subjects experienced a 2-step increase in lens opacity. 
Laboratory findings 
A greater percentage of adalimumab subjects experienced shifts in neutrophils from normal or high at 
Baseline to low at final visit (4.0% versus 0.4%). 
There were small shifts from Baseline to maximum values observed in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis 
Set as well as in the All Adalimumab Analysis set in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase/alanine 
aminotransferase and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase. Alanine 
aminotransferase elevations ≥ 3 x upper normal limit occurred in 2.4% of Humira-treated patients and 
2.4% of control-treated patients. 
Safety in special populations 
• 
Intrinsic factors 
The number and percentage of TEAEs, overall, by primary MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC), and by 
Preferred Term (PT) were assessed by the subgroups of sex, age, race, type of uveitis, and evidence of 
macular oedema. Relevant findings are summarised below. 
Sub-group analyses were performed based on the age categories < 30 years of age; ≥30 to 
<50 years; and subjects ≥ 50 years. No clinically meaningful differences were observed when 
comparing subgroups in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. The results in elderly are summarised 
below. 
Among all race categories, a greater proportion of white subjects versus Asian and black subjects 
reported TEAEs of eye pain (8.1% versus 0 and 0), fatigue (13.0% versus 3.2% and 0), headache 
(11.9% versus 3.2% and 5.9%). 
When analysing TEAEs by uveitis category, in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the adalimimab 
group showed a greater percentage of subjects with posterior uveitis and intermediate uveitis versus 
subjects with panuveitis who reported overall TEAEs (92.4% and 90.5% versus 82.7%) and any TEAE 
at least possibly related to adalimumab (55.7% and 52.4% versus 35.4%). There was also a 
statistically significant interaction observed for uveitis-related TEAEs by investigator (p = 0.024). In 
the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, a total of 6 subjects were reported with events of demyelinating 
disease including 3 patients with MS (n = 1) or ON (n = 2). The relation to the underlying type of 
uveitis has been previously discussed. See also Table 39 and Table 40. 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, a greater percentage of subjects without evidence of macular 
oedema versus subjects with evidence of macular oedema in the adalimumab group reported severe 
TEAEs (12.4% versus 5.9%), SAEs (12.4% versus 4.4%), SAEs possibly related to study drug (5.1% 
versus 0), and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug (11.2% versus 4.4%). Furthermore, a 
higher proportion of subjects without evidence of macular oedema versus subjects with evidence of 
macular oedema in the adalimumab group reported infection TEAEs (53.9% versus 35.3%) and serious 
infection TEAEs (3.9% versus 0). Among subjects in the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, a greater 
percentage of subjects without evidence of macular oedema versus subjects with evidence of macular

oedema reported TEAEs possibly related to study drug (54.8% versus 45.8%). A smaller percentage of 
subjects without evidence of macular oedema versus subjects with evidence of macular oedema 
reported uveitis-related TEAEs by adjudication (38.9% versus 51.7%).  
• 
Extrinsic factors 
The number and percentage of TEAEs, overall, by primary SOC, and by PT were assessed by the 
subgroups of region, Baseline concomitant medications (IMMs, azathioprine, ciclosporin, MTX, MMF or 
equivalent, tacrolimus, Baseline oral prednisone use, prednisone dose at last flare, and systemic CS 
use once the mandatory prednisone taper was completed).  
Although there were a few statistically significant differences, no clinically meaningful differences were 
observed when comparing subgroups in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. Statistically significant 
interactions were observed for the following subgroups:  
-  Baseline MMF (or equivalent drug) use: prednisone-related TEAEs (p = 0.019) 
-  Baseline oral prednisone use: allergic reactions (p = 0.048) 
-  Prednisone dose at last flare: uveitis-related TEAEs by adjudication (p = 0.003) and infection TEAEs 
(p = 0.006) 
Safety parameters were further compared by dose of concomitant CS (dosing intervals of 0 mg, 0≤15 
mg, and >15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent). Generally the reporting rate was comparable, 
however an increased reporting of infections was found in subjects treated with 0 mg or <15 mg CS 
compared to >15 mg CS. When taking exposure into consideration, a general increase in reporting of 
TEAEs was observed in the group >15 mg CS. With regards to IMMs, a breakdown in the individual 
IMMs was not meaningful, but the incidence of AEs was compared for patients with and without 
concomitant IMMs. Generally the reporting rate was comparable, however the patient years of 
exposure was low. 
• 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Three positive pregnancy test results or events of pregnancy were reported in the uveitis clinical 
development program. The outcome of the 3 pregnancy reports included 1 subject each with 
pregnancy termination, ectopic pregnancy, or continuation of study drug due to false positive test 
results.

In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, a lower percentage of subjects who were ≥65 years versus 
<40 years and 40 – <65 years reported infections (27.3% versus 54.5% and 48.1%). Furthermore, a 
greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group who were <40 years versus 40 – <65 years 
and ≥65 years reported TEAEs of uveitis (11.1% versus 6.2% and 4.5%) and nasopharyngitis (27.3% 
versus 13.2% and 0). A greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group who were 40 – <65 
years versus <40 years and ≥65 years reported TEAEs of fatigue (14.7% versus 7.1% and 0) and 
arthralgia (19.4% versus 12.1% and 4.5%). 
Immunological events  
Immunogenicity of adalimumab was evaluated in subjects with non-infectious uveitis in the two pivotal 
Phase 3 studies (Studies M10-877 and M10-880). In these studies, the percentage of subjects who 
received adalimumab 40 mg eow and testing positive for AAA was 4.8% (12/249) including both 
subjects from the main and the Japanese sub-studies.  
The results and effects on the PK of adalimumab in the uveitis population are further discussed in the 
PK section 2.3.2.1. of this report. With regards to the safety analysis, the rate of any AEs was 
comparable between AAA+ and AAA– subjects. One death (AAA– subject) occurred in each study, but 
as previously described, the investigators considered the events not related to study drug.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Specific drug-drug interactions were not evaluated in the uveitis clinical development program. 
However, in both studies M10-877 and M10-880, subjects were allowed to continue on 1 ongoing non-
biologic IMM at study entry provided the dose had not been increased within 28 days prior to Baseline; 
the dose was to remain unchanged throughout the study and be within the acceptable limits as defined 
in the study protocols.  
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the most frequently reported concomitant medication (≥20%) 
in either treatment group was prednisolone and prednisone. In the All Adalimumab Set, prednisolone 
and prednisone use was >30% and was accompanied by omeprazole, paracetamol and ibuprofen 
reported by >20% subjects.  In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set and in the All Adalimumab Set, 
over a third of all subjects reported using at least 1 concomitant systemic IMM at Baseline. 
Concomitant systemic IMMs reported at Baseline were MMF (or an equivalent drug), MTX, ciclosporin, 
and azathioprine.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, more TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in the 
adalimumab group than in the placebo group (9.2% vs 4.8%).  
In the All Adalimumab Analysis Set, the TEAEs leading to discontinuation reported by 2 or more 
subjects included: mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive (12 subjects); cystoid macular 
oedema (5 subjects); tuberculin test positive (4 subjects); demyelination and uveitis (3 subjects 
each); and vision blurred, visual acuity reduced, vitreous haemorrhage, and bronchitis, pneumonia, 
tuberculosis, and ON (2 subjects each). The events of tuberculosis and positive tuberculosis test, 
uveitis-related events, and ON have already been discussed (see above). 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post marketing experience for the use of Humira in patients with uveitis. 
The estimated cumulative post-marketing patient exposure since the international birth date through 
31 December 2014 was 3.5 million patient years. The currently ongoing adalimumab safety registries 
(including JIA, CD, UC, psoriasis, and pregnancy) comprise approximately 32,000 adult and paediatric 
patients. One MAH-sponsored registry of 3,435 patients (12,193.3 PYs of adalimumab exposure) with 
moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (ReAlise) has been completed.  
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database presented in support of this application includes data from 2 pivotal placebo-
controlled studies (studies M10-877 and M10-880), and an ongoing open-label extension study (study 
M11-327), which recruited 84% of the subjects from the 2 pivotal studies. Furthermore, the CHMP 
took into account the known safety profile of Humira across the range of approved indications, which 
has been well characterised with more than 9000 patients exposed in controlled and open clinical 
trials. In this context, the CHMP noted that the proposed dosing regimen for Humira in uveitis therapy 
was in line with the posology for psoriasis. 
Two analysis sets were defined for the integrated safety analyses for this application. The Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Set including study drug exposure (mean ± SD) of 241.6±191.07 days in the 
adalimumab group and 175.0±165.57 in the placebo group was intended for the assessment of the 
short- term safety profile for adalimumab. The All Adalimumab Analysis Set for the assessment of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 88/108 
 
 
 
 
long-term safety included data for subjects with a mean duration of exposure to adalimumab of 
81.1 weeks. 
The individual studies were generally balanced between placebo and adalimumab arms with regards to 
Baseline demographics, concomitant medication and disease history/characteristics (with few 
exceptions, see also more detailed discussion in section 2.4.4. ). Idiopathic and Birdshot choroidopathy 
dominated the diagnoses compared to the systemic diagnoses. 
Overall in the uveitis trials, in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 80.4% versus 87.2% of subjects 
reported any TEAE in the placebo and the adalimumab group, respectively, and 91.2% in the All 
Adalimumab Analysis Set. SAEs were reported by 10.0% versus 6.4% of the patients in the 
adalimumab and placebo group, respectively, in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. In the All 
Adalimumab Analysis Set, 18.3% of the patients reported any SAE. Almost 5% in the placebo group 
discontinued due to any TEAE compared to almost twice as many in the adalimumab group.  
The previously identified most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of Humira for the 
approved indications were infections, injection site reactions, headache and musculoskeletal pain. 
Serious infections as well as serious haematological, neurological, autoimmune reactions as well as 
malignancies had also been reported. The most frequently reported neoplasms were non-melanoma 
skin cancer and benign neoplasms (common). Solid organ neoplasms, melanoma and lymphoma are 
uncommon.  
The most common TEAEs in the clinical development program for uveitis with an incidence >10% were 
nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, headache and fatigue in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. There was a 
higher incidence of nasopharyngitis (17.6% versus 12.4%), arthralgia (15.2% versus 10.0%) and 
fatigue (10.4% versus 6.8%) in the adalimumab group compared to placebo. Serious TEAEs were 
generally few and consistent with the known safety profile of Humira, as described above, with the 
addition of ocular events that were likely to be related to the disease. Three deaths were reported in 
the trials but were considered unlikely to be related to Humira. 
Adalimumab affects the immune system and patients taking adalimumab are more susceptible to 
infections. The increased reporting of infections, mainly nasopharyngitis, following adalimumab 
administration in the uveitis studies is thus expected and consistent with the known safety profile of 
Humira. There was also an increased reporting of serious infections following adalimumab treatment, 
both for short (2.8% vs 1.6% placebo) and long term use (5.8%), which again was considered by the 
CHMP to be consistent with the known safety profile of Humira. Furthermore it is known that multiple 
immunosuppressants used in combination therapy have an additive effect, and an increased reporting 
of infections in this situation was thus not surprising (see also discussion on concomitant medication 
for uveitis treatment below). 
Generally, common adverse events in uveitis patients occurring with a frequency of ≥2% in the 
adalimumab group and >1.5 times compared to placebo, were consistent with the known safety profile 
of Humira. However, although small, there was an increased reporting rate in the adalimumab group 
compared to placebo of ocular events like uveitis, eye pain, vision blurred, IOP increased, and 
posterior capsular opacification. The difference in percentage may be explained by the longer exposure 
of the patients in the adalimumab group compared to those on placebo. Overall, ocular adverse events 
were considered likely due to the underlying uveitis. Reporting rates for uveitis in the adalimumab 
(8.0%) and placebo (6.8%) groups in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set increased with duration of 
exposure up to 20% in the All Adalimumab Analysis Set. Reporting of uveitis may have been due to 
lack of efficacy as well as worsening of the underlying disease. Further review of the study results by 
the MAH indeed suggested that lack of meeting the primary efficacy endpoint criteria (treatment 
failure) may have led to reporting of uveitis as an AE.

Pustular rash was reported by 6 subjects (2.4%) in the adalimumab group compared to none in the 
placebo group in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. Despite including very limited information, all 
cases were non-serious, the study drug was not interrupted and the event resolved despite continued 
Humira treatment. All but one case was assessed as not related to study drug and no further action 
was considered necessary by the CHMP given that rash and related events, including more severe skin 
reactions, are known ADRs of Humira and other anti-TNF inhibitors as reflected in the PI. 
Hyperglycaemia is also a known side effect of Humira and therefore the reports on diabetes mellitus in 
the uveitis trials including 5 (2.0%) subjects in the adalimumab group versus none in the placebo 
group in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, and 9 (1.9%) subjects in the All Adalimumab Analysis 
Set, did not raise concerns. In any event, considering the short study period, at least in the controlled 
studies, it was considered unlikely that diabetes mellitus occurred as a result of the treatment with 
adalimumab. 
Although the proposed dosing regimen for Humira in uveitis therapy is in line with the approved 
regimen for psoriasis, the CHMP noted the limited experience in the uveitis population, which is 
heterogeneous including uveitis as an isolated ocular disorder and also as part of a systemic disease. 
In particular, the choice of concomitant medication for treatment of uveitis patients is different 
compared to other previously approved indications for Humira. Almost all subjects in the pivotal uveitis 
studies used CS and/or IMMs. Their use was balanced between the treatment groups in the pivotal 
(short term) studies.  
Concomitant use of prednisolone was almost 40% in the All Adalimumab Analysis Set. Humira 
combined with CS in low doses (7.5 mg prednisone equivalent or less) is widely used in clinical praxis 
in the long-term treatment of RA, and the safety profile is well known. The safety profile of Humira in 
combination with CS up to 15 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) short-term (≤3 month) is also well 
known from clinical trials and post-marketing data. In contrast, the experience is limited for use of 
Humira in combination with high CS doses >15 mg/day (prednisone equivalent), both short and long-
term. When comparing safety data by CS dose intervals (0 mg, 0≤15 mg, and >15 mg), an increased 
reporting of TEAEs (including infections) can be seen in the >15 mg subgroup compared to the other 
groups, although the number of patient years was low. The rates of infections including serious 
infections were however broadly in line with previous clinical data as already described in the SmPC. 
While this was considered reassuring, still, the CHMP was of the view that the limited knowledge of the 
safety of Humira in combination with high doses of CS and medium doses in long-term use in the 
uveitis population was of concern and should be further addressed in future PSURs as well as in the 
RMP (see section 2.6. for details on the RMP). Further data were expected to be obtained from the 
open label extension study. 
More than a third (35.3%) of the study subjects used IMMs as concomitant medication, predominantly 
MTX and MMF, followed by azathioprine and ciclosporin. Humira in combination with MTX is approved 
for treatment of RA and the safety profile is well known. Likewise, there is wide experience of use of 
Humira together with azathioprine in inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, the combination of 
Humira with ciclosporin, MMF and tacrolimus is less well known. Further, combination of Humira with 
one or several IMMs can be expected in the uveitis population, with potentially new or increased risks 
for adverse effects. In addition, despite the long experience of Humira with MTX and azathioprine, it 
cannot be excluded that the uveitis population may react differently, depending on disease 
characteristics, possible other systemic inflammatory diseases associated with uveitis, as well as the 
choice of doses of the concomitant medications. Immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease treated with triple medication of IMMs (such as azathioprine or MTX), TNF-α antagonist and 
high dose CS have been shown to have an increased risk of opportunistic infections including 
pneumocystitis jiroveci. Fatal outcomes of pneumocystitis jiroveci infections have been reported. It is 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 90/108 
 
 
 
 
therefore recommended in the European clinical guideline (Second European evidence-based 
consensus on the prevention, diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections in inflammatory 
bowel disease) to consider prophylactic anti-infective therapy in this patient group. The CHMP 
therefore considered that the risk of fatal opportunistic infections (e.g. pneumocystis, legionellosis) 
following Humira and IMM triple medication should be followed in future PSURs in the uveitis indication 
and other indications. Otherwise, data on AEs of special interest with the respective IMMs and Humira 
is limited preventing any firm conclusions. 
Diagnosis of sarcoidosis at Baseline in the uveitis trials was balanced with about 13% of subjects in 
either study arm, with more case reports in study M10-880 than in M10-877. There was a three times 
higher incidence of reports of sarcoidosis as an AE in adalimumab treated subjects compared to 
placebo, but the numbers were overall low. Further information provided by the MAH showed that all 
AEs of sarcoidosis occurred in subjects that enrolled in the study with sarcoidosis-associated uveitis 
and/or had sarcoidosis in their medical history. Depending on the disease characteristics of these 
patients, the reporting of AEs of sarcoidosis may be an expression of worsening of the disease. There 
is an apparent contradictory effect of TNF-alpha antagonists, as they are used off-label in treatment of 
sarcoidosis but are also reported to be a trigger of the same disease. Sarcoidosis was already included 
in the product information (PI) as an uncommon ADR and in the RMP as important identified risk. The 
CHMP considered that sarcoidosis should continue to be reviewed in future PSURs.   
Occasional malignancies were reported in the adalimumab group (4 subjects, 1.6%) compared to no 
cases in the placebo group in the Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set of the uveitis trials. Considering the 
limited duration of treatment, an association with adalimumab was considered unlikely. The reported 
malignancies during the open-label extension study (n=12, 2.6%), including basal cell carcinoma 
(n=3) which is a common but clearly manageable adverse reaction of Humira, were difficult to 
interpret in terms of causality. The overall rate of malignancies decreased over time, as reflected in 
patient years (PY) with 2.4 compared to 1.7/100PYs for adalimumab treatment in the short and long 
term studies, respectively.   
Development of demyelinating disorders (including MS) is an important identified risk of Humira and is 
described in the RMP. Based on clinical trials and post-marketing experience with Humira, 
demyelinating disorders including ON and MS are rare events with a frequency of ≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000. At the same time, in the scientific literature, an association between demyelinating 
disorders and uveitis has been estimated at an incidence of MS ranging from 1.5–3.4 E/100 PYs and an 
incidence of ON ranging from 0.5–1.0 E/100 PYs. The incidence rates of demyelinating disorders and 
ON in patients with uveitis from MarketScan® data presented by the MAH were based on a total of 
103 877 patients, with a total incidence rate of 0.71 E/100 PYs in a population including all uveitis. 
This rate was similar to that found in the uveitis studies with Humira (0.83 E/100 PYs). However, when 
incidence rates were analysed by location of the inflammation, a higher rate was found for patients 
with posterior and intermediate uveitis in the uveitis trials compared to the MarketScan® data. A direct 
comparison between the two data sources was however considered difficult by the CHMP. 
Nevertheless, given that an association between demyelinating disorders and in particular intermediate 
uveitis has been described in the scientific literature, the CHMP was of the view that SmPC section 4.4. 
should be updated to inform prescribers accordingly. Furthermore, neurologic evaluation should be 
performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior and during Humira therapy to 
assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. Ophthalmologists are advised to 
consult specialists experienced in the use of Humira before initiation of Humira treatment. Prescribers 
are furthermore advised to consider discontinuation of Humira if any of these disorders develop. 
Demyelinating events should furthermore be followed in future PSURs.

Haematological events including pancytopenia, and hepatic events reported in the studies did not raise 
any concerns. Injection site disorders are listed as very common adverse reactions associated with 
subcutaneous injection of adalimumab. There were no serious or severe injection site reactions in the 
uveitis clinical development program. Finally, immune reactions reported in the uveitis studies were in 
line with previous experience with Humira. Development of AAA is discussed in section 2.3.2.1. 
Hypersensitivity is listed as a common adverse reaction in the SmPC of Humira. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Humira in the treatment of adult patients with non-infectious 
intermediate, posterior and pan-uveitis seemed to be broadly in line with that reported for other, 
previously approved indications. However, the safety analysis for use of Humira in uveitis is based on a 
relatively limited patient population and there are limited long-term data. Besides having different 
disease characteristics compared to the already approved target populations for Humira, uveitis 
patients are commonly co-treated with other immunosuppressive therapies to control the 
inflammation, thus leading to some uncertainties, including risks associated with immunosuppression. 
In addition, uveitis patients, in particular those with intermediate disease location, have been 
described in the scientific literature to be at risk of developing demyelinating disorders, which is also 
an important identified risk of Humira. To address these concerns, the RMP and SmPC were updated, 
including an extended warning on neurological events with further advice on demyelinating disorders.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated for all presentations of Humira except the vial (Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for 
injection), which is for paediatric use only. For the vial, relevant safety information was updated in 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. Particularly, an update to the warning on neurological events with regard 
to demyelinating disorders has been added to the product information for all presentations. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Changes to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 are shown below (additions are shown in bold, deletions 
as strike-through): 
•  SmPC section 4.1 
Uveitis 
Humira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and 
panuveitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in 
patients in need of corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is 
inappropriate. 
•  SmPC section 4.2 
Humira treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Humira is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised 
to consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Humira (see 
section 4.4). Patients treated with Humira should be given the special alert card. 
(…) 
Uveitis 
The recommended dose of Humira for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, 
followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is 
limited experience in the initiation of treatment with Humira alone. Treatment with Humira 
can be initiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic 
immunomodulatory agents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with 
clinical practice starting two weeks after initiating treatment with Humira.    
It is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be 
evaluated on a yearly basis (see section 5.1).   
(…) 
Paediatric uveitis  
The safety and efficacy of Humira in children aged 2-17 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
•  SmPC section 4.4 
Neurological events  
TNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or 
exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system

demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating 
disease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use 
of Humira in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system 
demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Humira should be considered if any of these 
disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central 
demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-
infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly during 
treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.  
(…) 
Elderly 
The frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.73.6%) 
was higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.51.4%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. 
Particular attention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which 
were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
The CHMP furthermore noted that SmPC section 5.1 was rather lengthy. The MAH should consider to 
shorten this section in a future procedure.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The established treatment of non-infectious uveitis consists of corticosteroids (CS), whereby 
inflammation involving the posterior segment of the eye usually requires systemic or intra-/periocular 
CS administration over prolonged periods of time. Long-term use of systemic or intra-/periocular CS is 
however associated with serious adverse reactions. IMMs and TNF-α inhibitors are also used in clinical 
practice but only ciclosporin is approved in this indication and its use is limited due to safety concerns. 
Thus, new effective therapies are needed, including agents allowing reduction in CS use. 
This extension of the indication of Humira for treatment of adult patients with non-infectious 
intermediate, posterior and pan-uveitis, was supported by two clinical trials, one in active uveitis, i.e. 
patients insufficiently controlled on 10-60 mg/day prednisone or equivalent (M10-877), and one in 
inactive uveitis, i.e. in maintenance therapy of CS dependent patients (10-35 mg/day prednisone 
equivalent, M10-880). The main studies recruited 452 adult subjects with various uveitis diagnoses, 
including both isolated disease (e.g. idiopathic, Birdshot choroidopathy) and uveitis as part of systemic 
disease (e.g. Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis and VKH), thus covering a wide range of patients with 
different disease aetiologies and reflecting the heterogeneous target population.  
From a statistical point of view, an effect of adalimumab with regards to the primary composite 
endpoint, time to treatment failure, has been convincingly demonstrated in both studies, although the 
size of the effect was limited. The median times to failure in active uveitis was 3 and 5.6 months for 
placebo and adalimumab, respectively, translating in a moderate difference of less than 3 months 
between treatment arms. In inactive uveitis, the corresponding median times to failure were 8.3 
months for placebo and >18 months for adalimumab (i.e. not estimable since fewer than 50% of 
patients had an event during the study). The risk of experiencing treatment failures was significantly 
reduced in patients receiving adalimumab compared to placebo with risk reductions of 50% (p<0.001) 
and 43 % (p=0.004) in active and inactive uveitis, respectively. The absolute difference in failure rates 
between treatment arms was 24% (78.5% for placebo versus 54.5% for adalimumab) and 15.8% 
(55.0% for placebo versus 39.1% for adalimumab) in active and inactive uveitis patients, respectively.  
Overall, the CHMP recognised that the patients enrolled in the clinical development program were 
representative of a population that is difficult to treat, with all subjects receiving concomitant systemic 
CS at study start and many also taking IMMs. Furthermore, the composite primary endpoint – time to 
treatment failure – was regarded to be highly sensitive to detect an intraocular inflammation since it 
captured both measurements of inflammation as well as a functional outcomes. The sensitivity of the 
composite endpoint was likely also the reason for the high failure rates observed in both studies. 
Taken together, based on the selected study population, the stringent primary endpoint and the rather 
aggressive CS tapering schedule, the observed beneficial effect, albeit modest in size, was considered 
by the CHMP to be of clinical relevance. Furthermore, in both studies, the Kaplan-Meier curves 
separated early and remained separated during the studies, supporting maintenance of the effect.  
For active uveitis, all components of the composite endpoint contributed to the difference in treatment 
failures (statistical significance for the components ranged from p <0.001 to 0.010) with the largest 
difference between active and placebo treatment observed for VH grade. There was also a numerical 
favour shown for adalimumab in terms of proportion of patients that reached quiescence (defined as 
no active inflammatory lesions and AC cell grade ≤ 0.5 and VH grade ≤ 0.5) from Week 6 onwards 
while tapering CS (still on 15 mg/day). As of Week 8 (10 mg/day CS), statistical significance was

Page 100/108 
 
 
 
 
reached (47 vs. 66% in the placebo and adalimumab groups, respectively, p=0.013). Furthermore, 
while overall few subjects had a relevant gain in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), generally and 
across all analyses conducted, there was a consistent trend in favour of adalimumab over placebo in 
terms of gaining, maintaining and losing vision during the study. With regards to other endpoints, 
including vision-related quality of life, adalimumab was generally favoured and statistically significant 
outcomes were achieved for the majority of variables. 
In inactive uveitis, the majority of treatment failures were due to loss in vision, i.e. the VA component 
of the composite endpoint (p=0.002, HR 0.33). For the other components of the primary endpoint as 
well as for the vast majority of secondary efficacy endpoints, adalimumab was numerically favoured, 
but statistical significance was not reached. As in study M10-877, adalimumab was consistently 
numerically favoured with regards to BCVA outcomes. 
Support for adalimumab as a steroid-sparing option was derived from analyses of the proportions of 
patients in quiescence without steroids, although the numbers were small. For both patients with 
active and inactive uveitis, greater proportions of patients receiving adalimumab remained in 
quiescence after tapering of steroids compared to placebo (Weeks 16, 36 and 52 for active uveitis, p-
values 0.027 to 0.056; Weeks 20, 40 and 52 for inactive uveitis, p-values 0.004 to 0.008). Similar 
results were obtained for steroid-free lack of inflammation (i.e. no active inflammatory lesions and 
both VH and AC cells = 0), whereby larger differences were observed between treatment arms for 
patients with inactive uveitis compared to those with active uveitis.  
Additional support for a steroid-sparing effect as well as for maintenance of the effect in the long-term 
was provided by the interim results of the ongoing, open-label extension study. While a relatively high 
proportion of patients who entered the study with active uveitis experienced a treatment failure/flare 
(54 %), for the majority of these patients the flare was followed by a long period of disease control 
with a median time to treatment failure of 12.5 months. In the subset of patients who failed while on 
adalimumab in the core studies, median time to failure was 9.7 months. Few patients with controlled 
uveitis at study entry experienced treatment failures (12.5%) and the time to treatment failure could 
not be estimated. Subjects entering the study without active disease generally maintained a low daily 
dose of CS over time (< 2 mg) while subjects entering the study with a flare were able to reduce the 
daily dose of CS from approximately 14 mg at study entry to approximately 4 mg after 1 year. At that 
time, 40/55 (73%) and 83/171 (48%) of subjects who entered the study with controlled and active 
uveitis, respectively, did not receive any concomitant systemic and/or local CS. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No dose-response studies have been conducted. The dose regimen selected for clinical development 
and proposed for commercial use, i.e. an initial loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab, followed by 40 mg 
every other week, was based on the regimen previously studied and approved for use in psoriasis. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP considered the dose regimen acceptable. However, analyses of 
systemic exposure levels in relation to the effect (prevention of treatment failure) indicated that 
steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations were on the lower side of the therapeutic range. 
Clinical trial simulations furthermore suggested a potentially greater benefit of a weekly maintenance 
dose of 40 mg adalimumab (approximately 15% additional decrease in failure rate compared to 40 mg 
eow). There is experience with this regimen in other indications for Humira seemingly without major 
safety concern and weekly dosing is sometimes also reported and recommended in the scientific 
literature. Therefore, the CHMP recommended for the MAH to study the weekly dose regimen in uveitis 
patients post approval as it may provide an increased benefit.  
With regards to the target population, the CHMP noted that during clinical development, Humira was 
used in patients already receiving conventional therapy (i.e. all patients initially received CS and some 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 101/108 
 
 
 
 
also IMMs). Consequently, the CHMP did not agree to a first line indication, but rather that Humira 
should be used only in patients with an inadequate response to CS, in need of CS-sparing, or when CS 
treatment is inappropriate. Furthermore, the proposal to initiate treatment with Humira without CS in 
patients with active uveitis was not considered to be sufficiently supported by the data from the clinical 
development program. There was only very limited data from the extension study and uncertainties 
remained if disease control with Humira alone could be obtained as quickly and to the same extend as 
in combination therapy. Consequently, the CHMP recommended initiating treatment only in 
combination with CS and/or IMMs.   
Anti-adalimumab antibody generation remained low regardless of concomitant IMM therapy (2.2% with 
and 6.3% without IMMs). The data were too limited to conclude whether an absence of a protective 
umbrella of prednisolone and immunosuppressive therapy would impact antibody formation. The PI 
already informs about the formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the finding of increased 
antibodies formation when Humira is used without concomitant methotrexate. No change to this 
information was considered necessary based on the data from the uveitis development program. 
The CHMP furthermore noted that in active uveitis, while all individual components of the primary 
endpoint contributed to the overall effect of adalimumab, the magnitudes of the mean changes in AC 
cell grade, VH grade and VA (that tended to decrease after an initial gain) were limited. This, however, 
could likely, at least in part, be explained by a “dilution” effect as the difference would be mainly 
driven by the cases of treatment failures and one individual disease manifestation (endpoint 
component) may or may not be associated with the other 3 components occurring both individually or 
in combination and in one or both eyes. The effect sizes for the individual components of the primary 
endpoint in patients with inactive uveitis were also rather small. However, in contrast to the study in 
active uveitis, the 4 parameters did not equally contribute to the overall treatment effect in patients 
with inactive uveitis even if adalimumab was numerically favoured for all components. Few subjects 
appeared to have failed due to other causes than worsening of BCVA (loss of ≥15 letters) and this 
vision loss occurred early in many cases. Such sudden decrease in vision was unexpected given the 
usual clinical course of the disease, whereby changes in retinal lesions and vision would be expected to 
occur gradually in patients with inactive uveitis and be preceded by episodes of active inflammation. 
Further analyses for the 33 patients with treatment failure due to a low of BCVA (23 in the placebo 
arm versus 10 in the adalimumab arm) showed that in all but 2 placebo-treated subjects, the loss of 
BCVA paralleled increases in one or more inflammation markers including AC cells, VH scores and/or 
central retinal thickness, however the cut-off for actual failures as defined in the primary endpoint was 
not always reached. Likewise, in all but one placebo-treated subject with an early loss of BCVA (around 
week 12 or earlier), this was associated with signs of low grade inflammation, but again, the threshold 
for failure was not always reached. Overall, these data supported an association of the observed early 
vision loss with disease manifestations. 
Even though the risk for treatment failure due to the worsening of VA was clearly reduced in the 
adalimumab group in patients with inactive uveitis, only a 2 letter (logMAR 0.04) mean difference in 
BCVA was observed compared to placebo. A plausible explanation for this small difference may be the 
limited difference in the rate of treatment failures due to BCVA loss as the main driver for this 
endpoint. On the other hand this finding only supports a modest treatment effect. The low number of 
treatment failures due to other causes than vision loss may also explain, at least in part, why for the 
vast majority of the key secondary efficacy variables in study M10-880 no statistically significant 
differences between the treatment groups were reached.  
Similarly, while data on quiescence and freedom of inflammation with and without steroids overall 
support a beneficial effect of adalimumab, they only showed an advantage in a small number of 
patients at various time points (less than 10% and 20% absolute difference between adalimumab and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 102/108 
 
 
 
 
placebo arm, in active and non-active uveitis, respectively). Again, this supports only a moderate 
beneficial effect. 
The interim results from the ongoing extension study were considered supportive, both in terms of 
maintenance of the treatment effect in the long-term as well as with regards to a steroid-sparing 
effect. However, although it is acknowledged that a large proportion of patients from the main studies 
entered the extension (82%), there were some limitations due to the uncontrolled nature of the study, 
the high drop-out rate (30%) and the fact that the study only represents a part of the initially 
randomised patient populations. For these reasons, the study results should be interpreted with 
caution.  
Finally, although adalimumab was favoured in the vast majority of subgroups, a limited effect size was 
observed in women where there was only 1 month difference in the median time to treatment failure 
between treatment arms. It is acknowledged that the studies were not powered to assess the effect in 
subgroups, but this finding was observed in both studies. It was suggested that the results were due to 
an imbalance in diagnosis, whereby substantially more women than men had a diagnosis of VKH while 
the opposite was observed for Behçet's disease. At the same time, a less prominent treatment effect 
was observed for VKH compared to Behçet's disease. Overall, the number of subjects concerned was 
too low to draw firm conclusions and the issue was not further pursued given that some additional 
support for an effect of Humira in both genders was available from the extension study, in which no 
major differences between men and women were observed. The CHMP also noted that in the subgroup 
analyses by location of the inflammation in study M10 877, adalimumab appeared less effective in 
intermediate uveitis. However, this observation was limited to only one of the two pivotal trials and 
due to the small sample size, no firm conclusions could be drawn.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported short-term TEAEs with an incidence of >10% for adalimumab in the 
placebo-controlled studies, were nasopharyngitis (17.6% vs 12.4% for adalimumab vs placebo), 
arthralgia (15.2% vs 10.0%) and fatigue (10.4% vs 6.8%). In addition, in the extension study, urinary 
tract infection (10.8%) and uveitis (20%) were reported frequently. The latter, i.e. reports of uveitis 
may be due to lack of efficacy as well as worsening of the underlying disease. Further review of the 
study results by the MAH indeed suggested that lack of meeting the primary efficacy endpoint criteria 
(treatment failure) was the primary reason underlying the reporting of uveitis as an adverse event. 
Overall the safety profile as observed in the uveitis studies was broadly consistent with the known 
safety profile of Humira with respect to adverse events as well as reporting frequencies, apart from the 
ocular events which were likely related to the underlying disease. Furthermore, reports of sarcoidosis 
were three times more frequent in adalimumab treated subjects compared to placebo (2.4% vs 0.8%). 
All adverse events of sarcoidosis occurred in subjects who entered the study with a history of 
sarcoidosis or diagnosis or sarcoidosis-associated uveitis. There is an apparent contradictory effect of 
TNF-alpha antagonists, as they are used off-label in treatment of sarcoidosis but are also reported to 
be a trigger of the same disorder. Sarcoidosis was already included in the PI as an uncommon ADR and 
in the RMP as important identified risk. No further conclusions could be drawn based on the data from 
the uveitis program. The CHMP requested that cases of sarcoidosis should be monitored and reviewed 
in future PSURs.   
There was furthermore an increased reporting rate of demyelinating disorders in the uveitis trials, 
which was not surprising given that demyelinating events are an important identified risk of Humira. 
However, since an association between demyelinating disorders and uveitis has been reported in the 
scientific literature, in particular for intermediate uveitis, the CHMP recommended that neurologic 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/501143/2016  
Page 103/108 
 
 
 
 
evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior and during 
Humira therapy to assess for pre-existing and developing central demyelinating disorders. 
Ophthalmologists are advised to consult specialists experienced in the use of Humira. Prescribers are 
furthermore advised to consider discontinuation of Humira if any of these disorders develop. SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 4.4. were updated accordingly. Furthermore, demyelinating events should be followed 
in future PSURs. 
Other previously identified safety concerns for Humira included infections and malignancies. Occasional 
malignancies were also reported in the adalimumab treated patients in the uveitis program but 
considering the limited duration of treatment in these cases, an association with adalimumab was 
considered unlikely. Similarly, cases of malignancies reported during the open-label extension study 
were difficult to interpret in terms of causality. Serious infections were also more frequently reported 
following adalimumab treatment compared to placebo, both for short (2.8% vs 1.6% placebo) and 
long term use (5.8%). Altogether, these findings were consistent with the known safety profile of 
Humira. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety analysis for use of Humira in the treatment of non-infectious uveitis was based on a 
relatively limited patient population and there are limited long-term data. However, at the same time, 
there is substantial experience with the long-term use of Humira in other, already approved 
indications. These data were considered relevant and supportive for the present application. 
Based on the experience in other indications, the safety profile of Humira combined with low dose CS 
long-term, and medium dose CS short-term is well known. However, there was limited information for 
use of Humira in combination with CS >15 mg/day (high dose) and in long-term  treatment with 7.5 to 
15 mg/day. Similarly, there is experience with Humira in combination with MTX (approved for 
treatment in RA) as well as with azathioprine (IBD). In contrast, the safety profile is not known for the 
combination of Humira with other IMMs (ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus). The 
choice and dosing of concomitant medication for treatment of uveitis patients is different compared to 
other previously approved indications of Humira and depending on the exact diagnosis, combination of 
Humira with one or several IMMs can be expected at least in a subset of the uveitis population. 
Therefore, uncertainties arose from the limited information on concomitant use of CS and other IMMs, 
including risks associated with immunosuppression. As an increased risk of opportunistic infections has 
been shown for IBD patients treated with triple medication of IMMs, TNF-α antagonist and high dose 
CS, the CHMP considered that the risk of infections, in particular fatal opportunistic infections (e.g. 
pneumocystis, legionellosis) following Humira and IMM triple medication, should be further monitored 
in future PSURs and in the RMP. Further data are expected to be obtained from the ongoing open label 
extension study.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A benefit effect of Humira in the treatment of adult patients with active non-infectious uveitis has been 
convincingly demonstrated with a compelling statistically significant effect on the primary composite 
endpoint and with adalimumab being favoured over placebo for the vast majority of secondary 
endpoints. Given the characteristics of the patient population and the stringent composite endpoint 
definition, the observed 3 months difference in the median time to treatment failure was considered of 
clinical relevance, although modest in size. Furthermore, evidence of rapid induction of disease control, 
albeit in combination with high doses of CS, and maintenance of quiescence with continued 
adalimumab treatment has been provided. In inactive uveitis, a robust statistical effect was also 
demonstrated with regards to the primary efficacy endpoint, time to treatment failure, thus showing a 
beneficial effect in maintaining quiescence over time and preventing recurrences (8 months for placebo 
and >18 months for adalimumab).  
In non-infectious uveitis, the treatment goal is to rapidly control acute inflammation, limit recurrences, 
reduce both dose and duration of systemic CS and limit decrease in visual acuity. In these regards, a 
consistent benefit has been shown for adalimumab. From the long-term extension study, it was 
apparent that with Humira, the disease is controlled over time, both in subjects that entered the study 
with active and inactive uveitis. With regards to inactive uveitis, the importance of maintaining patients 
in quiescence over time has to be given weight since with every recurrence there is a risk of 
irreversible vision loss. 
The benefits described above apply to the patient population studied in the clinical development 
program. Herein, Humira was used as could be anticipated in clinical practice, i.e. in patients receiving 
established therapies including systemic CS. In these patients, treatment with Humira resulted in less 
treatment failures after CS tapering compared to placebo and greater proportion of patients 
maintained quiescence without steroids, although the difference was modest. These data support a 
role of Humira as second line and steroid-sparing treatment option.  
Overall, the safety profile of Humira as observed in the uveitis clinical development program appeared 
to be in line with the safety profile previously described for other indications including the known 
important identified risks of malignancies and infections. Of relevance for uveitis was furthermore the 
risk of demyelinating disorders with Humira, as the scientific literature also suggests an increased risk 
of demyelination in patients with intermediate uveitis. Other concerns included sarcoidosis and the 
limited experience with the use of Humira in combination with e.g. high dose CS, ciclosporin, MMF and 
tacrolimus, which are expected to be used in the uveitis population.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the available data and subject to amendments to the product information and the RMP, the 
CHMP concluded that the benefits of Humira in the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior 
and pan-uveitis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients

in need of corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate, outweighed its 
risks. The benefit-risk balance was thus considered favourable. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Based on the available data, use of Humira as first line treatment option for non-infectious uveitis was 
not considered acceptable by the CHMP. Rather, based on the study population, who received, at least 
initially, systemic CS, use of Humira in adult patients with inadequate response to CS, in need of CS 
sparing or in whom CS treatment is inappropriate, was supported. Evidence for a beneficial effect of 
Humira in patients with inadequate response to CS was available from the clinical trials’ data which 
also supported a benefit of Humira as steroid-sparing option. Further, while not actually studied, the 
CHMP was of the view that there was no reason to believe that the efficacy or safety profile of Humira 
should be significantly different in a population where CS should be avoided and thus it was considered 
acceptable to include this population in the indication.  
The decision to restrict the indication to second-line therapy also took into account the safety profile of 
Humira and advice from an expert panel. The experts were asked to discuss the clinical relevance of 
the effects shown in the clinical development program and to comment on a suitable place in therapy 
for Humira. Taking into account the totality of the data, the experts considered that a beneficial effect 
of Humira had been convincingly demonstrated and that the second line indication was reasonable. 
Further restriction of the use of Humira such as to active disease, last line treatment or in terms of 
treatment duration was not considered justified. This view was supported by additional analyses 
presented in the course of the assessment including data showing similar efficacy in patients with and 
without additional IMMs as well as interim data from the extension study showing maintenance of the 
effect in the long-term. While, overall, there was sufficient support for persistence of the beneficial 
effect of Humira in the long-term, the CHMP considered that continuation of treatment should be re-
evaluated by physicians on an annual basis taking into account the benefits and risks of long-term 
treatment. This approach was agreed by the experts. 
The CHMP was furthermore of the view that Humira treatment should only be initiated in combination 
with CS and/or IMMs as there was insufficient evidence that disease control with Humira alone could 
be obtained as quickly and to the same extent as in combination therapy with CS. Thereafter, Humira 
could be used both in combination and monotherapy. CS may be tapered in accordance with clinical 
practice starting two weeks after treatment initiation with Humira. 
With regards to the dose regimen, the CHMP concluded that the proposed posology of an initial loading 
dose of 80 mg adalimumab, followed by 40 mg every other week was acceptable. However, the 
available data and simulations suggested that this regimen was sub-optimal and that a weekly 
maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab may result in an increased beneficial effect. Therefore, the 
CHMP recommended for the MAH to study the weekly dose regimen in uveitis patients post approval.  
With regards to safety, some uncertainties including a potentially increased risk for serious infection, in 
particular in combination therapy, remained. However, the available educational material, which also 
includes information on demyelinating disorders, was considered of importance for the new group of 
prescribers and patients. The risk of demyelinating events was also highlighted by the experts, who 
stated that they would not use Humira in patients with demyelinating disease or signs of development 
of such disease. This view was reflected in an update of the warning in SmPC section 4.4.

Extension of Indication to include treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in 
adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of 
corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated. The warning in SmPC section 4.4 
on neurological events was extended to provide additional advice on the monitoring and possible need 
for discontinuation in case of demyelinating disorders. The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10 and the MAH took 
the opportunity to make editorial amendments throughout the PI. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet as well as to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

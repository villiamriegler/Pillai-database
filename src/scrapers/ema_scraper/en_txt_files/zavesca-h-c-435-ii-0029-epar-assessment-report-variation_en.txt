Introduction 
3.1 
Zavesca is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first 
and committed step in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids. Treatment with Zavesca can be considered 
as  a  substrate  reduction 
the  centralised  procedure 
therapy.  Zavesca  was  authorised  by 
(EU/1/02/238/001)  under  exceptional  circumstances  in  November  2002,  for  the  oral  treatment  (100 
mg  t.i.d.)  of  mild  to  moderate  type  1  Gaucher  disease  in  patients  for  whom  enzyme  replacement 
therapy is unsuitable. 
On  16  February  2006,  Zavesca  was  granted  designation  as  an  Orphan  Medicinal  Product  for  the 
indication ‘Treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease, type C’ (EU/3/06/351). 
The  MAH  submitted  this  type  II  variation  application  to  extend  the  indication  for  Zavesca  in  the 
“treatment  of  progressive  neurological  manifestations  in  adult  patients  and  paediatric  patients  with 
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C disease).” 
Non-clinical aspects 
3.2 
The  non-clinical  documentation  for  the  new  indication  consists  of  an  addendum  to  the  non-clinical 
overview, an update to the pharmacokinetics written summary, and an update to the toxicology written 
summary. The proposed new indication, “treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult 
patients and paediatric patients with NP-C disease” involves a dose of 200 mg thrice daily (t.i.d.) to be 
compared with previously approved dose of 100 mg t.i.d. in Gaucher’s disease.  
The addendum to the non-clinical overview reviews the data available for miglustat also taking into 
account  the  new  clinical  dose  that  is  twice  as  high  as  for  Gaucher’s  disease.  All  toxicological  data 
have  been  previously  submitted.  Studies  include  a  13  week  mouse  study  completed  in  2002  and  a 
study report from a 13 week oral study dealing with investigations of rat brain glycolipids. A series of 
literature references is also provided. 
The  pharmacological  rationale  for  treatment  of  Niemann-Pick  disease  Type  C  is  based  on  substrate 
reduction  therapy,  reducing  the  amount  of  glucosylceramide  by  acting  on  the  first  step  on 
glycosphingolipid  biosynthesis.  In  some  non-clinical  models  of  lipid  storage  disease,  miglustat  has 
been shown to have the potential to reduce storage of glycosphingolipids and enhance survival. Two 
murine models of Niemann-Pick C have been described in the literature, but no specific studies with 
miglustat using these models appear available. In other mouse models, such as the Sandhoff mouse, of 
neurodegenerative  disease,  miglustat  induced  a  significant  reduction  of  glycosphingolipids.  Data 
indicate though that CNS storage burden is not the only factor in clinical disease onset.  
The  preclinical  pharmacokinetics  of  miglustat  has  been  previously  characterised.  Distribution  into 
brain has been shown in mouse, rat and monkey.  
The  toxicology  of  miglustat  was  assessed  at  the  time  of  the  application  for  MA  for  treatment  in 
Gauchers  disease.  The  main  target  organs  for  toxicity  are  the  gastrointestinal  system  and  male 
reproductive tract. A NOEL could be established in only two of the repeated dose toxicity studies and 
corresponded to x1 and x5 the estimated exposure in humans. The application to extend the indication 
to  Niemann-Pick  Disease,  type  C’  involves  a  dose  twice  as  high  (200  mg  t.i.d.)  and  margins  of 
exposure  may  thus  be  expected  to  be  even  lower,  if  identifiable  at  all.  However,  considering  the 
clinical particulars these issues might not have an impact on the overall risk benefit assessment.   
A 13 week  mouse study (GLP, QA)  was  completed in 2002. Groups of 10 male  and 10 female rats 
were  administered  miglustat  by  gavage  3  times  daily  at  levels  of  0,  100,  420  and  840  mg/kg/day. 
Clinical  signs,  body  weights,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry  and  necropsy  were  recorded  for  all 
animals. Histopathology was conducted on a comprehensive list of tissues from control and high dose 
animals.  Clinical  signs  consisted  of  hunched  posture,  subdued  behaviour,  rolling  gait,  piloerection, 
weight  loss  and  respiratory  signs.  Increases  in  AST  were  recorded  for  the  high  dose  group  with  no 
histological correlate. Statistically significant increases in weight of liver (males from 420 mg/kg/d), 
spleen 
females)  were  noted.  
Minimal  splenic  megakaryocytosis  in  all  treated  male  animals  and  increased  lymphocytolysis  in 
(female  high  dose)  and  brain 
(from  420  mg/kg/d 
in 
Page 2 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thymus  in  males  and  females  was  noted.  A  NOEL  was  not  identified.  Toxicokinetic  data  showed 
supraproportional  increases  in  systemic  exposure  with  dose  on  day  1,  but  there  was  no  evidence  of 
accumulation from day 1 to week 13. In females, reduced platelet counts seemed to correlate with the 
incidence  of  splenic  megakaryocytosis  and  this  was  considered  a  regenerative  response  to  reduced 
platelet counts.  
Miglustat  penetrates  the  blood-brain  barrier  and  distributes  to  the  cerebrospinal  fluid.  Rat  brain 
glycolipids  were  analysed  from  a  13  week  study  in  male  rats  given  doses  of  180,  340  or  420 
mg/kg/day.  No  consistent  effects  of  miglustat  on  gangliosides,  sulfatide  glycolipids  or 
galactosylceramide  were  reported.  In  neutral  brain  glycolipid  subfractions,  a  band  comigrating  with 
the glucosylceramide band doublet was evident. In brains from recovery and control animals no such 
band  was  detected.  It  was  estimated  that  miglustat  caused  an  approximately  2  fold  increase  in  a 
glycolipid  band  and  limited  analysis  was  consistent  with  the  band  being  glucosylceramide.    The 
increase  appeared  reversible  and  it  is  suggested  that  a  difference  in  sensitivity  of  glucosylceramide 
synthase  and  non-lysosomal  glucosylceramidase  towards  inhibition  by  miglustat  may  play  a  role  in 
this.  It  is  of  interest  to  note  that  in  nonclinical  models  of  GM2  diseases  interventions  such  as  bone 
marrow  transplant,  although  having  no  effect  on  brain  glycolipids,  appeared  to  have  an  increased 
effect on survival compared with substrate reduction therapy regimens. The relevance of these data for 
the human disease is unknown.  
The  identification  of  appropriate  parameters  for  comparison  animal  and  human  data  is  not 
straightforward. However, many of the effects seen in animal studies have already been identified in 
the  clinic  and  strategies  proposed  for  their  management  and  these  are  considered  resolved  from  the 
non-clinical point of view and considered in the current revised SPC. One issue concerns male fertility 
and effects on sperm which is an identified effect and is considered adequately addressed in section 
5.3.  
In  one  study,  results  showed  a  potential  of  miglustat  to  inhibit  non-lysosomal  glucosylceramidase 
(later identified as β-glucosidase 2) with an IC50 of 200 nM to compare with an IC50 of 20 to 50 µM 
for inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis.  This data, although limited and including uncertainties 
as to threshold values at which effects became apparent, also indicated that the text in 5.1 should be 
revised.  
It  is  concluded  that  from  the  non-clinical  point  of  view  there  are  no  new  issues  that  should  be 
addressed in relation to an extension of indication to include Niemann-Pick Type C disease. 
CHMP conclusions 
The CHMP concluded that the revision of sections 5.1 and 5.3 and overall the changes proposed are 
considered acceptable.  
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  an  ERA  according  to  the  current  guideline  was  not  presented.  Therefore 
the MAH was asked to justify the absence of the ERA or to conduct an environmental risk assessment 
according to the guideline on the environmental risk assessment of the medicinal products for human 
use. 
A  further  commitment  is  made  by  the  MAH  to  provide  a  revised  ERA  for  Zavesca  no  later  than 
middle of February 2009.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

3.3.   Clinical aspects 
3.3.1. Clinical pharmacology 
New pharmacokinetic information on miglustat comes from three recently performed clinical studies. 
In these studies (OGT 918-006, OGT 918-007, and OGT 918-009) miglustat was given at a dose of 
200 mg t.i.d., i.e., twice the currently approved dose for the treatment of adult type 1 Gaucher patients. 
Paediatric  patients  were  also  included  in  studies  OGT  918-006  and  OGT  918-007,  and  were  dosed 
based on body surface area (BSA).  
Study OGT 918-007 
In this study, 4 children (ages ranging from 5 to 11) and 6 adolescents/adults (ages ranging from 12 to 
39)  with  NP-C  disease  provided  blood  samples  for  pharmacokinetic  evaluation  after  1  month  of 
treatment  with  miglustat.  Adolescent/adult  patients  received  200  mg  TID  OGT  918,  and  juvenile 
patients received doses that were adjusted according to their BSA.

Study OGT 918-006 
In this study, 6 children (ages ranging from 2 to 8) and 7 adolescents/adults (ages ranging from 12 to 
19) with type 3 Gaucher disease (GD-3) provided blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation after 
1  month  of  treatment  with  miglustat.  In  addition,  pre-dose  (trough)  samples  of  cerebrospinal  fluid 
(CSF) and blood were taken at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12, for comparison of miglustat concentrations 
in CSF relative to that in plasma. Patients over and under 12 years were to receive 200 mg TID OGT 
918. However, doses were adjusted according to their BSA.

Blood samples (4 mL from patients over 12 years or 2 mL from patients under 12 years) were taken 
during Month 1 at pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h post-dose. Additional trough 
samples were taken during Months 3, 6, 9 or 12. Seven patients also had a CSF taken: from 3 patients 
over 12 years during Months 1, 6 and 12, and from 4 patients under 12 years during Months 1, 3, 6 
and 9, for the determination of trough CSF concentrations. The CSF and plasma analyses of OGT 918 
were  performed  using  previously  validated  LC-MS  methods.  The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were 
derived by non-compartmental analysis. 
The  geometric  mean  (geometric  mean  coefficients  of  variation  in  parentheses)  pharmacokinetic 
parameters of OGT 918 are summarised below:

Patients 106, 109, 111 and 208 received 200 mg TID

Patient 107 received 200 mg (a.m.) and 100 mg (p.m.).  
Patients 203 and 204 received 100 mg OD 
Concentrations of miglustat in CSF ranged from 201 to 512 ng/ml (37% to 42% of that in plasma) for 
patients aged 12 and over and from 365 to 677 ng/ml (31% to 67% of that in plasma) for patients aged 
less than 12 years. This observation indicates that miglustat is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. 
Study OGT 918-009 
In this study, 6 adult patients with late onset Tay Sachs disease (LOTS) provided blood samples for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation after 1 month of treatment with miglustat 200 mg t.i.d. In addition, in 2 of 
these  6  patients,  trough  CSF  samples  were  taken  at  Month  1  for  comparison  of  miglustat 
concentrations in CSF relative to that in plasma. The exposure to miglustat as measured by AUC0-8h 
and Cmax was similar in this study when compared to exposure reached in studies OGT 918-006 and 
OGT  918-007.  The  mean  (geometric  mean  coefficients  of  variation  in  parentheses)  pharmacokinetic 
parameters of OGT 918 are summarised below (n = 6; unless otherwise stated [n]): 
In  the  2  patients  who  provided  CSF  samples,  concentrations  of  miglustat  in  CSF  were  382  and  747 
ng/ml  (29%  and  42%  of  that  in  plasma),  indicating  that  miglustat  is  able  to  cross  the  blood-brain 
barrier.

Consistent with the higher dose given, the plasma concentrations of miglustat were higher in the GD-3 
and  NP-C  disease  patients  than  in  type  1  Gaucher  disease  patients.  Cmax  and  AUCτ  values  were 
approximately two-fold those observed in adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients administered miglustat 
100 mg t.i.d., consistent with the linear pharmacokinetics of miglustat.  
Comparison of exposure to miglustat in adult type 1 Gaucher subjects and paediatric subjects 
with type 3 Gaucher disease or Niemann-Pick type C disease 
Data are shown as individual AUCtau values (ng.ml/h). The geometric means as indicated by the horizontal lines were 
16,285, 19,044, and 7,556 ng.ml/h, in Niemann Pick C, Gaucher type 3 and Gaucher type 1 patients, respectively. Data 
are from studies OGT 918-007 (Niemann-Pick type C), OGT-918-006 (type 3 Gaucher) and OGT 918-001 and -005 
(type 1 Gaucher). 
In addition, as mentioned above, in the study in GD-3 disease patients (OGT 918-006), it was shown 
that the concentration of miglustat in CSF ranged from 31.4% to 67.2% of that in plasma, indicating 
good penetration across the blood-brain barrier.  
The  average  exposure  to  miglustat  was  18475  ng.h/ml  in  the  LOTS  patient  population,  which  was 
similar to that observed in GD-3 and NP-C patients treated with the same dose. Also, the limited data 
available indicate that the CSF penetration of miglustat in LOTS patients was similar to that observed 
in GD-3 patients. 
Together, these new data indicate that dosing of miglustat with the adult target dose of 200 mg t.i.d., 
with  adjustment  based  on  body  surface  area  in  paediatric  patients,  and  as  used  in  the  clinical  trials, 
yields  exposure  values  to  miglustat  which  are  comparable  over  a  wide  age  range  in  paediatric  and 
adult patients. The concentration of miglustat obtained in the CSF of subjects treated with this regimen 
is comparable to that in plasma of adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients treated with miglustat 100 mg 
t.i.d.  It  may,  thus,  be  expected  that  at  the  proposed  dosing  regimen  of  200  mg  t.i.d.,  sufficient 
quantities  of  miglustat  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier  to  inhibit  the  target  enzyme  glucosylceramide 
synthase in the brain. 
To  further  substantiate  the  pharmacokinetic  adequacy  of  the  dosing  recommendation,  analyses  were 
produced of AUC0-8h, Cmax  and Cmin (or pre-dose concentration) vs age, BSA and body weight. CL/F 
(calculated as dose/AUC0-8hr) plotted vs age, BSA and body weight. 
No  clear  trends  for  an  influence  of  any  of  the  demographic  variables  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
miglustat could be discerned. Together with the rather small variability in exposure of only about 2-
fold across the paediatric age range studied, this would support that the chosen dosing is appropriate.

Bod y surface area ( cm 2)
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  calculations  suffer  from  the  weakness  that  for  those  patients  receiving 
miglustat twice a day, AUC0-8hr does not properly reflect exposure to miglustat. For these patients an 
AUC0-12hr  should  have  been  calculated  (but  was  not  possible  due  to  the  limited  blood-sampling 
scheme),  and  for  all  patients  the  AUC  should  have  been  normalised  to  a  24-hour  AUC  for  proper 
comparison between patients who received miglustat b.i.d. or t.i.d.  
Finally,  although  a  dosing  regimen  based  on  body  surface  area  may  not  be  ideal,  the  observed  low 
variability in exposure in the tested patient population indicates that the dosing regimen investigated is 
appropriate based on PK considerations. 
Conclusions on pharmacological data 
Additional pharmacokinetic data for miglustat was obtained in paediatric/adolescent and adult patients 
with  NP-C  disease,  paediatric  /adolescents  patients  with  GD-3  disease  and  in  adults  patients  with 
LOTS. Adults received 200 mg t.i.d., i.e. twice the dose presently recommended for patients with type

1  Gaucher  disease.  Children  and  adolescents  received  doses  adjusted  according  to  their  BSA, 
corresponding to the doses proposed in the SPC. Plasma samples for PK evaluation were taken during 
8  h  after  one  month’s  treatment.  AUC0-8h  was  calculated  by  trapezoidal  methodology.  As  dosing 
scheduled  differed  from  once  to  three  times  daily,  use  of  AUC0-8h  has  its  limitations  but  provides  a 
rough comparison of exposure. Differences between dosing schedules is likely somewhat larger than 
that observed in the comparison of AUC0-8h. 
Ten children in the age range 2-11 years and 13 adolescent/adults in the age range 12-39 years were 
included  in  studies  -006  and  -007.  The  provided  plots  of  AUC0-8h,  Cmax    and  Cmin  (or  pre-dose 
concentration)  vs  age,  body  surface  area  and  body  weight  show  that  the  PK  parameters  each  vary 
within an approximate 2-fold range, and there seem to be no relationship between the PK parameters 
and age, body weight or BSA. As the data represent a mixture of different dosage regimens (BID and 
TID dosing) and the AUC for BID dosing is underestimated, it would have been useful if different 
symbols had been used for the different treatment regimens. The MAH has presented data only from 
study 007. Given the low number of patients, it would have been useful if also data from study 006 
had been included. 
The data presented showed no trends for influence on CL/F by age, weight or BSA. However, CL/F 
was calculated as dose /AUC0-8h, which is not an accurate estimate of CL/F for BID dosing. In patients 
with BID dosing (3 subjects with BSA<1.25 m2), CL/F has been overestimated. With a lower CL/F in 
these  subjects,  there  could  be  a  trend  for  a  relationship  between  all  PK  parameters  and  CL/F,  with 
lower CL/F in the lower BSA / age / weight range (assuming that the 3 subjects with BSA<1.25 m2 
receiving BID dosing are the youngest subjects of lowest weight). 
The  MAH  claimed  that  the  BSA  based  dosing  is  adequate  as  the  exposure  varies  between  a  2-fold 
range and miglustat does not have a narrow therapeutic window. Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to 
evaluate this as the MAH had not provided CL/F estimates and as AUC had been underestimated in 
the  smaller  children.  However,  Cmax  is  fairly  well  described  and  the  presented  AUC  and  CL/F  data 
vary within a fairly narrow range. Also, dosing by BSA in children on average seems to result in fairly 
similar  exposure  as  200  mg  TID  in  adolescents  /  adults.  Therefore,  the  lack  of  a  more  detailed 
evaluation is accepted. The presented data suggest no clear trends for age or body weight being better 
predictors of exposure than BSA, suggesting that dosage by BSA is appropriate.  
Concentrations of miglustat in CSF of between 200 and 677 ng/ml were obtained. The MAH claimed 
that  these  concentrations  are  similar  to  those  observed  in  plasma  at  100  mg  TID  in  type  1  Gaucher 
disease. Simulations made by the MAH during the approval procedure for Zavesca indicated that the 
plasma  concentration  on  average  fluctuates  between  about  800  and  2000  ng/ml.  Hence,  CSF 
concentrations obtained with 200 mg TID dosing seem to be lower than those observed in plasma at 
100 mg TID in type 1 Gaucher disease. It can be concluded that miglustat is able to cross the blood-
brain  barrier.  However,  based  on  these  data,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  if  sufficient  quantities  of 
miglustat cross the blood-brain barrier to inhibit the target enzyme glucosylceramide synthase in the 
brain.

Study OGT 918-007  
Study Design 
This was a randomized, parallel group, open-label, controlled study conducted at two sites: one in the 
United Kingdom (UK) and one in the United States (USA). Since there are no available therapies for 
NP-C, the control arm selected was No Treatment, i.e., standard care.  
Patients  randomized  to  miglustat  received  a  dose  of  200  mg  t.i.d.  for  12  months  while  patients 
randomized  to  No  Treatment  received  standard  care.  Patients  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to 
miglustat or No Treatment using a blocked central randomization but were not stratified by center to 
limit  the  chances  of  the  investigating  site  being  able  to  predict  the  treatment  assignment.  Both 
randomized  groups  followed  an  identical  visit  schedule.  Inclusion  criteria  were  based  on  confirmed 
disease  (abnormal  cholesterol  esterification  and  abnormal  filipin  staining)  and  the  ability  of  the 
patients to ingest the study medication in the form of capsule. 
1) The Main study was designed to have a 12-month controlled, comparative period (miglustat versus 
No Treatment)  during  which  patients  were  evaluated  every  3 months,  with  a    28-day  screening 
period. The study period was completed when all patients completed the 12-month study.  
2) The 12-month optional Extended Study was designed to offer 12 months therapy to patients who 
were randomized to No Treatment in the 12-month randomized period and to offer a further 12 months 
therapy to those patients originally randomized to miglustat. The Extended Study had an open-label, 
non-comparative study design. Patients were evaluated every 3 months to Month 24.  
3) The optional continued treatment extension period permitted all patients to continue with therapy 
beyond 24 months if it was considered by the Investigator to be in the best interests of the patient.   
4) The Pediatric sub-study was performed to investigate the efficacy of miglustat in paediatric patients 
with NP-C younger than 12 years. The Pediatric sub-study had an open-label, non-comparative design. 
All paediatric patients received treatment with miglustat (at a starting dose equivalent to 200 mg t.i.d.). 
The miglustat dose was adjusted according to BSA. This study was followed by an extension period of 
12 months. 
5)  The  individual  patient  efficacy  analysis  from  study  OGT 918-007  was  an  exploratory  analysis  of 
individual efficacy data for a sub-group of 29 patients: 19 from the Main study and 10 patients from 
the  Pediatric  sub-study.  The  analysis  was  undertaken  in  order  to  explore  any  possible  association 
between disease severity at baseline and treatment response.  
Study population 
Of  the  29  patients  in  the  original  study,  14  were  male  and  15  were  female.  The  mean  age  of  the 
patients  was  24.6  years  (standard  deviation  [SD]  =  9.1).  There  was  a  higher  proportion  of  patients 
aged 12–17 years in the No Treatment group (44%) when compared with the miglustat group (25%). 
A greater proportion of patients in the miglustat group reported the various manifestations of NP-C (in 
particular neurological symptoms). The pediatric study included patients above 4 years and under 12 
years of age, with a mean age of 7.2 ± 2.5.

Efficacy measurements  
The primary efficacy assessment of the study was the measurement of saccadic eye movements, based 
on expert consideration. The primary analysis endpoint was the mean change from baseline to Month 
12 for Horizontal saccadic eye movements (HSEM-).   
The  following  secondary  endpoints  were  assessed  in  the  studies:  Swallowing,  evoked  potentials, 
physical  performance  assessments,  neuropsychological  tests,  neurological  examination,  nerve 
conduction  velocity  and  tremor,  organ  volumes,  isometric  muscle  strength,  speech  tests,  pulmonary 
tests, biochemical markers of disease burden and quality of life measures. 
Patient disposition 
A total of 29 juvenile/adult NP-C patients were randomized, 20 to miglustat and 9 to No Treatment in 
addition  to  standard  care.  Three  patients  receiving  miglustat  withdrew  from  the  12-month  study 
prematurely.  Two  withdrew  due  to  AEs  while  one  patient  withdrew  for  other  reasons  (unacceptable 
disease progression and evidence of progressive neuro-degeneration). In the No Treatment group, one 
patient  withdrew  to  start  treatment  with  an  alternative  therapy.  A  total  of  25 patients  completed  the 
12-month  controlled  period  and  entered  the  12-month  non-controlled  Extended  Study  (17  from  the 
miglustat  group  and  8  from  the  No  Treatment  group).  Nineteen  patients  completed  the  12-month 
Extended  Study  (15/17 patients  from  the  miglustat  group  (24  months  miglustat  therapy)  and  4/8 
patients from the No Treatment group (12 months miglustat therapy).  
Of the 19 patients who completed the 24-month visit, 16 patients (14 from the original miglustat group 
and 2 from the original No treatment group) entered the continued treatment extension period. All 16 
patients  completed  at  least  6  months  of  the  extension  period  (to  Month  30)  and  13  completed  the 
study. At this point, patients had received treatment up to a maximum of 66 months (adults/juveniles) 
or 48 months (pediatrics). Three patients were withdrawn prior to study closure. All patients who were 
in the study at the closure date continued to receive miglustat after the closure date. 
The pediatric sub-study included 12 patients.

Retrospective survey of neurological outcomes (Stage I survey) 
Methods 
The Stage I retrospective survey of neurological outcomes was conducted between July 2007 and July 
2008.  The  survey  was  designed  to  collect  available  data,  particularly  on  neurological  outcomes, 
physician’s  global  assessment  of  the  utility  of  treatment,  and  main  reasons  for  discontinuation  of 
treatment in NP-C patients treated with miglustat. Furthermore data on seizure activity and frequency 
was included in the survey. 
Using  a  web-based  survey,  38  sites/physicians  were  invited  to  enter  demographic  and  clinical  data 
from NP-C patients treated with miglustat. Twenty-five physicians had entered data at the time of the 
summary  report.  Physicians  were  asked  to  complete  a  questionnaire  for  each  patient  who  had  been 
treated with miglustat . Data collection was via a secure website.  
Sixty-six patients were included in the analysis. Patients had been on treatment with  miglustat for  a 
mean of 543 days. At the time of the questionnaire, treatment was ongoing in 54 of the 66 patients and 
had been discontinued in 10 patients.  
Data  were  available  for  36  pediatric  patients  and  30  adult/juvenile  patients.    Mean  age  at  treatment 
start was 12.8 years overall, range 0.6 to 43 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.7 years, range 0 to 
32  years.  Patients  had  been  under  observation  for  a  mean  of  3.1  years  between  diagnosis  of  NP-C 
disease and start of treatment with miglustat and had been on treatment with miglustat for a mean of 
543 days (approximately 1½ years). 
For  patients  in  the  Stage  I  survey  and  those  included  in  both  survey  I  and  II,  treatment  duration  is 
summarized below.

Overall,  dosing  was  comparable  between  the  survey  and  the  study  OGT  918-007  with  41  of  61 
patients with dosing data available (67%) receiving at least 300 mg per day of miglustat.  
Retrospective survey of natural history of neurological disease (Stage II survey) 
Methods 
The Stage II retrospective survey of the natural history of neurological disease in NP-C patients was 
conducted  between  June  2007  and  August  2008.  The  web-based  survey  was  conducted  in  order  to 
corroborate the robustness of findings from the Stage I survey and to better understand the pattern of 
neurological disease progression in NP-C patients. The survey was aimed at retrospectively evaluating 
the  natural  course  of  the  disease,  and,  when  possible,  to  compare  it  with  changes  of  neurological 
disease  progression  rate  after  treatment  with  miglustat,  as  analyzed  also  in  the  Stage  I  survey.  By 
completing  a  questionnaire  on  a  secure  website,  seven  physicians  had  provided  data  relating  to 
57 patients (35 pediatric and 22 adult/juvenile). This included data for 19 patients who had previously 
been included in the Stage I survey and had received miglustat treatment. The mean (SD) time interval 
between the first visit at diagnosis and the last visit was 5.5 (4.8) years. 
The rating scale used in the survey of natural history was the same as that used in the Stage I survey 
and was applied in an identical manner. The scale was used to score the severity of disturbance in the 
parameters ambulation, manipulation, language articulation and swallowing at each visit.   
Results  
Study OGT 918-007  
Primary endpoint 
A  mean  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint,  HSEM-,  was  shown  in  adult  and  juvenile  patients 
receiving  miglustat  relative  to  No  Treatment  in  the  12-month  randomized  period.  Increases  (i.e., 
worsening) from baseline in HSEM-were observed for both groups at Month 24 and at the last visit 
(last value). Differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant. 
Secondary endpoints  
  Swallowing 
A statistically significant shift towards improvement was observed with miglustat compared with the 
No Treatment group (p = 0.044) for swallowing the one-third cookie at the end of the main, controlled 
study. For other substances, the shifts were not statistically different between the treatment groups at 
last value or Month 12. At Month 6, a significant shift was observed with miglustat compared with the 
No Treatment group (p = 0.043) for swallowing the puree.

Overall,  among  patients  with  both  baseline  and  Month  12  data,  improved  or  stable  swallowing 
functions were seen in 15/17 patients (88%) on miglustat, with 2 patients (12%) showing deterioration. 
For the No Treatment group, 5/8 patients (62%) showed deterioration and 3 patients (38%), improved. 
At the last value assessment in the 12-month extension period the ability to swallow water, puree, soft 
lumps and one-third of a cookie had improved or remained stable compared to baseline for a higher 
proportion of patients in the 24 months miglustat group than in the 12 months miglustat group. At the 
last  value  assessment,  the  ability  to  swallow  water,  puree,  soft  lumps  and  one-third  of  a  cookie  had 
improved or remained stable compared to baseline for 13 (87%), 12 (80%), 11 (73%) and 13 (87%) of 
the 15 patients in the 24 months miglustat group. Improved or stable ability to swallow water, puree, 
and  one-third  of  a  cookie  were  seen  for  two  (40%)  of  the  five  patients  in  the  12 months  miglustat 
group and improved or stable ability to swallow soft lumps in two of four patients (50%). 
Most of the ten pediatric patients in the efficacy set swallowed all four substances (water, puree, soft 
lumps and one-third of a cookie) easily at baseline, therefore, few patients had scope for improvement. 
This was the same for the last value assessment. 
  Physical performance tests 
Standard  Ambulation  Index  (SAI)  scores  increased  during  the  12-month,  controlled    period,  but  the 
increase (i.e., deterioration) was less in patients on miglustat than in the No Treatment group.

Paediatric NP-C patients showed a small mean increase (deterioration) in SAI score over12 months of 
miglustat treatment which was similar to that observed in miglustat-treated juvenile/adult patients. 
In the assessment of the SAI after 24 months of treatment, there was a smaller increase from baseline 
to  last  value  in  the  patients  in  the  24 months  miglustat  group  (0.3)  compared  with  the  12 months 
miglustat  group  (1.2)  (estimated  treatment  difference:  1.377;  95%  CI:  2.720,  0.034;  p = 0.045; 
ANCOVA).  
  Neuropsychological tests 
NP-C patients treated with miglustat showed a mean improvement in Mini Mental Status Examination

deteriorated.

NP-C patients treated with miglustat had a mean decrease (deterioration) in the Purdue Pegboard Test 
score  over  the  12-month  study  period,  whereas  patients  in  the  No  Treatment  group  had  a  relatively 
stable score.  
  Quality of Life assessments 
Most  of  the  NP-C  patients  in  the  main  analysis  were  ≥  14  years  of  age  and  completed  the  SF-36 
questionnaire.  In  four  of  the  eight  domains  (bodily  pain,  general  health,  social  functioning,  mental 
health)  and  the  physical  component  summary  score,  mean  improvements  from  baseline  to  the  last 
value were observed with miglustat compared with deterioration in the No Treatment group.  
A smaller deterioration was observed in the miglustat group compared with the No Treatment group 
in two other domains (vitality, role physical). Patients on miglustat fared less well than those in the No 
Treatment  group  in  the  domains  of  physical  functioning  and  role  emotional,  and  in  the  mental 
component  summary  score.  However,  none  of  these  differences  between  treatment  groups  were 
statistically significant in post-hoc analyses. 
Three  paediatric  NP-C  patients  completed  the  Children’s  Health  Questionnaire  –  Parent  form-50 
questionnaire  (CHQ-PF50).  Substantial  mean  increases  (i.e.,  improvements)  from  baseline  to  last 
value were observed in the domains role social behaviour, role physical, bodily pain, self-esteem, and 
family cohesion. 
Continued treatment extension period 
On  completion  of  Month  24  (Extended  Study)  an  option  of  continued  treatment  with  miglustat  was 
provided. This was a prospective, open-label, study design and the efficacy analysis was exploratory. 
In  the  assessment  of  swallowing,  eleven  (> 75%)  of  the  14  patients  with  available  data  showed 
improvement  or  stability  in  swallowing  ability.    Three  patients  (21%)  showed  deterioration  in 
swallowing in the 5 mL of water; two patients (14%) worsened in swallowing the 1-teaspoon of soft 
lumps  and  in  the  1-teaspoon  of  puree  assessments;  one  patient  worsened  in  swallowing  1/3  of  a 
cookie.  
Mean ambulatory index score showed a slight deterioration from baseline to last value. The majority 
of patients (8 out of 12, 67%) showed no change in score.  
Individual patient analysis 
A  total  of  29  patients  were  included  in  the  individual  patient  efficacy  analysis:  19  from  study  OGT 
918-007 and 10 from the Pediatric sub-study.  All patients had received at least 12 months of treatment 
with miglustat.  
For  the  overall  response  analysis,  each  patient  was  defined  as  stable  if  none  of  the  variables 
swallowing function, ambulation index and MMSE was deteriorated. Patients were considered stable 
also if only deterioration of HSEM-α occurred whilst the other three clinical parameters  were either 
stable or improved. Alternatively, patients were defined as deteriorated.

In  the  Main  study,  13  patients  showed  overall  disease  stabilization  and  6  patients  showed 
deterioration. Of the 6 patients with deterioration, one patient showed only deterioration of swallowing 
Page 16 of 35 
 
 
 
 
function and one showed only deterioration of cognitive performance as shown by MMSE changes. In 
the  paediatric  study,  8  patients  showed  overall  disease  stabilization  and  2  patients  showed 
deterioration.  Overall,  among  29  patients  assessed,  21  patients  (72.4%)  showed  overall  disease 
stabilization, 8 (27.6%) patients showed disease deterioration. 
The analysis of the relationship between disease severity at baseline and treatment response was not 
conclusive. Although the highest (100%) and the lowest (33%) response rates were observed among 
patients  with  the  mildest  (n = 4)  and  the  most  severe  (n = 3)  disease  at  baseline,  respectively,  the 
confidence intervals were wide. The response rate in nine patients with moderate disease at baseline 
(77.8%) was comparable to that (75.0%) in 12 patients with mild disease at baseline.  
Retrospective survey of neurological outcomes (Stage I survey) 
Efficacy  was  assessed  using  a  disability  scale  measuring  the  status  of  ambulation,  manipulation, 
language  articulation  and  swallowing  function  at  three  distinct  time  points,  i.e.,  at  the  time  of 
diagnosis, at treatment start and at last clinical contact or discontinuation of miglustat.  
  Neurological parameters 
At  the  time  of  diagnosis  of  NP-C,  some  degree  of  ambulatory  disability  was  described  for  66%  of 
patients.  During  the  period  between  diagnosis  of  NP-C  and  start  of  treatment  with  miglustat,  this 
increased  to  89%;  no  patient  showed  spontaneous  improvement.  During  treatment  with  miglustat, 
ambulation  was  reported  as  improved  in  9/64  patients  with  data  available  (14%)  and  was  stable  in 
40/64 patients (62%). Fifteen patients (23%) showed progressive deterioration of ambulatory function 
during treatment with miglustat.

Concerning  articulation,  abnormal  findings  were  described  for  62%  of  patients.  During  the  period 
between  diagnosis  of  NP-C  and  start  of  treatment  with  miglustat,  this  increased  to  87%;  no  patient

 
Individual parameter score 
An  individual  score  was  calculated  for  each  of  the  four  parameters  based  on  a  published  disease-
specific disability scale. The scale was used to score the severity of disturbances in the parameters. For 
the purpose of the analysis, the original scale was slightly modified in order to consistently assign to 
each of the four parameters a score ranging from 0 (the best grade) to 1 (the worst grade).

In order to provide an estimate of the rate of overall disease progression, the absolute changes of the 
composite score over time were adjusted for the time intervals between the three time points.  
The  progression  rate  decreased  significantly  from  0.11  score  units/year  between  diagnosis  and 
treatment  start  to  −0.01  units/year  after  miglustat  initiation  (paired  sample  test  comparison  by 
Wilcoxon signed rank test Z = −3.03; p = 0.002). 
 Progression rate during observation and treatment periods 
  Responder analysis 
Patients were stratified according to the number of worsened parameters after initiation of miglustat 
treatment.  Subjects  were  classified  either  as  “good  responders”  if  none  or  only  one  out  of  four 
parameters worsened after treatment, and as “poor responders” if two or more parameters worsened: 
75% of patients were classified as “good responders” and 25% as “poor responders”.

Progression rates during observation and treatment periods in ‘good responders’ and ‘poor responders’ 
(Mean and 95% CI) 
An analysis was conducted to compare the characteristics of the “good responders” compared with the 
“poor responders”. The mean age at diagnosis and at treatment start was lower in the poor responder 
group. Disease severity (as indicated by the composite score) at diagnosis and at treatment start was 
similar in “good” and “poor responders”. However, disease progression rate prior to miglustat was 2.5 
times higher in “poor responders” than in “good responders”. In ‘poor responders’ annual progression 
rate was 0.21 (95% C.I. -0.10-0.51) between diagnosis and treatment start  and 0.24 (95% C.I. 0.09-
0.39)  after  treatment.  A  multivariate  stepwise  logistic  regression  analysis  indicated  that  age  at 
diagnosis was the most significant predictor of response. 
Patients  were  therefore  stratified  in  three  groups,  based  on  age  at  diagnosis:  the  “early  childhood” 
group of those aged less than 6 years at diagnosis, “late childhood” of those aged between 6 and 11, 
and the “juveniles/adults” of those aged 12 years or older. 
The  progression  rate  of  neurological  disease  before  treatment  initiation  was  fastest  in  the  early 
childhood  group  and  lowest  among  juveniles/adults.  After  treatment,  the  disease  progression  rate 
appeared  to  decrease  across  all  age  groups.  Overall,  the  annual  disease  progression  rate  seemed 
reduced  in  the  youngest  group,  became  slightly  negative  (indicating  disease  stability)  in  the  late 
childhood group, and was clearly reversed (indicating improvement) in the juvenile-adult patients.

An analysis was performed also in the subgroups of patients with neurological disease at diagnosis (n 
= 49), and patients with progressive neurological disease between diagnosis and treatment start (n = 
44).  In  both  subgroups,  after  treatment  with  miglustat,  the  progression  rate  became  negative 
(indicating  a  general  improvement):  the  treatment  difference  was  statistically  significant  and 
numerically larger than observed in the whole population.

  Physician’s global assessment  
Patients’ general health was considered improved (much or somewhat better, 37%) or stable (40%) for 
77% of patients.  The overall assessment of patients’ benefit from miglustat treatment was good (41%) 
or fair (33%) in 74% of patients. Physicians indicated their intention to continue miglustat in 52 (96%) 
out of 54 patients who were on treatment with miglustat at the time of the last visit.  
  Reasons for discontinuation 
At  the  time  of  the  questionnaire,  miglustat  treatment  was  ongoing  in  54  of  the  66  patients  and  had 
been discontinued in 10 patients.

  Seizure activity and frequency 
Participating physicians were asked to report seizure activity and frequency at diagnosis, at treatment 
initiation, and at last clinical contact. At the time of diagnosis of NP-C disease, seizure activity was 
present in 13% of patients. During the period between diagnosis of NP-C disease and start of treatment 
with miglustat, this fraction increased to 25%. At start of miglustat treatment, 47 patients were free of 
seizures, of whom 7developed seizures while on miglustat treatment. Of the 16 patients with seizures 
at treatment start, one was reported to have no seizure activity at last contact. 
The 7 patients who developed seizures over treatment with miglustat were younger at diagnosis and 
treatment  start,  showed  a  larger  annual  change  of  the  composite  score  after  treatment  start,  and  a 
higher number of worsened parameters of the disability scale. Seizure activity at treatment start was 
not associated with a higher discontinuation rate. 
Retrospective survey of natural history of neurological disease (Stage II survey) 
At  the  time  of  diagnosis  of  NP-C,  some  degree  of  ambulatory  disability  was  described  for  61%  of 
patients.  This  increased  to  89%  during  the  period  of  observation.  Forty-four  patients  overall  (77%) 
showed progressive deterioration of ambulatory function between diagnosis and last visit.   
For manipulation, at the time of diagnosis of NP-C, manipulation was abnormal in 51% of patients. 
This increased to 86% during the period of observation. Forty-one patients (72%) showed progressive 
deterioration of manipulation during the natural course of the disease as measured from diagnosis to 
last visit.  
Language articulation was abnormal in 42% of patients at time of diagnosis, which increased to 86% 
of  patients  during  the  period  of  observation.  Thirty-six  patients  (63%)  showed  progressive 
deterioration of language skills from diagnosis to last visit. 
Abnormal swallowing function was described for 18% of patients at diagnosis and deteriorated during 
the period of observation and a total of 77% of patients had abnormal swallowing function at the last 
visit. Thirty-nine patients (70%) showed progressive deterioration of swallowing over the observation 
period.

increased  substantially, 
indicating  considerable 
Page 24 of 35 
 
 
 
 
 
The annual rate of progression was analyzed for patients with a time interval of at least 1 year between 
diagnosis  and  last  visit  and  was  similar  across  the  4  different  parameters.  The  composite  score 
progressed  by  0.11  units/year.  This  rate  was  the  same  as  observed  in  the  Stage  I  survey  between 
diagnosis and treatment start. In the Stage II survey, the pattern of progression of the composite score 
did not show any sign of plateau or even partial deceleration over the natural course of the disease. For 
each  of  the  four  parameters,  the  progression  rate  appeared  continuous,  without  any  apparent 
spontaneous decline of its average rate or any individual remission. Progression rate was consistently 
faster among patients with the lowest age-at-diagnosis. 
Concerning  seizure  activity  and  frequency  seizure  activity  was  present  in  three  patients  (5%)  at  the 
time of diagnosis. During the period between diagnosis of NP-C disease and last visit, the 
proportion of patients with seizure activity rose to 32% (18 patients). 
Using the rating scale, subjects were classified either as with ‘stable’ disease if none or only one out of 
four parameters had worsened during the period of observation, or with ‘progressed’ disease if at least 
two parameters had worsened: among patients (N = 49) with a time interval of at least 1 year between 
the first visit at diagnosis and the last visit, 14% of patients had ‘stable’ disease and 86% ‘progressed’. 
No patients showed ‘improvement’. 
Retrospective survey of neurological outcomes (Stage I +II survey) 
Nineteen patients in the natural history survey dataset had also been included in the previous Stage I 
survey. The use of the same scale for the evaluation of the neurological disease progression allowed a 
comparison of the time changes of the four single scores and of the composite score before treatment 
(for a mean time interval of 4.9 years) and after miglustat treatment (for a mean duration of 1.2 years).  
Progression of disease as seen in the increase in ambulation, manipulation and language articulation 
score,  which  was  continuous  over  the  natural  course  of  the  disease,  was  halted  after  treatment  with 
miglustat.  The  swallowing  score,  which  was  the  most  rapidly  progressive  before  treatment  start, 
decreased after treatment.

Additional patient case reports 
Data  were  additionally  provided  for  14  miglustat  treated  patients  and  one  control.  These  were 
retrospective case summaries provided by the treating physicians.  
Study OGT 918-006 (GD-3) 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Month 12 in Vertical saccadic eye movements 
(VSEM  α),  and  results  indicated  a  general  worsening  with  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between treatment groups. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in other 
Saccadic  eye  movements  (SEM)  or  in  most  other  secondary  efficacy  variables,  including  evoked 
potentials, neuropsychological tests, neurological examination results, liver and spleen volumes, and 
pulmonary function variables. 
Most  patients  completed  the  CHQ-PF50  questionnaire,  quality  of  life  instrument.  Global  health  and 
global behaviour worsened from baseline in both groups. 
Overall, the study was unable to demonstrate a consistent beneficial effect of miglustat as add-on to 
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on VSEM or the other markers of GD-3 assessed.

Variables of primary interest included muscle and grip strength measures, and the Rainbow Passage 
Test (speech), none of which showed a statistically significant treatment effect with miglustat over the 
first 12 months of treatment. No statistically significant treatment effects were observed in secondary 
variables.  In  general,  LOTS  patients  in  this  study  showed  deterioration  over  time  with  or  without 
miglustat treatment. 
Conclusions on efficacy 
The  pivotal  study  for  the  indication  (Study  OGT  918-007  main  study,  12  months  extension  and 
paediatric sub-study) was submitted as part of the application for the NP-C extension of indication.The 
current  application  also  includes  an  optional  extension  of  the  pivotal  study  in  which  16  patients 
received  treatment  up  to  a  maximum  of  66  months  (adults/juveniles)  or  48  months  (pediatrics).  
Efficacy analyses were only explorative and due to the open-label, uncontrolled design and the limited 
number of patients, it is difficult to draw any conclusions concerning long term efficacy. 
In addition, the MAH presented data from 66 patients in a retrospective survey of patients treated off-
label  with  miglustat.  In  this  survey  ambulation,  manipulation,  articulation  and  swallowing  were 
assessed  at  diagnosis,  at  the  time  of  treatment  initiation  and  at  last  clinical  contact/treatment 
discontinuation.  The  results  for  the  parameters  were  rather  similar.  There  was  a  deterioration  of  an 
additional 20-25 % of the patients between the time of diagnosis until treatment start with miglustat, 
without any improvements, resulting in 65-90% of the patients having abnormal assessments for the 
different  parameters  respectively,  at  the  time  of  treatment  initiation.  In  spite  of  the  treatment  with 
miglustat,  20-25  %  of  the  patients  deteriorated  further,  but  an  improvement  was  reported  in 
approximately  15%  of  the  patients.  The  results  were  also  presented  as  individual  and  composite 
scores. Even though composite scores may not be fully validated, they could be of use for the purpose 
of further trying to evaluate the findings. The MAH had calculated an annual rate of deterioration of 
the  composite  score  and  based  on  these  calculations,  the  results  in  the  survey  show  a  slowing  of 
progression after initiation of miglustat. 
 The score was also used in the second retrospective survey with the purpose to evaluate the natural 
course of NP-C disease. The results indicate that there is a continuous progression of the disease for a 
majority of the patients and that improvement seems to be unlikely. 
Data are also presented for 19 patients who were included in both surveys. Compared to time before 
treatment, a stabilisation of the disease for these patients after treatment initiation with miglustat was 
reported. These results are based on few patients, and considering the intended long-term treatment, 
1.2 years  of  treatment  duration  must  be  considered  as  rather  short.  However,  the  results  support  the 
fact  that  at  least  some  patients  benefit  from  the  treatment.  In  the  SPC  it  is  stated  that  the  benefit  of 
treatment should be evaluated on regular basis, e.g. every 6 months and that continuation of therapy 
should be re-appraised after at least 1 year of treatment with miglustat. This may be a way to limit the 
treatment to those who really benefit from it. 
Considering the retrospective, uncontrolled, non-randomised design of the surveys, the results should 
be  interpreted  with  care.  The  results  do  however  support  the  fact  that  the  activity  seen  in  the  main 
study could translate into clinically relevant benefits for some patients.  
Although  efforts  were  made  to  identify  patient  characteristics  that  could  predefine  responders  to  the 
treatment, due to the limited numbers of patients, this was not easily done. However, there were some 
indications that patients with early onset of disease and/or rapidly progressing disease are less likely to 
respond to the treatment. In the survey, data indicates that age at treatment start may be an indicator of 
treatment result as younger patients may have a less favourable outcome. However, the data are too 
limited to draw any firm conclusions concerning subgroups with an expected higher/lower benefit. 
In  addition,  since  up  to  now  there  are  no  data  available,  regarding  the  number  of  the  patients  who 
might  benefit  most  from  treatment  with  miglustat,  ongoing  patient  evaluation  after  beginning  of 
treatment is mentioned in the SPC.

Overall the data showed that treatment with Zavesca can reduce the progression of clinically relevant 
neurological symptoms in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease. 
3.3.3. Clinical safety 
Miglustat  is  associated  with  a  high  incidence  of  diarrhoea,  flatulence,  abdominal  discomfort/pain, 
nausea, or combinations thereof. The pharmacological mechanism is most likely the inhibitory effect 
of  miglustat  on  intestinal  disaccharidases,  resulting  in  carbohydrate  maldigestion  and  consequent 
osmotic diarrhoea with related symptoms and signs.  
The other area of potential concern with miglustat has been the nervous system. There is evidence that 
miglustat is associated with tremor or worsening of previous tremor and is also likely to be associated 
with an increased incidence of headache and dizziness.  
In the early phase of treatment with miglustat, reduced growth has been reported in some paediatric 
patients with NP- C disease. Growth should be monitored in paediatric and adolescent patients during 
treatment with Zavesca and the benefit/risk balance should be re-assessed on an individual basis for 
continuation of therapy. 
The  potential  association  of  miglustat  with  peripheral  neuropathy  and/or  cognitive  disturbance 
generated in the first registration studies in type 1 Gaucher disease have been analysed and discussed 
in detail in previous submissions. There have been no further signals of these serious events either in 
studies or post-marketing experience. 
3.3.3.1. Patient exposure 
Patient  exposure  to  miglustat  in  trials  OGT 918-006,  -007,  -009  and  their  respective  extensions,  is 
summarised below. The mean duration of exposure to miglustat was 2.0 years in study OGT 918-006, 
2.6 years (adult/juvenile patients) and 2.7 years (paediatric patients) in study OGT 918-007, and 2.2 
years in study OGT 918-009.

Common adverse events  
  Gastrointestinal intolerance 
High incidences of diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal complaints were reported in miglustat treated 
patients.  Diarrhoea,  in  particular,  was  frequent  and  considered  severe  and/or  reached  NCI  toxicity 
grade  3  in  several  cases.  However,  there  was  only  one  premature  withdrawal  due  to  diarrhoea. 
Gastrointestinal complaints appeared to be less frequent among paediatric than juvenile and adult NP-
C patients. The incidence of diarrhoea over time appeared to decrease, which may have been related to 
the use of loperamide and/or improved tolerance to miglustat.

  Weight  and Height 
Among  NP-C  patients,  weight  decrease  was  reported  for  65%  of  juvenile/adult  miglustat-treated 
patients (versus none in the No Treatment group) and in 25% of treated paediatric patients. All except 
one of the patients with decreased weight also experienced diarrhoea during the study. In most cases, 
weight loss was < 20%, however one juvenile/adult patient had a ≥ 20% decrease in body weight. No 
NP-C patient had miglustat discontinued because of weight loss.  
In  juvenile/adult  patients,  mean  body  weight  decreased  with  miglustat  treatment  but  appeared  to 
stabilise after 9 months, whereas the mean body weight of paediatric NP-C patients increased slightly 
over  12  months  of  miglustat  treatment.  Associated  with  the  miglustat-related  weight  loss,  a  few 
patients  had  a  downward  shift  in  BMI  category,  but  few  patients  in  the  program  were  considered 
underweight.

treatment. After that, median height remained stable at the same percentile.

  Neurological safety 
Tremor  was reported in nine miglustat-treated juvenile/adult NP-C patients (45%) and two paediatric 
patients  (17%),  but  14  juvenile/adult  (70%)  and  three  paediatric  patients  (25%)  experienced  at  least 
one  AE  denoting  tremor  (preferred  terms  tremor,  aggravated  tremor,  and/or  intention  tremor).  All 
cases of tremor were of mild or moderate intensity. 
An  independent  analysis  of  the  data  concluded  that  tremor  was  present  at  baseline  in  23  of  28 
evaluated patients. Of the 26 cases with at least two available assessments over time, 3 patients had a 
tremor emerge where previously there was none (all on miglustat), 3 had a worsening of tremor over 
time (all on miglustat), and 1 patient showed an improvement in tremor (No Treatment group). 
In  juvenile/adult  NP-C  patient,  AEs  of  paraesthaesia  or  sensory  loss  were  reported  in  35%  of 
miglustat-treated patients compared with 11% in the No Treatment group, and peripheral neuropathy 
or  polyneuropathy  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  2  (10%)  vs  0  patients,  respectively.  Periodical 
neurological evaluation found that the proportion of patients with abnormal vibratory sense was higher 
in the miglustat than the No Treatment group (30% vs 11% at last value compared with 10% vs 0 at 
baseline 
Prospective studies of nerve conduction velocity were performed as part of the efficacy assessments. 
In  OGT  918-007,  a  mild  sensory-motor  polyneuropathy  was  present  at  baseline  in  9  of  27  patients 
with data at  baseline (5/18 patients in the  miglustat group; 4/9 patients in the No Treatment group), 
and in 11 of 28 patients with data at Month 12 (6/19 patients in the miglustat group; 5/9 patients in the 
No Treatment group). Of the 23 patients with assessments at baseline and Month 12, 2 patients were 
noted to have findings compatible with an emergent sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. 
Two patients with NP-C disease reported clonic convulsions after 3–6 months on miglustat, versus no 
patients in the No Treatment group. In the paediatric sub-study, two patients reported tonic or clonic 
convulsions  after  6–9  months  on  miglustat.  None  of  the  affected  patients  had  a  medical  history  of 
seizures.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
  Deaths 
No patients died during the 12-month controlled study. 
  Serious adverse events 
Eleven patients reported a total of 23 SAEs. The most frequent SAEs were infections and infestations 
and gastrointestinal disorders. Seven patients withdrew because of AEs in the Main study and two in 
the  Paediatric  Sub-study.  None  of  the  SAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  considered  related  to 
miglustat treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
  Haemoglobin concentration and platelet count 
The  small  mean  decrease  in  haemoglobin  concentration  observed in  miglustat-treated  NP-C  patients 
compared with the increase in the No Treatment group was not statistically significant. 
The 12% mean decrease in platelet count among miglustat-treated NP-C patients compared with the 
small mean increase in the No Treatment group approached statistical significance in the analysis (p = 
0.060).The mean baseline value was higher in the miglustat group, and the greater decrease in platelets 
was  not  associated  with  clinically  significant  thrombocytopenia.  The  majority  of  the  decrease  in 
platelets occurred during the first 3 months of treatment, with relatively stable counts thereafter. 
In paediatric NP-C patients, the decrease in platelets with miglustat was greater than in juvenile/adult 
patients (−41.0 vs −23.3 × 109/L), as counts continued to decrease after the 3-month assessment. Nine 
of the 12 paediatric patients had at least one value that was below the normal range, but decreases in 
platelets  were  not  associated  with  AE  reports  of  thrombocytopenia,  bruising,  or  bleeding  except  for 
two mild cases of epistaxis.

Postmarketing data 
The safety profile of miglustat has been further evaluated during the post-marketing period using the 
IS3  post-marketing  surveillance  programme  in  the  EU.  At  present,  marketing  approval  for  miglustat 
has been obtained from health authorities in the Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, 
Switzerland, Turkey and United States. 
An estimated 595 patients have been exposed to Zavesca since its introduction. Of these patients, 141 
were in clinical trials and 454 were exposed to commercial Zavesca, comprising 246 adults and elderly 
(54.2%),  143  children/infants  (31.5%)  and  60  adolescents  (13.2%).  The  age  was  not  reported  for  5 
patients (1.1%). 
A  total  of  273  AE  reports  were  received  since  International  Birth  Date  (IBD),  with  162  cases 
considered to be related to miglustat, and 58 ADR reports assessed as ‘serious’. Of the total number of 
reports,  66%  originated  through  post-marketing  surveillance,  and  18.7%  originated  through 
spontaneous  reporting.  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (22.9%)  and  Nervous  system/psychiatric  disorders 
(21.5%  and  4.6%)  accounted  for  almost  half  of  all  reported  events.  Nervous  system/psychiatric 
disorders (26.1%), General disorders (10.4%), Investigations (11.2%), and Musculoskeletal disorders 
(6.4%) also reflect the underlying conditions of the patients taking Zavesca. 
The estimated cumulative ‘post-marketing’ reporting rate was 49%, and 34% for reports assessed as 
related to Zavesca. Since IBD (excluding clinical trial reports) 454 case reports have been received for 
commercial Zavesca. The reporting rate for the most commonly reported events was 18.5% (84/454) 
for diarrhoea, 8.6% (39/454) for tremor, 4.4% (20/454) for unspecified neurological symptoms, 12.3% 
(56/454)  for  weight  decrease,  3.3%  (15/454)  for  memory  impairment,  and  2.6%  (12/454)  for 
convulsions. 
Eleven reports with fatal outcome have been received since IBD outside of clinical trials. One of these 
11  patients  was  treated  for  type  1  Gaucher  disease,  with  the  remainder  being  treated  for  other 
indications. All fatal events were reported as unrelated to Zavesca, and most patients died of disease 
progression.  
In conclusion, the safety profile of miglustat in the post-marketing period is similar to that observed in 
clinical studies with respect to gastrointestinal disturbances, weight loss, and tremor. 
Conclusions on safety 
The CHMP concluded that overall, the side effect profile of miglustat is known (gastrointestinal side 
effects, tremor, weight loss, impaired growth and low platelet count) and adequately addressed in the 
SPC. Furthermore, the CHMP concluded that special problems will be further evaluated in the NP-C 
disease registry (platelet count, weight and growth, risk of polyneuropathy or seizures, etc.).

The Annex II has been updated accordingly. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  RMP  is  well  structured  and  comprehensive.  There  is  an  already 
existing  post-marketing  safety  surveillance  programme  IS3.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  has  presented  a 
new  registry  concerning  the  specific  diagnosis  of  NP-C  disease.  This  registry  can  produce  valuable 
data involving safety aspects but also efficacy data with regard to the use of miglustat.  The initiation 
of the NP-C registry is essential for the approval of the new indication. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  with  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal 
product. The RMP was acceptable to the CHMP.

Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment 
The CHMP acknowledged that there is currently no treatment available for NP-C disease.  
The pharmacological rationale for treatment of NP-C disease is based on substrate reduction therapy. 
In some non-clinical models of lipid storage disease, miglustat has been shown to have the potential to 
reduce storage of glycosphingolipids and enhance survival. 
Available data show that miglustat treatment can have a clinically relevant ability to slow down the 
progression of neurological symptoms of NP-C disease in some patients.  
The  main  safety  issues  (gastrointestinal  side  effects,  reduced  growth,  CNS  effects  and  decrease  of 
platelets) are considered as covered in the product information and RMP. 
There  is  limited  data  concerning  long  term  treatment  both  concerning  efficacy  and  safety.  The 
initiation  of  the  NP-C  registry  is  essential  for  the  approval  of  the  new  indication  and  a  further 
commitment  is  made  by  the  MAH  to  provide  the  final  documents  concerning  the  NP-C  disease 
registry for Zavesca no later than middle of February 2009.  
IV.  CONCLUSION 
On 18 December 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet. 
Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these 
commitments (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report): 
Area1 
Description 
Pharmacovigilance  The MAH should establish a Niemann-Pick type C disease 
Non-clinical 
Registry. The Registry should be submitted for assessment and 
endorsement by the CHMP including the following: 
1. Efficacy parameters. 
2. Characteristics of ''responders'' / ''non responders''. 
3. Analysis of long-term efficacy results. 
The MAH should justify the absence of the ERA or conduct an 
environmental risk assessment according to the guideline on the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  the  medicinal  products  for 
human use.

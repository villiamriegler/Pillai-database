2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
IgPro20 is a ready-to-use 20% protein liquid formulation of a polyvalent human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
preparation for subcutaneous administration. The protein moiety of IgPro20 is highly purified IgG (≥ 98% 
purity); more than 90% of the IgG consists of monomers and dimers. IgG function (Fc and Fab mediated 
activity) is retained. The sterile 20% IgG solution is formulated with 250 mmol/L L-proline and 20 mg/L 
polysorbate  80  at  pH  4.8.  IgPro20  contains  no  preservative.  Wherever  possible,  specifications  and 
analytical  methods  have  been  selected  in  compliance  with  both  the  USP  and  the  Ph.  Eur.  The 
manufacturing  process  of  the  subcutaneous  immunoglobulin  (SCIG)  solution  Hizentra  is  based  on  the 
IgPro10 (Privigen: EMEA/H/C/831) process except for formulation and final protein concentration. Filling 
sizes include 5 mL (1 g), 10 mL (2 g), 15 mL (3 g) and 20 mL (4 g). 
Assessment report

IgPro20  is  approved  in  the  US,  EU,  Switzerland,  Latin  America,  Eastern  Europe,  Canada,  Japan,  and 
Australia  under  the  trade  name  of  Hizentra  for  s.c.  application  in  the  treatment  of  Primary 
Immunodeficiency  (PID).  In  the  EU,  IgPro20  is  also  approved  for  replacement  therapy  in  myeloma  or 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections. 
In  general,  IV  immunoglobulins  (IVIG)  targets  various  cellular  (such  as  dendritic  cells,  macrophages, 
monocytes,  B  and  T  cells)  and  soluble  compartments  (cytokines,  complements,  auto-antibodies,  and 
auto-antigens)  of  the  immune  system  that  are  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  autoimmune  disease. 
These mechanisms are non-exclusive and work synergistically to provide their therapeutic effects, which 
is  essentially  neutralization  of  the  activated  complement,  inactivation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines, 
downregulation of Fc receptors, adhesion to molecules on macrophage, and modulation of B-cells. 
The  exact  pharmacotherapeutic  mechanisms  in  auto-immune  disorders  are  unclear;  however,  there  is 
some  evidence  that  IGs  exert  their  action  in  part  through  up-regulation  of  the  inhibitory  FcγIIB  cell 
receptor  on  effector  cells,  whose  function  is  to  balance  the  activity  of  activating  FcγRs,  dismissing 
inflammatory  response  by  delivering  inhibitory  signals.  This  mechanism  was  shown  for  CIDP  patients 
when  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  In  addition,  number  of  circulating  CD4+  CD25+  T-  regulatory  cells 
was  shown  to  be  reduced  in  CIDP  patients.  Increased  frequency  of  genotype  GA13-16  of  the  SH2D2A 
gene encoding for a T-cell-specific adapter protein in CIDP patients may result in a defective control and 
elimination of  autoreactive  T  cells.  IVlG  treatment  has  been  shown  to increase  numbers  and function  of 
peripheral CD4+ CD25+ T-regulatory cells in a mouse model.   
CIDP  is  an  acquired  polyneuropathy  within  the  peripheral  nerve  system  with  an  assumed  autoimmune-
mediated  pathogenesis.  Its  presentation 
is  heterogeneous,  and  the  clinical,  serological,  and 
electrophysiologic  diagnostic  procedures  have  limitations.  The  probable  autoimmune  nature  of  the 
condition is most strongly suggested by response to various immunotherapies. This assumption is further 
supported  by  the  fact  that  the  histology  of  active  lesions  is  characterized  by  endoneurally  located 
inflammatory  mediators,  deposits  of  complement  and  infiltrates  of  T-cells,  and  macrophage-associated 
demyelination.  Patients  with  CIDP  have  symmetrical  weakness  in  both  proximal  and  distal  muscles  that 
worsens progressively. The condition is usually associated with impaired sensation, absent or diminished 
tendon  reflexes,  an  elevated  cerebrospinal  fluid  protein  level,  and  changes  in  electrophysiology 
parameters. Nerve biopsy specimens are characterized by signs of demyelination. The clinical course can 
be relapsing or chronic and progressive, the former being much more common in young adults. 
CIDP is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of about 1.6 to 8.9 per 100,000 adults and about 0.5 
per 100,000 children. 
Primary  treatment  modalities  for  CIDP  include  intravenous  immunoglobulins  (IVIGs)  and  plasma 
exchange, for which there is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evidence. In addition, despite 
less  definitive  published  evidence  of  efficacy,  corticosteroids  are  also  considered  as  first-line  therapy 
because  of  their  long  history  of  use.  Studies  have  failed  to  demonstrate  a  difference  in  efficacy  among 
these 3 treatments; consequently, the choice is usually based on availability, cost, and side-effect profile. 
Another therapy option for CIDP is the subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of IgG. 
In the last years, possible prognostic biomarkers for CIDP have been discussed: Antibodies against NF155 
(Neurofascin-155)  were  found  in  subgroups  of  CIDP  patients  and  correlated  with  a  more  severe 
phenotype  of  disease,  younger  age  at  onset,  ataxia,  CNS  demyelination  and  poor  response  to  IVIG 
treatment.  The  presence  of  antibodies  against  CNTN1  (Contactin-1)  characterized  subgroups  of  CIDP 
patients  with  an  acute  and  aggressive  symptom  onset,  poor  response  to  IVIG  treatment  but  positive 
response  to  corticosteroids.  Both  autoantibodies  could  possibly  serve  as  biomarkers  to  guide  treatment 
option and therapy decision, if they were fully validated. 
Rationale for the proposed change:  
According  to  international  guidelines  [eg,  Joint  Task  Force  of  the  European  Federation  of  Neurological 
Societies (EFNS) and the Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS), 2010], IVIG products have become established 
in the treatment of sensory and motor CIDP (recommendation level A). SCIG is an alternative treatment 
option for CIDP that allows patients to self-administer the product in the home setting. As demonstrated 
for  SCIG  treatment  of  primary  immune  deficiency,  many  patients  prefer  treatment  at  home  to  IVIG

treatment  in  the  hospital. SCIG  treatment  increases autonomy,  quality  of life, and  may  reduce  costs  by 
less hospitalization. In addition, and in contrast to IVIG, serum IgG peak levels are lower and troughs are 
higher with SCIG; thus, a more constant IgG level is achieved, leading to a reduction in the wearing-off 
effect  at  the  end  of  an  IV  treatment  cycle.  SCIG  also  results  in  an  improved  side-effect  profile,  with  a 
lower rate of systemic reaction observed in SCIG studies in PID and does not require venous access that 
can be associated with complications. Several published trials and cases indicate the benefits of SCIG as a 
treatment of CIDP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK Study IgPro20_3003  
PK  (IgG)  samples  in  Study  IgPro20_3003  were  collected  at  SC  Weeks  9,  17  and  at  completion  visit; 
efficacy  (INCAT  score)  was  collected  at  SC  Weeks  1,  2,  5,  9,  13,  17,  21  and  at  completion  visit.  IgG 
concentrations  were  analysed  by  immunoturbidimetry.  Serum  IgG  concentrations  were  summarized  by 
visit using descriptive statistics. 
Summary of the study design: 
Pre-randomization Phase:  
A  total  of  276  subjects  were  screened,  245  entered  the  IVIG  withdrawal  period,  and  208  entered  the 
IgPro10  restabilization  period.  Of  these,  207  subjects  started  treatment  with  IgPro10  and  171  achieved 
CIDP stability. 
Post-randomization Phase:  
A  total  of  172  subjects  were  randomized  and  started  treatment  with  IgPro20  /  placebo  in  the  SC 
treatment  period  (placebo:  57;  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20:  57;  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20:  58  subjects).  A  total  of  76 
subjects  were  withdrawn  (placebo:  36;  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20:  21;  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20:  19  subjects)  and  60 
subjects received IgPro10 as rescue medication.  
IgPro10 restabilization Period:  
Pre-infusion  serum  IgG  concentration  increased  by a  mean  (SD)  of  19.27  (5.854)  g/L  after the  IgPro10 
loading  dose  (2  g/kg  bw  within  2  to  5  days).  At  the  next  visit  (Week  4),  serum  IgG  concentration 
decreased  but  was  still  increased  by  a  mean  (SD)  of  5.38  (4.130)  g/L  as  compared  to  the  start  of  the 
loading dose administration. The IgG concentration declined slightly over time.  
SC Treatment Period (IgPro20 / Placebo):  
Compared  with  the  baseline  mean  (SD)  concentration  (16.3  [3.20]  g/L  for  all  subjects),  the  mean  (SD) 
IgG  concentration  at  the  last  post-dose  observation  decreased  by  4.39  (3.40)  g/L  in  the  placebo  group 
and by 0.89 (2.84) g/L in the 0.2 g/kg group, and increased by 4.11 (2.70) g/L in the 0.4 g/kg group.

Population PK Model and Model Evaluation 
Pooled PK data set 
A  population  approach  was  used  for  the  description  of  the  PK  of  IgG  after  SC  administration  of  IgPro20 
because of the sparse sampling in study 3003. A previously developed population PK model for IVIG was 
updated  with  collected  SCIG  data.  The  thereby  derived  population  PK  model  for  subjects  with  CIDP  was 
developed based on the pooled observed serum IgG concentrations collected in Study IgPro20_3003 and 
Study IgPro10_3001 (IV administration).  
IgPro10_3001 was a single-arm study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of IgPro10 in the treatment 
of  subjects  with  CIDP.  IgPro10  was  given  at  2  g/kg  as  a  loading  dose  for  naïve  subjects,  followed  by  a 
maintenance  dose  at  1  g/kg  every  3  weeks  for  24  weeks.  In  Study  IgPro10_3001,  PK  (IgG)  were 
collected before and after infusion at Day 1, Days 2 to 5 (whenever infusions took place), and at Weeks 
7, 13, 19, and at completion visit (Week 25). 
PK  data  were  pooled  from  235  subjects  to  derive  the  definite  pooled  PK  data  set  of  in  total  1558 
observations resulting from sparse sampling.

Final population PK model structure and results 
A  2-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (for  SC  administration)  and  elimination  and  inter-
individual variability (IIV) on clearance (CL) and central volume of distribution (V2) was selected as final 
model.  The  existing  model  (based  on  IV  data)  was  used  as  a  starting  point  and  the  choice  of  2-
compartmental  structure  confirmed.  The  necessity/benefit  of  including  pre-treatment  information  was 
evaluated.  Various  approaches  to  describe  physiological  baseline  IgG  levels  were  tested.  Using  the 
observed  baseline  as  covariate  stabilized  the  model  and  led  to  significant  improvements  of  parameter 
precision. Owing to the limited sampling in the absorption phase, the absorption rate constant (Ka) was 
not  estimable  based  on  the  current  data,  and  was  therefore  set  to  a  previously  estimated  value.  The 
residual  error  structure  was  proportional.  The  estimates  (95%  CIs)  of  the  population  PK  parameters  in 
subjects  with  CIDP  for  the  reference  covariate  effect  of  82  kg  (ie,  the  median  body  weight  of  the  235 
subjects  in  the  pooled  PK dataset)  were:  0.453  (0.431,  0.474)  L/day  for  clearance,  4.69  (4.38,  5.01)  L 
for  volume  of  distribution.  Relative  bioavailability  of  the  SC  formulation  compared  to  intravenous  (IV) 
administration  was  estimated  to  approx.  85%  (0.824  (0.759,  0.889)).  Estimates  for  the  base  and  final 
model are listed below.

Model simulations 
Based on these estimates, the following steady-state PK parameters for serum IgG after administration of 
IgPro20  (SC  weekly  dose  of  0.2  g/kg  or  0.4  g/kg)  during  maintenance  therapy  were  derived  in  a 
simulated population of subjects with CIDP.  
In  comparison,  trough  serum  IgG  concentrations  and  changes  from  baseline  associated  with  SC 
administration of IgPro20 or placebo are listed in the table below.

Exposure  coverage  for  all  tested  alternative  SC  dosing  regimens  (bi-weekly,  twice  weekly  and  daily 
administration  of  the  same  total  weekly  dose)  was  equivalent,  i.e.,  exposure  parameter  ratios  were 
between 0.8 and 1.25. 
0.2 g/kg/week 
0.4 g/kg/week 
These  results  indicate  that  IgG  exposure  with  IgPro20  dosing  frequencies  ranging  from  once  daily  to 
biweekly  (every  2  weeks)  would  yield  similar  IgG  exposures  if  the  total  weekly  dose  of  the  regimens 
remains the same:

transition period and beyond. A switch from the IV regimen to 0.4 g/kg qw SC showed a gradual rise of 
IgG  concentrations  to  a  new  SS  (Cmax  22.2  g/L,  Cmin  20.4  g/L)  over  a  period  of  approximately  2 
months, after which the new SS was established.

days  in  dose  cohort  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20,  respectively.  Analogously,  the  mean  (95%  CI)  absolute 
bioavailability of SC administered IgPro20 relative to IV administered IgPro10 was estimated to be 82% 
(76%, 89%). The absorption constant was fixed to the value of 0.439 1/day and has been estimated in 
the base model to 0.143 (0.008 – 0.277) 1/day. 
Distribution:  The  Population-PK  derived  estimated  mean  (95%  CI)  central  volume  of  distribution  of 
IgPro20 in study IgPro20_3003 was 4.69 (4.38 - 5.01) L. Peripheral volume of distribution was estimated 
to 1.87 (1.29 – 2.45) L.  
Elimination:  The  elimination  of  IgG  occurs  mostly  via  intracellular  catabolism,  after  fluid-phase  or 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Because neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expression in vascular endothelium 
and in various other organs and tissues is limited, FcRn-mediated recycling is capacity-limited. The mean 
(95% CI) clearance of IgPro20 was estimated to be 0.453 (0.431, 0.474) L/day. 
Special populations 
Covariate analysis 
The following table provides a statistical summary of continuous covariates in the population PK data set. 
No correlations between evaluated continuous covariates were observed. 
Descriptive  statistics  of  categorical  covariates  are  presented  below.  Japanese  subjects  had  a  lower 
median  body  weight  and  age,  and  a  higher  median  baseline  IgG  value  than  non-Japanese  subjects. 
Female subjects had a lower median body weight than males, and Baseline IgG values were slightly lower 
in treatment-naïve subjects than in pre-treated subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018

Available covariates included body weight, age, sex, baseline IgG, IgG pre-treatment, Japanese vs  non-
Japanese, and United States (US) resident vs non-US resident. An automated forward inclusion followed 
by  backward  elimination  procedure  was  applied  using  the  stepwise  covariate  model  (SCM)  tool  as 
implemented in PsN. The results after backward elimination are given in the following Table. 
Among  the  covariates  evaluated  in  the  population  PK  analysis,  only  body  weight  influenced  the  PK  of 
serum  IgG  after  IgPro20  administration.  Age,  sex,  and  region  (US,  Japan,  Rest  of  World)  had  no 
statistically significant or clinically meaningful effects.  
Body weight 
Body  weight  has  been  identified  as  significant  covariate  on  CL  and  V  and  was  introduced  in  the  final 
model as covariate on CL, Q, V2 and V3.  
Sex 
Covariate  effect  of  sex  on  central  volume  lead  to  a  change  <  20%  in  V2  and  thus  was  not  considered 
clinically relevant. Besides, sex was identified to be correlated with body weight. Sex was not included as 
covariate in the final model. 
Baseline IgG 
The  baseline  IgG  effect  on  CL,  though  significant,  was  mainly  driven  by  extreme  baseline  values  that 
were  atypical  for  CIDP  subjects  (<5  g/L  or  >20  g/L).  Baseline  IgG  effect  on  CL  is  depicted  below.  The 
applicant decided not to retain Baseline IgG as covariate in the final population PK model.  
Age 
No formal PK study was conducted in elderly subjects. Subjects < 18 years were not eligible to enter the 
study of IgPro20. In Study 3003, 57 subjects (27.5%) of the 172 CIDP patients were ≥ 65 years of age 
(34/57  subjects  have  been  treated  with  Hizentra).  The  data  from  these  subjects  were  included  in  the 
population PK analysis. Age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of IgG.

The covariate categories “treatment-naïve” and “Japanese” contained only 15 subjects each, limiting the 
ability to interpret these effects. However, both were not found to be significant on clearance and central 
volume of distribution. 
By incorporation of covariate effects on CL and V (only BW-related effects), unexplained IIV (%CV) for CL 
was reduced by 7% for CL and 6% for V2 compared to the base model.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic modelling 
The  relationship  between  systemic  IgG  exposures  and  Total  Inflammatory  Neuropathy  Cause  and 
Treatment  scale  (INCAT)  scores  was  assessed  using  a  longitudinal  population-based  exposure-response 
(ER) analysis with data from 171 subjects with CIDP (1250 observations) who were treated with IgPro20 
in the post-randomization Phase of  Study 3003. The total INCAT scores over time, stratified by IgPro20 
dose groups are depicted below. 
The final model form was: 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 18/55 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
With the final model estimates listed below: 
The key parameter estimates from the final model included an exposure Emax of 2.27, corresponding to 
an  infinite  dose,  and  a  half-maximal  effective  concentration  (EC50)  for  exogenous  IgG  of  5.37  g/L. 
Observed and predicted total INCAT scores over time and stratified by dose groups are depicted below as 
visual predictive check plot. 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 19/55 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The  model  simulation  demonstrated  that  higher  serum  IgG  trough  concentrations  resulted  in  a  greater 
probability  of  having  a  stable  (no  change)  or  decreased  (improvement)  Total  Inflammatory  Neuropathy 
Cause and treatment (INCAT) score.  The probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score 
over  a  range  of  serum  IgG  concentrations  (baseline-corrected)  ranging  from  0  (analogous  to  no 
treatment) to 30 g/L is depicted below.  
Target baseline-corrected IgG concentrations were identified where 20% (EC20), 50% (EC50), and 80% 
(EC80)  of  the  clinically  meaningful  Emax  would  be  expected.  The  model  simulation  estimated  that  the 
baseline-corrected IgG concentrations that would result in an EC20, EC50, and EC80 of the probability of 
having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score would occur at baseline-corrected IgG concentrations of 
0.8 g/L, 2.8 g/L, and 8.1 g/L, respectively. 
The Emax was defined as the probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score at a baseline-
corrected  IgG  concentration  of  30  g/L  (corresponding  to  a  probability  of  approximately  92%).  The 
probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score with no treatment was approximately 64%. 
These baseline-corrected target IgG concentrations (0.8 g/L, 2.8 g/L, and 8.1  g/L) were then compared 
with the expected baseline-corrected IgG trough (at the end of the weekly dosing interval) concentrations 
after  SC  administration  of  IgPro20  at  a  dose  of  0.2  g/kg  or  0.4  g/kg.  The  predicted  baseline-corrected 
mean trough concentration was 3.82 g/L for the 0.2 g/kg dose and 7.54 g/L for the 0.4 g/kg dose. These 
corresponding  IgG  trough  concentrations  would  yield  probability  estimates  of  having  a  stable  or 
decreased Total INCAT score of 81% for the 0.2 g/kg dose and 86% for the 0.4 g/kg dose. 
Based on this analysis, the proportion of subjects with CIDP that would achieve baseline-corrected serum 
IgG concentrations above these targets (EC20, EC50, and EC80) at trough for the 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg 
doses of IgPro20 were calculated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 20/55 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The  simulations  indicate  that  both  doses  of  IgPro20  SC  would  achieve  serum  IgG  concentrations  that 
exceed  the  EC50  (2.8  g/L)  at  trough,  specifically  96%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  minimum 
(trough) concentrations at steady-state (Ctrough) above the EC50 after receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC 
dose  of  0.4  g/kg,  and  72%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  Ctrough  concentrations  above  the  EC50 
after receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.2 g/kg. In addition, the ER model was used to compare 
the probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score after SCIG treatment with IgPro20 (at 
the  weekly  doses  of  0.2 g/kg  and  0.4  g/kg  investigated in  Study  3003)  with the  probability of  having  a 
stable  or  decreased  Total  INCAT  score  after  IVIG  treatment  with  IgPro10  every  3  weeks  at  a  dose  of  1 
g/kg, representative of an approved IVIG treatment regimen for CIDP: 
A  higher  probability  (86%)  of  having  a  stable  of  decreased  Total  INCAT  score  was  predicted  for  the 0.4 
g/kg SC dose of IgPro20 as a result of the higher IgG trough concentrations obtained relative to the low 
SC dose of IgPro20 (81%) and the IV dose of IgPro10.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK  modelling  and  simulation  have  previously  been performed  and  successfully  concluded  for  Hizentra  in  
the  past  and  this  allowed  for  two-weekly  doing  and  frequent  dosing  of  more  than  once  a  week.  These 
variations  applied  to  the  PID/SID  population,  in  whom  dosing  is  generally  lower  than  in  autoimmune 
disorders such as CIDP.  
The PK of IgG after SC administration of IgPro20 was described using a population approach because of 
the sparse sampling in Study IgPro20_3003 (0.2 g/kg, 0.4 g/kg SC QW).This was considered acceptable 
by  CHMP.    A  previously  developed  population  PK  model  for  IV  administered  IgG  was  updated  with  SC 
data.  PK  data  were  pooled  from  235  subjects  to  derive  the  definite  pooled  PK  data  set  of  in  total  1558 
observations  resulting  from  both  studies,  IgPro10_3001  (IV,  N  =28)  and  IgPro20_3003  (IV  &  SC,  N 
=207).  
A  2-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (for  SC  administration)  and  elimination  and  inter-
individual  variability  (IIV)  on  clearance  (CL)  and  central  volume  of  distribution  (V2)  was  selected  to 
describe SC PK data. Due to limited sampling in the absorption phase, the absorption rate constant (Ka) 
could not properly be estimated based on the current data and instead, literature references were used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 21/55 
 
  
  
 
 
 
As  requested  by  the  CHMP,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  provided  showing  that varying  ka  values  over  the 
range  0.05  –  0.6  has  only  minor  influence  on  the  objective  function  values  and  consequently  also  on 
trough  concentrations in the steady state. This mirrors the poor identifiability of ka and in turn the low 
quantitative predictive power. Thus, the choice of the more robust literature-based value is acceptable. It 
is  agreed  that  differences  in  ka  between  PID  and  CIDP  patients  are  not  expected.  Due  to  the  above 
mentioned reasons the model is not qualified to detect possible differences in ka. 
Diagnostic  plots  and  VPC  plots  showed  that  the  PK  of  IgG  following  IV  and  SC  administration  was  in 
general  well  characterized.  Relating  observed  and  predicted  values  showed  an  over-estimation  of  small 
values, high values are slightly over-predicted on the individual level, however, these are not considered 
substantial.  
The  estimates  (95%  CIs)  of  the  population  PK  parameters  were:  0.453  (0.431,  0.474)  L/day  for 
clearance, 4.69 (4.38, 5.01) L for the central volume and 1.87 (1.29, 2.45) L for the peripheral volume of 
distribution.  Relative  bioavailability  of  the  SC  formulation  compared  to  intravenous  administration  was 
estimated to approx. 85% (0.824 (0.759, 0.889)). 
Body weight had a significant impact on both IgG CL and V2. By incorporation of covariate effects (only 
BW-related effects), unexplained IIV (%CV) for CL (28 %CV) was reduced by 7% and by 6% for V2 (23 
%CV) compared to the base model.  
Based  on  the  final  model  estimates,  the  following  steady-state  PK  parameters  for  serum  IgG  after 
administration  of  IgPro20  (SC  weekly  dose  of  0.2  g/kg  or  0.4  g/kg,  6  months)  during  maintenance 
therapy were derived after switching from IV regimen to SC in subjects with CIDP. 
While the 0.2 g/kg SC qw dose level (trough levels) stayed almost unchanged at the SS after standard IV 
administration  (Cmax  17.4  g/L,  Cmin  16.5  g/L),  simulations  of  0.4  g/kg  SC  qw  dosing  resulted  in  a 
gradual rise of IgG concentrations to a slightly higher SS level over approximately 2 months (Cmax 22.2 
g/L, Cmin 20.4 g/L). This  is in accordance with the  data collected from SC treatment period: Compared 
with  the  Baseline  mean  (SD)  concentration  (16.3  [3.20]  g/L  for  all  subjects),  the  mean  (SD)  IgG 
concentration at the last post-dose observation decreased by 4.39 (3.40) g/L in the placebo group and by 
0.89  (2.84)  g/L  in  the  0.2  g/kg  group,  and  increased  by  4.11  (2.70)  g/L  in  the  0.4  g/kg  group.  In  the 
placebo group IgG Ctrough values decline after approx. Week 10. Thus, the carry-over effect of IVIG to 
IgPro 20 could also be estimated to last this length of time.  
Model-based simulations indicate that flexible SC dosing scenarios (bi-weekly, weekly, twice-weekly and 
daily administration) would lead to equivalent exposure. A switch from the established IV regimen to one 
of  proposed  SC  weekly  dose  levels  (0.2  g/kg,  0.4  g/kg)  would  achieve  comparable  trough  IgG 
concentration  levels  with  slightly  higher  level  in  the  steady  state  regarding  the  0.4  g/kg  SC  dosing 
regimen. 
In conclusion, the derived population PK model described the PK of IgPro20 for SC use acceptably well.  
PK/PD 
The  pharmacodynamics  IgPro20  effect  was  described  by  an  Emax  model  that  relates  exogenous  IgG 
concentration  with  INCAT  score  changes  observed.  Data,  population  based  PK  analysis  and  simulation 
indicate  that  there  is  a  dose-response  relations  with  regard  to  efficacy.  Weekly  dosing  of  0.4  g/kg  SC 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 22/55 
 
  
  
 
 
resulted in a more pronounced change from baseline and higher Ctrough IgG values as compared to 0.2 
g/kg dosing. Exposure-efficacy response was described by an Emax model; however the EC50 value could 
not be estimated precisely.   
Model-based  simulations  indicate  that  both  doses  of  IgPro20  achieve  serum  IgG  concentrations  that 
exceed  the  EC50  (2.8  g/L).  Specifically  96%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  minimum  (trough) 
concentrations at steady-state above the EC50 after receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.4 g/kg, 
and  72%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  Ctrough  concentrations  above  the  EC50  after  receiving 
IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.2 g/kg. Only 4% of the patients would achieve Ctrough above the EC80 
(8.1 g/L) in the 0.2 g/kg group, but 44% of the patients that have been dosed with 0.4 g/kg SC.  
Analogously, a higher probability (86%) of having a stable of decreased Total INCAT score is expected for 
the 0.4 g/kg SC dose of IgPro20 as a result of the higher IgG trough concentrations obtained relative to 
the low SC dose of IgPro20 (81%) and the IV dose of IgPro10. 
In conclusion, as diagnostic plots regarding the population PK as well as for the PK-PD model indicate that 
precise  quantitative  predictions  based  on  these  models  might  be  biased,  nevertheless,  data  and  model 
indicate  a  relationship  between  dose/exposure  and  efficacy  that  is  in  favour  of  the  0.4  g/kg  SC  dosing 
regimen.

Treatments 
IVIG during pre-study/screening: Subjects received their last IVIG during Pre-study / Screening (before 
amendment 3) or after Screening eligibility determination (after amendment 3) before the start of the 
IVIG Withdrawal Period. Subjects received their regular / required non-study IVIG. Any locally available 
IVIG was used. The dosage was the same dosage the subject usually received or the dose the subject 
required by judgment of the Treating Physician. 
IVIG withdrawal period: No IVIG was administered during the IVIG Withdrawal Period (for other 
medication see “Concomitant Medication” below). 
IgPro10 during IgPro10 restabilization period: Eligible subjects were treated with the IVIG product 
IgPro10, administered as follows: 
• 
1 loading dose of 2 g/kg bw, administered over 2 to 5 consecutive days (in Japan: dose was given 
over 5 days), with a maximum of 1 g/kg bw on a single day, followed by 
3  or  4  maintenance  doses  (depending  on  the  time  needed  for  restabilization)  of  1  g/kg  bw  given 
every 3 weeks over 1 or 2 consecutive days. Maintenance treatment was given at Weeks 4, 7, and 
10 (and Week 13, if needed). 
• 
Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  CIDP  stability  (i.e.  CIDP  status  did  not  show  a  clinically  meaningful 
difference  during  the  last  2  visits.  In  addition,  to  be  considered  CIDP  stable,  the  CIDP  status  had  to 
recover back to at least the status at Screening, as assessed by adjusted INCAT score) during the last 2 
visits (either Weeks 7 and 10 or Weeks 10 and 13) were discontinued and not randomized. 
SC treatment period with IgPro20 or placebo: The SC treatment dose with IgPro20 or placebo was based 
on body weight, and eligible subjects were randomized to weekly SC infusions for 24 weeks to 1 of the 
following 3 treatment groups: 
• IgPro20 at 0.2 g/kg bw. 
• IgPro20 at 0.4 g/kg bw. 
• Placebo (2% human albumin solution). 
The dose was administered once a week in 2 infusion sessions conducted on 1 or 2 consecutive day(s). 
Rescue medication with IgPro10: Subjects who experienced CIDP relapse (i.e. an increase of ≥ 1 point in 
adjusted  INCAT  score  compared  to  Baseline)  during  the  SC  Treatment  Period  were  withdrawn  from 
further  SC  treatment  and  were  offered  IgPro10  as  rescue  treatment  within  1  week  of  CIDP  relapse 
determination. Before any rescue therapy was administered, all assessments were performed. 
Rescue treatment with IgPro10 included:

• 
• 
1 loading dose of 2 g/kg bw, administered over 2 to 5 consecutive days (in Japan: dose was given 
over 5 days), with a maximum of 1 g/kg bw on a single day, followed by: 
A maximum of 4 maintenance doses of 1 g/kg bw given every 3 weeks over 1 or 2 consecutive days, 
depending on the time needed to return to Baseline INCAT score. 
INCAT score was assessed before the subsequent IgPro10 maintenance dose. If the INCAT score had 
improved (i.e., the INCAT score returned back to or below the Baseline score), IgPro10 was administered 
and Completion Visit tasks were performed. 
If INCAT score had not improved, another maintenance dose was administered and INCAT was assessed 
according to above-mentioned procedure at the next visit scheduled 3 weeks later. 
If  INCAT  score  had  not  improved  after  4  maintenance  doses  of  IgPro10,  Completion  Visit  tasks  were 
performed and further treatment was at the discretion of the Treating Physician. 
Concomitant medication: Concomitant CIDP treatments eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate 
corticosteroids (maintenance dose ≤ 20 mg), topical and inhaled corticosteroids, or topical 
immunosuppressants were permitted, provided that their dose and frequency were kept stable during the 
whole study and were stable during the 3 months before enrolment.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects who had CIDP relapse during the SC 
Treatment Period or were withdrawn from SC treatment for any reason. 
CIDP relapse was defined as follows: 
An increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted INCAT score compared with Baseline, excluding an increase in INCAT 
score of 1 point if this is only due to an increase of the arm score from 0 to 1 (not clinically meaningful 
worsening) or an unchanged adjusted INCAT score compared with Baseline where the arm score 
decreased from 1 to 0 (not clinically meaningful improvement) and the leg score increased by 1 point 
(clinically meaningful worsening). 
Secondary Endpoints 
Efficacy: 
•  Changes in means during SC Treatment Period between groups in (i) INCAT score, (ii) maximum grip 
strength (dominant/non-dominant hand), (iii) MRC sum score, and (iv) R-ODS.

Safety: 
•  Rate of AEs per infusion during the SC Treatment Period, grouped by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). 
•  Number and percentage of subjects with AEs during the SC Treatment Period, grouped by MedDRA, 
SOC and PT. 
Efficacy of IgPro10 and IgPro20 was assessed on the basis of the following variables: 
• 
INCAT score. 
•  R-ODS score. 
•  Mean grip strength. 
•  MRC sum score (8 muscle groups). 
•  Electrophysiology parameters: distal and proximal latencies, Compound action potential (CMAP) 
amplitudes, nerve conduction velocities, and conduction block in 3 motor nerves (SC Treatment Period 
only) 
Safety was assessed on the basis of the following variables recorded during the study: 
•  AEs. 
•  Laboratory safety parameters (haematology and serum chemistry). 
•  Vital signs. 
•  Physical examination. 
•  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (Japan only) 
Sample size 
Pre-randomization IVIG withdrawal period: 245 subjects

Randomisation 
During  the  double-blind  SC  treatment  period,  randomization  to  0.2  g/kg  bw  IgPro20,  0.4  g/kg  bw 
IgPro20,  or  placebo  was  controlled  centrally  by  the  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS)  / 
Interactive  Web  Response  System  (IWRS).  Randomization  was  stratified  by  region  (Japan  versus  non-
Japan) to ensure that the treatments were evenly distributed among the subgroup of Japanese patients. 
Blinding (masking) 
All subjects and study personnel were blinded to IgPro20/placebo treatment. Standard measures were 
taken for the 2 doses of IgPro20 and placebo to ensure adequate blinding of the investigational product. 
In addition, the investigators and subjects were blinded to the randomized treatment assignment. In 
addition, the blind was preserved by administration of the same volume for all 3 treatment groups 
(subjects randomized to 0.2 g/kg bw IgPro20 received 1 session of IgPro20 and 1 session of placebo, 
randomly selected, each week.) To minimize potential unblinding, a 2-physician approach (Treating 
Physician / Evaluating Physician) was used. The results of immunoglobulin concentration assessments 
remained blinded until post-database lock. For the planned interim analysis and ongoing risk-benefit 
evaluations, members of the IDMC were unblinded. Access to study documents containing information on 
IgG concentrations and treatment groups was restricted to ensure that no person involved in operations, 
analysis, or management of the study was unblinded.

Statistical methods 
Study IgPro20_3003 is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study. The 
study  has  three  arms;  a  low-dose,  a  high-dose,  and  a  placebo  arm  with  57,  58,  and  57  subjects 
randomized  respectively  (planned  with  the  sample  size  calculation  according  to  study  protocol  were  58 
subjects each).  
The study was powered to demonstrate that at least the high dose of IgPro20 is superior to placebo with 
regard to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
A monotonic dose-response was expected for the primary endpoint, with placebo ≥ IgPro20 low dose ≥ 
IgPro20  high  dose  and  with  at  least  1  strict  inequality  among  the  2  non-strict  inequalities.  This  means 
that if the null hypothesis was rejected, the primary efficacy endpoint would have a statistically significant 
higher result for placebo than for at least 1 of the investigated doses. 
Based  on  the  (recalculated)  results  from  the  ICE  study  extension  period  [Hughes  et  al,  2008;  Hughes, 
2009],  it  was  assumed  that  the  percentages  of  subjects  who  would  relapse  during  SC  treatment  were 
35%  for  the  IgPro20  high  dose,  52%  for  the  IgPro20  low  dose,  and  65%  for  placebo.  Further  it  was 
assumed that 60% of subjects were randomized under protocol amendment 3 or later. 
The  proportion  of  IVIG-independent  subjects  included  in  the  study  was  assumed  to  be  15%.  It  was 
further  assumed  that  these  subjects  would  have  a  relapse  rate  of  10%  regardless  of  the  treatment.  A 
discontinuation rate of 15% due to other reasons than CIDP relapse in the placebo group and 10% in the 
IgPro20  treatment  groups  after  implementation  of  amendment  3  was  included  in  the  calculation  of  the 
relapse rates. 
The exact CA trend test with equally spaced scores was used for the purpose of sample size calculation. 
With  a  1-sided  significance  level  of  2.5%,  a  sample  size  of  58  was  needed  in  each  treatment  group  to 
achieve  a  power  of  approximately  90%  in  the  ITT  analysis  based  on  the  above  assumptions.  Thus,  the 
overall planned sample size was 174 subjects treated either with IgPro20 or placebo. Approximately 350 
subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  to  ensure  that  174  subjects  would  be  treated  with  IgPro20  or 
placebo.

Recruitment 
A  total  of  172  subjects  were  randomized  and  started  treatment  with  IgPro20  /  placebo  in  the  SC 
Treatment Period of the Post-randomization Phase. A total of 57 subjects received placebo; of these, 36 
subjects  were  withdrawn  (CIDP  relapse:  32  subjects,  withdrawal  by  subject:  3  subjects,  physician 
decision:  1  subject).  A  total  of  57  subjects  received  0.2  g/kg  bw  IgPro20;  of  these,  21  subjects  were 
withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 18 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 2 subjects, adverse event [AE]: 1 subject). 
A total of 58 subjects received 0.4 g/kg bw IgPro20; of these, 19 subjects were withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 
10  subjects,  withdrawal  by  subject:  8  subjects,  AE:  1  subject).  The  demographic  and  primary  disease 
characteristics of the ITTS were balanced across the treatment groups, except for sex: there were more 
male subjects in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group (42 subjects [73.7%]) than in the 0.4 g/kg  IgPro20 group 
(31 subjects [53.4%]). In the placebo group, 37 subjects (64.9%) were male. All subjects received prior 
treatment  with  immunoglobulins  before  enrolment.  There  was  no  dose-related  pattern  in  the  use  of 
concomitant medication.

Protocol amendments

The following two important changes were implemented: 
(1)  The  IVIg  withdrawal  phase  was  modified  to  an  IgG  dependency  test  and  additional  deterioration 
criteria  were  implemented  as  described  above.  Fulfillment  on  one  of  these  criteria,  in  the  event  of  an 
unchanged INCAT score, qualified the patient to move to the next study phase (Amendment 3). Relapse 
rates in the IgPro20 groups were anticipated to increase after this change due to the fact that significant 
decrease  in  grip  strength  (i.e.,  8-point  deterioration)  is  not  always  accompanied  by  a  corresponding 
worsening  in  adjusted  INCAT  score  by  1  point.  To  correct  for  the  new  assumptions  for  relapse 
percentages  underlying  the  power  calculation,  the  sample  size  was  increased  from  150  to  174,  and  the 
screening  numbers  were  increased  from  250  to  350.  The  underlying  assumptions  were  that  90  %  of 
subjects would be recruited after Amendment 3 and the dropout rates for placebo subjects would increase 
to 15 % (while being around 10 % in the active treatment groups). 
(2)  The  length  of  time  required  for  prestudy  IVIg  has  been  reduced  to  8  weeks.  The  change  in  this 
requirement  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  the  outcomes  of  the  SC  treatment  period  because  all 
patients  must  show  IgG  dependency  (up  to  12  weeks)  and  IVIg  restabilization  (up  to  13  weeks)  before 
randomization and start of SC treatment.

In  the  PSDS,  the  median  time  since  CIDP  diagnosis  was  3.0  years  (0.1  to  33.5  years).  A  total  of  185 
subjects  (89.4%)  had  a  definite  CIDP  diagnosis  per  the  EFNS  /  PNS  diagnostic  criteria.  The  mean  (SD) 
INCAT score at Screening was 2.7 (1.67) points. The minimum (0 points) and maximum (8 points) INCAT 
scores show that subjects were affected by the disease to very different degrees. The ITTS and the RSDS 
had  similar  primary  disease  characteristics  as  the  PSDS.  The  primary  disease  characteristics  were 
balanced across treatment groups in the ITTS. In the PSDS, the most frequent SOC recorded in medical 
history was Vascular Disorders (94 subjects, 45.4%), followed by Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue 
Disorders (78 subjects, 37.7%) and Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (72 subjects, 34.8%). The most 
frequent  PT  recorded  in  medical  history  was  Hypertension  (85  subjects,  41.1%),  followed  by 
Hypercholesterolaemia (25 subjects, 12.1%). 
Prior  Treatment  With  Immunoglobulins:  All  subjects  in  the  PSDS  received  prior  treatment  with 
immunoglobulins before enrollment. A total of 56 subjects (27.1%) in the PSDS received at least 1 dose 
of  Privigen  before  enrollment.  The  mean  (SD)  IVIG  dose in  the  3  months  before  Screening  in the  PSDS 
was  2.6  (1.52)  g/kg  bw.  A  similar  result  was  observed  for  the  ITTS,  the  mean  IVIG  dose  was  balanced 
across the treatment groups. 
Prior  Medication  for  CIDP  (Excluding  Treatment  With  Immunoglobulins):  During  the  IVIG  Withdrawal 
Period,  21  (10.1%)  of  the  subjects  in  the  PSDS  received  Glucocorticoids  and  24  (11.6%)  subjects 
received Other Analgesics and Antipyretics that were reported as CIDP medication. A small proportion of 
subjects  (10  subjects,  4.8%)  in  the  PSDS  received prior  medication,  mainly  Glucocorticoids  (6  subjects, 
2.9%), for CIDP other than IgG within a maximum of 6 months before enrollment. Prior medication was 
not analyzed for the ITTS. 
Prior  Medication  (Excluding  Treatment  of  CIDP):  The  most  frequently  used  medications  in  the  PSDS 
during the IVIG Withdrawal Period were Proton Pump Inhibitors (43 subjects, 20.8%), ACE Inhibitors (33 
subjects,  15.9%),  and  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG  CoA)  Reductase  Inhibitors  (30 
subjects, 14.5%). The most frequently used prior medications in the PSDS were Proton Pump Inhibitors 
(5 subjects, 2.4%) and Contact Laxatives (3 subjects, 1.4%). Prior medication was not analyzed for the 
ITTS. 
Numbers analysed 
A  total  of  172  subjects  were  randomized  and  started  treatment  with  IgPro20  /  placebo  in  the  SC 
Treatment Period of the Post-randomization Phase. A total of 57 subjects received placebo; of these, 36

subjects  were  withdrawn  (CIDP  relapse:  32  subjects,  withdrawal  by  subject:  3  subjects,  physician 
decision:  1  subject).  A  total  of  57  subjects  received  0.2  g/kg  bw  IgPro20;  of  these,  21  subjects  were 
withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 18 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 2 subjects, adverse event [AE]: 1 subject). 
A total of 58 subjects received 0.4 g/kg bw IgPro20; of these, 19 subjects were withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 
10 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 8 subjects, AE: 1 subject). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results are given on the ITTS group. The per-protocol analyses of the efficacy data supported the 
overall efficacy results obtained from the ITTS. Study 3003 was considered successful if a superiority of 
at least 1 dose of IgPro20 over placebo was shown. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
CIDP relapse 
During the 24-week post-randomisation period the relapse rate (increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted INCAT 
score compared with baseline) for both IgPro20 doses (0.2 g/kg bw and 0.4 g/kg bw) showed superiority 
over placebo. A statistically significant lower percentage of subjects treated with IgPro20 (32.8% for the 
0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group and 38.6% for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group) had CIDP relapse or were withdrawn for 
other  reasons  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (63.2%).  The  absolute  risk  reduction  was 
24.6% for the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group and 30.4% for the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group compared with placebo.  
Primary endpoint analyses 
Sensitivity analyses A – C were performed as described: 
A = Only considered CIDP relapse based on the adjusted INCAT score (“relapse analysis”). 
B = “Mixed-case analysis”. Subjects with CIDP relapse (including 4 subjects who received rescue 
medication without having had CIDP relapse) and subjects who were withdrawn for taking prohibited 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 33/55 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
medication and subjects who were withdrawn due to physician’s decision were considered relapsers. 
All other subjects were considered non-relapsers. 
C = “Complete-case analysis”. All subjects who were withdrawn for any other reason than CIDP relapse 
were excluded from the analysis; thus, the population included in this analysis was smaller than that 
in the primary endpoint analysis. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Time to CIDP Relapse (or Withdrawal for any Other Reason) 
After  switching  from  the  IgPro10  Restabilization  Period  to  the  randomized  SC  Treatment  Period  with 
IgPro20  /  placebo,  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  rapidly  increasing probability of  CIDP  relapse or 
withdrawal  from  SC  Week  3  onwards.  In  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  the  probability  of  relapse  or 
withdrawal increased above the level of the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group at SC Week 6 and remained higher 
until the end of the SC Treatment Period (Figure E 3). In the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, a gradual increase 
was observed. At Week 25, the probability of CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason was 0.63 
for placebo, 0.39 for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 0.34 for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. 
Time to CIDP Relapse or Withdrawal for any Other Reason 
•  Censored: Subjects who neither relapsed nor withdrew for any other reason were censored at the 
date of their Completion Visit. 
Time to CIDP Relapse 
The probability of CIDP relapse alone increased in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group above the level of the 0.4 
g/kg IgPro20 group at SC Week 4 and remained higher until the end of the SC Treatment Period (Figure E 
4). At Week 25, the probability of CIDP relapse was 0.59 for placebo, 0.35 for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 0.22 
for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20.

group  remained  stable  in  R-ODS  centile  score  during  the  SC  Treatment  Period.  In  the  placebo  group, 
subjects deteriorated from Baseline in all but 7 of the 24 items reflecting activities and social participation 
compared with the IgPro20 dose groups, in which subjects were stable in all but 1 item (“take a shower” 
for the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group).

With regard to sex, more male subjects were included in study IgPro20_3003. Randomization for gender 
was  somewhat  imbalanced.  More  male  subjects  were  included  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  (42 
subjects,  73.7%)  compared  to  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group  (31  subjects  53.4%).  Table  E  12  lists  the

With regard to the subgroup analysis of the elderly population, no significant difference in CIDP relapse or 
withdrawal for any other reason was apparent in patients > 65 years, although numbers are quite low in 
this subgroup and the rate of relapsers in the placebo group was quite low (see table E 13).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study  IgPro20_3003  was  a  phase  3,  prospective,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, 3-arm  study  in  adult  CIDP  patients  with  2  study  phases:  a  Pre-randomization 
Phase  (consisting  of  an  IVIG  Withdrawal  Period  and  an  IgPro10  (Privigen)  Restabilization  Period)  and  a 
Post-randomization  Phase  (consisting  of  a  randomized  placebo-controlled  SC  Treatment  Period  with  2 
doses of IgPro20 (Hizentra) and an IgPro10 Rescue Period). The study is in compliance with the preceding 
initial and follow-up scientific advice. 
Of  276  subjects  screened,  172  were  randomized  to  IgPro20/placebo,  96  subjects  completed  the  study. 
Subjects  were  mostly  withdrawn  due  to  no  CIDP  deterioration  during  Withdrawal  Period  (n=28),  no 
restabilization  during  IgPro10  Restabilization  Period  (n=22)  or  CIDP  relapse  during  Post-randomization 
Phase  (n=60).  In  total,  there  were  28  withdrawals  by  the  subject  concerned  and  3  withdrawals  due  to 
physician decision. During the Pre-randomization Phase 4 subjects and during Post-randomization Phase 
2 subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events. Protocol violations were recorded for 2 subjects during 
Pre-randomization phase which led to subject withdrawal. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across the 3 treatment groups in the ITTS, 
except for sex: there were more male subjects in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group (42 subjects, 73.7%) than 
in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group (31 subjects 53.4%). 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  rate of  CIDP  relapse or  withdrawal  for any  other  reason;  relapse 
was  defined  as  an  increase  of  ≥  1  point  in  adjusted  INCAT  score  compared  to  baseline.  The  higher  SC 
dose of IgPro20 investigated in Study 3003 (0.4 g/kg bw) prevented CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any 
other reason in 67% of subjects, and the lower dose (0.2 g/kg bw) prevented relapse in 61% of subjects, 
whereas only 37% of subjects on placebo remained relapse-free. 
In  general,  analysis  of  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (time  to  CIDP  relapse,  INCAT  score,  R-ODS 
score,  mean  grip  strength,  MRC  sum  score)  and  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  (electrophysiologic 
parameters) revealed efficacy of maintenance treatment with IgPro20 and therefore support the primary 
efficacy endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study IgPro20_3003 proved that maintenance treatment with IgPro20 in both dosing groups significantly 
reduced CIDP relapse rate when compared to placebo (CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason: 
63.2% for placebo vs. 38.6% for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 vs. 32.8% for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20). However, the carry-
over effect of the preceding IVIG treatment with IgPro10 may have exerted an effect for ~ 10 weeks as 
seen by the PK data of the placebo group. This would imply that during the post-randomization treatment 
with  IgPro20  (=24  weeks),  residual  effects  of  the  IgPro10  pre-treatment  cannot  be  excluded.    Thus, 
results from expansion study IgPro20_3004 are important and could offer valuable information on long-
term  efficacy.  Therefore  the  company  was  requested  to  provide  these  data  as  soon  as  available.  A 
restriction if the indication was requested by the CHMP, because of this carry-over effect from IVIG and 
because SCIG alone or stabilisation with some other therapy haven’t been studied. Hizentra is indicated 
for the treatment of patients with CIDP as maintenance therapy after stabilization with IVIg. In addition, 
the CHMP also considered that the age range of the CIDP patients for whom Hizentra is indicated should 
be stated in the indication and this was agreed by the applicant. 
No significant difference between the high and low dose of IgPro20 was observed in study IgPro20_3003. 
However, for the primary efficacy endpoint, no statistical analysis comparing the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group 
with the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group has been provided. The difference in CIDP relapse (excluding withdrawal 
for any other reason) appears to be high enough to reveal a significant difference and patients could thus 
have a greater benefit from treatment with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. This is further supported by the analysis of 
R-ODS centile score, where the outcome in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group was significantly better compared 
to  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group.  Nevertheless,  the  posology  range  given  in  the  PI  is  supported  by  the 
Assessment report

Page 42/55 
 
  
  
 
CHMP, since both low and high dose (0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg) will be made available to patients and the 
treatment with Hizentra will be adjusted in each patient according to their individual response. 
Although  subgroup  analysis  (gender,  age,  region  [United  States,  Japan],  steroid  /  immunosuppressant 
usage)  revealed  no  clinically  relevant  differences  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  CIDP  relapse  rate  in 
female  subjects  on  placebo  (80%)  was  much  higher  compared  to  male  subjects  (54%)  and  treatment 
with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 appeared to be more effective in women (26.7% CIDP relapse) compared to men 
(42.9%  CIDP  relapse)  (see  table  E  12).  Randomization  for  gender  and  dosing  group  is  somewhat 
imbalanced  and  may  explain  some  of  the  differences  observed,  however,  the  numbers  are  too  small  to 
actually draw any meaningful conclusions  
With  regard  to  the  subgroup  analysis  of  the  elderly  population  (>  65  years),  although  no  significant 
difference  in  CIDP  relapse  or  withdrawal  for  any  other  reason  was  apparent  comparing  treatment  with 
IgPro20  vs.  placebo  (p=0.066),  the  same  trend  is  seen  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  IgPro20  as 
compared to the total set. 
Although any non-head-to-head comparison should be viewed with caution due to differing study designs, 
patient populations, and concomitant medications etc. a general overview of the efficacy of Ig in CIDP is 
provided here. IVIG is considered to be established in this indication. From a Cochrane Review analyzing 
IVIG  treatment  in  CIDP,  8  randomized  controlled  trials  including  332  participants  were  eligible  for 
evaluation.  Five  randomized  trials  prove that  intravenous  immunoglobulin  improves  disability  more than 
placebo.  In  the  trials  comparing  IVIg  with  placebo  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  participants 
improved in disability within six weeks after the onset of treatment with IVIg compared with placebo, risk 
ratio (RR) 2.40 (95% CI 1.72 to 3.36) and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 
(NNTB) of 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55). Three other small trials showed no significant difference between 
intravenous  immunoglobulin  and  plasma  exchange,  corticosteroids  or  methylpredisolone.  No  new  trials 
were  found  for  this  2013  update.  In  this  review,  mild  and  transient  side  effects  were  reported  in 
approximately half of treated participants; serious side effects were reported in six per cent of the treated 
participants. This did not differ significantly from plasma exchange or corticosteroids treated participants. 
Whether  the  improvements  are  equally  clinically  relevant  cannot  be  deduced from  this  analysis  because 
each trial used a different disability scale with a unique definition of a significant improvement. Only one 
study  included  in  this  review  had  a  long-term  follow-up.  These  results  suggest  that  intravenous 
immunoglobulin improves disability more than placebo over 24 and 48 weeks. The authors conclude that 
further  research  is  needed  to  compare  the  long-term  benefits  as  well  as  side  effects  of  intravenous 
immunoglobulin with other treatments. 
Study IgPro20_3003 was the first randomized, controlled trial evaluating SCIG in CIDP therapy. For this 
reason,  and  since  this  study  was  designed  to  show  eligibility  for  maintenance  instead  of  primary 
treatment,  comparison  to  other  studies  on  IVIGs  in  CIDP  is  difficult.  Due  to  the  restabilization  criteria, 
subjects  generally  not  responding  to  IVIG  treatment  have  already  been  excluded.  Only  stable  subjects 
were  eligible  for  treatment  with  IgPro20  and  study  IgPro20_3003  aimed  at  showing  disease  stability 
instead of improvement. In other studies, e.g. the ICE study or study IgPro10_3001, subjects had to be 
IVIG-free for at least 3 months or a prior IVIG washout was performed. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study IgPro20_3003 was CIDP relapse based on the INCAT score, which 
corresponds  to  the  primary  endpoint  of  other  IVIG  studies  (e.g.  study  IgPro10_3001  (Privigen)  or  the 
ICE-study  (Gamunex)),  which  analyzed  the  responder  rate  based  on  INCAT  score  points.  Secondary 
efficacy endpoints of study IgPro20_3003 (grip strength, time to relapse, MRC sum score) have also been 
used in other studies on IVIGs in CIDP.  
Study IgPro20_3003 also analyzed subject’s preference for treatment comparing SC to IV treatment. At 
the Last Post-dose Observation, a larger percentage of subjects preferred current SC treatment over pre-
study IV treatment (placebo group: 38.6% versus 24.6%; 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group: 52.6% versus 17.5%; 
0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group:  53.4%  versus  19.0%),  mainly  due  to  feeling  that  SC  treatment  offered 
participating subjects greater independence. 
Overall,  the  efficacy  data  demonstrated  that  IgPro20,  administered  subcutaneously  either  as  low  (0.2 
g/kg)  or  high  (0.4  g/kg)  dose  for  maintenance  treatment  of  CIDP,  effectively  prevented  relapse  of

neuromuscular  disability  and  impairment  in  61.6%  and  67.2%  of  cases,  respectively.  Results  for  CIDP 
relapse  rate  based  on  the  adjusted  INCAT  score  were  further  supported  by  the  secondary  efficacy 
outcome  measures  (time  to  relapse,  INCAT  score,  R-ODS  centile  score,  mean  grip  strength,  MRC  sum 
score) showing CIDP stability in IgPro20 treated subjects. The beneficial outcomes of study IgPro20_3003 
therefore justify a transition from IVIG treatment to SCIG treatment in CIDP. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Results for the primary endpoint show a significant lower CIDP relapse rate (ITTS and PPS population) for 
both 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 maintenance therapy compared to placebo. These results were also 
confirmed  for  three  sensitivity  analyses  performed  on  ITTS  population.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of 
both  IgPro20  study  arms  confirmed  the  primary  endpoint  and  revealed  stable  disease  for  subjects  who 
did not relapse. The originally proposed indication was requested to be amended in order to describe the 
age  group  of  the  treated population (adults,  children  and  adolescents  (0-18  years)).  The  indication  was 
also  narrowed  to  reflect  the  correct  population  suitable  for  treatment,  i.e.  maintenance  therapy  of 
patients with CIDP already stabilised with IVIg.  
With respect to the possible overlapping effect of the preceding IgPro10 treatment it would be beneficial 
to  present  long-term  efficacy  results  from  the  expansion  study  IgPro20_3004  and  the  applicant  was 
requested to provide these data as soon as possible in the post marketing setting. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the post-randomization phase, 57 subjects were administered a total of 1514 infusions with placebo, 
57 subjects were administered a total of 2007 infusions with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 58 subjects were 
administered a total of 2218 infusions with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. Subjects generally used 4 injections sites 
(maximum: 9 sites) and infused an average of 20 mL per site (maximum: 50 mL), with an infusion rate 
of 20 mL/h (maximum: 50 mL/h). The infusion time was approximately 1 hour and the maximum infusion 
volume was 140 mL per infusion session. 
Adverse events 
A total of 21 subjects (36.8%) in the placebo group had 52 AEs, compared with 33 subjects (57.9%) in 
the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  with  158  AEs  and  30  subjects  (51.7%)  in  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group  with 
114 AEs. Most of these AEs were Local Reaction AEs. In the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, 11 subjects (19.3%) 
had 54 Local Reaction AEs (1 subject had 30 Local Reaction AEs), and in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, 17 
subjects (29.3%) had 49 Local Reaction AEs (1 subject had 17 Local Reaction AEs). All Local Reaction AEs 
were  either  mild  (94.5%)  or  moderate  (5.5%)  intensity,  and  the  frequency  decreased  over  time.  Most 
AEs reported in the 3 treatment groups were mild or moderate.

Overview AEs and AE rates 
A total of 19 subjects (33.3%) had 37 causally related and / or temporally associated AEs in the placebo 
group,  compared  with  29  subjects  (50.9%)  with  118  events  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  and  27 
subjects  (46.6%)  with  95  events  in  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group.  A  disproportionately  large  number  of 
causally related and / or temporally associated AEs were reported in 1 subject in each IgPro20 group. In 
the IgPro20 dose groups, the rate of causally related and / or temporally associated AEs per infusion was 
similar for 0.2 g/kg (0.059) and 0.4 g/kg (0.043). 
The majority of causally related and / or temporally associated AEs were Local Reaction AEs. A total of 4 
subjects (7.0%) had 7 causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs in the placebo 
group, compared with 10 subjects (17.5%) with 52 events in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group and 17 subjects 
(29.3%)  with  49  events  in  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group.  Within  the  2  IgPro20  dose  groups,  the  rate  of 
causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs was similar. 
A total of 33 of the 52 causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs in the 0.2 g/kg 
IgPro20  group  were  experienced  by  a  single  subject  (subject  3920037-0002),  as  were  17  of  the  49 
causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event / adverse events of special interest (AESI) / deaths 
Three subjects experienced 7 severe AEs that were reported as SAEs: 
•  Allergic Dermatitis in 1 subject in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group,  
•  Device Related Infection, Bacterial Infection, and Nonunion Fracture in 1 subject in the 0.2 g/kg 
IgPro20 group),  
•  Anaemia, Acute Cholecystitis, and Sepsis in 1 subject in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group. 
In the placebo group, 1 subject had 1 SAE; in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, 3 subjects experienced 5 SAEs 
(1 was causally related and / or temporally associated: Allergic Dermatitis); and in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 
group,  2  subjects  experienced  5  SAEs.  The  outcome  of  all  SAEs  was  recovered  /  resolved,  except  2 
events  experienced  by  the  same  subject  in  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  for  which  the  outcomes  were 
recovered  /  resolved  with  sequelae  (Subject  2500019-0005,  Device  Related  Infection  and  Nonunion 
Fracture). Allergic Dermatitis was the only related SAE that occurred during treatment with IgPro20.

Adverse Events of special interest (AESI): The following AEs related to class effects for IgG products were 
considered  as  AESIs:  Acute  Systemic  Hypersensitivity  Reactions,  Aseptic  Meningitis  Syndrome, 
Haemolysis, and Thrombotic Events. The only AESI reported during the SC Treatment Period was 1 SAE 
of  Allergic  Dermatitis.  The  event  was  experienced  by  Subject  2500019-0002  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20 
group  and  was  assessed  as  causally  related  and  /  or  temporally  associated  with  IgPro20  /  placebo.  The 
outcome  was  recovered  /  resolved.  No  subject  experienced  AEs  of  Haemolysis,  Aseptic  Meningitis 
Syndrome, or Thrombotic Events during the SC Treatment Period. 
There were no deaths during the SC Treatment Period with IgPro20. 
Laboratory findings 
During the SC Treatment Period, 4 subjects (2.3%) had 5 laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs and 
potentially related to hemolysis; however, none of these subjects fulfilled the hemolysis criteria.

All  of  these  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity;  the  majority  was  considered  to  be  not  related  to 
IgPro20 by the investigator and was resolved at the final follow-up. None of these led to discontinuation 
or changed doses of study product, to any other intervention, or to discontinuation from the study. 
At Last Post-dose Observation there was a relevant shift in leukocytes compared to Baseline: 5 subjects 
(8.6%)  had  a  shift  from  normal  to  low  in  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  whereas  no  subjects  had  a  shift 
from normal to low in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group or in the placebo group. 
In group 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, 7 subjects revealed a shift in reticulocytes from normal to high and in group 
0.4 g/kg IgPro20, 4 subjects had a shift in reticulocytes from normal to high.  
There  was  also  a  relevant  shift  recorded  for  LDH:  overall,  7  subjects  had  shifts  from  normal  to  high;  4 
subjects (6.9%) in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, 2 subjects (3.5%) in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, and 1 
subject (1.8%) in the placebo group. 
In  group  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20,  4  subjects  revealed  a  shift  in  haptoglobin  from  normal  to  high  and in  group 
0.4 g/kg IgPro20, 3 subjects had a shift in haptoglobin from normal to high.  
Safety in special populations 
There were no regional effects in the pattern of AEs (US versus non-US and Japan versus non-Japan. No 
PT was experienced by > 2 US subjects or > 1 Japanese subject in any treatment group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One  subject  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  experienced  1  non-serious,  causally  related  and  /  or 
temporally  associated  AE  of  Fatigue  that  led  to  withdrawal  of  the  investigational  product  and  subject 
discontinuation. In the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, 1 subject experienced 3 events leading to withdrawal of 
the  investigational  product  and  subject  discontinuation  (anaemia,  acute  cholecystitis,  and  sepsis).  All  3 
events were also serious. None of them were assessed as causally related and / or temporally associated. 
These 3 SAEs had an outcome of recovered / resolved. 
Post marketing experience 
The post-marketing safety profile of Hizentra for the previously approved indications has been 
characterized during the 7-year post-marketing period. During this period, 38,330,927 g of Hizentra, 
corresponding to 3,833,093 estimated standard doses of 10 g, were distributed. As of 31 May 2016 (Data 
Lock Point [DLP] of last periodic report), a worldwide cumulative total of 9277 post-marketing case 
reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported to CSL Behring’s Pharmacovigilance 
database. Based on these case reports of suspected ADRs and the class effects of Hizentra, the identified 
risks of Hizentra have been established as local reactions including ulceration-like infusion site reactions 
(UL-ISRs), anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis syndrome, and thromboembolic events. The 
potential risks of Hizentra are increased or unknown risks in the home-based SC (self-) administration, 
exacerbation of existing hyperprolinemia (product specific), hemolysis, and transmission of infectious 
agents. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of IgPro20 in maintenance treatment of CIDP was evaluated in 57 subjects treated with 
0.2 g/kg IgPro20 and 58 subjects treated with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. 57 subjects were administered a total of 
2007 infusions with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 58 subjects were administered a total of 2218 infusions with 
0.4 g/kg IgPro20, whereby 33 subjects (58%) experienced at least 1 AE in the 0.2 g /kg IgPro20 group 
and  30  subjects  (52%)  experienced  at  least  1  AE  in  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group.  AEs  were  causally 
related to study drug in 17 subjects (30%, 0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 20 subjects (34.5% 0.4 g/kg IgPro20). 
Assessment report  
EMA/261438/2018 
Page 48/55 
 
  
  
 
 
Temporally associated AEs (within 72 hours) were observed in 29 subjects (51%, 0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 
25 subjects (43%, 0.4 g/kg IgPro20). Based on the amount of infusions administered, the overall AE rate 
per infusion was 0.079 (0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 0.051 (0.4 g/kg IgPro20), the rate of causally related AEs 
per  infusion  was  0.035  (0.2  g/kg  IgPro20)  and  0.029  (0.4  g/kg  IgPro20)  and  the  rate  of  temporally 
associated AEs per infusion was 0.057 (0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 0.040 (0.4 g/kg IgPro20). 
Causally related and/or temporally associated AEs experienced by ≥ 5% of subjects were local reactions, 
headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis and 1 urinary tract infection. Almost all AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. The laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs were mild to moderate in intensity; the majority 
was considered to be not related or unlikely related to study drug, and were resolved at the final follow-
up. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or physical examinations. 
No  deaths  occurred  in  this  study.  In  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  3  subjects  experienced  5  SAEs.  Of 
these,  1  was  causally  related  and  /  or  temporally  associated  to  IgPro20  (Allergic  Dermatitis),  4  were 
considered  not  related  (infection  of  arthrodesis  material  in  the  right  ankle,  nonunion  of  fracture  in  the 
right  foot,  bacteriological  infection  in  the  right  ankle,  arthralgia).  In  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  2 
subjects  had  5  SAEs.  None  of  them  were  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  (2x  Acute  Cholecystitis, 
anaemia,  sepsis,  arthropathy).  Except  for  the  nonunion  of  the  fracture  in  the  right  foot  (resolved  with 
sequelae), all SAEs were recovered/resolved.  
In  total,  2  subjects  had  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation;  1  subject  with  1  event  in  the  0.2  g/kg 
IgPro20 group, and 1 subject with 4 events in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group. 
The only AESI reported during the SC treatment period was 1 event of allergic dermatitis. There was no 
hemolysis, aseptic meningitis syndrome, or thrombotic events during the SC Treatment Period. 
Safety data indicate that both low and high dose IgPro20 were safe and reasonably well tolerated when 
administered s.c. as maintenance treatment to subjects with CIDP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
Results of the main clinical study show a significant lower CIDP relapse rate (ITTS population) for both 
active arms compared to placebo (32.8% for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20, 38.6% for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 63.2% 
for placebo). These results were also confirmed for the PPS population and three sensitivity analyses 
performed on ITTS population. Positive differences between active arms and placebo could also be 
demonstrated for the SC treatment phase for secondary endpoints “Time to CIDP relapse”, “INCAT 
Score”, “R-ODS Centile Score” (Questionnaire), “mean grip strength”, and “MRC Sum Score”. 
Study IgPro20_3003 also showed that a larger percentage of subjects preferred SC treatment over IV 
treatment because SC treatment offered greater independence. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Long-term beneficial effects of maintenance treatment with IgPro20 are not foreseen yet, especially when 
considering  the  overlapping  effects  of  prior  IVIG  treatment.  In  the  placebo  group  IgG  Ctrough  values 
decline after approx. Week 10. Thus, the carry-over effect of IVIG to IgPro 20 could also be estimated to 
last this length of time. Thus, results from expansion study IgPro20_3004 are important and could offer 
valuable long-term data. Therefore the company is requested to provide these data as soon as possible. 
Since the study did not investigate the paediatric population, there is some uncertainty as to the extent of 
beneficial  effects  of  s.c.  treatment  with  IgPro20  in  maintenance  treatment  of  children  with  CIDP. 
Nevertheless,  the  extrapolation  to  the  paediatric  population  was  accepted  by  the  CHMP  and  Hizentra  is 
indicated also in children and adolescents. 
The CIDP relapse rate (excluding withdrawal for any other reason) appears to be lower in subjects treated 
with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 vs. 0.2 g/kg IgPro20.  
Study  IgPro20_3003  did  not  include  enough  subjects  for  showing  beneficial  effects  in  the  elderly 
population (> 65 years), however, a comparable beneficial outcome as observed in the age group 18 – 65 
years might have become apparent if more subjects > 65 years had been included in the study. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of IgPro20 seen in the study mainly include local reactions (most frequent), 
fatigue and headache. The overall frequency of AEs was low (36.8% of placebo subjects, 57.9% of 
subjects on 0.2 g/kg, and 51.7% of subjects on 0.4 g/kg), with very few systemic AEs. Most AEs reported 
in the 3 treatment groups were mild or moderate. The only AESI reported during the SC treatment period 
was 1 event of allergic dermatitis. There were no proven cases of haemolysis, aseptic meningitis 
syndrome, or thrombotic events during the s.c. treatment period.

3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
During the s.c. treatment period with IgPro20, 4 subjects in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group and 2 subjects of 
the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group yielded insufficient data to evaluate haemolysis cases. In these subjects 
either baseline data for haemoglobin were missing + at least 1 post-baseline DAT was positive + at least 
1 of the criteria B was met or no post-baseline laboratory data were available. Thus, the occurrence of 
hemolysis cases due to IgPro20 treatment in these patients cannot be entirely ruled out. In addition, the 
MAH plans to increase the infusion volume and infusion rate of IgPro20. However, based on the sparse 
data obtained and provided, safety of the increased infusion volume and infusion rate is uncertain and 
cannot be adequately assessed for acceptability at the present time.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment of both low and high dose IgPro20 led to a significant reduction of CIDP relapse (or withdrawal 
for any other reason) compared to placebo. CIDP relapse was based on the adjusted INCAT score, which 
was the basis for calculation of CIDP response rates in various other studies on IVIGs in CIDP. The 10-
point INCAT score is a globally accepted, validated, and reliable scale of disability. A change of 1 INCAT 
score point is considered clinically meaningful, (excluding an increase in INCAT score of 1 point if this is 
only due to an increase of the arm score from 0 to 1 or an unchanged adjusted INCAT score compared 
with the Reference Visit (IgPro10 Restabilization Period) or to Baseline (SC Treatment Period), where the 
arm score decreased from 1 to 0 (not clinically meaningful improvement) and the leg score increased by 
1 point (clinically meaningful worsening)). Secondary efficacy endpoints analysed in this study also 
revealed positive differences between both IgPro20 treatment arms and placebo. Thus, s.c. treatment 
with IgPro20 was shown to be effective in CIDP maintenance treatment.  
Marginal uncertainty exists with respect to the overlapping effect of prior IVIG treatment and potential 
increase of CIDP relapse rates after complete washout of Privigen. With respect to long-term efficacy and 
safety, results from the extension study IgPro20_3004 which enrolled subjects who completed Study 
3003 or were successfully rescued from CIDP relapse in Study 3003 could provide further information. 
In general, IgPro20 revealed a reasonable safety profile in the maintenance treatment of CIDP. Except for 
1 acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction (allergic dermatitis), no other adverse events of special interest 
(hemolysis, aseptic meningitis, thrombotic events) occurred during the study. However, there is 
uncertainty with regard to haemolytic cases, since 6 subjects yielded insufficient data to evaluate 
hemolysis. The most frequent AEs were local reactions, causally related AEs included headache and 
fatigue. The majority of AEs was mild to moderate in severity and manageable. There was 1 case of non-
serious, causally related and / or temporally associated AE of fatigue that led to subject discontinuation 
from the study. Overall, the safety profile was rather similar as it is known from other indications and no 
new safety signals were identified.

3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
IgPro20_3003 analysed SCIG in the maintenance treatment of CIDP and showed a clinically and 
statistically relevant reduction in CIDP relapse rate based on the adjusted INCAT score. The safety profile 
of IgPro20 was consistent with that previously reported. The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
The  difference  in  CIDP  relapse  comparing  both  high  and  low  dose  IgPro20  with  placebo  is  statistically 
significant  and  clinically  relevant.  Since  only  IVIG-stabilized  subjects  were  included,  the  extension  of 
indication  solely  affects  maintenance  treatment  of  CIDP  after  prior  IVIG  treatment.  Results  from 
secondary  endpoints  are  generally  consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint.  The  acceptable  safety  profile 
also indicates a positive benefit-risk balance. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Hizentra is positive.

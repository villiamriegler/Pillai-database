Limited.

Benlysta is indicated as add-on therapy in adult  patients with  active, autoantibody-positive 
systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) with  a high  degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti 
dsDNA and low  complement) despite standard therapy (see section 5.1). 
Benlysta  is indicated in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies 
for the treatment  of adult patients  with active  lupus nephritis (see sections 4.2 and

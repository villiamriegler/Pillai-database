1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Enbrel contains etanercept, which is a tumour necrosis factor- (TNF) inhibitor. Etanercept is a 
recombinant protein consisting of human p75 tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) fused to the 
crystallisable fragment (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G1. Etanercept acts as a soluble receptor, which 
binds both TNF and TNFß (lymphotoxin), and prevents them from binding to their target receptors on 
the surfaces of cells thus preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses.  
TNF is a cytokine in the inflammatory process of various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in adults other diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). 
Etanercept is authorised for use in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 
children aged 4 to 17 years, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis in adults and 
paediatric plaque psoriasis. 
The MAH submitted this variation application to extend the lower age range for the approved 
therapeutic indication for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) “from the age of 4 years” to 
“from the age of 2 years” with consequential changes to section 4.1, 4.2 and to the package leaflets. 
Information relating to the supporting clinical trial (20021626) has been added to section 5.1. 
The initially applied wording for extension of indication reads as follows: 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents from the age 
of 4 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, 
methotrexate. Enbrel has not been studied in children aged less than 4 2 years. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended the application included an EMA 
decision (P/236/2010) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) with a deferral. 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred.  
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1 Introduction 
In support of this variation the MAH provided 
1.  The CSR 75813 for study 20021626 (assessed in FU2 096.3, AR adopted in March 2009 with 
conclusions that there was no change to the positive benefit/risk for Enbrel) 
2.  an Addendum to the final study report which analysed safety and efficacy data on the 2 to <4 
year old subjects with polyarticular JIA 
As the registry study 20021626 was assessed previously (FU2 096.3) only the summary of the main 
study will be presented and this assessment report will then focus on the Addendum examining safety 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126

and efficacy in the 2-4 year old age group under the Ancillary analysis section. Comparison with the 
safety and efficacy of the whole overall group (aged 1-18 years) will be made. 
3.2.2 GCP  
The Clinical trials submitted in support of this variation were performed in accordance with GCP as 
claimed by the applicant.  
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
3.2.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The approved dosage forms of etanercept include powder and solvent for solution for injection and 
solution for injection in a prefilled syringe. All etanercept dosage forms are intended for subcutaneous 
(SC) injection. For the treatment of JIA in children ≥4 years, the approved dosage of etanercept is 
0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) twice weekly (BIW; 72 to 96 hours apart). For the 
treatment of psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 8 years, the approved dosage of 
etanercept is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) QW.  
The formulation of etanercept used in registry 20021626 was identical to the 25 mg/ml powder and 
solvent for solution for injection for paediatric use that is currently approved in the EU for JIA. The 
dosage regimen used in registry 20021626 was 0.8 mg/kg QW, up to a maximum dose of 50 mg. This 
varies from the 0.4 mg/kg BIW regimen, up to a maximum dose of 25 mg per dose approved in the EU 
for the treatment of JIA in children ≥4 years. 
There was no pharmacokinetic investigation in registry 20021626 and there are no etanercept PK data 
available in JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years. However, based on existing knowledge of etanercept 
pharmacokinetics, the serum etanercept exposure in JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years receiving 
0.4 mg/kg BIW is expected to be in the same range as JIA subjects aged 4 to 17 years receiving 
0.4 mg/kg BIW or adult RA subjects receiving 25 mg BIW. Etanercept pharmacokinetics have been well 
characterized in adult subjects with RA, AS and psoriasis, and data is available in juvenile subjects 
aged 4 to 17 years with JIA and in juvenile subjects aged 4 to 17 years with psoriasis in population PK 
analyses, and etanercept pharmacokinetics were similar among all patient populations. Adult (age >17 
years) healthy subjects and adult subjects with RA have consistent PK exposure with no significant 
effect of age and body weight (Figure 1).

Figure 1:   The Relationship of Etanercept apparent clearance with Age and Body Weight 
The 0.4 mg/kg BIW dose has been studied in JIA subjects (study 16.0016, the CSR of which was 
submitted during the original Marketing Authorisation Application [MAA; EMA/H/C/262], approved in 
February 2000). As shown in Figure 2, trough etanercept concentrations in JIA subjects following 
0.4 mg/kg BIW doses were comparable to those of adult subjects receiving a fixed dose of 25 mg BIW. 
Body weight-adjusted apparent clearance is comparable between paediatric JIA subjects and adult 
subjects; thus, adjusting the dose in JIA subjects for body weight (0.4 mg/kg BIW) achieved blood 
concentrations similar to that observed in adult subjects who received 25 mg BIW in study 088A3-314-
EU (CSR was submitted in support of procedure EMA/H/C/262/II/66, approved in April 2006 (Figure 
2)).

Figure  2:      Sparse  and  Trough  Etanercept  Concentrations  in  JIA  Subjects  Following  0.4-
mg/kg Twice Weekly Dose and in Adult subjects Following 25-mg Twice Weekly Dose 
Body weight is expected to increase with age in male and female paediatric patients under the age of 
18 years, with an average 2- to 4-year-old normally weighing between 10 to ~15 kg. Assuming that 
etanercept clearance would decrease with body weight in 2- to 4-year-olds in a manner similar to that 
for 4- to 17-year-olds, the expected drop in clearance in a 2- to 4-year-old would require the same 
dose adjustment based on a smaller body weight as applied to patients 4 to 17 years old. The lower 
etanercept dose in JIA patients aged 2 to 4 years together with a slower etanercept clearance is 
expected to produce etanercept exposure comparable to JIA patients aged 4 to 17 years. 
In addition, the 0.8 mg/kg QW regimen used in registry 20021626 is expected to produce exposure 
similar to the 0.4 mg/kg BIW dose regimen. The etanercept pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects 
was initially assessed in JIA subjects in study 16.0016. After repeated BIW doses of 0.4 mg/kg, the 
children had a mean serum etanercept concentration of 2100 ng/mL. In the paediatric psoriasis study 
20030211 (the CSR of which was presented in variation EMA/H/C/262/II/94, approved in December 
2008), etanercept pharmacokinetics were assessed in paediatric subjects with psoriasis who received 
0.8 mg/kg QW. Mean and median steady-state trough concentrations were similar across visits (range 
from 1600 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL). For subjects who received etanercept during the entire 48-week 
study, the mean trough etanercept concentration was 1829 ng/mL, which was 10% to 20% lower than 
the mean trough steady-state etanercept concentration of 2100 ng/mL observed in subjects with JIA 
after receiving 0.4 mg/kg etanercept BIW. This is consistent with the expected approximately 20% 
lower trough concentrations of the QW regimen as compared to the BIW regimen. Given the inter-
subject variability observed, the mean trough etanercept serum concentrations following 0.8 mg/kg 
etanercept QW in paediatric psoriasis subjects are generally comparable to those observed following 
0.4 mg/kg etanercept BIW in JIA subjects. Similar results were seen when comparing 25 mg BIW and 
50 mg QW in adult RA subjects. Based on these results, it is expected that the safety and efficacy 
profiles of 0.4 mg/kg BIW and 0.8 mg/kg QW will be similar.

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has presented a clinical registry study in children with JIA between 2 and 17 years old. In this 
study the dose used was 0.8 mg/kg QW up to a maximum dose of 50 mg peer week, whereas the dose 
approved in children with JIA between 4 and 17 is 0.4 mg/kg BIW.  
The MAH was not in a position to provide the additional PK data for children based on serum samples 
collected in study 20021626 as requested by CHMP. The CHMP also noted the recruitment challenges 
for some studies where additional PK data could have been generated. Therefore, despite the lack of 
this additional information the CHMP considered that the available data and the PK modelling are 
supportive of a weight based dosing in children aged 2-3 years. 
Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that:  
 
The  mechanism  of  disease  is  considered  to  be  the  same  for  2-  <4  yr  olds  compared  with 
children above the age of 4 years. 
PK data is available in children from the age of 4 yrs 
 
  No difference would be expected in the 2-< 4 yr old group compared with older children.  
Therefore, the absence of more detailed PK in children aged 2-<4 years was deemed acceptable.  
The similar exposure from 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly and 0.8 mg/kg weekly is accepted and has been 
demonstrated for adults with RA and children above the age of 8 years with paediatric psoriasis.  
Therefore the posology of 0.8 mg/kg once weekly for JIA in study 20021626 can be accepted as 
providing similar levels as the EU approved posology of 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly. 
3.2.4 Clinical efficacy 
Study 20021626 was an open-label, multicenter registry for children aged 2 to 18 years with a 
diagnosis of polyarticular-course or systemic JIA. The objective of the registry was to determine the 
long-term safety of etanercept administered with or without MTX compared to MTX alone in paediatric 
subjects with polyarticular-course or systemic JIA. Eligible subjects received etanercept alone, 
etanercept plus MTX, or MTX alone. Subjects were also allowed to be on other concomitant DMARDs. 
Etanercept was administered SC at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg per week (up to maximum dose of 50 mg per 
week) for up to 36 months. In the comparator group, MTX was dosed at the investigator’s discretion at 
a dose of at least 10 mg/m2/week but not to exceed 1 mg/kg/week. Safety data, including adverse 
events and medically important infections, were collected on all subjects. A limited set of effectiveness 
and health outcomes data were also collected. All subjects were followed in this registry for up to 36 
months. 
It is of note that both polyarticular and systemic JIA cases were included in the trial. As the current 
approved indication in JIA is restricted to the polyarticular subtype, the Addendum provided by the 
MAH (see under Ancillary analysis) focuses on polyarticular JIA in those aged 2 to <4 years. 
Main studies 
Study 20021626: a Phase IV registry of etanercept in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 6/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods 
This was an open-label, multicenter, registry study to assess the long-term safety of etanercept in 
children with polyarticular course or systemic JRA. Approximately 400 subjects received etanercept 
alone or etanercept plus methotrexate or other DMARDs, and approximately 200 subjects received 
methotrexate alone or methotrexate with other DMARDs for 36 months. 
Subjects who enrolled into the study on methotrexate but who subsequently switched to etanercept 
(alone or in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs) were eligible to be re-enrolled into the 
etanercept arm of the study if they had not been in the study for more than 30 months. Subjects who 
enrolled into the study on the etanercept arm were not re-enrolled into the methotrexate arm if they 
discontinued etanercept and continued or started methotrexate. 
Safety data, including significant adverse events and infections, was collected on all subjects.

Treatments 
This was a non-randomized study. Subjects who satisfied all eligibility criteria were enrolled into 1 of 3 
cohorts in the study based on their baseline treatment (Figure 3).  
Figure 3:   Study Design and Treatment Schema 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the long-term safety of etanercept administered with or 
without other DMARDs in paediatric subjects with polyarticular course or systemic juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis (JRA) compared to a control cohort of subjects with polyarticular course or systemic JRA 
receiving methotrexate (with or without other DMARDs).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Assessments included adverse event assessments, Tanner scores (by physical examination), 
behavioral assessment (Achenbach CBCL appropriate by age group), paediatric quality of life, 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 8/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
physician’s global assessment of overall disease activity (scale 0 to 10), and paediatric joint 
assessment.  
Sample size 
Sample Size Considerations 
Table 1 provides event rates for etanercept and methotrexate with approximately 80% power to detect 
a treatment difference (using a 2-sided, 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions). 
Table 1 Event Rates Whose Difference is Detectable with 80% Power 
At full enrollment (400 subjects in the etanercept arm and 200 subjects in the methotrexate arm) the 
trial has 80% power to detect an increase from 0.10 to 0.19 in the proportion of subjects with an event 
(relative risk = 1.9). 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive summary statistics for observed data are provided for each study endpoint. For categorical 
endpoints, the summary statistics contain the frequency and percentage. For continuous endpoints, the 
summary statistics contain the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and 95% confidence interval for mean (except for the safety laboratory assessment). The 
interested comparison for any study endpoint was between methotrexate and etanercept, with 
significance level of 0.05. Possible confounding factors were examined to adjust for the potential 
difference between cohorts and adjust for subjects who switched from methotrexate to etanercept or 
etanercept plus methotrexate. Study centers were pooled for all analyses and summaries. Missing 
values were not imputed for the primary and secondary endpoints in this study. 
Efficacy analyses 
Paediatric joint assessments and the physician’s global assessment were summarized with descriptive 
statistics at each visit, by treatment group. Due to the non-randomized nature of this study and the 
possibility that some subjects could have changed treatment arms mid-study, there may be some 
selection bias in treatment group assignment with regards to disease severity, type, or duration. For 
this reason, no inferential statistics were performed on the efficacy endpoints. 
Growth Data 
Growth data (height, age, and weight) and Tanner scores (approximately 30% of subjects) were 
compared between treatment cohorts. Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were also compared 
using percentiles from standardized growth charts. Each subject’s baseline and last on-study height, 
weight, and BMI were compared to the charts for their age and sex, and the percentile for each height, 
weight, and BMI was recorded. The change in percentile from baseline to end of study was compared 
between the treatment arms, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusted for possible 
confounders. 
Quality-of-Life Analyses 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 9/55
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL™) Inventory Module and PedsQL Arthritis Module scores, child 
behavior checklist sub-scales and total scores were summarized with descriptive statistics at each visit, 
by treatment arm. 
Safety Analyses 
Adverse event rates, serious adverse event rates, infection rates, and medically important infection 
rates were compared between treatment arms. Poisson regressions adjusted for age, sex, baseline 
disease characteristics, and treatment crossover were used to compare etanercept with methotrexate 
for cancer, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, autoimmune events, medically important infections, or 
psychiatric and behavioural problems. Treatment arms were compared with respect to the occurrence 
of any new autoimmune disease. Cancer rates for each treatment arm were to be compared between 
arms. Infection was summarized as reported by the treating physician. 
Results  
Participant flow  
a. Eight (8) out of 16 subjects who discontinued from the methotrexate arm re-enrolled in the etanercept only arm or etanercept + 
methotrexate arm. The remaining 8 subjects permanently discontinued from the registry. 
b. Following discontinuation from the methotrexate only arm, none of the patients who re-enrolled in the etanercept only arm 
discontinued from the registry. 
c. Following discontinuation from the methotrexate only arm, 2 of the patients who re-enrolled in the etanercept + methotrexate 
arm discontinued from the registry. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 32 study centers (28 in the United States and 4 in Canada). 
Subjects who satisfied all eligibility criteria were enrolled into 1 of 3 cohorts in the study based on their 
baseline treatment. Subjects were registered by contacting the Paediatric Rheumatology Collaborative 
Study Group and assigned a study number. The final subject’s last visit occurred in January 2008, and 
the final clinical study report (CSR) was prepared in November 2008. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 5 amendments to this study at the time this report was completed. These amendments are 
considered as acceptable by the CHMP.

Gender and race were consistent across the 3 treatment groups, with a higher percentage of females 
and Caucasians observed in both the overall population (Table 2).  
Table 2. Demographic Characteristics

The mean duration of JIA was approximately 2 times longer for subjects receiving etanercept only and 
etanercept + MTX compared with those receiving MTX only.  
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Subjects in the etanercept only arm had the longest mean (SD) duration of JRA with 58 months (44.5) 
while the subjects in the methotrexate only arm had the shortest mean (SD) duration of JRA (20 
months [30.7]); the etanercept + methotrexate arm had a mean (SD) duration of JRA of 41 months 
(41.7). The range for the etanercept only arm was 1.9 to 179.0 months; the overall range was 0.2 to 
199.5 months. The majority of subjects in each arm had polyarticular JRA with a polyarticular onset. 
Most subjects were negative for rheumatoid factor. Although 1 subject (etanercept only arm) was 
reported to have had a history of cancer, this was later determined to be incorrect and therefore a 
database errata was created. 
The median (range) number of active arthritic joints was 6 (0 to 47) for the methotrexate only arm, 4 
(0 to 46) for the etanercept only arm, and 6 (0 to 59) for the etanercept + methotrexate arm. 
At enrollment, subjects were to provide a list of all anti-rheumatic medications taken since their 
diagnosis with JRA. 86% in the etanercept only arm had a history of MTX use. In the overall population 
86-100% had a history of MTX use and >98% in the etanercept only and etanercept plus MTX groups 
had a history of etanercept use. In the MTX arm only 0.5% had prior history of etanercept use.  
Subjects were also asked to specify which medications they were currently taking for the treatment of 
their JRA. Based on the categories for medications used, a large percentage of subjects were taking 
NSAIDs at baseline; 91% of subjects in the methotrexate only arm, 73% in the etanercept only arm; 
and 85% in the etanercept + methotrexate arm. The dose of MTX in the study ranged from a dose of 
at least 10 mg/m2/week but not to exceed 1 mg/kg/week. Over half of the subjects in the 
methotrexate only and etanercept + methotrexate arm were also on folinic or folic acid at baseline, 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 12/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
61% and 68%, respectively. Only 9% of the subjects in the etanercept only arm were taking folinic or 
folic acid at baseline. 
Numbers analysed 
Enrollment and Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 594 subjects were enrolled; 197 subjects were receiving methotrexate only, 103 subjects 
were receiving etanercept only, and 294 subjects were receiving etanercept + methotrexate. Per the 
protocol, subjects in the methotrexate only arm who discontinued from methotrexate and switched to 
etanercept treatment or added etanercept to existing methotrexate within 30 months of enrollment 
were allowed to re-enroll in the etanercept only or etanercept + methotrexate arms of the study. 
However, subjects who discontinued etanercept were not eligible to re-enroll in the methotrexate only 
arm. In this study, 32 subjects were allowed to re-enroll; 8 subjects re-enrolled into the etanercept 
only arm and 24 subjects re-enrolled into the etanercept + methotrexate arm.   
Thirty-one (31) patients have switched from MTX only arm. Eight (8) switched to the etanercept only 
arm and 23 to the etanercept + MTX arm. Of the 31 cases that were re-enrolled, 7 were re-enrolled 
after 1 year and so the follow-up for these cases is short.  
The most frequently cited reasons for study discontinuation in the methotrexate only arm was 
insufficient therapeutic effect (18.3%), other (15.2%), and remission (12.2%); in the etanercept only 
arm was other (15.5%); and in the etanercept + methotrexate arm was insufficient therapeutic effect 
(20.1%) and other (16.3%). 
Protocol Deviations and Treatment Compliance 
The protocol deviations were predominantly missed visits. 
Treatment compliance was not monitored as part of this registry study because investigational product 
was supplied via prescription by the treating physician. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy Results: 
At year 3, the mean (SD) percentage improvement in the number of active arthritic joints was 57% 
(93.6) for the methotrexate only arm, 63% (56.2) for the etanercept only arm, and 59% (75.8) for the 
etanercept + methotrexate arm (Table 3).

At year 3, the mean (SD) percentage improvement in the Physician Global Assessment of Disease 
Activity was 61% (45.0) for the methotrexate only arm, 61% (44.1) for the etanercept only arm, and 
55% (53.3) for the etanercept + methotrexate arm (Table 4).

Patient-reported Outcomes:  
Following treatment, subjects in all 3 treatment arms had improvement on all domains including 
physical, psychosocial, emotional, social and school as well as pain and hurt, daily activities, 
treatment, worry, and communication at each visit.  
Ancillary analyses 
In support of the current variation, the MAH analysed the data in the subjects who were 2 to <4 years 
old with polyarticular JIA. The restriction to polyarticular JIA is in line with the currently approved 
indication in JIA which is restricted to the polyarticular subtype. 
The subgroup analysis included subjects with polyarticular JIA who were between the ages of 2 and <4 
years at the time of enrolment in registry 20021626 and who were included in the final safety analysis 
in CSR-75813. Subjects with either systemic-onset or systemic-course JIA were not included in the 
subgroup analysis. Forty-seven (47) subjects were included in the subgroup analysis: 22 subjects 
received MTX only, 6 subjects received etanercept only, and 19 subjects received etanercept + MTX. 
Although data were collected on 47 subjects across the 3 treatment groups, there were 39 unique 
subjects included in this subgroup analysis because there were 8 subjects in the MTX only arm who re-
enrolled in the etanercept only or etanercept + MTX arm (figure 4).

Gender and race were consistent across the 3 treatment groups, with a higher percentage of females 
and Caucasians observed in the subpopulation aged 2 to <4 years (table 5).

Table 5: Demographic Characteristics for Polyarticular JIA Subjects Aged 2 to <4 Years in 
Registry 20021626 
The mean duration of JIA was approximately 2 times longer for subjects receiving etanercept only and 
etanercept + MTX compared with those receiving MTX only. The mean number of active joints at 
baseline for subjects aged 2 to <4 years was consistent with that of the overall population (Table 6).

Table 6: Baseline Paediatric Total Joint Assessment (All Sites) for Polyarticular JIA Subjects 
Aged 2 to <4 Years in Registry 20021626 
Gender and race across the 3 treatment groups were consistent with a higher percentage of females 
(83% and 74% of the subpopulation and overall population, respectively) and Caucasians (85% and 
75% of the subpopulation and overall population, respectively) observed in both populations.  
Duration of disease activity for the subpopulation was considerably less than that for the overall 
population because of the young age of this group. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of 
JIA for subjects aged 2 to <4 years was 7.51 ± 6.60 months, 13.94 ± 6.83 months, and 13.32 ± 9.05 
months for the MTX only, etanercept only, and etanercept + MTX treatment arms, respectively.  
This is consistent with the overall population for whom the disease duration was approximately 2 times 
longer for subjects receiving etanercept only and etanercept + MTX compared with those receiving 
MTX only.  
Shorter disease duration in the MTX arm is seen and this is consistent with the data from the overall 
population. Of note, the age group in the MTX only arm is younger than the other treatment arms with 
a median age of 2 years (range 2-3 years ) compared with a median age of 3 years (range 2-4 yrs) in 
the etanercept containing  treatment arms. The MAH has provided a breakdown of the ages in months 
for all subjects in each of the three treatment arms as well as the age in months of the 8 subjects who 
switched treatment arms at the time of the switch. Among the etanercept-treated subjects, 10 were 
below 3 years of age and 13 were aged 3 to <4 years (Table 7)

Table 7. Summary of Age at Time of Enrollment for Polyarticular JIA Subjects Aged 2 to <4 
Years (Registry 20021626): Number (%) of Subjects 
Most subjects in both the overall population and the subpopulation were already on treatment at 
baseline of the registry. Of the subjects aged 2 to <4 years, 100% in the MTX only arm were on MTX; 
100% in the etanercept only arm were on etanercept; and 100% in the etanercept + MTX arm were on 
etanercept or MTX, respectively. In addition, 83.3% of subjects in the etanercept only arm had 
received MTX prior to baseline. 
A very high percentage of this subgroup was on treatment prior baseline in this study, as was the case 
for the overall population and so the interpretation of efficacy is limited. All patients in the etanercept 
containing arms were on treatment prior to entry into the study for an average time of between 
approximately 1 to 3 months; the longest duration in one subject was 192 days.    
Subjects in the etanercept only and etanercept + MTX arms received MTX for a longer period of time 
before entering the registry as compared to the MTX only arm (158.80, 273.53, and 63.73 days, 
respectively). Subjects in the etanercept + MTX arm had the greatest prior MTX exposure. The 
duration of prior MTX use is consistent with the longer disease duration in the etanercept only and 
etanercept + MTX arms as compared to the MTX only arm. The mean ± SD number of active joints at 
baseline for subjects aged 2 to <4 years was 13.7 ± 9.7, 5.3 ± 6.7, and 10.4 ± 9.5 for the MTX only, 
etanercept only and etanercept + MTX treatment arms, respectively. 
This is consistent with the overall population in whom the mean ± SD number of active joints at 
baseline was 9.1 ± 9.2, 8.4 ± 9.8, and 9.5 ± 9.8 active joint for the MTX only, etanercept only and 
etanercept + MTX treatment arms, respectively. 
Discontinuations 
The most common reasons for discontinuation among polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years 
were “insufficient therapeutic effect” and “other”. 
Overall, a higher percentage of subjects discontinued from the MTX only arm than from either of the 
etanercept arms. In addition, according to Kaplan-Meier plots, subjects in the MTX arm withdrew 
earlier than those in either of the etanercept arms.  
A higher percentage of subjects completed the study in the etanercept-containing arms (63.2 – 
66.7%) than the MTX only arm (27.3%). Insufficient therapeutic response was commonest single 
reason for discontinuation in the MTX only group. Although the numbers are small particularly in the 
etanercept only group (n=4), similar to the overall population there is evidence of “remission” in 9-
10.5%.   
A Kaplan-Meier plot of study discontinuation for subjects aged 2 to <4 years shows that the rate of 
discontinuation was greatest for the MTX only arm, and that subjects in the MTX only arm withdrew 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 19/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
earlier in the registry (Figure 5). After 1 year, approximately 35% of the MTX subjects had withdrawn. 
However, only approximately 15% and 5% of subjects had withdrawn from the etanercept only and 
etanercept + MTX arms, respectively. At year 3 of the registry, approximately 80% of the MTX 
subjects, 30% of the etanercept only subjects and 65% of the etanercept + MTX subjects had 
withdrawn. The Kaplan-Meier plot of study discontinuation for the overall population demonstrates 
similar results (Figure 6).

A similar Kaplan-Meier profile was seen when those subjects who re-enrolled in the etanercept only or 
etanercept + MTX arm were excluded (Figures 7 and 8).

EFFICACY RESULTS IN THE 2 TO <4 YEAR SUBGROUP 
A limited set of efficacy parameters, including Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) 
and joint assessment, and health outcomes assessments including Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL), 
were collected and are summarized below for both the subgroup of polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to 
<4 years as well as for the overall population.  
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
PGA was collected from all subjects receiving treatment at the time of the evaluation. Because there 
were a large number of discontinuations by year 3, especially in the MTX group for the reason of 
insufficient therapeutic response, the number of subjects with available PGA data at year 3 is small. At 
year 1, when there were more subjects with available PGA data, the mean (SD) percentage 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 21/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement in the PGA was 62.5% (28.5) for the etanercept only arm and 68.5% (34.8) for the 
etanercept + MTX arm versus 26.0% (85.1) for the MTX only arm. At year 3, the mean (SD) 
percentage improvement in the PGA for polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years was greater for 
both etanercept treatment arms compared with the MTX only arm: 91.7% (16.7) for the etanercept 
only arm and 89.6% (23.4) for the etanercept + MTX arm versus 66.7% (42.5) for the MTX only arm.  
The numbers remaining are smaller at 36 months, but the efficacy is consistent with results from the 
overall population (Table 8).

A comparable result was observed at year 3 for the overall population: 61% for the MTX only arm, 
61% for the etanercept only arm and 55% for the etanercept + MTX arm (Table 9).

Paediatric Quality of Life 
The PedsQL Arthritis Module scores were summarized by subdomain (daily activities, pain and hurt, 
and treatment) for the toddler age group of 2 to <4 years old. Following 3 years of treatment, 
polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years in all treatment arms had similar improvements in the 3 
subdomains (Tables 10, 11 and 12).

similar improvements in these 3 subdomains at year 3. 
Patient Quality of Life Assessments 
The PedsQL Core Module and PedsQL Arthritis Module scores were summarized for the following age 
groups: toddler (≤4 years old), young children (5 to 7 years old), children (8 to 12 years old), and 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 27/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
teens (13 to 18 years old). An overall summary of these 2 quality of life assessments was also 
performed. 
At baseline for the PedsQL Core Module, subjects in the 3 treatment arms had comparable scores. 
Following treatment, subjects in all treatment arms had improvement on all domains including 
physical, psychosocial, emotional, social and school at each visit. Results of additional analysis by age 
and treatment arm were consistent with the overall findings. 
At baseline for the PedsQL Arthritis Module, subjects in 3 treatment arms had comparable scores on all 
domains (pain and hurt, daily activities, treatment, worry, and communication). Following treatment, 
subjects in all treatment arms had improvement on all domains at each visit. Results of additional 
analysis by age and treatment arm were consistent with the overall findings. 
Efficacy Analysis of 8 subjects who switched treatment and re-enrolled 
Eight of the 22 polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years who were receiving MTX at baseline were 
allowed to discontinue from the MTX only arm and to re-enroll into the etanercept only or etanercept + 
MTX arm.  
The results show that at year 3, the mean percentage improvement in the PGA for the subjects who 
re-enrolled in the etanercept only or etanercept + MTX arm (100% and 97.5%, respectively) was 
similar to that for the subjects who were originally assigned to the etanercept only or etanercept + 
MTX arm (83.3% and 85.6%, respectively) (Table13).

As was done with percentage improvement in mean PGA, an analysis was done in which the 8 
polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years who discontinued from the MTX only arm and re-enrolled 
into the etanercept only or etanercept + MTX arm were summarized as separate treatment arms 
according to whether they had a PGA of zero over time. The results showed that subjects who switched 
from MTX to etanercept or etanercept + MTX had a similar treatment response as those who received 
etanercept or etanercept + MTX throughout the entire registry. Overall, between 50% and 100% of 
the subjects aged 2 to <4 years in each treatment arm had a PGA score of zero by year 3 (Table 14).  
Table 14. Subjects With Total Physician Global Assessment = 0 Over Time for Polyarticular 
JIA Subjects Aged 2 to <4 Years in Registry 20021626, With Re-enrolled Subjects Presented 
Separately 
Similarly, in the overall population, between 30% and 80% of subjects in each treatment arm had a 
PGA score of zero at year 3 (Table 15).

Table 15. Subjects with Physician Global Assessment = 0, Over Time Overall population. 
Total Joint Assessments 
Per the protocol for registry 20021626, joint assessments were collected at baseline and at month 36 
from all subjects receiving treatment at the time of the assessment; however, joint assessments were 
collected more frequently (i.e., at months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30) from subjects who had previously 
participated in study 16.0028 (a JIA study that was terminated early because of slow enrollment). 
Based on the number of subjects who participated in study 16.0028 as well as those remaining on 
treatment at month 36, the data available for these analyses are extremely limited. 
Number of Active Joints 
The mean (SD) percentage improvement in the number of active joints at year 1 for polyarticular JIA 
subjects aged 2 to <4 was 69.86% (36.78) for the MTX only arm, 75% (0.00) for the etanercept only 
arm, and 87.04% (23.24) for the etanercept + MTX arm. At year 3, the mean (SD) percentage 
improvement in the number of active joints was 81.11% (31.10) for the MTX only arm, 100% (0.00) 
for the etanercept only arm, and 90.40% (28.62) for the etanercept + MTX arm (Table 16).

As was done with PGA, an analysis was done in which the 8 polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 
years who discontinued from the MTX only arm and re-enrolled into the etanercept only or etanercept 
+ MTX arm were summarized as separate treatment arms according to whether they had zero active 
joints over time. The results showed that subjects who switched from MTX to etanercept or etanercept 
+ MTX had a similar treatment response as those who had received etanercept or etanercept + MTX 
throughout the entire registry. Overall, 50% to 100% of the polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 
years in each treatment arm had zero active joints by year 3 (Table 18).

joints at year 3 (Table 19).

Limitation of Motion 
The mean (SD) percentage improvement in joints with limitation of motion at year 1 for polyarticular 
JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years was 80.00% (33.32) for the MTX only arm, 100% (0.00) for the 
etanercept only arm, and 58.04% (43.28) for the etanercept + MTX arm. At year 3, the mean (SD) 
percentage improvement in joints with limitation of motion was 91.11% (14.40) for the MTX only arm, 
87.50% (25.00) for the etanercept only arm, and 79.96% (38.55) for the etanercept + MTX arm. 
A comparable result was observed at year 3 for the overall population: 57%, 23%, and 43% for the 
MTX only, etanercept only, and etanercept + MTX arms, respectively (Table 20).

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The registry baseline is not the true baseline for these patients as the majority were on treatment with 
either methotrexate or etanercept prior to entry into this open label trial. The indication for JIA is for 
those who have an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of methotrexate. The fact 
that the majority of subjects who were in the etanercept-containing arm have received prior 
methotrexate does support the assumption that these cases responded inadequately to or were 
intolerant to MTX. Therefore while this trial provides limited evidence of efficacy the included group can 
be considered to reflect those who in clinical practice will be eligible for etanercept treatment. 
Regarding the sample size, the numbers are considered sufficient to pick up a 1.9 increased event rate 
in the etanercept containing arms. No sample size calculation was done considering efficacy objectives 
due to the study design. 
Less than half of the patients completed the study, the smallest proportion in the MTX arm. 
Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events and refusals were similar in all three treatment 
arms. Discontinuation as a result of insufficient therapeutic response was commonest in the combined 
etanercept + MTX group. The breakdown of JIA subtypes in those who discontinued in each of the 
treatment arms as a result of insufficient response demonstrated that those with systemic onset and 
those with systemic course JIA had the highest rate of discontinuation due to insufficient therapeutic 
response in each of the three treatment arms. 
In the whole population there are around 15% of patients in each group of treatment who discontinued 
the study due to “other reasons” and the majority of these cases were due to loss of follow-up. 
The MAH was asked to discuss the issue on how long treatment should be continued once remission is 
achieved. The MAH has provided a comprehensive literature review and a post-hoc analysis of data 
from Study 16.0016 in response to the question. Although the literature does report cases where 
treatment can be discontinued, there are a high percentage of patients who do relapse. More formal 
study of this phenomenon should be conducted as this is an important point to address, but it is 
acknowledged that due to the rarity and heterogeneity of polyarticular JIA that this will be challenging 
data to collect. The post-hoc review of data from study 16.0016 shows that for those who have a 
substantial response to treatment (ACR 70), 21% maintain this ACR70 at day 180 following treatment 
withdrawal. The results are in keeping with the high rate of relapse from the literature. Further 
information on whether there are particular features in either the disease itself or the response to 
therapy (including length of and extent of response) that may be of use for further guidance as to 
when and how to withdraw therapy will be difficult to collect formally in polyarticular JIA in view of the 
rarity of the condition. However the MAH will contact the JIA registries to examine whether collection 
of additional efficacy (effectiveness) information to address these questions could be possible as 
described in the RMP. 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 34/55
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The CHMP acknowledges that further guidance from the MAH on discontinuation of etanercept in the 
event of “remission” in JIA is not possible at this time. To reflect this lack of information the MAH has 
added the following sentence to section 5.1 of the SmPC: 
“Additionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the 
recommended dose of Enbrel following its long-term use in patients with JIA”.  
The MAH was also requested to discuss the length of time a patient with JIA should be treated before 
concluding that the patient is a non-responder. Bases on a literature review the MAH proposed to 
consider the discontinuation of the treatment in patients who show no response after 6 months. 
However the CHMP considered that advising ongoing treatment in non-responders for 6 months is 
difficult to justify, as etanercept is known to have a rapid onset of action with most cases showing 
benefit at 12 weeks and has a well described adverse safety profile. Alternative therapy is available for 
JIA cases that are considered to have failed anti-TNFs and so in line with ACR 2011 guidelines, a trial 
of etanercept for 4 months should be acceptable in accordance with the ACR guidance. This ensures 
that ineffective therapy is not continued long-term in children while also increasing slightly the 
numbers of patients who have a successful response. To reflect this information the MAH has added 
the following sentence to section 4.2 of the SmPC: “Discontinuation of treatment should be considered 
in patients who show no response after 4 months”. 
The changes in the paediatric life quality scores over time were minimal and no significant difference 
between the three treatment arms was evident. As the baseline data was not true baseline as all 
patients were already on treatment prior to entry, these results show no significant difference between 
the MTX group and the etanercept containing treatment arms. 
Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
In view of the open label nature of this trial and the fact that the majority of cases were on treatment 
prior to the registry study baseline, proof of efficacy cannot be formally demonstrated, as was 
performed in study 16.0016 and the main objective in the open label study 20021626 is safety. 
However the efficacy of the 2 to <4 year age group was consistent with the overall population, in 
whom efficacy has been demonstrated (in those aged 4 years and above with polyarticular JIA). 
Notably the overall population also included JIA subtype known not to be responsive to etanercept 
treatment namely systemic JIA and this subgroup accounted for between 6.6 and 11.2%. 
The difficulty to carry out an adequate clinical trial in the target population is acknowledged and this is 
a limitation of the registry. However, considering the possible differences between children below  
4 years and those above this age, it is unlikely that etanercept could modify its mechanism of action 
and consequently its pharmacodynamic effect, on the basis of physiological characteristics of the 
patients (2-4 years vs. older children). In addition, in the pathology of the disease there does not seem 
to be big differences with regard to age (at least in this case). Importantly, the efficacy data from the 
registry appear to confirm these statements.  
In summary, despite the study’s limitation, it is scientifically justified to conclude that the pathology of 
the disease, the physiological characteristics and the pharmacodynamics of the drug, should not be 
significantly different between children aged 2-3 years and those aged 4 years and above. The 
registry, which has shown efficacy and safety data of Enbrel in the target population, provides an 
acceptable level of support for this conclusion. 
3.2.5 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 35/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because drug administration information was not collected in this study, the exposure of etanercept or 
methotrexate are estimated from the reported drug start date and end date under an assumption that 
the subject received the drug as prescribed. The exposure to investigational product was calculated as 
(the investigational product stop date - the investigational product start date + 1) / 365.25. 
Using this formula, the mean (SD) years of exposure for each arm was as follows: 
1.97 years (1.09) for the methotrexate only arm, 2.17 years (1.04) for the etanercept only arm, and 
2.16 years (1.02) for the etanercept + methotrexate arm. The median (range) number of years 
exposed was 2.18 years (0.1 to 3.7) for the methotrexate only arm, 2.84 years (0.2 to 3.8 years) for 
the etanercept only arm, and 2.79 years (0.1 to 3.5) for the etanercept + methotrexate arm. 
Adverse events 
OVERALL POPULATION 
Overall, the safety profiles of the subjects from the methotrexate, etanercept and etanercept plus 
methotrexate arm were similar, with no significant difference in exposure-adjusted rates of adverse 
events between the arms. No cases of lymphoma, tuberculosis, malignancy, or death were reported 
during the study. There were no cases of demyelinating disorders in the etanercept only arm or 
etanercept with methotrexate arm, but there was 1 case of optic neuritis in the methotrexate only 
arm. 
All Adverse Events (Non-infectious) 
The exposure-adjusted adverse event rate, excluding infectious adverse events, was similar between 
the methotrexate only arm and the etanercept only arm. The body system with the highest exposure-
adjusted adverse event rates was nervous system. The preferred terms of abnormal liver function and 
increased SGPT (laboratory abnormalities ≥grade 2 were reported as adverse events) had the highest 
exposure-adjusted adverse event rates (2.06/100 subject-years). 
In the whole population, the exposure-adjusted rate of non-infectious AEs was similar among groups, 
with a higher rate in the combination arm. Some AEs are increased in the etanercept group (nervous 
system and haemic and lymphatic system). The number of subjects reporting an adverse event was 43 
(21.8%) for the methotrexate only arm, 26 (25.2%) for the etanercept only arm, and 78 (26.5%) for 
the etanercept + methotrexate arm.

The exposure-adjusted rate of AEs, excluding infections, for polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 
years was 22.02 per 100 subject-years for the MTX only arm, 0.0 per 100 subject-years for the 
etanercept only arm, and 4.22 per 100 subject-years for the etanercept + MTX arm (Table 22).

Table 22. Exposure-adjusted Rates of Adverse Events excluding infection for Polyarticular 
JIA Subjects Aged 2 to <4 Years in Registry 20021626 
The majority of the AEs occurred in the MTX only arm and most were liver- or gastrointestinal-related, 
as would be expected with MTX treatment.  
The number of polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years who experienced an AE was 6 (27.3%) in 
the MTX only arm, zero in the etanercept only arm, and 2 (10.5%) in the etanercept + MTX arm. 
Table 23. Subject Incidence of Adverse Events excluding infection for Polyarticular JIA 
Subjects Aged 2 to <4 Years in Registry 20021626 
The number of subjects in the overall population who experienced an AE was 43 (21.8%) in the MTX 
only arm, 26 (25.2%) in the etanercept only arm, and 78 (26.5%) in the etanercept + MTX arm (Table 
23). 
Infections 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 38/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Per the protocol, only medically important infections were collected. Nonserious infections were not 
collected. No medically important infections were reported in polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 
years. 
By comparison in the overall population, the exposure-adjusted rate of medically important infections 
was 1.29 per 100 subject-years in the MTX only arm, 1.78 per 100 subject-years in the etanercept 
only arm and 2.05 per 100 subject-years in the etanercept + MTX arm. One subject (etanercept + 
methotrexate arm) had an infectious adverse event of sepsis that was considered to be grade 4 (life-
threatening). Grade 3 (severe) infectious events were reported by 1 subject in the methotrexate only 
arm (abscess and sinusitis), 3 subjects in the etanercept only arm (infection, blood culture positive, 
and viral infection) and 4 subjects in the etanercept + methotrexate arm (abscess, infection, 
pyelonephritis, colitis, and urinary tract infection). 
The safety profiles of both the subpopulation and the overall population are consistent with the known 
safety profile of etanercept. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
There were 2 SAEs reported in polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years: 
Nephrotic syndrome in a 2-year-old female subject in the MTX only arm (who subsequently switched to 
the etanercept + MTX arm) and arthritis flare in a 2-year-old female subject in the etanercept + MTX 
arm which were considered unrelated to study drug. 
The exposure-adjusted rate of all SAEs for subjects aged 2 to <4 years was 2.75 per 100 subject years 
for the MTX only arm, zero per 100 subject-years for the etanercept only arm and 2.11 per 100 
subject-years for the etanercept + MTX arm.  
No cases of lymphoma, tuberculosis, malignancy, or death were reported in polyarticular JIA subjects 
aged 2 to <4 years. 
By contrast the exposure-adjusted rate of SAEs for the overall population was 4.64 per 100 subject-
years in the MTX only arm, 7.14 per 100 subject-years in the etanercept only arm and 5.98 per 100 
subject-years in the etanercept + MTX arm. The body system with the highest exposure-adjusted 
serious adverse event rate was body as a whole. The serious adverse events with the highest 
exposure-adjusted rates were viral infection (0.89/100 subject-years for the etanercept only arm), 
headache and arthritis (both at 0.63/100 subject-years for the etanercept + methotrexate arm). 
Fourteen (7.1%) subjects in the methotrexate only arm, 9 (8.7%) subjects in the etanercept only arm 
and 28 (9.5%) subjects in the etanercept + methotrexate arm reported at least one serious adverse 
event. Of these, 10 subjects had serious adverse events considered related; 1 subject in the 
methotrexate only arm, 3 subjects in the etanercept only arm, and 6 subjects in the etanercept + 
methotrexate arm. One subject in the etanercept + methotrexate arm had a serious adverse event 
(diabetes mellitus) that was considered probably related. 
There were no cases of demyelinating disorders in the etanercept only arm or etanercept with 
methotrexate arm, but there was 1 case of optic neuritis in the methotrexate only arm.  
In the overall population, no deaths occurred during the study. 
Laboratory findings 
Routine laboratory assessments were not a part of the study protocol. Physicians were to practice the 
standard of care for monitoring toxicities of methotrexate and other DMARDs. 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 39/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grade 2 through Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities that were not part of the symptom complex of 
another adverse event were recorded as adverse events. Two subjects had laboratory test abnormal as 
the preferred adverse event term, the verbatim terms were C-reactive protein and ferritin = 8, 
decreased iron studies. Other preferred terms (verbatim terms) that related to laboratory 
abnormalities were liver function abnormal (elevated liver enzymes), leukopenia (low white blood cell 
count), neutropenia (low ANC [absolute neutrophil count]), bilirubinemia (bilirubin total 1.8 mg/dL) 
and albuminuria (total protein 24 hr – proteinuria <928, normal 10). Other laboratory abnormalities 
reported were SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) increased, SGPT (serum glutamic 
pyruvic transaminase) increased and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) increased. Of these, only the 
decreased ferritin occurred in a subject from the etanercept only arm. 
Safety in special populations 
As this was a paediatric study additional safety assessment were made on growth and development. 
Growth data (height, weight, and body mass index [BMI]) were collected throughout the 3-year study 
period of registry 20021626. At baseline, subjects were below the expected mean for normal children 
(based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reference data). This observation is 
consistent with previous reports of impaired growth in children with JIA. 
Mean percentile and mean percentile change from baseline in height, weight and BMI were assessed 
for the overall population as well as for the subpopulation of polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 
years.  
In addition, post hoc analyses using standard z-scores were conducted for the overall population, as 
well as for subjects aged 2 to <4 years, as compared to the general paediatric population. 
z-Scores were calculated based on height-for-age, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age charts provided by 
the United States CDC website for children from birth to 240 months. Overall, the z-scores 
demonstrated height, weight and BMI in the overall population, as well as the subpopulation, remained 
consistent over the 3-year observation period.    
At year 3 and the last visit, subjects in the etanercept arms had a significant increase in mean height 
percentile change from baseline (p = 0.0385 and <0.0001 at year 3; and p = 0.0391 and 0.0347 at 
the last visit, Wilcoxon signed rank test). These significant improvements in mean height percentile 
change from baseline were also observed for each year in the etanercept + methotrexate arm. 
Significant increases from 0 in the mean weight percentile change from baseline were observed for 
each year as well as the last visit (p<0.008, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Significant improvements in 
mean weight percentile change from baseline were also observed for years 2 and 3 for the etanercept 
only arm compared with the methotrexate only arm; this significant improvement was also observed 
for the last visit. 
Significant increases from 0 in the mean BMI percentile change from baseline were observed for each 
year as well as the last visit for (p<0.007, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Significant improvement in 
mean BMI percentile change from baseline were also observed for year 3 for the etanercept only arm 
compared with the methotrexate only arm. 
For each age group within the overall population, including 2 to <4 year olds, the z-scores for height, 
weight and BMI were relatively consistent over time in etanercept-treated subjects. 
Tanner Scores  
The Tanner Stage Assessment and Pubic Stage Assessment were collected from a subset of study 
population and tabulated by age group. The absolute difference between the Tanner stage score and 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 40/55
 
 
 
 
 
pubic stage score was calculated. No apparent differences in development as assessed by Tanner 
Scores were noted for any of the treatment arms. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
One (1) polyarticular JIA subject aged 2 to <4 years withdrew from registry 20021626 because of an 
AE of vomiting. 
By contrast in the overall population 6 subjects experienced an adverse event that led to study 
withdrawal; 3 (1.5%) in the methotrexate only arm (rash and 2 cases of elevated liver enzymes), 2 
(1.9%) in the etanercept only arm (headaches with each dose and overlap juvenile dermatomyositis), 
and 1 (0.3%) in the etanercept + methotrexate arm (injection site reaction).  
Fifteen (15) subjects experienced an adverse event that led to investigational product withdrawal; 5 
(2.5%) in the methotrexate only arm, 1 (1.0%) in the etanercept only arm and 9 (3.1%) in the 
etanercept + methotrexate arm. The only adverse events reported more than once within a treatment 
arm were liver function abnormal (2 [1.0%] in the methotrexate only arm) and arthritis (3 [1.0%] in 
the etanercept + methotrexate arm). 
Post marketing experience 
Postmarketing Experience in Etanercept Patients Below 4 Years of Age 
Through 02 February 2009, relatively few events (n = 121 events in 38 reports) were received 
regarding children less than 4 years of age who received etanercept. While most events in this group 
were similar to those reported in all juvenile users, one of the most frequently reported events in this 
group included accidental overdose (n = 4). These reports included 2 errors on the part of a healthcare 
professional, 1 receipt of prefilled syringe instead of etanercept paediatric form,and 1 report of a child 
who took her father's etanercept prefilled pen and injected her right leg. As part of variation II/120 
(adopted in January 2011), the MAH improved the information in section 4.2 of the SPC and section 3 
of the Package Leaflet to make more clear to the patient that the pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen 
presentations are unsuitable for use in patients weighing less than 62.5 kg. 
There were 2 deaths in children under 4 with JIA. One (1) occurred in a 2-year-old female with 
interstitial lung disease who died of sepsis 3 months after etanercept was discontinued. The other 
death in this age group was attributed to cerebral hemorrhage in a 3-year-old female with a history of 
infantile convulsions and respiratory tract infection. She was hospitalized for hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy, secondary cerebral edema, and seizures and experienced a subarachnoid cerebral 
hemorrhage on the same day. The information provided was insufficient to make a meaningful 
assessment of the role of etanercept in this complex series of events.  
There was 1 report of malignancy in a 3½-year-old male who was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic 
leukaemia after fewer than 12 doses of etanercept (exact duration of therapy was not provided). The 
patient was treated with chemotherapy. The outcome of this event is unknown. This report does not 
provide information regarding the patient’s symptoms leading up to initiation of etanercept. Symptoms 
of hematopoietic malignancies may be misdiagnosed as JIA. Given the short period of exposure to 
etanercept, it is possible that the child had leukemia prior to initiation of etanercept therapy. 
The MAH was requested to provide a breakdown of post-marketing exposure by country by age and 
indication, with particular emphasis on JIA subjects under the age of 4 years. The MAH has addressed 
the question in terms of exposure in JIA using many data sources to provide information for the 
response.  The large exposure in children with JIA (~57,525 patient years under 17 years globally and 
~36,040 patient-years under 17years in the US) is expected to include children under the age of  
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 41/55
 
 
 
 
 
4 years since the licensing of Enbrel for children with polyarticular JIA from the age of 2 years in the 
US in 2009. Based on prescription information it is estimated that post marketing exposure for patients 
under the age of 4 years is ~733 patient years in the US. The additional post-marketing safety data 
since then is reassuring in light of the paucity of reports from children under the age of 4 years in the 
PSURs. The MAH will collect additional data on JIA patients under the age of 4 years treated with 
etanercept through the 3 available JIA registries: German JIA registry, Swedish JIA/RA registry 
(ARTIS), and UK JIA registry (BSPAR) as described in the RMP.  
Literature Reports of Etanercept Use Below 4 Years of Age 
A subgroup analysis was undertaken utilizing the German JIA registry to examine the safety and 
efficacy of etanercept in children with JIA below the age of 4 years. Twenty-five (25) patients, 10 with 
non-systemic JIA, were identified and had a mean etanercept exposure of 19 months. In this 
subgroup, 2 AEs (varicella zoster virus infection and fever) were reported. No SAEs were reported in 
these patients and no patients discontinued due to intolerance. Effectiveness parameters from the 
American College of Rheumatology Paediatric (ACR Pedi) criteria showed improvement from baseline, 
with statistically significant improvements demonstrated in most of the variables. Nine (9) of the 10 
children with non-systemic JIA achieved an ACR Pedi 70 response at last observation. Data were 
compared with that for older children in the German registry and with data from an open-label 
multicenter trial with an age range of 4 to 17 years in the United States. No major differences in safety 
or effectiveness were found. In a published survey of paediatric rheumatologists regarding etanercept 
use in children <4 years of age, no SAEs were reported. 
In addition, there were several publications that reviewed use of etanercept in children with JIA that 
reported 3 years as the lower age limit for inclusion. No specific information regarding the younger 
children was provided; however, the conclusions found the results of etanercept use in the stated age 
range to be favourable. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profiles of the subjects from the methotrexate, etanercept and etanercept plus 
methotrexate arm were similar, with no significant difference in exposure adjusted rates of adverse 
events, including autoimmune diseases, between the arms.  
The adverse events in the whole study population seem similar between groups. The total number of 
adverse events was around 18% in the MTX only and etanercept only arm and approximately 21% in 
the combination arm. The etanercept group had a higher rate of AEs in the category of nervous system 
(8% versus 4-6%) and in the Hemic and Lymphatic system (3% vs 0.7-1.7%). In the subgroup of 
children between 2-4 years, the etanercept group (only 9 subjects) barely had AEs. 
Regarding infections, no clinically important infections were reported in polyarticular JIA subjects aged 
2 to <4 years, whereas in the overall population, the exposure-adjusted rate of clinically important 
infections was 1.29 per 100 subject-years in the MTX only arm, 1.78 per 100 subject-years in the 
etanercept only arm and 2.05 per 100 subject-years in the etanercept + MTX arm. The number of 
subjects in the overall population who experienced a medically important infection was 4 (2.0%) in the 
MTX only arm, 4 (3.9%) in the etanercept only arm and 11 (3.7%) in the etanercept + MTX arm.  
There were 2 SAEs reported in polyarticular JIA subjects aged 2 to <4 years: nephritic syndrome in a 
2-year-old female subject in the MTX only arm (who subsequently switched to the etanercept + MTX 
arm) and arthritis flare in a 2-year-old female subject in the etanercept + MTX arm. 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 42/55
 
 
 
 
No cases of lymphoma, tuberculosis, malignancy, or death were reported during the study. There were 
no cases of demyelinating disorders in the etanercept only arm or etanercept with methotrexate arm, 
but there was 1 case of optic neuritis in the methotrexate only arm. 
At year 3, subjects in the etanercept arms had a significant increase in height, weight and BMI 
percentiles. Significant improvements in mean height, weight, and BMI percentile changes were also 
observed at year 3 for the etanercept only arm compared with the methotrexate only arm.  
Two deaths and two cases of Hodgkin’s disease occurred in the follow-up period but none of these 
cases were on Enbrel at the time of death/lymphoma. 
The CHMP noted that the approved 25-mg/mL paediatric presentation utilizes water for injections 
containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol as the solvent for reconstitution of the powder. A 10 mg benzyl 
alcohol-free presentation of Enbrel has recently been approved (EMEA/H/C/262/X/127, Commission 
Decision 29.06.2011). The other benzyl alcohol-containing formulation has a warning in the SmPC. In 
view of the availability of the new benzyl alcohol-free formulation and the SmPC warning, the potential 
safety concern relating to the presence of benzyl alcohol is considered to be addressed. In addition the 
MAH will review as part of the annual PSUR the post-marketing data in JIA patients aged 2 to 3 years 
on a monthly basis after the approval of JIA in children aged 2 to 3 years, until the new 10 mg 
formulation is available. The MAH will summarize these data in the PSUR. The reviews will focus on all 
SAEs with a particular focus on toxic and anaphylactic reactions as described in the RMP. 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile described in this registry study does not show any special safety concern within the 
well described safety profile of etanercept. To address general uncertainties of the use of an 
immunomodulator in this age group 2-<4 years, where the safety database is limited and no data on 
antibody development was available, the MAH will collect data systematically on the long-term 
outcomes of JIA patients under the age of 4 years treated with etanercept through the three available 
JIA registries (German JIA registry, Swedish JIA/RA registry [ARTIS], and UK JIA registry [BSPAR]), 
with particular emphasis on infection risk, malignancies, and vaccination as described in the RMP.

To further investigate the question of relationship between etanercept use and malignancies in children: European Pediatric 
Psoriasis Registry, Standardized Incidence Ratio Analysis of Cancer in Etanercept Treated Children with JIA using 3 Registries, 
and 2 Epidemiologic Studies to Understand the Background Risk of Malignancy in JIA. 
The below pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance are needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns: 
Description 
Due date 
The MAH will collect data systematically on the long-term outcomes of JIA patients 
31 October 
under the age of 4 years treated with etanercept through the 3 available JIA 
2011 
registries (German JIA registry, Swedish JIA/RA registry [ARTIS], and UK JIA 
registry [BSPAR]), with particular emphasis on infection risk, malignancies, and 
vaccination. 
The MAH will discuss with the investigators from each registry: 
  The possibilities of extending the registries beyond their current ending dates. 
  The possibilities of extending the age range to enroll patients from the age of 2 
years.

Description 
Due date 
  The possibilities of collecting data on vaccinations and vaccine preventable 
illness. 
The MAH will, after discussion with the 3 ongoing JIA registries, provide an update 
31 January 
on whether the collection of additional effectiveness data to optimize management 
2012 
of JIA patients following achievement of clinical remission with etanercept 
information will be possible.  This update will be provided in January 2012.  If such 
information can be collected then the MAH will provide information on this every 
year. 
The MAH will review the post-marketing data in JIA patients aged 2 to 3 years on a 
April 2012 in 
monthly basis after the approval of JIA in children aged 2 to 3 years, until the new 
PSUR 
10 mg formulation is available.  The MAH will summarize these data in the PSUR. 
The reviews will focus on all SAEs with a particular focus on toxic and anaphylactic 
reactions. 
3.2.7 User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable as the changes proposed 
for the package leaflets as part of the variation to extent the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
indication to include patients from 2 years of age were minimal. 
4. Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
To support the extension of the indication the MAH has submitted a study (based on data extracted 
from a registry) whose objective was to determine the long-term safety of etanercept with or without 
other DMARDs in paediatric subjects aged 2 to 18 years with polyarticular course or systemic JRA 
compared to a control cohort of subjects with polyarticular course or systemic JRA receiving 
methotrexate with or without other DMARDs.  
The beneficial effects of etanercept in older children from the age of 4 years with polyarticular JIA has 
previously been formally demonstrated to lead to a reduction in the number of active joints, and 
improvement in physician global assessment and quality of life leading to licensing of that indication. 
In study 20021626 the results from the subjects aged 2 to <4 years were similar to the overall 
population, thereby supporting efficacy in this younger age group. 
Although the data are derived from an open label study (based on data extracted from a registry) 
there is however a clinical need for other treatment options other than methotrexate in the very young 
children, as a considerable percentage of children may not tolerate MTX. Moreover, it is considered 
relevant to treat young patients with active arthritis vigorously, to prevent future joint damage. 
Alternative treatment options of high doses of steroids could cause growth retardation. As no 
alternative biologicals are available for young children the choice for etanercept may thus be 
unavoidable in 2- <4 year olds. 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 52/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The data provided in study 20021626 is supportive of efficacy in the age group 2 to <4 years but 
because of the open-label nature of the trial, efficacy has not been formally demonstrated. While this is 
not optimal, recruitment problems have affected other trials in this young age group. As the results of 
the subpopulation aged 2-<4 years in terms of efficacy were similar to the overall population with 
polyarticular JIA, these can be considered supportive of efficacy in this group.  
An additional area of uncertainty is when to discontinue therapy in non-responders. The MAH has 
provided an overview of the literature and guidelines available to support discontinuation of treatment 
in patients who show no response by 4 months of treatment. This additional change in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC is in line with the evidence provided and the ACR 2011 guidelines. 
It is also of interest to explore when and in what manner treatment should be stopped in a patient who 
has responded well to etanercept. Given the limitations to address this in terms of clinical trial design, 
the MAH provided literature data and analysis from trials in JIA to show that at present it is not 
possible to advise on how long a patient should be in a state of low disease activity or remission before 
deciding on withdrawal of the drug. In addition the high rate of relapse in those who were discontinued 
was noted, but also it is reassuring that the response to re-treatment in these cases was satisfactory. 
As unnecessarily long exposure to etanercept should be avoided. The MAH will therefore contact JIA 
registries to examine whether collection of additional efficacy (effectiveness) information to address 
this issue is possible as described in the RMP.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable side effects are well documented for etanercept, and highlighted in the SmPC and under 
continual surveillance as described in the RMP. These include increased risk of infection including TB, 
reactivation of Hepatitis B, allergic reactions, antibody development to etanercept, development of 
autoantibodies, blood scrasias, reduced vaccine responses and demyelination. Also an increased risk 
for the development of malignancies, including lymphoma cannot be excluded.  
Unfavourable effects of benzyl alcohol are seen in children under the age of 3 years and include 
anaphylactoid reactions and additionally in premature neonates, at high levels can results in infant 
gasping syndrome. Therefore, a benzyl alcohol-free formulation has been registered for Enbrel. As 
described in the RMP, the MAH will review as part of the annual PSUR the post-marketing data in JIA 
patients aged 2 to 3 years on a monthly basis after the approval of JIA in children aged 2 to 3 years, 
until the new 10 mg formulation is available. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects on a younger child may be more serious, in that children below the age of 4 
years are often naïve to pathogens including common viruses. This could result in more severe primary 
viral infections in these children than has been observed in older children. Another area of uncertainty 
is whether earlier introduction of immunosuppression will lead to an increased risk of malignancy, 
including virally associated tumour development. The ability to mount an immune response to 
vaccinations needs to be addressed. The MAH will collect data systematically on the long-term 
outcomes of JIA patients under the age of 4 years treated with etanercept through the 3 available JIA 
registries (German JIA registry, Swedish JIA/RA registry [ARTIS], and UK JIA registry [BSPAR]), with 
particular emphasis on infection risk, malignancies, and vaccination as described in the RMP. 
Assessment report for EMEA/H/C/262/II/126 
Page 53/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
For children who need treatment with etanercept and who respond to treatment, the benefit is very 
significant. With improved control of their disease these children will be expected to have a better 
quality of life and improved growth.  
The benefits of etanercept treatment in JIA for those aged 2 to <4 years is similar to that of the overall 
population from the study 20021626. Although formal evidence of efficacy has not been demonstrated 
as this was an open-label trial, the similarity of outcomes between the overall population and the 
subgroup aged 2 to <4 years were evident. The benefits of etanercept treatment in 2 to <4 years old 
with polyarticular JIA unresponsive to conventional therapy, result from disease control. As the 
underlying disease processes of polyarticular JIA in those aged below and above 4 years are the same, 
the efficacy demonstrated formally in those over the age of 4 years in terms of reduction in joint 
inflammation, can be expected to be reflected in those under the age of 4 years. This is confirmed by 
the registry data submitted by the MAH. 
Potential risks associated with initiation of etanercept in children as young as 2 years of age include 
the known side effect profile of etanercept as described in the SmPC and in addition may lead to a 
higher risk of severe infection and poor immunisation responses in children under the age of 4 years in 
view of the immaturity of their immune systems. These risks could be monitored and accepted in 
severe cases with polyarticular JIA unresponsive to standard DMARD therapy. The long term risks 
associated with immunosuppression also include development of malignancy, a risk which may be 
higher in the very young children. In view of this the MAH will collect data systematically on long-term 
outcomes of JIA patients under the age of 4 years treated with etanercept, through the available JIA 
registries, with particular emphasis on infection risk, malignancies and vaccination responses as 
described in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Taken together the available efficacy data and the knowledge about the safety profile, as well as the 
additional pharmacovigilance measures particularly the long-term safety registry, the benefit risk 
balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The well demonstrated efficacy of etanercept in JIA in those over 4 years led to the approval of 
etanercept in active polyarticular JIA in children aged 4 years and above. The underlying disease 
processes are the same for children under the age of 4 years with polyarticular JIA. The registry data 
provided by the MAH support similar efficacy in those aged 2 to <4 years as was seen in the whole 
population aged 2-18 years. While high quality trial data is usually required for an extension of 
indication, the difficulty in recruiting young children into trials for this disease has been demonstrated 
by the MAH.  This is likely to at least in part related to the fact that etanercept is approved in children 
with polyarticular JIA from the age of 4 years and in the US from the age of 2 years. The benefit of 
treatment in young children under the age of 4 with active disease, where no alternatives exist is 
expected to lead to a reduction in joint destruction and improved quality of life. The known risks of 
etanercept are highlighted in the SmPC and the RMP, but additional concerns relate to its use in those 
under the age of 4 years. The risks of infection and the possibility that the risk of malignancy will be 
increased relatively more the younger the age of onset of treatment remain concerns. These concerns 
will be monitored with long-term active pharmacovigilance activity as described in the RMP. The 
balance in a subject with active polyarticular JIA is in favour of treatment provided that the warnings in

the SmPC are followed and the subject is followed long-term for assessment of safety, particularly the 
development of malignancy.  
The benefits of earlier introduction of treatment with etanercept in polyarticular JIA patients aged 2 to 
4 years who have not tolerated to, have a contra-indication to or do not respond to non-biological 
DMARD therapy is expected to provide similar benefit as has been formally demonstrated in children 
aged 4-18 years. Long-term disease associated morbidity is linked to the speed of achieving acute 
disease control. 
Earlier control of resistant disease associated morbidity is expected to lead to less joint destruction and 
a favourable clinical outcome in terms of joint function, development and quality of life.  
Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit 
balance of Enbrel in the treatment of polyarticular JIA in children from the age of 2 to <4 years was 
positive. 
The following indication is therefore agreed for section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents from the age 
of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Enbrel has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. 
2.  Conclusion 
On 21 July 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

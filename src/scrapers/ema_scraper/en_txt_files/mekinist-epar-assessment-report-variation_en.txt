2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In the European Union (EU), lung cancer is estimated to be the leading cause of cancer death with an 
estimated 185,000 deaths in men and 82,000 deaths in women in 2012. Besides this, lung cancer is the 
fourth most common cancer in EU, with 214,000 cases in men and 99,000 cases in women in 2012 
(GLOBOCAN, 2012). 
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and NSCLC. Approximately 
85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma 
(including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) 
carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th 
Edition. 2011).

EMA/315207/2017 
Page 6/71 
 
  
  
 
For the majority of patients, NSCLC is diagnosed at an advanced stage with an overall poor prognosis. 
The overall survival (OS) for metastatic NSCLC is dismal with 5-year survival of <5% (Lindsey A. et al, 
2016). 
According to the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for metastatic NSCLC (Novello S. et al, 2016), in the 
absence of driver mutations first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (four with a maximum of six 
cycles) is recommended in patients with good performance status, based on the observed prolonged 
survival and improved quality of life (QoL). A comparable efficacy has been observed with several 
regimens including cisplatin and carboplatin combinations with gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel 
(Schiller JH. et al, 2002). The addition of bevacizumab to platinum-based backbone regimen improved OS 
in non-squamous NSCLC patients with ECOG PS 0-1 (Sandler A. et al, 2006). 
Recently, the anti-PD1 anti-body pembrolizumab has been approved as first line treatment in NSCLC 
patients whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥50% tumour proportion score (TPS). 
In case of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
rearrangements, approved target therapy agents are available. 
Treatment options currently available for patients with NSCLC who have experienced disease progression 
after first-line platinum combination chemotherapy depend essentially on tumour histology and the 
presence of specific biomarkers in tumour tissue. The cytostatic anticancer drug docetaxel, alone or in 
combination with ramucirumab and the EGFR TKI erlotinib are the only palliative treatment options 
available as monotherapy for an unselected NSCLC population (i.e., independent of tumour histology). In 
NSCLC patients with other than predominantly squamous cell histology, pemetrexed is also available as 
second line or as maintenance therapy after first line platinum-pemetrexed combination. In NSCLC 
patients with adenocarcinoma histology nintedatinb (a VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3 and PDGFRα, β tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor) has been approved in combination with docetaxel as second line therapy. The anti-PD1 
anti-body nivolumab has been approved as second line therapy. 
Despite the development of new anti-cancer treatments, advanced NSCLC remains incurable. The 
subgroup of patients with non-squamous NSCLC who benefit most from systemic treatment are those 
who receive targeted therapies based on the presence of a specific actionable molecular aberration 
(Barlesi et al 2016).  
BRAF mutations in NSCLC 
Constitutively activating mutations in the BRAF gene, first described in melanoma and then in lung cancer 
in 2002 (Davies et al 2002, Naoki et al 2002), appear to drive growth and survival of cancer cells that 
harbour them and are extremely sensitive to selective BRAF inhibitor therapy across multiple tumour 
types (Wan et al 2004). BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that lies downstream of RAS in the RAS-RAF-
MEK-ERK signalling pathway, also known as the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase and is a key molecular 
cascade that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The vast majority of BRAF mutations 
are V600 missense mutations, which lead to constitutive activation of BRAF kinase activity, resulting in 
MAPK activation and constant transduction of cellular growth and inhibition of pro-apoptotic signals that 
results in a malignant phenotype.

BRAF V600 mutations are most commonly seen in melanoma, but are also identified in other cancers 
(Davies et al 2002). BRAF mutations are observed in approximately 2% of NSCLC and occur most 
frequently in adenocarcinomas (Pratilas et al 2008, Cardarella et al 2013; Marchetti et al 2011). In 
contrast to melanoma, in NSCLC there is a large number of other activating BRAF mutations on exon 15 
and 11 (Tissot, et al 2016). BRAF V600E occurs in approximately half of all BRAF mutations in NSCLC. In 
addition to V600E, there are other BRAF V600 mutations, such as V600K, that also lead to constitutive 
activation and are sensitive to BRAF inhibitors. Preclinical data in mice suggest a potential oncogenic role 
in the development of adenocarcinoma of the lung for BRAF V600 mutations (Nuyen-Ngoc et al 2015). 
Non-V600 BRAF mutations often occur in the phosphate binding loop and tumours harbouring those 
mutations are not sensitive to BRAF inhibitors. 
The natural history of NSCLC harbouring BRAFV600 mutations is not completely clear due to contrasting 
results in the literature. Indeed BRAF V600E mutations in NSCLC have been associated with shorter 
overall survival (OS) and lower response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy than in patients with 
wild-type BRAF (Marchetti et al 2011, Cardarella et al 2013, Kris et al 2014). However, a report from 
Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium indicated that there was no difference in overall survival with outcomes 
similar to the general NSCLC population (Villaruz et al 2015), whereas in the Intergroupe Francophone de 
Cancerologie Thoracique (IFCT) database BRAF V600E mutations were associated with a slightly longer 
survival rates  when compared with BRAF wildtype patients. 
Importantly, BRAF mutations and other oncogenic drivers, including EGFR and KRAS mutations as well as 
ALK rearrangements, are typically mutually exclusive; this is consistent with the notion that BRAF 
mutation defines a unique molecular subset of patients with NSCLC who may benefit from treatment that 
inhibits the MAPK pathway. 
Dabrafenib and trametinib are licensed for the treatment of BRAF V600 driven malignant melanoma and 
target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of BRAF 
kinase activity which competes for the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) binding site in the kinase domain. 
Trametinib is a reversible and selective allosteric inhibitor of the mitogen-activated extracellular signal-
regulated kinase (MEK)1 and MEK2 and inhibits its kinase activity. 
The current application concerns their combined use in the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation positive 
NSCLC. BRAF V600 mutations have been identified as driving mutations in about 2% of patients with 
NSCLC.

The effect of dabrafenib and trametinib on the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways was characterized by 
Western blot analyses in MV522 and A375 cell lines after treatment for 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours. 
Results 
The combination of dabrafenib (10 nM, 100 nM, or 500 nM) and trametinib (5 nM or 20 nM) was more 
effective at inhibiting the MAPK pathway than both single agents. Dabrafenib at either 100 nM or 500 nM 
in combination with 5 nM trametinib showed similar effects. Cyclin D1 was reduced by the combination of 
dabrafenib and trametinib, but not by either single agent after 24 and 48 hours of treatment in MV522 
cells. The level of phosphorylated AKT was low with and without treatment of dabrafenib and trametinib. 
Apoptosis measured by cleaved PARP was observed in BRAFV600E MV522 cells after treatment with 5 nM 
trametinib, 10 nM or 100 nM dabrafenib for 48 hours or 72 hours. Apoptosis was enhanced by the 
combination of dabrafenib and trametinib (Figure 1).  
MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway western blot analysis after treatment of BRAFV600E lung line 
MV522 with dabrafenib, trametinib or in combination 
Both single agent and combined trametinib and dabrafenib inhibited the proliferation of the BRAFV600E 
cell line MV522 with single digit nM IC50 values, similar to what was observed in the BRAFV600E A-375 
melanoma-derived cell line. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Exposure and distribution of Dabrafenib and its metabolites: GSK2298683 (M4), GSK2285403 
(M7) and GSK2167542 (M8), in brain, lung, liver, kidney, and tumour tissues following 22 day 
repeat oral administration of GSK2118436A in female mice bearing A375P F11s tumour 
xenografts using MALDI-IMS and LC-MS (study 2001N127421_00) 
Method 
The primary objective of this investigative study was to assess the tissue distribution of Dabrafenib and 
its main metabolites GSK2167542 (M8), GSK2285403 (M7) and GSK2298683 (M4) in brain, lung, liver, 
kidney, and tumour tissues from female mice bearing tumour xenografts at selective time points (0, 2, 6 
and 12h post terminal dose) following repeat oral administration of GSK2118436A for 22 days at 30 
mg/kg/day. The tissue distribution of Dabrafenib and metabolites M4, M7, and M8 was examined by 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). Tissue

homogenate concentrations were determined by LC-MS.  
Results  
Extensive conversion (~90%) of M4 to M8 through decarboxylation occurs during the MALDI process. The 
LC-MS quantification data showed that, in general, M4 was present in markedly higher concentrations 
than M8 in the tissues analysed. Given that the conversion of M4 to M8 was shown to be consistent 
across a large range of concentrations, the signal for M8 detected by MALDI IMS was used as a surrogate 
for M4, and referred to as M4*. 
In the liver, at 2h and 6h, MALDI IMS showed that Dabrafenib, M7, and M4* shared a similar 
homogeneous multi-zonal distribution throughout the tissues with M4* being detected with highest 
intensity. At 12h, only M4* is still present at detectable levels. No drug-related material was detected in 
the liver by MALDI IMS at the 0h timepoint. In the kidney, M4* appeared to localize predominantly to the 
cortico-medullary junction, with highest intensity at the 2h timepoint and markedly lower intensities at 6h 
and 12h. Dabrafenib and M7 were detected at low levels in the cortex at 2h and 6h but were not detected 
in the 12h kidney tissues. No drug-related material was detected by MALDI IMS in the 0h timepoint 
kidney tissues. In the xenograft tumour tissues, M4* was detected at high levels in both 2h and 6h 
tissues. Low levels of Dabrafenib and M7 were also detected in the tumour tissues at these timepoints. 
Xenograft tumour tissues from the 0h and 12h timepoints were not analysed by MALDI IMS. 
Dabrafenib and its metabolites M4, M7 and M8 were quantified in brain, lung, liver, kidney, and tumour 
tissue homogenates from female mice using LC-MS to provide context for the IMS measurements. In 
general, the LC-MS quantification results were in good agreement with the MALDI IMS results. In the liver 
and kidney, Dabrafenib, M7, M4, and M8 were quantified at the 2, 6, and 12h timepoints but not the 0h. 
In the xenograft tumour tissues, Dabrafenib and the three metabolites were quantified in the 2, 6, and 
12h tissues and Dabrafenib, M7, and M8 were also quantified at the 0h timepoint. In all tissues examined 
with the exception of the 0h tumour tissues, M4 was detected at the highest concentrations, and the 
highest overall levels of M4 were detected in liver, followed by kidney and tumour. Low levels of 
Dabrafenib, M7, and M8 were observed in the liver, tumour, and kidney. Low levels of M4 were also 
detected in the Group 2 and 3 brain tissues; however, these results are likely due to blood contamination. 
Investigation into the distribution of Dabrafenib and its metabolites GSK2167542 (M8), 
GSK2285403 (M7) and GSK2298683 (M4), in brain, lung, liver and kidney following repeat oral 
administration of GSK2118436B to mice for 2 weeks as part of a 26 week oral toxicity study 
(study 2014N224534_00) 
Method 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the tissue distribution of Dabrafenib and its main 
metabolites GSK2167542 (M8), GSK2285403 (M7) and GSK2298683 (M4) in brain, lung, liver and kidney 
following repeat oral administration at a target dose of 150 mg/kg/day, of GSK2118436B to male and 
female mice for 2 weeks. Dosing was conducted as part of a 26 week oral toxicity study. 
Results 
In the lung, unchanged parent compound, Dabrafenib, and two metabolites M7 and M8 had similar 
distribution within the tissue, with drug-related material being primarily co-located in the blood vessels 
and supportive interstitial areas. This distribution is supported by the LC-MS data where the concentration 
of drug related material is much lower in the lung homogenate than in plasma, suggesting that these 
values may be due to the presence of residual blood, rather than penetration of the drug into the tissue 
compartment itself. M4 was not detected in the lung directly by IMS but was observed at a higher 
concentration than M8 in the LC-MS analyses of tissue homogenate.

2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Trametinib is an orally bioavailable, reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1) and MEK2. 
Dabrafenib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of B-Raf (BRAF) protein with potential antineoplastic activity. 
In the current type II variation application, Novartis is seeking approval for the combination of trametinib 
and dabrafenib in the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
Phase I 
Accounting for the 5-year survival of patients diagnosed with NSCLC, the estimated 5-year partial 
prevalence of NSCLC show that 318,611 individuals diagnosed with NSCLC within the previous 5 years 
were alive in 2012 in the targeted European region. The corresponding prevalence proportion was 6.2 per 
10,000. This 5-year prevalence estimate is likely to represent the upper range of the prevalence of 
NSCLC in the EU region of interest (EUCAN; Pagano et al 2010). 
Compared to melanoma, the frequency of BRAF-mutations is very rare in NSCLC and can be detected in 
only 1-2 of 100 cases of NSCLC. Furthermore, only approximately half of them harbour the activating 
V600 mutation (Kris et al 2014; Nguyen-Ngoc et al 2015).  
Using this information to refine the prevalence derived above for NSCLC, (i.e. a maximum of 2% of the 
6.2 in 10’000 NSCLC patients have mutated BRAF V600), results in a prevalence of BRAF V600 mutated 
NSCLC of 0.124 in 10’000.

2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The in vitro studies looking at both anti-proliferative effects and changes in signalling, apoptosis and cell 
cycle biomarkers indicate that a BRAFV600E NSCLC model behaves very similarly to a BRAFV600E 
melanoma model when treated with single agent and with combined dabrafenib and trametinib. The data 
presented are consistent with dual inhibition of the BRAF and MEK signaling pathways having the 
potential to benefit BRAF V600E mutation positive lung cancer. 
Dabrafenib and its three metabolites were well distributed into tumours with M4 being the most abundant 
of the dabrafenib-related components (maximum concentration (Cmax) ~7 times higher than that of 
dabrafenib). Cmax of dabrafenib, M4, M7 and M8 in tumours were between 0.3 and 1.8 times those in 
plasma (0.5 times for dabrafenib). The concentrations in the lung were low (generally 0.1 to 0.2 times 
those in plasma at 0.5 h post-final dose in normal mice; less in tumour-bearing mice at later times after 
last dose).  
The studies presented as part of the ERA have already been assessed in relation to the first MAA 
indication (melanoma) and the addition of a new indication (increased usage) does not change the 
conclusion that neither dabrafenib nor trametinib are expected to pose a significant risk to the 
environment. 
For trametinib the PEC remains below the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L and a Phase II assessment is not 
required. 
For dabrafenib, the Phase II Tier A risk assessment suggests no risk for surface waters, groundwater and 
microorganisms in sewage treatment plant activated sludge, with the highest risk ratio of 0.000244 found 
for surface water. Adsorption potential of dabrafenib observed in batch equilibrium studies with sludge 
remained well below the trigger level for a terrestrial assessment. The study on transformation in water-
sediment study showed significant shifting of dabrafenib into sediment compartments therefore leading to 
a Tier B risk assessment for sediments. 
Dabrafenib shows modest toxicity to the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus riparius and the 
subsequent risk assessment for sediment compartments resulted in a risk ratio of 0.0024 indicating no 
risk of this API for sediments. 
In a bioconcentration study in fish, dabrafenib showed very low bioaccumulation potential with a 
maximum BCFss of 4.38. 
Considering the above data, dabrafenib is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.1.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted is considered acceptable. Dabrafenib and/or trametinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
This application for dabrafenib in combination with trametinib for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-
positive advanced NSCLC is based on the results of a single Phase II BRF113928 study at the time of 
initial NSCLC application (data cut-off 7-Oct-2015).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.4.2.1.  Methods 
Analytical methods 
Plasma samples from study BRF113928 Cohort A (dabrafenib and metabolite) were analysed at Aptuit, 
Verona, Italy using two separate validated assays; one assay (Method VPT0224) to measure dabrafenib 
and its two metabolites hydroxy-dabrafenib (M7) and desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8), and one (Method 
VPT0225) for carboxy-dabrafenib (M4). These assays were previously used and discussed in the original 
MAA assessment for dabrafenib. The validation report was since updated with more long-term stability 
data. Cohort B and Cohort C samples from study BRF113928 were assayed at Covance, Madison, 
Wisconsin (WI). An assay was validated to simultaneously measure dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib (M7), 
desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8), and trametinib in human plasma (Method GGGHPP) and a separate assay was 
validated to measure carboxy-dabrafenib (M4) in human plasma (Method G83HPP). As sample analysis 
was performed at two different bioanalytical sites, cross validation was performed between these sites.  
Method VPT0224/VPT1817:  
Dabrafenib and metabolites M7 and M8 were analysed at Aptuit using UHPLC-MS/MS. Calibration range 
was 1 to 1000 ng/mL. Adequate between- and within-run accuracy and precision was demonstrated. 
Stability in human plasma was shown for 3 freeze-thaw cycles, in room temperature for 24 hr, and at 
-20°C for 12 months for dabrafenib and 6 months for the metabolites. Cross-validation with Covance was 
made by analysing cross validation samples (3, 50 and 800 ng/mL) in a minimum of 6 replicates by both 
Aptuit and Covance, using the validated assay appropriate to each laboratory. For all of the cross 
validation test samples the % difference between laboratories was less than 20% and therefore within 
acceptance criteria for equivalence of the results of the two laboratories. 
Method VPT0225/VPT1818:  
The dabrafenib metabolite M4 was analysed at Aptuit using UHPLC-MS/MS. Calibration range was 5 to 
5000 ng/mL. Adequate between- and within-run accuracy and precision was demonstrated. Stability in 
human plasma was shown for 5 freeze-thaw cycles, in room temperature for 24 hr, and at -20°C for 12 
months. Cross-validation with Covance was made by analysing cross validation samples (15, 250 and 
4000 ng/mL) in a minimum of 6 replicates by both Aptuit and Covance, using the validated assay 
appropriate to each laboratory. For all of the cross validation test samples the % difference between 
laboratories was less than 20% and therefore within acceptance criteria for equivalence of the results of 
the two laboratories.  
Method GGGHPP: 
Dabrafenib, M7, M8 and trametinib were analysed at Covance using HPLC with MS/MS detection. The 
validated concentration range was 1.00 to 1000 ng/ml for dabrafenib and metabolites, and 0.250 to 250 
for trametinib. Long-term stability in frozen matrix K2EDTA (-10 to -30°C and -60 to -80°C, respectively) 
was shown for 657 days for all analytes. Long-term stability in frozen matrix K3EDTA was shown for 225 
days. Freeze-thaw stability was shown for 5 cycles. The method was originally validated for K2EDTA. QC 
samples prepared in human plasma K3EDTA were evaluated to determine cross validation method 
performance from K2EDTA to K3EDTA. The results confirmed the acceptability of using K3EDTA as 
anticoagulant. Cross validation against Aptuit was performed by comparing analysis results for QC 
samples. Acceptance criteria were met.

Method G83HPP: 
Carboxy-dabrafenib was analysed at Covance using HPLC with MS/MS detection. The validated 
concentration range was 5.00 to 5000 ng/ml. Long-term stability in frozen matrix K2EDTA was shown for 
308 days in -10 to -30°C and for 682 days at -60 to -80°C. Long-term stability in frozen matrix K3EDTA 
was shown for 99 days. Freeze-thaw stability was shown for 5 cycles. Cross validation of method 
performance from K2EDTA to K3EDTA confirmed the acceptability of using K3EDTA as anticoagulant. Cross 
validation against Aptuit was performed by comparing analysis results for QC samples. Acceptance 
criteria were met.

Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from the phase II study BRF113928 in patients with Stage IV BRAF 
V600E mutant NSCLC.  
In Cohort A, subjects took dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily under fasting conditions. In Cohort B, Cohort C 
and crossover from Cohort A, subjects took the combination of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and 
trametinib 2 mg once daily.

Only sparse PK sampling was performed. PK samples were collected at study visits in Week 3, Week 6, 
Week 12 and Week 18. At Week 3, one sample was obtained prior to study treatment administration 
(between 8 to14 hours after the evening dose dabrafenib on the previous day) and a second sample was 
obtained 1 to 3 hours following the morning dose. For the rest of the scheduled visits, only one PK sample 
was obtained 2 to 14 hours after the most recent dose of study treatment or prior to the second daily 
dose on that day, i.e. samples could be denoted either post-dose or pre-dose for dabrafenib. Date and 
exact time of PK sample and of most recent dose were recorded. 
All PK concentration data analyses were conducted for the monotherapy cohort and combination cohorts, 
separately. No formal comparison was conducted between the Monotherapy Cohort A and the 
Combination Cohorts B and C. Standard summary statistics were calculated. In addition, the 
pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib and trametinib was determined using a non-linear mixed effects 
modelling approach. Post-hoc estimates of population PK parameters including apparent clearance (CL/F), 
Vc/F, and absorption rate constant (ka) were estimated, when data permitted. 
Exposure-response analyses were conducted among subjects who have PK concentration data from the 
Week 3 visit. All analyses were conducted for the monotherapy cohort and combination cohorts, 
separately. All analyses were exploratory in nature and included analyses of tumour response/PFS based 
on Investigator or IRC assessments. 
2.4.2.2.  Results 
Summary statistics of plasma concentration data 
Summary statistics were presented for pre- and post-dose plasma concentrations at all study visits (Week 
3, 6, 12 and 18). For results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis of these data, see below.  
Pre- and post-dose concentrations at week 3 were obtained within a relatively narrow time window (8-14 
after dabrafenib evening dose and 1-3 hr after morning dose) and summary statistics are presented 
below. The variability was high.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Data from Study BRF113928 were included in this popPK analysis. Subjects in Cohort A received 
dabrafenib monotherapy (150 mg BID) and subjects in Cohort B and C received dabrafenib (150 mg BID) 
in combination with trametinib (2 mg QD). PK samples were obtained at Week 3 (pre-dose and 1-3 hours 
post-dose) and pre-dose or 2-14 hours post-dose at Weeks 6, 12 and 18. A total of 146 subjects had 
measured plasma concentration data and were included in the population pharmacokinetic analyses with 
76 subjects who received dabrafenib monotherapy and 70 subjects who received dabrafenib and 
trametinib combination. The number of dabrafenib concentrations included in the analyses was 536. 
The previously established dabrafenib and trametinib population PK models were used to describe the PK 
data from this study and provide posthoc estimates of oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution 
(VC/F).  
An external validation approach was used to confirm the data from the current study were consistent with 
data used in prior analyses (primarily melanoma). The final model parameters used to describe the 
dabrafenib and trametinib monotherapy and combination data from study BRF113220 (GlaxoSmithKline 
Document Number 2012N144949_02) were fixed to the final parameter estimates (fixed and random 
effects).  
Trametinib popPK 
The previous developed trametinib model and parameter estimates to predict the exposure of the 
subjects in the BRF113928 study was deemed to not describe the trametinib data adequately. The data 
from BRF113928 was subsequently pooled with the previous model data and a study specific covariate 
was introduced on CL/F and Vc/Fm, see Figure 3 for visual predictive check of updated model. The 
updated model was fitted to the pooled data. Study effect was found to be statistically significant on CL/F 
(0.86 (95%CI: 0.80, 0.92)) and Vc/F (0.49 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.65)). The median post-dose (1 to 3 hr) 
trametinib concentrations levels at Week 3 in the current study were 1.21 times higher than previously 
reported for study BRF113220 for the same dosing regimen.

Dabrafenib popPK 
Dabrafenib PK was deemed by the applicant to be adequately described by the previously developed two-
compartment PK model structure including significant covariates of weight (CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F), sex (CL/F) 
and a small effect of the combination with trametinib (CL/F). Some parameters including Ka, tlag, power 
of dependence of CLIND,SS on absorbed dose (Alpha), T50, Q/F and oral peripheral volume of 
distribution (Vp/F) and the associated inter-subject variability, were fixed as the data collected in the 
study would be unlikely to allow accurate estimation due to lack of dose range and lack of samples 
collected during the absorption phase.  Visual predictive check is shown in Figure 4 and parameter 
estimates in Error! Reference source not found.

Effect of Race 
Race was tested as a covariate on CL/F of dabrafenib and found to be similar in Asians and Caucasians. In 
the dabrafenib dataset, only 19 (13%) subjects were of Asian race. However, the exposure in these 
subjects was within the range observed in other subjects (Error! Reference source not found.). The 
Applicant also provided a summary table of exposure data from other studies, indicating no clinically 
relevant differences in exposure between Japanese and Caucasian subjects (Figure 5).

dose) in Week 3 were available. The response endpoints evaluated were investigator-assessed ORR and 
PFS.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Only sparse PK data were collected in study BRF113928. The presented summary statistics of these data 
are not considered very informative, given the diverse time points over the dosing intervals at which the 
samples were drawn.  
Both the popPK model for trametinib and the popPK for dabrafenib show bias at high concentrations. 
Population PK results for trametinib show that CL/F and VC/F were estimated to be around 15 and 50 
percent lower respectively, compared to the previously reported values for melanoma patients. This is 
however not considered clinically relevant. 
The estimated model parameters show similar PK for dabrafenib as previously reported. Based on the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, the MAH suggests the inclusion in section 5.2 of the Tafinlar SmPC 
that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib between Asian and 
Caucasian patients. Although this conclusion is based on only 19 Asian patients (13%) in the dabrafenib 
Pop-PK dataset, the suggested comparable exposure is supported by independent data obtained in 
Japanese patients. This, together with the lack of differences with respect to safety between 
Asian/Japanese and Caucasian patients, warrants the conclusion that no dose adjustment is needed in 
Asian patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC).  
There were no substantial changes made to the information in the PK section of the SmPC. The proposed 
changes in the pharmacokinetic information of the SmPCs are of editorial nature and are acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed changes in the pharmacokinetic sections of the SmPC are mainly editorial and are 
considered acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The proposed dosing regimen of dabrafenib 150 mg orally BID (i.e., twice daily) and trametinib 2 mg 
orally OD (i.e., once daily) in patients with metastatic NSCLC harbouring a BRAF V600 mutation is the 
same as what has already been approved for the indication in metastatic melanoma, and has been 
selected on the basis of nonclinical data and clinical efficacy and safety data essentially performed in 
melanoma patients (See EPAR for WS-0736).  
The dabrafenib-trametinib combination regimen was assessed in the Phase I/II Study BRF113220 (a 
study investigating dabrafenib alone versus combined dabrafenib and trametinib (D+T) in patients with 
BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma).  
Study BRF113220 was performed to determine the optimal dosage of trametinib when administered in 
combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive stage IIIc or 
IV melanoma. In Part B of study BRF113220 patients were enrolled in escalating dose cohorts of 
dabrafenib and trametinib.

In Part C of this study the efficacy of two dose levels were evaluated in patients with BRAF V600 positive 
melanoma: dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily with trametinib 1 mg once daily (150/1 dose) and dabrafenib 
150 mg twice daily with trametinib 2 mg once daily (150/2 dose). The 150/2 dose was selected over the 
150/1 dose based on increased clinical activity. Data from the primary analysis of Study BRF113220 Part 
C showed a confirmed ORR of 76% and 50%, and median duration of response (DoR) of 10.5 months and 
9.5 months for the combination 150/2 dose and the 150/1 dose, respectively (Flaherty et al 2012b).

companion diagnostic). 
Treatments 
Patients with metastatic NSCLC harbouring a BRAF V600E mutation were enrolled into the three cohorts 
sequentially: 
Cohort A - dabrafenib 150 mg BID as monotherapy: patients were required to have relapsed or 
progressed after receiving at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen before enrolment.  
Cohort B and C – dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 2 mg OD: In cohort B patients were required to 
have relapsed or progressed after receiving at least one platinum-based chemotherapy but not to have 
received more than three prior systemic anti-cancer therapies. 
Patients were instructed to take dabrafenib at 150 mg twice daily, either as monotherapy or in 
combination with trametinib with approximately 200 mL of water under fasting conditions, either one 
hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Subjects were encouraged to take their doses at 12 hour intervals 
and at similar times every day. For combination therapy, subjects were instructed to take trametinib 2 
mg once daily along with the first dose of dabrafenib 150 mg as described above, while the second dose 
of dabrafenib 150 mg was administered approximately 12 hours after the morning dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315207/2017 
Page 25/71 
 
  
  
In all cohorts, patients were treated until clinical or radiological disease progression according to RECIST 
1.1 criteria based on investigator assessment, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal. Tumour 
assessments were performed every 6 weeks until week 36, and every 12 weeks thereafter (±7 days). 
Upon discontinuation of study drug, information was collected on any subsequent anti-cancer therapy, 
survival and disease progression if not previously confirmed. Survival and new anti-cancer therapy follow-
up were to be continued until a minimum of 70% of the subjects had died in each cohort or five years 
have passed since the last subject’s first dose, whichever came first. 
In Cohort A cross-over to dabrafenib-trametinib combination treatment after progression on dabrafenib 
monotherapy was allowed.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the BRF113928 trial was to evaluate objective tumour response rate (ORR) 
based on investigator assessment (according to RECIST 1.1) in patients with Stage IV BRAF V600E 
mutant NSCLC administered dabrafenib as a single-agent (Cohort A) and in combination with trametinib 
(Cohorts B and C).  
Secondary objectives included evaluation of duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), 
and overall survival (OS) in the three cohorts, evaluation of pharmacokinetics and safety.  
Exploratory objectives were: a) to explore the molecular mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to 
dabrafenib as single agent (cohort A) or in combination with trametinib (cohort B and C); b) to explore 
exposure-response relationship, tumour size measurements or other clinical or safety endpoints; c) to 
explore a circulating cell free DNA blood based test to determine whether BRAF mutation in cfDNA 
correlate with mutations in the tumour tissue; d) to explore cytokine and angiogenesis factors as 
potential soluble markers associated with tumour response; e) to evaluate ORR and DoR in patients 
crossing over from the dabrafenib monotherapy arm to the combination arm; f) pharmacogenetics. 
No formal comparison was conducted between the monotherapy and combination cohorts. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary study endpoint was ORR: percentage of patients who had a confirmed complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria based on investigator assessment. Patients 
with not evaluable (NE) or missing best overall response were treated as non-responders. The best 
overall response was the best confirmed response recorded from the start of treatment until disease 
progression, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or death, whichever occurred earlier. Best confirmed 
response based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment was also provided as supportive 
analysis, together with a concordance analysis between investigator and IRC assessment. 
Secondary endpoints included: 
- Duration of response (DoR): time (in months) from first documented evidence of CR or PR until 
documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first, in the subgroup of 
patients with a confirmed CR and PR. 
- PFS: interval (in months) between the first dose of study medication and the earlier date of disease 
progression or death due to any cause. 
- OS: time (in months) from first dose of study drug until the date of death due to any cause.  
Assessment report  
EMA/315207/2017 
Page 26/71 
 
  
  
If a subject had not progressed, was alive, and did not start new anti-cancer therapy, PFS was censored 
at the date of the last adequate assessment. Patients who had not died were censored at the date of last 
contact (as recorded in the eCRF). Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment for reasons 
other than disease progression, but do not withdraw from the study, will continue to have efficacy 
assessments (radiological) until documentation of progression or until the beginning of new anti-cancer 
therapy. Radiological assessment was every 6 weeks until week 6, and then every 12 weeks. 
All subjects underwent local screening to define their BRAF V600E mutation status as part of the entry 
criteria. Subsequently, the BRAF mutation status for subjects enrolled on study was confirmed in a central 
laboratory. An exploratory biomarker analysis was also to be performed. 
Exploratory analyses were performed in order to evaluate disease burden at baseline, time to response, 
maximum tumour size reduction, time to progression for the immediate prior anti-cancer therapy for 
metastatic disease, and lesion volumetric data. 
Sample size 
The sample size for each cohort was planned so that statistical power of at least 90% and alpha levels of 
less than 0.05 were achieved for Investigator assessed ORR. 
-Monotherapy Cohort A: The sample size was based on the hypothesized ORR for dabrafenib using a two-
stage Green-Dahlberg design, in order to enable early stopping for futility and obtaining more precision 
for the estimate of ORR. The monotherapy cohort was further expanded (amendment) to enrol 60 
subjects to provide a better precision of the ORR estimate for dabrafenib monotherapy.  
-Combination Cohort B: The sample size was based on the hypothesized ORR for dabrafenib and 
trametinib combination using a two-stage Green-Dahlberg design. The planned sample size was 40 
subjects with 20 subjects in each stage. This design corresponded to a type I error of 0.032 and power of 
92.2% to conclude that ORR was >30% from the data assuming that the ORR in the population was 
≥55% (H0: ORR ≤30%, H1: ORR ≥55%). 
-Combination Cohort C: The sample size for Cohort C was based on the hypothesized ORR for dabrafenib 
and trametinib combination in subjects who had not received prior systemic anti-cancer therapies for 
metastatic disease using a 1-stage exact-binomial design. The planned sample size was 25 subjects. This 
design corresponds to a type I error of 0.044 and a power of 92.2% to conclude that ORR was >30% 
from the data assuming that the ORR in the population was ≥ 60% (H0: ORR ≤30%, H1: ORR ≥60%). 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm study, therefore patients were not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an unblinded study. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis populations were defined separately for Monotherapy Cohort A and the Combination Cohorts 
B and C. 
- Monotherapy Cohort A:  
Assessment report  
EMA/315207/2017 
Page 27/71 
 
  
  
1- Monotherapy All Treated Population: all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, 
irrespective of their prior lines of treatment for metastatic disease. 
2- Monotherapy Second-Line Plus Population: all subjects who had relapsed or progressed after receiving 
at least one line of prior anti-cancer therapy for metastatic disease. 
3- Monotherapy First-Line Population: all subjects who had not received any prior anti-cancer therapy for 
metastatic disease.  
4- Crossover Population: subjects who were assigned to monotherapy cohort and elected to crossover to 
combination treatment following disease progression on monotherapy. 
- Combination Cohorts B and C:  
1- Combination All Treated Population: all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, 
irrespective of their prior lines of treatment for metastatic disease. 
2- Combination Second-Line Plus Population: all subjects who had relapsed or progressed after receiving 
at least one line of prior anti-cancer therapy for metastatic disease.  
3- Combination First-Line Population: all subjects who had not received any prior anti-cancer therapy for 
metastatic disease. It was the primary population for efficacy analysis for subjects enrolled in 
Combination Cohort C, but could also include any subjects who were receiving combination treatment as 
first-line in Cohort B via a protocol deviation. 
No formal comparisons between cohorts were planned. Each cohort had one primary endpoint (ORR) and 
the Green-Dahlberg design (cohort A, B) had one interim analysis on ORR for futility conducted by the 
independent data monitoring committee. 
ORR, DoR, PFS had primary analysis by investigator and sensitivity analysis by independent reviewer; 
this was on both the primary population (2nd line plus/ 1st line all treated) and the secondary population 
(2nd line/ 1st line BRAF V600E centrally confirmed). For the cross-over population, one analysis i.e. by 
investigator was conducted. ORR: subjects with unknown or missing best response were considered non-
responders. Exact confidence intervals were calculated. Time to event endpoints (PFS, OS, DoR) were 
analysed using Kaplan-Meier methodology.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 5 August 2011. A total of 46 centers across 11 countries enrolled 166 
patients. Patients were enrolled sequentially into the three different cohorts based on the number of prior 
lines of systemic treatment for metastatic disease. At the time of the data cutoff of the submitted CSR 
(07-Oct-2015), Cohort A and Cohort B had completed enrollment while Cohort C was actively enrolling. 
- In Cohort A, 84 subjects were enrolled between 05-Aug-2011 and 28-Feb-2014 and received dabrafenib 
as a single-agent, 78 of which as second or later line (Monotherapy Second Line Plus Population) and 6 as 
first line (Monotherapy First-Line Population).  
As per inclusion criteria, all subjects in the Monotherapy All Treated Population (N=84), except one, 
tested BRAF V600E positive by local laboratories prior to start of the treatment. This subject had wild 
type BRAF and was enrolled, however, a protocol deviation was not recorded at the time of analysis (data 
cut-off 30-Apr-2014).- In Cohort B, 59 subjects were enrolled between 16-Dec-2013 and 14-Jan-2015 
and received dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, of which 57 patients as second, third or fourth 
line of therapy (Combination Second Line Plus Population) and 2 patients enrolled as first line due to 
protocol deviation (included in the Cohort C for results analysis).  
Fifty five (55) subjects tested positive for BRAFV600E by local laboratory prior to the start of combination 
treatment. One subject had a V600 mutation (by a local lab which cannot differentiate V600K or V600E), 
and another subject had a T TF1 and CK5/6 mutation together with BRAF V600E mutation. 
- In Cohort C, 23 subjects were enrolled since 07-Apr-2015 up to 07-Oct-2015 (data cut-off date) and 
received dabrafenib in combination with trametinib as first line (Combination First line Population). 
The 23 subjects were tested positive for BRAFV600E by local laboratory prior to start of the combination 
treatment. Two subjects (8%) tested positive for more than one mutation in BRAF: one subject had 
BRAFV600E and V600K, while another subject had BRAFV600E as well as BRAF G469A and BRAF D594G 
mutations. After database close, both cases were queried. For the 1st subject, the method used at local 
laboratory couldn’t differentiate V600E vs V600K. This was recorded as a protocol deviation. The 2nd 
subject was confirmed to have only BRAFV600E mutation. 
A total of 16 subjects crossed over from dabrafenib monotherapy (Cohort A) to dabrafenib and trametinib 
combination treatment within 4 weeks of radiologic disease progression and are referred to as the 
“Crossover Population”.  
Conduct of the study 
The  original  study  protocol  was  amended  9  times.  Relevant  amendments  consisted  of  amendment  7 
(allowed expansion  cohort  A  with  additional  20  patients,  and  allowed  inclusion  in  cohort  A  of  treatment 
naïve  patients  for  metastatic  disease),  amendment  8  (added  the  dabrafenib/trametinib  combination 
therapy cohort [n=40], restricted to a maximum of 3 the numbers of prior systemic therapies allowed in 
cohort B, and allowed cross-over from monotherapy to combination arm after progression), amendment 9 
(added cohort C with 25 evaluable first line patients and expanded cohort B from 40 to approximately 60 
patients).

Baseline data  
Table 7.  Baseline patient characteristics - BRF113928 study (data cut-off 7-Oct-2015) 
In the combination 2nd-line Plus population, 6 patients were current smokers (11%) and 35 patients 
(61%) were former smokers, while 16 patients (28%) had never smoked. For the 41 current and former 
smokers, the median number of smoking pack years was 30 pack years (range: 2 to 94 smoking pack 
years). 
In the combination 1st-line population, most of the patients (15 patients; 60%) were former smokers; 8 
patients (32%) had never smoked. For the 17 current or former smokers, the median number of smoking 
pack years was 10 (range: 0 to 49 pack years). 
In the monotherapy 2nd-line Plus population, most of the patients (46 patients; 59%) were former 
smokers, 29 patients (37%) had never smoked. For the 49 current or former smokers, the median 
number of smoking pack years was 30.0 (range: 0 to 94 pack years).

Outcomes and estimation 
Cohort A: Monotherapy Second-Line Plus Population:  
Primary endpoint: ORR 
Table 11.  Summary of best response based on investigator and IRC (RECIST 1.1) for Second 
Line plus all treated patients in the monotherapy cohort – BRF113928 Study. 
Per Investigator assessment, the updated ORR after 6 months of follow-up from primary analysis (21-
Nov-2014 data cut-off) was consistent with the primary analysis: the updated ORR was 33.3% (95% CI: 
23.1%, 44.9%). 
Per IRC assessment, for those with measurable disease at baseline, the updated ORR showed a slightly 
improved response to treatment with an ORR of 32.8% (95% CI: 21.6%, 45.7%, 1 pt with CR (2%)).

At the time of the updated analysis (21-Nov-2014), the median DoR was mature with 77% of the 
responders progressing. The estimated median DoR was 9.6 months and 9.9 months based on 
Investigator and IRC assessments, respectively. 
Secondary endpoint: PFS

At the time of the updated analysis (21-Nov-2014), the PFS data was mature with 76% of the subjects 
having PFS events; estimated median PFS: was 5.5 months, 95% CI: 3.4, 7.3 for Investigator and 5.5 
months, 95% CI: 2.8, 6.9 for IRC) 
Other secondary endpoints: 
Overall Survival: At the time of the latest updated analysis (data cut-off date of 07-Oct-2015), with an 
additional 18 months of follow-up from the primary analysis, majority of subjects (55 subjects; 71%) had 
died. The estimated median OS remained at 12.7 months (95% CI: 7.3, 16.3).  
Time to response: Majority of the subjects (18 of 25 responders per investigator assessment) showed 
response at Week 6 (first post-baseline assessment). None of the subjects had an initial response after 
Week 36 from the start of treatment. 
Maximum target lesion reduction (30-Apr-2014): Based on Investigator assessment, 33 subjects 
(45.8%) had tumour reductions of ≥ 30% from baseline in the target lesions. As per IRC, a similar 
proportion of subjects (28 subjects, 47.5%) had tumour reductions of ≥ 30% from baseline in target 
lesions.

Updated results (data cut-off 8-Aug-2016) 
Cohort C of study BRF113928 finished enrolling 34 patients on 28-Dec-2015. Combined with the 2 
patients who did not receive prior systemic anti-cancer therapy in Cohort B due to protocol deviation, the 
efficacy data from these 36 patients who were treated with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib 
as first-line treatment were analysed and key results are provided with the responses to Request for 
Supplementary Information. 
At the cut-off date (8-Aug-2016), all patients had completed at least 6 months follow-up from the first 
post-baseline tumour assessment or had discontinued from the study. The median follow-up time was 
approximately 10.4 months. 
In Cohort B, at the data cut of 8-Aug-2016, the mature duration of response (DoR) of Combination 2nd 
Line Plus population was 9.8 months (95% CI: 6.9-16.0 months) with 71% of patients (27/38) who had 
progressed or died, and median PFS (mPFS) was 10.2 months (95% CI: 6.9-16.7 months) by investigator 
assessment with 72% of patients (41/57) who had progressed or died. 
The median overall survival (OS) was 18.2 months (95% CI: 14.3-NE months) with an event rate of 
58%.

Supportive study 
Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie Thoracique (IFCT) study 
The IFCT study provided contemporaneous real-life outcomes data for patients with NSCLC with and 
without a BRAF V600E mutation following treatment with available standard-of care therapies. 
The purpose of this study, which was conducted in France, was to assess the characteristics, molecular 
profiles, and clinical outcomes of patients who were screened during a 1–year period from April 2012 to 
April 2013.  
Of the 250 patients (1.4%) with BRAF mutations, 189 (1.07%) were determined to have a V600E BRAF 
mutation. Median age of the 189 patients with the BRAF V600E mutation was 66.4 years (range 42.9-
88.7), 57.4% were men, 69.2% were smokers or former smokers, and 88.4% had adenocarcinoma. 
Regarding patients with the BRAF V600E mutation, 65.7% received first-line treatment, with platinum-
based chemotherapy being most common (49.0%), and 42.9% received second-line treatment, with 
platinum-based chemotherapy again being most common (16.1%). 
ORR for patients with BRAF V600E-positive NSCLC receiving second-line standard-of-care therapies was 
20.8% (95% CI: 9.8, 31.7), excluding those who received BRAF inhibitor treatment.  
Also, ORRs for patients receiving first-line standard-of-care therapies were 30.3% (95% CI: 21.6, 38.9) 
and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.6, 30.6) for patients with BRAF V600E-positive NSCLC (excluding those who 
received BRAF inhibitor treatment) and for patients with NSCLC without any mutation, respectively (IFCT 
2015). 
Median overall survival (defined as the date of the molecular analysis assessment to the date of death or 
final follow-up) for patients with the BRAF V600E mutation was 17.2 months (95% CI: 11.5, not 
estimable [NE]) compared to 11.8 months (95% CI: 11.1, 12.5) for patients with no mutation. Median 
survival for patients with a BRAF V600E mutation excluding patients receiving BRAF inhibitor treatment 
was 15.2 months (95% CI: 9.6, NE).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
BRAF V600 mutation-positive  NSCLC is a rare condition, representing 1-3% of non-squamous histology 
of the lung. Due to the well documented efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in BRAF V600 mutation-
positive  melanoma, foreseen high activity in BRAF V600 mutated NSCLC, the expected low activity of 
chemotherapy and the small target population, the MAH decided to conduct a single arm trial that 
included three cohorts of BRAF V600 mutated metastatic NSCLC which were enrolled sequentially: first 
cohort dabrafenib monotherapy in previously treated patients, followed by combination therapy in 
previously treated patients and finally combination therapy in treatment naïve patients.  
It is not expected that safety would differ to a meaningful degree between melanoma and NSCLC and a 
randomisation between monotherapy and the combination therapy would have not been possible. The 
reasons for the implemented study design are understood in view of the rarity of the disease. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dabrafenib monotherapy:  The confirmed ORR in 78 patients was 32% (investigator) and 23% (IRC) 
(protocol defined primary analysis). After an additional 6 months of follow-up for patients with 
measurable disease at baseline per IRC assessment, the IRC ORR was 33%. Based on treatment history, 
the within response rate to first-line platinum therapy was about 30% (12/39). Median PFS (investigator 
and IRC) was about 5.5 months, similar to reported treatment history TTP. 
Dabrafenib + trametinib: In the second line plus setting the confirmed ORR was 63% (95% 49; 76%) by 
both investigator and IRC in 57 individuals. Median duration of response was found to be 9 months 
(investigator and IRC) and PFS 9.7 and 8.6 months (investigator and IRC) at an event rate of about 60%. 
About 80% of responses were observed at first imaging, i.e. at 6 weeks.  
Thirty-six subjects were evaluable for response in the first-line setting and the reported ORR was 22/36, 
i.e. about 61%. 
Results are considered as sufficiently convincing to conclude that combination therapy is efficacious. 
At a response rate of 60% and PFS of 9 months, relevant anti-tumour activity has been shown. Based on 
experience from NSCLC studies in general, this is highly likely to translate into symptom reduction and 
delay in symptomatic progression. 
Given the limited follow-up in the 1st line setting, the MAH is recommended to provide final mature 
efficacy results of Cohort C when available. 
The OS results of the IFCT study appear to support the hypothesis that NSCLC patients with BRAF 
mutations present a different natural history compared to patients with no mutations, as median OS was 
longer in BRAF mutated NSCLC (15.2 -17.2 months independently on whether a BRAF targeted treatment 
was given) compared with patients without mutations (11.8 months), independent of the treatment 
received. Moreover, the data available do not seem to indicate a clear OS improvement with the 
combination trametinib-dabrafenib in the BRF113928 study (median OS 17.6 months) compared with the 
“historical” IFCT database (median OS 15.2-17.2 months). However, it is possible to exclude a detriment 
in OS. . 
Exploratory biomarker analyses are currently being planned for the BRF113928 study and the MAH is 
recommended to submit the results of these “biomarker” analyses once available.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of the combination of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with V600 driven NSCLC 
irrespective line of therapy has been established. However the efficacy of Dabrafenib monotherapy in the 
treatment of patients with V600 driven NSCLC has not been established. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile for dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily in combination with trametinib 2 mg once daily in 
subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive NSCLC is derived from the Phase II study BRF113928 and 
consists of: a) dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy arm in second line patients, n=57 (Cohort 
B); b) dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy arm in first line patients, n=25 (Cohort C); c) 
dabrafenib monotherapy arm, n=84 (Cohort A). The safety results are also discussed in comparison with 
the safety observed for the approved indication in melanoma (n=559), which was based on 2 large 
randomized Phase III studies. 
Patient exposure 
The median daily dabrafenib dose was 295.8 mg in the pooled group of combination-treated patients, 
290.6 mg in Cohort B (combination second line), 300 mg in Cohort C (combination first line) and 294.8 
mg in Cohort A (monotherapy) of the pivotal BRF113928 study. The median daily trametinib dose was 2.0 
mg in all of the combination cohorts.

Adverse events 
In the pivotal BRF113928 study, AEs were graded according to the CTCAE, Version 4.0. AEs were coded 
to the preferred term (PT) level using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) dictionary.

Pyrexia 
In the BRF113928 study, overall pyrexia was the most common AESI reported with the combination 
treatment. Most of the events were mild to moderate in severity. Only one subject withdrew from the 
study due to pyrexia, and these events were effectively managed in a clinical setting with dose 
interruptions and anti-pyretics. 
In the pooled combination group of the BRF113928 study (Cohort B and C), pyrexia was reported in 39 
patients (48%), in 38 patients being of grade 1 or 2. Ten patients had pyrexia SAEs, but only one led to 
study withdrawal. Thirty-two patients had pyrexia events that were considered related to study 
treatment. Pyrexia was managed without dose reduction in the majority of patients (79%, 31/39), with 
49% (19/39) of patients requiring drug interruption. The median time to onset of pyrexia events from the 
start of combination treatment was 21 days (range: 3 to 416 days), with 31% (12/39) of the subjects 
experiencing the event within 14 days of starting treatment. No relationship was observed between 
exposure and pyrexia. 
The incidence and severity of pyrexia were increased slightly when dabrafenib was used in combination 
with trametinib (48%, 3% Grade 3) as compared to dabrafenib monotherapy (39%, 2% Grade 3). 
Bleeding events 
In the pooled combination treatment group (Cohort B and C), bleeding events were reported in 18 
patients (22%), with haemoptysis, epistaxis, hematoma, haematuria, and purpura being reported in 
more than one patient. Three patients had grade 3 events (haemoptysis, haematuria, and gastric 
haemorrhage), while two of the bleeding events were fatal (retroperitoneal haemorrhage and 
subarachnoid haemorrhage). Both of the patients with the fatal bleeding events had confounding factors 
such as iatrogenic coagulopathy and cerebral aneurysm, and the investigator assessed them as not 
related to study drugs. In 7 patients (39%) bleeding events were characterized as serious, and in 4 
patients the events were related to the combination treatment. Bleeding events were managed without 
dose modifications in 15 patients, while one subject required drug interruption. 
The median time to onset of the first occurrence of haemorrhagic events for the combination of 
trametinib and dabrafenib was 94 days in the melanoma Phase III studies and 63.5 days in the NSCLC 
study for the patients who had received prior anti-cancer therapy. 
Treatment-emergent malignancies  
In Cohort B (combination second line plus), one patient had a non-cutaneous treatment-emergent 
malignancy (hepatocellular carcinoma) that was most likely present before the patient started study 
medications. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CuSCC)-related events were reported in 2 patients. In 
Cohort C (combination first line) there were no AESIs of treatment-emergent malignancies or CuSCC-
related events. In Cohort A (monotherapy group), all treatment-emergent malignancies were cutaneous. 
CuSCC events were experienced by 15 patients (18%) and all were considered to be study treatment-
related. The median time to onset of CuSCC events was 78 days, and 80% (12 of 15) of the patients 
experienced the event more than 28 days after starting study treatment. None of the subjects withdrew 
from the study due to these events. All the CuSCC events were managed without requiring any 
dabrafenib dose modification. The most commonly used treatment was surgical resection. Basal cell 
carcinoma (BCC) was reported in six patients and in five patients these BCC events were considered 
related to study drug. 
In the integrated safety population of patients with metastatic melanoma and advanced NSCLC, cuSCC 
occurred in 4% (24/641) of patients receiving dabrafenib in combination with trametinib.

Skin-related events (excluding CuSCC, Kerato-Acantoma) 
In the combination treatment group (Cohort B and C), skin-related events (excluding CuSCC and KA) 
were reported in 24 subjects (29%), with rash (15 subjects, 18%) and erythema (5 subjects, 6%) being 
the most commonly reported. The event was considered treatment-related in 71% (17/24) of cases. All 
subjects with the exception of two had grade 1-2 events (2 pts had grade 3 rash). None of the events 
were characterized as serious, and none of the subjects withdrew from the study due to skin-related 
events. Only one subject required drug interruption and no other subjects required dose modifications. 
The median time to onset of skin-related events was 37 days (range: 1 to 253 days). At the time of the 
data-cut off for this analysis, the skin-related events had resolved in majority of the subjects (79%, 
19/24). The median duration of the events was 50 days (range: 2 to 347 days), with 95% (21/22) of the 
subjects having a resolution after 10 days. 
Diarrhoea 
In the combination treatment group (Cohort B and C), diarrhoea events were reported in 23 patients 
(28%), all being grade 1-2 events with the exception of one grade 3 event. The event was considered to 
be related to treatment in 74% (17/23) of cases. One subject had a serious event, and none of the 
subjects withdrew from the study due to diarrhoea. 87% (20/23) of these subjects did not require dose 
modifications to manage these events, while three subjects each required a dose reduction and drug 
interruption. The median time to onset of diarrhoea from the start of combination treatment was 21 days 
(range: 1 to 314 days). At the time of the data-cut off for this analysis, diarrhoea events had resolved in 
majority of the subjects (78%). The median duration of the events was three days (range: 1 to 42 days), 
with 60% (12/20) of these subjects having a resolution within 5 days. 
Oedema events 
In the combination treatment group (Cohort B and C), oedema events were reported in 23 subjects 
(28%), with peripheral oedema being the most commonly reported (19 pts, 23%). All subjects had grade 
1-2 events. The event was considered to be related to treatment in 65% (15/23) of cases. None of the 
events was considered as serious, required dose modification neither was the cause of treatment 
discontinuation. The median time to onset of oedema events was 42days (range: 20 to 483days). At the 
time of the data-cut off for this analysis, oedema events had resolved in the majority of the subjects 
(65%, 15/23). The median duration of the events was 23 days (range: 2 to 142 days). 
Neutropenia 
In the combination treatment group (Cohort B and C) neutropenia events were reported in 14 subjects, in 
86% of cases (12/14) were considered treatment-related. One subject each had grade 3 febrile 
neutropenia and grade 3 pancytopenia. In three subjects (21%) neutropenia events were characterized 
as serious. None of the events were fatal, and none led to treatment discontinuation, whereas in 11 
patients led to dose modifications. The median time to onset of neutropenia events was 62.5 days 
(range: 21 to 462 days). At the time of the data-cut off for this analysis, the neutropenia events had 
resolved in majority of the subjects (79%, 11/14). The median duration of neutropenia events was 12 
days (range: 7 to 170 days).

Hepatic events 
Hepatic events were reported in 12 subjects (15%), and in 83% (10/12) were considered treatment 
related. Increased blood alkaline phosphatase, increased AST, increased ALT, and increase GGT were 
reported in more than one subject. Two subjects had grade 3 hepatic events (increased ALT, increased 
AST, and increased GGT) and one subject had a grade 4 event (increased GGT). In 4 subjects (33%) 
hepatic events were characterized as serious. None of the events were fatal, and none led to treatment 
discontinuation, whereas in 8 patients led to dose modifications. Twenty-seven hepatic events were 
reported in the 12 subjects, with 5 subjects (42%) having three or more occurrences. The median time to 
onset was 33.5 days (range: 6 to 338 days). At the time of the data-cut off for this analysis, the hepatic 
events were resolved in 58% (7/12) of these subjects. The median duration of hepatic events was 29 
days (range: 6 to 128 days). 
Ocular events 
Ocular events were reported in 11 subjects (13%), and in 64% (7/11) were considered treatment-
related. Visual acuity (in 5 subjects) was the most common preferred term reported. All subjects with the 
exception of one had grade 1 or 2 events (one subject reported grade 3 visual impairment). In two 
subjects ocular events were characterized as serious. None of the events were fatal, and none led to 
treatment discontinuation, whereas in 3 patients led to dose modifications. Sixteen ocular events were 
reported in the 11 subjects, with 9 subjects (82%) having only one occurrence. The median time to onset 
of ocular events from the start of combination treatment was 63 days (range: 2 to 254 days). At the time 
of the data-cut off for this analysis, ocular events had resolved in the majority of these subjects (45%, 
5/11). The median duration of the events was 34 days (range: 4 to 73 days), with 83% (5/6) of these 
subjects having a resolution more than 10 days after the event. 
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis was reported in a total of 3 individuals out of 82 patients. One patient presented a grade 3/4 
pancreatitis. 
Pneumonitis 
One case of pneumonitis was reported 
Integrated list of Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
The safety of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib has been evaluated in the integrated safety 
population of 641 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma and advanced 
NSCLC treated with trametinib 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. Of these patients, 559 
were treated with the combination for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma in two randomised Phase III studies, 
MEK115306 (COMBI-d) and MEK116513 (COMBI-v), and 82 were treated with the combination for BRAF 
V600 mutant NSCLC in a multi-cohort, non-randomised Phase II study BRF113928.

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory findings of Cohort C have not been submitted due to the short follow up.  
In Cohort B, the majority of shifts in haematology and clinical chemistry values were grades 1 or 2, and 
no clinically meaningful trends in mean values were observed. Frequently reported grade 3 post-baseline 
values were decreased haemoglobin (6 pts, 11%), decreased lymphocytes (6 pts, 11%), decreased 
neutrophils (5 pts, 9%), high glucose (6 pts; 11%), high phosphate (3 pts; 5%), and low sodium (7 pts; 
13%). Grade 4 increases were reported for decreased leukocytes (1 pt, 2%) and decreased lymphocytes 
(1 pt, 2%), hypomagnesemia (1 pt; 2%) and hyponatremia (2 pts; 4%). No Hy’s law cases were 
reported.

In Cohort A, the majority of shifts in haematology and clinical chemistry values were grades 1 or 2, and 
no clinically meaningful trends in mean values were observed. Post-baseline grade 3 values were 
decreased lymphocytes (6 pts, 7%), glucose high (7 pts, 9%), phosphate (4 pts, 5%), and potassium low 
(2 pts, 3%). One patient (1%) had grade 4 post-baseline increased glucose and 1 patient (1%) had 
grade 4 low magnesium. One patient (1%) had both grade 3 post-baseline increased alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and grade 4 increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values. No Hy’s law 
cases were observed.  
ECG 
In Cohort B, of the 55 evaluated patients, 7 subjects (13%) had an increased QTc of 31-60 msec and 1 
patient (2%) had QTc increased >60 msec post-baseline. None of the patients had grade 3 shifts in QTc 
post-baseline (>= 501 msec), 5 subjects had post-baseline increase to grade 2 (481 to 500 msec) and 10 
subjects had a post-baseline increase to grade 1 (450 to 480 msec). Most of these QTcF increases were 
observed within the Week 24 assessment visit. For all subjects with the exception of one, the post- 
baseline changes in ECG findings were assessed to be not significant clinically.  
LVEF 
In Cohort B, of the 50 evaluated patients, 78% had any post-baseline decrease in LVEF, with 0-10% 
decrease observed in 52% of these subjects. Three patients (6%) met the specific protocol-mandated 
criteria requiring dose interruption (LVEF was >10% below baseline and below the institutional LLN), 
which was reported as an SAE. 
In the integrated safety population of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib, decreased LVEF has 
been reported in 8% (54/641) of patients 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In second-line plus population (Cohort B), the median duration on combination treatment was similar for 
subjects < 65 and ≥ 65 years (10.6 months vs 10.3 months). Adverse event profile as well as the 
incidence of grade 3-4 AEs was similar between the subjects < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age (48% and 50%, 
respectively). The AEs that were more frequently reported in the younger subjects compared to the older 
subjects (with a ≥ 10% difference) are: pyrexia, cough, peripheral oedema, arthralgia, dyspnoea, blood 
alkaline phosphatase increased, back pain, headache, hyperkeratosis, nasopharyngitis, alopecia, 
folliculitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, hair texture abnormal, hyperhidrosis, and malaise. The following AEs 
were more frequently reported in the older subjects compared to the younger subjects (with a ≥ 10% 
difference) are: dry skin, dry mouth, and constipation. 
In the integrated safety population of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib (n=641) 180 patients 
(28%) were ≥65 years of age; 50 patients (8%) were ≥75 years of age.

Gender 
In Cohort B, the median duration on combination treatment was slightly higher for male subjects than 
female subjects (10.7 months vs 9.1 months). Male subjects had more AEs requiring dose reduction 
(41% vs 29%) and dose interruptions (69% vs 54%) and grade 3-4 AEs (55% vs 43%). In contrast, 
more female subjects had fatal SAEs (11% vs 3%) and death events (15 pts (26%) and 8 pts (14%), 
respectively). The following AEs were reported more frequently (≥10% difference) in male subjects than 
female subjects: pyrexia, chills, weight decreased, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, chest pain, 
productive cough, weight increased, increased blood creatinine, haemoptysis, confusional state, 
dehydration, and pneumonia. The following AEs were reported more frequently in the female subjects 
than male subjects (≥10% difference subjects): diarrhoea, arthralgia, neutropenia, peripheral oedema, 
constipation, back pain, headache, myalgia, alopecia, dyspepsia, rhinitis, and urinary tract infection. 
Race 
The safety profile of the dabrafenib and trametinib combination by race cannot be compared in Cohort B 
due to the small sample size of Asians (4 pts) and African Americans (2 pts). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

preferred term and maximum grade in the combination population 
Dose Interruptions 
Adverse events leading to dose interruption were reported in 35 patients (61%). Of these, 17 patients 
(30%) had grade 3 and three patients (5%) had grade 4 AEs.  
The frequently reported (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients) AEs leading to dose interruptions were: pyrexia, 
neutropenia, vomiting, chills, blood creatinine increased, and nausea. The incidence of grade 4 AEs 
requiring dose interruptions was low (3 patients; 5%), and consisted of gamma-glutamyltransferase 
increased, hyponatraemia, legionella infection (each reported in 1 patient)  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has already been investigated in the context of procedure 
WS-0736 which extended the indication of both individual products to the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
Pyrexia was the most common AE in the combination therapy arms and this adverse event occurred in 
approximately one half of the patients receiving combination therapy in both studies (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC).  
Assessment report  
EMA/315207/2017 
Page 55/71 
 
  
  
 
Nausea, chills and diarrhoea also occurred in ≥30% of the patients in the combination therapy arm of 
both MEK115306 and MEK116513 with comparable incidences. ADRs that required special warning in the 
SmPC were new malignancies (cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, new primary melanoma, non-
cutaneous malignancies), haemorrhage, LVEF reduction/left ventricular dysfunction, pyrexia, deep vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), hypertension, visual impairment, rash, rhabdomyolysis, renal 
failure, pancreatitis and hepatic events (see section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
cuSCC was reported more frequently in the BRAF inhibitor monotherapy arms than in the combination 
therapy arms (4-10% for dabrafenib monotherapy and vemurafenib monotherapy vs <1% for the 
combination therapy). The incidence of Grade 3 events for rash, cuSCC and keratoacanthoma was also 
lower in the combination therapy arms in comparison to monotherapy arms (rash 0-15 vs 2-13%, 
squamous cell carcinoma 1 vs 5-10%, keratoacanthoma 1 vs 2-9%). 
Overall, the safety profile of dabrafenib (Tafinlar) in combination with trametinib (Mekinist) in patients 
with advanced NSCLC harbouring a BRAFV600 mutation appears in line with the safety aspects known for 
the indication of the combination in advanced BRAF V600 mutant melanoma. However, data in NSCLC are 
challenged by the relatively limited number of patients treated (82 patients) and the relatively short 
follow-up. Of note, the combination first line treatment group (Cohort C) of the BRF113928 study 
included only 25 patients with median duration of treatment of only 2.73 months.  
In  the  dabrafenib  monotherapy  group  of  the  BRF113928  study  (Cohort  A,  n=84)  the  most  frequently 
reported treatment-related AEs (in ≥ 20% of patients) were hyperkeratosis (27%), nausea (25%),  skin 
papilloma 
(24%),  dry  skin 
(23%),  pyrexia 
(21%),  asthenia 
(21%),  and  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (20%).  Most  of  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  (grade  1-2); 
32%  of  patients  had  grade  3  events  (essentially  CuSCC  (10%),  BCC  (7%),  asthenia  (6%)),  whereas 
grade 4 and 5 AEs were reported in one patient each (grade 4 hyperglycaemia and grade 5 intracranial 
haemorrhage). A total of 36 patients (43%) had SAEs, with the most commonly reported SAEs occurring 
in  ≥  2%  of  patients  being  CuSCC  (10%),  pyrexia  (6%),  basal  cell  carcinoma  (5%),  ejection  fraction 
decreased (2%), pneumonia (2%), and respiratory tract infection (2%). One patient died due to a SAE of 
intracranial haemorrhage considered treatment related by the investigator. 
In the dabrafenib-trametinib second line plus combination group of the BRF113928 study (n=82, Cohort 
B)  the  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  AEs  (in  ≥  20%  of  patients)  were  pyrexia  (42%), 
nausea  (35%),  vomiting  (26%),  diarrhoea  (23%),  and  dry  skin  (23%).  Most  of  events  were  mild  or 
moderate in severity (grade 1-2); 32% of patients had grade 3-4 events. The most common grade 3 AEs 
reported in >2% of patients was neutropenia (9%) and leukopenia (4%). All other grade 3 AEs occurred 
at  an  incidence  of  ≤  2%.  Four  patients  experienced  grade  4  AEs  (anaemia,  hyponatremia,  gamma- 
glutamyltransferase increased, and legionella infection). A total of 38 patients (46%) experienced at least 
one SAE regardless of relationship to the study treatment: 32 patients (56%) in Cohort B and 6 patients 
(24%)  in  Cohort  C.  However,  no  fatal  related  SAE  were  observed.  AESI  were  frequently  observed  but 
usually  were  of  grade  1-2  severity  and  manageable  with  dose  modifications  and/or  treatment 
interruptions.  
In the dabrafenib-trametinib combination first line group (Cohort C, n=25) AEs were similar to the ones 
reported in Cohort B. However, the incidence of AEs and AESIs was generally lower in Cohort C, probably 
due to the short follow up and the very limited number of patients treated. 
QT-prolongation  has  previously  been  assessed  in  a  dedicated  study  without  specific  findings.  In  the 
NSCLC  studies  there  was  a  single  patient  with  major  confounding  factors  with  per  se  relevant 
prolongation. Information in section 5.1 of the SmPC is considered adequate. The Applicant also took the 
opportunity  to  reflect  in  sections  4.2  and  4.4  of  the  SmPC  of  trametinib,  changes  related  to  QT 
prolongation that were implemented during variation EMEA/H/C/002604/II/0019. 
Assessment report  
EMA/315207/2017 
Page 56/71 
 
  
  
Intracranial hemorrhages have been reported in 6 patients in the melanoma studies, all with confounding 
factors. There were no reports in the NSCLC studies,  but  this adverse  reaction  remains  listed in  section 
4.8 of the SmPC and covered by the warning regarding hemorrhage in section 4.4. 
The  safety  profile  of  the  dabrafenib-trametinib  combination  compares  favourably  to  the  known  safety 
profile of the platinum-based doublet chemotherapy where patients experience ≥ grade 3 events in more 
than  85%  of  patients  with  the  most  common  ≥  grade  3  adverse  events  being  neutropenia  (>60%), 
nausea (9 to 37%), vomiting (8 to 35%) (Schiller JH. et al, 2002). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the combination treatment in NSCLC is similar to what has been observed for the 
melanoma indication. ADRs are considered manageable when following the recommendations in the 
SmPCs. 
Potential differences in safety of the dabrafenib/trametinib combination would be related to the indication 
for use. In lung cancer for example there is usually an increased risk for bleeding. This has not been 
observed in the submitted data however BRAF V600 positive lung cancer is almost exclusively seen in 
non-squamous histology where the risk is lower than in squamous cell carcinoma.  
PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 13.1 for Mekinist (trametinib) is acceptable. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.2 for Tafinlar (dabrafenib) could be 
acceptable if the applicant implements the changes to the RMP as described in the CHMP/PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report. Before the adoption of the opinion the MAH provided an updated RMP 
(v8.3) which was found acceptable by the PRAC rapporteur. 
The joint CHMP/PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plans version 13.1 for Mekinist (trametinib) and version 8.3 for 
Tafinlar (dabrafenib) with the following content:

abnormal or worse)  
Gastrointestinal disorder is a new important identified risk that applies to trametinib monotherapy and 
trametinib in combination with dabrafenib only. This risk is not applicable to dabrafenib monotherapy. 
Since only those safety concerns associated with “combination therapy only” (not with monotherapy) 
should be listed in this part the MAH was asked to remove “Gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, colitis, 
and GI perforation)” from the Important identified risks related to trametinib+dabrafenib combination 
therapy only. 
The safety concern “Drug-Drug interactions” was further specified between what is considered as an 
identified risk and what is considered as a potential risk.

There are no new studies proposed in the pharmacovigilance plan for either Mekinist or Tafinlar. 
MEK113707 (drug-drug interaction study) for Mekinist, a legacy study from the previous MAH, has now 
been included as an additional pharmacovigilance activity for the important potential risk “drug-drug 
interactions”. 
Furthermore the MAH has updated date of submission of final reports for several studies which is found 
acceptable.   
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks 
of the product.

The proposed risk minimisation measures for both Mekinist (trametinib) and (Tafinlar) dabrafenib remain 
sufficient to minimise the risks of the products in the proposed indication.  
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the Mekinist 
SmPC and sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the Tafinlar SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Changes were also made to the Mekinist and Tafinlar Product Information to bring it in line with the 
current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, 
storage conditions, Braille, etc…], which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as the changes are not considered to 
impact the readability of the PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is currently authorised for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.  
BRAF mutations occur in a low frequency (about 2%) in NSCLC, essentially in case of adenocarcinoma or 
mixed histologies. The V600 mutations are the most commonly encountered mutation in BRAF, 
encompassing more than half of the BRAF mutations, and act as driving mutations for the proliferation of 
the tumour and malignancy of the disease. 
Historical data indicate that the expected ORR to chemotherapy is low, about 20%, also in case of V600 
driven NSCLC. Therefore due to the expected low activity of chemotherapy, the well documented efficacy 
of dabrafenib and trametinib in BRAF V600 driven melanoma, the genetic link between BRAF V600 NSCLC 
and the small target population, the MAH decided to conduct three single arm trials: the first cohort 
enrolled treatment experienced patients and patients were treated with dabrafenib in monotherapy, 
followed by previously treated administered combination therapy and finally combination therapy in 
treatment naïve subjects. 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
In the Combination treatment with dabrafenib + trametinib in the second line and beyond setting, the 
confirmed ORR was 63.2% per IRC assessment (95% CI 49.3; 75.6%). Similar response rates were 
demonstrated in the first-line setting, 61.1% (95% CI 43.5; 76.9%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/315207/2017 
Page 68/71 
 
  
  
 
 
About 80% of responses were observed at first imaging, i.e. at 6 weeks, thus early symptom relief is 
expected. Median duration of response for the combination 2nd line plus population was found to be 12.6 
months (IRC). Prolonged duration of response, as in this case, is associated with delayed progression in 
symptoms.  
The historical ORR to chemotherapy was about 20% for second-line therapies. 
Due to the rarity of the condition, experience from melanoma studies and available response data in 
BRAF V600 mutated NSCLC, the results are accepted as sufficiently convincing to conclude that 
combination therapy is efficacious in the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The absence of control doesn’t allow direct comparison with standard treatment, in particular regarding 
PFS and OS. However on the basis of the high activity in terms of ORR and duration of response, and 
indirect comparisons, it is possible to conclude that efficacy has been established. 
Only patients with BRAF V600E mutation were enrolled in the studies. Extrapolation to other BRAF V600 
mutations was discussed in some detail in relation to the melanoma indication and was considered 
acceptable with the inclusion of further information in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is similar in melanoma and NSCLC despite demographic differences. The discontinuation 
rate was about 14% after a median duration of therapy of about 10 months, but dose 
interruptions/reductions (60%/35%) are frequent. From a tolerability perspective these rates are 
considered compatible with a moderate patient impact.  
Among SAEs, pyrexia is the most commonly encountered event 10-15%. Combination therapy reduces 
the incidence of newly detected squamous cancer of the skin, but vigilance is indicated (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC).  
The most common adverse reactions (>20%) for the pooled dabrafenib and trametinib combination 
therapy include pyrexia (45%), nausea (41%), vomiting (30%), diarrhoea (28%), decreased appetite 
(26%), asthenia (23%), dry skin (23%) and oedema peripheral (23%). 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety evaluation of the combination dabrafenib-trametinib in the BRAF V600 positive NSCLC 
population is challenged by the limited number of patients treated and the relatively short follow-up. 
The safety assessment largely relies on the confirmatory studies undertaken in melanoma, but the 
number of patients in these studies is still less than 600. Safety evaluation is also complemented by 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.

et al, 2002) 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Given the high level of ORR reported for combination therapy (60%), beneficial effects in terms of 
symptom reduction are unquestioned. Due to the single arm design, the effect on PFS and OS cannot be 
properly evaluated but a detrimental effect is considered unlikely. Combination therapy is highly likely to 
provide symptomatic benefit. 
Overall, combination treatment is associated with a high incidence of ADRs, including grade 3 events. 
However, the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment is considered acceptable and 
manageable. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has demonstrated high antitumor activity that is clinically 
relevant. The safety and tolerability of the combination treatment is considered acceptable and 
manageable. The CHMP considers that the benefit – risk balance of the combination therapy in the 
treatment of NSCLC harbouring the BRAF V600 mutation is favourable.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600 mutation is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

Extension of indication to include the combination treatment with trametinib and dabrafenib of adult 
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600 mutation. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the Mekinist SmPC and sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the Tafinlar SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and RMP (version 
13.1 for Mekinist and 8.3 for Tafinlar) are updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing applicant 
(WSA) took the opportunity to bring the Product Information for both products in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10. 
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex IIIA 
and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

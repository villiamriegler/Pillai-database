2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Obiltoxaximab SFL is proposed in adults and paediatric patients for treatment of inhalational anthrax due 
to Bacillus anthracis in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and also in all age groups, for 
the post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalation anthrax when alternative therapies are not appropriate or 
are not available. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Anthrax is a disease caused by the Gram-positive, encapsulated, spore-forming bacterium B. anthracis, 
which  is  found  in  soils  all  over  the  world.  B.  anthracis  exists  in  two  forms,  vegetative  bacilli  and 
endospores.  The  spores  are  remarkably  resistant  to  a  range  of  environmental  adverse  conditions, 
ensuring  long-term  survival  and  infectivity  [Dragon  and  Rennie,  1995].  Direct  contact,  ingestion  or 
injection  of  the  vegetative  bacilli  or  spores  causes  cutaneous,  gastrointestinal  or  injectional  anthrax, 
respectively  [Head  et  al,  2016].  Inhalational  anthrax,  the  most  severe  form  of  anthrax,  is  caused  by 
exposure to aerosolised B. anthracis spores. 
Sporadic outbreaks of anthrax, most commonly the cutaneous form, occur throughout the world in both 
animals and humans [WHO, 2017; Vieira et al, 2017; Pillai et al, 2016]; predominantly affect poor, rural 
communities in anthrax-endemic countries in Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East, and South America 
are  affected;  however  sporadic  cases  do  occur in industrialised  regions  including  countries  in  Europe. 
Typically,  humans  contract  anthrax  through  direct  contact  of  skin  or  mucosal  membranes  with  B. 
anthracis–infected  animals  as  they  are  slaughtered  or  by  handling  by-products  such  as  hides. 
Gastrointestinal  anthrax  is  contracted  by  consumption  of  raw  or  undercooked  meat  salvaged  from 
infected animals. Although direct contact with an infected cutaneous lesion can transmit anthrax from 
one  person  to  another,  inhalational  anthrax  requires  exposure  to  aerosolised  spores  and  person-to-
person transmission does not occur.  
Inhalational anthrax rarely occurs naturally in humans, especially in industrialised regions of the world. 
In these areas, laboratory sources of inhalational anthrax are a major concern, either due to accidental 
release or use of B. anthracis for bioterrorism. B. anthracis spores are readily weaponised and highly 
virulent and it is not technically challenging to artificially create B. anthracis strains carrying antibiotic 
resistance genes. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Anthrax is a disease caused by the Gram-positive, encapsulated, spore-forming bacterium B. anthracis, 
which is found in soils all over the world. Inhalational anthrax, the most severe form of anthrax, is caused 
by exposure to aerosolised B. anthracis spores. 
Once  inside  the  lung,  B.  anthracis  spores  are  engulfed  by  alveolar  macrophages  and  transported  to 
mediastinal  and  peribronchial lymph  nodes,  where  they  germinate  into  vegetative  bacilli.  Subsequent 
rapid  multiplication  of  the  bacilli  causes  haemorrhagic  mediastinitis  and  this  is  followed  by 
haematogenous spread of bacilli throughout the body (systemic disease). In the fulminant phase of the 
disease, the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) from macrophages triggered 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 9/113 
 
 
  
 
 
by bacilli leads to a rapidly deteriorating clinical picture. Anthrax toxins produced by B. anthracis have a 
key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Early in the course of anthrax, the anthrax toxins suppress 
innate immune defences, enabling replication of bacilli and preventing development of adaptive immunity 
through impairment of dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells [Liu et al, 2010]. In the fulminant stage, 
significant  levels  of  accumulated  anthrax  toxin  can  drive  the  progression  of  disease  by  causing 
haemorrhagic  meningitis  and  hemodynamic  alterations,  including  severe  hypotension.  This  results  in 
tissue hypo-perfusion, hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, even when bacilli have already been successfully 
eliminated with antibiotics. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
The median incubation period for inhalational anthrax in humans is 10 days, with a range of 2 to 43 
days after exposure to aerosolised B. anthracis spores, depending on the size of the inoculum and the 
immune status of the host [Brookmeyer et al, 2005; Inglesby et al, 2002]. Inhalational anthrax is a bi-
phasic disease, with an initial prodromal phase of localised infection characterised by flu-like 
symptoms. This phase has a median duration of 3.9 days (range: 3.5 to 4.4 days) but then transitions 
abruptly to the fulminant phase of systemic illness [Holty et al, 2006]. 
During the initial prodromal phase of localised infection, symptoms include a low-grade fever, malaise 
and a non-productive cough. These may be accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as dizziness, 
visual changes or syncope. The transition to systemic infection is accompanied by a high fever, 
dyspnoea, diaphoresis, and shock. 
The fulminant stage of the disease involves bacteraemia with vascular damage, cardiovascular 
collapse, meningitis, and injury to various vital organs [Abramova et al, 1993; Guarner et al, 2003; 
Hicks et al, 2012]. Inhalational anthrax is a life-threatening disease, with an overall mortality rate of 
approximately 50% even with aggressive treatment including multiple antimicrobials [Jernigan et al, 
2002]. Patients who progress to the fulminant stage of inhalational anthrax have a mortality rate of 
97%, regardless of the treatment they receive [Holty et al, 2006]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, the main treatment for suspected or confirmed inhalational anthrax is antibiotic therapy 
[EMA, 2014]. Antibiotics are also recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals with 
suspected or confirmed exposure to B. anthracis. In some cases, immunisation with anthrax vaccines 
is recommended, and this may reduce the duration of post-exposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment. 
Two additional approaches for treatment of inhalational anthrax are currently not authorised in the EU: 
passive immunisation with anthrax immunoglobulins, and antitoxin therapy with monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) targeting anthrax toxins. 
•  Antibiotic treatment 
Three antibiotics are specifically licensed for anthrax in humans in Europe: ciprofloxacin, 
levofloxacin and benzylpenicillin.  
  Ciprofloxacin is licensed for post-exposure prophylaxis and curative treatment of inhalational 
anthrax in children, adolescents and adults. Oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid (or 10-15 mg/kg in 
children) for 60 days is recommended to prevent inhalational anthrax in humans, starting as 
soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure. At least 60 days of prophylaxis after 
exposure to B. anthracis spores is recommended because the spores can potentially remain 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 10/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
dormant for up to 60 days before they are activated. For treatment of inhalational anthrax, it is 
recommended that the treating physician refer to national and /or international consensus 
documents. 
  Levofloxacin is licensed for post-exposure prophylaxis and curative treatment of inhalational 
anthrax, based on in-vitro susceptibility and animal data, together with limited human data. 
Dosing recommendations are similar, including reference to national and /or international 
consensus documents for the treatment of inhalational anthrax.  
  Benzylpenicillin is licensed for the treatment of B. anthracis infections but no specific 
recommendations are made in the SmPC. 
Ciprofloxacin is recommended as a first line treatment of inhalational anthrax in all age groups [EMA, 
2014], and as an alternative for oral follow-up. In addition, the EMA recommends ciprofloxacin as a 
first line prophylaxis until susceptibility to other agents has been confirmed. Other quinolones 
(ofloxacin and levofloxacin) can be used as alternative treatment options but dose recommendations 
are only available for adults. Doxycycline and penicillin provide treatment options when susceptibility 
has been confirmed although penicillin is not bactericidal against B. anthracis. 
Natural resistance of B. anthracis is known for several antibiotics, including sulfamethoxazole, 
trimethoprim, cefuroxime, cefotaxime sodium, aztreonam, and ceftazidime. They should not be used 
for treatment or prophylaxis of anthrax infection [Inglesby et al, 2002]. 
•  Active immunisation (anthrax vaccines) 
Currently two anthrax vaccines, anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) and anthrax vaccine precipitated 
(AVP), are approved in the US and/or certain European countries but are not approved for widespread 
use in the EU. 
  BioThrax 
BioThrax and was approved in July 2013 in Germany. In April 2018, it was approved in five additional 
EU member states (Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom [UK] and France) via mutual 
recognition procedure [e.g. MHRA, BioThrax SPC-PIL, 2018]. AVA is indicated for the prevention of 
disease caused by B. anthracis in adults at risk of exposure.  
  AVP  
AVP (which has no brand name) has been licensed since September 1991 in the UK [MHRA, Anthrax 
Vaccine SPC-PIL, 2015]. It is approved for prophylaxis in circumstances where exposure to B. 
anthracis may be expected or anticipated. 
In addition to the pre-exposure use of these vaccines, the EMA guidance also recommends anthrax 
vaccines in certain circumstances for post-exposure immunisation in adults and children, in addition to 
antimicrobial treatment. With post-exposure vaccination, the need for antibiotic post-exposure 
prophylaxis can be reduced to 4 weeks. 
•  Passive immunisation 
A polyclonal immunoglobulin against protective antigen (PA) (Anthrax Immune Globulin, Intravenous; 
AIGIV, trade name Anthrasil) is licensed in the US for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in adults 
and paediatric patients, in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. However, AIGIV is not 
authorised in the EU, and is not listed in the EMA guidance regarding the treatment of inhalational 
anthrax [EMA, 2014]. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 11/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Antitoxin therapy 
  Raxibacumab 
Raxibacumab is authorised in the US for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with 
inhalational anthrax due to B. anthracis in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, and for 
prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate 
[FDA, raxibacumab USPI, 2018]. 
Currently, there is no antitoxin treatment authorised in the EU for the treatment of inhalational 
anthrax. 
About the product 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following considerations: 
• 
• 
Inhalational anthrax from bioterrorism has to date not yet occurred in the EU and the likelihood 
of such an event cannot be judged. 
The evidence on efficacy is based on animal models only, which carries inherently higher 
uncertainties compared to a situation where clinical efficacy data in humans are available. 
•  Currently there are available therapies that can be used for the treatment of inhalational 
anthrax and vaccines are available that could be used for prophylaxis in combination with 
antibiotics.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of the above-mentioned Regulation based on:  
• 
Inability to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of the indication.  
Inhalational anthrax is encountered very rarely and as an infectious disease, it is sporadic making it 
impossible to predict when and where it will occur.  
• 
Inability to collect such information because it would be contrary to medical ethics. 
Due to the high mortality rate even with standard of care and the anticipated clinical benefit, it would 
be highly unethical to conduct randomised controlled clinical studies with obiltoxaximab in patients with 
inhalational anthrax. 
Furthermore, the applicant considers that conditional approval is not appropriate for obiltoxaximab, as 
it is very unlikely that a comprehensive data package can be generated for obiltoxaximab in the future. 
This is because there is no possibility to conduct prospective randomised controlled clinical studies with 
obiltoxaximab in patients with inhalational anthrax disease and the opportunity for data collections is 
limited to open-label single-arm field studies with retrospective elements that can only be conducted 
upon the occurrence of an anthrax outbreak.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
The finished product Obiltoxaximab SFL is presented as a 6.0ml concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 100mg/ml of obiltoxaximab as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: histidine, sorbitol, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), 
sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections.  
The product is available in a Type 1 glass vial with rubber stopper and a polypropylene cap with 
aluminium seal.  
2.2.1.  Active substance 
General information 
Obiltoxaximab (INN) is an affinity enhanced deimmunised anti-anthrax protective antigen (PA) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG1κ isotype. The VH and VL antibody gene sequences of 
obiltoxaximab were engineered from the murine mAb 14B7, originally developed by the United States 
Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. The molecule consists of two Heavy Chains 
and two Light Kappa (κ) Chains. Glycosylation is only at one amino acid site on the heavy chain: Asn 
(residue 299). The relative molecular mass (glycosylated) is 148.1-148.6 kDa. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturer of the active substance is Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Lonza Portsmouth, USA). A batch of 
active substance is defined as the material purified from one production bioreactor, cultivated from a 
single working cell bank (WCB) vial of murine GS-NS0 cells. Cells are cultured in a chemically defined 
medium  which  is  free  of  animal  derived  components.  The  upstream  and  downstream  manufacturing 
processes  are  typical  for  a  therapeutic  mAb  active  substance  preparation.  After  fed-batch  cell  culture 
(inoculum  expansion,  fermentation)  and  primary  recovery  through  centrifugation,  purification  is 
performed  by  Protein  A  Affinity  Chromatography,  Low  pH  Virus  Inactivation,  Post-Protein  A 
Ultrafiltration/Diafiltration  (UF/DF),  Anion  Exchange  Chromatography,  CHT  Chromatography,  Virus 
Reduction Filtration, Post-Virus-Reduction UF/DF and Final Concentration, excipient addition and a final 
0.2 μm filtration into sterile active substance containers. Bulk purified active substance is tested against 
the specification. Following testing and review of batch records, the obiltoxaximab active substance is 
released and shipped to a designated storage facility for storage at the recommended storage condition 
of -80°C, until further processing into obiltoxaximab finished product.  
Control of materials 
Details of developmental genetics and the establishment of the cell bank system have been provided, in 
line  with  ICH  Q5B.  Obiltoxaximab  is  produced  from  a  recombinant  DNA-derived  murine  myeloma  cell 
line (NS0). From the clone, a master seed bank was generated and consequently expanded to a working 
cell bank. The generation and characterisation of the cell banking system is performed according to the 
ICH  Q5A  requirements.  Cell  bank  stability,  phenotypic  and  genotypic  characterisation  including 
adventitious agents safety evaluation of the cell bank were investigated during process validation. Pre-
harvest and end of production cell bank (EPCB) testing was performed for the extended generation lot 
and genetic characterisation was performed on the WCB and EPCBs  from three active substance lots. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 13/113 
 
 
  
 
 
The stability of the genetic construct at the limit of in vitro cell age was evaluated. The light and heavy 
chain copy number remains stable. The evaluation of the final purified protein out of the end of production 
cell line was performed. A limit of in vitro cell age is a generation number has been proposed. The end 
of production cells are free of bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma and adventitious agents. The analysis also 
demonstrates that the cell line produces a xenotropic, amphotropic or Mink Cell Focus-Forming (MCF) 
Murine Leukemia Retrovirus (MLV). This is expected for NS0-cells. Virus testing is performed on each 
unprocessed bulk and acceptable retrovirus reduction has been provided for the manufacturing process 
and a satisfactory safety margin was presented for retrovirus. The risk of transmission of retrovirus is 
therefore considered negligible. Specification for future WCB has been provided and a full panel of virus 
tests  is  included  as  expected  since  complete  panel  of  virus  test  was  not  performed  on  the  MCB.  The 
choice of test is in accordance with ICH Q5A  
No animal or human derived materials are used during the obiltoxaximab active substance manufacturing 
process.  All  materials  are  sourced  from  approved  suppliers  and  purchased  of  a  grade  suitable  for 
manufacturing  and  tested  to  standards  appropriate for  their  intended  use.  For  non-compendial  grade 
material  specifications  and  tests  are  provided.  These  specifications  are  integrated  into  the  facility’s 
Quality Management System.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical  process  parameters  (CPP),  key  process  performance  parameters  (KPP)  and  critical  quality 
attributes (CQA) have assigned acceptance criteria. Potential CPPs and KPPs and their acceptable ranges 
were identified by gap analysis, risk assessment, literature data, historical data, process limit evaluation 
studies (PLE) and process characterisation studies. The overall approach is acceptable. It is concluded 
that  key  and  critical  process  parameters  have  been  appropriately  identified  and  that  the  ranges 
(“acceptable criteria”) proposed are adequately supported.  
The manufacturing process is in general sufficiently described and the overall control strategy (including 
in  process  controls,  testing  of  starting  material,  monitoring  of  process  parameters  etc)  and  the  risk 
mitigation measures are in general adequate to control the process leading to an active substance of 
intended and consistent quality.  
There are no intermediates isolated during the manufacture of the active substance. 
Process validation 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  appropriately  validated  following  a  traditional 
approach. The process validation (PV) lots meet all CQA´s. The results of CPP´s and KPP´s were within 
the acceptable ranges. Removal of process and product-related impurities were adequately investigated. 
Re-processing was validated at small scale in triplicate for the virus reduction filtration step and the bulk 
fill using final formulation material from three PV lots.  
The hold times of intermediates (in-process bulk solutions) were validated. The hold times defined in the 
manufacturing description are equivalent to or lower than the qualified hold times. Small scale lifetime 
studies were performed for the chromatography resins. The re-use UF membranes were validated.  
The  validated  state  of  the  process  is  maintained  with  an  ongoing  process  verification  program.  This 
approach is also endorsed.  
Manufacturing process development 
Changes to the manufacturing process and site during development have been described. Comparability 
studies were performed following each change in the manufacturing process. The overall upstream and 
downstream  changes  were  clearly  described.  The  comparability  studies  demonstrate  that  the  active 
substance manufactured at different stages are comparable.  
EMA/524933/2020

Characterisation  
The characterisation included the determination of physicochemical properties such as molecular mass, 
charged profile, glycosylation, sialic acid content, posttranslational modifications, purity, impurities and 
biological activity. In general, state-of-the-art methods were applied and most relevant characteristics 
have been evaluated. The primary structure was determined with N-Terminal and C-Terminal sequencing 
and peptide mapping. Obiltoxaximab exhibits properties representative of a de-immunised IgG1 murine 
mAb containing heavy and light chains bound by disulfide linkages with typical levels of heterogeneity in 
its mass, glycosylation, and charge profiles. The molecular mass of obiltoxaximab was determined both 
by  MALDI-TOF  MS  and  ESI-MS.  The  masses  of  the  intact  protein  agreed  with  the  theoretical  masses 
calculated for the mAb with expected glycosylations. Glycoforms at ASN-299 contain several related N-
linked glycan structures.  
Obiltoxaximab binds to its target antigen which results in neutralisation of the anthrax toxin. Product 
potency has been confirmed.  
The  process-related  impurities  are  controlled  in  the  active  substance  specification.  The  information 
regarding process-related impurities is found acceptable. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
Specifications were set in accordance with ICH Q6B and includes tests for identity, purity, content, and 
potency.  
Statistical  analyses  were  used  to  set  acceptance  limits  for  several  attributes.  The  proposed  active 
substance specification is adequate.  
Analytical methods 
Brief descriptions of the analytical methods are provided. The methods are adequate to control the active 
substance on a routine basis. Analytical validation has been conducted in accordance with guideline ICH 
Q2(R1) recommendations and for each method, the required characteristics were evaluated. Full method 
verification  and  method  validation  reports  are  provided  and  show  that  the  analytical  methods  are 
considered validated with respect to accuracy, precision, specificity, and linearity. The defined ranges 
cover the acceptance criteria in the proposed specifications.  
The  potency  of  the  active  substance  is  determined using  a  functional  activity  assay,  the  Lethal  Toxin 
Neutralisation Assay (LNA). Cell death is measured using murine monocyte-macrophage cells exposed 
to  the  lethal  toxin  in  the  presence  of  obiltoxaximab.  The  neutralizing  capacity  of  obiltoxaximab  is 
expressed  as  the  half  maximal  effective  concentration  (EC50)  in  ng/mL  and  as  the  percent  potency 
relative to a reference standard assigned as 100%. 
Batch analysis 
Batch  release  data  from  several  batches  has  been  provided.  The  data  confirm  compliance  with  the 
proposed commercial specifications and confirm consistency of the product. The presented data indicate 
that the process is under control.  
Reference materials 
The  establishments  and  history  of  in-house  reference  standards  have  been  outlined.  To  date,  three 
obiltoxaximab reference standards have been manufactured and qualified. Data from release testing and 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 15/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
characterisation  for  the  reference  standards  are  presented  and  considered  acceptable.  Protocols  are 
provided  for  qualification  and  annual  requalification  of  primary  and  secondary  reference  standard, 
respectively. 
Container closure 
The  applicant  has  confirmed  that  the  container  closure  system  conforms  to  European  Pharmacopoeia 
3.2.2 Plastic Containers and Closures for Pharmaceutical Use (30202). The applicant further provided 
the certificate of analysis, the toxicological risk assessment and the extractable study for the container. 
Stability 
The long-term storage condition of -80°C ± 15°C is supported by real time data. Stability data for 
three engineering lots and two commercial lots were provided. These were produced at the commercial 
scale at the proposed commercial manufacturing site.  
The forced degradation investigated exhibited no changes when subjected to agitation and freeze/thaw 
conditions  but  was  affected  by  photodegradation,  deamidation,  oxidation,  thermal  stress  and  pH 
hydrolysation.  
2.2.2.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Description of the product 
The finished product is presented as a 6.0 mL concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 mg/mL 
of  obiltoxaximab  as  active  substance.  Other  ingredients  are:  histidine,  sorbitol,  polysorbate  80, 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections 
(WFI).  Obiltoxaximab  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  clear  to  opalescent,  colourless  to  pale 
yellow-pale brownish-yellow solution provided as a single-use glass vial stoppered with rubber stoppers 
and sealed with aluminium flip-off seals.  
There are no overages.  
All  excipients  comply  with  the  requirements  in  the  corresponding  Ph.  Eur.  monographs,  and 
pharmacopoeial methods are used for testing. There are no novel excipients and none of the excipients 
are of human or animal origin. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The active substance is diluted with formulation buffer to a concentration of 100 ± 10 mg/mL. The 
buffering component, L-histidine, maintains the pH in the range of 5.0-6.0. Sorbitol functions as the 
stabiliser and the Polysorbate 80 prevents aggregation. Nitrogen gas is used during the stoppering 
process.  
The changes in the finished product manufacturing process are associated with changes in the active 
substance manufacturing process. Comparability studies were performed following each change in the 
active substance manufacturing process. Each comparability study compared finished product from the 
previous manufacturing process to active substance manufactured from the new process. Although this 
approach is rather unusual (and does not reflect the differences in the finished product manufacturing 
process) it can be accepted while the differences between the finished product processes are minor. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 16/113 
 
 
  
 
 
Comparability data (release data and extended characterisation) indicate that finished product filled at 
all manufacturing sites can be considered comparable.  
The  finished  product  is  supplied  in  a  glass  vial  with  a  sterile  rubber  stopper.  The  glass  vial  and  the 
stopper, which are in product contact, meet the requirements of the Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 
respectively. In addition, an extraction study was performed. No significant extractables were observed 
in the glass vial sample. After treatment of whole stoppers in water under harsh conditions, no significant 
peaks  were  observed.  Given  the  aqueous nature of  the  finished product  formulation  the  possibility  of 
extractables leaching into the finished product is considered low.  
Infusion solutions of obiltoxaximab in the intravenous (IV) diluent 0.9% sodium chloride were found to 
be compatible with common infusion bags of two different materials of construction (polyvinyl chloride 
and  polyolefin)  for up  to  8  hours  at  both  room temperature  and  refrigerated temperatures  and  when 
administered through different administration-set types simulating the flow conditions of a 90-minute 
infusion.  
With  regard  to  elemental  impurities  a  risk  assessment  according  to  Q3D  (R1)  was  conducted.  Three 
batches of finished product were tested confirming that levels of elemental impurities are well below the 
permitted daily exposure limit provided in ICH Q3D. 
A risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in Obiltoxaximab SFL was provided. 
The evaluation of active substance and finished product included raw materials, the process, composition, 
container closure, stability and facility. No risk of nitrosamine impurities has been identified. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Batch release is performed by the Qualified Person located at PharmaKorell GmbH, Lörrach, Germany.  
The manufacturing process for the finished product consists of thawing concentrated active substance, 
mixing with formulation buffer, and aseptically filling into vials. The product is manufactured aseptically, 
and  the  solution  is  passed  through  a  bioburden  reduction  filter  (0.22  μm)  and  subsequently  filtered 
through two 0.22 μm sterile filters in series. Bioburden is tested prior to the bioburden reduction filter 
and in between the bioburden reduction and the sterilizing filters. Filter integrity testing is performed 
pre-  and  post-filtration.  No  reprocessing  procedures  are  foreseen  for  the  manufacture  of  the  finished 
product. 
In-process controls (IPCs) with adequate acceptance criteria are defined. CPPs are identified and limits 
are provided.  
The  process  validation  activities  covered  equipment  validation,  qualification  of  container  closure 
components and raw materials, IPC analytical method validation or qualification, validation of sterilizing 
filters,  media  fill  validation,  manufacturing  process  validation  and  shipping  validation.  Overall,  the 
activities are sufficiently described. All PV lots met the release acceptance criteria. Shipping validation 
studies confirm suitable packaging configuration. All acceptance criteria set forth in the pre-approved 
process validation protocol have been met.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specifications and analytical methods have been established to adequately control 
the identity, quality, purity, and potency of the finished product at release and throughout the proposed 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 17/113 
 
 
  
 
 
shelf life. Specifications were set according to the principles set forth in ICH Q6B. Compendial tests are 
included as appropriate for the dosage form and route of administration, and limits are set in accordance 
with Ph. Eur.  
Justifications  for  the  compendial  and  non-compendial  methods  included  in  the  finished  product 
specification and the corresponding acceptance criteria are provided. The limits for purity and potency 
are based on the process capability of active substance lots, due to a limited number of finished product 
lots and the nature of the product that precludes full clinical development. The difficulty to set clinically 
justified limits for this type of product and indication is acknowledged. The proposed purity and potency 
limits are acceptable since the levels as such are generally considered safe and potential immunological 
side effects are less relevant due to the single dose administration of the product. 
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions and brief method validation summary tables for the assays specific for the finished 
product  are  provided.  All  other  methods  are  either  identical  to  those  used  for  analysis  of  the  active 
substance or compendial methods.  
Batch analysis 
Batch  release  results  for  the  finished  product  are  provided  and  include  batches  derived  from  process 
validation, batches used for preclinical studies and for clinical trials. All lots met the acceptance criteria 
in  place  at  the  time  of  release.  The  batch  analysis  data  demonstrates  acceptable  batch-to-batch 
consistency and reproducibility of the manufacturing process proposed for the finished product. 
Reference materials 
Please see the active substance section. The same reference standards are used for the active substance 
and finished product.  
Stability of the product 
Finished product stability studies at the recommended storage condition of 5°C ± 3°C are ongoing for 
several  lots.  These  lots  were  filled  and  finished  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site  from  active 
substance  manufactured  at  the  commercial  active  substance  manufacturing  site  (Lonza  Portsmouth). 
The PV lots have been shown to be stable up to 72 months at the recommended storage condition of 
5°C ± 3°C (studies ongoing) and filled in the intended commercial container.  
The claimed shelf-life and storage conditions as per the SmPC of 6 years in a refrigerator (2°C–8°C) is 
supported by real time data according to ICH Q5C and therefore considered acceptable.  
According to GMP requirements one cGMP finished product lot per year (if produced) is placed on stability 
in support of commercial production. 
An in-use microbial study was performed to determine the acceptable storage time for finished product 
prepared in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in IV bags (ViaFlex). Adventitious microbial proliferation does 
not occur when the finished product is diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride IV bags for up to 16 hours when 
stored at either refrigerated or room temperature conditions. The performed studies support the stability 
claim of 8 hours at either refrigerated or at room temperature conditions as outlined in the SmPC.

Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been proposed for replacement of the current 
filling line with an optimised filling line.  
There will be no changes to the batch size, solution preparation step or sterile filtration; only the filling 
line will change. A comparison of the current and proposed fill lines is included in the PACMP. A Failure 
Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) risk assessment was conducted to assess the proposed changes to 
the validated process in order to identify the potential risks to product quality and detail a strategy on 
how these risks will be mitigated. The control strategy for the new filling process will be based on the 
IPCs and release tests for the finished product.  
As there is no overall change to the batch size, solution preparation step or sterile filtration the proposed 
data package (appropriate risk assessment, successful validation of the new filling line, batch release 
data  and  stability  data  of  the  PV  batches)  might  be  sufficient  to  support  the  implantation  of  the  new 
filling line. The overall content of the PACMP is found acceptable and consequently a type IB variation 
may  be  used 
for 
the 
introduction  of 
the  new 
filling 
line 
in  accordance  with 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010  Questions  and  answers  on  post  approval  change  management 
protocols. 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Compliance  with  the  TSE  Guideline  (EMEA/410/01  –  rev.  3)  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated. 
Obiltoxaximab is produced in a serum-free medium and no materials of animal or human origin are used 
during manufacturing. During cell line development US- and Australian-sourced foetal bovine serum was 
used in the transfection medium. 
Viral safety 
Obiltoxaximab is expressed in murine myeloma NS0 cells in the absence of serum. Other than the cells 
themselves, no material of animal origin is added during fermentation. The cell banking system has been 
extensively screened for adventitious viruses using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. The tests did 
not detect presence of any virus contaminants in the cell banks with the exception of intracellular A-type 
and extracellular C-type retrovirus-like particles as well as reverse transcriptase activity and evidence of 
infectious  retrovirus  (in  a  single  assay)  which  are  well  known  to  be  present  in  rodent  cells.  This  is 
acceptable  since  there  is  sufficient  capacity  within  the  obiltoxaximab  manufacturing  process  to 
inactivate/remove such virus particles.  
A virus-reduction study was performed in accordance with ICH Q5A Guidance on Quality of 
Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell Lines of 
Human or Animal Origin. The steps validated for virus reduction are low pH treatment, Planova 20N 
virus reduction filtration and three chromatography steps in the purification scheme. Relevant model 
viruses were used in the study. Overall, effective reduction was demonstrated for the obiltoxaximab 
manufacturing process. 
At  the  end  of  the  obiltoxaximab  fermentation  procedure,  general  testing  for  adventitious  viruses  is 
performed, as well a specific PCR test to detect minute virus of mice. 
In summary, TSE and viral safety of obiltoxaximab has been sufficiently demonstrated.

2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal studies (non-clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics [PK] and toxicity) were conducted in 
accordance with GLP. Some exceptions to GLP were noted in individual studies. However, these 
exceptions are not considered to affect the interpretation of study data or the scientific validity of the 
studies.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action 
Obiltoxaximab (ETI-204) is a chimeric mAb with human IgG1/κ constant regions and de-immunised 
murine variable regions. Obiltoxaximab specifically binds and neutralises the Bacillus anthracis PA, the 
cell-binding component of anthrax toxin.  
PA is one of three polypeptides in the tripartite B. anthracis toxin, also consisting of the lethal factor 
(LF), and edema factor (EF). PA and LF combine to produce anthrax lethal toxin (LT), while PA and EF 
combine to produce edema toxin (ET).  
The 83 kDa form of PA binds to anthrax toxin receptors (ATR) on the cell surface (either GMC-2 or 
TEM-8) and is subsequently cleaved by cell-associated proteases into a receptor-bound 63 kDa 
fragment and a soluble, inactive 20 kDa fragment. PA63 subsequently assembles with LF or EF and 
mediates translocation of these factors into the target cells. LF is the predominant cause of severe 
disease and death following inhalation spore exposure. Because of PA’s central role in toxin assembly 
and intoxication of target cells, PA neutralisation strategies may be effective in preventing the 
establishment and progression of anthrax disease. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro 
Using Biacore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) obiltoxaximab was shown to bind to B. anthracis PA 
with a KD of 0.33 nM. This is approximately 10x higher than the affinity of the parental murine mAb 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 20/113 
 
 
  
 
 
14B7 for PA. The obiltoxaximab affinity for PA lies in the range of the affinity of PA for its cellular 
receptors (0.17 to 1 nM) as described in the literature.  
The reactivity of obiltoxaximab with PA from three B. anthracis strains (Ames, Sterne, and Vollum) was 
shown by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. While this is a limited number of B. 
anthracis strains, obiltoxaximab can be expected to detect PA irrespective of clade based on literature 
data indicating limited genetic variability of B. anthracis in general (Keim et al., 1997) and of the PA 
gene in particular (Price et al. 1999). Information on the variability in the level of toxin production 
across B. anthracis strains is not available in the literature. 
The capacity of obiltoxaximab to prevent binding of PA to the cell surface Anthrax Toxin Receptors 
(ATRs) was tested by interference/displacement studies in the ELISA format. Obiltoxaximab dose-
dependently, at ≥0.5 molar excess, blocked both the binding of PA83 and PA63 binding to the soluble 
form of CMG-2, the ATR predominantly responsible for the effects of anthrax toxin. Binding to TEM-8 
ATR was also investigated but did not work in this assay format, which was assumed to be due to its 
1000-fold lower affinity than CMG-2 for PA.  
At the cellular level, obiltoxaximab and the murine parent mAb 14B7 was tested for its ability to rescue 
murine macrophages by neutralisation of anthrax LT. Both mAbs demonstrated improved survival of a 
murine macrophage cell line incubated with LT, but the EC50 of obiltoxaximab was one fourth versus 
that of the parental mAb 14B7. This finding reflects the higher affinity of obiltoxaximab for PA 
compared to the parental mAb. 
In vivo 
Two in vivo models for inhalational anthrax infection, in rabbit and non-human primate, were used for 
the non-clinical pharmacodynamic (PD) in vivo evaluation. These rabbit and non-human primate 
animal models are often cited as generating data with suggested relevance to human inhalational 
anthrax, at least from a perspective of comparing pathological lesions during the end stage of disease.  
The present studies were in general designed based on addressing survival/time to death as primary 
endpoints and with bacteraemia, PA serum levels and other parameters put as secondary readouts in 
an exploratory fashion. In the non-clinical pharmacology summary and associated parts of the 
overview, the applicant has in general focused on the PA serum levels, which in some studies appears 
to shift the study objectives. In the assessment, survival and bacteraemia data have been extracted 
from the original reports and are assessed in order to put the PA serum data in its context. 
In GLP trigger-to-treat studies, New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were challenged with spore infection 
by inhalation of ~200 LD50 equivalents, before treatment with ETI-204 or vehicle. A positive result in 
a qualitative electro-chemiluminescence PA (PA-ECL) assay or a significant increase in body 
temperature (SIBT) was used as trigger-to-treat. Positive animals were administered a single IV bolus 
of ETI-204 at 0 (0.9% NaCl), 1, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg and evaluated for up to 28 days post challenge 
(PC). Blood sampling was carried out pre-challenge (i.e., Day -7), at 24, 30, 36, and 42 hours PC prior 
to treatment (or until decision to treat) with ETI-204, and at 0.25, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours post-
treatment, and on Days 8, 12, 16, 20, and 28 PC. Rabbits that were bacteraemic prior to treatment 
and treated with ETI-204 at 1, 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg demonstrated survival rates of 17%, 33%, 69%, 
and 62%, respectively while all saline treated animals succumbed to infection (the 4, 8 or 16 mg/kg 
groups survival were significant to the control). Ninety percent (63/70) of the challenged animals were 
bacteraemic before treatment. The rest were treated based on SIBT. Resolution of bacteraemia 
occurred by 8 days PC for most rabbits that survived. There were significant relationships between ETI-
204 dose versus survival as well as quantitative bacteraemia levels at the prior to treatment (PTT) 
study time point versus survival. PA levels in controls animals increased steadily over time until death, 
whereas very few samples collected post-treatment with ETI-204 ever rose above the lower limit of 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 21/113 
 
 
  
 
 
quantification (LLOQ). At 8, 24 and 48 hours post-treatment, there were significantly more animals 
with PA levels >LLOQ in the saline control treated compared to all ETI-204 treated groups (p<0.0001). 
PK testing showed the terminal half-life (t1/2), systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) 
were similar across the dose groups, indicating these parameter values were independent of dose. The 
serum concentrations of ETI-204 declined below LLOQ in surviving animals after approximately 8 days 
post treatment (PT) which corresponded with the confirmed presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).  
In order to test for an add-on effect with antibiotics, ETI-204 (16 mg/kg single IV bolus, concurrently 
with 1st levofloxacin dose) was administrated in combination with levofloxacin (6.5 mg/kg/day QD x3) 
in a non-GLP study. Levofloxacin was administered at a suboptimal antibiotic dosing and delayed 
treatment regimen to allow for identification of possible additive or interference effects of ETI-204. The 
survival rate in both the levofloxacin and levofloxacin + ETI-204 treated groups were significantly 
greater than in the control group. However, the survival rate for the levofloxacin + ETI-204 treated 
group was not significantly different from the levofloxacin only treated group. In the control group PA 
levels rose sharply through 24 hours post-treatment, and no animals survived past that timepoint. In 
the Levofloxacin only group, PA levels were quantifiable through 24 hours following the 1st treatment, 
otherwise below LLOQ after 2nd and 3rd treatment while in the combined treatment PA levels were 
below LLOQ at all timepoints.  
In the non-human primate, cynomolgus, model challenged and monitored in a similar fashion as the 
rabbit, various doses of ETI-204 was tested with a variable outcome.  
In one study, survival rate for 4 or 8 mg/kg were 79 and 73% respectively vs. 14 % in the saline 
group; complete resolution of bacteraemia was evident at 96 hours post ETI-204 treatment. In 
contrast, resolution for the two surviving saline treated monkeys occurred by Day 14 post challenge; 
Total PA levels (including ETI-204 bound PA) declined steadily post-treatment in 4 and 8 mg/kg groups 
and were < LOD by Day 14 PC. In contrast, PA levels in saline treated group were higher through Day 
7 PC. The applicant conclude these results suggest that ETI-204 is efficacious in protecting against 
death due to anthrax when administrated IV after the onset of disease in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Moreover, ETI-binds effectively to PA in monkeys and result in a faster return to normal compared to 
saline treatment. Monkeys with PA levels <100 ng/ml prior to treatment were more likely to survive if 
treated with ETI-204 than administered saline. 
In a second study, survival rate for 4 or 16 mg/kg were 25 and 47% respectively vs. 6 % in the saline 
group. The difference in survival rates between the ETI-204-treated and the control group were not 
significant. However, when time to death in addition to survival was considered and the Bonferroni-
Holm adjustment was used, the 16 mg/kg ETI-204 group was significantly more protected compared to 
the control group (p = 0.0061). Complete resolution of bacteraemia occurred by 7 days post-treatment 
for all animals that survived to their scheduled sacrifice. A significantly greater proportion of animals 
were positive for PA-ELISA in the saline group compared to both the 4 and 16 mg/kg ETI-204 group at 
6, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-treatment and at the terminal time point. 
In a third study, there was no significant relationship between ETI-204 dose (0, 8 or 32 mg/kg) and 
survival (13, 6 and 38%). At 48 hours and 96 hours post-treatment, there were statistically significant 
differences in the proportion of animals positive for bacteraemia between the saline control group and 
the group treated with 32 mg/kg. Significantly more saline control animals had quantifiable free PA 
levels when compared to animals administered 8 or 32 mg/kg ETI-204 visible from 15 minutes PT. 
Furthermore, the intramuscular (IM) route of administration was used to investigate the protective 
efficacy of ETI-204 when administered at increasing times following exposure to B. anthracis spores. 
Trigger (PA-ECL)-positive monkeys were administered a single IM dose of ETI-204 at 16 mg/kg at 24, 
36, or 48 hours PC and evaluated for up to 28 days PC. Survival rates of 93%, 43%, and 29% were 
obtained after treatments at 24, 36- or 48-hours PC respectively, while 10% of vehicle treated animals 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 22/113 
 
 
  
 
 
survived until scheduled termination. As expected, as the time between challenge and IM treatment 
with ETI-204 increased, the survival probability decreased. For animals treated at 36 or 48 hrs PC, the 
probability of survival significantly decreased in animals with higher PTT PA-ELISA and bacteraemia 
levels. Complete resolution of bacteraemia occurred by 7 days PC for all monkeys that survived to 
scheduled termination. All terminal specimens (blood collected at euthanasia or after animal was found 
dead) were positive. At start of treatment, free-PA serum levels were as high as in the control in the 
48-h group, intermediate in the 36 h group and low in the 24 h group. 24 h post treatment and 
throughout the study, all ETI-treated groups showed a low PA level as compared to the control. The 
time of IM administration did not appear to affect ETI-204 PK profiles. These results indicate that ETI-
204 is efficacious when administered IM 24 hrs post challenge. When intervention was delayed, the 
time between exposure and intervention appears critical and inversely proportional to the chance for 
survival. 
To examine whether the anti-PA mAb obiltoxaximab would interfere with the development of a 
protective anti-PA immune response, animals surviving the challenge with B. anthracis were tested for 
the presence of endogenous anti-PA antibodies. Anti-PA antibodies were detected by ELISA methods 
that detect both obiltoxaximab and rabbit IgG due to the use of detection reagents that were not 
species-specific. Thus, these methods can detect endogenous anti-PA antibodies only when levels of 
obiltoxaximab have sufficiently cleared. Due to the long half-life of obiltoxaximab in cynomolgus 
monkeys, the development of an anti-PA immune response upon-challenge with B. anthracis under 
treatment with obiltoxaximab was assessed in rabbits only; this is acceptable.  
In the rabbit studies discussed by the applicant, treatment was administered via different routes of 
administration (IV, IM), included obiltoxaximab monotherapy or combination treatment with 
levofloxacin; treatment time ranged from 35 min prior to challenge up to 72 hrs post-challenge. One 
study also assessed the development of anti-PA antibodies upon re-challenge; i.e. rabbits surviving an 
initial B. anthracis challenge were re-challenged 9 months later.  
In general, serum samples taken prior to B. anthracis exposure were negative for anti-PA antibodies 
while animals surviving the B. anthracis challenge had detectable anti-PA antibody levels. In studies 
where obiltoxaximab was compared to levofloxacin treatment, levels of anti-PA antibodies were not 
different in the different treatment groups. Results from the re-challenge study further show that the 
anti-PA antibody response in rabbits surviving an anthrax challenge was long-lasting. Together, these 
studies demonstrate that the presence of obiltoxaximab (i.e. an anti-PA antibody) does not prevent 
development of an immune response to PA. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Because ETI-204 is a mAb with no endogenous target(s), no secondary PD studies were conducted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
ETI-204 was evaluated in a set of GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies including assessment of 
neurobehavioral effects in a study in infected monkeys and two cardiovascular (CV) studies in 
monkeys. Respiratory safety was assessed in the repeated-dose toxicity studies. 
CNS effects were studied in a cynomolgus trigger-to-treat inhalation anthrax study (also assessed in 
the primary PD section). The animals were administered a single IV bolus of ETI-204 at 0 (0.9% NaCl), 
4 or 16 mg/kg. Neurobehavioral examinations were performed on all monkeys pre-test (Day -6) and 
on all surviving monkeys on Days 28 (interim sacrifice) and 56 PC (terminal sacrifice). A total of 19/48 
underwent the PC neurological assessment (at start n=8/sex /group). There were no treatment-related 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 23/113 
 
 
  
 
 
effects of ETI-204 on any of the neurological assessment parameters. Out of 19 performed neurological 
assessments PC, 12 were normal for all evaluated parameters. In 6 animals, the only reported finding 
was a decreased range of motion in thoracic limbs, which was considered an incidental finding with a 
multi-factorial aetiology in captive non-human primates. 
Cardiovascular effects were studied in cynomolgus monkeys (n=12/sex). ETI-204 was administered by 
a single IV slow bolus injection (3-5 min) at 5 mg/kg or a single IM injection at 5 or 10 mg/kg. A 
vehicle control group was not included in the study design. Peripheral blood pressure and 
electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded for anesthetised monkeys pre-test (Day -1) and 2, 4, and 24 
hours post-treatment. There were no biologically significant treatment-related effects on blood 
pressure or ECG parameters (PR interval, QT interval, QRS duration, and heart rate) after IV or IM 
dosing of ETI-204. Biologically significant prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) was not observed at any 
dose or interval. Transient elevations in both systolic and diastolic pressure values were observed at 2 
and 4 hours post-treatment on Day 1 in all groups administered ETI-204 when compared to pre-test 
values. There were no differences noted between dosing routes, and no differences between the 
administered IM doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. At 24 hours post-treatment, blood pressure values returned 
to baseline in all groups. Several animals had slightly shorter RR intervals than 0.27 seconds (0.25, 
0.26); however, normal RR intervals have not been established.  
In order to verify that the observed CV changes in the anesthetised animal study were due to study 
procedures and not ETI-204, cardiovascular safety was assessed in conscious, telemetered monkeys 
that had received 2 IV doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg 2 days apart. There were no test article-related effects 
on heart rate, body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, MAP, ECG waveform, or 
activity. No prolongations of QT or QTc, atrioventricular conduction defects, or premature atrial or 
ventricular complexes were observed in any animal on any study day. Thus, the observations of 
shorter RR intervals were considered to be of no biological significance.  
Although formal respiratory safety studies were not conducted, detailed daily clinical observations 
including respiratory monitoring were recorded in the conducted non-clinical toxicology studies with 
ETI-204. There were no treatment-related clinical observations indicative of respiratory effects after 
repeat dosing of ETI-204 in tested species (including rat, rabbit and monkey). 
In summary, no safety pharmacology concerns were identified. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical Methods 
•  Quantification of ETI-204 
Serum separator tubes (SST) were used for the collection of blood samples for bioanalysis and 
immunogenicity analysis but not for the preparation of standards and QCs of the respective methods.  
Rat 
The assay for quantification of ETI-204 in rat serum is a generic assay. Interferences have been noted 
with PA63 and PA83. 
Rabbit & monkey 
The concentrations of free ETI-204 were determined in serum or dose formulations using multiple 
versions of a sandwich immunoassay that captured ETI-204 with PA83 or PA63 and detected it either 
using goat antihuman IgG conjugated to Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) or ruthenylated protein A/G 
(detecting also endogenous anti-PA antibodies).  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 24/113 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Anti-drug antibody analysis 
ADA analysis follows a tiered approach with a screening assay, confirmation assay and titration. 
Samples are incubated with both biotinylated-ETI-204 and ruthenylated-ETI-204, allowing any anti-
ETI-204 antibodies present in the sample to bind both labelled forms of the drug in a bridging complex. 
The complex is then captured on streptavidin coated MSD microtitre plates via the biotinylated portion 
of the complex and readout occurs via ECL. The confirmatory assay includes an additional step, where 
free ETI-204 is added and disrupts the complex, inhibiting binding to the plate resulting in a reduced 
signal. No neutralizing antibody assay was used in preclinical studies. 
•  Quantification of PA 
Several assays were developed to quantify free PA63 and/or PA83 in serum of rabbits and monkeys. 
Early methods had issues with specificity. The later assays using ETI-204 as the solid-phase 
immobilised capture antibody, followed by either goat anti-PA antisera, and horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP)-conjugated anti-gamma chain secondary antibody or an HRP-conjugated anti-PA antibody for 
detection. The assays were able to quantify either PA83 or PA63, but not PA20 and were validated for 
use in rabbit and monkey serum, respectively. The assays do not tolerate ETI-204 and can only be 
used for samples before ETI-204 treatment. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetics (healthy animals) 
The PK of obiltoxaximab were evaluated in single-dose PK studies in rabbits and cynomolgus after IV 
or IM administration. Toxicokinetics of obiltoxaximab following repeated IV administrations were 
determined in rats and cynomolgus; as well as in pregnant rabbits as part of the embryofoetal 
development studies (see below). Thus, the studies reflect the PK of obiltoxaximab when administered 
according to the proposed clinical route of administration. 
After IV administration, ETI-204 concentrations generally declined in a bi- or multi-exponential manner 
in rabbit and monkey serum, and in rabbit plasma. After IV or IM administration, the terminal t1/2 
ranged from 2.59 to 5.75 days (IV) and 1.4 to 8.14 days (IM) in rabbits, and 9.20 to 13.9 days (IV) 
and 6.57 to 12.0 days (IM) in monkeys. There were no gender-related differences in PK noted in any 
species, and increasing doses produced approximately dose-proportional increases in systemic 
exposure in all species tested. After a single IM administration, the time to the maximum concentration 
(Tmax) ranged from 1.3 to 3.61 days in rabbits and 0.917 to 2 days in monkeys. Absolute bioavailability 
in rabbits after a single IM administration of ETI-204 was approximately 100% after a 10 mg/kg dose. 
In a single monkey study, the absolute bioavailability after a single IM dose of ETI-204 at 10 mg/kg 
was 73%. The volume of distribution of ETI-204 after IV administration extended past the total plasma 
volume in rats, rabbits, and monkeys, suggesting limited distribution outside of the vascular space. CL 
of ETI-204 from plasma was limited, representing <1.0% of hepatic and renal plasma flows in rats, 
rabbits, and monkeys. 
Immunogenicity 
The potential for development of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) to ETI-204 was investigated in 
rabbits and monkeys. In rabbits, 7 total serum samples across 4 studies were confirmed positive for 
antibodies to ETI-204 with a titre range of 1:5 to 1:125, which had no effect on ETI-204 concentration 
or PK parameters. In monkeys, 4/6 serum samples were confirmed positive in 1 study (AP116) where 
only samples from animals in the 10 mg/kg IM dosing group were analysed; however, a second IM 
study (AP118) in monkeys at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg where all animals administered ETI-204 were 
evaluated 5 total confirmed positive samples were identified. The titre range in monkeys across both 
studies was 1:40 to 1:2560. The development of anti-ETI-204 antibodies may have resulted in 
decreased exposure in animals at later timepoints in the 10 mg/kg dosing group in study AP116; 
however, no concurrent decrease in ETI-204 exposure was noted in animals positive for antibodies to 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 25/113 
 
 
  
 
 
ETI-204 in study AP118, suggesting that the antibodies did not enhance the elimination of ETI-204. 
However, the number of ADA positive animals and the levels of antibody titre may have been 
underestimated due to shortcomings in the analysis method. 
Distribution, metabolism and excretion 
It has been amply demonstrated that the disposition of mAbs generally involves distribution beyond 
the vascular space with potential uptake into tissues, and catabolism by proteases to small peptides 
and amino acids which are subsequently incorporated into the endogenous pool or excreted. Therefore, 
the lack of formal distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies is endorsed. 
No specific non-clinical PK drug interaction studies were conducted. This is acceptable, since 
obiltoxaximab as a mAb is not metabolised via CYP450 enzymes. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of obiltoxaximab was assessed in short-term studies in healthy rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. These species were selected based on results from tissue cross-reactivity studies, which is 
considered acceptable, given that obiltoxaximab does not recognise an endogenous target. The 
reproductive and developmental toxicity was assessed in rabbits. In addition, local tolerance at the IM 
injection site was assessed as part of the efficacy studies in anthrax-challenged rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys. Neuropathology was evaluated primarily in anthrax-challenged rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys. Taken together, the obiltoxaximab non-clinical safety programme is considered 
adequate for a mAb, targeting a foreign antigen. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicology of ETI-204 has been investigated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys for 
up to 14 and 17 days, respectively, to support clinical administration of a single dose of ETI-204 via IV 
infusion or IM injection. 
In the 7-day rat study the only observations were minimal changes in several clinical pathology 
parameters attributable to individual animal variability and of no toxicologic relevance.  
The 14-day pilot repeat-dose toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats was conducted to aid in dose 
selection for the pivotal 14-day repeat-dose study, and also to identify the MTD of ETI-204 
administered to healthy (i.e., unexposed to anthrax spores) rats. No adverse effects were observed at 
all at doses up to 100 mg/kg/dose, and consequently an MTD was not identified. With this result it is 
questioned why the applicant selected a high dose of only 30 mg/kg/dose in the definitive 14-day 
repeat-dose study, where again no effects at all were identified.  
In the definitive repeat-dose IV toxicology study in rats, there were no gender-related differences in TK 
parameters, and increases in systemic exposure were approximately dose-proportional. The TK 
parameters of obiltoxaximab pilot batch were compared to obiltoxaximab commercial batch at the high 
dose of 30 mg/kg/dose. The only identifiable TK difference in test article from the two batches was a 
higher maximum concentration (Cmax) in the material from the pilot batch compared to the material 
from the commercial batch in both males (1000 versus 667 μg/mL) and females (1140 versus 697 
μg/mL), respectively. This was attributed to the high variability in mean Cmax for the commercial batch 
at that timepoint (%CV = 62; 0.25 hours postdose). Mean serum concentrations of pilot and 
commercial obiltoxaximab batches at 4 hours following the first dose were comparable (672 versus 
793 μg/mL, respectively). The mean t1/2 was similar between dose groups and ranged from 2.46 to 
3.57 days. The mean Tmax was 15 minutes, except in females at 30 mg/kg/dose (commercial batch), 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 26/113 
 
 
  
 
 
where the Tmax was 4 hours. Mean Vz (volume of distribution in the terminal phase) values did not vary 
with dose and ranged from 35.1 to 76.5 mL/kg, which is larger than the total plasma volume in rats, 
indicating that ETI-204 may have distributed out of the vascular space. Additionally, mean CL values 
did not vary with dose and ranged from 12.4 to 15.4 mL/day/kg, which represents <0.1% of hepatic 
and renal plasma flows in rats. 
The toxicity of ETI-204 was also investigated in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to and including 30 
mg/kg/dose administered via two 60-minute IV infusions with 8 days between doses. Also, in this 
study toxicity/adverse effects were not observed at the high dose of 30 mg/kg/dose. It was concluded 
that IV infusion of obiltoxaximab at doses up to and including 30 mg/kg did not cause any toxicological 
effects and was not associated with any adverse changes in cardiovascular function in young adult 
male or female cynomolgus monkeys. 
Serum concentrations of obiltoxaximab in the cynomolgus following IV administration generally 
declined with time in a bi-exponential or multi-exponential manner and measurable concentrations 
persisted through the last sampling timepoint. Observed increases in systemic exposure were 
approximately dose-proportional after the first and second dose, and values generally increased after 
the second dose. Gender-related differences in exposure were limited to 30 mg/kg/dose after the first 
dose, where male values were approximately 40% higher than females. The t1/2 ranged from 
approximately 6 to 9 days, and mean values were somewhat longer after the first dose. Observed Vz 
ranged from 58.2 to 76.9 mL/kg after the first dose, which is greater than the total plasma volume in 
monkeys, indicating that obiltoxaximab may have distributed slightly beyond the vascular space. CL 
was very low, ranging from 5.088 to 8.808 mL/day/kg, which represents approximately 0.01 to 0.02% 
of monkey hepatic plasma flow and 0.02 to 0.04% of monkey renal plasma flow. 
The applicant concludes that animal exposures to obiltoxaximab at the NOAEL or NOEL in the repeat-
dose toxicity studies and embryofoetal development toxicity studies provide adequate safety margins 
relative to the exposure to a 16 mg/kg dose in humans. It is not agreed that exposure margins were 
achieved since the exposure at the high dose of 30 mg/kg in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
the rat and in the monkey is approximately the same as the exposure in humans at the clinical dose 
based on comparison of area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC). In the embryofoetal 
developmental study in the rabbit the exposure in the high dose was 2x clinical exposure.  
It is however recognised that obiltoxaximab is a mAb directed at a component of the anthrax toxin and 
without an endogenous target in either humans or laboratory animals. Therefore, toxicity related to 
exaggerated pharmacology is not expected. As pointed out in the ICH S6 addendum, one short-term 
study in one species can be considered; no additional toxicity studies, including reproductive toxicity, 
studies are appropriate. As expected, there were no toxicity findings in any of the conducted studies 
and the lack of an exposure margin to the highest recommended clinical exposure is accepted. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with ETI-204. This is in accordance 
with ICH S6 guidance based on the nature of the substance being a mAb and no direct or indirect DNA 
interactions are anticipated. In addition, carcinogenicity studies are not required in support of a single-
dose clinical regimen. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
ETI-204 was evaluated for embryofoetal development in time-mated NZW rabbits administered vehicle 
or ETI-204 at 16 or 32 mg/kg/dose (30/group) via slow IV bolus on GD 6, 10, 13, and 17. The 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 27/113 
 
 
  
 
 
frequency of dosing was based on an approximate t1/2 of 4 days in rabbits following IV administration. 
No maternal toxicity or embryofoetal toxicity was observed at any dose level tested. The exposure 
margin to the human clinical exposure (AUC) in the high dose is 2-fold. Placental transfer was not 
evaluated. 
Toxicity of obiltoxaximab has not been assessed in juvenile animals. This is acceptable and in line with 
the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (P/0018/2018), as there are no concerns with regard to 
paediatric patients which would warrant a juvenile toxicity study. 
Local Tolerance  
Several nonclinical studies evaluated local tolerance at the injection site in rabbits and monkeys after 
IM injections. There were no test article-related histopathological findings observed at the injection site 
neither in healthy rabbits nor in inhalation anthrax challenged rabbits following IM administration. In 
anthrax infected cynomolgus monkeys, minimal chronic active inflammatory lesions were noted at the 
injection site and were occasionally associated with myofiber necrosis. Microscopic lesions following IM 
administration were limited to minimal to mild chronic inflammation confined to the dermis, 
subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle, with occasional chronic active inflammation and/or bacteria seen 
at the injection site of moribund or found dead animals. No specific studies investigating local tolerance 
following IV infusion was presented. The local tolerance following IV infusion was studied in the clinic. 
Other toxicity studies 
Neuropathology 
Neuropathological examination of brain tissues was included in several efficacy studies in anthrax-
challenged rabbits and cynomolgus because raxibacumab, another anti-anthrax toxin mAb, was 
associated with a greater incidence and/or severity of CNS lesions in anthrax animal models. As 
control, neuropathology was also evaluated in one toxicity study in non-challenged rabbits. 
Evaluation of neuropathology after repeated obiltoxaximab IV bolus administrations (32 mg/kg/dose x 
4) in uninfected pregnant rabbits revealed no treatment-related microscopic brain lesions indicating 
that obiltoxaximab per se does not mediate neuropathology. Also, evaluation of neuropathology in 
anthrax-exposed rabbits and monkeys revealed no treatment-related microscopic brain lesions in 
animals surviving a single administration of obiltoxaximab at doses up to 16 mg/kg in rabbits (IV and 
IM bolus) and up to 32 mg/kg in monkeys (IV bolus).  
In those animals that succumbed to the infection, an inflammatory response was seen in meninges and 
brain, including haemorrhage, vasculitis and tissue necrosis. The inflammatory response was more 
frequent and/or more severe in obiltoxaximab-treated animals than in non-survivors administered 
placebo. This effect was more pronounced in monkeys but was also present in rabbits. The applicant 
was asked to comment on the relation of the incidence and/or severity of the neuropathological 
findings in obiltoxaximab-treatment takin into consideration the underlying disease and the moment of 
death or euthanasia of the animal. In response, the applicant indicated that link of incidence/severity 
of CNS lesions with time to death/euthanasia was not established for individual animals. However, all 
animals succumbed to the infection within 10 days of challenge, while survivors lived to the scheduled 
necropsies (day 28 or 56 post-challenge). The key to the development of biologically significant CNS 
lesions was found to be the presence of extravascular bacteria at the time of death/moribund sacrifice 
indicating bacterial dissemination to the CNS. Thus, the histopathological changes in the CNS of 
anthrax-challenged non-survivors were in general consistent with haemorrhagic meningoencephalitis. 
Exacerbated inflammation observed in the meninges of obiltoxaximab-treated non-survivors 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 28/113 
 
 
  
 
 
(compared to untreated non-survivors) may have resulted from more effective immune activation due 
to systemic neutralisation of toxin. This argumentation is in line with that in found literature for other 
anti-PA antibodies and accepted. 
Tissue cross-reactivity 
Several tissue cross-reactivity studies with obiltoxaximab were performed with obiltoxaximab in human 
tissue as well as rat and cynomolgus tissues. In all species tested, obiltoxaximab stained vascular 
smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells in several tissues. In general, the staining observed was 
cytoplasmic granules and/or filaments. Cytoplasmic targets are not accessible to a mAb in vivo. This is 
confirmed by results from an ex vivo analysis of tissues from obiltoxaximab-treated rats. There was no 
membrane or intracellular staining in any organ or tissue; but intravascular protein staining was 
observed, in all evaluated organs, attributed to obiltoxaximab present in serum. Given the intracellular 
nature of the immunohistochemistry staining and the lack of such staining in tissues from rats treated 
with obiltoxaximab, the TCR results are not considered toxicologically relevant. 
In conclusion, obiltoxaximab has been evaluated in an ICH-compliant (S6, M3) nonclinical development 
toxicology program, including repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat and the cynomolgus monkey, 
embryofoetal toxicity in the rabbit, and local tolerance at the injection site. As expected for a mAb 
without endogenous targets no specific toxicity of concern was observed in healthy animals and no 
further toxicity studies are required, even though exposure margins were not achieved. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Obiltoxaximab is a mAb consisting of natural amino acids and is therefore not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
To further justify the absence of ERA studies, the predicted environmental concentration in surface 
water was calculated based on the amount of obiltoxaximab likely to be used for the treatment of 
inhalation anthrax. This calculation resulted in a PECsw of 0.00064 µg/L, i.e. a value that is 
significantly <0.01 μg/L, the trigger value for conducting a Phase II assessment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The applicant has presented non-clinical in vitro data to characterise the binding and in vitro function 
of obiltoxaximab. These data consist of a basic characterisation of binding affinity, competitive 
inhibition of PA binding to its receptor, and neutralisation of the toxin cytotoxicity in a cell-based assay.  
In vivo activity of obiltoxaximab was assessed in animal models of disease, anthrax-challenged rabbits 
and cynomolgus monkeys. An extensive set of studies was performed, which demonstrate the intended 
mode of action, i.e. rapid and long-lasting neutralisation of the toxin component PA in anthrax 
challenged animals. In addition, it was demonstrated, that treatment with an anti-PA mAb does not 
prevent the development of an endogenous immune response against PA in the anthrax-challenged 
animals. Due to limitations in the assay that detects endogenous PA, this analysis could not be 
performed in cynomolgus. This can be accepted. 
The combined antibiotic and ETI-204 study in the rabbit did not demonstrate an ETI-204 add-on effect. 
However, since the levofloxacin treatment was effective when administrated alone it was difficult to 
show an additive effect. The parallel effects on the bacteraemia, as shown in this study, do not support 
an additive effect in this model. The importance of the slightly more reduced PA levels after the 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 29/113 
 
 
  
 
 
combined treatment, remains unclear since it was not reflected in parallel effects on bacteraemia or 
survival in this study.  
In conclusion of the PD studies, cynomolgus as well as the rabbit model appears suitable for testing of 
ETI-204 therapeutic potential on survival if treatment is accomplished before bacteraemia becomes too 
high, which in turn depends on degree of initial infection and time from challenge. The rabbit model 
and the current experimental design did not allow an investigation on whether an add-on effect to 
levofloxacin exists. 
Because ETI-204 is a mAb with no endogenous target(s), it is acceptable that no secondary PD studies 
were conducted. 
To summarise the safety pharmacology profile, ETI-204 appears as expected from a mAb with no 
endogenous target. However, the tested doses did not provide any clear margins to the clinical 
exposure.  
Pharmacokinetics 
•  Quantification of ETI-204 
A general issue had been raised regarding the use of serum separator tubes (SST) for the collection of 
blood samples for bioanalysis and immunogenicity analysis but not for the preparation of standards 
and QCs of the respective methods, as this may lead to a systematic error. To address this issue, the 
applicant performed an in vitro experiment investigating the recovery of ETI-204 spiked into human 
blood and processed as per the conventional method, or in SST tubes filled at volumes corresponding 
to what was used in clinical or non-clinical studies. Results for ETI-204 recovery were consistent 
between clotting procedures, blood volume and the two tested ETI-204 concentrations, indicating that 
there is no recovery issue.  
Rat 
The interferences with PA63 and PA83 have no consequences since no studies in infected rats were 
conducted. The method is otherwise adequately validated, including ISR and parallelism. 
Rabbit & Monkey 
Some of the methods for quantification of free ETI-204 were only qualified, while others were validated 
for the matrix of the species, they were intended for but had some outstanding issues. These were 
resolved with response to the D120 LoQ.  
Protein A/G binds IgGs in a non-species-specific manner, thus not distinguishing between ETI-204 and 
endogenous anti-PA antibodies, thus caution must be exerted when using data from studies AR010, 
AR014, AR0315, EFT001 pilot and EFT001 (method TLIAM-0204 & VR TNJR11-010). For studies in 
healthy animals, results may be considered reliable. 
Only addendum 1 of the validation report TNRJ-12-093 was provided, without the initial report. The 
missing report was provided and confirmed the previous conclusion on the method. 
The applicant was asked to justify the lack of parallelism data in rabbit and monkey and to discuss the 
consequences and implications of the lack of such data. The applicant was also asked to complete the 
validation package by providing parallelism data in all species the method was used in and in both 
healthy and infected animals, provided samples are still available. The applicant's opinion, that 
parallelism is not an issue for large molecules is not agreed with. However, since rabbit and monkey 
samples are no longer available to perform the parallelism investigations, and following 3Rs principles, 
the lack of parallelism data in rabbit and monkey may be accepted, if all other bioanalysis issues are 
deemed resolved.

In GCL-250, PA83 was used for capture, whereas PA63 was used in all previous assays. The applicant 
was asked to discuss the impact of the change of capture reagent on the assay results and their use. 
The applicant provided data showing that PA63 and PA83 are not directly interchangeable. 
Nevertheless, there is no direct impact on the PK modelling, since only rabbit data was generated 
using PA63 and data from the two non-clinical species were asked to be separated.  
•  Anti-drug antibody analysis 
Both the rabbit and the monkey ADA assay were validated but tolerate only low concentrations of ETI-
204, leading to a risk of false negative results. However, since obiltoxaximab is intended for single 
dosing only, these issues will not be pursued.  
•  Quantification of PA 
Early generations of the PA assay were not specific, thus their results should be disregarded (studies 
NIAID 1030, NIAID 1045, AP 201, NIAID 1056, and NIAID 2456). The later PA assay only has a limited 
utility given the significant interference by ETI-204. Therefore, only results prior to treatment with ETI-
204 can be considered reliable. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity of obiltoxaximab was assessed in healthy rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Selection of 
these species for the toxicity studies was adequately justified and accepted. The overall toxicity 
programme consists of short-term repeated-dose toxicity studies in these 2 species, embryofoetal 
development studies in rabbits, evaluation of local tolerance and tissue cross-reactivity. As such the 
programme is in line with recommendations of ICH S6(R1) for a mAb that targets a foreign antigen 
and is considered adequate.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that from a non-clinical point of view, no issues remain which would preclude 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Since controlled clinical trials in humans with anthrax are neither ethical nor feasible, clinical 
pharmacology of obiltoxaximab was evaluated in clinical studies with healthy human adults, as well as 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 32/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
in two well-characterised animal models of inhalational anthrax (NZW rabbits and cynomolgus 
monkeys), and in healthy Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 rats. 
Obiltoxaximab is to be administered as a single IV 16 mg/kg infusion over 90 minutes. 
Human PK data was collected from 7 clinical trials (AH101, AH102, AH105, AH104, AH110, AH109, and 
AH106) including also IM mode of administration. Obiltoxaximab was evaluated at different IV dose 
strength ranging from 19 mg to 16 mg/kg, single and multiple dose (two doses), and with and without 
concomitant treatment (ciprofloxacin, diphenhydramine).  
PK from the individual studies is summarised in Table 2; Table 3 compares healthy human PK 
parameters to those of the efficacy models, in their healthy and infected versions.

Methods 
•  Quantification of ETI-204 
Serum separator tubes (SST) were used for the collection of blood samples for bioanalysis and 
immunogenicity analysis but not for the preparation of standards and QCs of the respective methods. 
A qualified method was used to analyse samples from study AH101 (first in man). 
All other clinical studies were analysed using method GCL-160. The concentrations of free ETI-204 
were determined in human serum using a sandwich immunoassay that captured ETI-204 with PA83 
and detected it using a monkey adsorbed sheep anti-human IgG HRP conjugate. The method had 
several issues; however, based on additional data provided, the method can be considered sufficiently 
validated.  
•  Anti-drug antibody analysis 
Samples for ADA analysis were also collected in SST tubes.  
ADA analysis follows a tiered approach with a screening assay, confirmation assay and titration. After a 
1:10 MRD, and acid dissociation, followed by neutralisation, ADAs are captured with biotinylated ETI-
204. The biotinylated ETI-204/ADA complex is subsequently immobilised on streptavidin coated plates. 
Following a wash and re-acidification, the ADA solution is transferred to an MSD plate and 
subsequently neutralised and incubated with ruthenylated ETI-204 for ECL detection.  
The assay was validated in two steps using either rabbit anti-ETI-204 antiserum or later affinity 
purified rabbit anti-ETI-204 IgG as the positive control. ETI-204 is tolerated up to 200 µg/mL. 
The confirmatory assay includes an additional step, where free ETI-204 is added and disrupts the 
complex, inhibiting binding to the plate, thus resulting in a reduced signal.  
An assay for neutralizing antibodies was developed but was only used in study AH105 due to issues of 
interference with ETI-204. 
•  Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The objectives of the Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis Modelling of ETI-204 in Healthy and 
Anthrax-Infected Subjects were: 
•  To characterise ETI-204 population PK in healthy and infected NZW rabbits. 
•  To characterise ETI-204 population PK in healthy and infected cynomolgus monkeys. 
•  To characterise ETI-204 population PK in healthy humans. 
•  Bridge infected cynomolgus monkey PK model to humans using the healthy human model for 
the prediction of ETI-204 exposures in humans infected with inhalational anthrax. 
•  Perform population PK simulations using the bridged human model to derive ETI-204 human 
exposures for the proposed preclinical dose. 
Population analyses were conducted using the nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) software. 
EMA/524933/2020

Data 
There were ten studies used for population PK modelling consisting of one in healthy rabbits (AR010), 
one in anthrax infected rabbits (AR033), one in healthy cynomolgus monkeys (AP116), four in infected 
cynomolgus monkeys (AP201, AP202, AP203, AP204) and three in healthy humans (AH102, AH104, 
AH105). As the model in healthy and infected rabbits (AR010 and AR033) is not used for prediction of 
exposure in infected humans or dose selection, the focus in this report is on the Cynomolgus Monkey 
and Healthy Human models.  
After reducing the population PK datasets, 96 NZW rabbits with 791 observation data records (ETI-204 
serum concentrations) remained for the combined healthy and infected rabbit data set. For the 
cynomolgus monkey PK dataset, 150 monkeys with 929 observations remained. For the human 
population PK data set, 303 subjects contributed 2830 observations. Body weight was the only 
covariate considered for preclinical studies. For human studies, bodyweight, age and race (white vs. 
non-white) were used for covariate modelling. The number of excluded samples from each study was 
not presented. 
Covariate modelling 
The primary covariates of interest had been predefined for this analysis in the Modelling and 
Simulation Plan. They included age, body weight, and race (white vs. non-white) as predictors of 
variability in ETI-204 PK. A covariate modelling approach emphasizing parameter estimation rather 
than stepwise hypothesis testing was implemented for this population PK analysis. 
Model for Healthy and Infected Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The final monkey structural model consisted of a two-compartment model parameterised in terms of 
CL, Vc, Vp and Q. Absorption kinetics following IM administration were described by ka and F1. TMDD 
in infected cynomolgus monkeys was approximated via parallel nonlinear elimination for infected 
animals only, parameterised in terms of Vmax and Km. Volume and clearance terms were 
allometrically scaled (fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 for CL and Q, and 1 for Vc and Vp), normalised 
to a reference weight of 2.88 kg. 
The population model to describe ETI-204 PK in healthy and infected cynomolgus monkeys is shown 
below: 
Parameter estimates from the final model are presented in Table 4. Shrinkage estimates were 26%, 
14%, 26%, and 49% for CL, Vc, Vp, and Vmax respectively.

Results from the VPC for the healthy and infected cynomolgus monkeys demonstrate good agreement 
between simulated and observed ETI-204 concentrations (Figure 1), although the median prediction 
for 10 mg/kg dose regimens somewhat under-predicts the central tendency of the observed data.

Model for Healthy Subjects 
The initial human population PK structural model consisted of a two-compartment model with first-
order elimination, parameterised in terms of CL, Vc, Vp and Q. No absorption model was necessary, 
since all subjects received IV ETI-204 administration. A nonlinear clearance component was not 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 36/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
included, since there was no need to account for target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) in 
uninfected humans. Inter-subject random effects were included for all structural model parameters. 
Allometric exponents on clearances and volumes of distributions were estimated. 
Once the population PK model was developed for healthy humans, it was necessary to bridge the 
cynomolgus monkey model to humans to predict likely exposures in healthy and infected humans. 
Population PK simulations for healthy and projected infected paediatric subjects 
A bridged human population PK model that approximates TMDD for infected subjects was used to 
simulate healthy infected human exposures in adult and paediatric subjects. ETI-204 is eliminated by 
non-specific proteolysis, and a minimal effect of maturation on ETI-204 CL is expected. Therefore, no 
maturation effect was included in the simulation model. Although paediatric simulations would typically 
be performed using an adult population PK model that is allometrically scaled, simulations for this 
study were performed using the estimated adult weight effect exponents. Simulations were performed 
for 500 typical human subjects (weight = 75 kg) administered 16 mg/kg ETI-204 for both healthy and 
infected populations. Although 70 kg was the reference value for human PK modelling, a weight of 75 
kg was chosen for the simulations since this was closer to the median human weight for all studies. 
These simulation results were compared to those performed for infected monkeys (3 kg) administered 
16 mg/kg. 
Absorption  
Since ETI-204 is given IV, bioavailability is 100% by definition. Since ETI-204 is given IV, no food 
effect is expected. 
During the ETI-204 nonclinical and clinical development program, changes to the manufacturing 
process for ETI-204 bulk drug substance (BDS) and drug product (DP) were introduced to prepare for 
large-scale production.  
With respect to human studies, AH104, AH109, AH110, and AH106 were conducted with the 
commercial formulation of ETI-204, while AH101, AH102, and AH105 were conducted with 
investigational material. 
No comparative PK study has been designed to demonstrate equivalence between the different 
formulations with regard to key PK parameters, however comparison within and across studies 
revealed overall comparability: 
TOX001: 
Data from Study TOX001 indicate that overall, ETI-204 exposures (commercial formulation) over the 
first three days post-dose were lower (19%) compared to the pilot formulation, which might be 
attributed to imprecise measurement of the first sampling points after IV bolus injection.  
AP202: 
Similarly, data from cynomolgus monkey following 16 mg/kg IV SD in different groups within study 
AP202 indicate comparative exposure following the pilot or commercial formulation in this species.  
Comparison of 16 mg/kg IV SD (AH 105, AH104) in human (pilot vs. commercial formulations) and 
comparison of two fix doses, 114 mg (~ 1.55 mg/kg) and 120 mg (~1.49 mg/kg) pilot formulation, did 
not reveal any major differences in PK that could be attributed to the different formulations. 
PK data following the two most recent formulations (pilot and commercial) have been included in 
population PK analyses of human and animal data but has not been tested as a covariate

No protein binding studies were conducted. 
In humans, mean Vd (Vz) values ranged across studies from 5.08 to 8.75 L, and mean Vss values 
ranged from 5.68 to 7.20 L. Overall mean (± SD) Vz and Vss values were 7.0 (± 1.2) and 6.5 (± 0.61) 
L, respectively, across studies (Table 2). 
Elimination 
No metabolism and excretion studies have been conducted with ETI-204, since degradation by 
proteolysis is expected. 
Following single IV administration of ETI-204 16 mg/kg in healthy subjects, the mean Cmax and area 
under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC(0-inf)] were 400 ± 91.2 mcg/mL and 
5170 ± 1360 mcg·day/mL, respectively.  
Mean ETI-204 t1/2 values ranged from approximately 15 to 23 days at doses of approximately 0.75 
mg/kg to 32 mg/kg (Table 2).  
Mean CL values ranged across studies from 0.225 to 0.313 L/d at doses of approximately 0.75 mg/kg 
to 32 mg/kg, with an overall mean (± SD) in this dose range of 0.268 (± 0.024) L/d across studies 
(Table 2).  
Affinity of ETI-204 to FcRn has not been evaluated. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK of ETI-204 is linear over the dose range of 1.49 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg following single IV 
administration in healthy subjects (excluding study AH101 that was measured using a non-validated 
method). Mean Cmax and AUC(0-inf) at 16 mg/kg values ranged from 330 to 402 µg/mL and 4400 to 
5170 µg∙d/mL, respectively.  
Exposure in healthy human subjects following single dose IV infusion over 90 minutes increased with 
dose; however dose-proportionality could not be proven by statistical analyses in most of the human 
dose-ranging PK studies (AH102, AH105, AH106). 
The characterisation of PK following 16 mg/kg IV (SD infusion over 90 minutes) was consistent across 
the studies (AH105, AH104, AH109, AH110).  
The ETI-204 AUC(0-inf) following two 16 mg/kg doses 2 weeks apart was approximately twice that after 
a single 16 mg/kg dose on day 1 or day 120 (study AH109). No significant differences in mean 
estimates of Cmax, AUC(0-inf), CL, or half-life of ETI-204 between the 2 doses administered ≥4 months 
apart was observed (see Table 2). 
The incidence of ADA occurrence in humans was low. Approximately 3% (14/470) of subjects were 
positive for treatment-emergent ADA after a single IV dose. A total of 4/65 human subjects were 
positive for treatment-emergent ADA in those who received two IV ETI-204 doses. Titres ranged from 
1:20 to 1:320 and from 1:20 to 1:80 after single and repeat doses, respectively. After IV 
administration, the presence of ADA had no discernible effect on ETI-204 PK. There were no adverse 
events (AEs) coincident with the development of ADA in human subjects. 
No accumulation of ETI-204 was seen after multiple dose administration. ETI-204 is intended for single 
dose administration only, thus time-dependency has a low relevance.

Intra – and intervariability 
Inter-individual variability (CV%) in CL/F, Vc and Vp was estimated to be 25.4%, 19.8% and 27.8% 
respectively. As ETI-204 is going to be administered as a single dose, intra-individual variability was 
not reported. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
•  Pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects 
The human population PK data set was comprised of 303 subjects with 2830 observation records. 
Mean (range) body weights were 78.8 (50.0–96.7) kg for study AH102, 79.2 (48.4–149.5) kg for study 
AH104 and 75.2 (50.4–102.4) kg for study AH105. Mean (range) ages were 33.8 (19.0–51.0), 42.6 
(18.0–79.0), and 30.1 (18.0–58.0) years for AH102, AH104, and AH105, respectively. There were 83 
non-white subjects included in the data set.  
The final human structural model consisted of a two-compartment model parameterised in terms of CL, 
Vc, Vp and Q. Allometric exponents for volume and clearance terms were estimated instead of fixing to 
theoretical values. Inter-subject random effects were included for CL, Vc, and Vp, with a full block 
covariance matrix for all random effects. Shrinkage estimates were 2%, 5%, and 15% for CL, Vc, and 
Vp respectively. Residual error was described by a proportional error model.

•  Population PK Simulations of infected human exposures and Extrapolated Human 
Dose Predictions 
The bridged human population PK model that approximates TMDD was used to simulate infected 
human exposures: 
where all parameters were defined as the estimates from the uninfected human model except for 
Vmax, Km, and ηVmax, which were obtained from the cynomolgus monkey population PK model. 
Population PK simulations results to compare a 16 mg/kg IV dose in infected monkeys and humans are 
shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Table 6 and Table 7. Median Cmax for healthy and projected 
infected humans were slightly higher than those for monkeys, although overall distributions were 
generally comparable. AUC(0-inf) was almost twice that for projected infected humans when compared 
to infected monkeys, while AUC(0-inf) for healthy humans was greater than double.

Special populations 
No dedicated formal intrinsic factor PK studies were conducted. 
The effects of intrinsic factors on ETI-204 PK were evaluated using both non-compartmental and 
modelling approaches. Population PK modelling was utilised to assess the impact of age, gender, body 
weight, and race.  
• 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No conclusion of impact of hepatic or renal disease on ETI-204 PK can be drawn from the human PK 
data (healthy adult subjects) provided. 
•  Gender 
After adjusting for body size, a post hoc analysis was performed where gender effects were estimated 
on the exponent for body size effects on ETI-204 CL. For females, the body weight effect was 
estimated to be 13% (95% CI: 72 %, 154%) higher when compared to males. The small difference 
and inclusion of the null value of 100% in the 95% CI indicates that ETI-204 CL is similar for males 
and females. 
•  Race 
ETI-204 CL was increased in non-white subjects (n=83) when compared to whites, with an effect 
estimate of 1.21 (1.16, 1.30). This suggests that ETI-204 exposure in non-white subjects will be 79% 
of that in white subjects. The majority of the CL distribution for non-white subjects lies within the no 
effect range. Using the updated human pop PK model (including study data from AH110), 
obiltoxaximab CL appeared to be 17% (11%, 23%) higher in non-white subjects when compared to 
white subjects. Estimates of these covariate effects were comparable to those from the previous final 
model. 
The applicant conducted backwards deletion of the covariates age and race in the model. Age and race 
were found to be statistically significant, however, the age distribution was skewed in the race groups. 
According to the model non-white subjects would have 79% of the exposure compared to that in white 
subjects. The applicant claims that this is not an issue because the majority of the CL distribution for 
non-white subjects lies within the no effect range. While this range has not been justified, the results 
should be interpreted with caution as they are based on an explorative analysis. While the covariates 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 43/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
may improve the predictability of the model, the clinical relevance is not known. This is reflected in the 
SmPC. A conclusion on impact of race cannot be made based on this analysis. 
•  Weight 
The effects of body weight on ETI-204 CL were derived from simulations using a population PK 
approach. Allometric effects on structural population PK parameters (CL, Vc, Vp, Q) were estimated 
separately with estimates (95% CI) of 0.677 (0.531, 0.815), 0.550 (0.426, 0.670), 0.486 (0.330, 
0.703), and 0.174 (0.010, 0.666) for CL, Vc, Vp, and Q respectively. Distributions of ETI-204 CL 
estimates from the bootstrap analysis are plotted for the reference subject (CL, 70 kg, white race, age 
less than 50 years). Eighthly percent and 100% of the typical 100 and 125 kg subjects are outside the 
range. For the typical 100 kg subject, the expected CL would be approximately 1.5 times that of the 
reference (70-kg subject). This indicates that ETI-204 AUC would be approximately 33% lower in the 
heavier subjects. The human pop PK model has been updated with PK data collected from AH110. 
Recalculated estimates for body weight effects on structural parameters in the same range, with 
estimates of 0.720 (0.595, 0.845), 0.608 (0.498, 0.718), 0.447 (0.254, 0.640), and 0.268 (-0,216, 
0.753) for CL, Vc, Vp, and Q respectively. Clearance at a high body weight (109 kg) was approximately 
38% higher than in a reference population. Following weight-based dosing (16 mg/kg) this results in 
an increase in AUC(0-inf) of 12%, which is deemed not clinically meaningful. 
•  Elderly 
All clinical studies were conducted in adult (≥18 years of age) healthy volunteers. No alteration of 
dosing is needed for patients ≥65 years of age, however few subjects aged 65 years and over were 
included in the studies to determine whether their PK differs from younger subjects. ETI-204 CL 
decreased with increasing age above 50 years old. Of note, data with respect to age seem not to be 
balanced with most PK collected from patients below the age of 50. The effect estimate was -0.298 
(-0.580, -0.041). This translates to CL values of 0.217 L/day (93% of the reference CL) and 0.208 
L/day (89% of the reference CL) for the typical 65 and 75-year-old subject, respectively. 
CL decreased with increasing age above 50 years old, with an re-calculated effect estimate of -0.361 
(-0.619, -0.102) using the updated pop PK model.  
•  Children 
No PK data in paediatric patients or healthy subjects are available. All PIP measures are deferred until 
a confirmed outbreak of anthrax. 
The bridged human population PK model that approximates target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) 
for infected subjects was used to simulate healthy infected human exposures in adult and paediatric 
subjects. A minimal effect of maturation on ETI-204 CL is expected. Therefore, no maturation effect 
was included in the simulation model. Simulations for this study were performed using the estimated 
adult weight effect exponents. Five hundred paediatric subjects were simulated for each weight bin 
from 5 to 50 kg, in 5 kg increments. A new weight cut-off (40 kg instead of 50 kg) has been 
introduced in the paediatric posology. Switching the cut-off from 50 to 40 kg will result in subjects in 
the 40-50 kg range to be under-exposed: the median AUC(0-inf) and Cmax for a 45 kg subject would be 
4070 μg/mL·day and 299 μg/mL compared to a median of 4600 μg/mL·day and 349 μg/mL for the 
typical 70 kg subject. These values result in changes of -12% and -15% for AUC(0-inf) and Cmax, 
respectively. A cut-off of 50kg would result in an AUC(0-inf) and Cmax for a 50-kg individual to be 29% 
and 16% greater than the median in adults. The differences are unlikely to have a clinical impact. The 
new proposed posology is considered acceptable.  
AUC(0-inf) and Cmax (simulated median, 5th and 95th percentiles) were plotted versus body weight. 
Simulated and observed adult (75 kg) exposure metrics are overlaid for comparison to paediatric

distributions. Simulated values for adult exposure metrics are shown in Table 8. Plotted simulated 
values may vary slightly, since adult values were simulated with each paediatric scenario.

For a 16 mg/kg IV dose in healthy paediatric subjects, AUC(0-inf) and Cmax increased with increasing 
body weight. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show results for ETI-204 IV doses of 24 mg/kg (15–50 kg) and 32 
mg/kg (< 15 kg).

Interactions 
No in vitro studies were carried out with ETI-204.  
For a mAb, no direct drug-drug interaction via CYP enzymes is anticipated. 
ETI-204 PK was evaluated after IV administration when given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin. 
Ciprofloxacin did not affect the PK of ETI-204. ETI-204 did not affect cytokine concentrations. 
No other antibiotic treatment than ciprofloxacin has been investigated with regard to its interaction 
potential in human.

Pre-treatment of humans with diphenhydramine to minimise the risk of hypersensitivity reactions had 
also no apparent effect on the PK of ETI-204 based on study results from AH104. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action and primary pharmacology 
B. anthracis secretes binary A2/B-type bacterial exotoxins comprising the enzyme (A) moiety LF or EF, 
each associated with PA, the common binding (B) component. The virulence of B. anthracis is 
attributed to the tripartite toxin complex, and toxic activity is expressed only when PA is combined with 
LF (forming LT) or EF (forming oedema toxin). 
ETI-204 humanised murine variable region sequences that targets B. anthracis PA, the common cell-
binding component of both anthrax toxins which are key for B. anthracis virulence and pathogenesis. 
The affinity-enhanced, de-immunised immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) mAb has a molecular weight 
of 148 kilo Dalton (kDa) and is produced in cultures of stably transfected non-secreting GS NS0 
myeloma cells. 
ETI-204 binds to domain 4 of PA (PAD4), which is the domain responsible for the binding of PA to cell 
surface receptors. Obiltoxaximab possesses a very high affinity for PA with a dissociation constant (KD) 
of 0.33 nM, which is similar to the PA receptor KD (i.e., 0.17 to 1 nM). Binding of ETI-204 to PAD4 
(Little et al, 1996; Leysath et al, 2009) prevents the cell binding of PA63-EF and PA63-LF complexes 
and prevents the entry of EF and LF into the cytosol, thereby preventing the downstream deleterious 
effects of anthrax toxin. 
Mode of action has been investigated in vivo (NZW rabbit, cynomolgus monkey) and is not expected to 
differ from between the species in humans. In addition, the ability of ETI-204/obiltoxaximab to 
neutralise LT-mediated cell death was shown in an in vitro LT neutralisation assay with murine 
macrophages (Study PCRPT0005).  
Special Studies 
Because controlled clinical trials in humans with anthrax are neither ethical nor feasible, no human 
study including PD endpoints regarding efficacy has been conducted. The planned field study AH501 
will further assess the clinical pharmacology including PK and immunogenicity of ETI-204 in the human 
target population including paediatric subjects.  
Immunogenicity in humans was low with a proportion of 3.0-8.8% subjects positive for a treatment-
emergent ATA response. ETI-204 will be administered as single dose IV, which limits the ATA-related 
effects and immunogenic potential of the antibody to be clinically relevant. 
The effect of ETI-204 on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, 
tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon γ (IFNγ)) was evaluated in clinical study AH104. No 
clinically relevant change in the cytokines could be detected.  
Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
As ETI-204 is a mAb for which the target (B. anthracis PA) does not exist in healthy subjects, PD 
studies cannot be conducted in healthy subjects. As controlled clinical trials in humans with inhalational 
anthrax are not feasible due to the rarity of this disease, no PD and PK/PD studies of ETI-204 SFL were 
conducted in patients.  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 47/113 
 
 
  
 
 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
A robust PK/PD model that adequately describes the exposure-response relationship for anti-PA mAbs 
in inhalational anthrax has not been established in animals or humans. In the absence of such a 
model, the selection of an effective human dose has been driven by the goal of achieving ETI-204 
exposures in humans that are comparable to or exceed those in animals. 
Relationship between dose and effect  
Survival Modelling 
The objectives of the Survival Analysis Modelling of ETI-204 in Anthrax-Infected Subjects were: 
•  Develop survival models to describe ETI-204 dose-response in rabbits and cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
• 
Identify an ETI-204 dose, via modelling, that is likely to be maximally efﬁcacious for preclinical 
efﬁcacy trials for treatment of inhalational anthrax. 
Data 
Infected animal studies (rabbits: AR033, cynomolgus monkeys: AP201, AP202, AP203, and AP204) 
where animals were given only ETI-204 treatment (i.e. no antibiotic co-medication) were used for 
survival modelling (time-to-event model that describes the observed survival in these studies). There 
were 259 animals included in the survival data set. Studies AR033, AP202 and AP203 were GLP-
compliant as well as blinded. Studies AP201 and AP204 were GLP-compliant and blinded to group only.  
In the ETI-204 monotherapy treatment studies, study drug treatment was triggered by the following 
clinical signs or symptoms of systemic anthrax disease: 
•  AR033: A significant increase in body temperature (SIBT, defined as a ≥ two standard 
deviation increase from baseline temperature either three consecutive times or two 
consecutive times twice), positive results in a PA-ECL assay (≥ 1 ng/mL positive control) 
developed by NIAID or 54 hours  
•  AP201, AP202, AP203 and AP204: Positive results in a PA-ECL assay (≥ 2 ng/mL positive 
control) developed by NIAID or 54 hours after challenge in monkeys (whichever occurred first). 
Results 
The original dose-response (survival) model could not be supported because it was developed using 
pooled data from monotherapy ETI-204 studies; from Study AR033 (rabbits who received placebo 
(n=14), 1 mg/kg (n=14), 4 mg/kg (n=14), 8 mg/kg (n=14) or 16 mg/kg (n=14) ETI-204) and Studies 
AP201, AP202, AP203 and AP204 (Cynomolgus monkeys who received placebo (n=63), 4 mg/kg (30), 
8 mg/kg (n=31), 16 mg/kg (n=50) or 16 mg/kg (n=16) ETI-204). However, the disease progression in 
rabbits is rapid and rabbits are more sensitive to infection of inhalational anthrax compared to 
primates. In addition, the exposure [AUC(0-inf)] is twice as high in monkeys compared to rabbits, when 
given 16 mg/kg dose, which made the interpretation of results difficult.  
The applicant was asked to run the models separately for rabbits (AR033) and monkeys (AP201, 
AP202, AP203 and AP204) and present the results in the same manner as was done for the pooled 
analysis along with a discussion of the results and the selected optimal dose. For this purpose, The 
Weibull cure-rate model was fit to survival data. The survival model also included an Emax dose-
response and an exponential effect of log10(PTT bacteraemia) on logit(psurv). Preliminary models 
demonstrated that ETI-204 dose amount did not affect rate of death.

As rabbit data are deemed only supportive with regard to dose selection and to exposure relevant for 
human dosing, only the NHP model and results are presented in the following. 
The NHP model and results: 
The NHP model estimates are in the range of those resulting from the original pooled analysis. The 
estimated ED50 is 1.990 mg/kg (95% confidence interval: 0.351–11.2). The final parameter 
estimates, and 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table 9. 
Table 9 Final parameter estimates from the dose-response survival model estimated from 
monkeys. Confidence intervals are Wald confidence intervals based on the asymptotic 
approximation to the standard error of the parameter estimate. 
Internal validation using Kaplan-Meier plots has been conducted, predicting the percent surviving in all 
studies (Figure 8– studies following 16 mg/kg).

Table 10 Predicted proportion of monkeys surviving to the end of the study as a function of 
dose and prior-to-treatment bacteraemia quantile, based on dose-response survival model. 
Model predictions shown for doses of 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/kg. PTT bacteraemia groups are 
defined as quartiles of the PTT bacteraemia distribution across the studies AP201, AP202, 
AP203 and AP204.  
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the average predicted dose-response and combined survival data from all 
preclinical NHP studies. While, both figures show a close alignment of the model predictions and 
observed data, the observed surviving proportion for the 16 and 32 mg/kg groups in are below the 
average model prediction. This difference is likely because the 16 mg/kg group is largely influenced by 
Study AP202 and the 32 mg/kg group comes solely from Study AP203 which both had higher PTT 
bacteraemia values when compared to other studies.

Figure 10 emphasises the strong relationship between both dose and PTT bacteraemia on the 
probability of survival. After separating the effects of both dose and PTT bacteraemia, we see that the 
model accurately predicts the observed survival rates in all dose groups.

Figure 10  Comparison of the observed and predicted relationship between dose and the 
probability of surviving to the end of the study. Data are pooled across studies AP201, 
AP202, AP203, and AP204. Symbols in the plot represent the number of animals at the 
observed value at that combination of dose level and PTT bacteraemia grouping, with gray 
vertical lines representing 95% CI’s. Blue lines represent the model predictions. Panels are 
defined as quartiles of the PTT bacteraemia distribution across the 4 studies. 
The model implies that higher PTT bacteraemia levels are associated with lower survival rates and 
faster rates of death among animals that die. Higher doses are associated with higher survival rates, 
with an estimated dose to give half the maximal survival beneﬁt (ED50) being 1.99 mg/kg. Rate of 
death was similar over the range of ETI-204 doses studied.  
Figure 11 shows the expected survival rate as a function of dose for PTT bacteraemia distributions 
similar to those in studies AP201, AP202, AP203, and AP204. If the PTT bacteraemia values are high 
(similar to studies AP202 and AP203), the maximum expected survival is approximately 30% and if the 
PTT bacteraemia levels are lower (similar to AP201) the maximum expected survival is approximately 
80%. At a PTT bacteraemia level of approximately 105 log10 CFU/mL, there is almost zero probability 
of survival, indicating that animals at this level are beyond a "point of no return" for survival. 
Regardless of the PTT bacteraemia levels, doses above 8 mg/kg are predicted to have relatively small 
increases in survival, with a dose of 16 mg/kg having a marginal difference in survival when compared 
to 8 and 32 mg/kg. A dose of 16 mg/kg appears to be adequate for optimal predicted probability of 
survival.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methods 
•  Quantification of ETI-204 
Given the pivotal role of both preclinical and clinical PK in terms of bridging the efficacy seen in animal 
models to the human situation, a group of bioanalytical issues have been raised at the level of major 
objections. The consequence of the bioanalytical issues raised is uncertainty regarding the reliability of 
the measured concentrations, exposure and PK parameters of ETI-204 in human and animals. As PK 
data are critical in terms of showing that the proposed human dose is adequate, i.e. that the exposure 
in humans following a 16 mg/kg dose is not lower than the exposure in primates dosed 16 mg/kg. 
All blood to be used for PK analyses (clinical and non-clinical) has been collected in serum separator 
tubes (SST) that use gel to facilitate serum separation from the blood clot. Several publications and 
tube manufacturers warn for incomplete recovery in drug quantitation settings (Bowen 2014, Karppi 
2000). It is unknown to which extent ETI-204 concentration may be affected by the tube used for 
blood collection. The applicant was requested to justify, preferably with data, that the recovery of ETI-
204 from those tubes is complete, especially considering the fact that both calibration standards and 
QCs have been prepared differently (by spiking ETI-204 directly into serum), thus giving the possibility 
of a systematic error in serum concentration. The influence of the collected blood volume had also to 
be considered.  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 53/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
It was acknowledged that without further testing of controls prepared in whole blood and subject to 
the same pre-analytical step as the study samples, absolute recovery cannot be assured. However, 
since samples from past studies were no longer available, and the assay is currently inactive, the 
applicant included the missing investigations on recovery in the protocol of the post authorisation 
efficacy field study AH501, using scavenged blood samples, if available. Also, the applicant performed 
an in vitro experiment investigating the recovery of ETI-204 spiked into human blood and processed as 
per the conventional clotting method, or in SST tubes filled at volumes corresponding to what was 
used in clinical or preclinical studies. Calibration curves and QCs were prepared as previously with 
normal serum, without SST tube. Results for ETI-204 recovery were consistent between clotting 
procedures, blood volume and the two tested ETI-204 concentrations, indicating that there is no 
recovery issue.  
Based on supplementary data provided on raised concerns, the method can be considered sufficiently 
validated, although a few issues remain outstanding: 
−  The applicant acknowledges that interference by PA63 and other B. anthracis toxin components 
has not been addressed as part of the validation of method GCL-160. This omission can 
currently be accepted considering that the human samples analysed were from healthy 
subjects not exposed to B. anthracis. It is acceptable that the validation package for the assay 
in human serum is completed as part of field study AH501 (post-authorisation efficacy study 
[PAES]) with regards to the interference with PA (63 and 83), EF, and LF (specific obligation). 
− 
Interference by ADA to be evaluated, preferably using human ADA rather than rabbit anti-
obiltoxaximab antiserum. Since the samples are no longer available and only the PK data from 
healthy animals and humans will be used for the dose selection, it is acceptable that the 
missing data is generated in the planned PAES study AH501 (specific obligation). 
−  Parallelism data had not been provided for the phase I studies in human. Parallelism should be 
performed with incurred samples from the planned open-label field study (specific obligation). 
− 
In the absence of data in haemolytic and lipemic serum, data for such samples had to be 
excluded. The applicant clarified that of all clinical samples analysed, only two were noted as 
haemolytic and none was lipemic. For the two haemolytic samples, it was considered that they 
fitted within the PK profile of the concerned subject and they were not excluded. This can be 
accepted, provided the validation in haemolytic and lipemic serum is performed as outlined in 
the protocol of the PAES study AH501 (specific obligation). 
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis 
SST tubes were used for immunogenicity samples, thus the same concerns as for the bioanalysis 
apply. The applicant discussed the implications of the results from recovery experiments from SST 
tubes with regards to the assessment of immunogenicity, since similar tubes were used for those 
samples. It was argued that due to the low biological variability between healthy individuals, and 
signals close to the instruments background, it is unlikely that differences will be shown in serum 
collected by different methods (SST vs. clot and centrifugation). This is agreed with. 
ADA analysis follows a tiered approach with a screening assay, confirmation assay and titration.  
The assay was validated in two steps using either rabbit anti-ETI-204 antiserum or later affinity 
purified rabbit anti-ETI-204 IgG as the positive control. ETI-204 is tolerated up to 200 µg/mL. 
The confirmatory assay includes an additional step, where free ETI-204 is added and disrupts the 
complex, inhibiting binding to the plate, thus resulting in a reduced signal.  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 54/113 
 
 
  
 
 
An assay for neutralizing antibodies was developed but was only used in study AH105 due to issues of 
interference with ETI-204. 
•  Population Pharmacokinetic analysis 
The objectives of the Population PK Analysis were to characterise ETI-204 population PK in healthy and 
infected NZW rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, and healthy humans. The infected cynomolgus 
monkey PK model was bridged to humans using the healthy human model for the prediction of ETI-204 
exposures in humans infected with inhalational anthrax and PK simulations were performed using the 
bridged human model to derive ETI-204 human exposures for the proposed preclinical dose. The PK 
datasets consisted of 150 cynomolgus monkey with 929 observations, and 303 human subjects with 
2830 observations. Body weight was the only covariate considered for preclinical studies. For human 
studies, bodyweight, age and race (white vs. non-white) were used for covariate modelling. During 
assessment, outstanding issues on the modelling method were justified.  
ADME 
Absorption 
The PK of obiltoxaximab are linear over the dose range of 4 mg/kg (0.25 times the lowest 
recommended dose) to 16 mg/kg following single IV administration in healthy subjects. Following 
single IV administration of obiltoxaximab 16 mg/kg in healthy, male and female human subjects, the 
mean Cmax and AUC(0-inf) were 400 ± 91.2 mcg/mL and 5170 ± 1360 mcg·day/mL, respectively. The 
half-life of obiltoxaximab was approximately 20 days (mean). 
Distribution 
Mean obiltoxaximab steady-state volume of distribution was 79.7 ± 19.2 mL/kg and greater than 
plasma volume, suggesting some tissue distribution. 
Biotransformation 
No formal metabolism studies have been conducted with obiltoxaximab. 
However, the disposition of mAbs generally involves distribution beyond the vascular space with 
potential uptake into tissues, and catabolism by proteases to small peptides and amino acids which are 
subsequently incorporated into the endogenous pool or excreted. 
Elimination 
Mean obiltoxaximab CL values were 3.35 ± 0.932 mL/d/kg and much smaller than the glomerular 
filtration rate, indicating that there is virtually no renal clearance of obiltoxaximab. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The final human structural model consisted of a two-compartment model parameterised in terms of CL, 
Vc, Vp and Q. Shrinkage on CL, Vc and Vp was low. The model minimised successfully with 3 
significant digits. Relative standard error was <30% for all parameters except bodyweight on Q 
(167%) and age effect on CL (45%). The goodness-of-fit plots do not indicate model misspecification. 
The bootstrap derived 95% CI are acceptable, except for Q and age effect on CL. The covariates 
included in the final model were bodyweight, with estimated exponents, age and race. The nonlinear

clearance model component from the cynomolgus monkey model was added to the human population 
PK, allometrically scaled to human body size. To predict ETI-204 exposures in infected humans, the 
nonlinear clearance model component from the cynomolgus monkey model was added to the human 
population PK, allometrically scaled to human body size.  
The tables of population PK simulations results (Table 6 and Table 7) of a 16 mg/kg IV dose in infected 
monkeys and humans show that the simulated exposure is higher in healthy and infected humans 
compared to infected monkeys. However, conflicting results have been presented in the different 
reports submitted where in some the simulated Cmax is lower for healthy human compared to the 
observed Cmax in infected monkeys given 16 mg/kg. This indicates that either the model cannot 
capture Cmax or that the simulations were not carried out with enough simulated subjects. As the 
concentration measured is free ETI-204 it was deemed important to compare exposures in uninfected 
(healthy) monkeys to healthy humans. In response, the applicant provided table and plots which 
showed that Cmax is similar between healthy NHP and humans. The average AUC(0-inf) is higher in 
humans compared to healthy NHP given 16 mg/kg, however the distributions overlap. 
The applicant used the dissociation constant (Kd) to calculate a target human serum concentration 
needed to bind 99.9% of PA and compared it to the simulated concentration in human with a dose of 
16 mg/kg. KD is an equilibrium constant that equals the concentration of free ETI-204 at which half of 
the total PA is associated with ETI-204. It is not independent of the concentration of PA changing. The 
applicant presented the concentration PA at which the KD was determined in the comparative binding 
affinity study and discussed it in relation to the concentrations PA observed in infected animals with or 
without antibiotics and in all cases without ETI-204 due to the analytical interference.  
As single doses are administered as bolus in animal studies and as an IV infusion over 90 minutes in 
human, Cmax values might be different. It is however agreed that this is not considered to be of clinical 
consequence. The applicant stated that based on population modelling, as well as modelling of mean 
concentration vs. time data from Study AH104, simulated administration of ETI-204 in humans by 
bolus injection instead of by 90-minute infusion would be expected to have a negligible effect on Cmax 
(<1%) and would have no impact on AUC(0-inf). The applicant showed these analyses in detail as Cmax is 
a pivotal PK measure for PK comparison across species.  
Special populations 
•  Renal and Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated formal intrinsic factor PK studies were conducted. As obiltoxaximab is a mAb, significant 
differences in PK or safety are not anticipated in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.  
•  Gender, Elderly, Race and Weight 
Obiltoxaximab PK were evaluated via a population PK analysis using serum samples from 370 healthy 
subjects who received a single IV dose across 4 clinical trials. Based on this analysis, gender (female 
versus male), race (non-Caucasian versus Caucasian), or age (elderly versus young) had no 
meaningful effects on the PK parameters for obiltoxaximab. However, clinical studies of obiltoxaximab 
did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether their PK 
differs from younger subjects. Of the 320 subjects in clinical studies of obiltoxaximab, 9.4% (30/320) 
were 65 years and over, while 2% (6/320) were 75 years and over. 
Clearance at a high body weight (109 kg) was approximately 38% higher than in a reference 
population. Following weight-based dosing (16 mg/kg) this results in an increase in AUC(0-inf) of 12%, 
which is not clinically meaningful. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 56/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Children 
Obiltoxaximab PK have not been evaluated in children. The dosing recommendations in Table 2, 
section 4.2 of SmPC (Recommended paediatric dose of obiltoxaximab [weight-based dosing]), are 
derived from simulations using a population PK approach designed to match the observed adult 
exposure to obiltoxaximab at a 16 mg/kg dose. 
Pharmacodynamics and PK/PD 
Obiltoxaximab binds free PA with an affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.33 nM.  
In vitro, obiltoxaximab binds to PA from the Ames, Vollum, and Sterne strains of B. anthracis. The 
epitope on PA to which obiltoxaximab binds is conserved across reported strains of B. anthracis. 
In vitro studies in a cell-based assay, using murine macrophages, suggest that obiltoxaximab 
neutralises the toxic effects of LT, a combination of PA + LF.  
In vivo efficacy studies in NZW rabbits and cynomolgus macaques challenged with the spores of the 
Ames strain of B. anthracis by the inhalational route, showed a dose-dependent increase in survival 
following treatment with obiltoxaximab. Exposure to B. anthracis spores resulted in increasing 
concentrations of PA in the serum of NZW rabbits and cynomolgus macaques. After treatment with 
obiltoxaximab there was a decrease in PA concentrations in a majority of surviving animals. PA 
concentrations in placebo animals increased until they died. 
NHP model implies that higher prior to treatment bacteraemia levels are associated with lower survival 
rates and faster rates of death among animals that die. Higher obiltoxaximab doses are associated 
with higher survival rates, with an estimated dose to give half the maximal survival beneﬁt (ED50) 
being 1.99 mg/kg. Rate of death was similar over the range of ETI-204 doses studied.  
Regardless of the PTT bacteraemia levels, doses above 8 mg/kg are predicted to have relatively small 
increases in survival, with a dose of 16 mg/kg having a marginal difference in survival when compared 
to 8 and 32 mg/kg. A dose of 16 mg/kg appears to be adequate for optimal predicted probability of 
survival. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The major objection and all other remaining concerns were successfully resolved.  
A PAES, i.e. the phase 4 open-label field study AH501 is planned to be conducted upon an anthrax 
outbreak in a country where obiltoxaximab is authorised and available. As a stated secondary 
objective, clinical pharmacology assessments will include the PK evaluation of obiltoxaximab and the 
incidence of ATAs. 
The validation of the method in human serum is however not yet considered as fully adequate. The 
following aspects should be validated prior to use of the assay for sample analysis for clinical study 
AH501: interference by PA (63 and 83), EF, LF and ADAs, and assay performance in haemolytic and 
lipemic serum. Parallelism should be performed with incurred samples from the planned PAES study. 
It is agreed that outstanding aspects on the method validation will be performed as part of the planned 
field study AH501 (PAES).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Since controlled clinical efficacy trials exposing humans to anthrax spores would neither be ethical nor 
feasible, the efficacy of ETI-204 was evaluated in two established animal models of inhalational 
anthrax, NZW rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. The pathophysiology of anthrax toxin in both rabbits 
and monkeys is considered similar to humans, even though a more rapid development of the disease 
can be expected in rabbits that are herbivores and highly sensitive to anthrax infection. 
Several studies have been executed in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys challenged with B. anthracis 
spores, where ETI-204 has been administered both as monotherapy treatment of anthrax and as 
concomitant treatment with antibiotic.

2.5.1.  Dose selection 
The maximally efficacious dose was identified empirically across the range of IV doses that were 
evaluated in monotherapy studies in both species.  
The selection of 16 mg/kg as the maximally efficacious dose in animals was, as stated by the 
applicant, supported by population PD modelling which included an assessment of the effect of 
covariates, including dose, species, and prior-to-treatment bacteraemia on survival. The modelling 
suggests an inverse correlation between survival and prior-to-treatment quantitative bacteraemia 
(figure below). Two of the included studies (AP201 and AP204) were not completely blinded and the 
applicant was asked to clarify whether this could have had any impact on the outcome of the studies. 
Based on the applicant’s response to this issue, it appears that there was no obvious impact of the two 
blinding methods on survival outcomes for the control group albeit some effects were observed for 
euthanised animals (difference of 21%). Overall, the survival in the control groups across the 
performed studies in monkey was stated to be consistent with expected survival in untreated animals 
based on published literature and natural history studies and the blinding schema did not appear to 
impact the overall survival outcomes for the control group. Thus, the inclusion of all four monkey 
studies (AP201, AP204, AP203 and AP202) and separate analysis from rabbit data in the PK modelling 
appears acceptable.

The four quadrants represent quartiles of the prior-to-treatment bacteraemia distribution across all 4 studies. 
Markers indicate the total number of animals (monkeys) at each observed mean data point; the prediction based on 
modelling of survival data and dose (solid blue line) is overlaid. Grey vertical lines represent 95% confidence 
intervals. CFU=colony forming units/mL. 
Based on the models, it has been suggested that 8 mg/kg is close to the plateau of the modelled 
dose-response relationship, providing approximately 90% of the maximal response. Therefore, an 8 
mg/kg dose should also be expected to confer a near-maximal efficacious response; however, the 16

mg/kg dose exceeds the minimum effective dose as well as the ED90. The selected human dose of 
16 mg/kg administered IV was based on a comparison of systemic exposures in humans to those in 
animals (NHP) at the maximally efficacious animal dose of 16 mg/kg IV. 
After IV administration of a 16 mg/kg dose of ETI-204 in humans, serum ETI-204 Cmax values were 
comparable to the exposure in animals (rabbit and monkey, pooled results), suggesting that this 
dose provides maximum initial concentrations was sufficient to neutralise systemic PA. After a 16 
mg/kg IV dose, AUC(0-inf) values were at least twice as high in humans as in infected animals and 
ETI-204 serum concentrations are sustained at higher levels over a longer period of time in humans 
than in animals.

The exposure in healthy NHP has not been presented for the recommended dose 16 mg/kg, therefore a 
direct comparison between exposure in infected and healthy animals is not possible without further 
calculations. In addition, due to bioanalysis issues (e.g. interference by target) such comparisons must 
be done with caution. The dose selection is further discussed in the clinical section for PK/PD. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Monotherapy studies (AR033, AP204, AP202 and AP301) 
To evaluate activity of the mAb ETI-204, four monotherapy studies including rabbit and monkey 
were provided which were GLP-status and blinded. Those are considered to constitute the pivotal 
efficacy studies and are listed in the table below. Of these, Study AP204 was only blinded to group but 
the applicant showed that this did not have any impact on the outcome of the study and this study is 
therefore considered as pivotal. Other monotherapy studies were also provided, however, since they 
investigated dose levels other than 16 mg/kg, they were unblinded or without GLP-status, they are 
considered supportive (see section of supportive studies).

Methods  
The efficacy of ETI-204 as monotherapy treatment for inhalational anthrax was investigated after a 
single IV dose in one study in NZW rabbits (AR033, dose range: 0, 1, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg, IV) and in 
three studies including cynomolgus monkeys (AP202, AP204 and AP301, dose range: 0, 4, 8, 16 
mg/kg, IV). The studies were stated to be randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in 
which IV ETI-204 alone was administered to rabbits or monkeys, which were exhibiting clinical signs or 
symptoms of systemic anthrax. All studies had GLP status and were blinded. Study AP204 was only 
blinded to group but the applicant showed that this did not have any impact on the outcome of the 
studies and this study is thus considered as pivotal. Two different formulations of ETI-204 were used 
(pilot and commercial). In two monkey studies (AP202 and AP301) animals were treated with the 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 63/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commercial formulation whereas ETI-204 in the pilot formulation was administered in rabbits (AR033) 
as well as in monkeys (Studies AP204 and AP202).  
Animals in the ETI-204 monotherapy studies were aerosol challenged with an approximate B. anthracis 
(Ames strain) spore dose of 200 LD50 (±50%).  
The animals were observed every 6 hours beginning 18 hours (rabbits) or 24 hours (monkeys) after 
the median challenge time for all animals on a given challenge day and ending at either 168 hours (7 
days; rabbits) or 192 hours (8 days; monkeys) after the median challenge time, for mortality and 
outward clinical signs of anthrax disease such as lethargy, respiratory distress, moribundity, activity 
(i.e., recumbent, weak, or unresponsive), seizures. After study Day 7 in rabbits and study Day 8 in 
monkeys, animals were observed twice daily until the day of euthanasia when they were observed 
once immediately prior to euthanasia. All surviving animals were euthanised on Day 28. 
Animals who exhibited any of the following criteria during the monitoring period were immediately 
euthanised: 
- 
Presence of any hyperactivity or seizure denoting primary central nervous system disease 
-  Respiratory distress, dyspnoea, or forced abdominal respirations 
-  Unresponsive to touch or external stimuli 
-  Moribundity 
If all following clinical signs listed below were observed in any of the treatment studies in monkeys, 
illness was considered irreversible and the animal was euthanised: 
-  Recumbency and weakness 
-  ≥20% body weight loss 
- 
Total anorexia with a duration > 48 hours 
Criteria for euthanasia because of irreversible disease were not established in the rabbit studies 
because of the rapid progression of disease and death in this species. 
Treatments 
In study AP301 treatment was initiated at different time points; 18 h, 24 h, 36 h post exposure. 
In the studies AP202, AP204 and AR033, treatment of ETI-204 was triggered by the following clinical 
signs or symptoms of systemic anthrax disease: 
-  A significant increase in body temperature, defined as ≥ two standard deviation (SD) increase 
from baseline temperature either three consecutive times or two consecutive times twice 
(SIBT). SIBT was not used as a treatment trigger in monkeys because of their strong diurnal 
temperature rhythms  
-  A SIBT, positive results in a PA-ECL assay (≥ 1 ng/mL positive control) developed by NIAID or 
54 hours (AR033) or 72 hours (AR021) after challenge in rabbits (whichever occurred first). 
SIBT was defined as a temperature reading 
- 
Positive results in a PA-ECL assay (≥ 2 ng/mL positive control) developed by NIAID or 54 hours 
after challenge in monkeys (whichever occurred first) 
These triggers were selected based on results from the natural history studies which demonstrated 
that SIBT was a reliable indicator of an inhalational anthrax infection in NZW rabbits and detectable 
EMA/524933/2020

serum PA coincides with detection of bacteraemia, without the time lag associated with bacterial 
cultures, in both NZW rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Objectives 
To evaluate efficacy of ETI-204 in monotherapy studies for the treatment of inhalational anthrax after 
single IV administration in cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the monotherapy treatment studies was the survival rate at the end of 
the study.  
Secondary endpoint 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was survival time. 
Bacteraemia 
Quantitative bacteraemia (CFU/mL blood) was assessed in studies AR033, AP202, AP204 and AP301 as 
a PD parameter since the appearance of bacteria in the blood signifies a systemic anthrax infection and 
likely infection of peripheral organs. Thus, bacteraemia is also considered a reliable marker of the 
severity of disease [Weis et al, 2011]. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The studies AR033, AP202 and AP301 were blinded according to the following procedure. The Study 
Director, Sponsor, microbiologists, pathologist, neuropathologist (i.e., Tox Path Specialists, LLC), 
technicians performing the dosing, and all technicians assessing the animals were blinded to the 
contents of the dosing vials and animal group assignments. Once animals were randomised to a group, 
challenge day, and challenge order, the results were sent to the Study Coordinator and Quality 
Assurance (QA) Auditor. The QA Auditor verified the randomisation and then provided the Study 
Director with the randomisation information regarding animal ID, challenge day, and challenge order 
but not the group assignments. Group assignments remained blinded to the Study Director and 
Sponsor until sample analysis was complete and data summary tables were audited ("database lock"). 
Once the summary tables audit was complete, the group assignments were released to the Study 
Director, but the Study Director did not release the group assignment information to the study 
pathologist or neuropathologist. 
Study AP204 was blinded to group only. The applicant was asked to clarify whether this could have had 
any impact on the outcome of the studies. Based on the applicant’s response to this issue, it appears 
that there was no obvious impact of the two blinding methods on survival outcomes for the control 
group albeit some effects were observed for euthanised animals (difference of 21%). Overall, the 
survival in the control groups across the performed studies in monkey was stated to be consistent with 
expected survival in untreated animals based on published literature and natural history studies and 
the blinding schema did not appear to impact the overall survival outcomes for the control group. 
Thus, the inclusion of study AP204 as pivotal study appears acceptable.

Statistical methods 
Sample Size 
The sample size for each study was based upon the ability to detect a statistically significant difference 
in survival rate between the control and ETI-204 groups. Table below summarises for each study the 
hypothesised survival rate for each group, the number of animals per group, and the resultant power 
based upon a specific statistical test at a  predetermined significance level.

Calculations were conducted using the statistical package StatXact. Sample size calculations did not 
include adjustments for multiple comparisons. 
Analysis populations 
Statistical analyses for the monotherapy treatment studies were conducted using a modified Intent-to-
Treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomised animals that were positive for bacteraemia prior to 
study treatment. 
Primary analysis 
The intended primary statistical method for the primary endpoint was either Fisher's exact test or the 
Boschloo's exact test with a Berger-Boos correction of gamma = 0.001. Statistical significance was 
declared at either the 0.025 (one-sided) or 0.05 (two-sided) level. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was survival time. In the monotherapy treatment studies, survival 
time was summarised both from the time of spore challenge and from the time of treatment. 
Survival curves were plotted for each group. Pairwise comparisons to the control group were conducted 
and p-values for both the Wilcoxon test and the log rank test were presented.

Bacteraemia 
A comparison of the bacteraemia concentrations in the IV ETI-204 monotherapy treatment studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys as well as to a BARDA meta-analysis is provided in table below. The BARDA 
meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate the ability of the NZW rabbit and nonhuman primate 
models to show an added benefit of adjunct therapies over antibiotics for therapeutic treatment of 
anthrax and to achieve a better understanding of these models. Data from 14 separate studies were 
included in the meta-analysis. It should however be kept in mind that only AP204, AP202 and AP301 
were considered as main studies since they were blinded and had GLP-status. 
Animals in AP204, AP203, and AP202 had higher bacteraemia concentrations immediately prior to 
treatment than animals in AP201. Geometric mean CFU/mL in each group in AP203 and AP202 were 
almost a log10 higher than in the groups in AP204 and the geometric mean CFU/mL in each group in 
AP204 were almost a log10 higher than AP201. Additionally, there were more animals with 
bacteraemia concentrations ≥1 x 105 CFU/mL immediately prior to treatment in AP203 and AP202 than 
in AP204 and AP201. AP201 had the smallest number of animals with bacteraemia concentrations ≥1 x 
105 CFU/mL. 
Treatment was triggered for all animals in study AP203 and for most of the animals in AP201 and 
AP202 by a positive result in the PA-ECL assay. One animal (7.1%) in the placebo group and 2 animals 
(14.3%) in the 4 mg/kg group in AP201, 2 animals (12.5%) in the 16 mg/kg group in AP204, and 1

animal (6.3%) in AP202 (16 mg/kg commercial batch) were triggered by time. The median time to 
trigger and median time to positive bacteraemia were similar across the groups including monkeys (the 
average time from challenge until treatment ranged from 36.2 hr to 37.5 hr (Study AP203), 34.1 hr to 
35.1 hr (Study AP202), 41.3 hr to 44.5 hr (Study AP203), respectively.

replaced with 17 cfu/mL (1/2 LOD) and values below LOQ are replaced with 500 cfu/mL (1/2 LOQ). AP204 and 
AP203: LOD = 3 cfu/mL and LOQ = 100 cfu/mL, respectively; for computational purposes, values below LOD are 
replaced with 2 cfu/mL (1/2 LOD rounded to the nearest integer); values below LOQ are replaced with 50 cfu/mL 
(1/2 LOQ). AP202: LOD = 3 cfu/mL; for computational purposes, values below LOD are replaced with 2 cfu/mL (1/2 
LOD rounded to the nearest integer) and values reported as positive are replaced with 50 cfu/mL. 
In the rabbit study AR033, geometric mean B. anthracis and PA concentrations before treatment were

ETI-204 as concomitant treatment with antibiotic 
Four studies of ETI-204 as concomitant treatment with antibiotics were conducted in the NZW rabbit 
model of inhalational anthrax, using human equivalent doses of antibiotics. These studies were open-
label (unblinded) trials, and only one was executed in GLP-compliance.

An overview of ETI-204 studies with concomitant administration of antibiotics at human equivalent 
dose is provided in the table below. Four studies were also provided using significant lower doses of 
antibiotic; thus, they are considered supportive only.

Study design and objectives  
Human Equivalent Antibiotic Dose Studies 
The human equivalent antibiotic dose studies were randomised, controlled, open-label, parallel-group, 
factorial design studies that were conducted in NZW rabbits with levofloxacin. Only one of them had 
GLP status (AR007). 
NIAID Studies 1030 and 1045 were exploratory studies that were conducted for development of an 
animal model to assess the additive benefit of an antitoxin in combination with an antimicrobial in the 
treatment of inhalational anthrax. Because antimicrobials alone achieve high survival rates in animal 
anthrax models when administered early, a delayed-treatment design was used in NIAID Studies 1030 
and 1045. In the delayed-treatment design, the delay in treatment was intended by the applicant to 
result in rabbits with advanced inhalational anthrax and therefore, a reduced probability of survival. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 72/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NIAID Study 1030 was the first model development study including ETI-204 to be conducted with a 
delayed treatment regimen and a human equivalent antibiotic dose. The objective of NIAID Study 1030 
was to investigate the feasibility of a 96-hour delayed-treatment model for an added benefit 
assessment with a human equivalent antibiotic dose. 
NIAID Study 1045 was conducted after NIAID Study 1030 to investigate the feasibility of a 72-hour 
delayed treatment model for an added benefit assessment of ETI-204 with a human equivalent 
antibiotic dose. 
AR034 was a B. anthracis re-challenge study conducted to investigate whether ETI-204 prevents the 
development of protective endogenous immunity to PA. The first phase of this study provides data on 
the effect of co-administration of ETI-204 and a human equivalent antibiotic dose at 30 hours following 
exposure to B. anthracis spores and thus, the results are presented in this section of combination 
studies with antibiotics. 
AR007 was conducted to investigate the efficacy of ETI-204 administered IV or IM, alone or as 
concomitant treatment with a human equivalent antibiotic dose, in preventing inhalational anthrax 
when administered 9 hours following exposure to B. anthracis spores. The rationale for co-
administration of an anti-toxin and antimicrobials in the post-exposure prophylaxis setting (9 hours 
after spore challenge) is based on findings in experimental animal models indicating that antibiotic 
treatment early after B. anthracis challenge may lead to persistence of spores and disease 
development following antibiotic cessation.  
Lower than Human Equivalent Antibiotic Dose Studies 
According to the applicant, the studies were randomised, controlled, open-label, parallel group, 
factorial design studies that were conducted as exploratory studies to develop an animal model that 
allowed for the detection of an interaction (additive, synergistic, antagonistic) between an antitoxin 
and antibiotics in the treatment of inhalational anthrax. Lower than human equivalent doses were 
selected for these studies with the rationale that this would allow for any possible interaction between 
ETI-204 and antibiotics to be more easily detected. A delayed treatment design was also used in these 
studies to reflect the projected clinical scenario in which antibiotics are not 100% effective when 
administered for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. 
AR028 was an exploratory, model development study conducted with ETI-204 and a lower than human 
equivalent dose of oral levofloxacin in NZW rabbits. AR028 was conducted to investigate the feasibility 
of using a treatment delay of 72 hours after exposure to B. anthracis spores for detecting an 
interaction between ETI-204 and antibiotics. 
NIAID Study AP-10-055 was conducted to develop a partial protection NZW rabbit model to evaluate 
the protective efficacy of adjunct antitoxin therapy with an additional antibiotic (i.e., IV doxycycline). 
NIAID Study 1056 was an exploratory model development study in cynomolgus monkeys that was 
conducted to investigate the feasibility of delaying treatment relative to the onset of toxemia rather 
than exposure to B. anthracis spores. Delayed treatment with ETI-204 in combination with an antibiotic 
or an antibiotic alone relative to toxemia onset was used to determine if this synchronised the time of 
treatment with disease severity. 
NIAID Study 1056 was conducted with oral ciprofloxacin. 
NIAID Study 2469 was conducted after NIAID Study 1056 to continue model development in 
cynomolgus monkeys and to confirm that the results seen in NIAID Study 1056 were reproducible. 
Delayed treatment relative to the onset of toxemia was also used in this study. The study included two 
different doses of oral ciprofloxacin.

Randomisation and blinding 
Animals in the antibiotic combination studies, except for NIAID Study AP-10-055, were weighed at the 
time of quarantine and then, within each gender, grouped into tertiles based upon their weight. 
Separate randomisations were conducted within each of the six strata defined by gender (male, 
female) and weight. 
Animals were then randomised to a challenge day such that there was approximately an equal number 
of animals from each group on each challenge day. A randomisation was then conducted within each 
challenge day to randomise the order of challenge. 
Randomisation was not performed in NIAID Study AP-10-055. 
All the antibiotic combination studies were open-label studies and thus, blinding was not used. 
Conduct  
Spore challenge  
Spore challenge occurred before the administration of study treatment in all the antibiotic combination 
studies.  
Animals in all antibiotic combination studies were aerosol challenged on Day 0 with a targeted 200 
LD50 dose of B. anthracis spores (Ames strain) aerosolised by a Collison nebuliser and delivered via a 
nose-only (rabbits) or head-only (monkeys) inhalation exposure chamber.  
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was conducted in several of the antibiotic combination 
studies to confirm sensitivity of the challenge spore lot to either levofloxacin (AR028 and NIAID Studies 
1030 and 1045) or ciprofloxacin (NIAID Studies 1056 and 2469). Additionally, bacteria isolated from 
the blood of animals that died on study were subjected to MIC testing to confirm susceptibility to either 
levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. 
The challenge spore lot used in NIAID Study AP-10-055 was also prepared using a standardised 
process for spore lot production and characterisation. The spore lot used in this study had a spore titre 
of 1.72 x 1010 spores/mL without significant vegetative cells or debris.  
Monitoring Period 
Human Equivalent Antibiotic Dose Studies 
In NIAID Studies 1030 and 1045, animals were observed every 6 hours beginning 18 hours after the 
median challenge time for all animals and ending at 72 hours after the median challenge time for 
mortality and outward clinical signs of disease. After study Day 3, animals were observed twice daily 
until Day 28 when they were observed once immediately prior to scheduled euthanasia. In AR007, 
animals were observed twice daily for 34 days regarding mortality and outward clinical signs of anthrax 
disease until the day of euthanasia when they were observed once immediately prior to scheduled 
euthanasia. 
In AR034 (Phase 1), animals were observed twice daily for mortality and outward clinical signs of 
anthrax disease. Survival in Phase 1 was assessed at 9 months. 
Rabbits who exhibited any of the following during the monitoring period in NIAID Study 1030, NIAID 
Study 1045, AR007, or AR034 were immediately euthanised:

- 
Presence of any hyperactivity or seizure denoting primary central nervous system disease (ie, 
meningitis or encephalitis) 
-  Respiratory distress, dyspnea, or forced abdominal respirations 
-  Unresponsive to touch or external stimuli 
-  Moribundity 
Lower than Human Equivalent Antibiotic Dose Studies 
Rabbits were observed twice daily in AR028 for mortality and outward clinical signs of anthrax disease 
until Day 28 when they were observed once immediately prior to scheduled euthanasia. 
In NIAID Study AP-10-055, appearance, natural behaviour, provoked behaviour, and neurological 
behaviour of the rabbits were observed and scored twice daily until Day 28 or Day 29 (scores of 0 were 
considered normal and scores > 0 indicated worsening). Rabbits with an elevated score (ie, score of 4-
6) were monitored with increased frequency (3 times per day). 
In NIAID Studies 1056 and 2469, monkeys were observed every 6 hours beginning 24 hours after the 
median challenge time for all animals and ending at 192 hours (8 days) after the median challenge 
time for mortality and outward clinical signs of anthrax disease. After study Day 8, monkeys were 
observed twice daily until Day 28 when they were observed once immediately prior to scheduled 
euthanasia. 
Animals who exhibited any of the following criteria during the monitoring period in AR028, NIAID Study 
1056, and NIAID Study 2469 were immediately euthanised: 
- 
Presence of any hyperactivity or seizure denoting primary central nervous system disease 
-  Respiratory distress, dyspnoea, or forced abdominal respirations 
-  Unresponsive to touch or external stimuli 
-  Moribundity 
In NIAID Study AP-10-055, animals with a score indicative of a very poor health status (ie, score ≥ 7) 
during the monitoring period were euthanised. 
If all following clinical signs listed below were observed in either NIAID Study 1056 or NIAID Study 
2469, illness was considered irreversible and the animal was euthanised: 
-  Recumbency and weakness 
-  ≥ 20% body weight loss 
-  Body temperature < 97°F, indicative of shock 
- 
Total anorexia with a duration > 48 hours 
Treatment Administration 
In the antibiotic combination studies, treatment was administered at varying times following exposure 
to B. anthracis spores to evaluate the effect of ETI-204 in combination with antibiotics from early to 
late in the disease course. 
Human Equivalent Antibiotic Dose Studies 
In the human equivalent antibiotic dose studies, a single IV ETI-204 dose, ranging from 4 mg/kg to 16 
mg/kg, was administered in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP either alone or in 
combination with the first dose of multiple oral doses of 50 mg/kg levofloxacin (once daily x 3 days 
[NIAID Study 1030] or x 5 days [AR007]) or placebo (water). In AR007, ETI-204 was given at a fixed 
dose of either 10 or 20 mg/rabbit. The body weights of rabbits in this study ranged from 2.2 to 2.7 kg; 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 75/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
thus, the actual doses administered were approximately 4 mg/kg IV and 8 mg/kg IM. These ETI-204 
doses were administered either alone or in combination with the first dose of multiple oral doses of 50 
mg/kg levofloxacin (once daily x 5 days). The control group in NIAID Studies 1030 and 1045 was 
untreated whereas the control group in AR007 and AR034 was placebo treated (i.e. sterile 0.9% 
sodium chloride for injection). IV ETI-204 and IV placebo were administered using a vascular access 
port (except in AR034) and levofloxacin and its placebo (i.e. water) were administered by oral gavage. 
In AR034, IV ETI-204 and IV placebo were administered using the marginal ear vein. IM ETI-204 in 
AR007 was administered in the hind leg. 
ETI-204 alone, levofloxacin alone, and ETI-204 in combination with the first dose of levofloxacin was 
administered at 9 hours, 30 hours, and 72 hours following exposure to B. anthracis spores in AR007, 
AR034, and NIAID Study 1045, respectively. In NIAID Study 1030, ETI-204 alone was administered 
upon a SIBT (significant increased body temperature) whereas ETI-204 in combination with the first 
dose of levofloxacin and the first dose of levofloxacin alone were administered at 96 hours following 
spore challenge. 
The levofloxacin dose of 50 mg/kg was based on comparability of the Cmax values with those obtained 
from PK studies in human adults who received antibiotics at the dosages recommended for post-
exposure prophylaxis. 
Lower than Human Equivalent Antibiotic Dose Studies 
In the lower than human equivalent antibiotic dose studies, a single IV ETI-204 dose of either 8 or 16 
mg/kg was administered in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP either alone (NIAID Study 
1056) or with the first dose of multiple doses of either levofloxacin (AR028), doxycycline (NIAID Study 
AP-10-055), or ciprofloxacin (NIAID Studies 1056 and 2469). The control group in NIAID Studies 1056 
and 2469 was untreated whereas the control group in AR028 and NIAID Study AP-10-055 was placebo 
treated (i.e. sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for injection). Treatment was administered using a vascular 
access port in rabbits and via the saphenous vein to monkeys. 
Treatment was administered at 72 hours following B. anthracis spore exposure in AR028 and at first 
positive PA-ECL or 30 hours after spore challenge in NIAID Study AP-10-055. In NIAID Study 1056, 
treatment was administered relative to disease progression, with ETI-204 administered at positive 
results in a PA-ECL assay and ETI-204 plus ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin alone administered at 24±12 
hours after detection of PA. Treatment was also administered relative to disease progression in NIAID 
Study 2469 (i.e. 24±12 hours following positive results in PA-ECL assay). 
Selection of a lower than human equivalent levofloxacin dose of 6.5 mg/kg (3 days by oral gavage) in 
AR028 was based on the results of two delayed-treatment studies with levofloxacin in anthrax-infected 
rabbits, AR023 and AR027, that were designed to identify a levofloxacin dose resulting in ~50% 
survival. 
Selection of the lower than human equivalent ciprofloxacin dose of 10 mg/kg/day (x 4 days by oral 
gavage) for NIAID Studies 1056 and 2469 was based on the results of the antibiotic therapy study, 
Study 931, in which 63% of animals treated with a 10 mg/kg ciprofloxacin regimen at 24±12 hours 
after disease confirmation by positive results in a PA-ECL assay survived. 
The doxycycline dose of 2 mg/kg (twice daily x 3 days IV) used in NIAID Study AP-10-055 was based 
on the results of previous studies conducted at USAMRIID in which this dose resulted in 40-60% 
survival.

Statistical methods 
Sample Size 
Sample size calculations were based upon both the ability to detect a statistically significant difference 
in survival rates between the control and treatment groups and between the antibiotic group and the 
combination group. The table below summarises the hypothesised survival rates for each group, the 
number of animals per group, and the resultant power based upon a specific statistical test at a 
predetermined significance level. Sample size calculations were not performed for NIAID Study AP-10-
055 and AR034.

Calculations were conducted using the statistical package StatXact. Sample size calculations did not 
include adjustments for multiple comparisons.  
Analysis populations 
Statistical analysis for the combination studies were conducted using a modified ITT population, 
defined as all animals that survived to treatment, regardless of bacteraemia status, with the exception 
of AR034 Phase 1 in which survival rates were summarised for all challenged animals regardless of 
bacteraemia status. 
Additional analyses of survival rates were also performed using all challenged animals and bacteraemic 
only animals. 
Demographics and Pre-treatment Disease Characteristics 
Demographic and pre-treatment disease characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics. 
Because treatment was delayed in these studies and it was anticipated that a number of animals might 
die before treatment, demographics were summarised for the groups at spore challenge and at 
treatment for all studies except for AR034. For AR034, demographics were summarised at challenge 
only. 
Demographic variables included gender, weight, and age. Pre-treatment disease characteristics 
included challenge spore dose, quantitative bacteraemia, quantitative PA, time to positive bacteraemia, 
and time to positive PA. 
Time to positive bacteraemia was defined as the time from spore challenge to the first measurement 
greater than the LOD in either a qualitative or quantitative assay of bacteraemia. Time to positive PA 
was defined as the time from spore challenge to the first positive measurement for PA in either an ECL 
assay or ELISA. 
Primary analysis 
The intended statistical method for the primary endpoint was Fisher's exact test; the test was one-
sided and statistical significance was declared at the 0.05 level. However, the applicant chose to 
present “a unified set of results across all the studies”, both the results from the Boschloo’s exact test 
as well as the Fisher's exact test are presented. The applicant assessed significance at the 0.025 level 
consistent with the application of one-tailed test and with the approach used for other studies. 
Two statistical procedures were utilised to compare survival rates: Fisher’s exact test and Boschloo's 
exact test with a Berger-Boos correction of gamma = 0.001 [McDonald et al, 1977; Mehrotra et al, 
2003]. The resultant p-values for both procedures are presented as one-sided with statistical 
significance declared at the 0.025 level. In the human equivalent antibiotic dose studies, Fisher's exact 
test was conducted using Proc FREQ of SAS® version 9.3 for AR034, Proc FREQ of SAS® version 9.1 
for NIAID Studies 1030 and 1045, and Proc FREQ of SAS® version 9.1.3 for AR007. 
In the lower than human equivalent antibiotic dose studies, Fisher's exact test was conducted using 
Stata®version 12.1 for AR028, Proc Freq of SAS® version 9.4 for NIAID Study AP-10-055, Proc FREQ 
of SAS® version 9.1 for NIAID Study 1056, and SAS® version 9.3 for NIAID Study 2469. Boschloo’s 
exact test was conducted using the program developed at N.C. State University by Berger and Boos. 
An exact 95% CI, based on the score statistic using Proc Freq of SAS® version 9.4, is presented for 
the difference in survival rates. P-values for differences in survival rates of treated groups compared to 
the control group and the combination group compared to the antibiotic alone that are included on 
survival plots, the survival results are based upon Boschloo’s exact test. Survival results are discussed 
for the mITT population.

Results [ETI-204 administered concomitant with antibiotic (human equivalent dose)] 
Disposition and Analysis Populations 
Overall, 57 rabbits were randomised in AR007: 9 to placebo; 9 to ~4 mg/kg ETI-204 IV; 9 to ~8 
mg/kg ETI-204 IM; 12 to levofloxacin alone; 9 to ~4 mg/kg ETI-204 IV plus levofloxacin; and 9 to 
~8 mg/kg ETI-204 IM plus levofloxacin. All randomised animals were challenged with B. anthracis 
spores and survived to treatment at 9 hours following spore challenge. Levofloxacin was 
administered orally (50 mg/kg, once daily, PO) for five days (5 total doses) alone or in combination 
with ETI-204.

Outcomes  
The applicant concludes that ETI-204 did not have a negative impact on the rate of survival when co-
administered with a human equivalent dose of levofloxacin in rabbits. The only statistically significant 
difference observed between treatment with antibiotic vs concomitant treatment with full dose of 
antibiotics was in study AR007, where 33% (n=12) of the subjects treated with levofloxacin (per os) 
survived compared to 100% (n=9) treated with ETI-204 and levofloxacin, the treatment was 
administered 9 h post challenge. The applicant considers this study supports both concomitant 
treatment with antibiotics as well as post-exposure prophylaxis and emphasise that ETI-204 did not 
have a negative impact on the rate of survival. All treatments administered in the study AR007 
statistically significantly increased the survival rate compared to placebo. 
The results (survival rates) from the studies where concomitant administration of antibiotics and ETI-
204 were conducted with a human equivalent antibiotic dose (i.e., yields similar exposure to that 
achieved by the recommended doses in humans) and ETI-204 doses from 4 to 16 mg/kg are presented 
in table below. The antibiotic used in those studies was levofloxacin. 
A summary of the survival rates in the ETI-204 studies with concomitant administration of antibiotics 
at human equivalent dose is provided in the table below.

Summary of main efficacy results  
Monotherapy of ETI-204 (Studies AR033, AP202, AP204, AP301) 
The activity of ETI-204 in neutralizing the anthrax toxin was evaluated in the monotherapy studies. 
Four studies are considered as pivotal efficacy monotherapy studies since they were blinded and had 
GLP-status. In study AR033 a statistically significant difference in survival rate compared to placebo 
was observed when 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg was administered IV with a numerical survival rate of 33-69%. 
In the three studies including monkeys, high survival rate (83-100%) was observed in study AP301 
when ETI-204 was administered IM at the doses 8 or 16 mg/kg up to 24 h post exposure, however no 
difference was seen when the treatment was initiated 36 h post exposure. In study AP204 a 
statistically significant difference in survival rate was observed between placebo (6%) and 16 mg/kg IV 
administered ETI-204 (47%), however no difference was seen between placebo (6%) and 4 mg/kg IV 
administered ETI-204 (25%). In study AP202 a statistically significant difference in survival rate 
compared to placebo (0%) was observed for 16 mg/kg ETI-204 (two formulations; pilot and 
commercial) administered IV, the survival rate, however was modest (31-35%).  
The secondary efficacy endpoint, survival time from spore challenge, was achieved in all four main 
studies. Significant increases in survival time from spore challenge compared to the placebo group 
were seen for the 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg IV ETI-204 groups in study AR033 and 16 mg/kg 
IV groups in AP202 and AP204; the 4 mg/kg ETI-204 group in AP204 did not have an increased 
survival time relative to the placebo group. Following IM administration of ETI-204 (8 and 16 mg/kg, 
IM), an increased survival time compared to the placebo group was seen in monkeys in study AP301 at 
all ETI-204 groups except for the 8 and 16 mg/kg group at 36 hours. 
It was noted that the response rate was time dependent, where the earlier the treatment was initiated 
the higher survival rate, and a lower bacterial count was associated with a higher survival rate.  
Concomitant use of ETI-204 and antibiotics 
No add-on benefit of ETI-204 was demonstrated in the studies using human equivalent doses of 
antibiotic in rabbits. No studies using the human equivalent dose was executed in monkeys. All 
antibiotic studies were unblinded and some of them lacked GLP-status. In study AR034 where the 
concomitant treatment of ETI-204 and antibiotic was administered IV 30 hours post exposure, the 
animals were highly sensitive to monotherapy of a human equivalent dose of levofloxacin which 
resulted in a 100% survival rate. If the treatment, (1045 and 1030) was delayed 72 – 96 hours, the 
efficacy of levofloxacin was lower whereas the number of animals surviving the antibiotic treatment 
was markedly reduced (28% survived when treatment was delayed to 96 hours). However, a high 
number of animals died before treatment was initiated. Only one out of four combination studies 
(AR007, ETI-204 4 mg/kg, IV) showed a statistically significant effect of ETI-204 (non-commercial 
formulation) concomitantly administered with human equivalent dose of levofloxacin compared to 
levofloxacin alone. In this study the survival rate with levofloxacin alone was low, 33%, however, the 
rabbits were dosed for 5 days with levofloxacin administered orally with an early treatment onset at 9 
hours post challenge, since the mean day of euthanise after exposure was 14 days it is suggested that 
the levofloxacin animals died after the treatment was stopped.

Supportive studies 
Supportive ETI-204 monotherapy studies in monkeys and rabbits. 
The efficacy of ETI-204 in monotherapy studies for the treatment of inhalational anthrax was examined 
in supportive efficacy studies in cynomolgus monkeys (Studies AP203, AP107, AP107, NIAID 1056 and 
AP307), and in NZW rabbits (Studies AR007, AR004, AR012, AR021, AR034, AR035, AR037, AR0315, 
NIAID 1030 and NIAID 1045)). In these studies, NZW rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys were exposed 
to a target dose of 200 LD50 equivalents of B. anthracis (Ames) spores via inhalation and then were 
treated with a single IV or IM dose of ETI-204 at time ranging from 9 to 48 hours following spore 
challenge.

Results [Supportive ETI-204 monotherapy studies in monkeys and rabbits] 
In rabbits and monkeys, ETI-204 increased survival when administered either IV or IM following 
exposure to B. anthracis spores. The survival benefit was time dependent with statistically significantly 
higher survival observed with earlier treatment after spore exposure (≤ 24 hrs) (see table below).

Supportive ETI-204 studies in combination with antibiotics (low dose) 
Four studies of ETI-204 in combination with antibiotics lower than the human equivalent dose were 
conducted in either the NZW rabbit or cynomolgus monkey model of inhalational anthrax. These 
studies were open-label (unblinded) trials that may lack GLP-compliance. An overview of the 
performed ETI-204 studies with concomitant administration of antibiotics is provided in the table 
below.

Results – [ETI-204 in combination with antibiotics (low dose) for the treatment of 
inhalational anthrax]  
The results (survival rates) from the studies where concomitant administration of antibiotics and ETI-
204 were conducted with a less than human equivalent antibiotic dose (i.e., yields lower exposure to 
that achieved by the recommended doses in humans) and ETI-204 doses from 8 to 16 mg/kg are 
presented in the table below. The antibiotics used in those studies were either levofloxacin, 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline.

Other supportive studies 
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Studies 
The efficacy of ETI-204 monotherapy for the pre-exposure prevention of inhalational anthrax was 
evaluated in three studies: AR001 and AR003 in NZW rabbits, and AP305 in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Two routes of ETI-204 administration were examined: IV and IM. 
In cynomolgus monkeys, a 16 mg/kg IM dose administered 24-72 hours before spore exposure 
statistically significantly increased survival rate and survival time and prevented the development of 
bacteraemia for 56 days after spore challenge. All monkeys administered a single dose of 16 mg/kg 
IM ETI-204 at 24, 48, and 72 hours before spore exposure survived compared to 10% survival in 
placebo-treated animals. In NZW rabbits, 4 mg/kg IV and 8 mg/kg IM administered 30-45 minutes 
before spore exposure also statistically significantly increased survival rates and survival time 
compared to placebo and prevented the development of bacteraemia for 28 days after spore 
challenge. 
The applicant concluded that ETI-204 prevents the development of inhalational anthrax when 
administered as pre-exposure prophylaxis to animals that were subsequently exposed to a high 
inoculum of B. anthracis spores. Since pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment is out of scope for the 
present application, these studies are not assessed herein. 
Re-challenge Study 
An anthrax re-challenge study was conducted to provide evidence that a single IV dose of ETI-204, 
either as monotherapy or in combination with multiple doses of an antibiotic, did not interfere with the 
development of protective endogenous immunity to PA. This study included two phases: Phase 1 and 
Phase 2. Results from Phase 1 are relevant to the treatment of inhalational anthrax in combination 
with an antibiotic and results from Phase 2 are relevant to generation of a protective endogenous 
immune response to PA. 
ETI-204 administered either alone or in combination with levofloxacin following a primary challenge 
with B. anthracis spores does not interfere with the development of protective endogenous immunity 
as shown by increased survival and the prevention of inhalational anthrax in the absence of treatment 
following a secondary B. anthracis spore challenge in AR034.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy is bridged from data obtained in the animal disease model, via healthy animals to humans 
based on similar or higher exposure in humans. Since PK data are generated in healthy humans, the 
impact of physiological consequences of disease, as well as target mediated clearance, remains an 
uncertainty. 
The selected animal models including NZW rabbits and non-human primates are considered acceptable 
models of inhalational anthrax and are widely used for assessing the efficacy of anthrax 
countermeasures such as vaccines and antibodies. The artificial nature of the model is recognised, 
e.g., in terms of a standardised inoculum as well as different disease kinetics compared to the human 
situation. A residual uncertainty is how time of treatment initiation in relation to infection and initiation 
of symptoms impacts efficacy in humans, especially since the disease progression is more rapid in 
herbivores such as rabbit. 
Four monotherapy efficacy studies were GLP-compliant and blinded (AP204, AP202, AP301 and 
AR033). These are considered pivotal for the efficacy demonstration. In addition, two earlier studies 
investigating other dose levels (AP201 and AP203), are considered supportive. 
Monotherapy efficacy studies of obiltoxaximab 
The activity of obiltoxaximab in neutralizing the anthrax toxin was evaluated in four pivotal 
monotherapy studies. In study AR033 a statistically significant difference in survival rate compared to 
placebo was observed when 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg was administered IV with a numerical survival rate of 
33-69%. In the three studies including monkeys, high survival rate (83-100%) was observed in study 
AP301 when obiltoxaximab was administered IM at the doses 8 or 16 mg/kg up to 24 h post exposure, 
however no difference was seen when the treatment was initiated 36 h post exposure. In study AP204 
a statistically significant difference in survival rate was observed between placebo (6%) and 16 mg/kg 
IV administered ETI-204 (47%), however no difference was seen between placebo (6%) and 4 mg/kg 
IV administered ETI-204 (25%).  
In study AP202 a statistically significant difference in survival rate compared to placebo (0%) was 
observed for 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab (two formulations; pilot and commercial) administered IV, the 
survival rate was however modest (31-35%). Despite the inclusion of two formulations, the study 
cannot be used to demonstrate comparability between the two formulations since in-vivo models would 
not provide sufficient sensitivity and power for that purpose. However, efficacy studies including both 
the commercial formulation and the investigational formulation are acceptable given that comparability 
has been demonstrated. 
It can be concluded that the provided data from the main monotherapy studies are sufficient to 
support proof of concept for obiltoxaximab, since a substantially higher survival rate in general was 
observed compared to placebo in both monkey and rabbit, when treatment was initiated based on 
clinical symptoms or PA antigen levels. In addition, the secondary efficacy endpoint, survival time from 
spore challenge, was increased in ETI-204 treated animals in the four main studies.  
It was noted that the response rate was time dependent, where the earlier the treatment was initiated 
the higher the survival rate. Furthermore, a lower bacterial count was associated with a higher survival 
rate. This suggests that, as would be anticipated, the magnitude of efficacy will depend on the time 
from infection or onset of symptoms and treatment initiation. 
The results from the supportive monotherapy studies with obiltoxaximab show that, in general, a dose 
of 16 mg/kg was active in the treatment of inhalation anthrax in both monkeys and rabbits after IV 
and IM administration of obiltoxaximab up to 24 hrs post-challenge. Thus, the data from these 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 91/113 
 
 
  
 
 
exploratory studies are relevant as they show an increased survival rate similar to the blinded and GLP 
compliant proof-of-concept studies for obiltoxaximab in monotherapy. 
The SmPC section 5.1 includes data from the blinded and GLP compliant monotherapy treatment 
studies (AR033, AP301, AP202 and AP204). The applicant had submitted data supporting that the 
blinded to group design for study AP204 did not impact the survival rate of the control group. It was 
therefore considered acceptable to include results from study AP204 in SmPC section 5.1. It has been 
made clear in the SmPC that this study was blinded by group. Study AP203 is not described in the 
SmPC as it did not investigate the 16 mg/kg dose level. 
Concomitant use of obiltoxaximab and antibiotics 
No add-on benefit of obiltoxaximab was demonstrated in the studies where human equivalent doses of 
antibiotic were administered to rabbits. None of the studies using the human equivalent dose was 
executed in monkeys. All antibiotic studies were unblinded and some of them lacked GLP-status. In 
study AR034 where the concomitant treatment of obiltoxaximab (commercial batch) and antibiotic was 
administered IV 30 hours post exposure, the infection was highly sensitive to monotherapy levofloxacin 
administered as a human equivalent dose which resulted in a 100% survival rate. If the treatment, 
(1045 and 1030) was delayed 72 – 96 hours, the efficacy of levofloxacin was lower whereas the 
number of animals surviving the antibiotic treatment was markedly reduced (28% survived when 
treatment was delayed to 96 hours). Since a high number of animals died before treatment was 
initiated the results must be interpreted with caution. Only one of the four combination studies 
(AR007, ETI-204 4 mg/kg, IV) showed a statistically significant effect of obiltoxaximab (pilot batch) 
concomitantly administered with human equivalent dose of levofloxacin compared to levofloxacin 
alone. In this study the survival rate with levofloxacin alone was low (33%). However, the rabbits were 
dosed for 5 days with levofloxacin administered orally with an early treatment onset at 9 hours post 
challenge and since the mean day of euthanise after exposure was approximately 14 days, it is 
suggested that the levofloxacin animals died after the treatment of levofloxacin was stopped. 
It appears that the combination studies were not sensitive to demonstrate potential additive or 
synergistic effects of obiltoxaximab and antibiotics. Due to the rapid progress of anthrax disease in 
herbivores such as rabbit, a large number of animals died before treatment was initiated and no clear 
results were provided from those studies.  
It is recognised that obiltoxaximab will be administered to patients in combination with antibiotics. 
Still, given the high lethality of inhalational anthrax once symptoms have occurred, it does not appear 
that a demonstration of additive effects in combination is necessary, as it would be reasonable to add 
an intervention with a different mechanism of action to antibiotics, provided that there is reasonable 
evidence of the efficacy of that intervention. Duly recognising the limitations of an efficacy 
demonstration based on animal models, it is considered that the efficacy of obiltoxaximab has been 
sufficiently substantiated, given the limitations of possible studies. 
While the precise time-window after infection or onset of symptoms where obiltoxaximab therapy is 
beneficial cannot be defined based on the animal models, data support the anticipation that efficacy 
will be greater the earlier therapy is initiated. Therefore, the prophylaxis indication for the rare patient 
that is not eligible for antibiotics is considered supported by the data from the monotherapy studies. 
The conclusions above are contingent on the clarification that exposure in humans is therefore likely to 
be sufficient.

Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
It is not feasible to evaluate efficacy of medical countermeasures against inhalational anthrax in clinical 
studies, because the incidence of naturally occurring disease is too low, and it is unethical to 
intentionally expose humans to anthrax.   
An open-label field study AH501, which is also part of the agreed PIP for Obiltoxaximab SFL, is planned 
to be conducted upon the occurrence of an anthrax outbreak in a country where obiltoxaximab is 
authorised and available. To gather as much data on the efficacy (and safety) of obiltoxaximab as 
possible, the protocol for study AH501 foresees data collection on any use of obiltoxaximab in the 
approved indication, including use of obiltoxaximab in the context of large and small anthrax incidents, 
including single cases. In addition, the protocol for study AH501 allows for retrospective data 
collection. 
The primary objective of study AH501 is to evaluate the clinical response, including the course of 
illness and survival in subjects with suspected, probable, or confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax 
treated with obiltoxaximab. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Proof-of-concept is considered reasonably established for obiltoxaximab in monotherapy studies for the 
treatment of inhalational anthrax. An add-on benefit of administering obiltoxaximab in concomitant use 
with antibiotics has not been demonstrated in the provided studies. However, it would be logical to add 
an intervention with a different mechanism of action to antibiotics, since there is reasonable evidence 
of efficacy in terms of survival rate for obiltoxaximab administered as monotherapy. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
A post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES), i.e. the phase 4 open-label field study AH501 is to be 
conducted upon an anthrax outbreak in a country where obiltoxaximab is authorised and available 
(study protocol to be re-submitted for assessment by 1Q2021). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Exposure 
The Primary Safety Population includes pooled safety data from subjects who received a single IV dose 
of 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab (commercial formulation) or placebo in AH104 and subjects who received a 
single IV dose of 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab either with or without ciprofloxacin in AH110. In addition, 
repeat dose date from subjects who received a repeat-dose of 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab (commercial 
formulation) in Study AH109 either within 2 weeks or ≥4 months after the first dose are included in 
the Primary Safety Population. 
Supportive data include the Expanded Safety Population which includes pooled data for all subjects 
who received a single IV dose of 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab (either the commercial formulation or the 
investigational material) or placebo in AH104, AH110, and AH105. Further data from subjects who 
received other IV ETI-204 obiltoxaximab doses in study AH105, AH102, and AH101 are also considered 
supportive.  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 93/113 
 
 
  
 
 
Overall, 497 healthy adults received obiltoxaximab (all doses; both commercial formulation and 
investigational material; both IV and IM routes of administration; of these 250 healthy subjects (single 
dose pool study AH104 and AH110) were treated with a single 16 mg/kg dose of the commercial 
obiltoxaximab formulation. 
Adverse events 
In the single-dose pool of the Primary Safety Population, 46.0% and 38.6% of subjects in the 
obiltoxaximab and placebo groups, respectively, had at least one AE. The majority of the AEs in the 
single-dose were mild or moderate. Two severe AEs, urticaria and pruritus, were reported in 1 subject.  
The most frequent AEs (reported in >2% of subjects) in the obiltoxaximab group were headache, 
upper respiratory tract infection, somnolence, pruritus, vessel puncture site bruise, cough, nausea, and 
urticaria. Out of these AEs, the rates of headache, somnolence, pruritus, cough, and urticaria were 
≥2% higher in the obiltoxaximab group compared to the placebo group. 
In the single-dose pool, 14.4% and 12.9% of subjects in the obiltoxaximab and placebo groups, 
respectively, had an AE that was judged by the investigator as related to study drug. Related AEs that 
occurred in ≥1% of subjects in the obiltoxaximab group were pruritus, headache, urticaria, rash, and 
cough and infusion site pain. 
In the repeat-dose groups, 34.3% and 25.7% of subjects in the 2 weeks apart and ≥4 months apart 
groups, respectively, had an AE that was judged by the investigator as related to study drug. The most 
frequently reported related AEs in the 2 weeks and ≥4 months apart repeat-dose groups were infusion 
site swelling (8.6% and 11.4%, respectively), infusion site erythema (8.6% and 2.9%, respectively), 
and infusion site pain (5.7% and 2.9%, respectively). The majority of AEs were mild and moderate.  
Four subjects in the repeat-dose groups had severe AEs, including 1 subject in the 2 weeks apart and 3 
subjects in the ≥4 months apart groups. One of these AEs (back pain occurred in conjunction with mild 
to moderate flushing, chills, dyspnoea, cyanosis, pallor, rash, restlessness, and myalgia) was rated 
related to study drug by the investigator.  
In the single-dose pool of the Expanded Safety Population, 47.9% and 46.6% of subjects in the 
obiltoxaximab and placebo groups, respectively, had at least one AE; one subject in the obiltoxaximab 
group permanently discontinued study drug due to an AE. 
Frequent AEs that occurred in a higher percentage (≥2% difference) of subjects in the obiltoxaximab 
group compared to the placebo group were headache (obiltoxaximab , 9.2%; placebo, 5.7%), 
somnolence (obiltoxaximab, 4.4%; placebo, no subjects), pruritus (obiltoxaximab, 4.0%; placebo, 
1.4%), cough (obiltoxaximab, 2.8%; placebo, no subjects), and urticaria (obiltoxaximab , 2.4%; 
placebo, no subjects).  
•  Events of special interest (most salient findings) 
Events of interest for obiltoxaximab were defined by the applicant based on the known safety profile 
for mAbs, non-clinical data with obiltoxaximab and published data with an anti-PA mAb. They include 
infusion-related reactions (defined as AEs occurring within 24 hours of the start of study drug 
infusion), hypersensitivity (including rash), rash, neurologic AEs, gastrointestinal disorders, infections 
and infestations, and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.  
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were defined as any AE timely related to drug administration, i.e. any 
AE occurring within 24 hours of administration of IV obiltoxaximab. The infusion site reactions were 
assessed by the investigator according to a 4-grade scale. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 94/113 
 
 
  
 
 
In the single-dose pool of the Primary Safety Population, 15.6% and 4.3% of subjects in the 
obiltoxaximab and placebo groups had an AE within the first 3 hours of the start of study drug infusion. 
Within 3 to 24 hours of the start of study drug infusion, 13.6% and 7.1% of subjects in the 
obiltoxaximab and placebo groups in the single-dose pool had an AE. The rate of hypersensitivity was 
8.8% (22/250) in the obiltoxaximab group compared to 5.7% (4/70) in the placebo group. The rate of 
rash in the single-dose pool was 5.6% and 2.9% of subjects in the obiltoxaximab and placebo groups, 
respectively. All except two hypersensitivity AEs were mild or moderate in severity (independent of 
pre-treatment with diphenhydramine) One subject not pre-treated with diphenhydramine had severe 
urticaria and severe pruritus reported within 3 hours of the start of the infusion. Both AEs decreased to 
mild in severity at 6 hours post start of infusion. One case of anaphylactic reaction was reported based 
on investigator’s assessment. The subject was pre-treated with diphenhydramine and had an acute 
anaphylactic reaction during the first (and only) obiltoxaximab infusion. This was characterised by 
shortness of breath, coughing and a diffuse, pruritic urticarial rash covering most of the body, including 
neck, chest, back, abdomen, arms, and legs. This event was categorised as moderate in severity and 
non-serious by the investigator.  
The majority of subjects in the obiltoxaximab and placebo groups in the single-dose pool of the 
Primary Safety Population received diphenhydramine pre-treatment before study drug infusion 
(obiltoxaximab, n=184 [73.6%]; placebo, n=48 [68.6%]). In the single-dose pool, the incidence of 
hypersensitivity was slightly higher in subjects who received obiltoxaximab and pre-medication with 
diphenhydramine compared to those who did not (17/184 [9.2%] vs. 5/66 [7.6%], respectively). 
Conversely, the incidence of rash was slightly lower in subjects who received pre-medication with 
diphenhydramine compared to those who did not (10/184 [5.4%] vs. 4/66 [6.1%], respectively). The 
severity of hypersensitivity AEs was similar with and without diphenhydramine pre-treatment. 
In the repeat-dose groups, hypersensitivity (including rash) was only reported following obiltoxaximab 
administration. The percentage of subjects with hypersensitivity (including rash) was 8.6% and 5.9% 
after the first and second doses of obiltoxaximab in the 2 weeks apart repeat-dose group, respectively, 
and 5.7% and 3.2% after the first and second doses of obiltoxaximab in the ≥4 months apart repeat-
dose group, respectively. The percentage of subjects with rash was 2.9% and 5.9% of subjects after 
the first and second doses of obiltoxaximab in the 2 weeks apart repeat-dose group, respectively, and 
2.9% and 3.2% after the first and second doses of obiltoxaximab in the ≥4 months apart repeat-dose 
group, respectively. No hypersensitivity (including rash) or rash AEs occurred in more than 1 subject in 
either of the repeat-dose groups. Thus, repeat-dosing with obiltoxaximab, either 2 weeks apart or ≥4 
months apart, does not appear to be associated with an increase in hypersensitivity (including rash) or 
rash. 
In the single-dose pool of the Expanded Safety Population, AEs within the first 3 hours of the start of 
study drug infusion consistent with a possible hypersensitivity reaction in the obiltoxaximab group 
were identical to those in the Primary Safety Population. Compared to the Primary Safety Population, 
there were 2 additional cases of urticaria in the obiltoxaximab group of the Expanded Safety Population 
within the first 3 hours of the start of study drug infusion.  
Nervous system disorders were reported in 15.2% of subjects in the obiltoxaximab group and 5.7% of 
subjects in the placebo group in the single-dose pool of the Primary Safety Population. The higher 
frequency of nervous system disorders in the obiltoxaximab group compared to the placebo group was 
largely driven by the PTs of headache, somnolence, and dizziness. Other PTs in the nervous system 
disorders SOC were only reported in single subjects without a clear pattern. Headache and somnolence 
were reported for a higher percentage of subjects in the obiltoxaximab group (9.2% and 4.4%, 
respectively) compared to the placebo group (5.7% and 0.0%, respectively). In the repeat-dose group, 
the frequencies of headache and somnolence were identical regardless of whether an obiltoxaximab or 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 95/113 
 
 
  
 
 
a placebo infusion had most recently been administered. Somnolence was only seen in the 
obiltoxaximab group in subjects who were pre-treated with diphenhydramine. 
Psychiatric AEs in the Expanded Safety Pool were consistent with those reported in the Primary Safety 
Pool. 
Headache, somnolence, and dizziness were also the most frequently reported nervous system 
disorders in the repeat dose groups, however the frequencies were similar regardless of whether an 
obiltoxaximab or a placebo infusion had most recently been administered.  
In the single-dose pool, gastrointestinal AEs were reported in 6.4% and 2.9% of subjects in the ETI 
204 and placebo groups, respectively. A subset of gastrointestinal AEs combined (toothache, vomiting, 
dry mouth, anal fissure, eructation, hiatus hernia and lip pain) accounted for a higher incidence of 
gastrointestinal AEs in the obiltoxaximab group compared to the placebo group (11% vs. 0% of 
subjects, respectively).  
In the repeat-dose group, gastrointestinal AEs, including toothache and vomiting, did not occur more 
frequently following obiltoxaximab infusion compared to placebo infusion  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred in the obiltoxaximab clinical development program. 
Three serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the obiltoxaximab clinical development program: 
an ovarian cyst in the placebo group of Study AH104, an ankle fracture in the obiltoxaximab group in 
Study AH109, and a herniated disc in a subject treated with 4 mg/kg obiltoxaximab in Study AH105. 
All of these events were judged as unrelated to study medication by the investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematological parameters were in general similar and stable over time in subjects who received 
single doses of obiltoxaximab or placebo, and in subjects who received repeat doses of obiltoxaximab 
either within 2 weeks or ≥4 months after the first dose.  
For each serum biochemistry parameter, the majority of subjects in the obiltoxaximab and placebo 
groups in the single-dose pool of the Primary Safety Population had a toxicity grade 0 at Baseline and 
no change in toxicity grade post-baseline. Increased cholesterol (obiltoxaximab, 16.9%; placebo, 
18.6%) and increased creatine kinase (obiltoxaximab, 10.0%; placebo, 15.7%) were the most 
frequent ≥2 grade shifts in the obiltoxaximab and placebo groups in the single-dose pool of the 
Primary Safety Population. 
There were no differences between the Expanded and Primary Safety Populations in the most frequent 
≥2-grade shifts in serum biochemistry parameters. 
No subjects in the single-dose pools of the Primary and Expanded Safety Populations met the criteria 
for Hy’s law. 
In the repeat-dose groups, the majority of subjects in the 2 weeks apart and ≥4 months apart groups 
had a toxicity grade 0 at Baseline in each serum biochemistry parameter and no change in toxicity 
grade post-baseline. Increased cholesterol (2 weeks, 25.7%; ≥4 months, 22.9%), increased creatine 
kinase (22.9% in each group), and increased potassium (2 weeks, 2.9%; ≥4 months, 20.0%) were the 
most frequent ≥2-grade shifts in the repeat dose groups  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 96/113 
 
 
  
 
 
Vital signs, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oral body 
temperature were similar and stable over time in subjects who received single doses of ETI-204 or 
placebo and in subjects who received repeat doses of obiltoxaximab either within 2 weeks or ≥4 
months after the first dose.  
Mean values for ECG parameters were stable over time and were similar for subjects who received 
single doses of obiltoxaximab and placebo and in subjects who received repeat doses of obiltoxaximab 
either within 2 weeks or ≥4 months after the first dose. QT prolongation was not seen with either 
single or repeat doses 
Safety in special populations 
Obiltoxaximab has not been evaluated in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or paediatric subjects. 
Clinical studies did not include a sufficient number of subjects ≥65 years to determine if the safety 
profile of obiltoxaximab is different from that seen in younger subjects. 
Although the following subgroup analyses of AEs were performed for the Primary and Expanded Safety 
Populations and the repeat-dose groups: gender (males and females), race (white vs all other races), 
age (≤ 65 years and > 65 years), baseline BMI (<median and ≥median for each pool), baseline CrCl of 
< 102 mL/min, ≥ 102 and ≤ 144 mL/min, and > 144 mL/min (based on quartiles) and, 
diphenhydramine pre-treatment (yes or no) 
In the single-dose pool of the Primary Safety Population the incidence of moderate and severe AEs, 
SAEs, and AEs resulting in study discontinuation were low precluding any meaningful conclusions about 
the potential differences for these events between subgroups. The limited number of additional 
subjects (30 subjects) in the single-dose pool of the Expanded Safety Population compared to the 
Primary Safety Population and in each of the repeat-dose groups (35 subjects each) precludes any 
meaningful conclusions about potential differences in AEs between subgroups in the Expanded Safety 
Population and the repeat-dose groups. 
Immunological events 
Of the 470 subjects who received at least one dose of IV obiltoxaximab in the clinical development 
program, 14 subjects (3%) developed treatment-emergent ADA. Titres ranged from 1:20 to 1:320. In 
the single-dose pool, 2.5% (8/320) of subjects who received one dose of IV obiltoxaximab were 
positive for a treatment-emergent ADA response with titres ranging from 1:20 to 1:320. 
In the repeat-dose groups, 8.8% of subjects who received obiltoxaximab doses 2 weeks apart, and 
3.2% who received doses ≥4 months apart were positive for a treatment-emergent ADA response. 
Titres were quantitatively low, ranging from 1:20 to 1:80. No ADA responses were seen with IM 
administration of obiltoxaximab. 
No AEs were reported coincident with the development of ATA in any of these subjects. The presence 
of ADA did not appear to affect obiltoxaximab disposition (see pharmacology). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
•  Obiltoxaximab in combination with ciprofloxacin  
Part 2 of study AH101 evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of a single dose of 114 mg 
obiltoxaximab IV or placebo administered on Day 1 plus ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours orally 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 97/113 
 
 
  
 
 
for 14 days). Six subjects received obiltoxaximab in combination with ciprofloxacin and 6 subjects 
received placebo in combination with ciprofloxacin.  
AEs were reported by 100% of subjects in the obiltoxaximab plus ciprofloxacin group and 66.7% of 
subjects in the ciprofloxacin alone group. The most frequently reported AEs were headache 
(obiltoxaximab + ciprofloxacin, 66.7%; ciprofloxacin, 33.3%), nausea (obiltoxaximab + ciprofloxacin, 
33.3%; ciprofloxacin, 16.7%) and vomiting (obiltoxaximab + ciprofloxacin, 33.3%; ciprofloxacin, 
16.7%).  
AH110 was an open-label, randomised, parallel group study of IV obiltoxaximab administered alone on 
Day 1 and in the presence of IV ciprofloxacin (400 mg on Day 1; following obiltoxaximab infusion) and 
oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg orally every 12 hours on Days 2 through 8 and a single 750 mg dose of oral 
ciprofloxacin on the morning of Day 9). The percentage of subjects with AEs was similar in the 
obiltoxaximab plus ciprofloxacin and obiltoxaximab alone groups. Somnolence (obiltoxaximab + 
ciprofloxacin, 25.0%; ETI 204 alone, 30.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection (obiltoxaximab + 
ciprofloxacin, 10.0%; obiltoxaximab alone, 25.0%) were the most frequently reported AEs. 
Three severe AEs occurred in Part 2 of AH101: dizziness and upper respiratory tract infection in 1 
subject in the ciprofloxacin alone group and nausea in 1 subject in the obiltoxaximab plus ciprofloxacin 
group. No severe AEs were reported in AH110. 
Two subjects in the obiltoxaximab plus ciprofloxacin group in AH110 permanently discontinued study 
drug before completing the obiltoxaximab infusion due to AEs of urticaria. No premature 
discontinuations of study drug due to an AE occurred in Part 2 of AH101.  
•  Obiltoxaximab in combination with anthrax vaccine 
No studies have been conducted with obiltoxaximab to evaluate the effect of concomitant 
administration with an anthrax vaccine. 
•  Diphenhydramine pre-treatment 
The majority of subjects in the obiltoxaximab and placebo groups in the single-dose pool of the 
Primary Safety Population received diphenhydramine pre-treatment before study drug infusion 
(obiltoxaximab 73.6%; placebo, 68.6%). The percentage of subjects who did not receive 
diphenhydramine pre-treatment before study drug infusion was 26.4% in the obiltoxaximab group and 
31.4% in the placebo group. 
All subjects in study AH110 were pre-treated with antihistamine (i.e. diphenhydramine), whereas 63 
subjects in study AH104 and 8 subjects in study AH109 did not receive the pre-treatment. Overall, a 
slightly higher frequency of AEs was observed in subjects that were not pre-treated with 
diphenhydramine in the SOC general disorders and administration site conditions (10.6% vs 17.6%) 
and in the SOC nervous system disorders (15% vs 21.6%).  
In the obiltoxaximab group, subjects who were pre-treated with diphenhydramine prior to the infusion 
of study drug had a lower overall incidence of AEs than subjects without diphenhydramine pre-
treatment (43.5% and 53.0%, respectively). In the placebo group, the overall incidence of AEs was 
similar with and without diphenhydramine pre-treatment (37.5% and 40.9%, respectively). AEs in the 
obiltoxaximab group that were decreased with diphenhydramine pre-treatment compared to without 
pre-treatment included headache (6.0% and 18.2%, respectively) and cough (1.1% and 7.6%, 
respectively). 
AEs that were increased in the obiltoxaximab group with diphenhydramine pre-treatment compared to 
without pre-treatment included somnolence (6.0% and no subjects, respectively ;), vessel puncture 
site bruise (3.8% and 1.5%, respectively), and nausea (3.8% and no subjects, respectively).  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 98/113 
 
 
  
 
 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the 320 subjects who received a single dose of obiltoxaximab in either the single-dose or the 
repeat-dose groups, 8 subjects (2.5%) permanently discontinued study drug before infusion 
completion because of one or more AEs.  
All 8 subjects who permanently discontinued the obiltoxaximab infusion before completion experienced 
a possible hypersensitivity reaction, including 5 subjects with urticaria (mild to severe) (3 of these 
subjects had concomitant pruritus [mild to severe]), 2 subjects with rash (moderate), and 1 subject 
with an anaphylactic reaction (moderate). The subject who discontinued obiltoxaximab due to severe 
urticaria and pruritus did not receive diphenhydramine pre-medication. 
In study AH104, a slightly higher frequency of discontinuation was observed among the non-pre-
treated subjects (4.5%) vs the pre-treated subjects (2.1%). 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, obiltoxaximab dose of 16 mg/kg is well-tolerated when administered IV as a 90-minute 
infusion. The AEs were usually mild and moderate. Infusion related reactions including hypersensitivity 
were frequently reported in subjects treated with obiltoxaximab. The data suggest that 
diphenhydramine pre-treatment did not mitigate the infusion related reactions; however, the database 
is too small to draw a robust conclusion. 
Obiltoxaximab has been evaluated only in healthy adult volunteers, however it was not evaluated in 
the target population i.e. patients with inhalation anthrax or in healthy people exposed to anthrax 
spores. There is a theoretical risk that the safety profile of obiltoxaximab could be different in the 
target population. However, since obiltoxaximab does not have an endogenous human target and does 
not exhibit unspecific cross-reactivity in human tissues, the theoretical risk of target-mediated toxicity 
is not a concern for obiltoxaximab treatment. Further, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) via its Fc region is a theoretical concern of IgG1 
antibodies such as obiltoxaximab. Fc-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDC) requires antibody binding to 
antigens on the cell surface; since obiltoxaximab only binds to soluble PA and does not bind to cell 
bound PA, thus Fc-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDC) is not a concern for obiltoxaximab treatment 
in the sought indication. 
Patients with comorbidities such as hepatic impairment, renal impairment or with cardiovascular 
impairment were not included in the development program. Considering the mode of action of 
obiltoxaximab i.e. the ligand is a non-human target, drug-disease interactions are not expected 
therefore it is not expected that acute and/ or active medical conditions will have clinically meaningful 
effects on safety and efficacy of obiltoxaximab. 
Obiltoxaximab has not been evaluated in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or paediatric subjects. 
The frequency of AEs such as infusion related reactions, might be influenced by age-related factors, 
concomitant diseases, concurrent medications, however, clinical studies did not include a sufficient 
number of subjects ≥65 years to determine if the safety profile of obiltoxaximab is different from that 
seen in younger subjects. Thus, no safety data in vulnerable population are available are available, 
however due to the nature of the disease to be treated / prevented this shortcoming is acceptable.  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 99/113 
 
 
  
 
 
A limited number of subjects received obiltoxaximab in combination with ciprofloxacin; a slightly 
increase in AEs were reported in the obiltoxaximab + ciprofloxacin groups compared to ciprofloxacin 
alone. However, the data have to be interpreted with caution due to the small study population. 
Additional measures are necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a under 
exceptional circumstances (see below) 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
An open-label field study AH501, which is also part of the agreed PIP for Obiltoxaximab SFL, is planned 
to be conducted upon the occurrence of an anthrax outbreak in a country where obiltoxaximab is 
authorised and available. To gather as much data on the (efficacy and) safety of obiltoxaximab as 
possible, the protocol for study AH501 foresees data collection on any use of obiltoxaximab in the 
approved indication, including use of obiltoxaximab in the context of large and small anthrax incidents, 
including single cases. In addition, the protocol for study AH501 allows for retrospective data 
collection.  
The study population may include men and women (including pregnant and lactating women) and 
children of all ages who received obiltoxaximab as part of their clinical care for anthrax infection 
The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of obiltoxaximab in subjects with suspected, 
probable, or confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax. Safety evaluations will include TEAEs and SAEs 
during the study, including infusion and hypersensitivity reactions, vital signs and physical findings, as 
well as ECG and clinical laboratory tests. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data of obiltoxaximab show an acceptable safety profile in healthy young adults. The 
exclusion of vulnerable population in the phase I study program is acceptable. Due to the epidemiology 
of the disease i.e. very rare incidence of natural inhalation anthrax the generation safety data in the 
target population for obiltoxaximab i.e. general population including vulnerable population is not 
feasible at the moment and will be subject to a Post-Marketing Study.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
A post-authorisation study, i.e. the phase 4 open-label field study AH501 is to be conducted upon an 
anthrax outbreak in a country where obiltoxaximab is authorised and available (study protocol to be 
re-submitted for assessment by 1Q2021).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.03.2016. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that obiltoxaximab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The review of data on the quality, non-clinical and clinical properties of the active substance, indicates 
that the mAb obiltoxaximab in comparison to the known approved mAbs and to other potential 
treatment options (antibiotics, anthrax vaccines, anthrax immunoglobulins is to be qualified as a new 
active substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and efficacy from the 
previously authorised substance. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 101/113 
 
 
  
 
 
Raxibacumab, another mAb with the same mechanism of action as ETI-204 (B. anthracis protective-
antigen binding and neutralisation) is not authorised in the EU but was granted orphan drug 
designation (ODD) by the European Commission in 2014. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers obiltoxaximab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The Group accepted an English only vial label with a bi-lingual outer carton (EN-DE), including some 
text simplifications. 
Furthermore, the Group agreed with the applicant’s request for an English-only package leaflet with 
the commitment for the applicant to provide patients with a printed version in local language(s). The 
labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
statutory information in all EU languages has been submitted by the applicant and has been found 
acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: The outer carton (inner 
flap) and on the package leaflet. 
2.10.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Obiltoxaximab SFL (obiltoxaximab) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and also since it is approved 
under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8), DIR Art (22)].  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The following indication is claimed for obiltoxaximab: 
• 
Obiltoxaximab SFL is indicated in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs in all age 
groups for treatment of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. 
• 
Obiltoxaximab SFL is indicated in all age groups for post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational 
anthrax when alternative therapies are not appropriate or are not available. 
Anthrax is a disease caused by the Gram-positive, encapsulated, spore-forming bacterium B. anthracis, 
which is found in soils all over the world. Inhalational anthrax, the most severe form of anthrax, is 
caused by exposure to aerosolised B. anthracis spores. 
Inhalational anthrax is a life-threatening disease, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 50% 
even with aggressive treatment including multiple antimicrobials. Patients who progress to the 
fulminant stage of inhalational anthrax have an extreme high mortality rate (~97 %), regardless of the 
treatment they receive. 
Although, naturally occurring inhalational anthrax is a rare condition, occurring sporadically around the 
world in individuals and small clusters of people exposed to infected animals and animal products, 
anthrax spores have been used in the past and have the potential to be used in the future as biological 
weapons. B. anthracis spores are readily weaponised and highly virulent. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, the main treatment for suspected or confirmed inhalational anthrax is antibiotic therapy. 
Antibiotics are also recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals with suspected or 
confirmed exposure to B. anthracis. In some cases, immunisation with anthrax vaccines is 
recommended, and this may reduce the duration of post-exposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment. 
  Ciprofloxacin is licensed for post-exposure prophylaxis and curative treatment of inhalational 
anthrax in children, adolescents and adults. Oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid (or 10-15 mg/kg in 
children) for 60 days is recommended to prevent inhalational anthrax in humans, starting as 
soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure. At least 60 days of prophylaxis after 
exposure to B. anthracis spores is recommended because the spores can potentially remain 
dormant for up to 60 days before they are activated. For treatment of inhalational anthrax, it is 
recommended that the treating physician refer to national and /or international consensus 
documents. 
  Levofloxacin is licensed for post-exposure prophylaxis and curative treatment of inhalational 
anthrax, based on in-vitro susceptibility and animal data, together with limited human data. 
Dosing recommendations are similar, including reference to national and /or international 
consensus documents for the treatment of inhalational anthrax.  
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 103/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  Benzylpenicillin is licensed for the treatment of B. anthracis infections but no specific 
recommendations are made in the SmPC. 
The main treatment for suspected or confirmed inhalational anthrax in the EU is fluoroquinolone 
therapy. Ciprofloxacin is recommended as a first line treatment of inhalational anthrax in all age 
groups [EMA, 2014], and as an alternative for oral follow-up. In addition, the EMA recommends 
ciprofloxacin as a first line prophylaxis until susceptibility to other agents has been confirmed. Other 
quinolones (ofloxacin and levofloxacin) can be used as alternative treatment options but dose 
recommendations are only available for adults. Doxycycline and penicillin provide treatment options 
when susceptibility has been confirmed although penicillin is not bactericidal against B. anthracis. 
Natural resistance of B. anthracis is known for several antibiotics, including sulfamethoxazole, 
trimethoprim, cefuroxime, cefotaxime sodium, aztreonam, and ceftazidime. They should not be used 
for treatment or prophylaxis of anthrax infection [Inglesby et al, 2002]. 
Two additional approaches for treatment of inhalational anthrax are currently not authorised in the EU: 
passive immunisation with anthrax immunoglobulins, and antitoxin therapy with mAbs targeting 
anthrax toxins. 
The possible exposure of large numbers of people to air-borne B. anthracis spores in the context of a 
bioterrorist attack raises many issues, not least the availability of antibiotics, compliance of long-term 
antibiotic administration, safety profile of the antibiotics or resistance development. It is noted that 
since March 2019 the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics is restricted in the EU (EMA/175398/2019) due 
to safety concerns related to disabling and potentially permanent side effects involving tendons, 
muscles, joints and the nervous system. Special caution is warranted in elderly patients, patients with 
kidney disease and those who have had organ transplantation because these patients are at a higher 
risk of tendon injury. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
It is not feasible to evaluate efficacy of medical countermeasures against inhalational anthrax in clinical 
studies, because the incidence of naturally occurring disease is too low, and it is unethical to 
intentionally expose humans to anthrax. The applicant is requesting an authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances, since human efficacy studies are not possible. Therefore, it is considered acceptable to 
evaluate efficacy in animal trials. Efficacy studies in treatment and the pre- and post-exposure 
prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax were conducted in two well-characterised animal models, NZW 
rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. 
Four monotherapy treatment studies are GLP-compliant as well as blinded (AP204, AP202, AP301 and 
AR033). These are considered pivotal for the efficacy demonstration. In those studies, obiltoxaximab 
was administered IV or IM to rabbits or monkeys that were exhibiting clinical signs or symptoms of 
systemic anthrax. The evaluated doses were 0, 1, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg IV (rabbit) and 0, 4, 8 and 16 
mg/kg, IV or IM (monkey). Two different formulations of obiltoxaximab were used (pilot and 
commercial). In two monkey studies (AP202 and AP301) animals were treated with the commercial 
formulation whereas obiltoxaximab in the pilot formulation was administered in rabbits (AR033) as well 
as in monkeys (Studies AP204 and AP202).  
Other monotherapy studies were also provided, however, since investigated other doses than 
16 mg/kg, they were unblinded or without GLP-status, they are considered supportive. 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 104/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Furthermore, four studies of obiltoxaximab as concomitant treatment with antibiotics were conducted 
in the NZW rabbit model of inhalational anthrax, using human equivalent doses of levofloxacin 
administered orally for 3-5 days. These studies were open-label (unblinded) exploratory trials, and 
only one of them was conducted in compliance with GLP (AR007). Obiltoxaximab at the doses of 4, 8 
and 16 mg/kg were administered IV concomitant with antibiotics 9-96 hours post exposure. In the 
studies where treatment was delayed up to 72-96 h post-exposure, several animals died before 
receiving treatment.  
Four studies including monkey and rabbit using significant lower doses of antibiotic were also provided, 
they were considered exploratory and not relevant to demonstrate an add-on benefit of obiltoxaximab. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Four studies were considered as pivotal efficacy monotherapy studies since they were blinded and GLP-
compliant. Of these, Study AP204 was only blinded to group but the applicant showed that this did not 
have any impact on the outcome of the study and this study is therefore considered as pivotal. 
In study AR033 including rabbit a statistically significant difference in survival rate (primary endpoint) 
compared to placebo (0%) was observed when 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg was administered IV with a 
numerical survival rate of 33-69%.  
In the monkey studies, high survival rate (83-100%) compared to placebo (0%) was observed in study 
AP301 when obiltoxaximab was administered IM at the doses 8 or 16 mg/kg up to 24 h post exposure, 
however no difference was seen when the treatment was initiated 36 h post exposure. In study AP204 
a statistically significant difference in survival rate was observed between placebo (6%) and 16 mg/kg 
IV administered ETI-204 (47%), however no difference was seen between placebo (6%) and 4 mg/kg 
IV administered ETI-204 (25%). In study AP202 a statistically significant difference in survival rate 
compared to placebo (0%) was observed for 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab (two formulations; pilot and 
commercial) administered IV, the survival rate was however modest (31-35%). Moreover, survival 
time from spore challenge (secondary endpoint), was increased for all obiltoxaximab treated animals 
included in the four pivotal studies.  
In addition, the efficacy of obiltoxaximab is supported by several non-blinded, non-GLP compliant 
studies, executed in both rabbit and monkey. 
In the exploratory studies in anthrax-challenged animals, treatment with antibiotic plus obiltoxaximab 
increased survival rate compared to placebo. 
Treatment with obiltoxaximab did not prevent the development of a protective anti-PA immune 
response. Rabbits that survived an anthrax-challenge upon treatment with obiltoxaximab alone or in 
combination with antibiotics, developed anti-PA antibodies and showed an increased survival upon re-
challenge 9 months later. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The rabbit and non-human primate models used are considered acceptable models of inhalational 
anthrax, although the artificial nature of the model is recognised, e.g., in terms of a standardised 
inoculum as well as different disease kinetics compared to the human situation. Therefore, it remains 
uncertain what would be the time-window from infection or onset of symptoms, where obiltoxaximab 
would be effective. Furthermore, it is not known what level of bacteraemia that may occur in humans 
infected with inhalation anthrax since infectious dose and time from exposure will be different from 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 105/113 
 
 
  
 
 
case to case, which adds a further uncertainty to the anticipated extent of benefit and how long time 
after exposure the treatment will be effective. 
Most of the efficacy studies were exploratory studies and a limited number of the monotherapy studies 
were GLP-compliant and blinded (four pivotal studies). Two monotherapy studies (AP201 and AP204) 
included in the exposure response modelling were only partly blinded (i.e. by group). The applicant 
was asked to clarify whether these limitations have affected the outcome of the studies and thereby 
their reliability to be included in dose evaluation models. According to the applicant's response, the 
survival in the control groups across the performed studies in monkey was consistent with expected 
survival in untreated animals based on published literature and natural history studies. The blinding 
schema did not appear to impact the overall survival outcomes for the control group. Thus, the 
inclusion of all four monkey studies (AP201, AP204, AP203 and AP202) in the PK modelling appears 
acceptable. 
The effectiveness of the human dose is not verified in patients. Efficacy is bridged from the data 
obtained in the animal disease model, via healthy animals to humans based on similar or higher 
exposure in humans. Since PK data are generated in healthy humans, the impact of physiological 
consequences of disease, as well as target mediated clearance, remains an uncertainty.  
PK data are critical in terms of supporting that the proposed human dose is adequate, i.e. that the 
exposure in humans after administration of a 16 mg/kg dose is not lower than the exposure in 
primates dosed at 16 mg/kg. Taking into account the applicant’s arguments, the dose in human is 
considered sufficiently characterised. 
No add-on benefit of obiltoxaximab was demonstrated in the studies using human equivalent doses of 
antibiotic in rabbits. However, since treatment with obiltoxaximab in combination with an antibiotic 
increased survival compared to placebo, it can be concluded that obiltoxaximab does not have a 
negative impact on the survival rate in rabbits or cynomolgus monkeys when co-administered with an 
antibiotic at human-equivalent or lower than human-equivalent dose.  
No human data on the PD effects are available. The description of PD effects is based solely on in 
animal models of inhalation anthrax. 
No human data in patients with inhalation anthrax are available. The effectiveness of obiltoxaximab in 
patients is solely based solely on efficacy data in animal models of inhalation anthrax.  
The effectiveness of obiltoxaximab in paediatric patients is solely based on efficacy data in animal 
models of inhalation anthrax. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Infusion related reactions including hypersensitivity reactions were frequently reported in subjects who 
received obiltoxaximab. In single-dose Pool of the Primary Safety Population (subjects who received 
the commercial formulation) hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 8.8% of subjects in the 
obiltoxaximab group compared to 5.7% in the placebo group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of subjects presented with ADAs was low considered that this is a chimeric mAb. 
Obiltoxaximab has been evaluated only in healthy adult volunteers, however it was not evaluated in 
the target population i.e. patients with inhalation anthrax or in healthy people exposed to anthrax 
spores. There is a theoretical risk that the safety profile of obiltoxaximab could be different in the 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 106/113 
 
 
  
 
 
target population. However, since obiltoxaximab does not have an endogenous human target and does 
not exhibit unspecific cross-reactivity in human tissues, the theoretical risk of target-mediated toxicity 
is negligible. Fc-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDC) is not a concern for obiltoxaximab treatment in 
the sought indication since obiltoxaximab only binds to soluble PA and does not bind to cell bound PA.  
Obiltoxaximab has not been evaluated in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or paediatric subjects. 
The frequency of AEs such as infusion related reactions, might be influenced by age-related factors, 
concomitant diseases, concurrent medications; however, clinical studies did not include a sufficient 
number of subjects ≥65 years to determine if the safety profile of obiltoxaximab is different from that 
seen in younger subjects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Since trials in patients with inhalation anthrax are not possible, either in the real life setting or as 
challenge studies, the establishment of therapeutic efficacy must be based on animal models and PK 
bridging. This application is therefore evaluated under exceptional circumstances in accordance with 
Article 14(8). Available data provide proof-of-concept for the treatment principle and indicate that 
efficacy in humans is possible, provided that relevant exposure is reached. While the translation of 
efficacy between species, and from a challenge model to real life, is fraught with uncertainty, the 
mechanism of action is plausible, since obiltoxaximab targeting a PA subunit of the anthrax toxin which 
is similar irrespective species. With PK and comparability issues solved, it is considered that proof of 
concept for obiltoxaximab administered as monotherapy is sufficiently demonstrated to a standard 
allowing product authorisation.  
It is appreciated that obiltoxaximab will be administered to patients in combination with antibiotics. 
Still, given the high lethality of inhalational anthrax once symptoms have occurred, it does not appear 
that a demonstration of additive effects in combination is necessary, as it would be reasonable to add 
an intervention with a different mechanism of action to antibiotics, provided that there is reasonable 
evidence of the efficacy of that intervention. Duly recognising the limitations of an efficacy 
demonstration based on animal models, it is considered that the efficacy of obiltoxaximab has been 
sufficiently substantiated, given the limitations of possible studies for inhalation anthrax. 
While the precise time-window after infection or onset of symptoms, as prerequisites for obiltoxaximab 
therapy to be beneficial, cannot be defined based on the animal models, data support the anticipation 
that efficacy will be greater the earlier therapy is initiated. Therefore, not only the treatment 
indication, but also the prophylaxis indication for the rare patient that is not eligible for antibiotics is 
considered supported by the data. 
The conclusions above are contingent on the clarification that exposure in humans is likely to be 
sufficient. Overall obiltoxaximab dose of 16 mg/kg is well-tolerated when administered IV as a 90-
minute infusion. The AEs were usually mild and moderate. Infusion related reactions including 
hypersensitivity were frequently reported in subjects treated with obiltoxaximab. However, no data in 
EMA/524933/2020  
Page 109/113 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the target population as well as in vulnerable population i.e. pregnant women, nursing mothers, 
paediatric subjects or elderly are available. Due to the mode of action target-mediated toxicity is not 
expected. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Inhalational anthrax is a life-threatening disease, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 50% 
even with aggressive treatment including multiple antimicrobials [Jernigan et al, 2002]. 
A combination treatment with antibiotics and obiltoxaximab benefits from the complementary mode of 
action, i.e. targeting the bacteria and targeting the toxin moiety. In the efficacy studies in anthrax-
challenged animal, the combination of obiltoxaximab and antibiotic was effective in increasing the 
survival rate when compared to placebo, even though the added benefit of the combination treatment 
to antibiotic was not demonstrated.  
Although naturally occurring inhalational anthrax is a rare condition, occurring sporadically around the 
world in individuals and small clusters of people exposed to infected animals and animal products, 
anthrax spores have been used in the past and have the potential to be used in the future as biological 
weapons. The possible exposure of large numbers of people to air-borne B. anthracis spores in the 
context of a bioterrorist attack raises many issues, not least the availability of antibiotics, compliance 
of long-term antibiotic administration, or resistance development. In this situation obiltoxaximab offers 
an additional option for post-exposure prophylaxis especially in subjects with contraindications for 
antibiotics or in situations where a shortage of antibiotics is experienced. Such use is supported by the 
efficacy study using obiltoxaximab as a monotherapy. Given the indication claim to use of 
obiltoxaximab also in asymptomatic patients that were or may have been exposed to inhalation 
anthrax when alternative therapies are not appropriate or are not available, is acceptable.  
The safety data of obiltoxaximab show an acceptable safety profile in healthy young adults. The 
exclusion of vulnerable population in the phase I study program is acceptable. Due to the epidemiology 
of the disease i.e. very rare incidence of natural inhalation anthrax, the generation of safety data in the 
target population for obiltoxaximab i.e. general population including vulnerable population, is not 
feasible at the moment and will be subject to a Post-Marketing Study.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As inhalational anthrax is encountered very sporadic, it is impossible to predict when and where cases 
/outbreak will occur. Due to the high mortality rate even with standard of care and the anticipated 
clinical benefit, it would be highly unethical to conduct randomised controlled clinical studies with 
obiltoxaximab in patients with inhalational anthrax. It was not feasible to evaluate efficacy of medical 
countermeasures against inhalational anthrax in clinical studies, because the incidence of naturally 
occurring disease is too low, and it is unethical to intentionally expose humans to anthrax. Therefore, 
efficacy is bridged for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax from two well-
characterised animal models, NZW rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, via healthy animals to humans 
based on similar or higher exposure in humans. Since PK data are generated in healthy humans, the 
impact of physiological consequences of disease, as well as target mediated clearance, remain an 
uncertainty.

Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied for 
indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence, and it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to 
collect such information.  
The following arguments were carefully considered and supported by CHMP:  
1. Inability to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of the indication 
Given the extremely rare occurrence of spontaneous cases of inhalational anthrax, it is not feasible to 
conduct clinical trials in humans with inhalational anthrax disease. Furthermore, while it may be 
possible to collect clinical data with obiltoxaximab in patients with anthrax disease upon the occurrence 
of an anthrax outbreak, it remains highly unpredictable if, when and to what extent such an outbreak 
would occur. 
2. Inability to collect such information because it would be contrary to medical ethics 
Performing randomised clinical trials actively exposing human subjects to infectious diseases such as 
B. anthracis spores would be against medical ethics.  
Performing a randomised controlled trial, in the case of an anthrax outbreak, in which a treatment that 
is expected to increase the approximately 50% survival rate in patients with inhalational anthrax 
disease is withheld from the patients in the control arm, would also be against medical ethics.  
Conditional approval is not appropriate for obiltoxaximab, as it is very unlikely that a comprehensive 
data package can be generated for obiltoxaximab in the future. This is because there is no possibility 
to conduct prospective randomised controlled clinical studies with obiltoxaximab in patients with 
inhalational anthrax disease and the opportunity for data collections is limited to open-label single-arm 
field studies with retrospective elements that can only be conducted upon the occurrence of an anthrax 
outbreak. 
The totality of the above limitations prevents generation of comprehensive data for Obiltoxaximab SFL. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Obiltoxaximab SFL is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Obiltoxaximab SFL is favourable in the following indication: 
“Obiltoxaximab SFL is indicated in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs in all age groups 
for treatment of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis (see section 5.1). 
Obiltoxaximab SFL is indicated in all age groups for post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax 
when alternative therapies are not appropriate or are not available (see section 5.1).” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription  
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.

Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
This being an approval under exceptional circumstances and pursuant to Article 14(8) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Due date 
SOB 1. Validation of the obiltoxaximab PK method (GCL-160) in 
human serum 
In order to validate the obiltoxaximab PK method (GCL-160) in 
human serum, the MAH should submit the results from the assay 
validation for the following aspects prior to use of the assay for 
sample analysis for clinical study AH501: interference by PA (63 and 
83), EF, LF and ADAs, and assay performance in haemolytic and 
lipemic serum. Parallelism should be performed with incurred 
samples from the planned open-label field study AH501. 
To be submitted together 
with the final clinical report 
of study AH501 
SOB 2. A phase 4, open-label field study (Study AH501) to evaluate 
the clinical benefit, safety, and pharmacokinetics of obiltoxaximab 
when used in the treatment of suspected, probable, or confirmed 
cases of inhalational anthrax due to B. anthracis 
Annual reports to be 
submitted  
In order to evaluate the clinical response, safety and tolerability, 
including the course of illness and survival in subjects with 
suspected, probable, or confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax 
treated with obiltoxaximab, the MAH should conduct, according to 
an agreed protocol, and submit the results of the final report for the 
phase 4, open-label field study AH501 upon the occurrence of an 
anthrax outbreak in the countries where obiltoxaximab is authorised 
and available. 
Final report will be provided 
no later than 12 months 
after the last administration 
of obiltoxaximab or last 
data collection in case of 
retrospective data 
collection 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that obiltoxaximab is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

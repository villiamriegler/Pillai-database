COVID-19 vaccine 
safety update  
COMIRNATY 
BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH 
The safety of Comirnaty is continuously monitored and safety updates are 
regularly provided to the public. This document outlines the outcomes 
from the assessment of emerging worldwide safety data carried out by 
EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) (see section 
1). It also contains high-level information from the reporting of suspected 
adverse reactions, which PRAC takes into account in its assessments (see 
section 2). 
This safety update follows the update of 18 June 2021. 
Main outcomes from PRAC's latest 
safety assessment 
Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) 
or membrane (pericarditis) may occur in a 
small number of people after vaccination with 
Comirnaty.  
The product information will be updated.    
Comirnaty is effective in preventing COVID-19. 
The safety updates are published regularly at COVID-19 vaccines: 
authorised. All published safety updates for Comirnaty are available at 
Comirnaty: safety updates.

COVID-19 vaccine safety update 
COMIRNATY 
Since its marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) on 21 
December 2020 until 4 July 2021, more than 276 million doses of 
Comirnaty have been administered in the EU/EEA1.

1.  Updates on safety assessments for 
Comirnaty 
Based on new safety data, including the latest Monthly Summary Safety 
Report (MSSR)2 from the marketing authorisation holder and data 
reported by patients and healthcare professionals to EudraVigilance (see 
section 2), PRAC assessed the following at its meeting held 5 to 8 July 
2021: 
Myocarditis and pericarditis  
PRAC concluded that myocarditis and pericarditis can occur in very rare 
cases following vaccination with Comirnaty and should be added in 
the product information as new side effects, together with a warning to 
raise awareness among healthcare professionals and people taking these 
vaccines. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions of the heart. 
Symptoms can vary but often include breathlessness, a forceful heartbeat 
that may be irregular (palpitations), and chest pain. 
The product information will be updated to include these side effects with 
a frequency category of ‘unknown frequency’, because it is generally 
difficult to robustly estimate side effect frequencies from cases of 
suspected side effects that have been reported spontaneously by 
healthcare professionals or patients. 
In reaching its conclusion, PRAC took into consideration all currently 
available evidence on both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, i.e. Comirnaty and 
Spikevax. This included an in-depth review of 145 cases of myocarditis in 
1 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) collects these 
exposure data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the 
European Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.   
2 Monthly Summary Safety Reports, also referred to as pandemic summary safety 
reports, will be compiled by the marketing authorisation holders to support timely and 
continuous benefit-risk evaluations for COVID-19 vaccines used during the pandemic. 
These reports complement the submission of Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs).

the EU/EEA among people who received Comirnaty. PRAC also reviewed 
reports of 138 cases of pericarditis following the use of Comirnaty. As of 
31 May 2021, around 197 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines had 
been given in the EU/EEA (approximately 177 million doses of Comirnaty 
and 20 million doses of Spikevax). In addition PRAC also looked into cases 
received worldwide.  
The cases primarily occurred within 14 days after vaccination, more often 
after the second dose and in younger adult men. In five cases that 
occurred in the EU/EEA, people died. They were either of advanced age or 
had concomitant diseases. Available data suggest that the course of 
myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is similar to the typical 
course of these conditions, usually improving with rest or treatment.  
Healthcare professionals should: 
- be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis in 
people who have had these vaccines;  
- tell people receiving these vaccines to seek immediate medical attention 
if symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis occur; and 
- consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g. cardiologists) 
to diagnose and treat these conditions, as people with myocarditis or 
pericarditis may require specialist treatment. 
Although the risk of these conditions occurring is very low, people who 
have received this vaccine must seek immediate medical attention and 
treatment to help recovery and avoid complications if they have the 
following symptoms suggestive of myocarditis and pericarditis: 
- breathlessness; 
- a forceful heartbeat that may be irregular (palpitations); or 
- (acute and persisting) chest pain. 
Questions about the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in EU Member States 
can be addressed to healthcare professionals or the national health 
authority. 
EMA confirms that the benefits of Comirnaty continue to outweigh the 
risks, given the risks of COVID-19 illness and related complications; 
scientific evidence shows that the vaccine reduces deaths and 
hospitalisations due to COVID-19.  
A direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) will be sent in due 
course to healthcare professionals prescribing, dispensing or administering 
the medicine. The DHPC will also be published on a dedicated webpage. 
The PRAC recommendations will be submitted to EMA’s human medicine 
committee, CHMP, for endorsement3.

Other events - Asthenia, lethargy, decreased 
appetite and (nocturnal) hyperhidrosis 
Based on data from the ongoing clinical trials (see section 2), the 
following events are currently under consideration by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to be newly added as side 
effects to the product information of Comirnaty: asthenia (lack of energy 
or strength), lethargy (state of indifference and inactivity), decreased 
appetite and (nocturnal [nighttime]) hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). 
The frequency category which is under consideration for all these events is 
‘uncommon’ (i.e. occurring in less than 1 in 100 individuals).  
2.  How safety is monitored 
As for all COVID-19 vaccines, relevant new information emerging on 
Comirnaty is collected and promptly reviewed. This is in line with the 
pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines of the EU regulatory 
network (comprising the regulatory bodies of the EU Member States, EMA 
and the European Commission). 
Case reports of suspected side effects 
Collecting reports of medical events and problems that occur following the 
use of a medicine, and therefore might be side effects, is one of the pillars 
of the EU safety monitoring system. Healthcare professionals and 
vaccinated individuals are encouraged to report to their national 
competent authorities all suspected side effects individuals may have 
experienced after receiving a vaccine even if it is unclear whether the 
vaccine was the cause. For more information on how to report, see 
Reporting suspected side effects. 
These spontaneous reports are collected in EudraVigilance, the EU 
database used for monitoring and analysing suspected side effects. 
Publicly available information can be accessed via EudraVigilance – 
European database of suspected drug reaction reports in all EU/EEA 
languages. Search for “COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine PFIZER-BIONTECH 
(Tozinameran)” to see all suspected side effect cases reported for 
Comirnaty. 
As of 4 July 2021, a total of 206,668 cases of suspected side effects with 
Comirnaty were spontaneously reported to EudraVigilance from EU/EEA 
countries; 3,848 of these reported a fatal outcome4,5. Around that time 
4 These figures have been calculated excluding cases reported from Northern Ireland (EU 
reporting requirements for suspected adverse reactions to EudraVigilance apply to 
Northern Ireland in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland). 
5 Source: EudraVigilance. These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public 
database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side 
effects. As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case 
report, the total number of side effects will never match the number of individual cases.

COMIRNATY 
about 276 million doses of Comirnaty had been given to people in the 
EU/EEA6.  
These reports describe suspected side effects in individuals, i.e. 
medical events observed following the use of a vaccine. The fact 
that someone has had a medical issue or died after vaccination 
does not necessarily mean that this was caused by the vaccine. 
This may have been caused, for example, by health problems not 
related to the vaccination.  
The EU regulatory network continuously monitors EudraVigilance to detect 
any new safety issues. EudraVigilance relies on individual healthcare 
professionals and patients to report their own experience. The monitoring 
detects unusual or unexpected patterns in the reports received for further 
investigation and risk assessment. EMA’s detailed assessments take into 
account all available data from all sources to draw a robust conclusion on 
the safety of the vaccine. These data include clinical trial results, reports 
of suspected side effects in EudraVigilance, epidemiological studies 
monitoring the safety of the vaccine, toxicological investigations and any 
other relevant information. 
Planned and ongoing studies 
The company that markets Comirnaty will continue to provide results from 
the main clinical trial, which is ongoing for up to two years. It will also 
conduct additional studies to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the 
vaccine as it is used in vaccination campaigns and other clinical practice. 
For the list of planned and ongoing safety studies for Comirnaty, see the 
risk management plan.  
A paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Comirnaty is in place. This 
describes how the company will collect data on the vaccine’s efficacy and 
safety for its potential use in children.  
In addition, EMA is coordinating observational studies in EU Member 
States looking at real-world data from clinical practice to monitor the 
safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including in pregnant 
women. 
3.  Other information for Comirnaty 
Comirnaty is a vaccine that was authorised in the EU on 21 December 
2020 to prevent COVID-19 when infected with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-
2. The initial marketing authorisation was for use in people aged 16 years 
and older; on 31 May 2021, the marketing authorisation was extended to 
Similarly, this public database does not provide the total number of cases reported with a 
fatal outcome.

exposure data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the 
European Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

use in individuals aged 12 years and older. COVID-19 is a potentially 
severe disease that may result in death. 
Comirnaty contains a molecule called mRNA, which the body uses to 
temporarily produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is broken 
down shortly after vaccination. The spike protein does not cause COVID-
19.  
Before Comirnaty was granted an EU marketing authorisation, the efficacy 
and safety of the vaccine were assessed through pre-clinical studies and 
large clinical trials. More than 18,000 participants had been given the 
vaccine in clinical trials.  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not 
everybody will experience them. The most common side effects known for 
Comirnaty are usually mild or moderate and get better within a few days 
after vaccination. 
More information on how Comirnaty works and its use is available in all 
EU/EEA languages in the medicine overview. This includes information on 
use in pregnant and breastfeeding women and immunocompromised 
individuals. 
The full product information with the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet is also available in all EU/EEA languages.

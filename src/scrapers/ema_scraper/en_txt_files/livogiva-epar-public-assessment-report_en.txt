2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Osteoporosis, as defined by World Health Organization, is a systemic disease of the skeleton 
characterised by low bone mineral density (BMD) and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue 
with consequent increased bone fragility that predisposes to fracture risk. Due to the silent progression 
of bone structure degeneration, osteoporosis diagnosis often follows a painful fracture event.  
The diagnosis of osteoporosis is established by means of bone densitometry or by the presence of a 
fragility fracture. Any bone may be affected; although the skeletal sites most prone to fracture include 
proximal femur (hip), vertebrae (spine), and distal forearm (wrist). Osteoporotic fractures lead to pain 
and occasional disability. More importantly, they increase mortality. 
Osteoporosis is commonly experienced in postmenopausal women due to declining oestrogen levels. 
However, osteoporosis can also occur in both sexes as a side effect of prolonged treatment with 
glucocorticoid medications. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis may be responsible for up to 20% of 
all osteoporosis cases. Fractures, primarily hip fractures, decrease a patient’s quality of life by 
increasing pain, medical costs, morbidity, and mortality. 
In 27 European Union (EU) countries, the prevalence of osteoporosis was estimated to be 6.6 % and 
22.1 % in men and women, respectively, aged 50 years or more and 5.5 % in the general population. 
According to the National (US) Osteoporosis Foundation, up to 25% of men over the age of 50 years 
will experience a fracture due to osteoporosis, with approximately 80,000 suffering from a broken hip. 
Current pharmacological options for the treatment of osteoporosis in Europe include anti-resorptive 
agents (e.g. bisphosphonates, calcitonin and raloxifene), which reduce osteoclastic activity, strontium 
ranelate, which reduces osteoclastic activity and may have anabolic properties as well, and parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) analogues including teriparatide, which stimulate bone turnover with a positive bone 
balance thereby increasing bone mass. In addition, denosumab, an anti RANKL antibody that reduces 
osteoclast activity, is available. Romosozumab, an antisclerostin antibody, has been recently 
authorised in the US. 
About the product 
Teriparatide, PTH (1-34) is the international non-proprietary name (INN) for the biologically active 34-
amino acid N-terminal fragment of the 84-amino acid native parathyroid hormone, PTH (1-84). 
Synthetic and genetically engineered versions of teriparatide both exist, sharing identical affinity for 
the parathyroid hormone (PTH) surface receptors as well as possessing the same biological activity.  
The active substance in Livogiva biosimilar, teriparatide, is produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens using 
recombinant DNA technology. 
Recombinant teriparatide contains no amino acid substitutions or chemical modifications and differs 
from the synthetic peptide only in its method of production and purification. Recombinant teriparatide 
contains no glycosylation or other post-translational modifications. 
Endogenous PTH (1-84) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and 
kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone formation by direct effects on bone 
forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and increasing the 
tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 10/67 
 
 
 
The molecular effects of teriparatide are mediated by the parathyroid hormone-receptor-1 (PTH-R1), a 
G–protein-dependent membrane receptor expressed by osteoblasts and renal tubular cells. 
Teriparatide has similar affinity for the PTH-R1 as PTH (1–84). PTH signalling results in the activation 
of genes important for the functions of mature osteoblasts, increases in osteoblast number, decreases 
in the apoptotic rate of osteoblastic cells, and increases in their bone-forming activity. The net result is 
an increase in the number of active osteoblasts, a decrease in osteoblast apoptosis and probably a 
recruitment of bone lining cells as newly formed osteoblasts, which are followed by increasing bone 
strength, mass and diameter and bone structural integrity, as well as increasing levels of biochemical 
markers of bone turnover (both formation and resorption markers) in serum and urine (Blick et al., 
2008). 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: 
H05AA02 
The drug product of Livogiva is a sterile, aqueous, isotonic solution for subcutaneous injection pre-filled 
in a 3 mL glass cartridge assembled to the pen injector. The cartridge is non-replaceable (integral drug 
device combination – DDC). The solution for injection is delivered from the manually operated fixed-
dose pen injector that delivers 20 micrograms teriparatide per 80 microliters dose. Each pen injector is 
intended to deliver 28 doses (equivalent to 2.24mL of solution). The product is administered by using 
commercially available needles.  
The recommended dose is 20 µg administered once daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection in the thigh 
or abdomen. The maximum total duration of treatment with teriparatide should not exceed 24 months. 
The 24-month course of teriparatide should not be repeated over a patient’s lifetime. 
In this assessment report, the following names are used for the applied product: Livogiva, PF708 and 
Pfenex teriparatide.  
Reference medicinal product(s): 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a drug product as a biosimilar to the reference 
medicinal product Forsteo, 20 micrograms / 80 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen, marketed in 
Europe by Eli Lilly and Company Limited. As part of the global product development approach, the 
finished product was also developed to be equivalent to the reference listed drug (RLD) Forteo 20 
micrograms / 80 mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen, marketed in the United States by Lilly USA. 
The entire non-clinical and clinical dossier is based on comparability to the RMP Forteo (US reference 
medicinal product) and the quality analytical exercise establishes the bridge between US RMP Forteo, 
EU RMP Forsteo and PF708.  
Both Forteo and Forsteo are produced in E. coli, while the active substance in Livogiva is produced in 
Pseudomonas fluorescens. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Livogiva has been developed as a biosimilar to Forsteo. The finished product supplied as a sterile, 
aqueous, isotonic solution for subcutaneous injection. One pre-filled pen of 2.7 mL contains 675 
micrograms of teriparatide as active substance (corresponding to 250 micrograms per mL). Each dose 
of 80 microliters contains 20 micrograms of teriparatide. Other ingredients are: glacial acetic acid, 
sodium acetate trihydrate, mannitol, metacresol and water for injections (WFI).

The product is available in 2.7 mL solution in cartridge (siliconised Type I glass) sealed at one end with 
a bromobutyl rubber plunger and at the other end crimp-sealed with a bi-layer combi-seal 
(polyisoprene/bromobutyl rubber laminate with aluminium over cap). The cartridge is an integral and 
non-replaceable part of the pen injector, therefore representing an integral DDC (Drug Device 
Combination). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance, teriparatide (INN) is a recombinant 1-34 N-terminal fragment of endogenous 
human parathyroid hormone, rhPTH(1-34) produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens using recombinant 
DNA technology and is identical to the 34 N-terminal amino acid sequence of endogenous human 
parathyroid hormone. 
The molecular weight of teriparatide is approximately 4117.8 Dalton (C181H291N55O51S2). The amino 
acid sequence is as follows: 
H-Ser Val Ser Glu Ile Gln Leu Met His Asn Leu Gly Lys His Leu Asn Ser Met Glu Arg Val Glu Trp Leu Arg 
Lys Lys Leu Gln Asp Val His Asn Phe-OH 
Binding of PTH to PTH-specific cell-surface receptor (PTHR1) mediates the biological action of PTH. The 
84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the bone formation by direct effects on bone-
forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and increasing the 
tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney. 
The amino terminus is critical for G-protein linked stimulation of adenylate cyclase that catalyses the 
formation of second messengers such as cAMP that activates the desired biological effects by 
phosphorylation of critical intracellular proteins. 
Higher-order structure 
The overall structure of crystalline hPTH (1-34) is a slightly bent helix. In solution, PTH (1-34) forms a 
N-terminal helix and a C-terminal helix connected be a highly flexible region, as determined by NMR. 
The extended helical conformation observed in the crystal structure may well represent the active 
receptor-binding conformation of hPTH (1-34). Figure 1 shows superimposition of the crystal structure 
of hPTH (1-34) with NMR structures of hPTH(1-34) in solution. Teriparatide contains no glycosylation or 
other post-translational modifications.

The biological activity of teriparatide was determined using a cell-based assay that measures the 
ability of teriparatide to induce release of cAMP after binding and activation of G-protein coupled 
receptor PTH-R1 in vitro in a rat osteosarcoma cell line (UMR-106, ATCC). 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturers 
GMP compliance for commercial manufacturing sites for active substance was demonstrated.  
Manufacturing process 
The manufacturing process involves the following steps (upstream, recovery and capture, downstream 
purification): 
Upstream process: including vial thaw, shake flask expansion and the fermenter production of the 
fusion protein and the cell paste stored frozen until further processing.  
Recovery and capture: including cell harvest via centrifugation, cell lysis via homogenisation, capture 
via chelating Sepharose fast flow chromatography and the fusion protein cleavage.  
Downstream purification: including various chromatographic steps. 
The active substance is filled in bottles and stored. 
Control of materials 
The quality of the materials used in the manufacture of teriparatide active substance is controlled by 
suitable specifications. Supplier tests performed in line with the in-house specifications for non-
compendial raw materials have been provided and are acceptable. Where applicable, compendial tests 
are used and specifications followed when materials are tested. Information about specifications of the 
chromatography resins used during the manufacturing process were submitted. Representative 
analysis certificates for non-compendial raw materials were also provided. 
Expression system:  
Teriparatide is expressed in a recombinant Pseudomonas fluorescens expression strain PS708-0336. 
Derivatives of a natural isolate of P. fluorescens biovar I, designated MB101 were used, which were 
obtained from lettuce leaves in 1984 by Mycogen Corporation. MB101 is a gram-negative, obligate 
aerobe that is nonpathogenic for plants and mammals. This species is ubiquitous in soil, water, and 
plant environments. 
The identity of strain MB101 has been verified independently. Phenotypic analyses of strain MB101 
involved a variety of biochemical and microbiological characterisations. Genotypic analyses were 
performed. Sequence analyses corroborate the findings of the phenotypic analyses. 
Cell bank system:  
A standard two-tiered cell banking system consisting of Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank 
(WCB) was created and tested under GMP conditions. The MCB was established from a Research cell 
bank (RCB) of P. fluorescens expression strain PS708-0336. Characterisation of the RCB was 
performed. 
Adequate information on the cell bank establishment, storage (WCB at two separate sites), 
characterisation, stability data and on the establishment of a new WCB were provided. Genetic stability

was shown by characterising an end of production cell line (EPC). The full DNA sequence of the strain 
PS708-0336 construct was provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The critical steps for teriparatide active substance production process were established through process 
development and process characterisation. The control strategy is based on a risk evaluation including 
process parameters as well as critical quality attributes (CQA). A risk assessment was performed to 
classify and justify the parameters used in the upstream and downstream manufacturing steps of 
Teriparatide active substance. For every upstream process parameter a PAR (proven acceptable range) 
was established. 
A downstream process risk assessment was performed to classify and justify the parameters used in 
the downstream manufacturing steps of teriparatide active substance. Critical raw materials, used in 
the downstream manufacturing process, were further defined.  
Critical process parameters (CPP) and in-process controls (IPC) containing respective acceptance 
criteria were defined for the most manufacturing steps. IPCs are suitable and adequate to control 
process performance. 
The PARs were justified: the operating range that was used in GMP production (NOR) was narrower 
and provided the most consistent results even if success could be achieved outside the NOR and within 
the PAR. The following equation shows the relationship between PAR, NOR and the setpoint: PAR ≥ 
NOR ≥ Setpoint. This justification can be followed. 
A risk assessment for identification of material attributes and process parameters with the potential for 
having an effect on CQAs were provided, as required by ICH Q11.  
A summary of the risk assessment performed on the manufacturing process of the active substance in 
order to classify the criticality of the process parameters and the raw materials and to identify the 
critical process parameters and raw materials that may impact the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of 
the active substance, was provided. The development of the used control strategy was sufficiently 
explained. The provided risk assessments include a criticality rank of the quality attributes. This issue 
refers to the active substance as well as finished product. 
Process Characterisation   
Process characterisation was performed on qualified scaled-down models of each of the unit operations 
of the active substance manufacturing process. The purpose of process characterisation was to 
increase process knowledge and evaluate process robustness. 
Process Validation and Evaluation 
The information for the process validation seems sufficient. Process validation on an adequate number 
of consecutive active substance commercial-scale batches has been performed. A summary of the 
results of the individual studies of the process steps investigated where provided, which confirm that 
the manufacturing process of teriparatide active substance solution seems to be suitable for its 
intended use. The CPPs and IPCs met the acceptance criteria demonstrating a consistent process 
performance, repeatable execution of manufacturing operations and the ability to meet final bulk 
active substance CQAs. 
Studies to evaluate column resin cleaning/re-use have been sufficiently performed. Information about 
the life cycle of the different column types used in the manufacturing process were provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 14/67 
 
 
 
 
A risk assessment in line with guideline ICH Q9 was performed in order to determine the teriparatide 
active substance process steps to examine for potential extractables and leachables (E&L). Single-use 
plastic components used at each step in the process were analysed for their materials of construction, 
time of product contact, temperature at which the contact occurs, nature of the process stream in 
contact with the material and the step proximity to the final product. The buffers were also examined 
by these same criteria. 
Sufficient investigations for leachables and extractables for the container/closure system and all the 
single-use production equipment were executed. Storage of the columns for the manufacturing process 
were validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The active substance manufacturing process development was initiated at a development laboratory, 
and the process was subsequently transferred to the clinical lot manufacturer and subsequently to the 
commercial active substance manufacturer.  
The development of the active substance up to transfer to the commercial manufacturing facility has 
been described and adequate process validation was conducted in the new site. 
A comparison of active substance manufacturing sites for clinical and commercial lots was done and a 
similarity study of finished product batches manufactured with active substance batches manufactured 
at either site was provided. Data from the finished product batches where the active substance batches 
were manufactured at the different sites are acceptable. Where analytical methods were different 
between buildings, then evidence of bridging was provided. Sufficient information was provided. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
Several batches were used for the characterisation of teriparatide. Data for several finished product 
batches manufactured with different active substance batches manufactured were provided.  
Impurities 
Process- and product-related impurities were sufficiently identified and quantified by state-of-the-art 
analytical methods including for oxidised and charged variants and high molecular weight impurities. 
Process-related impurities were also characterised and details on a risk and safety assessment 
provided. Host-cell proteins are quantified and justified.  
Teriparatide is expressed in P. fluorescens as fusion protein. Potential impurities were discussed and 
adequately justified compared to the reference product. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
The active substance specifications cover tests for identification, appearance, pH, bioassay, impurities, 
and microbial contamination. 
The active substance specification acceptance limits have been adequately set. Acceptable justifications 
for specifications were provided for all product parameters tested.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 15/67 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant is recommended to re-consider the active substance specification for one test when 
further stability data is available and adapt the specification accordingly if results show that the limits 
could be tightened (Recommendation). 
Analytical methods 
Teriparatide active substance is tested and controlled with verified current compendial and validated 
non-compendial analytical procedures. The methods used are adequate for routine control of 
teriparatide active substance. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data has been provided on several batches of teriparatide active substance, including 
from the commercial process. Results of all tested active substance batches were in line with the 
specifications of the active substance. 
Reference standard 
The applicant justified the proposed strategy for the reference standard use.  
Container closure system 
Recombinant teriparatide active substance is filled in polyethylene terephthalate Glycol (PETG) square 
bottles. It is closed with tamper proof high-density polyethylene (HDPE) screw caps.  
An extractable substances study was conducted with the bottle. No issues with regard to toxic 
substances were identified. The information provided about the container closure system is sufficient.  
Stability 
Teriparatide active substance stability has been studied under long-term storage conditions in line with 
ICH. All stability results obtained so far are within the specified ranges or limits for all batches in the 
long-term stability study.   
The applicant is recommended to continue the ongoing stability studies on active substance process 
validation batches and make available the stability data generated. The applicant also commits to 
immediately notify OOS results, if these occur (Recommendation). 
Several active substance batches were also stored under accelerated conditions acceptance criteria. 
Submitted results of the tested parameters are within the defined specifications and no trends were 
observed. 
Based on the stability results the claimed shelf life for the active substance is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The documentation for finished product is divided into:  
a)  Finished product cartridge (representing the injection solution filled in the primary 
container/closure system (cartridge)) 
b)  Finished product pen injector (representing the filled cartridge assembled to the pen injector) 
The finished product pen injector is defined to be the finished medicinal product.

Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Description of the product 
The finished product is a sterile, aqueous, isotonic solution for subcutaneous injection. It is supplied in 
a cartridge (siliconised Type I glass) in a pre-filled pen containing teriparatide as active substance. 
Other excipients are: glacial acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, mannitol, metacresol and water for 
injections (WFI).  
The cartridge (siliconised Type I glass) is sealed at one end with a bromobutyl rubber plunger and at 
the other end crimp-sealed with a bi-layer combi-seal (polyisoprene/ bromobutyl rubber laminate with 
aluminium over cap). The cartridges are an integral and non-replaceable part of the pen injector. 
The solution for injection is delivered from a manually operated, fixed-dose pen injector that delivers 
20 micrograms teriparatide per 80 microliters per dose containing 20 micrograms of teriparatide. Each 
pre-filled pen contains 250 micrograms per mL of teriparatide. 
Each pen injector is intended to be used to deliver 28 doses. An overfill is included and is justified. The 
overfill ensures the delivery of at least 28 doses as per intended use. Overages are not applicable. 
The finished product neither contains ingredients of animal or human origin nor novel excipients.  
With regard to the pen injector, the device does not incorporate tissues of animal origin (refer to 
assessment with regard to Annex I of Medical device directive Section 3.2.R). Therefore, the 
requirement of Draft Guideline EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019 to provide a statement on 
adventitious agents related to the manufacture of the pen injector is covered. 
Pharmaceutical development 
A)  Finished product cartridge: 
Formulation development 
The formulation development was based on the RMPs (reference medicinal products) Forsteo (EU) and 
Forteo (US). A QTPP (Quality Target Product Profile) as a prospective summary of the primary 
attributes guided the formulation development studies. 
The formulation process was transferred to the finished product manufacturer where engineering runs 
were performed to further refine and optimise the formulation.  
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing process development refers to the development of the finished product cartridge and is 
divided into the fill process development and the cartridge manufacturing process for registration 
batches.  
Finished product fill process development was illustrated in the dossier by tabling all batches 
manufactured (placebo, engineering, registration batches, RMP comparability batches, engineering fill 
study). 
A flow chart presenting the manufacturing process used for manufacture of registration batches 
including in-process parameters has been provided. Bioburden reduction is achieved before filling the 
cartridge and a final sterile filtration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 17/67 
 
 
 
 
  
Key manufacturing process steps and parameters for the finished product cartridge have remained 
consistent from the manufacture of the clinical and stability registration batches to the proposed 
commercial process.  
Subsequent optimisation activities were performed but are not considered to have any impact of 
clinical relevance. 
Identification and control as well as risk ranking of CQAs was sufficiently described.  
A table clearly assigning active substance batches to finished product batches (cartridge and pen) 
already manufactured thereof was provided. 
Microbiological attributes 
The preservative metacresol is added to the formulation in the same amount, which is used for the 
RMPs, and an anti-microbial effectiveness test was performed. Results indicate sufficient antimicrobial 
preservative effectiveness of metacresol at and below the nominal concentration.  
No hold times are applicable to the process, since continuous filling is performed. Current data do not 
show loss of metacresol during filling process. 
An anti-microbial effectiveness study according to requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.1.3 for the finished 
product with metacresol concentrations near or below the lower specification limit of metacresol in the 
finished product was performed and revealed acceptable results. 
Description of Container/Closure: 
The siliconised cartridge is made of clear type I glass, closed at one end by a combination seal and on 
the other end by a bromobutyl rubber plunger and represents the primary container/closure system. 
Figure 2. Primary container closure 
For the glass container compliance is confirmed with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1. “Glass containers for 
pharmaceutical use”, for plunger and combination seal compliance is also confirmed with Ph. Eur. 
3.2.9. “Rubber closures for containers for aqueous parenteral preparations, for powders and for freeze-
dried powders”. 
The containers proposed for routine storage are identical to those that have been used in stability 
studies supporting the shelf life. 
With regard to potential formation of silicone aggregates, it was clarified that routine tests would 
capture any aggregates that might result from the interaction between product and released silicone 
droplets. GMP batches were essentially free of particular matter and high molecular weight impurities. 
Stability data do not show any indication or release of silicone oil/formation of aggregates.  
Compatibility: 
The finished product solution contacts only the finished product cartridge and the injection needle. 
Compatibility was investigated by performing extractable/leachable studies, results remained below the 
analytical threshold.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Assessment report

Manufacture 
The GMP status is found acceptable for all finished product manufacturing sites mentioned in the table 
below. 
Manufacture of the product 
Finished product cartridge - formulation and fill process: 
After thawing of the active substance, it is mixed with formulation solutions. The solution gained is 
bioburden reduction filtered and sterile filtered and further transferred to the filling machine. After 
filling, the cartridges are packaged (bulk-packed cartons). 
Finished product Pen Injector – assembly process: 
Description of assembly of the constituent parts has been provided as well as final assembly. The 
finished product pen injector is finally labelled and packed into cartons. 
A table indicating the manufacturing steps, process parameters and in-process controls has been 
provided. Subassembly and assembly processes are described via flow-chart and photographs clearly 
illustrate the mechanical assembly process.  
Hold times were indicated and justified. Major equipment was sufficiently summarised. No reprocessing 
is performed.  
Process controls (cartridge and pen injector processes): 
Process controls have been provided and discussed by step, control, acceptance criteria and criticality. 
Acceptable process ranges were established during development. 
A process parameter is critical when that parameter leads to an impact to a critical quality attribute 
(CQA). Parameters that are well-controlled through effective in-process controls and/or in-process 
tests and/or release testing may be considered not critical. The criticality of process controls was 
evaluated through risk assessments. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process controls 
have been listed.  
A risk assessment leading to assignment of critical steps was performed following the principles of ICH 
Q9. 
Process validation /verification 
Process validation has been performed for the manufacture of teriparatide 20 micrograms/80 
microlitres finished product (cartridge) and for the assembly of teriparatide 20 micrograms/80 
microlitres finished product (pen injector).  
Process validation has been carried out on an adequate number of consecutive commercial-scale 
batches of teriparatide 20 micrograms / 80 microlitres solution for injection in pre-filled pen. Validation 
reports for teriparatide finished product (cartridge) and primary packaging assembly (pen injector) 
have been provided. 
Transportation studies have been carried out to support the shipment of the manufactured finished 
product manufactured. Container closure integrity of the cartrdiges was demonstrated to be 
maintained when the entire finished product packaging system is subjected to a specified testing 
schedule to represent the rigors of transportation handling and shipping.  
In accordance with EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015 “Guideline on the sterilisation of the 
medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container”, sterilisation methods for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020

containers and closures including acceptable validation were provided. Bioburden testing (Ph. Eur. 2-6-
12) and media fills were successfully performed. Holding times are mentioned, validation studies have 
been provided. 
Transportation studies have been carried out. No damage to the cartridges was observed and no dye 
ingress was observed in the test samples. Therefore, the container closure integrity of the PF708 
cartridges was demonstrated to be maintained when the entire finished product packaging system is 
subjected to the specified testing schedule to represent the rigors of transportation handling and 
shipping.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specifications have been developed as per ICH Q6B guidelines and cover 
identification, assay, pH, impurties, sterility, bacterial endotoxins of teriparatide finished product. 
Adequate justifications were submitted for each specification  
The applicant is recommended to re-consider the specification for one finished product specification 
when additional stability data on the finished product becomes available (Recommendation). 
Analytical procedures 
All analytical procedures used in batch release and/or stability testing of teriparatide finished product 
were described. Test methods are considered suitable for batch release and/or stability testing.  
Methods for particulate matter, sterility and bacterial endotoxins are compendial. Due to absence of 
compendial methods for determination of metacresol content, break-loose and sustaining glide force, 
dose accuracy and functional operations in-house validated methods are adopted, which is acceptable. 
Method validation reports were submitted for all tests. The non-compendial analytical procedures were 
validated according to ICH Q2 (R1).  
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses have been provided for a satisfactory number of batches of teriparatide finished 
product cartridge and batches of teriparatide finished product (pen injector). A summary of teriparatide 
finished product cartridge batches manufactured has been provided. The respective batch release data 
for each batch of finished product with the corresponding acceptance criteria has also been presented. 
Similarly, the batch summary for the teriparatide finished product (pen injector) batches and the 
respective batch release data have been provided. The certificate of analysis for teriparatide finished 
product cartridge batches and finished product (pen injector) batches have been provided. The batch 
analysis confirms consistency of the manufacturing process. This section is acceptable. 
Reference standards 
The same reference standards are used for release and stability testing of teriparatide active substance 
and finished product. Details regarding the description and the qualification of the reference standards 
are provided in the active substance section. 
Container closure system (pen injector) 
The pen injector represents a not-reusable integral Drug Device Combination (DDC) and is used 
together with commercially available needles (attached by the user and disposed after every use).  
Assessment report

Figure 3. Pen injector components 
The pen consists of a cartridge subassembly unit (CSU) and a dosing mechanism (DMS), produced by 
Ypsomed. The pre-filled cartridge is assembled to these two sub-assemblies and is non-replaceable.  
Figure 4. Pen injector subassemblies 
Therefore, absence of CE-certification and declaration of conformity are acceptable. 
Two sets of assessment were provided with regard to applicable essential requirements of Annex I of 
the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC. 
It is pointed out that a large amount of data was submitted for the DDC covering most aspects 
mentioned in Draft Guideline EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019. 
Minor modifications made to the pen injector after clinical trials were described and justified in detail. 
No changes were made to the materials, user interface, or principle of operation of the device. 
Therefore, these modifications are considered negligible and bridging studies are not considered 
necessary from a quality point of view. 
Pen injector design verification comprises a dose accuracy study acc. to ISO 11608-1, a storage and 
functional durability study for subassemblies and pen components, biocompatibility testing per ISO 
10993-1, investigation of fit/function of the cartridge, compatibility with other devices (needles), 
functional operation verification testing, design verification related to prevention of foreseeable misuse, 
a human factors validation study and use-related hazards.  
Given the depth of information that is provided in the different parts of the dossier, it can be concluded 
that an adequate control strategy was followed for the final assembled product in the pen injector

(DDC) starting with the submitted Quality Target Product Profile comprising certain primary attributes 
in relation to the DDC.  
Important basic parameters were considered such as: 
a) Finished product component quality: specifications/drawings, specifications of raw materials, in-use 
stability of DDC product (device component stability was investigated during development for 
subassemblies and assembled product). Storage conditions and maximum storage time are defined for 
subassemblies and DDC). 
b) Manufacturing process and design such as e.g.: subassembly and assembly process monitoring, In-
process-controls, CQAs (3.2.P.3.4. comprising dose accuracy and control of impurities during pen 
assembly and packaging), batch analysis data. Sufficient amount of information was submitted to 
demonstrate that an adequate control strategy is applied. 
Compatibility: 
Compatibility with other devices (needles) and biocompatibility were addressed adequately during Pen 
injector Design Verification. Instructions for use and handling in the SmPC are found sufficiently 
supported by these investigations. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 30 months when stored at 2°C - 8°C is claimed for the finished product. 
Long-term stability and accelerated conditions: 
Data from primary stability studies has been provided on commercial-scale batches of Teriparatide 
finished product cartridges and batches of Teriparatide finished product pen injector batches.  
Supporting stability data has also been presented on small-scale and commercial-scale batches of 
Teriparatide finished product cartridges and Teriparatide finished product pen injector.  
These studies are found to be in compliance with the ICH Guidelines. Commercial scale batches were 
included in the studies packed in the same container closure system proposed for commercial use. 
Thus, a sufficient representativeness of the commercial product has been ensured. The results do not 
reveal any significant changes or trends.  
Stability studies with process validation batches: 
The applicant is recommended to continue ongoing stability studies and make available the stability 
data generated. The applicant also commits to immediately notify OOS results, if these occur 
(Recommendation). 
Impurities are discussed further down below. 
In-use shelf life: 
The proposed in-use shelf life is to use within 28 days of the first use and has been supported by a 
number of in-use studies. 
Photostability: 
Similar photodegradation profiles were obtained for PF708 finished product and US RMP Forteo with 
both products being photosensitive.  
The pen injector has a cap to minimise photodegradation and physical damage to the cartridge. In 
addition, as per the SmPC, the finished product should be stored in a refrigerator at all times, and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 22/67 
 
 
 
 
pen should be returned to the refrigerator immediately after use. This ensures minimal exposure of the 
finished drug product pen injector to light. The respective instruction is currently only included in the 
user manual. 
Break loose and sustaining glide force: 
Data on cartridge batch was used to study break loose and sustaining glide force revealing acceptable 
results. 
Device related studies: 
The shelf life of the device constituent has been sufficiently addressed. The study design and tests 
performed at each time point have been presented. 
Based on all the stability data provided a shelf life of 30 months when stored at 2°C - 8°C is acceptable 
for the finished product. Once opened, the medicinal product may be stored for a maximum of 28 days 
at 2°C to 8°C. Chemical, physical and microbiological in-use stability has been demonstrated for 28 
days at 2°C - 8°C. Other in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Summary discussion with regard to product-related impurities: 
Specifications at the active substance level have been justified. Specifications/methods used for clinical 
batches have also been justified in line with applicable standards available at that time. When 
pharmacopoeial methods and standards became available, these were adopted.  
Subsequently, the finished product specification was again updated to include individual impurity limits 
for relevant impurities.   
Limits for impurities are based on the levels of impurities measured in the RMP, supported by batch 
analysis and stability data generated to date. An analytical bridging study was conducted to support 
any changes in methods made.  
The applicant clearly explained how data for clinical batches were generated and submitted impurity 
data for both clinical batches and justified these levels with respect to levels in EU-Forsteo and US-
Forteo. 
Data provided for “primary stability batches” supports the proposed shelf-life of 30 months at 2°C - 
8°C. Data submitted for “supportive batches” at 2°C - 8°C are ongoing and will be completed.  
The applicant is recommended to revise impurity specifications, if required after gaining further 
stability results (Recommendation). 
A risk assessment was conducted for PF708 (Teriparatide [rDNA origin] Injection) to identify potential 
elemental impurities (EI) that may be present in the finished product. The assessment considered all 
potential sources of introduction of EI into the finished product. Based on this assessment, it is 
concluded that no additional controls are required for EI in the finished product and no routine testing 
for EI are required at release of active substance because EI are controlled through raw material 
release testing by the manufacturers. 
Biosimilarity 
A number of different similarity exercises have been conducted:  
a)  A quality comparison of multiple batches of PF 708 finished product with US Forteo  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 23/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  A quality comparision of multiple batches of EU Forsteo with US Forteo   
c)  A three-way quality comparison of multiple batches of PF 708 finished product with US Forteo and 
with EU Forsteo  
d)  A biosimilarity study comparing additional batches of EU Forsteo with PF708 DP.  
The applicant explained that determination of CQAs for PF 708 finished product was performed using 
risk management techniques on the principles of ICH Q9. A criticality assessment was performed 
whereby quality attributes were ranked with consideration to impact and uncertainty. Criticality scoring 
as well as justifications for criticality scores of CQAs were submitted for drug product. The principal 
strategy for risk evaluation and classification is agreed, and the assigned criticality scores for some 
quality attributes have been justified.  
The applicant explained that the similarity ranges have been set based on all data available at the time 
from the multiple-lot Comparability Study between US Forteo and EU Forsteo and data from the 
multiple-lot Biosimilarity Comparability Study between PF 708 finished product, US Forteo and EU 
Forsteo. Comparability of US Forteo and EU Forsteo could be demonstrated. Consequently, the 
inclusion of US Forteo batches for the QTPP is acceptable.  
It is noted that the number of reference product lots included for establishment of biosimilarity ranges 
to evaluate similarity of PF 708 with EU Forsteo was somewhat limited for some tests in the initial 
application. On the other hand, the applicant provided an additional biosimilarity study comparing 
additional batches of EU Forsteo with additional batches of PF 708 finished product to substantiate the 
biosimilarity claim and this was acceptable. It is agreed that relevant parameters of the analytical 
methods used for the biosimilarity demonstration have been investigated and the analytical methods 
can be considered fit for use.   
The information provided is considered acceptable.

In summary, the initially raised issues on biosimilarity have been resolved based on an additionally 
conducted similarity exercise which further substantiated the biosimilarity claim. Taking these 
additional data into account as well as the fact that teriparatide is a rather simple, non-glycosylated 
polypeptide, the major objection on biosimilarity can be considered resolved. 
Comparability study between EU-licensed Forsteo and US-licensed Forteo 
The entire non-clinical and clinical development programme of the proposed teriparatide biosimilar PF 
708 was conducted with the US comparator product only. A comprehensive and robust quality bridge is 
a pre-requisite for a biosimilar development using a non-EEA authorised version of the RMP in the non-
clinical and clinical comparability programme. Major deficiencies concerning the comparability exercise 
aiming to demonstrate a comparable quality profile of the EU RMP Forsteo with US comparator product 
Forteo have been raised at Day120 and in response, additional testing of US Forteo batches was 
conducted. For relevant physicochemical quality attributes (e.g. purity/impurity profile by RP-HPLC and 
SE-HPLC) multiple batches of US Forteo batches have been compared with multiple batches of EU 
Forsteo batches. For other physicochemical quality attributes (e.g. primary structure/peptide mapping, 
higher order structure by CD, intrinsic fluorescence, and NMR, a reduced number of US Forteo batches 
was tested. Taking into account that these latter quality attributes have been investigated by 
qualitative or semi-quantitative tests methods the number of included US Forteo batches can be 
considered sufficient to gain insight into variability of US Forteo batches on the market.  
Also for the biological assays, additional data have been provided: US Forteo batches have been 
compared with EU Forsteo batches with the rat cell-based bioassay. In addition, the potency of Forteo 
batches from the US market and Forsteo batches from EU market has been tested as part of the 
additional comparability study performed between the Forteo, Forsteo and PF 708 finished product, 
using a human-cell based biological assay. Taking this dataset and the available comparative receptor 
binding data into account, it can be concluded that there are no significant differences in the biological 
characteristics between US Forteo and EU Forsteo.   
The available quality data generated in various separate comparability/similarity studies is presented 
and summarised in a “Data Analysis” document that has been provided as an annex to the response 
document along with statistical analysis that showed a comparable quality profile between US Forteo 
and EU Forsteo and thus, the major objection on the quality bridge between these two products has 
been solved.

The suitability of the statistics used for comparability evaluation of US Forteo versus EU Forsteo was 
questioned and the applicant reanalysed the US Forteo and EU Forsteo data – this reanalysis supported 
the biosimilarity claim. 
It is agreed that the comparison is now enhanced, both, by different comparability ranges and an 
additional approach based on the comparison of mean values. This approach is considered more 
complete and appropriate, even if there is no information about the underlying data distribution and if 
some CQA is analysed in log-scale, when appropriate. 
Although slight differences can be deduced from these more conservative approaches in the statistical 
evaluation, these differences in a limited number of quality attributes might be considered not relevant 
in view of the intrinsic variability of the molecule and assay methods. The concern is considered 
resolved. 
In summary, the initially raised major objection on the bridge between the EU-licensed Forsteo and 
US-licensed Forteo at the quality level is considered resolved. Furthermore, based on the available 
analyses it is highly unlikely that significant differences between the two reference products exist.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process of the active substance 
and finished product. With regard to the pen injector, the manufacturer confirms that the device does 
not incorporate tissues of animal origin (refer to assessment with regard to Annex I of Medical device 
directive Section 3.2.R). Therefore, the requirement of Draft Guideline 
EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019 to provide a statement on adventitious agents related to the 
manufacture of the pen injector is already covered.  
With regard to TSE the applicant confirmed that during manufacture no TSE-relevant ingredients are 
used. No concerns were raised regarding the adventitious agent safety evaluation. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance: 
•  Manufacturers: GMP compliance was sufficiently proven for two sites involved in the AS 
manufacturing  
•  Manufacturing Process: Sufficient information has been provided on cell line development and 
characterisation.  
•  Control strategy: After clarifications and response to questions, the control strategy was 
adequately justified.  
•  Process Characterisation: Detailed process characterisation was performed on qualified scaled-
down models of each of the unit operations of the drug substance manufacturing process.  
•  Process Validation: A process validation report was provided for the commercial process site and 
is sufficient to support a consistent process. 
•  Process Development: Development and upgrading studies for the manufacturing site were 
submitted. As part of technology transfer from the development company to clinical lot 
manufacturing site, consistency was demonstrated.  
Assessment report

A further transfer of the commercial-scale manufacturing process occurred and satisfactory 
comparability data were submitted and indicated that materials from both facilities are within the 
specified acceptance ranges.  
•  Specification. The acceptance criteria were evaluated based on a scientific approach or set 
according to the USP monograph. The specification proposed are acceptable. 
•  Stability studies: Stability studies are ongoing, design and batches used are considered 
acceptable. A shelf life of 18 months for the active substance when stored at the recommended 
storage conditions is acceptable. 
Finished product: 
The documentation for the finished product is divided into:  
a)  Finished product cartridge (representing the injection solution filled in the primary 
container/closure system (cartridge)) 
b)  Finished product pen injector (representing the filled cartridge assembled to the pen injector) 
The finished product pen injector is defined to be the finished medicinal product and an integral drug 
device combination. 
•  Pharmaceutical development: Satisfactory information relating to preservative efficacy and in-
use stability are provided. 
•  Control strategy: The control strategy of the finished product cartridge process was sufficiently 
documented. Information on risk assessments leading to identification of critical process 
parameters were submitted. With regard to excipients and container/closure system a sufficient 
control is in place and critical quality attributes were defined and are considered adequately 
controlled. Taken together, the control strategy confirms that the process is sufficiently controlled 
to ensure consistent and acceptable quality of the product.  No dedicated information on control 
strategy for the pen injector process (integral drug device combination-DDC) as requested by Draft 
Guideline EMA/CHMP/QWP/BWP/259165/2019 was submitted. However, given the depth of 
information provided in the different parts of the dossier and taken globally, it can be concluded 
that an adequate control strategy was followed for the final assembled product in the pen injector 
(DDC). 
•  Process validation: Results from process validation were submitted for the finished product 
cartridge manufacturing process and for automated assembly of the drug device combination. 
Shipment validation was provided. The information provided is acceptable. 
•  Product-related impurities: The proposed shelf-life of 30 months is considered acceptable. For 
details refer to the end of Subsection “Stability of finished product”, where an overall discussion on 
impurities is provided.  
•  Analytical procedures and validation of analytical procedures: Methods were either 
compendial or were adequately validated.  
•  Container/closure system: With regard to the container/closure system information provided is 
found sufficient. Fragmentation and self-sealing was sufficiently considered. 
•  Stability studies: Stability studies of supportive batches are ongoing; 30 months stability data 
were provided. Design and batches used are considered acceptable. 
Assessment report

Several in-use-studies were performed/initiated. Consequently, the requirement of Guideline 
CPMP/QWP/2934/99 to evaluate a minimum of two batches was followed. Anti-microbial 
effectiveness under conditions of in-use was considered within two studies. The information 
provided is sufficient. 
Based on all the stability data provided a shelf life of 30 months when stored at 2°C - 8°C is 
acceptable for the finished product. 
Regional information 
•  Biosimilarity exercise: An additionally conducted comparability exercise substantiates the 
biosimilarity claim. Taking these additional data into account, and considering that teriparatide is a 
rather simple, non-glycosylated polypeptide the biosimilarity exercise is considered acceptable.  
•  Comparability exercise between the EU-licensed Forsteo and US-licensed Forteo: The US-
authorised medicinal product Forteo was used as comparator in non-clinical and clinical studies. 
Thus, evaluation of the similarity and variability of Forteo and the EEA-authorised RMP Forsteo is 
particularly relevant for acceptability of the non-clinical and clinical study results. The initially 
raised Major Objection on the quality bridge between the EU-licensed Forsteo and US-licensed 
Forteo is considered resolved. With the additional testing and statistical analyses conducted the 
comparability exercise is considered sufficiently robust to exclude significant differences between 
the two reference products.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Satisfactory documentation has been provided. Overall, the data presented indicate that Livogiva is 
manufactured by a validated, controlled process taking into consideration relevant guidance 
documents. Batch release data also confirm that the product is of consistent quality. The results 
indicate that the finished product can be reproducibly manufactured.  Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are 
controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
The comparability data provided substantiates the biosimilarity claim. From a quality point of view, 
Livogiva is considered approvable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended some points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Teriparatide is a biologically active 34-amino-acid N-terminal fragment of the 84-amino-acid native 
human parathyroid hormone [PTH(1-84)]. Genetically engineered teriparatide was shown to possess a 
similar affinity for the parathyroid hormone-receptor-1 (PTHR1) as PTH(1–84). Binding of teriparatide 
to PTHR1, a seven-membrane spanning G-protein-coupled receptor, and subsequent activation of both 
the 3,5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A and the phospholipase C-
dependent protein kinase C pathway are the main signal streams to activate genes important for the 
functions of mature osteoblasts, to increase osteoblast number, to decrease the apoptotic rate of

Page 28/67 
 
 
 
osteoblastic cells, and to increase their bone-forming activity (Brixen et al., 2004, D’Amelio et al., 
2012). This results in increasing bone strength, mass and diameter and bone structural integrity, as 
well as increasing levels of biochemical markers of bone turnover (both formation and resorption 
markers) in serum and urine (Blick et al., 2008). 
The drug development programme for PF708 has been designed to primarily establish biosimilarity of 
PF708 to the US-marketed Forteo. Consequently, comparability among PF708, Forteo and the EU-
marketed Forsteo needed to be established to support the marketing authorisation of PF708 in EU. 
Comparability evaluation was based primarily on the development of specific and highly sensitive in 
vitro bioassays which are considered more adequate to detect potential differences between the 
biosimilar and the reference drug than in vivo studies in animals, as agreed by EMA SA.  
The nonclinical programme for the development of PF708 is based on the “Guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-
clinical and clinical issues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1). It consists of the following 
studies: 
1. In vitro studies; 
• a receptor binding assay to compare the binding characteristics to the PTHR1  
• cell-based bioassays using UMR-106 cells, a rat osteosarcoma cell line, to compare PTHR1 mediated 
cAMP release. Both submitted among the tests included in the Three-Way Comparability Study for the 
analytical assessment of comparability of PF708 to EU-Licensed Forsteo and US-Licensed Forteo. 
2. In vivo studies comprising of one Primary PD Study and one Tox study;  
• 6-week pharmacology study evaluating effects of PF708 and Forteo in a rat ovariectomy (OVX) model  
• 4-week toxicity study of PF708 and Forteo in rats, which includes anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
assessments. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The provided non-clinical comparability exercise primarily consisted of in vitro assays, which were 
developed and validated to evaluate comparability and demonstrate similarity between the biosimilar 
PF708 and the reference medicinal product Forsteo. Assessment of in vitro comparability studies is 
located in the quality part of the assessment report.  
An in vivo PD study in rats using the US reference product Forteo was also submitted. Ovariectomised 
Sprague Dawley rats (9/control and 18/treatment groups) were treated subcutaneously with PF708, 
respectively Forteo at a dose of 8 μg/kg/d for 6 weeks. No significant differences between the two 
products were observed. Analyses included the assessment of body weight, relative uterine weight, 
metaphyseal, trabecular, diaphyseal and cortical bone parameters measured by pQCT, and serum 
levels of bone turnover markers. Treatment effects on metaphyseal trabecular bone were similar 
between PF708 and Forteo. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics, Safety pharmacology, Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
studies 
In line with the current EU biosimilar guidelines no studies have been provided by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 29/67 
 
 
 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of PF708 was investigated and compared with Forsteo incorporated in a 4-
week repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in Sprague Dawley rats (described under Toxicology 
Section). No dedicated in vivo studies on ADME or other PK studies have been conducted to assess the 
pharmacokinetics of the biosimilar in accordance with guidance (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 
Rev1). An ELISA method was validated to determine PF708 (rhPTH(1-34)) and Forteo levels in 
Sprague Dawley rat plasma (K3EDTA) in a toxicokinetic study conducted in the frame of the repeat-
dose toxicity study. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In the repeat-dose toxicology rat study 30 µg/kg/day of PF708 or Forteo were administered daily via 
the subcutaneous route for 4 weeks. The dose of 30 µg/kg/day was chosen according to historical 
Forteo data, not expected to result in significant toxicity and provided a safety margin of ~15-fold over 
the proposed clinical dose based on AUC. The NOAEL for rats chronically treated with Forteo was 
considered to be 10 μg/kg. 
Treatment resulted in non-adverse effects on haematology and clinical chemistry. An increase in bone 
formation occurred in the sternum and in the distal femur and proximal tibia of femoro-tibial joint. 
Extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen was also found increased. Both, PF708 and the US 
reference product, showed similarity with regard to incidence as well as severity of these findings. 
These findings are the result of the known hormonal effect of the drug product in bone and spleen due 
to compensatory responses. No antidrug antibodies were detected throughout the study. Gender 
differences in systemic exposure were not observed. 
For toxicokinetic comparison between PF708 and Forteo, 30 µg/kg/day of either of the teriparatide 
drug products was dosed to rats of both sexes. Mean Cmax and AUC were comparable between PF708 
and Forteo on day 1 and 28 in female, and on day 28 in male animals. However, clear differences in 
plasma levels were observed in male rats after the first day of dosing. Thus, the applicant’s statement 
in the non-clinical summary ‘Mean overall concentrations were similar between day 1 and day 28 for 
both PF708 and Forteo. No gender differences were observed’ could not be agreed upon. However, as 
stated in the respective study report, on day 28 mean TK parameters were indeed comparable for 
PF708 and Forteo in both sexes. Although variability on day 1 was also high in male rats treated with 
Forteo, the overall differences in mean TK parameters are considered attributable to the high 
variability of individual TK values measured in male rats of both treatment groups. Moreover, only 3 
individual animals per sex and group were tested. 
In accordance with guideline on development of biosimilar medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1), other toxicological specific studies on genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance have not been conducted, 
as PF 708 has been developed as a proposed biosimilar to Forsteo.   
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
PF708, being developed as a biosimilar to Forsteo, and with teriparatide as the active substance being 
a recombinant human peptide, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment and thus, specific 
studies to evaluate the environmental risk are not required for this medicinal product. The applicant 
provided an appropriate justification for not submitting an Environmental Risk Assessment, as 
postulated in the CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
Assessment report

Page 30/67 
 
 
 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
For discussion of the in vitro data, reference is made to the respective chapter under ‘Quality aspects’. 
In vivo PD studies are usually not required for a biosimilar application according to recent guidance, as 
long as no specific concerns arise during in vitro comparability assessment that would require further 
elaboration on the level of in vivo studies. The submitted PD study was conducted using only Forteo, 
the approved US reference product, as comparator. In general, this approach would not be in line with 
recent EU guidance, where it is stated that ‘the reference medicinal product must be authorised in the 
EEA under Article 6, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC’. Moreover, 
the bridging study between Forsteo and Forteo on the quality level was not regarded sufficient (under 
‘Quality aspects’). However, for this type of MAA, non-clinical PD data is considered supportive only. 
Thus, the deficiencies of the conducted PD study discussed above are not deemed a blocking issue. 
In summary, supportive PD data did not reveal any significant differences between PF708 and the US 
reference product Forteo, which would warrant additional studies. 
Studies on secondary PD, safety pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic drug interactions were not 
conducted, which is in agreement with recent guidance on MAA for biosimilar medicinal products. 
Dedicated studies on ADME or other PK studies have not been conducted, in accordance with recent 
guidance. An ELISA was validated to determine PF708 (rhPTH(1-34)) and Forteo levels in Sprague 
Dawley rat plasma (K3EDTA) in a toxicokinetic study conducted in the frame of the repeat-dose 
toxicity study.  
The repeated-dose toxicology study, including the studies on toxicokinetics and immunogenicity, was 
conducted in compliance with GLP. US reference product Forteo was administered in this study – thus, 
this data is regarded to be supportive. Toxicity data shows that subcutaneous dosing of PF708 or 
Forteo at 30 μg/kg/day resulted in comparable responses, including expected effects on bone and 
extramedullary haematopoiesis. 
Mean Cmax and AUC were comparable between PF708 and Forteo on day 1 and 28 in female, and on 
day 28 in male animals. However, clear differences in plasma levels were observed in male rats after 
the first day of dosing). Thus, the applicant’s statement in the non-clinical summary ‘Mean overall 
concentrations were similar between day 1 and day 28 for both PF708 and Forteo. No gender 
differences were observed’ could not be agreed upon. However, as stated in the respective study 
report, on day 28 mean TK parameters were indeed comparable for PF708 and Forteo in both sexes. 
Although variability on day 1 was also high in male rats treated with Forteo, the overall differences in 
mean TK parameters are considered attributable to the high variability of individual TK values 
measured in male rats of both treatment groups. Moreover, only 3 individual animals per sex and 
group were tested. 
The ADA assays appear comprehensively validated to detect potential differences between PF708 and 
the reference product. No anti-drug antibodies were detected for either PF708 or Forteo in the 
immunogenicity study conducted. 
In accordance with guidance on development of biosimilar medicinal products, specific studies on 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and local tolerance have not 
been conducted. 
The applicant provided an appropriate justification (Module 1.6.1.) for not submitting dedicated studies 
to support the Environmental Risk Assessment, as postulated in the CHMP guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
Additionally, the approval of the biosimilar medicinal product is not considered to lead to an increase of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 31/67 
 
 
 
the total quantity of teriparatide released into the environment, and therefore will not result in an 
increase of risk to the environment during storage, distribution, use and disposal. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical comparability exercise primarily consisted of in vitro assays developed and validated to 
evaluate comparability and demonstrate similarity between the biosimilar PF708 and the reference 
medicinal product Forsteo. The respective results and assessment of the in vitro comparability studies 
are located in the quality part of the assessment report.  
The non-clinical in vivo studies provided as a part of the comparability programme are considered 
supportive data, because the biosimilar was only compared to the US reference product Forteo. 
Overall, the studies did not reveal any significant differences between PF708 and the US reference 
product Forteo. 
No major objections have been identified on the supportive in vivo studies and no concerns are raised 
with regard to PD, PK, and toxicology studies in animals. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The clinical development programme to show biosimilarity between PF708 (Livogiva; teriparatide 20 
mcg/80 µL solution for injection) and US-marketed Forteo consists of one comparative 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study in 70 healthy subjects (PF708-101) and one clinical immunogenicity study 
(PF708-301) in 181 in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and men with primary osteoporosis.

Method 
The validation data for the bioanalytical assays (ELISA, ECL immunoassay, Radioimmunoassay) used in 
the two clinical studies were submitted. Clinical Study PF708- 101 was designed to assess 
bioequivalence of the PK of PF708 and Forteo. Clinical Study PF708-301 compared the immunogenicity, 
PK, PD, and safety of PF708 drug product pen injector and Forteo.  
SOPs were submitted for a method description. The validation of the used assays followed the 
Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1 Corr.2). 
A cross validation study with the ELISA method was performed between the reference product Forteo 
and PF708.Validation was sufficiently executed. 
2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The comparison of the PK profiles of PF708 and Forteo was the primary objective of study PF708-101.  
PK profiles were secondary objectives in the clinical study PF708-301. 
Comparative PK-study PF708-101 
Study title 
A double-masked, randomised, two-treatment cross-over study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 
PF708 and Forteo administered by subcutaneous injection in healthy adult subjects. 
Study Design 
Study PF708-101 was a randomised, double-masked, single-centre, single 20 mcg fixed-dose, two-way 
crossover study, planned to compare the PK of PF708 (biosimilar teriparatide) with that of the 
reference medicinal product Forteo (US-sourced) in 70 healthy adults. 
Subjects were randomised to treatment sequences A (PF708 → Forteo) or B (Forteo → PF708). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 33/67 
 
 
 
 
 
A single 20 mcg/80 µL SC injection of PF708 or Forteo was administered in the morning in each period.  
There were two dosing days (Period 1 Day 1 and Period 2 Day 5), which were separated by a washout 
period of 3 days (+ up to 1 hour). In each period blood sampling for PK evaluation was performed 
before dosing and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 (± 1 minutes), 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360 and 480 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) post-dose. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate PK-equivalence between PF708 and the reference product 
Forteo following a 20 mcg/80 µL SC injection in healthy adult subjects. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the PD, safety and tolerability of a single 20 mcg/80 µL SC 
injection of PF708 as compared to data gained for Forteo. 
Study participants 
70 healthy adult subjects entered the study and were randomised to either of the two treatment arms, 
A (test → reference) or B (reference → test), meaning they acted as their own control group 
[Sequence A (n=35), Sequence B (n=35)]. 
Of the 70 subjects, approximately 40% of the study population were female subjects. 34 subjects were 
white, 31 subjects were Black or African American, 5 subjects were classified as `Others´. The mean 
age for all subjects was 33 years (range 20–53 years), the mean weight was 76.2 kg (range 47.7 – 
101.4 kg), the mean height was 173 cm (range 154–191.9 cm), and the mean body mass index (BMI) 
was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 20–29.9 kg/m2). There were no findings in the medical history of clinical 
concern for any subject and no baseline signs/ symptoms of clinical concern prior to dosing.

PF708 (test): A single 20 mcg/80 µL SC injection of PF708 (Pfenex Inc.) 
Forteo (reference): A single 20 mcg/80 µL SC injection of Forteo (Eli Lilly and Company) 
PF708 and Forteo were supplied as teriparatide 20 mcg/80 µL SC solution for injection. 
Both study drugs, PF708 and Forteo were supplied as teriparatide 20 mcg/80 µL SC solution for 
injection in a cartridge inserted in a reusable, multi-dose disposable delivery device (pen). One PF708 
cartridge of 2.4 mL contains 600 mcg of teriparatide (corresponding to 250 mcg per ml). The cartridge 
itself has a holding capacity of 3 ml, is made of siliconised Type I glass, supplied with a plunger 
stopper (halobutyl rubber) and disc seal (aluminium and polyisoprene/bromobutyl rubber laminate) 
assembled into a disposable pen. 
Subjects received the SC injection in the lower quadrants of the abdomen: in period 1 (Day 1) in the 
lower right quadrant, in period 2 (Day 5) in the lower left quadrant. Subjects were sitting or lying down 
during dose administration.

Participant Flow 
A total of 182 osteoporosis patients entered the study and were randomised to either of the two 
treatment arms, PF708 or Forteo. One patient randomised to receive PF708 withdrew from the study 
before the first dose of study drug was administered [PF708 (n=90), Forteo (n=91)]. Patient 115011 
had unevaluable samples due to a shipping error. The PF708 group consisted of 89 patients (97.8%) 
and were compared for PK analysis to all 91 patients (100%) of the Forteo group.

2.4.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
PD was a secondary endpoint in Study PF708-101 and in Study PF708-301. 
Study PF708-101 
PD samples were collected within 30 min predose and postdose at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours 
(±5 min) in Period 1 (Day 1-2) and Period 2 (Day 5-6).  
PD parameter 
The PD endpoint for the study PF708-101 included serum ionised Ca2+ concentrations and changes 
from baseline after SC administration of a single 20 mcg dose of PF708 or Forteo in healthy volunteers.  
Serum calcium concentrations were summarised by treatment received and presented graphically. For 
the statistical analysis, raw data for changes from baseline were analysed using a mixed model. The 
model included sequence, period, treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction as fixed effects 
and subject (sequence) as a random effect. The least squares (LS) means and 90% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for the difference between the PF708 and Forteo were calculated. In addition, the P-
values for the differences between both treatments at each specified time-point were calculated.

Data from Day 1 and Day 5 were pooled, and the LS means for changes from baseline for each 
treatment and at each specified timepoint were shown in the table. The calculated P-values at alpha 
level = 0.1 demonstrated that there were no significant differences between PF708 and Forteo in 
change from baseline of serum ionised Ca2+ normalised to pH 7.4 at any specified time-point from 1 – 
24 hours post dosing. 
Study PF708-301 
The PD endpoints for the study PF708-301 included the mean percentage change in lumbar-spine (L1-
L4) bone mineral density (BMD) and the median percentage change in serum BTM concentrations of 
P1NP (N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen) and CTX (crosslinked C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 
collagen) after baseline, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with PF708 or Forteo. 
PD parameters 
•  Bone Mineral Density 
Lumbar-spine (L1-L4) BMD was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is 
consistent with clinical practice and most clinical research protocols and is therefore supported. Scans 
were performed at screening to assess eligibility and to serve as baseline, at week 12, and at week 24.  
The analysis and comparison of lumbar-spine BMD data were performed separately for male and 
female patients. 
•  Change in Serum BTM Concentrations of P1NP and CTX 
Blood serum was analysed for changes from baseline in P1NP and CTX. Blood was drawn for analysis 
on Day 1 (pre-dose) as baseline, at Week 12, and at Week 24. 
Results 
Participant Flow 
84 PF708-treated patients (92.3%) and 86 Forteo-treated patients were included (94.5%) in the BMD 
population that compromised all patients in the safety population with a non-missing baseline value 
and at least one post-dose DXA assessment.

PD parameter 
•  Bone Mineral Density 
The percent change from baseline in L1-L4 total spine BMD is summarised for females and males in 
separated tables.  
Bone Mineral Density Results in Female Patients 
Mean baseline corrected L1-L4 total spine BMD values were similar for female patients in the PF708 
and Forteo groups. Mean BMD values increased to 0.8643 and 0.8642 for patients in the PF708 and 
Forteo groups, respectively at Week 12 (2.4324% and 2.6389% increase from baseline) and at Week 
24 to 0.8789 and 0.8744 (4.3955% and 3.8911% increase from baseline). 
Difference in percent increase in corrected L1-L4 total spine BMD at Week 24 was not considered as 
clinically meaningful or statistically different (P-value = 0.568) between PF708 and Forteo. 
Statistical analysis of corrected total hip BMD and corrected femoral neck BMD demonstrated similar 
results for female patients. The percent increases in corrected total hip BMD and corrected total 
femoral neck BMD at Week 24 were not statistically significant (corrected total hip BMD: P=0.828 and 
corrected total femoral neck BMD: P=0.228).

Bone Mineral Density Results in Male Patients 
The mean baseline corrected L1-L4 total spine BMD values of the male population were similar in the 
PF708 and Forteo groups. Mean BMD values increased at Week 12 to 0.9731 and 0.9945 for patients in 
the PF708 and Forteo groups, respectively (increase from baseline of 1.8445% and 2.2451%, 
respectively) at Week 24 (5.1491% and 4.4415%, respectively). 
The difference in percent increase was not considered clinically meaningful, and statistical analysis of 
these results indicated that the percent increases in corrected L1-L4 total spine BMD at Week 24 were 
not statistically significant (P=0.529).

Results for corrected total hip BMD and corrected total femoral neck BMD demonstrated slightly greater 
variability than those for total spine BMD, but statistical analysis of the percent increases in corrected

P1NP concentrations 
The GMR values for P1NP were 101.62% at Week 12 and 117.04% at Week 24 for PF708 and Forteo, 
which resulted in statistically non-significant P values (at Week 12 P = 0.8499 and at Week 24 P = 
0.0657).

CTX concentrations 
The GMR values for CTX (PF708 as test and Forteo as reference) were 104.13% at Week 12 and 
approximately 101.72% at Week 24. Statistical analysis for both time points (Week 12, P-value 0.6577 
and Week 24, P-value 0.8543) demonstrated statistically non-significant differences in CTX 
concentration in patients either treated with PF708 or Forteo. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In general, and aside from the raised and resolved quality concerns (e.g. regarding biosimilarity, 
material used in clinical trials, and bridging from EU to US reference), the development programme to 
demonstrate similarity between PF708 and Forteo with respect to PK is considered adequate and was 
performed in line with the guidance on similar biological products and broadly in line with Scientific 
advice obtained from the EMA.  
The clinical programme of PF708 is comprised of two studies with pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic 
and immunogenicity endpoints.  
Pivotal evidence for PK biosimilarity assessment is derived from the single dose, crossover study 
PF708-101 in healthy volunteers, where PF708 and Forteo (US-originator) were administered. This 
study used the 20 mcg dose, and included PK parameters as primary endpoints and PD parameters as 
secondary endpoints.  
Supportive patient PK data is derived from immunogenicity trial PF708-301 that also used the fixed 20 
mcg dose and evaluated PK concentrations and PK parameters as secondary endpoints.  
Study PF708-101 was conducted in healthy subjects. This is in line with applicable guidance 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) stating that “in order to reduce variability not related to 
differences between products, the studies should normally be performed in healthy volunteers unless 
the drug carries safety concerns that make this unethical”. The in vivo healthy volunteer model is 
regarded as adequate in most instances to detect formulation differences and to allow extrapolation of 
the results to populations for which the reference medicinal product is approved (the elderly, children, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 44/67 
 
 
 
 
patients with renal or liver impairment, etc.). Therefore, it is agreed that healthy volunteers represent 
the most sensitive study population for conducting the PK comparison. 
A crossover design was chosen to evaluate PK and PD comparability of PF708 and Forteo. A wash-out 
period of 3 days was applied between treatments to avoid bias in the PK analysis. Teriparatide 
concentrations in plasma were measured before dosing and at several time-points post-dosing. 
Narrower sampling times around Tmax would have better recorded the course of concentration and 
thus contributed to the assessment of biosimilarity. However, it can be assumed that the non-optimal 
sampling pattern did not introduce any systematic bias for the analysis, nor affect the analysis of the 
primary endpoints.  
The 90.00% CIs for the ratio of the test and reference product geometric means for the PK parameters 
AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax were fully contained within the standard BE acceptance interval of 
80.00-125.00%.  
Study PF708-301 was not intended to evaluate PK equivalence between PF708 and Forteo. However, 
based on sparse PK sampling, similar PK profiles were observed. Even though PK was not the primary 
objective of this trial (but rather comparability in immunogenicity), the applicant presented the 90% CI 
for several PK parameters. Observed variability for Cmax and AUC 0-tlast resulted in 90% CIs broader 
than expected and the 90% CI were not entirely contained in the 80% - 125% acceptance range; 
hence, equivalence criteria were formally not met. Furthermore, the resulting 90% for Cmax does not 
cover “1” indicating a statistically significant difference. The applicant argued that the differences could 
be due to several factors, including a parallel study design, a heterogeneous study population, and 
multi-centre study conduct. Several patients had one or more missing samples that may have further 
increased data variability. Overall, study design was not optimal to demonstrate bioequivalence in the 
intended patient population. 
Nevertheless, PK similarity was demonstrated in the pivotal PK-trial PF708-101 in healthy volunteers. 
No concern is raised regarding the patient PK data that - on a general level - seem rather confirmatory 
of the observed PK similarity in the more sensitive, healthy volunteer model. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, states that “in 
exceptional cases, the confirmatory clinical trial may be waived if physicochemical, structural and in 
vitro biological analyses and human PK studies together with a combination of PD markers that reflect 
the pharmacological action and concentration of the active substance, can provide robust evidence for 
biosimilar comparability.”  
For teriparatide, considering the simplicity of the molecule that makes investigation of similarity on a 
quality level easier and potentially less prone to uncertainty regarding its translatability to clinical level, 
a dedicated comparative efficacy trial is in principle not considered necessary. 
PD data (serum ionised Ca2+) from study PF708-101 in healthy volunteers; was evaluated as a 
surrogate marker of clinical efficacy and support of biosimilarity of both products. The difference 
between the LSMs for PF708 and Forteo, the respective 90% CI and p-values for the differences 
between the treatments at each specified time point were calculated.  
Analyses of concentration-time profiles and statistical analyses of changes from baseline indicate that 
PF708 and Forteo had similar effects on the serum concentrations of ionised Ca2+ after single 20 mcg 
SC injections in healthy volunteers. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 45/67 
 
 
 
 
The fixed dose of 20 mcg PF708 was also tested in the repeat dose study PF708-301. The endpoints for 
PD comparability included the mean percentage change in lumbar-spine (L1-L4) bone mineral density 
(BMD) and the median percentage change in serum concentrations of the bone turn-over markers 
P1NP and CTX after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with PF708 or Forteo.  
Lumbar-spine (L1-L4) BMD was assessed using DXA and scans were performed at screening to assess 
eligibility and at Week 12, and at Week 24. For BTM analysis, blood was drawn for analysis pre-dose 
and at Week 12, and at Week 24 and serum was analysed for changes from baseline in P1NP and CTX.  
Administration of PF708 and Forteo resulted in similar increases in lumbar-spine (L1-L4) BMD. Percent 
increases from baseline were comparable between both treatments in female and male patients at 
Week 12 and at Week 24. Total hip BMD and femoral neck BMD showed similar results. The percent 
increases in hip and femoral neck regions were smaller than those reported for total spine; however, 
results are in accordance with historical Forteo data. 
Serum P1NP and CTX concentrations and median percent changes were similar after PF708 or Forteo 
treatment. Although P1NP concentrations showed larger variability in the PF708 test group than in the 
Forteo group, there were no statistically significant differences in these parameters.  
The PD data could be considered supportive and the (secondary) PD endpoints have been met in both 
studies supporting comparability of PF708 and Forteo in PD. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a clinical point of view, all quality issues were resolved, PK/PD biosimilarity between PF708 and 
Forteo is considered to be supported. Comparability of the EU and US reference products Forsteo and 
Forteo (and thus, biosimilarity between PF708 and the EU reference product) has been demonstrated. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response study is required in the development of a biosimilar medicine. The proposed dosing 
regimen for Livogiva is identical to those approved for Forsteo. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity supportive data was generated in study PF708-101 and in study 
PF708-301. No dedicated efficacy study has been performed.

Human Factors Validation Study 
The PF708 pen injector was evaluated during a single-centre, unblinded, observational, simulated use 
Human Factors validation study. The PF708 Human Factors Validation Study was developed to identify 
usage errors along with their reported causes of 95 participants, consisting of representative trained/ 
untrained patients and caregivers, untrained HCPs, and untrained Forteo-experienced user groups.  
The performance of the participants has been defined as critical tasks (defined as tasks associated with 
a potential use error with significant harm) and essential tasks (defined as tasks that must be 
performed to use the device for the intended purpose but that are associated with a potential use error 
with a less severity of harm).  
Participants were evaluated based on objective observations made by the moderator and objective 
third-party personnel observing the sessions, as well as subjective feedback from the participant at the 
end of a simulated use exercise. A root cause analysis to assess the potential for harm that could be 
caused by any use error was conducted. Recommendations for mitigations were made to further 
reduce these errors. 
The findings showed that the Pfenex PF708 pen injector can be safely and successfully used by Forteo-
experienced and Forteo-naïve osteoporosis patients as well as caregivers and HCPs. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Not applicable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Similar efficacy for a biosimilar medicinal product can only be assumed if – in a stepwise approach – 
comparability to the reference product has been established on the physicochemical, biological and 
non-clinical level, and comparable clinical results are shown.  
No dedicated efficacy study has been performed, which is acceptable for teriparatide in principle. 
Biosimilarity testing at the clinical level is based on the comparative PK study performed in healthy 
subjects (under Pharmacokinetics section). The applicant further conducted an immunogenicity study 
(under safety section). Several PD parameters (serum calcium, BMD and bone turnover markers P1NP 
and CTX) were analysed comparatively in these two studies as surrogates for efficacy; results are 
overall supportive of similar efficacy of the biosimilar candidate and the reference product Forteo.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety evaluation regarding PF708 is based on two clinical studies. Safety data provided in support 
of this biosimilarity application was from the bioequivalence study PF708-101 in 70 healthy subjects 
and the comparative clinical immunogenicity study PF708-301 conducted in 191 women with PMO and 
men with primary osteoporosis.  
Immunogenicity Study PF708-301 
Study title 
A randomised study comparing the effects of PF708 and Forteo in patients with osteoporosis. 
Study centres 
This was a multi-centre study in 27 study centres in the United States. 
Study design 
This was a randomised, multi-centre, parallel-group, open-label study conducted in the United States 
to compare the effects of PF708 and Forteo after 24 weeks of treatment. A total of 182 men and 
women with osteoporosis were randomly assigned to treatment. Half of the patients were randomly 
assigned to receive PF708, and the other half were randomly assigned to receive Forteo. Each patient 
received 24 weeks of PF708 or Forteo by daily SC self-injection in the abdomen or thigh, except the 
first dose, which was administered by the Principal Investigator or a trained and qualified designee at 
the clinic. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the effects of PF708 and Forteo on immunogenicity after 24 
weeks of SC daily dosing in patients with osteoporosis. 
The secondary objective was to compare the PK, PD, and AE profile of PF708 and Forteo in patients 
with osteoporosis. 
Study participants 
Patients were 66.6 (± 8.38) years of age, and 58.6% were between the ages of 65 and 85 years. The 
majority of subjects were female (72.4%) and white (90.1%). Mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.42 
kg/m2. The number and percentage of patients who met the spinal fracture eligibility criteria was 
similar between the PF708 and Forteo groups. Of the 29 female subjects in each group who had their 
spine x-ray assessed, 16 (24.6%) of the 65 females in the PF708 group and 17 (25.8%) of the 66 
females in the PF708 group met spine x ray eligibility criteria.  
The most frequently observed concomitant medications in PF708- and Forteo-treated groups were 
calcium (by 75.6% and 68.1% of patients, respectively) and cholecalciferol by 57.8% and 63.7% of 
patients, respectively. The incidences of concomitant use of Vitamin D analogues and calcium by 
patients in the PF708 and Forteo groups were similar. 
Treatments 
• 
PF708 (test): Daily doses for 24 weeks of 20 mcg/80 µL SC injection of PF708 (Pfenex Inc.) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 51/67 
 
 
 
• 
Forteo (reference): Daily doses for 24 weeks of 20 mcg/80 µL SC injection of Forteo (Eli Lilly 
and Company).  
PF708 and Forteo were supplied as teriparatide 20 mcg/80 µL SC solution for injection. Each drug was 
supplied as a sterile, colourless, clear, isotonic solution in a glass cartridge, which was pre-assembled 
into a disposable delivery device (pen) for SC injection. 
Patient exposure 
All randomised patients received 24 weeks of PF708 or Forteo by daily SC self-injection, except of the 
first dose, which was administered by the investigator or a trained and qualified designee in the clinic.  
82 (90.1%) patients in the PF708 group and 81 (89.0%) patients in the Forteo group completed active 
study treatment. The safety analysis (safety population) included all subjects who received at least one 
dose of study drug. 181 patients (99.5%) were included in the safety analysis.  
The immunogenicity population included all patients in the safety population with a non-missing 
baseline value and at least 1 post-dose blood sample analysed for ADA. 179 patients (98.4%) were 
included in the immunogenicity analysis.

Adverse events 
Of the subjects dosed, 261 TEAEs were reported in the PF708 group and 276 TEAEs in the Forteo 
group. 53.3% of the patients in the PF708 group and 49.5% of the patients in the Forteo group 
reported a total of 213 TEAEs that were considered as related to study drug. 30% of the patients in the 
PF708-treated group and 30.8% of the Forteo-treated patients reported a total of 324 TEAE that was 
classified as unrelated to study drug. 
Most TEAEs were judged with a Grade 1 and Grade 2 intensity. 22 patients (24.4%) were judged as 
Grade 1 within the PF708 group compared to 35 patients (38.5%) in the Forteo group. 47 patients 
(52.2%) of the PF708 group suffered from Grade 2 intensity compared to 27 patients (29.7%). 4 
PF708-treated patients (4.4%) and 8 Forteo-treated patients (8.8%) had a severity of Grade 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 53/67 
 
 
 
 
whereas 2 PF708-treated patients (2.2%) and 3 Forteo-treated patients (3.3%) had a severity of 
Grade 4. 
The most common related TEAEs of both groups were in line with those listed in the Forsteo SmPC, 
mostly injection site erythema/ bruising/ reactions, and headache. A numerical imbalance was found in 
the occurrence of diarrhea (0 versus 6 patients [6.6% in the Forteo group]. However, diarrhea is 
considered to be a rather unspecific symptom that can be caused by multiple origins and is 
furthermore not known as a treatment-relevant adverse event of teriparatide.  
No relevant difference in the occurrence of TEAES between Forteo and PF708 was observed. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Fourteen patients (7.7%) had SAEs during the study, 6 patients (6.7%) in the PF708 group and 8 
patients (8.8%) in the Forteo group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 54/67 
 
 
 
 
Except for one case of SAE (patient 127006, PF708 group), none of the SAEs that occurred during 
study PF708-301 were considered to be related to any of the study drugs, PF708 or Forteo.  
Patient 127006 (PF708 group): On Day 5, the patient was found to have a SAE of anaphylactic reaction 
that was experienced as tongue and throat swelling. The patient reported in the hospital that the night 
prior, she started a topical facial cream (metronidazole) for rosacea. The emergency department 
diagnosis was allergic reaction and angioedema. The patient was discharged in a stable condition the 
same day and the swelling had resolved. 3 days later the patient gave herself another injection of the 
study drug and there were no AEs reported afterwards, although it was reported that the patient was 
not taking any anti-allergic treatment. When the patient visited the clinical site, no signs or symptoms 
indicated allergy to the additional dose of study drug she received the prior day.  
The Investigator assigned anaphylaxis as the final diagnosis. The Medical Monitor independently 
assessed the event and deemed the patient’s clinical presentation and physical findings to be more 
consistent with allergic reaction instead of anaphylaxis. Additionally, the Medical Monitor deemed the 
relationship to study drug as not related, due to: (1) the lengthy (>20 hours) temporal relationship of 
the event to study drug exposure, (2) potential confounding variables, including the start of a new 
medication the night prior to the event, and (3) the absence of AEs after repeated exposure to study 
drug. The patient received her last dose of study drug on Day 9. The study drug was withdrawn per 
decision by the investigator. The patient did not complete study treatment. 
According to the clinical study report, it rather looked more like an allergic reaction than an 
anaphylactic shock.  
No deaths were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory assessment was done at screening and at Week 1, 12 and 24. Chemistry, haematology, 
and urinalysis and incidence of hypercalcemia, medical history, vital sign measurements, physical 
examination, spinal x-ray, 12-lead ECG assessment, and concomitant medication use were evaluated.  
Overall, changes in clinical chemistry and haematology parameters were generally similar for the 
PF708 and Forteo groups and no potential clinical concerns were reported for any laboratory test 
parameters. 
No clinically meaningful observations or differences in vital signs or ECG findings were observed for the 
PF708 and Forteo groups.  
The administration of PF708 seemed generally safe and well tolerated as a single daily 20 mcg SC 
injection. 
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity was evaluated in the Phase 3 study PF708-301 as primary objective. 
Assay Validation 
Bioanalytical Methods Related to PF708-101 
RPTX-0254 (CA17791-04) – Screening assay: 
Immunogenicity was not specified as a study objective of study CA17791-02, due to single-dose, 
short-term treatment which was not expected to result in anti-drug antibody formation. However, to 
ensure a complete assessment and identify potential pre-existing antibodies in patients, a screening 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 55/67 
 
 
 
assay was validated and performed. No assay for the detection of potential neutralising anti-drug 
antibodies was validated. According to recent guidance an assay for detection of neutralising antibodies 
(nAbs) should be validated irrespective of the expected outcome of the screening assay. However, no 
binding ADAs were detected in the course of this Phase I study (as expected due to the low 
immunogenic potential of the drug product as well as due to single-dose, short term treatment). A 
comprehensive assay validation was conducted for the nAb-assay for the Phase III study. Overall, lack 
of a validated nAb-assay for study PF708-101 is deemed acceptable considering the arguments listed. 
The direct bridging ELISA method for the determination of anti-human PTH 1-34 (PF708) antibodies in 
human serum met the requirements as specified in the Study Validation Protocol. The ELISA method 
was validated with respect to precision, selectivity, specificity, sensitivity and titre precision, and 
stability. Stability was demonstrated for anti-PF708 antibodies in human serum samples under varying 
conditions of storage. It is acknowledged that validation report RPTX-0254 is the ADA validation report 
for study PF708-101. The applicant clarified that the used assay was further improved for the Phase III 
study. In the frame of this adaptation, the assay was additionally validated for its drug tolerance, with 
regard to interference in haemolysed samples, and high-dose hook effect. 
Bioanalytical Methods Related to PF708-301 
RPTX-0051 (ZZ49532-01) - Screening assay: 
Human serum ADA levels were analysed using an ELISA method validated with respect to sensitivity, 
specificity, intra- and inter-assay precision, and short- and long-term stability. PF708 and Forteo 
showed similar results during cross validation of the screening assay, thus justifying the use of a 
single-assay approach for detection of both, biosimilar and reference product. With exception of the 
product specific correction factor, all important parameters (validation cut point, specificity cut point, 
assay sensitivity) appeared similar between the two products. 
The validation screening cut point (vCP) was determined from sufficient individual lots of human 
serum, repeatedly analysed on different days, by different analysts, which is deemed acceptable.   
Rabbit PF708 anti-drug antibody was used as the positive control. The antibody was specifically 
generated for this study. A COA for the PC antibody was provided. 
Overall, it can be concluded that based on the cross validation of the assay, PF708 drug product and 
Forteo appear similar and a single-assay approach can be utilised for the measurement of both, anti-
PF708 and anti-Forteo antibodies. The requirements as specified in the Validation Protocol were met. 
RPTX-0022 (CA19715-01) - Neutralisation assay: 
A bioassay kit based on signal luminescence was used for determination of potential anti-PF708 
neutralising antibodies in human serum. The assay sensitivity was calculated to be 27.7 ng/ml (50% 
confidence interval). According to the submitted data, this value represents the assay sensitivity for 
anti-PTH mAb neutralising antibodies in human serum (82.5 ng/ml at 99% CI). Assay sensitivity for 
anti-PF708 neutralising antibodies in human serum was determined to be much higher (875.9 ng/ml at 
99% CI). Assay sensitivity established with anti-PTH antibody was deemed more representative by the 
applicant, because it is known to be a monoclonal, neutralising antibody compared to PF708, which is 
of polyclonal nature containing both, binding and neutralising antibodies. 
During selectivity testing, 4 out of 10 lots of osteoporotic human serum showed detectable levels of 
neutralising antibody in the unfortified matrix, whereas only one osteoporotic subject was reported 
with a positive nAb finding after treatment with PF708 or reference product, respectively. This was due 
to use of different cut point correction factors (established from either NHS or pre-dose samples, 
respectively). When using the correction factor established from pre-dose samples for selectivity 
testing in the assay validation none of the 10 osteoporotic lots would show positive results. PF708 was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 56/67 
 
 
 
used for assay validation of the applied neutralisation assay. No data on cross validation of the nAb 
assay was submitted. The applicant followed a risk-based approach during assessment of neutralising 
potential of ADAs, testing the neutralising impact of the PC only on PF708. This approach ensures that 
any nAbs against PF708 will be detected. Potential insensitivity against the reference product is 
regarded negligible in this approach which is in agreement with valid guidance. Additional dose-
response curves were provided by the applicant. These data confirm similar assay response for both, 
PF708 and reference product. 
Statistical Methods 
The frequencies of ADA positive and -negative patients at Week 1, 4, 12, and 24 were analysed using 
Fisher’s exact test. The two treatments were planned be considered statistically significantly different if 
the observed P value from the Fisher’s exact test was <0.05.  
With the chosen statistical testing approach, it was not investigated whether the effects of PF708 and 
Forteo on immunogenicity were equivalent. Interpreting non-significant results of a Fisher-Test as 
absence of a relevant difference in ADA incidence is not acceptable from a methodological point of 
view. In addition, no correction for multiple testing (statistical testing for 4 time points) was foreseen. 
Hence, the interpretation of trial outcome concerning non-relevant ADA incidence differences between 
the two treatments required further elaboration (in the Results section). 
Results 
Two PF708-treated patients and two Forteo-treated patients developed ADAs during the study. At 
Week 24, there were two ADA-positive findings for PF708 compared with none for Forteo; the 
difference was not statistically significant. Upon additional request, the difference in immunogenicity 
incidence between treatments (PF708 – Forteo) was estimated via 95% confidence intervals: incidence 
differences were 0.11% (with 95% CI: -15.1%; 15.4%) at week 12 and 2.47% (with 95% CI: -13.5%; 
18.3%) at week 24. Overall, point estimates for immunogenicity incidence seemed comparable 
between treatment groups and low rates of immunogenicity observed in the study would be consistent 
with historical Forteo findings. However, for the assessment of biosimilarity, the upper limits of the 
derived confidence intervals need to be taken into consideration. When doing so, the magnitude of 
incidence differences that cannot be ruled out (based on the evidence generated in Study PF708-301) 
appears large. 
PF708- related ADA findings were low in titre and became undetectable after cessation of therapy 
during follow-up, without apparent correlation with AEs of special interest or SAEs.  
One PF708-treated patient had antibodies with neutralising activity transiently detected at Week 4. 
Since the values of % change in BMD for this single patient were compared to the collective of either 
PF708 or Forteo-treated male population, the discrepancy seen in % change in BMD is not considered 
meaningful. It seems however, that the transient in vitro neutralising activity did not correlate with an 
apparent loss of pharmacological activity.  
However, while only one patient with positive nAb after treatment with PF708 was reported, selectivity 
testing reported 4 of 10 lots of osteoporotic human serum as positive; this needed further explanation 
(above in “Bioanalytical Methods Related to PF708-301”).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the PF708 group were 3 patients (3.3%) and in the Forteo group were 5 patients (5.5%) that had at 
least one TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. The total number of TEAEs leading to study 
treatment discontinuation was similar between the groups.  
In the Forteo group 2 cases of lung cancer emerged during the treatment with the reference medicinal 
product Forteo, which were both not considered as study drug-related condition. Arthralgia was the 
only condition that occurred in both groups and was considered as possible-related. The other TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation had only frequencies of 1 patient per group, which is deemed 
negligible. It is assumed that there were no relevant differences in the occurrence of TEAES between 
PF708 and reference product Forteo. 
Supportive safety data of Study PF708-101 (Pivotal biosimilar trial) 
Patient exposure 
All 70 enrolled subjects were included in the safety evaluation. 
Adverse events 
The number of TEAEs was similar between the PF708 and Forteo treatment groups. 64.3% of the 
subjects in the PF708 treatment group 62.9% of the subjects in the Forteo treatment group reported a 
total of 61 TEAEs.  
114 TEAEs were judged as mild (Grade 1), and within the PF708-treated group, 1 TEAE was judged as 
moderate (Grade 2). Of the 115 TEAEs, 110 were considered to be possibly or probably related to 
study drug, and 5 were considered to be unrelated to study drug.  
The proportion of TEAEs seemed to be similarly distributed between the two groups. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were related to injection site findings (injection site erythema, 
haemorrhage, and pruritus). An approximately equal number of these TEAEs were reported in the 
PF708 treatment group (N=46) and the Forteo treatment group (N=44). All of these injection site 
TEAEs were considered to be related to study treatment by the Investigator. 
Only one of the TEAEs (headache, Subject 148) was judged to be moderate (Grade 2), and the rest of 
the TEAEs were judged as mild (Grade 1). All TEAEs resolved by the end of the study, with the 
exception of 1 TEAE (ecchymosis; Subject 128) that was unrelated to study drug with an outcome 
listed as “Unknown” (Listing 16.2.7-1).  
The symptoms of the PF708 test group (erythema, haemorrhage, pruritus, headache, dizziness, and 
nausea) are included in the spectrum of known side effects of teriparatide.  
Adverse events in both groups PF708 and Forteo seem balanced. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No serious adverse event (SAE) or death occurred.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory assessment was done at screening and at Day 2, 4 and 6. Safety was evaluated by clinical 
laboratory tests (chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), medical history, concomitant medication use, incidence of hypercalcemia, 
adverse events (AEs), anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessment and local/ systemic reaction assessments.

Changes in clinical chemistry and haematology parameters were generally similar for the PF708 and 
Forteo groups. Differences between treatment groups in the incidence rates of patients with significant 
abnormalities were not reported for any laboratory test parameters. 
Immunological events 
Serum ADA was measured from predose on Day 1 and Day 5 of each period in each subject.  
No positive serum ADA samples were found. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
No AES lead to study discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
PF708 has not yet been marketed and hence no post marketing data are available for PF708. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse events 
The overall proportion of TEAEs observed in the immunogenicity study PF708-301 seemed to be 
similarly distributed between the two treatment groups. Also, the incidence of study drug-related or -
unrelated TEAEs between patients of the PF708 group and the Forteo group was considered balanced. 
Most of the TEAEs reported were judged as Grade 1 and Grade 2 intensity. There were less Grade 1 
and more Grade 2 TEAEs found in the PF708 test product- compared to the reference product arm. 
However, fewer patients were reported in the PF708 group with a more severe Grade 3 or even Grade 
4 intensity. The type of AEs reported was in line with those listed in Forteo SmPC, mostly nausea, 
headache, and injection site erythema. Injection site reactions that occurred after PF708 treatment 
were identified in same frequencies as for Forteo (wherein is stated that mild and transient injection 
site findings are common). Adverse events reported in both study arms appeared in a balanced ratio.  
The supportive safety data obtained from study PF708-101 demonstrated similar distribution of 
adverse events between PF708 and Forteo that were broadly judged from mild intensity and were also 
resolved by the end of the study. More subjects of the PF708 group suffered from erythema (44 
events) compared to subjects from the Forteo group (40 events) and less subjects reported nervous 
system disorders (10 events) than subjects from the PF708 group (7 events). However, the differences 
between the groups seem rather negligible. The most frequently reported TEAEs were related to 
injection site findings (injection site erythema, haemorrhage, and pruritus). An approximately equal 
number of these TEAEs were reported between the study arms. The symptoms of the PF708 test group 
(erythema, haemorrhage, pruritus, headache, dizziness, and nausea) are included in the spectrum of 
known side effects of teriparatide. In this respect, adverse events in both groups PF708 and Forteo 
seem overall balanced. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Several SAEs that lead to study discontinuation occurred during trial PF708-301 but only one was 
considered from the Investigator as PF708 treatment-related. The patient of the PF708 group started 
(during daily PF708 injection) a metronidazole therapy for the treatment of rosacea, next day the 
patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Notwithstanding the above, the  Medical Monitor 
assessed the SAE to be more consistent with allergic reaction instead of anaphylaxis due to (i) the 
lengthy (>20 hours) temporal relationship of the event to study drug exposure, (ii) potential 
confounding variables, including the start of a new medication the night prior to the event, and (iii) the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 59/67 
 
 
 
absence of AEs after repeated exposure to study drug. Taken this into consideration, the ratio of SAEs 
between the PF708 and Forteo seemed balanced and no deaths occurred during the immunogenicity 
study PF708-301. 
Supportive safety data from study PF708-101 reported no SAEs and deaths. 
Immunogenicity  
In healthy subjects (study PF708-101), none of the samples were positive for neutralising antibodies, 
whereas in osteoporotic patients (study PF708-301) one sample of the PF708 group was (transiently) 
positive for nAbs. No clinically meaningful adverse effects associated with either pre-existing- or 
induced ADAs were apparent. However, the magnitude of ADA incidence differences that cannot be 
ruled out based on the evidence generated in Study PF708-301 requires adequate reflection in the 
evaluation of uncertainties in the (overall) biosimilarity assessment.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The applicant seeked approval for all the indications as approved for Forsteo:  
•  Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture;  
• 
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and 
men at increased risk for fracture. 
Analytical and functional biosimilarity exercise 
The analytical and functional biosimilarity exercise was performed in a three-way comparison between 
Pfenex Teriparatide solution for injection, Forsteo and Forteo. For that purpose, multiple different aged 
batches of each product were analysed. The analytical and functional testing panel is reasonable for a 
teriparatide  biosimilar  and  overall  adequate  for  the  comparability  testing  of  Pfenex  Teriparatide  DP, 
Forsteo and Forteo. Generally, orthogonal and state-of-the art methods were used and quality attributes 
relevant for the safety and efficacy of Teriparatide were included into the analysis.  
Clinical programme 
The clinical development plan for Pfenex Teriparatide solution for injection consists of one comparative 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study and one clinical comparative immunogenicity study. 
Study PF708-101 was a double-masked, randomised, two-treatment cross-over study that compared 
the PK of PF708 and US-approved Forteo, conducted at a single centre. 70 healthy male and female 
subjects received a single SC injection of PF708 20 mcg and Forteo 20 mcg separated by a 3-day 
wash-out phase. PK was assessed by the primary endpoints AUC0-tlast, AUC0-inf and Cmax.  
The secondary objective of Study PF708-101 was to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF708 
and Forteo and included serum ionised Ca2+ concentrations and changes from baseline. The safety 
objective of this study was the comparison of the adverse event (AE) profile and the evaluation of anti-
drug antibodies (ADAs).  
Study PF708-301 was a randomised, multi-centre, parallel group, open-label study that assessed the 
comparability of the immunogenicity of PF708 and Forteo. 182 females with PMO and males with 
primary osteoporosis received 24 weeks of treatment with PF708 or Forteo by daily SC self-injection.  
The secondary objective was to compare the PK and PD comparability and included the mean 
percentage change in lumbar-spine (L1-L4) bone mineral density (BMD) and the median percentage 
change in serum concentrations of the bone turn-over markers P1NP and CTX after 12 and 24 weeks of 
treatment. The safety objective was to compare the AE profile of PF708 and Forteo.   
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
The determination of high molecular weight impurities by SE-HPLC, analysis of the molecular weight by 
LC-MS and determination of the primary structure by peptide mapping indicate that Pfenex Teriparatide 
DP, Forteo and Forsteo are similar. Comparison of the higher order structure, for which far-UV circular

dichroism,  intrinsic  fluorescence  and  NMR  were  applied,  also  indicates  similarity  between  Pfenex 
Teriparatide DP and both reference medicinal products. PTH(1-34) receptor binding rates and potency 
between Pfenex Teriparatide DP, Forsteo and Forteo seem similar.  
An additional biosimilarity exercise comparing multiple PF708 DP batches and multiple EU Forsteo lots 
was conducted; results support the biosimilarity claim. Furthermore, a comparative accelerated stability 
study showed a similar degradation profile of EU Forsteo and PF708 DP.

Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK analysis of the comparative biosimilarity trial (PF708-101) showed that the 90.00% CIs of the 
geometric mean ratios of the ln-transformed endpoints AUC0-tlast, AUC0-inf and Cmax (primary 
endpoints) were within the predefined limits of 80.00 to 125.00% and hence supportive of similarity. 
The resulting primary parameters were: 
For AUC0-tlast, the GMR (PF708/Forteo) was 96.53%, 90.00% CI [90.01 - 103.52]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020

For AUC0-inf, the GMR (PF708/Forteo) was 98.99 %, 90.00% CI [92.54 - 105.89]. 
For Cmax, the GMR (PF708/Forteo) was 95.02 %, 90.00% CI  [88.41 - 102.12]. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The mean changes from baseline of serum calcium levels over time after single 20 mcg SC injections of 
the biosimilar candidate and the RMP, respectively, show similar and overlapping profiles in healthy 
volunteers. The calculated 90%CIs showed no significant differences between PF708 and Forteo in 
change from baseline of serum ionised Ca2+ at any specified time-point from 1 – 24 hours post 
dosing. 
The effects of teriparatide administered to osteoporotic patients as the biosimilar candidate and the 
RMP, respectively, were comparable after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. In terms of lumbar-spine 
(L1-L4) bone mineral density, the percent increases from baseline to week 24 were comparable 
between PF708 and Forteo in both female (P = 0.568) and male (P = 0.529) subjects for calculated 
95% CIs. The percent increase in corrected total hip BMD and corrected total femoral neck BMD at 
Week 24 in female and male patients did not differ significantly between treatments.  
90% CIs were calculated for bone turnover markers (P1NP and CTX) demonstrating similar median 
serum P1NP and CTX concentrations at baseline, week 12 and week 24 for PF708 and Forteo.  
Safety 
The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) was comparable between Pfenex 
Teriparatide solution and Forteo in healthy subjects and osteoporosis patients. 
No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in healthy volunteers and the ratio of SAEs between the 
Pfenex Teriparatide and Forteo seemed balanced in patients with osteoporosis.  
The type and incidence of adverse events with PF708 and the reference product were broadly 
comparable and largely in line with those expected based on the Forteo SmPC. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity seems comparable between treatment groups and rates of ADAs observed in the 
study are consistent with historical Forteo findings. At week 12, the incidence of ADA positive patients 
was 2/82 (2.44%) in the PF708 arm and 2/86 (2.33%) in the Forteo arm; ADA incidence was 2/81 
(2.47%) and 0/81 (0%), in the PF708 and Forteo arms, respectively, at week 24. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Clinical 
Immunogenicity 
Study PF708-301 investigated whether the effects of PF708 and Forteo on immunogenicity were 
equivalent. Following the originally applied statistical evaluation, a non-significant outcome of a 
superiority test was interpreted as evidence of equivalence in immunogenicity incidence. However, in 
the assessment of uncertainty of biosimilarity, the upper limits of the derived confidence intervals need 
to be taken into consideration for a worst-case evaluation. The applicant finally provided an estimate 
for the difference in ADA incidences between treatment groups at the 12- and 24-week time-points, 
with a confidence interval (95%, two-sided) for this difference: The upper limit was 15.4%-points for 
week 12 and 18.3%-points for week 24. It is acknowledged that the magnitude of these worst-case 
estimates for the incidence-difference can generally be explained by the low precision in estimation for 
Assessment report

Page 64/67 
 
 
 
a binary outcome in consequence of the sample size chosen. However, the magnitude of potential 
differences in immunogenicity incidence that cannot be ruled out by the data generated in PF708-301 
constituted an uncertainty for biosimilarity assessment calling for a risk assessment. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Initially  identified  deficiencies  of  the  biosimilarity  exercise  comparing  PF708  DP  with  EU-Forsteo  have 
been sufficiently addressed. In particular, the additionally conducted similarity exercise including multiple 
PF708 DP batches and additionally sourced EU Forsteo lots substantiates the biosimilarity claim. Taking 
the additional data into account and considering that teriparatide is a rather simple, non-glycosylated 
polypeptide, it is concluded that biosimilarity has been demonstrated.  
The entire non-clinical and clinical development programme of PF708 was conducted exclusively with the 
US comparator; a robust quality bridge is the pre-requisite for a biosimilar application in the EU when 
using a non-EEA authorised version of the RMP in the non-clinical and clinical comparability programme. 
The  initially  raised  major  issues  on  comparability  of  US  Forteo  with  EU  Forsteo  and  concerns  on  the 
suitability of the used statistics have been addressed. Based on all available data it is highly unlikely that 
real differences in the quality profile of US and EU reference product exist; thus, a reliable bridge between 
EU Forsteo and US Forteo has been established. 
The clinical data derived from the pivotal PK trial in healthy volunteers and an immunogenicity study in 
osteoporosis patients is suggestive of similarity between PF708 and the US reference. 
Challenge in conclusiveness regarding comparable immunogenicity 
Due to a different expression system as compared to originator Forsteo (P.fluorescens and E.coli), the 
applicant was advised to present a comparative immunogenicity study at time of MAA 
(EMEA/H/SA/3420/1/2016/III). The applicant followed this approach and presented a comparative 
PhIII trial in PMO patients (PF708-301) with comparative ADA incidence as the primary objective.  
The methodology of comparatively assessing this primary outcome was subject to several limitations 
and uncertainties, whose full scope only became obvious in the applicant’s d180 responses (see section 
above, for a full narrative of the methodological issue). The applicant provided an estimate for the 
difference in ADA incidences between treatment groups at time-points 12 and 24 weeks by making use 
of a confidence interval (95% two-sided). In the assessment of uncertainties of biosimilarity, the upper 
limits of these derived confidence intervals need to be taken into consideration for a worst case 
evaluation: for week 12 the upper limit was 15.4%-points ADA incidence in the investigated 
population, whereas for week 24 the upper limit was 18.3%-points, which appears a rather large 
difference.  
Concerning risk assessment of this issue, the following considerations are taken into 
account: 
• 
Except for the differences in expression system, no dedicated immunogenicity trial was 
required, due to the simplicity of the molecule (a polypeptide consisting of 34 amino acids, 
without glycosylation or other post-translational modifications) 
•  Similarity with regard to structure, biological characteristics and purity/impurity profiles 
between EU-Forsteo and Livogiva could be demonstrated by appropriate analytical methods. 
No significant differences in relevant quality attributes of this rather simple molecule were 
detected.  
• 
The molecule can also be synthesised and authorised via the generic/hybrid route, without 
presenting any immunogenicity data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379175/2020  
Page 65/67 
 
 
 
• 
EMA biosimilar guidance does not ask for confirmative equivalence testing of ADA incidence, 
and numerical results of ADAs in the study do not give rise to concern (Livogiva vs US Forteo, 
week 12: 2 vs 2 patients; week 24: 2 vs 0 patients). 
•  According to current knowledge, ADAs to teriparatide are not considered to have adverse 
clinical impact. 
• 
The clinical programme does not give rise to concern on the similarity of Livogiva and US 
Forteo. 
In conclusion, considering the totality of evidence on the quality, non-clinical and PK/PD level, the risk 
of a true difference in the immunogenicity profile of Livogiva vs Forsteo is considered low. The actual 
incidence of ADA positive patients was low and comparable and any clinical impact of the 
immunogenicity results as described in study PF708-301 would be considered unlikely. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The molecular effects of teriparatide are mediated by the parathyroid hormone-receptor-1 (PTH-R1), a 
G–protein-dependent membrane receptor expressed by osteoblasts and renal tubular cells. 
Teriparatide has similar affinity for the PTH-R1 as PTH(1–84). Ligand-bound PTH-R1 activates 
adenylate cyclase and certain phospholipases (A, C, and D), thereby increasing intracellular levels of 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium (Brixen et al, 2004). PTH signalling results in the 
activation of genes important for the functions of mature osteoblasts, increases in osteoblast number, 
decreases in the apoptotic rate of osteoblastic cells, and increases in their bone-forming activity 
(D’Amelio et al, 2012). This is followed by an increase in the number of active osteoblasts, a decrease 
in osteoblast apoptosis and probably a recruitment of bone lining cells as newly formed osteoblasts, 
which are followed by increasing bone strength, mass and diameter and bone structural integrity, as 
well as increasing levels of bone turnover marker in serum and urine (Blick et al, 2008). 
It is assumed that this mechanism of action is the same for all approved indications of Forsteo. Hence, 
extrapolation to all approved indications of Forsteo is possible.  
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Livogiva is considered biosimilar to Forsteo. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Livogiva is favourable in the following indication: 
Livogiva is indicated in adults.  
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see 
section 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures but not hip fractures have been demonstrated.  
Treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and 
men at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1).

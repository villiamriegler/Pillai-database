PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION

AND TARGET POPULATION
II: 1.1
Ovarian Cancer 
Incidence
Globally, there were around 295,414 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2018, with 
67,771 occurring in Europe, 24,469 in the US, and 10,672 in Japan (Globocan 2018a). A 
higher incidence is seen in Europe, and particularly Northern, Central and Eastern Europe, 
where rates are over 9 per 100,000 woman years, Age Standardised to the World population. 
In Europe in 2018, ovarian cancer was estimated to be the fifth most common cause of cancer 
death (44,576 deaths) and the sixth most common newly diagnosed cancer (67,771 new cases) 
in females in Europe (Globocan 2018a).
Prevalence
The IARC estimated 762,663 five-year prevalent cases at the year 2018 in the world, 
including around 188,069 cases in Europe, 80,446 in Northern America, and 31,658 in Japan 
(Globocan 2018a). In the US, the complete prevalence of ovarian cancer cases is estimated at 
approximately 190,000 cases (Howlader et al 2014).
Prevalence of sBRCAm
From literature data and AstraZeneca unpublished data on file, the proportion of BRCAm
patients carrying an sBRCA mutation is between 6.4% and 10% (Cancer Genome Atlas 
Research Network 2011,Pennington et al 2014, Norquist et al 2016, Callens et al 2017, Mirza 
et al 2016, Coleman et al 2017, Dougherty et al 2017).
Germline mutations are prevalent in around 5 to 25%, with gBRCA1 mutations in 4 to 18% 
and gBRCA2 mutations in 4 to 7% (Eccles et al 2016). A recent study conducted in ovarian 
cancer patients in Germany (n=523) found a gBRCA1 prevalence of 15.5% and a gBRCA2 
prevalence of 5.5% (Harter et al 2017). Other global variations are likely, due to ethnic 
associations with carrier mutations.
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for the 
Disease
Ovarian cancer occurs only in females, and the incidence is notably higher in Europe, the 
US and worldwide in patients aged 65 and older (Lowe et al 2013), though gBRCA mutated 
ovarian cancer is associated with an earlier age of onset (around 53 years and 58 years with 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation respectively (Hirsch-Yechezkel et al 2003). Germline BRCA
mutation is also associated with certain ethnic lineages, such as Ashkenazi Jews. Large 
11 (85)

variations in incidence of ovarian cancer between different regions are partly associated with 
lifestyle (particularly null parity or delayed childbearing), age, ethnicity, socio-economic 
status and access to high-quality care. Ovarian cancers also tend to be more prevalent in 
developed societies where expected life spans are longer.
Several risk factors have been identified, including family history, low parity, infertility, early 
age of menarche, and late age of menopause (Coleman et al 2015). Other risk factors are 
oestrogen hormone replacement therapy and tobacco smoking, and (limited evidence) perineal 
use of talc-based body powder and exposure to X-radiation and gamma (γ)-radiation (for 
medical purposes) (Weiderpass and Labreche 2012). 
The average cumulative risks in BRCA1-mutation carriers by age 70 years were 39% (18% to 
54%) for ovarian cancer. The corresponding estimates for BRCA2 were 11% (2.4% to 19%) 
(Antoniou et al 2003, see Errata, page 709). Patients with BRCA mutation are also at 
significantly increased risk of other cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer.
The Main Existing Treatment Options
Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer
The current standard of care for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, including those 
patients with BRCAm high-risk ovarian cancer, consists of radical debulking surgery followed 
by post-operative platinum-based first line chemotherapy (NCCN Ovarian 2018). For patients 
for whom upfront surgery is unlikely to achieve a complete resection, treatment consists of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery and adjuvant 
chemotherapy (NCCN Ovarian 2018). Platinum containing chemotherapy is considered the 
treatment of choice for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, including 
those patients with BRCAm high risk advanced ovarian cancer.
First line chemotherapy is generally given for a maximum of 6 cycles. It usually cannot be 
continued until progression as it is associated with cumulative neurological, renal and 
haematological toxicities. Moreover, clinical outcomes do not improve if chemotherapy is 
extended beyond 6 cycles (Ledermann et al 2013).
The vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab (Avastin®) in combination with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab maintenance was the first approved agent 
in the first line maintenance ovarian cancer setting (EU: approved in 2011; Japan: approved in 
2013; US: approved in 2018). The olaparib tablet formulation is also approved in this 
indication in the US (2018), and the EU, Japan, Canada, Australia and Brazil (all approved in 
2019), for newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.
Olaparib tablet formulation in combination with bevacizumab is now available in the US, the 
EU and Brazil, as well as in other markets, for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
12 (85)

with advanced high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who 
are in response (complete response or partial response) to first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy with bevacizumab.
Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice for PSR ovarian cancer 
patients. Despite responding to treatment, most patients subsequently relapse and experience 
disease progression within a year of starting chemotherapy and require further chemotherapy 
with attendant morbidity (Colombo et al 2010). Subsequent to disease progression, treatment 
for all patients with PSR ovarian cancer is another platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, eg, 
a doublet combining carboplatin with paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin (Colombo et al 2010). Each of the successive lines of therapy is limited in 
duration even in responding patients due to the cumulative toxicity burden from cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. In between lines of treatment, patients wait and are watched for the next 
progression. In addition, in the EU, treatment options include the VEGF inhibitor 
bevacizumab (Avastin®), either in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine, followed 
by bevacizumab alone. Avastin® was approved in October 2012 for the treatment of patients 
with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF 
inhibitors or VEGF receptor targeted agents.
Trabectedin (Yondelis®) an antineoplastic agent was approved in September 2007, in 
combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, for the treatment of patients with relapsed 
platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.
There are currently a number of PARP inhibitors (including olaparib and niraparib) being 
investigated as anticancer agents for a range of indications. Niraparib (Zejula™) was 
approved on 29 April 2020 for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete 
or partial) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Rucaparib (Rubraca™) also received 
approval from the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with platinum 
sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with 
two or more prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate 
further platinum based chemotherapy.
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity
The 5-year relative survival of ovarian cancer patients in Europe is estimated to be 38% (Sung 
et al 2021). The age-adjusted mortality rate (according to the World standard population) for 
ovarian cancer is 5.1/100,000 in Europe, 4.1/100,000 in the US, and 3.3/100,000 in Japan 
13 (85)
EU RMP
Olaparib
AstraZeneca
29, 15 June 2021
(Globocan 2018a). Mortality rates reflect the age at diagnosis and the peak of mortality lies in 
older women aged between 75 to 84 years contributing 28.8% of mortality cases 
(Horner et al 2009). Most patients (>70%) present with advanced disease, in whom overall 
5-year survival is around 29% (Siegel et al 2018). Breast cancer susceptibility gene mutated
ovarian cancer presents characteristics that differ from wild type and between specific 
mutation type (BRCA1 and BRCA2) (Hennessy et al 2010). Breast cancer susceptibility gene 
mutated ovarian cancer is more likely to have serous histology, and is often diagnosed at a 
later stage and at a younger age than ovarian cancer without BRCA mutation.
Important Co-morbidities
Important co-morbidities, based on existing literature and the Swedish Cancer and 
Co-morbidity database have been reported as anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, bowel 
obstruction, renal failure, and secondary MDS/AML and other secondary cancers. Some 
comorbidities may be due to prior treatment.
An increased risk of primary breast, ovarian and prostate cancer in addition to secondary 
cancers has been reported among gBRCA mutation carriers (Bergfeldt et al 1995).
II: 1.2
Breast Cancer 
Incidence
Female breast cancer (ICD-10 code: C50) surpassed lung cancer as the global leading cancer 
in 2020 with an estimated incidence of 2.3 million newly diagnosed cases, representing 11.7% 
of all cancer cases. In 2020, a total of 684,996 women died of breast cancer, representing 
6.9% of all cancer deaths (Sung et al 2021, WHO Cancer today 2020). The global incidence 
rate of breast cancer in 2020 among women was 24.5% and the mortality rate was 15.5%, 
counting for 1 in 4 cancer cases and 1 in 6 cancer deaths. The incidence was the highest 
among all cancers in the vast majority of countries (159 of 185 countries) with the highest 
mortality in 110 countries (Sung et al 2021). However, these numbers vary widely in different 
geographical regions of the world. Incidence rates are reportedly 88% higher in transitioned 
countries than in transitioning countries1 (55.9 and 29.7 per 100,000, respectively), with the 
highest incidence rates (>80.0 per 100,000) in Australia/New Zealand, Western Europe 
(Belgium has the world’s highest incidence: 113.2 per 100,000) (WHO Cancer today 2020), 
Northern America, and Northern Europe and the lowest rates (<40.0 per 100,000) in Central 
America, Eastern and Middle Africa, and South Central Asia (Sung et al 2021). In the 
European Community in 2020, the number of cases of breast cancer in women and men was 
1 Here, we use the term transitioning for nations classified as low or medium Human Development Index (HDI), 
and we use transitioned for those classified as high or very high HDI.

355,457 and the number of deaths was 91,826 (ECIS 2020). Metastatic breast cancer remains 
an incurable disease with an estimated 5-year OS of 25.0% (ESMO 2019).
More breast cancer patients are diagnosed at an early stage (79.0% to 87.0% are diagnosed at 
Stage I or II), than a late stage (13.0% to 21.0% are diagnosed at Stage III or IV). Between 
6.0% and 7.0% of people have metastases at diagnosis (Stage IV) (Cancer Research UK). 
Stage at diagnosis has been associated with a degree of deprivation, age, and ethnicity 
(Lyratzopoulos et al 2013, Public Health England 2020). The incidence data presented here 
represents the majority of the patient population, diagnosed at an early stage, and also 
represented in the OlympiA study.
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and optimal treatment depends on pathological and 
molecular characterisation of the tumour. Early-stage breast cancer (Stages I to III) is defined 
as disease confined to the breast with or without regional lymph node involvement and in the 
absence of metastatic disease. Treatment for Stages I to III breast cancer usually includes 
surgery and radiation therapy, with the addition of chemotherapy for patients with high risk of 
recurrence, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery. Other drug therapies 
including endocrine and anti-HER2 therapy are additionally given depending on ER and/or 
PgR and HER2 status.
Prevalence
At the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer 
within the past 5 years, making it the world’s most prevalent cancer (WHO Breast cancer 
2021).
Tumour BRCA mutations (tBRCAm) can be of germline or somatic origin. Published analysis 
conducted at AstraZeneca, including tumours from patients coming from the US, Canada and 
Europe, indicate that 6.6% to 9.5% of breast cancers have loss of function BRCA mutations 
detectable in tumours, with around 3% to 5% of germline origin and at least 2% of somatic 
origin (Polak et al 2017, Sokol et al 2020). Moreover, studies examining the prevalence of 
gBRCA mutations in unselected European primary breast cancer patient populations report a 
range of 1.7% to 7.3% (Cortesi et al 2021, Høberg-Vetti et al 2016, Nilsson et al 2018, 
Winter et al 2016, van den Broek et al 2015); a single European study on patients diagnosed 
with primary breast cancer (Winter et al 2016) reports a sBRCAm prevalence of 3%. Mutation 
carriers are mostly younger and have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. 
Patients with a BRCA1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant are particularly predisposed to 
TNBC (ie, negative for HER2, ER and PgR), whereas ER and PgR positive tumours often 
develop in patients who carry BRCA2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant (Atchley et al 
2008, Lakhani et al 2002, Mavaddat et al 2012).

Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for the 
Disease
Breast cancer incidence is strongly associated with age, with age-specific incidence rates 
increasing steadily from age 30 to 34 and more steeply from age 70 to 74 (NICE 2018). 
Risk factors for breast cancer include modifiable factors such as weight, physical activity, 
hormone replacement therapy, nulliparity, breast feeding, ionizing radiation, and alcohol 
consumption; and non-modifiable factors such as age, sex, family history with or without 
high-risk germline mutation(s), early menarche, and dense breasts (Kluttig and 
Schmidt-Pokrzywniak 2009). 
A prospective study evaluating over 9,000 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (majority from Europe) 
reported that the cumulative breast cancer risk to age 80 years was 72% for BRCA1 and 69% 
for BRCA2 carriers (Murthy and Muggia 2019Murthy and Muggia 2019). For subsets of the 
disease, BRCA1 prevalence may be associated with younger age of onset as well as family 
history. According to the National Cancer Institute and the Robert Koch Institute, the overall 
mean age at first diagnosis for breast cancer is 63 years; while in unselected patients with 
TNBC, the mean age at first diagnosis is considerably earlier, with reports ranging from 51 to 
58 years. 
The likelihood range to detect BRCA pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants at any age in 
breast cancer patient populations is 0.4% to 7.5%, and in TNBC patient subpopulations is 
2.9% to 17.5% (Pujol et al 2021).
The Main Existing Treatment Options
The decision to treat patients with early breast cancer with neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy in addition to surgery/radiotherapy is driven by the consideration of clinical 
characteristics, tumour stage and pathology. Randomised clinical trials have found no 
significant differences in long-term outcomes when systemic chemotherapy is given before or 
after surgery (Mauri et al 2005, Rastogi et al 2008).
For TNBC, neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy has been the main systemic treatment option 
for patients since hormone therapy and HER2 targeted drugs are not choices for these patients. 
Chemotherapy treatment of patients with early-stage ER- and/or PgR-positive HER2-negative 
breast cancer should depend on the individual risk of recurrence and presumed responsiveness 
to endocrine therapy. For HR-positive patients with ≥4 positive nodes at definitive surgery, 
NCCN guidelines recommend that all patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy 
followed by endocrine therapy (NCCN Guidelines 2021); additional chemotherapy is also 
recommended to patients with HR-positive cancers that have high risk characteristics, such as 
high grade tumour, large tumour size (≥2 cm), pathologically involved lymph nodes, and/or 
high recurrence score (OncotypeDX 21-gene or other multigene assay). Adjuvant endocrine 
16 (85)

AstraZeneca
29, 15 June 2021
therapy is recommended following neo/adjuvant chemotherapy for all ER- and/or 
PgR-positive HER2-negative patients (ESMO 2019, NCCN Guidelines 2021). 
Standard neo/adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative early disease is an anthracycline 
alkylator, and taxane-containing regimen. The ESMO Guidelines (ESMO 2019) recommend 
that a sequential anthracycline/taxane-based regimen be standard for the majority of patients. 
The NCCN and ESMO guidelines consider there is insufficient evidence for the routine use of 
platinum in neoadjuvant regiments for TNBC patients. Whilst platinum compounds are not 
routinely recommended, the addition of a platinum compound may be considered in high risk 
TNBC patients with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations (ESMO 2019) and in select patients 
where better local control is desirable (NCCN Guidelines 2021). In high risk TNBC patients 
not achieving pathological CR after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the addition of 
adjuvant capecitabine post-operatively may be considered (ESMO 2019, NCCN Guidelines 
2021).
Recently the results from the OlympiA study have been incorporated into the NCCN 
guidelines as being recommended for high-risk breast cancer patients with HER2-negative 
disease and gBRCA mutation. The preferred regimen is 300 mg bd for 1 year (NCCN 
Guidelines 2021). In addition, the St Gallen guidelines have recommended that adjuvant 
olaparib for women with Stage II or III, HER2-negative cancers meeting the eligibility criteria 
of the OlympiA study should be considered for treatment with olaparib. These 
recommendations are irrespective of ER status or prior platinum chemotherapy treatment. 
Genetic testing for a confirmed gBRCA mutation is recommended (Burstein et al 2021).
Recently pembrolizumab has been approved in the US and is under review in the EU for the 
treatment of patients with high-risk early stage TNBC in combination with chemotherapy as 
neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after 
surgery (Keytruda USPI 2021).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity
Breast cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with 685,000 deaths. 
Among women, breast cancer represents 1 in 4 cancer cases and 1 in 6 cancer deaths, ranking 
first for incidence in the vast majority of countries (WHO Breast cancer 2021). Breast cancer 
incidence in transitioned nations is higher, while relative mortality is greatest in transitioning 
nations (Grundmann et al 2020). Globally, the mortality rates of breast cancer are lower 
compared to incidence rates (approximately 17.7 per 100,000 compared to 58.5 per 100,000, 
crude rate) due to the more favourable survival of breast cancer in transitioned nations. The 
EUROCARE-5 study reports the European mean age-standardised 5-year relative survival for 
breast cancer in women is 81.8% (De Angelis et al 2014). The WHO reported in 2020 that the 
17 (85)
EU RMP

29, 15 June 2021
breast cancer mortality in Europe was 141,765, and the crude rate 15.3 per 100,000 (WHO 
Cancer today 2020).
Nearly 30% of women with cancer confined to the breast and 75% of women with nodal 
involvement will ultimately relapse (Rosen et al 1989). 
The known earlier onset of BRCA1m and BRCA2m related breast cancer, as opposed to 
sporadic breast cancer, is consistent with the observation that BRCA mutations are associated 
with an aggressive biology and adverse prognostic impact (Atchley et al 2008). This early 
onset of breast cancer associated with gBRCA was also evidenced by the OlympiA trial 
population where the median age of study participants at the time of randomisation following 
completion of neo/adjuvant treatment in OlympiA was 42 years (Tutt et al 2021). In the 
French CANTO registry, women who were gBRCA1/2 carriers were diagnosed with primary 
breast cancer at an average age of 43.7 years (Bertaut et al 2021). A study based on the 
clinical database of the Danish Breast Cancer Group, reported that mean age at diagnosis was 
42 and 46 years for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, respectively (Soenderstrup et al 2017). 
Zhong et al, reported the mean age at breast diagnosis to be an average of 46.6 years for 
patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations and 49.7 years for patients with sBRCA mutations albeit in 
a non-European population (Zhong et al 2016).
BRCA1/2 breast cancer characteristics include high histological grade, continuous pushing 
margins, TP-53 mutations, loss of RAD51 focus information, extreme genomic instability and 
sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, with BRCA1 tumours additionally more frequently 
basal-like and ER-negative (Turner et al 2004). TNBC, which is more frequently associated 
with BRCA1m, generally has a poor prognosis despite high sensitivity to chemotherapy 
(Metzger-Filho et al 2012) with early recurrence between the first and third year after 
diagnosis, frequently in association with visceral and/or brain metastases and a shorter period 
between time of recurrence and death (Dent et al 2007). Within BRCAm tumours, the 
proportions with high-risk features are similar for each gene, regardless of the mutation being 
germline or somatic (Winter et al 2016). When compared to BRCA wildtype primary breast 
carcinomas, tumours harbouring a BRCA1/2 mutation (gBRCA1 n=10, gBRCA2 n=10, 
sBRCA1 n=4, sBRCA2 n=5), showed a higher proportion of patients with higher risk features 
including N1-N3, grade 3 tumours, ER/PR-negative disease and basal subtype 
(Winter et al 2016).
Breast cancer patients with a BRCA1 mutation frequently experience metastasis to lung and 
distant lymph nodes, and BRCA2 mutation carriers most often to bone and liver; the data also 
indicate that at least one-half of patients with BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated 
metastatic breast cancer will develop CNS metastases. Involvement of CNS and other 
non-CNS distant sites (relative to locoregional recurrence or contralateral disease) as first 
recurrence events were associated with increased mortality risk (Song et al 2020).

Important Co-morbidities:
AstraZeneca
29, 15 June 2021
The prevalence of co-morbidities among women treated for breast cancer is higher in the older 
population segment (≥66 years old): 32.2%, a statistic comparable to those without cancer at 
31.8%. A study with breast cancer survivors reported that the 5 most prevalent co-morbidities 
in this patient population were: hypertension (32.8%), arthritis (32.8%), thyroid problem 
(22.4%) hypercholesterolemia (12.7%), and diabetes (12.0%). Co-morbidities, specifically 
hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes, were associated with poorer quality of life in multiple 
domains among breast cancer survivors (Fu et al 2015). In a study published in 2019, the most 
prevalent baseline comorbidity reported was cardiovascular conditions (39.0%), followed by 
pain/pain-inflammation (34.8%) (Ng et al 2019).
II: 1.3
Pancreatic Cancer
Incidence
Pancreatic cancer was the thirteenth most frequent cancer worldwide with an estimated 
458,918 new cases diagnosed in 2018 (Bray et al 2018). Globally, age-standardised incidence 
rates (per 100,000 per year) were lowest in Africa (2.2) and highest in Europe (7.7) and North 
America (7.6) (Globocan 2018). In the US in 2019, pancreatic cancer is estimated to be the 
ninth most common newly diagnosed cancer (56,770 new cases) (American Cancer Society 
2021, Siegel et al 2018). In Europe in 2018, pancreatic cancer was estimated to be the ninth 
most common newly diagnosed cancer (132,559 new cases) (Globocan 2018). Current trends 
show increasing incidence in the US and Europe, particularly for younger adults (Wu et al 
2018, Rawla et al 2019). At least 50% of newly diagnosed pancreatic tumours are staged as 
metastatic (SEER Cancer Fact Sheet). 
Prevalence
Due to the very poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer with nearly as many deaths as new cases 
annually, the disease prevalence is low (Bray et al 2018). The estimated 5-year prevalence of 
pancreatic cancer in 2018 was 282,574 worldwide, with 32,692 prevalent cases in the US and 
79,268 cases in Europe (Globocan 2018).
Although carriers of loss of function germline mutations of the BRCA1 and particularly 
BRCA2 gene are known to have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer (Breast 
Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999, Goggins et al 1996), the prevalence of gBRCA mutations in 
the unselected cases of pancreatic cancer is unclear. Holter et al recently reported on a 
prospective analysis of the prevalence of gBRCA1/2 mutations in a cohort of 306 unselected 
patients with incident PDAC diagnoses and identified gBRCA mutations in ~5% of patients 
(Holter et al 2015). Furthermore, Shindo et al recently identified BRCA mutations in 1.8% of 
patients in a cohort of 854 patients with PDAC (Shindo et al 2017) and Blair et al identified 
BRCA mutations in 3.3% of patients in a cohort of 658 patients with resected sporadic PDAC 
(Blair et al 2018). There are specific populations, however, where the association is much 
19 (85)

stronger. In Ashkenazi Jewish patients with pancreatic cancer, the prevalence of gBRCA
mutations is 6% to 10% in unselected patients (Ferrone et al 2009, Ozcelik et al 1997Ozcelik 
et al 1997) and 15% in patients with a family history of the disease (Kim et al 2012). In 
pancreatic cancer patients with a family history of the disease, prevalence of carrying a 
germline BRCA2 mutation as high as 17% to 19% has been reported (Hahn et al 2003, Murthy 
and Muggia 2019).
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication and Risk Factors for the 
Disease
Pancreatic cancer incidence is higher for men than women and increases with age; the median 
age at diagnosis in the US is 70 years (Ferlay et al 2018a, SEER Cancer Fact Sheet). There is 
some evidence that patients carrying BRCA mutations are diagnosed at a younger age; 
however, results are not consistent (Bannon et al 2018, Holter et al 2015, Hu et al 2018, Toss 
et al 2019).
The causes of pancreatic cancer are not well understood. However, the strongest identified 
risk factors are tobacco smoking, family history of pancreatic cancer, heavy alcohol 
consumption, and Helicobacter pylori infection (Maisonneuve et al 2015, Rawla et al 2019). 
Additional potential risk factors include obesity, diabetes, non-O blood type, exposure to 
chemicals, chronic pancreatitis, and genetic predisposition, including BRCA germline 
mutations (Iqbal et al 2012, Maisonneuve et al 2015, Rawla et al 2019). Breast cancer 
susceptibility gene mutated cancer is more common among patients with a personal history of 
cancer or family history of several cancers, including pancreatic, or those of Ashkenazi Jewish 
heritage (Bannon et al 2018, Chaffee et al 2018, Holter et al 2015). 
The Main Existing Treatment Options
There are limited treatment options available for patients, surgery remains the only option for 
cure. The 2 preferred regimens for initial treatment of metastatic disease include the 
combination of 5-FU, irinotecan, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or gemcitabine 
in combination with nab paclitaxel (Ducreux et al 2015, NCCN 2019). Gemcitabine alone or 
in combination with erlotinib may also be used in the first line treatment setting (Sohal et al
2018). However, exacerbated toxicities are associated with combination platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimens (eg, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and sensory neuropathy; Conroy et al 
2011) which generally limit the number of cycles of treatment that can be given, meaning 
chemotherapy cannot generally be continued until disease progression.
Furthermore, few second line regimens are available for the treatment of patients with 
pancreatic cancer (American Cancer Society 2019), and these agents offer modest benefit 
(Rahma et al 2013). In 2015 in the US and 2016 in the EU, liposomal irinotecan (Onivyde™) 
was approved in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin, as second line treatment after 
progression following gemcitabine-based therapy for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma 
20 (85)

of the pancreas. 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin may be considered as second line 
treatment under certain circumstances, for patients who received gemcitabine plus nab 
paclitaxel as first line treatment, have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and a relatively 
favourable co morbidity profile (Ducreux et al 2015, Sohal et al 2018).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity
Pancreatic cancer is associated with a very poor prognosis. Worldwide in 2018, pancreatic 
cancer was estimated to be the seventh most common cause of cancer death (432,242 deaths) 
(Globocan 2018). Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death 
in Europe, accounting for 6.6% of all cancer deaths (Ferlay et al 2018a). In the US in 2019, 
pancreatic cancer is estimated to be the third most common cause of cancer death (45,750 
deaths) (American Cancer Society 2019, Siegel et al 2019). The proportion of cases diagnosed 
with localised, regional, or distant disease in the US is 10%, 29%, and 52%, respectively 
(therefore 80% of patients are diagnosed at an unresectable stage), and the 5 year survival rate 
for patients diagnosed with metastatic disease is only 3% (SEER Cancer Fact SheetAmerican 
Cancer Society 2019). In Europe, the overall 5-year survival is 6% to 10% and the median 
survival for patients with metastatic disease is 2.8 to 5.7 months (Bouvier et al 2017, Carrato 
et al 2015, Lepage et al 2015, Minicozzi et al 2018). Survival rates have not shown much 
improvement over the past several decades (Rawla et al 2019). There is some evidence that 
prognosis for BRCA mutation carriers is worse compared to those without mutations (Blair et 
al 2018, Ferrone et al 2009). The poor outcomes observed for pancreatic cancer are largely 
due to the late presentation of the disease as optimum screening tests have yet to be identified 
(McGuigan et al 2018). 
Important Co-morbidities:
Data related to comorbidity prevalence among pancreatic cancer patients, including those with 
BRCA mutations, are scarce. Common important co-morbidities expected in many older adults 
with cancer include hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, anaemia and diabetes (Williams et al 2016). Some comorbidities may be 
due to prior treatment.
II: 1.4
Prostate Cancer
Incidence
Prostate cancer is the second most common newly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, 
ranking as the fifth leading cause of cancer death among males (Globocan 2020). In the US 
and Europe, prostate cancer is the leading male cancer diagnosis, ranking as the second and 
third most common cause of cancer death, respectively (American Cancer Society 2021, 
Siegel et al 2021, ECIS 2020). In 2020, in the EU-27 countries, there were 335,514 newly 
diagnosed prostate cancer cases (ECIS 2020). In 2021, it is estimated that there will be 
21 (85)
EU RMP
Olaparib
AstraZeneca
29, 15 June 2021
248,530 newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases in the US (American Cancer Society 2021, 
Siegel et al 2021). 
Almost all patients in advanced stages will ultimately develop mCRPC, which progresses 
rapidly (Scher et al 2015). A systematic literature review identified that among patients with 
non-metastatic CRPC, nearly 60% developed metastatic disease during the first 5 years, with 
most of the metastases occurring within the first 3 years and one-third of patients developed 
bone metastases within 2 years (Kirby et al 2011). 
Prevalence
Improvements in screening, usually via prostate specific antigen testing and family history 
(Djulbegovic et al 2010), and decreases in mortality rates in many countries have led to an 
increase in the prevalence of prostate cancer worldwide (Bray et al 2018). The estimated 
five-year prevalence in 2018 was 3.7 million men worldwide, with a prevalence of 813,547 in 
North America and 1.5 million in Europe (Ferlay et al 2018b). Evidence on the prevalence of 
CRPC among men with prostate cancer has previously been estimated between 19% and 53% 
(Berruti et al 2007, Bianco et al 2003). 
Demographics of the Population in the Indication and Risk Factors for the Disease
Prostate cancer is generally a disease of older age, with most cases being diagnosed in men in 
their 60s and 70s (Pettersson et al 2018). The age-specific incidence has shifted in areas where 
screening has been commonly implemented, and men are more often being diagnosed in their 
50s and younger (Lowe et al 2003). In particular, in the US, African-American men and 
Jamaican men of African descent are more likely to develop prostate cancer than Caucasian 
men, and they are also more likely to be in an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis, with 
more aggressive high-grade tumours. A modest increase in prostate cancer risk is also 
associated with increasing body mass index (MacInnis et al 2006) as well as smoking 
(Huncharek et al 2010).
Genetic risk factors for prostate cancer have previously been identified; BRCA mutations are 
the most well-known. Prostate cancer in men with a germline BRCAm appears to occur at a 
younger age at presentation, has a more aggressive phenotype and is associated with 
significantly reduced survival times than in patients without a BRCAm (Castro et al 2013, 
NCCN 2019 Prostate). Other inherited factors are associated with 5% to 9% of prostate 
cancers (Hemminki and Czene 2002) with the risk being higher in patients with relatives who 
have been diagnosed with the disease (Bruner et al 2003, Kicinski et al 2011). Further, men 
with Lynch syndrome, a genetic , , occurring in ~1% of prostate cancers (NCCN 2019 
Prostate), have a 2- to 6-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer (Mohler et al 2019).

The Main Existing Treatment Options
AstraZeneca
29, 15 June 2021
Available therapy for patients with mCRPC in the US and EU includes docetaxel, 
enzalutamide, abiraterone, cabazitaxel, Radium-223, and olaparib. In the US, sipuleucel-T and 
rucaparib are also approved.
For patients who have not received prior treatment with docetaxel or an NHA, the preferred 
NCCN and ESMO regimens (NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines 2021, Parker et al 2020) for 
systemic treatment of M1 CRPC include abiraterone, docetaxel, and enzalutamide. 
Sipuleucel-T (Category 1; US only) is only recommended for specific patients. Abiraterone 
and enzalutamide remain preferred Category 1 NHAs after systemic treatment with docetaxel 
in the M1 CRPC disease state. A Category 1 designation signifies that, based upon high-level 
evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. 
New hormonal agents are potent, orally available treatment options with a favourable 
tolerability profile. Abiraterone and enzalutamide are authorised in the US and EU for the 
treatment of patients with mCRPC who have received prior chemotherapy containing 
docetaxel and also for use in the first-line metastatic (pre-chemotherapy) setting. Since their 
approval in the frontline setting, NHAs have increasingly replaced docetaxel globally as the 
preferred choice of first-line therapy for mCRPC (Flaig et al 2016, Parker et al 2020). 
Radium-223 is also used in certain circumstances in both frontline and later settings for bone 
metastases (Radium-223 is not recommended in combination with abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone/prednisolone or in patients with visceral metastases) and mitoxantrone can be used 
for palliation in symptomatic patients with visceral metastases who cannot tolerate other 
therapies.
All approved therapy options for frontline treatment of mCRPC are also available for later 
treatments. In addition, cabazitaxel and the PARP inhibitors olaparib (homologous 
recombination repair gene mutation [HRRm] patients in the US, BRCAm patients in the EU) 
and rucaparib (BRCAm patients in the US) are also approved as subsequent therapies for 
mCRPC. 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity 
Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among men worldwide with the 
burden expected to increase from 359,000 deaths in 2018 to 740,000 deaths by 2040. This is 
mostly attributed to the growth and aging of the population since almost 55% of all prostate 
cancer deaths occur after the age of 65 (Bray et al 2018). Mortality rates are highly variable 
worldwide, with the highest rates reported in Central America (10.7 per 100,000), and the 
lowest rates in Asia (South-Central [3.3], Eastern [4.7] and South-Eastern [5.4]) and Northern 
Africa [5.8]) (Ferlay et al 2018b).

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with a range of symptoms but is 
predominantly characterised by bone pain, fatigue, and urinary dysfunction (Gater et al 2011, 
Lindqvist et al 2008). Around 90% of patients with mCRPC have bone metastases (de Bono et 
al 2010, de Bono et al 2011, Scher et al 2012), which leads to significant morbidity, including 
pain and skeletal-related events such as spinal cord compression and pathological fractures, 
which require interventions such as bone surgery or radiation therapy (El-Amm et al 2013). 
Existing bone-targeted therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab) reduce the number of bone 
complications incompletely without a documented positive impact on OS (Saad et al 2004, 
Fizazi et al 2011). 
Prostate cancer is amenable to curative therapy if detected early; however, advanced stages 
are life-threatening. Surgical or medical castration is the mainstay of therapy for advanced 
prostate cancer. However, many diagnosed patients will eventually experience disease 
progression, and castration-resistant prostate cancer ensues. Once prostate cancer becomes 
castration resistant and progresses to a metastatic stage the disease is not curable (median 
survival ranges from 9 -13 months), and treatment must focus on extending life, delaying 
disease progression and improving quality of life (Kirby et al 2011). Additionally, mCRPC 
patients with a homologous recombination repair gene mutation (such as BRCA2) have been 
generally shown to have a poorer prognosis compared with an unselected population (Castro 
et al 2019).
Important Co-morbidities
Co-morbidities associated with prostate cancer are linked with race, stage, and age at 
diagnosis (Xiao et al 2013, Evans et al 2008). Analysis of data from a US population-based 
cancer registry showed that, out of 60,497 patients with prostate cancer identified, the most 
prevalent co-morbidities were hypertension (42.3%), genitourinary system disease (24.4%), 
endocrine, nutritional/metabolic and immunity disorders (19.29%), digestive system disease 
(15.23%), ischemic heart disease (13.86%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disease 
(11.75%), and diabetes (10.46%) (Xiao et al 2013). 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important co-morbidity occurring in 1% to 2% of 
patients with prostate cancer (, ). The risk of VTE increases almost three-fold during the first 
year and doubles during the second through fifth years after diagnosis of prostate cancer, and 
is higher in older patients, those with metastases, those with high Gleason scores, and those 
who underwent surgery (Ording et al 2015). In men on ADT, the incidence of 
thromboembolic disease increases with the duration of therapy and the risk is highest for those 
who switched regimen, suggesting that both disease progression and ADT contribute to the 
propagation of risk of thromboembolic disease (O’Farrell et al 2016).

MODULE SII: NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
II: 2.1
Summary of Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical Data
Toxicity
Key Issues Identified from Acute Repeat Dose Toxicity Studies
The principal target organ for toxicity following repeat dosing for up to 6 months was the 
bone marrow, with associated changes in peripheral haematology parameters in both rats and 
dogs. All haematological changes seen in rats and dogs in the 1-month studies showed full or 
partial reversibility following a 28-day recovery period. Steady-state exposures at the highest 
dose levels used in the repeat-dose rat and dog toxicity studies were notably lower than those 
achieved in humans at the recommended clinical dose.
Studies using human bone marrow cells demonstrated that direct exposure to olaparib can 
result in toxicity to bone marrow cells in ex vivo assays.
Subsequent postmarketing experience/clinical practice has provided sufficient rationale to 
exclude this finding as a safety concern for olaparib.
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
In female rats, although conception rates were unaffected by pre- and peri-conception dosing, 
embryofoetal survival was decreased. In embryofoetal development studies in rats, olaparib 
caused reductions in early embryofoetal survival and foetal weights at exposures that did not 
induce significant maternal toxicity and were significantly lower than those achieved in 
humans at the efficacious clinical dose. 
These reproductive and development toxicity data indicate that olaparib may cause foetal 
harm in women of child bearing potential. Effects on embryofoetal survival and abnormal 
development is included in this RMP as an important potential risk for olaparib.
Genotoxicity
Olaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation test (Ames), but was clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration test in vitro and induced micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats 
following oral dosing.
Genotoxicity has the potential to lead to the development of new malignancies and adversely 
affect embryofoetal survival and development. MDS/AML, other new primary malignancies 
and effects on embryofoetal survival and abnormal development are included in this RMP as 
either important identified or potential risks for olaparib.

MODULE SIII: CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE

Clinical Trial Exposure
II: 3.1.1 Overview of Olaparib Clinical Programme
As of 15 June 2021, an estimated 17,923 patients with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, prostate, 
gastric or a variety of other solid tumours had received treatment with olaparib in 
monotherapy and combination therapy, including AstraZeneca sponsored studies, 
AstraZeneca-Merck Alliance sponsored and investigator sponsored/collaborative studies.
Data in this section are presented from the monotherapy all doses pool, consisting of patients 
who have received olaparib monotherapy treatment at any dose in AstraZeneca-Merck 
Alliance sponsored monotherapy studies (N=4464) (see Table II-6 to Table II-13below).
Data in Section II: 7.3 are presented for the monotherapy therapeutic dose pool, which 
consists of patients who have received olaparib capsules at the therapeutic dose of 400 mg bd 
and patients who were intended to receive the tablet formulation of olaparib at a dose of 
300 mg bd as a monotherapy and who received olaparib treatment (N=4098). This pool is 
used to characterise the important identified risk of MDS/AML, and the important potential 
risk of NPMs. For studies included in the therapeutic dose pool see footnote 1 in this section 
under capsule and tablet studies.
Exposure data is also presented for the PAOLA-1 study, for olaparib in combination with 
bevacizumab (see Table II-4 to Table II-5 below).
Pooled exposure data is presented for the PROpel study and Study 8, for olaparib in 
combination with abiraterone (see Table II-1, Table II-2, and Table II-3).

information
Rationale for NOT being missing 
information
Data from studies D0816C00007 and 
D0816C00008 have provided 
evidence of altered olaparib exposure 
in patients concomitantly treated with 
strong inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4. The possible outcome of 
this drug-drug interaction is increased 
toxicity or reduced efficacy, 
respectively. Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
includes wording to reduce the dose 
of olaparib if a strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitor must be co-
administered, as well as a warning 
that Lynparza co-administration with 
strong or moderate CYP3A inducers 
may result in a substantial reduction 
in the efficacy of Lynparza. 
Considering the available data and the 
warnings and precautions provided in 
the SmPC, this utilisation is not 
considered missing information.
No
CYP3A4/5 have been shown to 
be the major isozymes 
responsible for the metabolism 
of olaparib in vitro. Strong 
inhibitors of cytochrome 
CYP3A4 have the potential to 
increase olaparib exposure and 
hence toxicity due to 
interaction. Strong inducers of 
cytochrome CYP3A4 have the 
potential to decrease olaparib 
exposure and hence to decrease 
efficacy of olaparib.

To ensure interpretation of 
safety and efficacy findings 
were not confounded by the 
presence of pre-existing QTc 
prolongation.
Data from studies D0816C00004 and 
D0816C00007 showed that no 
clinically relevant effect on the QTc 
interval was observed after single 
(300 mg and 100 mg, respectively) or 
multiple (300 mg) oral dosing of 
olaparib tablet. Therefore, a different 
safety profile to that characterised for 
the general target population is not 
anticipated in this population.
Administration to this population is 
not expected due to wording on 
haematological toxicity in Section 4.4 
of the SmPC. Considering these

Patients with serum bilirubin

PK data were available in 
hepatically impaired patients.
Patients with serum creatinine 
>1.5 times ULN were 
excluded, as no safety or PK 
data were available in renally 
impaired patients.
Data from study D0816C00005 
provides evidence that Lynparza can 
be administered to patients with mild 
or moderate hepatic impairment with 
no dose adjustments. The study of 
patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is neither feasible nor 
warranted. Consequently use in this 
patient population is not classified as 
an area of missing information.
Data from study D0816C00006
provides evidence that Lynparza can 
be administered to patients with mild 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
51 to 80 ml/min), with no dose 
adjustments.
The posology section of the SmPC 
states that the dose of Lynparza for 
patients with moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 
31 to 50 ml/min) should be reduced.
The study of patients with severe 
renal impairment and end stage renal 
disease is neither feasible nor 
warranted.
Consequently use in this patient 
population is not classified as an area 
of missing information.
Use in this population is not expected 
as the SmPC states that Lynparza 
should not be used during pregnancy 
due to the potential for embryofoetal 
toxicity identified in nonclinical 
studies; embryofoetal survival and 
development is an important potential 
risk. Considering these factors, use in 
this population is not classified as an 
area of missing information.
Breast feeding during olaparib 
treatment, and for 1 month after 
receiving the last dose, is 
contraindicated, therefore this

MODULE SV: POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE
II: 5.1.1 Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The post-marketing patient exposure data presented is estimated based on olaparib’s monthly 
actual ex-factory sales volume from each local marketing company. These data represent all 
olaparib formulations delivered to various distribution channels (for example wholesalers, 
pharmacies etc) worldwide.
The sales volume is provided as the number of individual capsules/tablets sold as of 
31 May 2021. For olaparib capsules, the estimated post-marketing patient exposure data for 
the reporting period is an approximation based on the assumption that each patient took 
16 capsules of olaparib a day. Therefore, a patient-year worth of exposure is calculated by 
multiplying 16 capsules per day by 365 days (5840 capsules per patient-year).
For olaparib tablets, the estimated post-marketing patient exposure data for the reporting 
period is an approximation based on the assumption that each patient took 4 tablets of olaparib 
a day. Therefore, a patient-year worth of exposure is calculated by multiplying 4 tablets per 
day by 365 days (1460 tablets per patient-year).
The current methodology does not distinguish between sales that are related to initial 
prescriptions versus those related to repeat prescriptions. Therefore, it is not possible to 
estimate the number of patients exposed to olaparib. More detailed patient-level data 
(eg, gender, ethnicity, age category, off-label use, specific populations etc) are not available
Exposure
II: 5.1.2
The cumulative global post-marketing patient exposure for olaparib capsules and olaparib 
tablets since launch (24 December 2014) through to 31 May 2021 has been estimated to be

Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks and 
Missing Information
Data presented for MDS/AML and NPMs are based on the monotherapy therapeutic dose 
pool; this consists of patients who have received olaparib capsules at the therapeutic dose of 
400 mg bd and patients who were intended to receive the tablet formulation of olaparib at a 
dose of 300 mg bd as a monotherapy and who received olaparib treatment (N=3988). Data are 
presented for events that occurred up to the final DCO for studies within the pool.
In the majority of studies MDS/AML and the development of NPMs was actively solicited 
beyond the 30 day follow-up period, regardless of causality assessment; however, in the 
POLO study, these events were not actively solicited after the 30-day follow-up period and 
were not captured in the POLO study database although, where reported, they were captured 
in the AstraZeneca Patient Safety database.
Presentation of Important Identified Risks
II: 7.3.1
Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
Potential Mechanisms
The pathogenesis of MDS and AML is not completely understood, but like other cancers 
involves the stepwise acquisition of oncogenic driver mutations. MDS and AML are clonal 
processes that are thought to develop from a single transformed hematopoietic progenitor cell 
(Walter et al 2012, Will et al 2012, Woll et al 2014). In MDS, studies suggest that the cell of 
origin has acquired multiple mutations resulting in dysplasia and ineffective haematopoiesis, 
therefore, the cytopenias and myelosuppression are an effect and consequence of the 
underlying disease (MDS), rather than a cause of the disease (Pang et al 2013). Olaparib is not 
mutagenic in the Ames test. Olaparib does demonstrate clastogenicity in vitro in a Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell assay and in vivo micronuclei in the bone marrow of 
rats, but the positive result in these studies could be expected due to the non-repair of 
replication errors occurring at a natural rate during cell division. Treatment with PARP 
inhibitors, which leads to the accumulation of DNA damage in some cells and apoptosis, 
could potentially contribute to the development of new primary malignancies, including 
MDS/AML, by creating genomic instability in the absence of apoptosis (see also New primary 
malignancies – Potential mechanisms section).
47 (85)
EU RMP
Olaparib
AstraZeneca
29, 15 June 2021
MDS/AML usually occurs years after cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy which, 
beside the direct induction of DNA damage, raises the role of genetic predisposition and also a 
stochastic occurrence of a second cancer. McNerney et al suggest that chemotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy directly promote clonal selection of pre-existing mutant haematopoietic stem 
cells (McNerney et al 2017). There are instances where blood cells contain somatic mutations 
of genes known to be recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies (frequently referred to 
as clonal haematopoiesis) with absence of morphological evidence of disease. Recently, 
Bolton et al investigated the relationship between clonal haematopoiesis and PARP inhibitor 
therapy and found that patients exposed to PARP inhibitor therapy were more likely to have 
clonal haematopoiesis (33%), particularly those in the DNA damage response pathway 
compared to those exposed to other systemic therapies or radiation (18%), or untreated 
patients (16%) (Bolton et al 2020).
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
Case reports of MDS/AML have been received from clinical studies and through spontaneous 
reporting.

Seriousness/Outcome: All reports of MDS/AML are medically significant and therefore serious
In 21 of the 34 cases of MDS/AML in the monotherapy therapeutic dose pool a fatal outcome was reported, with MDS/AML recorded as the primary or 
secondary cause of death. The time to death after olaparib was discontinued ranged from 20 to 1109 days (median 311 days). In 3 of the 21 fatal cases, patients 
died due to disease progression secondary to AML or MDS. In 10 of the 34 cases, MDS/AML was ongoing at the time of reporting, and in 3 cases the 
outcome was reported as recovered.
Nature of risk (Olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool cases n=34):
The incidence of MDS/AML in patients treated in clinical trials with Lynparza monotherapy, including long-term survival follow-up, was <1.5%, with higher 
incidence in patients with BRCAm PSR ovarian cancer who had received at least 2 prior lines of platinum chemotherapy and were followed up for 5 years. The 
majority of events had a fatal outcome. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients who developed MDS/AML varied from <6 months to 4 years. All 
patients had potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML, having received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents. Many had also 
received other DNA damaging treatments. The majority of reports were in gBRCA mutation carriers and some of the patients had a history of more than one 
primary malignancy or of bone marrow dysplasia. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with Lynparza, it is recommended that Lynparza 
should be discontinued and the patient be treated appropriately.

Important Identified Risk: Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
Overall in monotherapy and combination studies (N=7161), there were 2954 (41.3%) patients with gBRCA1 mutation of whom 40/2954 (1.4%) had 
MDS/AML and 1516 (21.2%) patients with gBRCA2 mutation of whom 14/1516 (0.9%) had MDS/AML.
Considering the estimated overall exposure to olaparib in clinical trials (including ongoing monotherapy and combination studies), ESR, and a MAP of 
17,923 patients at 15 June 2021, and assuming that patients whose treatment remains blinded are receiving olaparib, the estimated overall incidence of 
MDS/AML in clinical trials and MAP is 96/17,923 (0.5%).
Combination data
Olaparib in combination with bevacizumab
The frequency and nature of MDS/AML in the PAOLA-1 study was similar to that observed in olaparib monotherapy studies. All four patients had received 
multiple cycles of previous chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/paclitaxel in combination with bevacizumab). Death in the two fatal cases 
occurred 262 days and 450 days after the last dose of olaparib. The duration of MDS/AML in the patient who recovered was 381 days; olaparib had been 
discontinued due to the event.
Olaparib in combination with abiraterone
No events of MDS/AML were reported in the olaparib + abiraterone pool.

Risk Factors and Risk Groups
Risk factors include prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or irradiation, 
occupational exposure, and smoking (Strom et al 2008). Secondary MDS/AML occurs as a 
late toxicity of cancer treatment, usually following exposure to alkylating agents such as 
cyclophosphamide, melphalan or platinum agents (cisplatin, carboplatin) or concurrent 
radiation with a latent period of 5 to 7 years, or the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors (shorter 
latency period of 2 years) (Leone et al 1999, Travis et al 1999). Both acquired aplastic 
anaemia following immunosuppressive treatment and genetic Fanconi anaemia can evolve 
into MDS. Patients with Fanconi anaemia have a higher risk of MDS and AML (Kutler et al 
2003). There is some evidence that the risk of MDS/AML may be increased in patients with 
BRCA mutation (Friedenson 2007, Cole and Strair 2010), but there is not sufficient published 
data to quantify this risk due to the rarity of the event and historical lack of routine BRCA 
mutation screening. Germline BRCA mutation is known to predispose patients to the 
development of solid tumours, notably ovarian and breast tumours and Cole and Strair have 
hypothesised that a deficiency in the expression of BRCA genes may also render patients more 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of chemotherapy and therefore put them at an increased risk 
of MDS/AML (Cole and Strair 2010).
Preventability
No data are available on preventability.
Section 4.4 of the SmPC provides advice to prescribers on the avoidance and management of 
haematological toxicity caused by previous anti-cancer therapy.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
MDS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Morbidity is related to the degree 
of cytopenia and may include hospital admissions for bleeding episodes, infections and 
transfusion dependent anaemia. Mortality is mainly due to neutropenic sepsis and 
transformation to AML.
Public Health Impact
There is no public health impact.
II: 7.3.2
New Primary Malignancies
Presentation of Important Potential Risks
Potential Mechanisms
The observation that secondary cancers are linked to treatment with DNA damaging agents, 
raises the potential risk that treatment with PARP inhibitors, which lead to the accumulation 
of DNA damage in some cells, could also contribute to the development of these conditions 
by creating genomic instability. PARP inhibition does not directly cause DNA damage but 
impairs the ability of cells to repair DNA single strand breaks and, in cells that have a 
51 (85)

deficient homologous recombination pathway, this leads to the accumulation of un-repaired 
double strand breaks that eventually cause the death of the target cell. Normal cells, even 
those from patients with a gBRCA mutation and only one functional BRCA allele in all cells, 
would be expected to have an intact homologous recombination DNA repair mechanism and 
therefore be able to adequately repair the double strand breaks induced by inhibiting PARP. 
However, the overall burden of single and double strand breaks will be increased in all 
dividing cells by PARP inhibition and this is the basis for the potential risk that this may 
contribute to the development of second primary cancers.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
Case reports of NPMs have been received from clinical studies and post-marketing use.

Of the 44 AEs (reported in 42 patients) in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool, the reported malignancies were: breast cancers (n=18), 
gastrointestinal cancers (n=8), thyroid cancer (n=4), lung cancer (n=3), malignant melanoma (n=2), bladder cancer, Burkitt lymphoma, endometrial 
adenocarcinoma, glioma, lip and/or oral cavity cancer, lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, and squamous cell 
carcinoma of the tongue (n=1 of each). Of the 42 patients in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool with new primary malignancies, 35 patients had a 
documented BRCA mutation, 3 patients were gBRCA wildtype and in 4 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown.
Nature of risk:
Of the 42 olaparib patients in the monotherapy therapeutic dose pool, the diagnosis of NPM, in the majority of patients (n=27) was made whilst the patient was 
still receiving olaparib and in the majority of cases (n=16) olaparib was continued. Time from cancer diagnosis, to onset of secondary cancers was generally 
several years and overlapped with time when patients were receiving olaparib.
Overall in monotherapy and combination studies (N=7161), there were 2954 (41.3%) patients with gBRCA1 mutation of whom 75/2954 (2.5%) had NPM and 
1516 (21.2%) patients with gBRCA2 mutation of whom 25/1516 (1.6%) had NPM.

Important Potential Risk: New Primary Malignancies
Considering the estimated overall exposure to olaparib in clinical trials (including ongoing monotherapy and combination studies), ESR, and the MAP of 
17,923 patients at 15 June 2021 and assuming that patients whose treatment remains blinded are receiving olaparib, the estimated overall incidence of NPM in 
clinical trials and MAP is 115/17,923 (0.6%). 
Patients from all sources had other potential factors that offer alternative explanations for the development of the new primary tumour including documented 
BRCA mutation, previous treatment with various chemotherapy agents including multiple cycles of platinum containing chemotherapies and treatment with 
taxanes, anthracyclines and other alkylating and DNA-damaging agents. Some patients had received radiotherapy and some had medical histories of previous 
cancers including ovarian, cervical, breast and peritoneal carcinoma. A number of patients with new primary skin cancers had either previous basal cell 
carcinoma or skin lesions evident prior to study treatment.
Combination data 
Olaparib in combination with bevacizumab
The frequency in the PAOLA-1 study was slightly higher than that observed in olaparib monotherapy studies. All 13 patients had received multiple cycles of 
previous chemotherapy (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/paclitaxel in combination with bevacizumab). Time to onset ranged from 194 days to 1126 days 
(median 747 days; approximately 25 months). Of the 3 fatal cases, 2 were due to breast cancer and 1 due to acute lymphocytic leukaemia.
Olaparib in combination with abiraterone
The frequency in the olaparib + abiraterone pool is slightly higher than that observed in olaparib monotherapy studies. Time to onset ranged from 89 days to

Risk Factors and Risk Groups
Patients with ovarian cancer, breast cancer and BRCA mutations are at risk of developing 
other common cancers (Bergfeldt et al 1995, Fowble et al 2001, Wesolowski et al 2007). 
Therapy induced risk factors, including previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy with DNA 
damaging agents, are known to increase the incidence of malignant disease (eg, bladder 
cancer, lymphoma and leukaemia).
Other common risk factors include: 
Exposure to ultraviolet-light which can induce DNA damage, causing skin cancer
Exposure to environmental factors eg, formaldehyde, asbestos


 Dietary factors in cancer of colon and breast 
 Hormonal factors eg, oestrogen dependent (endometrial and breast cancers) 
Smoking, which has been connected to several types of cancer eg, lung

Immunological factors: some cancer patients have depressed immunological function and 

certain states of immunosuppression can predispose for specific malignant disease.
Preventability
Good medical care and screening can help detect new cancers early. Appropriate attention to 
potential symptoms and prompt action will contribute to controlling the risk. 
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
Cancer is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and therefore if confirmed, it 
could potentially impact benefit risk. The reported incidence of new primary malignancies in 
the olaparib programme is low and consistent with the observed incidence in epidemiological 
data of patients treated for advanced ovarian and breast cancer.
Public Health Impact
There is no public health impact.
Effects on Embryofoetal Survival and Abnormal Development
Potential Mechanisms
Based on its mechanism of action (PARP inhibition), Lynparza could cause effects on 
embryofoetal survival and abnormal development.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence
Nonclinical studies in rats have shown that olaparib causes adverse effects on embryofoetal
survival and induces major foetal malformations at exposures below those expected at the 
recommended human dose of 300 mg bd. Olaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation 
test (Ames), but was clastogenic in a chromosome aberration test in vitro and induced 
micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats following oral dosing.

During OlympiA, 2 pregnancies occurred on olaparib treatment or within 3 months after the last dose of study intervention. Both pregnancies were carried to 
full term and resulted in a healthy baby. 
In addition to the 2 cases from OlympiA, based on a search of the AstraZeneca safety database up to 15 June 2021, there have been 8 other reports of exposure 
during pregnancy for olaparib as detailed below:
1 report concerned possible exposure to olaparib via the inhaled route in a manufacturing facility; the subject subsequently delivered a healthy baby boy.
1 report, from an externally sponsored study, concerned a patient who had a spontaneous abortion (at approximately 9 weeks), following 33 days of treatment 
with olaparib 150 mg bd. Olaparib commenced 12 days after a negative urine pregnancy test. IV paclitaxel and carboplatin were administered around the same 
time as olaparib (35 days and 51 days duration, respectively), and granulocyte colony stimulating factor was started on an unknown date.
The remaining 6 reports came from spontaneous sources for which there is limited detail:
•
2 cases possibly concerned the same patient (patients had same date of birth and the information provided was almost identical - in one report the 
patient's doctor's office reported that the patient was no longer on medication due to being pregnant, and in the other the patient stated she had been on 
the medication in the past and stopped due to getting pregnant with no further information provided). 
1 report stated that the patient was in week 9 of pregnancy and was being treated with Lynparza for breast cancer. No further information was provided.
The remaining 3 spontaneous reports were possibly reported in error as none included any information on pregnancy:

In 1 report the patient was a 73-year-old female, 
•
•


1 report was invalid (no patient identifiers),
1 report of ‘depressed system’ in a 48-year-old patient.
Severity and nature of risk
Based on findings from reproductive toxicity studies, it is considered that olaparib has the potential to cause serious teratogenic effects and foetal loss in 
humans, if used during pregnancy.
a
Cases involving exposure during pregnancy, included spontaneous reports and clinical trial cases from unblinded studies. Data are provided to a DCO of

Preventability
Section 4.4 of the SmPC provides wording which states that Lynparza should not be used 
during pregnancy and provides advice on contraception for female and male patients. 
Cautionary statements have also been made in the SmPC in Section 4.6 ‘Fertility, pregnancy 
and lactation’.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product
Exposure to olaparib during pregnancy has the potential to have serious consequences such as 
severe foetal developmental abnormalities or loss of the pregnancy, and could therefore 
impact benefit risk.
Public Health Impact
There is no public health impact.

This is a summary of the RMP for Lynparza. The RMP details important risks of Lynparza, 
how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Lynparza's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Lynparza's SmPC and its PL give essential information to healthcare professionals and 
patients on how Lynparza should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Lynparza should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the EPAR. 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Lynparza's RMP.

THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Lynparza is a PARP (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase) inhibitor. PARP 
inhibitors destroy cancer cells by exploiting deficiencies in DNA pathways. These specific 
cancer cells can be identified by response to platinum chemotherapy or by looking for faulty 
(mutated) DNA repair genes, such as BRCA (BReast CAncer) genes.
Lynparza is authorised, as monotherapy, for the maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated 
relapsed ovarian, cancer, once the cancer has responded to platinum-based chemotherapy, and 
for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed advanced BRCA-
mutated ovarian cancer, who are in response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
Lynparza is also authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline 
BRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with 
chemotherapy. These patients could have received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant 
or metastatic setting (see SmPC for the full indications). Patients with HR-positive breast 
cancer should also have progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy, or be considered 
unsuitable for endocrine therapy (see SmPC for the full indications).
Lynparza is also used as monotherapy or in combination with endocrine therapy for the 
adjuvant treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations who have HER2-
negative, high risk early breast cancer previously treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy. 
Lynparza is also used as monotherapy for treatment of a type of pancreatic cancer (BRCA
mutated), that has responded to the first treatment with standard platinum-based 
chemotherapy. A test is used to find out whether you have BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer.
Lynparza is also used as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations (germline and/or somatic) who 
have progressed following prior therapy that included new hormonal agent.
Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is used for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with advanced high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal 
cancer who are in response (complete response or partial response) following completion of 
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated 
with HRD positive status defined by either a BRCA1/2 mutation and/or genomic instability.
Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone is used for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in 
whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.
The tablets contain Lynparza as the active substance and are given by oral administration.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS
Important risks of Lynparza, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Lynparza's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In the case of Lynparza, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under the relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lynparza is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
VI: 2.1
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Lynparza are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lynparza. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information

Summary of Important Risks
Table VI-2
Important Identified Risks
MDS/AML
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Case reports of MDS/AML have been received from clinical studies and 
through spontaneous reporting. 
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk factors include prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or 
irradiation, occupational exposure, and smoking (Strom et al 2008). 
Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment, usually with a 
combination of radiation and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as 
bisulfan or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5 to 7 years) or the DNA 
topoisomerase inhibitors (2 years). Both acquired aplastic anaemia following 
immunosuppressive treatment and genetic Fanconi anaemia can evolve into 
MDS. Patients with Fanconi anaemia have a higher risk of MDS and AML 
(Kutler et al 2003). There is some evidence that the risk of MDS/AML may 
be increased in patients with BRCA mutation (Friedenson 2007, Cole and 
Strair 2010), but there is not sufficient published data to quantify this risk due 
to the rarity of the event and historical lack of routine BRCA mutation 
screening. Germline BRCA mutation is known to predispose patients to the 
development of solid tumours, notably ovarian and breast tumours and Cole 
and Strair have hypothesised that a deficiency in the expression of BRCA
genes may also render patients more vulnerable to the adverse effects of 
chemotherapy and therefore put them at an increased risk of MDS/AML 
(Cole and Strair 2010). Recently, Bolton et al investigated the relationship 
between clonal haematopoiesis and PARP inhibitor therapy and found that 
patients exposed to PARP inhibitor therapy were more likely to have clonal 
haematopoiesis (33%), particularly those in the DNA damage response 
pathway compared to those exposed to other systemic therapies or radiation 
(18%), or untreated patients (16%) (Bolton et al 2020).
Overall in monotherapy and combination studies (N=7161), there were 
2594 (41.3%) patients with gBRCA1 mutation of whom 40/2954 (1.4%) had 
MDS/AML and 1516 (21.2%) patients with gBRCA2 mutation of whom 
14/1516 (0.9%) had MDS/AML.

New primary malignancies
Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with ovarian cancer, breast cancer and BRCA mutations are at risk of 
developing other common cancers (Bergfeldt et al 1995, Fowble et al 2001, 
Wesolowski et al 2007). Therapy induced risk factors, including previous 
radiotherapy or chemotherapy with DNA damaging agents, are known to 
increase the incidence of malignant disease (eg, bladder cancer, lymphoma 
and leukaemia).
Other common risk factors include: 
•
•
•
•
•
•
Exposure to ultraviolet-light which can induced DNA damage, causing 
skin cancer
Exposure to environmental factors eg, formaldehyde, asbestos
Dietary factors in cancer of colon and breast 
Hormonal factors eg, oestrogen dependent (endometrial and breast 
cancers) 
Smoking, which has been connected to several types of cancer eg, lung
Immunological factors: some cancer patients have depressed 
immunological function and certain states of immunosuppression can
predispose for specific malignant disease.
Overall in monotherapy and combination studies (N=7161), there were 
2954 (41.3%) patients with gBRCA1 mutation of whom 75/2954 (2.5%) had 
NPM and 1516 (21.2%) patients with gBRCA2 mutation of whom 
25/1516 (1.6%) had NPM.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Nonclinical studies in rats have shown that Lynparza causes adverse effects 
on embryofoetal survival and induces major foetal malformations at 
exposures below those expected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg 
bd. Lynparza was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation test (Ames), but was 
clastogenic in a chromosome aberration test in vitro and induced micronuclei 
in the bone marrow of rats following oral dosing.

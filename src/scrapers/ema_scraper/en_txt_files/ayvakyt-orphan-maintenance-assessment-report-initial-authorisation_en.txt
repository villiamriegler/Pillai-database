COMP opinion (adoption via written 
29 July 2020 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2017 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing avapritinib was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data demonstrating that patients affected by the 
condition respond to treatment; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to the high rate of 
relapse and development of metastatic disease resulting in a poor survival; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in 
the European Union (EU), the Sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that 
the medicinal product containing avapritinib will be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data that demonstrated clinical responses 
in patients, who have relapsed or were refractory after treatment with best standard of care 
including authorised products. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are non-epithelial tumours of mesenchymal origin that arise 
predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). 
GIST is thought to develop from the interstitial cells of Cajal or their stem cell precursors that are 
located in the myenteric plexus of the GI tract. In 85% cases of GIST, tumour behaviour is driven by 
KIT mutations. C-kit receptor tyrosine kinase gene encodes for a transmembrane receptor. GIST is 
most common in the stomach (60-70%), followed by the small intestine (20-30%), and then the colon 
and rectum (5%). GIST is associated with several gene mutations. 
The median age of diagnosis of GIST is 60-65 years and is most commonly diagnosed between the 
ages of 50 and 80 years. GIST rarely occurs in the paediatric population (<1%) and in this age group, 
tumours may have a different pathogenesis than adult GIST as neither KIT nor PDGFRα mutations 
seem to be present.

Page 4/10 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common symptom at presentation is bleeding. Patients with GIST may also have various 
other symptoms, such as abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, bloating, obstructive jaundice, 
dysphagia, fever and anaemia-related symptoms such as fatigue and palpitations, or they may present 
with an abdominal tumour with no symptoms. Between 10% and 25% of patients present with 
metastatic disease. GIST often remains clinically silent until tumours reach a large size, when mass 
effects, bleeding, or rupture may ensue. 
The COMP continues to designate this condition. 
The proposed therapeutic indication “Ayvakyt® is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “Treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed on the 23 July 2020 by a CHMP positive benefit/risk 
assessment. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition is known to be life threatening with a median overall survival of < 5 years in locally 
advanced or metastatic GIST. Survival has, however, improved with the authorisation of imatinib: in 
the pre-imatinib period 1990-1998, the 12 months and 5-year survival rates for GIST patients were 
respectively 81.5% and 48%; in the period 1999-2005, the 12 months and 5-year survival rates 
increased to 86.4% and 63.1%, respectively, and further improved in the period 2006-2011 being 
89.7% and 69%, respectively.  
The COMP continues to consider the condition to be chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in 
particular due to the high rate of relapse and development of metastatic disease resulting in a poor 
survival. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
It was noted by the COMP that most of the cancer registries searched classified cancers by site and do 
not mention GIST in their reports or public information. 
To overcome this, two approaches to the prevalence calculation have been provided. 
• 
• 
The first is a literature search to establish the reported prevalence in different Member States. 
The second considers the incidence reported in the literature and offers a calculation based on the 
overall survival of the patients using the equation of incidence X duration (years) = prevalence.  
Overall, 16 data sources were found reporting GIST incidence and 2 data sources reported GIST 
prevalence (Norway and the UK). From these 2 data sources, the estimates ranged from 0.8 per 
10,000 in Norway to 1.5 per 10,000 population in the UK, with the upper 95% CI limits at 1.2 and 2 
per 10,000 population in Norway and the UK, respectively.

Among the studies reporting incidence, most had a regional or country level focus, with only one study 
including data from several European countries (Stiller et al, 2013). The sponsor states that only data 
sources that provided European age-adjusted estimates for comparability purposes were selected.  In 
order  to  estimate  prevalence  from  incidence,  the  sponsor  used  survival  data  for  GIST  with  localized 
disease at diagnosis (median OS of 14.5 years). Following this logic, the estimated prevalence could be 
considered as the maximum prevalence possible for the disease. This was accepted by the COMP. 
From the data submitted by the sponsor it can be seen that in general the reported prevalence and 
incidence of the condition are highly variable and in a range of 0.1 to 2.8 in 10,000. 
In the current ESMO Guideline a publication from Sweden in 2005 indicated that the incidence was 0.1 
in 10,000. (Nilsson B, Bumming P, Meis-Kindblom JM et al. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours: the 
incidence, prevalence, clinical course, and prognostication in the preimatinib mesylate era–a 
population-based study in western Sweden. Cancer 2005; 103: 821–829.). 
In conclusion the incidence is reported from 0.1 to 2.1 in 100.000, with the most recent publications 
providing estimates of approx. 1.5 in 100.000. The sponsor initially introduced age-standardisation into 
the calculation which lowers the estimate for the incidence, to which the COMP did not agree. In a 
written procedure the sponsor submitted a revised non-age-standardised prevalence calculation which 
estimated that the prevalence was 3.1 in 10,000. The COMP rounded this off to 3 in 10,000 and 
accepted this final figure for the purpose of maintaining the orphan designation. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor indicated that no new products have been authorised since the original designation in 
2017. The following products have an approval in the EU:

Current ESMO Guidelines on this condition were released in 2018 (Casali, Ann of Oncol. 2018; 29 (S4): 
iv68–78. 
The standard treatment of localised GIST is complete surgical excision of the lesion, with no dissection 
of clinically negative lymph nodes. 
For advanced forms the following algorithm is recommended.

considered if previously treated with 400 mg imatinib. BSC, best supportive care; GIST, 
gastrointestinal stromal tumour; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; SD, stable 
disease; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
Imatinib is the standard treatment for locally advanced inoperable and metastatic disease, as well as 
for patients previously treated with adjuvant imatinib who did not relapse while receiving it. Imatinib is 
also the standard treatment for patients with metastatic disease who have had all lesions removed 
surgically, although surgery is not recommended as a primary approach in the metastatic setting. 
Sunitinib and regorafenib are authorised in the setting of metastatic or unresectable disease after 
failure of previous treatment(s) (see table above). No product is specifically authorised for a 
molecularly defined subgroup of patients.  
Significant benefit 
The therapeutic indication of avapritinib is: “Ayvakyt is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
adult patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation.” The sponsor is therefore 
targeting a patient population with a specific mutation which has been resistant to current authorised 
medicines. 
The sponsor claims that PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST patients show a very low response rate and 
short PFS following treatment with the medicinal products currently authorized for treatment of GIST in 
the EU. 
The clinical development programme supporting the efficacy of avapritinib in GIST includes one 
single pivotal study called the NAVIGATOR study. It is an on-going Phase 1, first-in-human, dose-
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

escalation, expansion, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of 
avapritinib in adults with unresectable GIST. At the time of the MAA submission, efficacy data have 
been provided with a data cut-off date of 16 November 2018. An additional 14 months of follow-up 
(data cut-off date: 17 January 2020) was provided during the MA assessment.  
The study design consisted of two parts: a dose escalation part (Part 1, completed), and a dose 
expansion part (Part 2, ongoing). The open-label, uncontrolled design of the NAVIGATOR study, along 
with the reduced sample size, pose relevant limitations to the interpretation of the results. 
The most recently updated data in the PDGFRA D842V mutated GIST population (DCO: 17-Apr-2020) 
was consistent with the efficacy results previously submitted, and confirmed a high and durable 
response to avapritinib: ORR of 95% (95% CI: 82.3, 99.4), median PFS of 24 months (95% CI: 18.4, 
NE), and a DOR of 22.1 months (95% CI: 14.1, NE). The median OS was not yet reached (36-months 
OS rate is 70.6% (95% CI: 55.2, 86.0). Among the PDGFRA-D842V mutated GIST patients from an 
ongoing, controlled, phase 3 study (BLU-285-1303; VOYAGER; DCO: 09-Mar-2020), ORR in the 
avapritinib group was 42.9% (all partial responses), while none of the patients in the regorafenib 
group responded (0% ORR). Regarding median PFS, there was a statistically significant difference, with 
a non-estimable median PFS in GIST patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations who were randomized to 
avapritinib (95% CI: 9.7, not NE) compared to 4.5 months in patients receiving regorafenib (95% CI: 
1.7, NE). These data were considered supportive to the data from the NAVIGATOR study. 
The result in term of durable responses compared favourably with that reported from the literature to 
other TKIs in the target GIST population. Overall, the reported results in the mutated population were 
considered relevant in the context of a patient population with limited treatment options and poor 
responses to approved TKI agents. This benefit was considered to be clinically meaningful. 
The COMP accepted that a clinically relevant advantage in the proposed target population exists and 
considered significant benefit holds for the purpose of the maintenance of orphan status.

4.  COMP position adopted on 29 July 2020 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) considered that the designated orphan condition 
“Treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours” is acceptable.  
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 3 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to the high rate of 
relapse and development of metastatic disease resulting in a poor survival;  
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that avapritinib may be of significant benefit in the treatment of 
adult patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation, a 
population for which no effective treatments are available, still holds; 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Ayvakyt, (S)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-
1-(2-(4-(6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-yl)piperazin-yl)pyrimidin-5-
yl)ethan-1-amine, avapritinib, for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (EU/3/17/1889) is not 
removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

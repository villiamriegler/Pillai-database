2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
MPS IVA is a rare inherited disorder caused by mutations of the gene that codes for the lysosomal 
enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), which degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 
including keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin sulfate. With insufficient GALNS, GAGs progressively 
accumulate in multiple organs and tissues. The pervasive and progressive accumulation of GAGs 
leads to significant morbidities and multi-systemic clinical impairments resulting in diminished 
functional capacity, decreased endurance, impaired quality of life, and early mortality. The most 
common features of patients with MPS IVA are progressive skeletal dysplasia requiring frequent 
surgical procedures mostly related to musculoskeletal or respiratory dysfunction, and a significant 
limitation in mobility, endurance, and respiratory function. In addition, pain is frequently reported 
by patients with MPS IVA. 
Vimizim is a formulation of elosulfase alfa, which is a purified enzyme produced by recombinant 
DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Vimizim is an enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) intended to provide exogenous enzyme GALNS allowing cellular uptake by the mannose-6-
phosphate receptor and transportation to the lysosomes. This enzyme uptake into the lysosomes 
promotes increased catabolism of KS in tissue macrophages, hyaline cartilage, other connective 
tissues, and heart valve, and reduces the progressive accumulation of KS which is responsible for 
the clinical manifestations of MPS IVA. 
Marketing Authorisation was obtained for Vimizim (elosulfase alfa; BMN 110) in the European Union 
on 28 April 2014.   
The current procedure consists of a study report on Study MOR-006: a Phase 2, Open-label,

in patients with MPS IVA who have limited ambulation 
The exploratory objective of the initial treatment phase of the study was to evaluate the effect of 
2.0 mg/kg/week elosulfase alfa on biochemical markers of bone and cartilage metabolism in 
patients with MPS IVA who have limited ambulation. 
Additional 96 weeks extension phase (up to 144 weeks) 
The primary objective for extending the Phase 2 study was to evaluate the long-term safety 
and efficacy of 2.0 mg/kg/week elosulfase alfa in patients with MPS IVA with limited ambulation. 
Study design 
Phase 2, open-label, multinational study of patients with MPS IVA who are ≥ 5 years of age and 
who have limited ambulation, defined as an inability to walk ≥ 30 meters as assessed by the 6MWT 
performed at the Screening Visit. Subjects who met the other study eligibility criteria and provided 
informed consent were administered weekly infusions of 2.0 mg/kg/week BMN 110 for a total of 48 
consecutive weeks during the initial treatment phase. In addition, subjects could continue into the 
extension phase of the study for up to an additional 96 weeks of study treatment.

or partner) at any time during the study. 
•  Had a concurrent disease or condition, including but not limited to symptomatic cervical 
spine instability or severe cardiac disease or complete paralysis due to a spinal cord injury 
(defined as an inability to move arms and legs), that would interfere with study 
participation or safety as determined by the Investigator. 
•  Had any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, placed the patient at high risk of 
poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study. 
Sample size 
Approximately 20 subjects were to be enrolled into the study. The sample size of the study was not 
determined by statistical power consideration since no statistical hypotheses were posed. 
Treatments 
Subjects were to receive weekly IV infusions of 2.0 mg/kg BMN 110 for up to 144 weeks or until 
one of the following occurred: the subject withdrew consent and discontinued from the study, the 
subject was discontinued from the study by the Investigator, or the study was terminated. 
As subjects may experience hypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of BMN 
110, all subjects were pretreated with an appropriate dose of antihistamine medication 
approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to infusion.

serum tryptase, total IgE, and drug-specific IgE. An independent Allergic Reaction Review Board 
(ARRB), appointed by BioMarin and composed of physicians not directly involved with the study 
(including at least 1 allergist/immunologist), served in a consultant capacity to BioMarin to, at 
BioMarin’s request, review such reactions and make recommendations regarding prevention and 
management of further reactions. An internal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) also acted in an 
advisory capacity to monitor the safety of BMN 110 in subjects who were participating in MOR-006.

Statistical Methods 
Sample Size Determination: The sample size of the study was not determined by statistical power 
consideration, as no statistical hypotheses were posed. In addition to the analyses listed below, 
additional statistical analyses were performed as deemed appropriate. 
Safety Analysis: The analyses of safety included all subjects who received any study drug. Safety 
was assessed by the incidence of AEs and changes in neurologic examinations, vital signs, ECHOs, 
ECGs, cervical spine radiographs, MRI, immunogenicity tests, clinical laboratory tests, and 
concomitant medications. All safety data was summarized descriptively. 
All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence 
of AEs was summarized by System Organ Class (SOC), Preferred Term (PT), relationship to study 
drug, and severity. Each clinically significant laboratory result was recorded as an AE. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
The mITT population included all subjects except the one (0018-6010) who was never dosed in 
MOR-006. Except where specified, all efficacy evaluations were done on the mITT population.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis: All enrolled subjects with at least 1 post-treatment efficacy 
measurement were included. 
Analysis of the domains for upper extremity function (GPT), dexterity (FDT), mobility (25FWT), 
pain (BPI-short form or APPT), and self-care and functional abilities (PODCI or SF-36v2®) were 
performed.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: All enrolled subjects with at least 1 post-treatment efficacy 
measurement were included in the analysis of RFTs and urinary KS levels. Subjects who met the 
eligibility criteria for the sleep substudy and who had at least 1 post-treatment measurement were 
included in the AHI analysis. 
Percent change in FET, FVC, FEV1, FIVC, MVV, and optional TLC values from Baseline to each 
scheduled time point and overall were assessed. For each urinary KS concentration measurement, 
descriptive statistics were provided for Baseline and all subsequent post-treatment scheduled 
assessment visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 or Early Termination Visit 
[ETV]). Change from Baseline and percent change from Baseline to the post-treatment scheduled 
assessment visits were also be provided at these time points. 
Change from Baseline AHI scores were summarized for subjects who participated in the sleep 
substudy. 
Tertiary Analysis: 
Descriptive statistics were provided for growth as determined from anthropometric measurements 
taken at Baseline and at Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 (or ETV). The statistical analysis for 
all other tertiary endpoints were descriptive.

CHMP comment:  
The main objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety and efficacy in patients with MPS 
IVA with limited ambulation. The large number of primary, secondary and tertiary endpoints may 
lead to chance findings likely precluding the ability to draw firm conclusions from this study. 
Furthermore, the study was a single arm study, with all it’s limitations. Moreover, the primary 
endpoints chosen are different from earlier studies, which question the usefulness to draw 
conclusions. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the planned enrollment of 20 subjects, only 16 were ultimately enrolled in MOR-006. The 
enrollment challenge was partially due to the fact that these subjects tended to have more severe 
disease, making it more difficult for them to tolerate the required travel and safely carry out the 
required study assessments. 
Study MOR-006 began on 10 August 2012; the last subject exited the study on 22 October 2014. 
Of the 16 subjects who enrolled in MOR-006, 15 received at least one dose of study treatment. The 
subject who did not receive any study treatment (0018-6010) did so because she could not 
physically commit to the weekly travel necessary to participate in the study. 
Of the 15 subjects treated in MOR-006, 12 completed at least 48 weeks of study treatment. 
Three subjects discontinued study drug prior to Week 48, though all 3 remained on the study 
following drug discontinuation: 
• 
• 
Two subjects (0257-6013 and 0021-6015) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) 
related to drug hypersensitivity. 
The third subject (0257-6011) discontinued from study drug after Week 21 because he felt 
he was having more frequent (non-serious) urinary tract infections during the study; it was 
recorded as the subject’s choice to withdraw from the study treatment, rather than as 
discontinuation due to an adverse event.

Baseline data 
The mean age at enrollment is 20.8 (± 8.67) years. Of the 15 subjects in the mITT population, 9 
(60%) were pediatric (< 19 years old), while 6 (40%) were adults. Nine (60%) of the subjects 
were male. Of the 15 subjects, 7 were non-ambulatory at baseline (meaning that they could not 
perform the 25FWT). Of the 8 ambulatory subjects, the mean (± SD) speed on the 25FWT test was 
40.9 (± 32.76) feet/minute.

Table 2: Baseline Characteristics at MOR-006 Baseline (mITT Population) 
The most common SOCs for which subjects had at least 1 disorder reported as medical history 
were the Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissues Disorder SOC (86.7%) and the Surgical and 
Medical Procedures SOC (80.0%). The medical history terms of highest frequency were knee 
deformity and pectus carinatum (each reported in 8 subjects), followed by kyphosis (in 7 subjects), 
and corneal opacity, body height below normal, and pneumonia (each reported in 6 subjects). 
Efficacy results 
Primary analyses 
The primary analyses were upper extremity function (GPT), dexterity (FDT), mobility (25FWT), pain 
(BPI-short form or APPT), and self-care and functional abilities (PODCI or SF-36v2®) testing. 
•  Dexterity (Functional Dexterity Test: FDT) 
After 48 weeks of treatment with BMN 110, overall the mITT population shows a trend toward 
increased functional dexterity in both the dominant and non-dominant hand. The increase appears 
to be sustained through Week 72.  
Baseline mean (± SD) speed in the dominant and non-dominant hands was 13.3 (± 10.86) 
pegs/minute and 13.2 (± 12.49) pegs/minute, respectively. At Week 48, the mean (± SD) speed in

the dominant and non-dominant hands was 17.9 (± 15.18) pegs/minute and 16.8 (± 14.21) 
pegs/minute, respectively. At Week 48, there is a 23.1% (± 53.88%) increase over baseline in the 
FDT in the dominant hand, and a 6.0% (± 35.78%) increase in the non-dominant hand. A mean 
increase of 2.8 pegs/minute (at Week 48) in the dominant hand can also be stated as an increase 
of approximately 0.047 pegs/second. This rate of increase is generally consistent with the increase 
observed in developing children (0.04 pegs per second per year of age).

•  Upper extremity function (Grip/Pinch Test: GPT) 
An electronic grip-strength dynamometer was used in this study to measure grip strength, and an 
electronic pinch meter was used to measure pinch strength. 
After 48 weeks of treatment with BMN 110, overall the mITT population showed no meaningful 
change in either average grip strength or average pinch strength based on the data available for 
analysis (n=15). In general, subjects performed better in supported positions than in unsupported 
for both the pinch and grip test.  
Mean grip strength at Baseline was 1.3 ( ± 0.90) kg (supported) and 1.0 ( ± 0.77) kg 
(unsupported) in the dominant hand, and was 1.1 ( ± 0.85) kg (supported) and 0.9 ( ± 0.66) kg 
(unsupported) in the non-dominant hand.  
Table: Change from Baseline by Time for Grip Test (mITT Population) 
Mean pinch strength at Baseline was 0.6 ( ± 0.36) kg (supported) and 0.5 ( ± 0.37) kg 
(unsupported) in the dominant hand, and was 0.5 ( ± 0.39) kg (supported) and 0.5 ( ± 0.37) kg 
(unsupported) in the non-dominant hand.

Table: Descriptive Summary of Pinch Test (mITT Population) 
•  Mobility (25-Foot Walk Test) 
The 25FWT is an assessment of mobility and leg function performance based on a timed 25-foot 
walk. Subjects could use assistive devices when doing this task. In addition, subjects could “walk” 
(walk, crawl, or roll) on their knees if this was their usual method of ambulation. 
At Baseline, 8 of 15 (53.3%) subjects were physically able to perform the 25FWT, either using a 
walking aid or unassisted. Of the subjects who were able to perform the 25FWT, 3 walked (1 with 
the assistance of a walking device), 2 crawled, 1 walked on his knees, 1 rolled, and 1 pulled herself 
along using only her arms. Subjects who were physically unable to performed the test were scored 
as zero.  
At Week 48, there is a 53.5% (± 102.74%) improvement in speed (in feet/minute) of the 25FWT 
compared with Baseline, and a 48.3% (± 145.01%) improvement at Week 72. In a study of 
subjects with multiple sclerosis, an increase of more than 20% in the Timed 25FWT was said to be 
a clinically meaningful improvement. The subset of subjects (n=8) who had a Baseline 25FWT 
distance > 0 meters (ie, the subset of subjects who were physically capable of performing the 
25FWT at Baseline) had a larger absolute numerical improvement in performance on the Timed 
25FWT at Week 48 than was seen in the mITT population as a whole.

•  Pain (BPI-short form or APPT) 
Pain was assessed using one of two tools, based on the age of the subject: 
• 
• 
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was the tool used for assessing adult subjects (n=8) 
The Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (APPT) was used for assessing pediatric or adolescent 
subjects (n=7). 
•  Pain (BPI-short) 
The BPI was developed to provide information on the intensity of pain (the sensory dimension), as 
well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (the reactive dimension). The BPI was 
administered to subjects ≥ 18 years old (n=8) every 12 weeks during the study. 
At Baseline, 2 subjects reported no pain, 3 reported mild pain, 2 reported moderate pain, and 1 
reported severe pain. Overall, adult subjects who were assessed using the BPI showed minimal 
change between Baseline and Week 48 on any of the scales being assessed, with the possible 
exception of a small decrease in pain interference with function. 
At Week 48: 
• 
• 
• 
Two subjects with mild pain at Baseline now reported no pain, and 1 subject with moderate 
pain reported mild pain. One subject reported that his ¡§worst¡¨ pain had increased from 
mild to moderate, and 5 subjects (increased from 3) now reported ¡§non-trivial¡¨ pain.  
For pain interference with function, the average change from Baseline was -0.9 (¡Ó 1.25) 
(on a 0-10 scale).  
For worst pain in the last 24 hours, the average change from Baseline was +0.3 (¡Ó 0.46) 
(on a 0-10 scale). No subjects reported any change in their worst pain in the last 24 hours 
categories between Baseline and Week 48.

•  Subject 1099-6012 had large variances in BPI scores across visits and contributed to the 
fluctuation of the change from Baseline across timepoints. In the per-protocol analysis, 
when Subject 1099-6012 is removed, the mean change from Baseline is consistently less 
than 0 during the primary treatment phase, indicating reduced pain in subjects. 
•  Pain ( APPT) 
The Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (APPT) is a validated, multidimensional tool to evaluate pain in 
children, adolescents, and young adults. The APPT assesses pain on 3 scales: the location(s) of the 
pain, the severity of the pain, and the subject’s use of descriptive terms (from a list of 67 
possibilities) to describe his/her pain. The APPT was administered to pediatric/adolescent subjects 
(n=7) every 12 weeks during the study.  
At Baseline, 6 (85.7%) of the 7 subjects assessed reported some pain; the most common sites of 
pain were the lower torso, abdomen, buttocks, and groin (5 subjects), the chest and back (3 
subjects), and lower extremities (2 subjects). The intensity of pain overall was reported as no pain 
in 2 subjects, mild in 2 subjects, moderate in 2 subjects, and severe in 1 subject. Subjects on 
average selected 6.7 (± 4.61) descriptive pain words to describe their pain (or 10% of all possible 
words). 
Despite some variability, pediatric/adolescent subjects who were assessed using the APPT did not 
appear to show any meaningful improvement during the study on either the Words Graphic Rating 
Scale or the Total Words scale. 
At Week 48: 
• 
• 
Two subjects reported pain at fewer locations than at Baseline, 2 reported pain at more 
locations, and 1 reported no change  
For intensity of pain, the average change from Baseline was +1.8 (¡Ó 3.53) (on a 0-10 
scale) (Table 14.2.4.3.1). Of the 6 subjects assessed at that visit, 1 had increased from no 
pain to severe pain, one had increased from mild to moderate pain, and one had decreased 
from moderate to mild pain (the others showed no change). 
•  Subjects selected an average of 5.5 (¡Ó 4.93) descriptive words to describe their pain, a 
0.3% (¡Ó 4.50) decrease from Baseline. 
•  Self-care and functional abilities (PODCI) 
The PODCI is designed for patients ≤18 years old and assesses the overall health, pain, and ability 
to participate in normal daily activities, as well as in more vigorous activities associated with young 
people. The eight scales addressed in the instruments offer a broad view of the physical, mental, 
and attitudinal condition of the young patient. The PODCI was administered to pediatric/adolescent 
subjects (n=7) and their parents every 12 weeks during the study. 
The scale scores were normalized such that a normal individual will have a score of 50 and SD of 
10. Among the four physical health calculated scale scores at Baseline, the transfer and basic 
mobility normative scores are the worst (-147.0 [ ± 20.93]) and the pain/comfort scale scores are 
the best (32.2 [ ± 22.88]). The happiness score is the only calculated domain score in 
psychological health; the happiness score at Baseline is 42.8 (± 13.77), indicating a close to 
normal psychological health in MOR-006 subjects. 
Overall, subjects’ self-reported assessments on the PODCI showed no meaningful change between 
Baseline and Week 48 on any of the scales being assessed. Similar results were noted on the 
parents’ PODCI assessments.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/592423/2015   
Page 18/27 
 
 
 
 
At Week 48, subjects reported a -2.2% (± 20.03) change in the overall global functioning scale 
normative score, and a -2.7% (± 18.81) change in the happiness scale normative score. Parents 
reported a -22.3% (± 40.50) change in the overall global functioning scale normative score, and a 
+0.8% (± 31.80) change in the happiness scale normative score. Cumulative distribution functions 
(CDF) for the subject’s self-reported responses to the PODCI possibly show some improvement at 
Week 48, particularly in the global functioning and pain/comfort scales. This suggests that, while 
the overall assessment of PODCI responses shows no change, some subjects are seeing 
improvement in one or more domains. No meaningful changes are noted in the CDF plot for parent 
responses to the PODCI. 
•  Self-care and functional abilities (SF-36v2®) 
The SF-36 is a validated 36-item questionnaire that yields an 8-scale health profile and summary 
measures of health-related quality of life. The SF-36 was administered to adult subjects (n=8) 
every 12 weeks during the study.  
Overall, assessments on the SF-36 showed a positive percentage change between Baseline and 
Week 48 on both the physical and mental health aggregate scores.  
Figure: SF36 Component Scores: Mean Change from Baseline 
At Week 48, subjects reported a +10.9% (± 31.66) change in the physical health score, and a 
+7.3% (± 17.24) change in the mental health score. The largest contributor to the increased 
physical health score came from the physical limitation subscale, where subjects reported a 
+33.6% (± 33.94) change at Week 48. Subjects’ mean mental scores are generally above 50, 
indicating an above average mental status. This observation is aligned with the higher scores in 
psychological health domain scales in PODCI. 
As with the PODCI, a CDF graph of the responses to the SF36 show that, while the overall results 
are mixed, some subjects are likely seeing improvement on the physical and/or mental health 
domains.

Secondary analyses 
•  Respiratory Function Tests: Overall, there were small (8% or less) positive percentage 
changes for 5 of the 6 parameters (MVV, FVC, FEV1, FIVC, FET, TLC) at Week 48, with 
absolute measurements showing little to no change. 
•  AHI: A subset of 9 subjects with abnormal overnight pulse oximetry readings at Screening 
were enrolled in a sleep study. Mean Screening/Baseline AHI for all subjects tested in MOR-
006 (n=7) was 14.1 (± 12.49); at Week 48, subjects showed an increase in mean AHI to 
28.3 (± 29.28). Mean desaturations of ≥ 3% per hour was 14.6 (± 11.16) at Baseline; the 
mean increased to 23.7 (± 25.03) at Week 48. Overall, no improvement in sleep apnea 
was noted after 48 weeks of treatment. 
•  Urine KS: In MOR-006, treatment with BMN 110 for 48 weeks led to a rapid and sustained 
decrease in urinary KS, which continued in a smaller population at Week 72. At Week 48, 
urine KS had decreased by a mean of 43.4% (± 24.82%). These findings were consistent 
with the declines in urinary KS that have been seen in other BMN 110 studies. 
Most important tertiary analysis 
•  6MWT (6 Minute Walk Test) 
Subjects who could perform the 6MWT during the study were given the opportunity to do soat 
Screening, Weeks 24 and 48 of the treatment phase, and every 48 weeks during theextension 
phase. Subjects who were physically unable to perform the 6MWT had thatindicated on their CRFs. 
Of the 15 subjects in the mITT population, 3 were physically able to perform the 6MWT atthe Week 
24 and/or Week 48 endpoints. One subject (0109-6014) completed the test at Screening/Baseline 
and Week 48 using the same ambulation/walking aids at each visit; that subject increased his 
6MWT distance from 31.7 meters to 66.5 meters at Week 48. All 3 subjects who performed the 
6MWT at Week 24 and/or Week 48 were able to complete the test (i.e., were able to perform the 
test for 6 minutes without stopping early due to pain or other reasons). 
CHMP comment:  
The study population was generally less healthy than in previous studies conducted in this disease 
because of limited ambulation, defined as an inability to walk ≥ 30 meters as assessed by the 
6MWT performed at the Screening Visit. Consequently the 6 MWT is of less use as an assessment 
tool and likely therefore not considered as primary endpoint.  
The range of primary analyses evaluated demonstrated heterogeneic results. Dexterity and upper 
extremity function demonstrated different results, with only dexterity by means of the  FDT test 
showing a not so obvious slight trend toward improvement. Such clinically irrelevant improvements 
have also been observed in previous studies. 
The mobility test (25 Foot Walk Test showed some improvement in speed. However, one may 
argue the relevance of such an observation considering that eventually only one patient was able 
to perform the (tertiary) endpoint of 6MWT. 
Both pain scales did not demonstrate any meaningful effect. 
Self-care and functional abilities tests (PODCI and SF-36v2®) showed different results, with only 
the SF-36 demonstrating some improvement, questioning the relevance of this observation. 
Further, treatment with BMN 110 led to decreases in mean normalized Urine KS levels in 
agreement with other studies.

Overall, the study does not allow robust conclusions for efficacy due to heterogeneous and/or 
questionable clinical meaningful treatment effects.   
Safety results 
The mean (± SD) and range of total duration of BMN 110 exposure in MOR-006 were 62.1 (± 
31.03) and 5 to 96 weeks, respectively.  
The mean (± SD) weekly BMN 110 dose in MOR-006 was 1.7 (± 0.25) mg/kg; the mean (± SD) 
total BMN 110 dose/subject was 108.7 (± 56.75) mg/kg. One subject missed more than 40% of 
her scheduled infusions, and 6 other subjects missed between 7 and 18 doses. These missed 
infusions are the primary reason why the mean weekly dose (1.7 mg/kg) is markedly lower than 
the 2.0 mg/kg prescribed weekly dose.  
None of the 15 subjects who received at least one dose (mITT population) withdrew from the study 
as a result of adverse events. Two subjects experienced adverse events related to drug 
hypersensitivity that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment, though both subjects 
remained on the study. There were no deaths in the study. 
All 15 (100.0%) subjects in MOR-006 had at least 1 treatment-emergent AE, and SAEs were 
reported for 7 (46.7%) subjects.  
The most commonly reported AEs were headache (73.3%), nasopharyngitis (60.0%), and pyrexia 
(60.0%). Most AEs were reported in only 1 or 2 subjects.

Table. Overall summary of adverse events (safety population) 
Study drug-related AEs were reported for 13 (86.7%) subjects in MOR-006, including 2 subjects 
who experienced CTCAE grade 3 drug-related AEs (infusion related reaction and hypersensitivity). 
The most commonly reported related AEs were headache (40.0%), nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting 
(20.0% each).

Table: Study Drug-Related AEs; Incidence in ≥ 10% of Subjects (Safety Population) 
Study drug-related SAEs were reported in 2 (13.3%) subjects. Six subjects experienced a total of 7 
grade 3 AEs (poor venous access, hypersensitivity, increased blood bilirubin, cervical cord 
compression, infusion related reaction, pneumonia mycoplasmal, and respiratory failure). No grade 
3 AE was reported in more than one subject. Two of these events (hypersensitivity and infusion 
related reaction) were assessed as related to study treatment. No subjects experienced a grade 4 
event during MOR-006.  
Sixteen SAEs were reported for 7 (46.7%) subjects. Four study drug-related SAEs were reported in 
2 (13.3%) subjects. No SAE was reported in more than one subject. Most SAEs were consistent 
with orthopedic disease complications or cannulation difficulties. Six (40.0%) subjects experienced 
a total of 12 hypersensitivity AEs. With the exception of 2 SAEs of hypersensitivity occurring in the 
same subject, all hypersensitivity AEs were non-serious. The 12 potential hypersensitivity events 
were medically assessed against the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food 
Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) 2006 criteria for anaphylaxis. Of the 12 events, 10 
were found to be single events which did not satisfy the NIAID/FAAN criteria. The remaining two 
events (both in Subject 0020-6005) were reported as grade 2 events of anaphylactic reaction and 
anaphylactoid reaction; however, the information received from the investigator on these events 
was insufficient to permit assessment against the NIAID/FAAN criteria. Of note, neither of these 
events was assessed as severe, both resolved, and the subject remained on the study and 
continued to receive BMN 110 without the recurrence of similar events. 
Six (40.0%) subjects had at least one infusion interrupted or discontinued due to an AE that 
required medical intervention. Less than 2% of total infusions were interrupted or discontinued due 
to an AE that required medical intervention. Events were effectively managed with infusion rate 
changes and medications. 
Overall, changes from baseline in clinical laboratory tests were not notable. Clinically significant 
vital signs and abnormal physical examination findings were reported as AEs. One subject 
experienced a grade 3 event of increased blood bilirubin (along with non-serious grade 2 elevated 
ALT), both of which resolved within 2 weeks. Vital signs AEs included pyrexia, tachycardia, body 
temperature increased, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, and tachypnoea. Most events were grade 1 
in severity, and all events were non-serious. Three events of grade 2 pyrexia resulted in infusion 
interruptions; all resolved within 1-7 days following treatment with antipyretic and/or antibiotic 
medications.

Eleven subjects (73.3%) reported corneal clouding as part of their medical history at Baseline. 
Overall, no meaningful change in corneal clouding was noted. No adverse events related to 
echocardiogram findings were reported during MOR-006. One subject had AE reports of grade 1 
first degree atrioventricular block and prolonged PR interval on ECG. The subject was noted to have 
had complete right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block at baseline ECG. Review of 
shift tables reveals little change in either radiographic or MRI findings. 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during the study. 
Immunogenicity Results 
Serum samples were collected for immunogenicity testing prior to dose administration at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 (or ETV). 
All treated subjects (Safety) tested positive for anti-BMN 110 TAb by Week 4 and remained positive 
for the duration of the study. Each of the three subjects who discontinued study drug prior to Week 
48 tested positive for TAb and NAb following treatment initiation. During the initial treatment phase 
(Baseline to Week 48), mean TAb titers peaked at Week 48 in the Safety and PP populations. Of 
those subjects that remained on treatment, TAb responses decreased or remained stable in the 
extension phase (post-Week 48) in 5/9 subjects and increased in 4/9 subjects. All treated subjects 
tested positive for neutralizing antibodies during the study. Most subjects (11/14, 78.6%) were 
NAb positive by Week 4. NAb responses were sustained (remained positive once detected) in 9 
(60%) and were transiently positive in 6 (40%) subjects. The overall incidence of NAb positivity at 
Week 48 was 66.7% (10/15). The earliest NAb positive result occurred at Week 2, and the latest 
time point for a subject to first test positive for NAb was Week 24. No subjects tested positive for 
BMN 110 IgE during the study. 
Despite the universal development of anti-drug antibodies, urine KS decreased from Baseline in all 
treated subjects. Overall, subjects with higher TAb titers had similar reductions in urine KS at 
Weeks 24 and 48 compared to subjects with lower TAb titers and no consistent association was 
detected between TAb titer and percent change in uKS from Baseline. In addition, subjects with 
higher NAb positivity rates had similar reductions in urine KS at Weeks 24 and 48 compared to 
subjects with lower NAb positivity rates and no overall association was detected between NAb 
positivity rate and percent change in uKS from Baseline. 
Subjects with higher antibody titers (> mean) at Weeks 24 and 48 did not have a higher incidence 
of Hypersensitivity AEs compared to subjects with lower antibody titers. There was no relationship 
between TAb titers and the occurrence of anaphylactic reactions or study drug discontinuation. Due 
to the exploratory nature of the efficacy assessments performed in this study and the low sample 
numbers, no analysis was performed to determine the relationship between immunogenicity and 
efficacy outcomes in MOR-006.

Table: Incidence of Antibody Positivity by Study Visit (Safety Population) 
CHMP comment:  
All subjects experienced 1 or more AEs, however, only 13% of these events were considered a 
drug-related SAE. The most commonly reported study-drug related adverse events for the total 
population were headache, pyrexia, nausea and vomiting, which are known to be associated with 
BMN 110 treatment.  Two subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE (but 
remained on the study)which can be considered acceptable.  
There was no association between antibody titers and incidence of hypersensitivity adverse events 
or discontinuation, as comparable to the previous studies performed. 
Overall, no new or unexpected safety signals were observed from the study and the safety results 
are consistent with prior studies and the established safety profile for BMN 110. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The purpose of the MOR-006 study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2.0 mg/kg/week BMN 
110 in MPS IVA patients who are ≥ 5 years of age and who have limited ambulation, defined as an  
nability to walk 30 meters as assessed by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) performed at the 
Screening Visit. 
The study population was generally less healthier than in previous studies conducted in this disease 
because of limited ambulation, defined as an inability to walk ≥ 30 meters as assessed by the 
6MWT performed at the Screening Visit. Consequently the 6 MWT is of less use as an assessment 
tool and likely therefore not considered as primary endpoint.  
The range of primary analyses evaluated demonstrated heterogenic results. Dexterity and upper 
extremity function demonstrated different results, with only dexterity by means of the  FDT test 
showing a not so obvious slight trend toward improvement. Such clinically irrelevant improvements 
have also been observed in previous studies. 
The mobility test (25 Foot Walk Test showed some improvement in speed. However, one may 
argue the relevance of such an observation considering that eventually only one patient was able 
to perform the (tertiary) endpoint of 6MWT.

Both pain scales did not demonstrate any meaningful effect. 
Self-care and functional abilities tests (PODCI and SF-36v2®) showed different results, with only 
the SF-36 demonstrating some improvement, questioning the relevance of this observation. 
Further, treatment with BMN 110 led to decreases in mean normalized Urine KS levels in 
agreement with other studies. 
Overall, the study does not allow to draw robust conclusions for efficacy, because of heterogeneous 
and/or questionable clinical meaningful treatment effects.   
In terms of safety, no new or unexpected safety signals were observed from the study and the 
safety results are consistent with prior studies and the established safety profile for BMN 110. 
In detail, all subjects experienced 1 or more AEs, however, only 13% of these events were 
considered a drug-related SAE. The most commonly reported study-drug related adverse events for 
the total population were headache, pyrexia, nausea and vomiting, which are known to be 
associated with BMN 110 treatment.  Two subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to an 
AE (but remained on study) which can be considered acceptable. There was no association between 
antibody titers and incidence of hypersensitivity adverse events or discontinuation, as comparable 
to the previous studies performed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The study does not allow to draw robust conclusions for efficacy, due to limitations in study design 
and the observed heterogeneous and/or questionable clinical meaningful treatment effects . 
However, there are no efficacy findings that are not in line with the results of the previous studies. 
No new or unexpected safety signals were observed from the study and the safety results are 
consistent with prior studies and the established safety profile for BMN 110. 
Therefore the B/R of Vimizim remains positive.  
No changes in the SmPC were proposed by the MAH. Given the confirmative or indistinct results  of 
this study no changes in the SmPC are proposed by the Rapporteur.

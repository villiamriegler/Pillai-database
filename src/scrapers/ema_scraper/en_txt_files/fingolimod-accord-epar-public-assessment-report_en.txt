2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The product Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules was developed as a generic equivalent to the 
innovator’s product Gilenya 0.5 mg hard capsules. Gilenya was authorised in the EU on 17.03.2011. 
The indication proposed for Fingolimod Accord is the same as authorized for the reference medicinal 
product Gilenya. The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use. 
Both the test and the reference product contain the same active ingredient i.e. fingolimod 
hydrochloride. 
Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Fingolimod is metabolised by sphingosine 
kinase to the active metabolite fingolimod phosphate. By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P 
receptors on lymphocytes, fingolimod phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from 
lymph nodes, causing a redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. This redistribution 
reduces the infiltration of pathogenic lymphocytes, including pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, into the 
CNS, where they would be involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage. 
One bioequivalence (BE) study has been performed with the originator. The test product (Fingolimod 
Accord, 0.5 mg hard capsules) and the reference product (Gilenya, 0.5 mg hard capsules) were 
compared under fasting conditions (Study No. 498-14). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 0.56 mg of fingolimod hydrochloride as 
the active substance, corresponding to 0.5 mg of fingolimod.

pregelatinised starch and magnesium stearate in the capsule fill, 
gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171) and yellow iron oxide (E172) in the capsule shell,  
shellac  (E904),  propylene  glycol  (E1520),  potassium  hydroxide,  black  iron  oxide  (E172)  and 
yellow iron oxide (E172) in the printing ink. 
The product is available in polyvinylchloride (PVC)/polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC)/aluminium blisters as 
follows:

blister packs containing 7, 28 or 98 hard capsules. 
perforated unit dose blister packs containing 7 x 1, 28 x 1 or 98 x 1 hard capsule 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
There is one manufacturer of the active substance and documentation of the active substance is provided 
using the ASMF procedure.  
General Information 
The  chemical  name  of  fingolimod  hydrochloride  is  2-amino-2-(4-octylphenethyl)propane-1,3-diol 
hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C19H33NO2.HCl. It has a relative molecular mass 
of 343.93 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1 Active substance structure 
It is a white to almost white powder. It is freely soluble in water and ethanol and practically insoluble in 
heptane.  
The  chemical  structure  of  fingolimod  hydrochloride  has  been  confirmed  by  various  techniques  like 
infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, 13C-
NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS).  
Fingolimod hydrochloride has a non-chiral molecular structure. 
Polymorphism has been observed for fingolimod hydrochloride and several crystalline forms are reported 
in literature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data provided confirms 
that the active substance used for Fingolimod Accord is the desired polymorphic form. This is routinely 
controlled in the active substance specification. Transition between crystalline forms is temperature and 
humidity  dependant.  The  desired  polymorphic  form  remains  stable  under  the  proposed  long-term 
stability condition. 
Fingolimod hydrochloride in the desired polymorphic form has been confirmed to be non-hygroscopic.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. There is one source of the active substance. 
The synthesis of fingolimod hydrochloride is divided into two phases. 
The synthesis of fingolimod hydrochloride consists of 6 stages, with five stages in which chemical bond 
formation  or  cleavage  is  involved  (the  last  stage  includes  salt  formation).  During  the  synthesis  five 
intermediates  are  isolated.  Three  starting  materials  are  proposed  in  the  synthesis  of  fingolimod 
hydrochloride  which  are  all  incorporated  as  significant  structural  fragments  in  the  final  API.  With  the 
proposed  starting  materials,  enough  steps  are  conducted  under  GMP  to  appropriately  mitigate  risks 
associated  with  contamination  and  future  changes  to  the  synthetic  route  or  supplier  of  the  starting 
material. Therefore, proposed starting materials are acceptable and adequate data for all raw materials 
used in the synthesis are provided.  
One of the initially proposed starting materials was not considered acceptable as it was not considered 
to be in line with ICH Q11 guidelines on selection of starting materials. A major objection was raised in 
this  regard.  In  response,  the  applicant  redefined  the  starting  materials  an  earlier  stage  and  this  was 
considered acceptable. 
A second major objection was raised in relation the risk of formation of specific impurity during the active 
substance synthesis.  Routine testing of the impurity in the active substance specification was considered 
necessary. The applicant updated the specification and the major objection was resolved.   
In each stage of synthesis critical parameters have been identified and justified. Acceptance criteria and 
ranges  are  defined.  Adequate  in-process  controls  are  set.  Description  of  the  analytical  methods  used 
during in-process control is provided. The specification and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting materials and reagents have been presented. Reprocessing has been adequately described and 
justified. 
Specifications  and  analytical  procedures  are  provided  for  the  five  intermediates  and  considered 
acceptable. 
Summary of process validation on three production scale batches of the intermediate 2-acetamido-2-
phenethyl propane-1,3-diyl diacetate and on final active substance is provided. Defined critical process 
parameters are in the specified ranges for three validation batches. Results for the validation batches, 
as tested per active substance specification, are within proposed limits. 
Adequate data regarding possible impurities in the active substance has been provided: impurities from 
the synthesis, possibility of presence of Ph.Eur. impurities, inorganic impurities, residual solvents and 
genotoxic  impurities  including  possibility  of  presence  of  nitroso  impurities.  Also,  relevant  carry-over 
studies  have  been  conducted  which  indicate  that  the  control  of  impurities  in  the  active  substance  is 
adequate.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
The  proposed  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description,  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.), 
identification (IR, XRD, Chloride), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), appearance of solution, 
Pd  content  (ICP),  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC,  HPLC),  2-
chloropropane (GC), NDEA content (LCMS), microbial examination (Ph. Eur.) and particle size. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/267804/2020  
Page 9/33 
 
 
 
The  active  substance  specification  is  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  monograph  for  fingolimod  hydrochloride 
(07/2019:2988).  For  the  tests  proposed  as  additional  testing  in  comparison  to  the  monograph  (XRD 
identification, appearance of solution, Pd content, specified in-house impurities A-F, residual solvents, 
2-chloropropane and microbial test) justified limits have been proposed.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately validated.  
Specificity of the related substances method was demonstrated by spiked test preparation with known 
in-house impurities A-F. The applicant also demonstrated equivalency between the in-house and Ph.Eur. 
related  substances  and  assay  methods.  In-house  related  substances  and  assay  methods  have  the 
capability to detect and separate in-house and Ph.Eur. impurities, therefore the use of in-house methods 
for testing of assay and related substances is considered acceptable.  
Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  standards  used  has  been  presented.  Fingolimod  hydrochloride 
working standard is evaluated against the Ph. Eur. chemical reference standard (CRS) while adequate 
data have been provided for impurities standards.  
Batch analysis data from three consecutive, commercial scale batches of the active substance has been 
provided. The results are within the specifications and show batch to batch consistency. 
The active substance is packed in a double polyethylene bag, which is placed in triple laminated bag and 
inserted in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum. Adequate specification and test procedures of the 
packaging materials have been provided. Compliance of the primary packaging material with Commission 
regulation  10/2011  has  been  stated.  In  addition,  the  packaging  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur  3.2.2 
(Plastic containers and closures for pharmaceutical use) and 3.1.3 (Polyolefins). 
Stability 
Results  of  stability  testing  on  three  commercial  scale  batches  (manufactured  in  2014),  packed  under 
simulated market packs, at 25°C/60% RH (36 months), 30°C/65%RH (12 months) and 40°C/75% RH 
(6  months)  according  to  the  previous  specification  are  provided.  Stability  results  according  to  the 
specification enclosed in section S.4.1 are provided for an additional three batches manufactured in 2019 
(up to 6 months at 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH).  
All results for tested parameters remained within specifications at long-term conditions and accelerated 
conditions for the tested time period and no obvious trends or significant changes were observed.  
A retest period of 24 months, in an airtight container at 25°C with excursions permitted to 15°C-30°C, 
protected from light, was proposed. It was demonstrated that no polymorphic form change is observed 
during storage at 25°C as well as up to 4 months at 30°C. Therefore, the proposed storage condition “at 
25°C with excursions permitted to 15°C-30°C” for the active substance is acceptable.  
The  results of  the  forced degradation  study  showed  that the  HPLC  methods  for  assay  and  for  related 
substances are stability indicating.  
Although the Applicant did not demonstrate photolytic degradation in its own study (according to ICH 
Q1B), storage protected from light could be accepted for the active substance. 
Based on the provided results, the proposed retest-period of 24 months is acceptable since the previous 
specification is not critically changed (limits for impurities are tightened, equivalence between the in-
house and Ph.Eur. methods is demonstrated and no stability relevant parameter is added), all results for 
previous batches up to 36 months are in line with updated specification, and results up to six months for 
Assessment report

3 new commercial scale batches (tested in line with updated specification) are comparable with results 
for previous batches. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Fingolimod 0.5 mg capsule is a bright yellow opaque/white opaque size “3” hard gelatin capsule imprinted 
with “FO 0.5 mg” on the cap and two radial bands on the capsule body with yellow ink containing white 
to off-white powder. Each capsule is approximately 15.8 mm in length. 
The qualitative finished product composition is outlined below: 
- 
- 
- 
Fingolimod hydrochloride, pregelatinised starch and magnesium stearate in the capsule fill, 
gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171) and yellow iron oxide (E172) in the capsule shell,  
shellac  (E904),  propylene  glycol  (E1520),  potassium  hydroxide,  black  iron  oxide  (E172)  and 
yellow iron oxide (E172) in the printing ink. 
The  description  and  composition  of  the  finished  product  is  adequate.  All  excipients,  capsule  shell 
components and printing ink components are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except iron oxide yellow and black (E172) which are not described in 
Ph. Eur. but comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  formulation  development  was  based  on  the  composition  of  the  reference  product  Gilenya.  The 
qualitative composition of the capsule fill is similar to the composition of the reference product with a 
difference in diluent (mannitol, present in the reference product, is replaced with pregelatinised starch). 
The composition of the hard capsule and ink is similar to that of the reference product. Composition of 
capsule fill consists of only two excipients, for which content was optimized by dissolution studies and 
capsule fill weight of the reference product. Considering the very low content of active substance in the 
capsule fill, blend uniformity is assured by specified particle size distribution of fingolimod. Particle size 
distribution is also reflected in the specification of the pregelatinised starch and magnesium stearate.  
The  information  provided  in  relation  to  control  of  polymorphic  forms  of  the  active  substance  is 
satisfactory.  
The  choice  of  routine  dissolution  method  has  been  adequately  justified.  The  Applicant  adequately 
demonstrated the optimal concentration of SLS for the QC dissolution method. The discriminatory power 
of the method was demonstrated on a batch manufactured with active substance with a coarser particle 
size distribution than what is specified in the active substance specification. 
A  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  with  relevant  batches  of  the  test  and  the  reference  products. 
Please  refer  to  the  clinical  section  for  further  details  of  this  study.  The  test  product  used  in  the 
bioequivalence study is identical to the proposed commercial formulation.  
Comparative dissolution profiles of the bioequivalence batches of the test and the reference product have 
been presented in 3 media with addition of 0.2% SLS (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8; basket, 100 rpm, 500 
ml).  In  all  media,  more  than  85%  of  API  is  dissolved  in  15  min,  and  thus,  no  further  calculation  is 
required.  Comparative  dissolution  profiles  in  QC  medium  for  2  validation  batches,  the  test  product 
bioequivalence batch and the reference product were also provided and found to be similar (more than 
85% release is observed within 15 minutes for all batches).

High-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles  pack  comprises  white  opaque  HDPE  bottle  fitted  with  white 
opaque polypropylene closure with wad having induction sealing liner.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process is a standard process consisting of sifting of raw materials, 
direct blending and encapsulation. In-process controls are adequate as well as proposed holding times 
of lubricated granules (30 days in stainless steel container) and bulk capsules (2 months in double PE 
bags with triple laminated polybag inside HDPE container).  
Process validation has been carried out on three commercial size batches and the manufacturing process 
can therefore be considered as validated. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance, content, identification (HPLC, UV), loss on drying, dissolution, uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), microbial examination (Ph. Eur.). 
Identification of the active substance is controlled by two methods (HPLC and UV) in line with ICH Q6A. 
Limits  for  uniformity of  dosage  units  and  microbiological  quality  are in line  with the  relevant  Ph.  Eur. 
monographs.  The  proposed  limits  for  fingolimod  assay  of  95-105%  throughout  the  shelf  life  of  the 
product  are  acceptable.  Upon  request,  the  limit  for dissolution  was  tightened according  to dissolution 
results for the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
The limit for single impurity is in line with ICH threshold and therefore acceptable as well as the limits 
for total impurities.  
The Applicant has also performed a risk evaluation regarding the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the finished product. The data provided regarding the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished 
product is considered adequate.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 batches 
using a validated ICP-MC method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was  not  detected  above  30%  of  the  respective  permitted  daily  exposure  (PDE).  Based  on  the  data 
presented it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the 
finished product specification. The information on control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.

Analytical methods have been adequately described and satisfactorily validated for intended purposes.  
Batch analysis results were provided for of 3 validation batches which were within the specification at 
the time of testing. The results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Appropriate in-house reference standards are used. It is confirmed that the fingolimod in-house working 
standard is qualified against Ph.Eur. CRS.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data has been provided for three validation batches of commercial size packed in the proposed 
market pack (Alu-PVC/PVdC blister) and in bulk / transportation packs (PPCP container and HDPE bottle) 
in accordance with current ICH/CHMP guidelines. 
For the Alu-PVC/PVdC blisters results up to 36 months at 25°C/60% RH and up to 6 months at 40°C/75% 
RH were provided and found within specification.  
Results for finished product stored in bulk / transportation packs indicate that bulk capsules are stable 
for 3 years in HDPE bottles and for 2 years in PCPP container.  
Based on the results of photostability study according to ICH Q1B it can be concluded that the finished 
product is photostable.  
Considering  the  potential  polymorphic  form  transition  at  elevated  temperatures,  the  finished  product 
should be stored below 25°C.   
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life of 3 years for finished product packed in 
Alu-PVC/PVdC blisters and stored below 25°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the hard gelatine capsule shells. Valid TSE CEPs from 
the suppliers of the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Two major objections were raised on quality aspects during the procedure. One of the initially proposed 
starting materials was not considered acceptable as it was not considered to be in line with ICH Q11. In 
response,  the  applicant  redefined  the  starting  materials  an  earlier  stage  and  this  was  considered 
acceptable to resolve the major objection. The second major objection related to the risk of formation 
of  a  specific  impurity  during  the  synthesis  of  the  active  substance. The  major  objection  was  resolved 
through the introduction of routine testing of this impurity in the active substance specification.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided.   
In the initial report impurity profile was not discussed adequately and it was a point of minor concern. 
The updated overview written in December 2019, refers to 19 literature references dated from 2002 up 
to 2019. Some of the references are product information of the reference product Gilenya (Product 
Information, Product Monograph and Summary of product characteristics) which is acceptable in this 
case.  
Impurity profile and excipients are discussed adequately. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Fingolimod Accord is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all fingolimod containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of fingolimod are well known. As 
fingolimod is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional 
studies and further studies are not required. Overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate. 
SmPC of the generic product is identical to the reference product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
The impurity profile of applicant’s fingolimod HCL is comparable to that of Gilenya. Thus, additional 
toxicology studies to qualify the impurity profile of the drug product are not required (please see also 
the recommendation in section 2.2.6). 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the absence of non-clinical studies based on 
the literature review and the claim that Fingolimod Accord is a generic of the reference product 
Gilenya. The literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the 
assessment of non-clinical aspects of Fingolimod Accord in the applied indications.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsule, containing fingolimod hydrochloride. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with parallel design under 
fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) and the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09), as well as the product specific guideline Fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg 
product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016) in their current version, are of 
particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study.  
Comparative dissolution profiles between the batches used in the BE study (test product batch R01869 
/ reference product batch S0091) in 3 different media without the addition of 0.2% SLS (0.1N HCl,  pH 
4.5, pH 6.8) / 500 ml, 37±0.5°C, basket apparatus at 100 rpm, have been performed. The dissolution 
profiles in media pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 are found similar between the batches used in the BE study. 
Dissimilarity of the profiles in media 0.1 HCl is not found critical, since bioequivalence was 
demonstrated in vivo and possible reasons for the discrepancy of the in vitro/in vivo data is addressed 
and justified.

Methods 
Study design  
Study  498-14  was  an  open  label,  randomized,  two-treatment  arm,  single  period,  single  oral  dose, 
parallel, bioequivalence study of two products of fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg (administered as 0.5 x 3 
capsules) in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting conditions. The study was conducted in two 
groups on 79 subjects total (40 subjects / test treatment and 39 subjects / reference treatment). Group

II was dosed after completion of clinical phase for group I and after evaluating the safety data from the 
first group. 
Fasting conditions were applied considering that the subjects were housed minimum 11 hours prior to 
drug administration. Subjects were maintained in a fasting state for at least 10 hours prior to dosing and 
for at least 4 hours after dosing.  
As  fingolimod  is  highly  distributed  in  red  blood  cells,  blood  was  used  as  matrix  for  the  evaluation  of 
fingolimod (parent) concentrations. 
As per the protocol, a total of 27 blood samples, each of 03 mL, were to be collected from each subject 
at pre-dose (0 hour) and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 
34, 36, 40, 48 and 72 hours post-dose following drug administration. 
Sampling time schedule is adequate, taking into account long tmax of fingolimod of around 12 - 16 hours 
(Gilenya SmPC). 
Population(s) studied 
Eighty-one non-smoker, healthy, adult, male only volunteers of Asian ethnicity between 18 to 45 years 
of  age  (both  inclusive),  having  a  Body  Mass  Index (BMI)  between  18.5  to  30  kg/m2  (both inclusive), 
having no significant diseases or clinically significant abnormal findings during screening, were enrolled 
in the study.

Two subjects were withdrawn pre-dosing (one on medical grounds and one on his own accord) and one 
post-dosing on medical grounds.  
Seventy-eight subjects had completed the study and were included in the PK and statistical analysis. 
Withdrawal of the subjects was performed according to protocol.  
Analytical methods 
Samples were received at the bioanalytical site on 28-SEP-2015 and 03-OCT-2015 (for Group I) and on 
05-OCT-2015 and 08-OCT-2015 (for Group II).  
Analysis of study samples lasted from 01-OCT-2015 to 14-OCT-2015 (including ISR and repeats). 
Study samples total storage period was 57 days at -65±10°C. Validated long-term stability of drug in 
matrix is 265 days at -65±10°C. 
Validated range was 25.037 to 3005.607 pg/mL and the assay range was 25.039 to 3000.542 pg/mL. 
In-study and Pre-study: 
Analyte: Fingolimod (parent) 
IS: Fingolimod-d4 
Matrix: human blood, anticoagulant K2EDTA 
Extraction Method: Liquid-liquid 
Weighting: 1/concentration2 
Pre-study validation (MV(I)-001-13, 21-OCT-2013) 
Specific  LC-MS/MS  method  for  the  determination  of  fingolimod  in  human  blood  was  developed  at 
Bioanalytical Department of Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. 
The method was validated and met acceptance criteria with respect to: selectivity/specificity, sensitivity, 
linearity/calibration  curve,  within-run  accuracy  and  precision,  between-run  accuracy  and  precision, 
robustness  and  ruggedness,  matrix  effect,  IS-normalised  matrix  factor,  stability  (freeze  and  thaw 
stability, short term stability, analyte stability in matrix, solution stability) and dilution integrity.  
Possibility of back-conversion of the metabolites was examined. It can be concluded that there was no 
interference of metabolites on fingolimod quantification and no back-conversion. 
Pre-study validation was performed according to the requirements of the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical 
method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).  
In-study validation 
The blood samples of subjects were analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method for fingolimod at the 
Bioanalytical facility of Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd., Ahmedabad, India.  
Separately weighed stocks were used for the preparation of calibration curve standards and the quality 
control samples on 29-SEP-2015.  
The analyte was extracted from blood by liquid-liquid extraction method using extraction solution.  
Signed bioanalytical report including statement on GLP, protocol and SOP compliance (12-DEC-2015) 
has been provided. In-study validation was performed according to the requirements of the EMA 
Guideline on bioanalytical method validation EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09.

All samples of one subject were analysed together in one analytical run, a minimum of two quality 
control samples of each QC sample concentration (LQC 74.960 pg/mL, LMQC 348.651 pg/mL, MQC 
1394.602 pg/mL and HQC 2324.337 pg/mL) and eight calibration samples (25.039 to 3000.542 
pg/mL) as well as blank and zero calibrants. 
For the Quality control samples (LQC, LMQC, MQC and HQC), including failed QCs, global accuracy values 
were 99.6%, 100.6%, 99.3% and 99.2%, respectively and global precision values were 8.4%, 6.8%, 
5.1% and 3.4%, respectively. 
Analytical chromatograms from 16 subjects (20%) were included in the dossier.  
ISR  has  been  investigated  satisfactorily.  The  suitability  of  the  method  validation  has been  confirmed. 
Number of QC samples is adequate.  
The reasons for the repeats and the reported values are in line with the SOP LTR.BA-03-01 (for repeat 
analysis)  and  SOP  LTR.BA-02  (section  analytical  run  acceptance  criteria).  The  original  values  repeat 
values and reported values are listed for each repeat sample. 
Thirty-four  individual  samples  were  reanalysed  due  to  significant  variation  in  response  of  IS.  The 
Applicant provided detailed clarification of the reanalysis due to afore mentioned variation as well as the 
possible cause of the two pre-dose study samples that were reanalysed. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the blood concentration vs. time profile by non-
compartmental model using Phoenix® WinNonlin® Professional Software Version 6.4 (Certara L.P.) for 
fingolimod by Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd.  
Actual time points of the sample collection were used.  
Primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  Cmax  and  AUC0-72  and  the  secondary  pharmacokinetic 
parameter was Tmax. 
The pharmacokinetic variables are adequate and in line with the BE-Guideline and Fingolimod capsules 
0.5 mg product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/154812/2016). 
Statistical methods 
Statistical  comparison  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  the  two  formulations  was  carried  out  by 
Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd. using statistical software package PROC MIXED of SAS® Version 9.3 
(SAS Institute Inc., USA). 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) model included Group, Formulation and Group*Formulation as fixed effect.  
ANOVA, power and ratio analysis for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72 are 
computed for fingolimod.  
Group*Formulation  interaction  term  was  found  to  be  statistically  insignificant  for  ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax  and  AUC0-72.  Hence,  this  interaction  term  (Group*formulation)  was 
excluded  from  the  ANOVA  model  and  statistical  analysis  was  re-performed  for  the  ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72, as per protocol. 
The calculation of 90%-confidence intervals is in line with the BE-Guideline.

Results 
The results are summarised in Table 2 and Table 3 below. The test to reference ratio of geometric LS 
means and corresponding 90% confidence interval of the Cmax and AUC0-72 were all within the acceptance 
range of 80.00-125.00%.  
Concentrations for both reference and test drug in pre-dose time point were BLQ. The LLOQ of 25.037 
pg/mL  was  sensitive  enough  to  detect  levels  of  5%  of  the  minimum  Cmax.    Considering  the  sampling 
period of 72 h, and quantifiable concentrations at 72 h, AUC(0-∞) and residual area do not need to be 
reported; it is sufficient to report AUC truncated at 72h, AUC(0-72h).

Given  that  the  applicant  has  used  parallel  design  in  the  BEQ  study,  comparison  between  test  and 
reference with respect to age, height, weight and BMI has been done and provided: 
Table 4

Based  on  the  above  table,  no  statistically  significant  difference  has  been  observed  between  test  and 
reference for Age and Height (p-value > 0.05), while statistically significant difference has been observed 
between test and reference for BMI and Body weight (p-value < 0.05). The applicant performed statistical 
analysis in ANCOVA using body weight (BW) and Body Mass Index (BMI) as covariates with formulation 
as fixed effect. Results showed for formulation no statistical significance for ln-transformed primary PK 
parameters (Cmax and AUC0-72). Additionally, the applicant performed statistical analysis for 90% CI 
calculation  considering  group  and  formulation  as  fixed  effect  and  BW  and  BMI  as  covariates.  Results 
showed for formulation no statistical significance for primary  PK parameters (Cmax and AUC0-72). It 
was also showed that test to reference ratio of geometric LS means and corresponding 90% confidence 
interval of the Cmax and AUC0-72 were all within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when BW and 
BMI were included as covariates.  
Safety data 
Safety was assessed from the screening period to the end of the study. Five (05) AEs were reported in 
subjects after administration of the reference product and five (05) AEs after administration of the test 
product. There were no deaths or serious AEs reported during the conduct of the study. Tolerability of 
the test product was not significantly different from that for the reference product and thus, is acceptable. 
One subject has withdrawn from the study on medical grounds, has received the reference product. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The updated Clinical Overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety of fingolimod is 
adequate.  
The clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. However, the 
innovator is approved in 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg strengths. This generic medicinal product has only been 
developed in the 0.5 mg strength. Therefore, the applicant adjusted the sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the 
SmPC according to the population for which the 0.5 mg formulation is appropriate (patients with body 
weight >40 kg). 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data. The bioequivalence has been 
shown appropriately under fasting conditions between Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules and 
Gilenya 0.5 mg hard capsules. 
The treatment was well tolerated by the subjects enrolled in the study. Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard 
capsules, and Gilenya 0.5 mg hard capsules have similar safety profiles.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 (dated 24 April 2020) is 
acceptable.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Gilenya. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of fingolimod hydrochloride hard capsules. The reference 
product Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis for the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and 
older: 
- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one 
disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
or 
- Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, parallel, randomized, two-
treatment, single period, single oral dose, study of two products of fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/267804/2020  
Page 32/33 
 
 
 
 
(administered as 0.5 x 3 capsules) in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting conditions. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in 
line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time 
as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Fingolimod Accord met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with Gilenya. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, 
e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Fingolimod Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for 
the following groups of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older: 
- 
- 
Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least 
one disease modifying therapy  
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI 
or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

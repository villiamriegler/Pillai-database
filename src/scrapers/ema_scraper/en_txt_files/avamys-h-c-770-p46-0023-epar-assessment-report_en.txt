RECOMMENDATION1 
The  efficacy  data  from  two  presented  studies  in  AR  support  the  current  indication.  It  must  be 
acknowledged  that  safety  data  from  paediatric  population  are  not  complete  because    study  nr 
113342 does not state how many children were included in the study, and there is no summary 
of adverse  events in paediatric population (n=43) in study nr 113203. Summary  of safety from 
other two studies do not reveal any special risk in this population.  The rapporteurs conclude that 
no changes in the product information are required.

2. Clinical studies 
STUDY - FFR113342; A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multi-
Center  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal  Spray  for  2 
Weeks in Chinese Adult and Adolescent subjects with Allergic Rhinitis. 
Methods 
(cid:31) 
This study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Avamys in treatment of Allergic Rhinitis 
(currently approved indication) in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects. 
Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 
• 
Fluticasone furoate, nasal spray 110μg once daily with vehicle placebo nasal spray for 2 weeks 
in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects with Allergic Rhinitis 
Study  design:  This 
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group, 
• 
multicenter,  phase  III  study  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of    Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal 
Spray once-daily, 110μg once daily administered for 2 weeks in Chinese adult and adolescent 
subjects. 
• 
Study population /Sample size: 365 Subjects from 7 sites in China  
Treatments: Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110 μg once daily or placebo nasal spray 
• 
for two weeks. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints: The  primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline 
over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily,  reflective,  total  nasal  symptom  scores  (rTNSS).  The 
mean  change  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  study  in  nasal  finding  score  by  rhinoscopy  was  the 
secondary efficacy endpoint. 
• 
Statistical Methods: The statistical analysis and generation of tables, listings and figures 
were  performed  using  the  SAS  software  package  version  9.1.  Using  a  two-sided  significance 
level of 0.05, the proposed sample size should provide 92% power to detect a difference of 0.9 
between Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray and placebo. 
(cid:31) 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed: A total of 365 subjects were randomized: 181 in FFNS 
• 
and 182 in placebo group. 
Baseline data: At baseline, the mean daily rTNSS was similar between the two treatment 
• 
groups. 
Page 5/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Efficacy results: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the mean change from 
baseline over the entire 2 Weeks treatment period in daily rTNSS. For this endpoint, once daily 
Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110μg was significantly more efficacious in reducing the nasal 
symptoms of AR (rhinorrhea, congestion, itching, sneezing) versus vehicle Placebo nasal spray 
in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects[LS mean difference: -1.498, 95% CI (-1.897, -1.099), 
p<0.0001]. Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110μg was also significantly more efficacious than 
vehicle Placebo nasal spray in the evaluation of nasal finding by rhinoscopy (p<0.0001). 
Page 6/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Safety  results:  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  was  low  in  the  two  treatment 
groups:  7.2%  of  subjects  treated  with  Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal  Spray  110μg  and  4.9%  of 
subjects  treated  with  vehicle  Placebo.  The  most  common  AEs  demonstrated  in  short  term  AR 
studies  conducted  in  the  USA  and  Europe  were  headache,  epistaxis,  and  nasopharyngitis. 
However,  the  AE  profile  observed  in  this  study  was  different.  Rhinalgia  and  dizziness  were 
reported as the most common drug-related AEs in Chinese subjects. 
STUDY-  FFU111439;  A  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Parallel-Group, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Once-Daily Intranasal Administration of 
Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal  Spray  110mcg  in  Adult  and  Adolescent  Subjects    12  years  of  Age 
and Older with Periannial Allergic Rhinitis. 
Methods 
(cid:31) 
This study is for demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Avamys in treatment of Allergic Rhinitis 
(currently approved indication). This Periannial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR) study was  conducted to 
determine  the  efficacy  of  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  for  the  treatment  of  ocular  symptoms 
associated with PAR. 
Page 7/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 4 
weeks  of  treatment  with  intranasal  fluticasone  furoate  110  mcg  once  daily  and  placebo  nasal 
spray in subjects ≥12 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. 
Study  design:  This  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group, 
• 
multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of FFNS. 
Study  population  /Sample  size:  288  subjects  from  30  -  40  investigative  sites  in  North 
• 
America, Europe, and the Russian Federation. 
• 
Treatments:  once-daily,  intranasal  administration  of  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110 
mcg or placebo administered for 4 weeks in adult and adolescent subjects (12 years of age and 
older) with PAR. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints: The primary efficacy measure for the study was the mean change 
from  baseline  over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily  reflective  total  nasal  symptom  scores 
(rTNSS).  Key  secondary  measures  were  the  mean  change  from  baseline  over  the  entire 
treatment  period  in  morning  pre-dose  instantaneous  total  nasal  symptom  scores  (iTNSS)  and 
the mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in daily, reflective, total ocular 
symptom scores (rTOSS). 
Statistical  Methods:  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  served  as  a  gatekeeper  for  the 
• 
interpretation  of  treatment  comparisons  for  the  key  secondary  efficacy  and  health  outcomes 
endpoints. If H0 was rejected at the 0.05 level for the primary efficacy endpoint, the conclusion 
would  be  there  was  a  difference  between  fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110  mcg  once  daily 
and  placebo,  and  the  p-values  for  the  key  secondary  efficacy  and  health  outcomes  endpoints 
would be interpreted according to the rules for multiplicity adjustment.Using a two-sample t-test 
with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, the proposed sample size should provide 90% power 
to detect a difference of 1.0 between active treatment and placebo. 
(cid:31) 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed: A total of 509 subjects were screened for this study. The 
• 
ITT population comprised 315 subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
study medication (160 in FFNS group and 155 – placebo). Total number of participants in age 
between  12  to  18  yrs  was  18  (9  in  FFNS  and  9  in  placebo  group).  A  total  of  96%  of  subjects 
completed the study. 
• 
Baseline  data:  The  majority  of  subjects  had  reported  having  PAR  for  ≥10  years  (61%  - 
68%).Mean scores over the four 24-hour periods prior to randomization for the total nasal, nasal 
congestion, and total ocular symptom scores were similar between the two treatment groups 
• 
Efficacy results:  In daily rTNSS the treatment difference between fluticasone furoate 110 
mcg and placebo was significant for study weeks 2, 3, and 4, but not for Week 1. The LS mean 
differences ranged from -0.223 (Week 1; p=0.326) to -0.937 (Week 4; p=0.005). Over the entire 
treatment  period  in  daily  rTOSS  the  treatment  difference  between  fluticasone  furoate  110  mcg 
and placebo was not significant for any study week. 
Page 8/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS over the 4-week treatment period was greater 
for fluticasone furoate 110 mcg than for placebo in each age group: the 12 to <18 years group    
(-2.8 [fluticasone furoate 110 mcg], -1.7 [placebo]), the 18 to <65 years group (-3.0 [fluticasone 
furoate 110 mcg], -2.3 [placebo]), and the ≥65 years group (-3.9 [fluticasone furoate 110 mcg],    
-1.2 [placebo]). However, the sample sizes for the 12 to <18 years and ≥65 years groups were 
too small to make meaningful comparisons. 
Safety results: Sixty-seven subjects (42%) in the fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group and 
• 
52 subjects (34%) in the placebo group experienced at least one AE during the treatment period. 
The  most  common  drug-related  AE,  epistaxis,  was  reported  by  19  subjects  (12%)  in  the 
fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group and 6 subjects (4%) in the placebo group. One subject (<1%) 
in fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group and two subjects (1%) in the placebo group reported drug-
related  events  of  nasal  septum  ulceration  or  nasal  ulcer.  No  SAEs  were  reported  during  the 
study.

STUDY  -  FFR111158;  A  Pilot,  Randomised,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled,  Parallel  group, 
Multi-centre Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Once-daily Intranasal Administration of 
Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal  Spray  110  mcg  for  4  Weeks  in  Adults  and  Adolescents  with  Irritant 
(Non-Allergic) Rhinitis. 
(cid:31) 
Description: This study is a pilot trial in new indication for the product Avamys: treatment 
of  Irritant  (Non-Allergic)  Rhinitis  (IR).  Non-allergic  rhinitis  is  characterized  by  sporadic  or 
persistent  perennial  symptoms  that  do  not  result  from  events  mediated  by  immunoglobulin  E 
(IgE).  Additionally,  non-allergic  rhinitis  can  be  sub-classified  into  infectious  rhinitis,  vasomotor 
rhinitis  (VMR),  occupational/irritant  rhinitis,  hormonal  rhinitis,  drug-induced  rhinitis,  gustatory 
rhinitis,  and  non-allergic  rhinitis  with  eosinophilia  syndrome  (NARES).  The  sub-class  of  irritant 
rhinitis can be caused by a variety of irritant triggers which include environmental factors, such 
as physical and/or chemical compounds in the air. 
(cid:31) 
Methods 
• 
Objective:  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110  mcg  once  daily  with  placebo  nasal  spray  in  subjects  with 
irritant (nonallergic) rhinitis triggered predominantly by air pollution. 
Study  design:  This  was  a  4-week,  Phase  II,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
• 
controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study conducted in Thailand. 
• 
Study population /Sample size: Approximately 100 subjects (50 per arm) were planned to 
be  randomized  in  each  of  the  two  treatment  groups  (fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110  mcg 
once daily and placebo nasal spray).  
Page 10/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  sample  size  was  based  on  the  estimation  that  the  distance  from  the  mean  to  the  limit  (½ 
width)  of  the  95  %  confidence  interval  for  the  treatment  effect  was  no  larger  than  0.666, 
assuming  a  standard  deviation  of  1.7  based  on  previous  VMR  studies  with  fluticasone  furoate 
where the same assessment ratings were used. 
• 
Treatments: FFNS 110mcg QD or placebo for 4 weeks. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline 
over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily  rTNSS  (  reflective  total  nasal  symptoms  score)  as 
evaluated  on  a  4-point  categorical  scale.  A  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  mean 
change from baseline over the entire treatment period in AM pre-dose iTNSS (instantantaneous 
TNSS). 
Statistical  Methods:  No  formal  statistical  hypotheses  were  tested.  The  analysis  method 
• 
used for comparison of the two treatment groups was ANCOVA. 
(cid:31) 
Results 
Recruitment/  Number  analysed:  One  hundred  two  (102)  subjects  were  randomized  into 
• 
the study, including only three adolescent patients. 
• 
Baseline data: At baseline, the mean daily rTNSS were similar for both treatment groups. 
Efficacy results: 
• 
For primary endpoint, a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups was 
not demonstrated (LS mean difference was -0.0655; p=0.845). For the key secondary endpoint, 
mean change from baseline in the morning (pre-dose) instantaneous total nasal symptom score 
(AM  pre-dose  iTNSS),  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  also  not  seen  between  the  two 
groups (LS mean difference was -0.075; p=0.827).

Safety results: The safety findings of this study showed fluticasone furoate 110mcg once 
• 
daily  to  be  well  tolerated.  Cough,  migraine,  nasal  ulcer,  and  epistaxis  were  the  most  common 
AEs that occurred during the treatment period (≥3% incidence and more common than placebo) 
however these numbers were low, comparatively, due to the small population (N=102).

  Description 
This  study  is  a  trial  in  a  new  indication  for  the  product  Avamys:  uncomplicated  acute 
rhinosinusitis (ARS).  ARS was definied as a clinically-diagnosed inflammatory condition of the 
upper respiratory tract lasting less than 4 weeks. Uncomplicated RS may be further classified by 
a  critical  assessment  of  the  duration  and  pattern  (e.g.,  improving,  persistent,  worsening)  of 
symptoms including nasal congestion, nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), and facial 
pain/pressure. Patients with ARS generally have one of the following two clinical presentations 
(persistent  or  worsening)  consistent  with  uncomplicated  ARS:  symptoms  or  signs  of  acute  RS 
persist ≥10 days beyond onset or symptoms or signs of acute RS worsen within 5-10 days after 
an initial improvement. ARS patients with fever >38°C and severe pain were classified as having 
fulminant bacterial rhinosinusitis (FBRS) were excluded from the study. Subjects who developed 
FBRS during the study were withdrawn and were treated with an antibiotic. 
  Methods 
  Objective:  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  two 
doses of FFNS (110 mcg once daily and 110 mcg twice daily) compared with placebo as 
monotherapy in the treatment of adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older 
with uncomplicated ARS. 
  Study  design:  This  was  a  Phase  IIb,  randomized  in  3  groups,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. 
  Study population /Sample size: A total of 1023 subjects were screened for this study. 
  Treatment: Treatment in 3 Groups for 2-week treatment period: 
-  FFNS 110mcg QD (morning) and placebo (evening); 
-  FFNS 110mcg BID (morning and evening); 
-  Placebo (morning and evening).  
  Outcomes/endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline in 
sinus 
(MSS: 
daily  Major  Symptoms  Score 
headache/pressure or facial pain/pressure, and postnasal drip ) over the entire treatment 
period (Weeks 1-2). First time to symptom improvement was the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint. 
congestion/stuffiness, 
nasal 
  Statistical Methods: Analysis performed using ANCOVA with baseline value, country, AR 
status,  age,  and  gender  as  covariates.  Age  and  AR  status  were  based  on  subject 
demographics and baseline characteristics captured on the eCRF.  
  Results 
  Recruitment/  Number  analysed:  The  ITT  Population  included  737  subjects:  245  in  the 
placebo group, 240 in the FFNS 110 mcg QD group, and 252 in the FFNS 110 mcg BID 
group.  Children  aged  from  12  to  18  yr.  compromised  43  subjects  (6%):  14;  14  and  15 
according the treatment group. The majority of subjects in each treatment group (≥93%) 
completed the 2-week study. 
  Baseline data 
Page 13/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Efficacy results: Based on the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline 
over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily  MSS,  the  study  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant  treatment  benefit  of  FFNS  compared  with  placebo  in  reducing  the  overall 
symptoms  of  uncomplicated  ARS  for  both  BID  and  QD  dosing  regimens  (LS  mean 
differences  vs.  placebo  of  -0.357  [p=0.014]  and  -0.386  [p=0.008]  for  BID  and  QD, 
respectively).  Between  the  two  FFNS  doses  investigated,  a  dose  response  was  not 
observed.  
The  key  secondary  endpoint,  first  time  to  symptom  improvement,  did  not  provide 
supporting  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  FFNS  in  subjects  with  uncomplicated  ARS.  The 
difference in the median time to symptom improvement between each regimen of FFNS 
and placebo was 1 day (8 days for the placebo group and 7 days for each FFNS group) 
and it was not statistically significant. 
Page 14/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Safety results: The incidence of AEs during the treatment period was similar across the 
three  treatment  groups  (17-18%)  (Table  16).  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidence  of  AEs 
(≥5%  in  at  least  one  treatment  group)  included  Infections  and  Infestations  (5-6%), 
Nervous System Disorders (2-6%), and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders 
(4-5%).  The  incidence  of  nervous  system  disorders  was  slightly  higher  in  the  FFNS 
groups (4% QD, 6% BID) compared with the placebo group (2%). 
Most  of  the  AEs  reported  during  this  study  occurred  in  subjects  ≥18  years  old:  17%  placebo, 
18% FFNS 110 mcg QD, and 19% FFNS 110 mcg BID  and were similar to the ITT Population. 
Four  subjects  in  the  adolescent  age  group  (n=43)  reported  AEs  which  included  headache  (1 
subject  in  the  placebo  group  and  2  subjects  in  the  FFNS  110  mcg  BID  group)  and  gastritis  (1 
subject in the FFNS 110 mcg QD group). 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
STUDY- FFU111439 -  
Results  of  this  study  showed  once-daily  fluticasone  furoate  110  mcg  aqueous  nasal  spray 
produced  greater  reductions  from  baseline  in  subjects’  self-assessed,  allergy  nasal  symptom 
scores as compared with placebo nasal spray. These reductions were inferentially significant for 
the  primary  endpoint  (rTNSS)  as  well  as  for  the  key  secondary  nasal  symptom  endpoint 
(iTNSS).  
A significant difference between the study treatments was not seen for the key secondary ocular 
symptom  endpoint  (rTOSS)  or  for  other  ocular  symptom  endpoints,  including  any  of  the  three 
individual ocular symptoms (eyes itching/burning, eyes tearing/watering, and eye redness). 
The summary of AE for age group 12 to <18 (n=9) was presented.

STUDY - FFR113342 –  
The  efficacy  results  in  this  study  were  similar  to  the  studies  conducted  in  USA,  Europe,  and 
Japan. There are not specified efficacy and safety data on participants by age group. 
STUDY FFR111158 - 
This pilot study demonstrated a lack of efficacy of FFNS in the treatment of IR developed by air 
pollution in Bangkok. The safety findings of this study showed fluticasone furoate 110mcg once 
daily  to  be  well  tolerated  in  population  included  to  the  study.  Only  three  participants  were 
adolescent (12-18 yrs). 
STUDY FFS113203 –  
Due to small number of participants aged 12-18 yrs (n=43) the results did not provide supporting 
evidence for the efficacy of the product in the treatment of uncomplicated ARS in this population. 
The safety data for this population collected in this study confirmed known safety profile of FFNS 
without any unexpected adverse event.

RAPPORTEUR’S 
RECOMMENDATION 
OVERALL 
CONCLUSION 
AND 
  Overall conclusion 
The  efficacy  data  from  two  presented  studies  in  AR  support  the  current  indication.  It  must  be 
acknowledged  that  safety  data  from  paediatric  population  are  not  complete  because    study  nr 
113342 does not state how many children were included in the study, and there is no summary 
of adverse  events in paediatric population (n=43) in study nr 113203. Summary  of safety from 
other two studies do not reveal any special risk in this population.  The rapporteurs conclude that 
no changes in the product information are required. 
No further action required

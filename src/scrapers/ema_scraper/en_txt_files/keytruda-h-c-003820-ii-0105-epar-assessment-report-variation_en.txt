2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Advanced endometrial carcinoma following progression to platinum-based chemotherapy.   
The MAH applied for an extension of indication for Keytruda in combination with lenvatinib in second line 
endometrial carcinoma patients: 
“Keytruda in combination with lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced 
endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting 
and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation (see section 5.1).“ 
Finally approved indication is as follows: 
Endometrial carcinoma (EC) 
Keytruda, in combination with lenvatinib, is indicated for the treatment of advanced or recurrent 
endometrial carcinoma in adults who have disease progression on or following prior treatment with a 
platinum-containing therapy in any setting and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Endometrial  cancer  is  the  sixth  most  common  cancer  among  women  worldwide1 and  the  most  common 
gynaecological cancer in developed countries. The estimated number of new cases and deaths from EC in 
2018  were  121,600  and  26,000,  respectively2.  More  than  90%  of  cases  of  endometrial  cancer  occur  in 
women >50 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years.  
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Adenocarcinoma  of  the  endometrium  is  the  most  common  histologic  type  of  uterine  cancer,  historically 
classified into two main clinico-pathological and molecular types: type I is more common (70-80%) and 
less  aggressive  composed  by  endometrioid  histology,  and  type  II  comprises  non-endometrioid  subtypes 
(serous,  clear-cell  and  undifferentiated  carcinomas,  carcinosarcoma/malignant-mixed  Müllerian  tumour), 
typically with poorer prognosis and not clearly associated with estrogen stimulation3.  
Four clinically significant molecular subtypes with differing clinical prognoses have been identified: (i) POLE 
(ultra-mutated)tumours,  (ii)  microsatellite  unstable  tumours  (MSI-H),  (iii)  copy-number  low  (iv)  copy 
number high4.  
EC  is  one  of  the  cancers  with  a  high  observed  rate  of  dMMR/MSI-H  (average  of  approximately  34%). 
Microsatellite  instability  is  a  result  of  the  inability  of  DNA  mismatch  repair  enzymes  to  repair  random 
mutations leading to tumorigenesis. Approximately 15% patients with previously treated EC have tumors 
that are MSI-H or dMMR5. 
Most patients with endometrial cancer have an identifiable source of excess oestrogen and typically display 
a characteristic clinical profile comprising a high body mass index, often with other components of metabolic

syndrome (e.g. hypertension, diabetes), correlating with good prognostic features of endometrial cancer, 
including low tumour grade, endometrioid histology and presentation at early stage6. Tumours associated 
with  mismatch  repair  abnormalities  and  Lynch  Syndrome  appear  to  be  distinct,  with  worse  prognostic 
factors and worse clinical outcome7. Other risk factors for endometrial cancer include unopposed oestrogen 
therapy, oestrogen-producing tumours and early menarche/late menopause. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most of endometrial cancer patients have localized disease (67%), while 21% have regional disease, and 
approximately  9%  have  distant  metastases.  The  prognosis  for  EC  is  significantly  influenced  by  disease 
stage. Patients with localized disease have a 5-year survival rate of 95%, whereas those with regional and 
distant metastatic disease have 5-year survival rates of 69% and 16.8%, respectively8. Approximately 20% 
of EC cases recur with poor prognosis9. The population of patients with recurrent EC is heterogeneous in 
terms of histological subtypes and grades, stages at initial diagnosis, prior therapy, duration of recurrence-
free intervals and sites of recurrence (distal or local)10. In general, the median survival of patients with 
recurrent or advanced disease is 12 months11.   
Management 
Treatment of EC may vary depending on the grade, histology, stage of the disease, and MSI/MMR status. 
Currently,  the  mainstay  of  treatment  of  EC  is  surgery  with  hysterectomy  and  bilateral  salpingo-
oophorectomy; based on the risk stratification, adjuvant treatment including brachyterapy, external beam 
pelvic RT, and/or chemotherapy are used12.  
Patients with advanced disease (defined as bulky FIGO stage IIIA-IV), or recurrent disease should only be 
considered for surgery if it is anticipated that cytoreduction with no macroscopic residual disease can be 
achieved. RT can be used as a primary treatment in patients with unresectable disease, or where there are 
medical contraindications to surgery14.  
Hormonal therapy is indicated for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer and endometrioid 
histology.  Response  to  hormonal  therapy  is  quite  variable,  according  to  e.g.  pathological  factors,  for 
example, hormonal therapy is more likely to be effective in grade 1 or 2 endometrioid tumours. Positivity 
of  ER  and/or  PgR  could  be  a  predictive  factor  of  response  to  endocrine  therapy.  Hormone  therapy 
(progestogens are generally recommended) is the preferred 1L systemic treatment for front-line hormone 
receptor-positive grade 1 or 2 tumours in the absence of rapidly progressive disease14. 
Endometrial cancer is a relatively chemo-sensitive disease, with anthracyclines, platinum-based drugs and 
taxanes  shown  to  be  the  most  active  agents.  According  to  ESMO  guidelines,  the  standard  of  care  is 
carboplatin and paclitaxel as first line treatment14. Per NCCN guidelines, platinum-based chemotherapy is 
the  standard  first-line  systemic  therapy  for  patients  with  metastatic,  recurrent,  or  high-risk  disease 13.

Evidence  supporting  the  use  of  second-line  chemotherapy  after  platinum-containing  therapy  in  patients 
with  endometrial  cancer  is  limited,  especially  when  the  treatment-free  interval  following  first-line 
chemotherapy is <6–12 months, and no specific regimen can be recommended as a standard of care for 
second-line chemotherapy. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are considered the most active therapies. In patients 
with a long platinum-free interval, reintroduction of platinum can be considered14.  
Cytotoxic chemotherapy as second-line treatment for advanced EC is associated with low response rates (
≤ 15%), limited PFS (4 months), and toxicity14.

In the EU, the anti-PD1 antibody Jemperli (dostarlimab) has been approved in 2021 for the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  mismatch  repair  deficient  (dMMR)/microsatellite  instability-high  (MSI-H)  recurrent  or 
advanced  endometrial  cancer  (EC)  that has  progressed  on  or  following  prior  treatment  with  a platinum-
containing regimen. In countries other than EU, pembrolizumab as monotherapy is approved for a selected 
subset of patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors including those with EC.

Lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab received accelerated, conditional, or provisional approval in 
the US, Canada, and Australia for the treatment of patients with advanced EC that is not MSI-H or dMMR 
who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery 
or radiation, based on the results of the single-arm phase 1b/2 Study 111/KEYNOTE-146. On July 2021, 
FDA granted regular approval to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib for the above indication in patients that is 
not MSI-H or dMMR who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are 
not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, based on Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) 
receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator 
of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Keytruda 
potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 
and  PD-L2,  which  are  expressed  in  antigen presenting  cells  and  may  be  expressed  by  tumours  or other 
cells in the tumour microenvironment. Keytruda is approved in EU as monotherapy in melanoma, NSCLC, 
HNSCC,  cHL,  urothelial  carcinoma,  and  colorectal  cancer  MSI-H.  It  is  approved  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy  in  NSCLC,  HNSCC,  oesophageal  carcinoma  and  triple  negative  breast  cancer.  It  is  also 
approved in combination with a TKI (axitinib) in RCC.  
Lenvatinib is a TKI active against both VEGFR (1,2,3,4) and FGFR (1,2,3,4). It also inhibits other RTKs 
that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to 
their normal cellular functions, including the PDGFRα, KIT, and RET.  
Lenvatinib  is  known  as  LENVIMA,  which  is  currently  authorised  as  monotherapy  for  differentiated 
(papillary/follicular/Hürthle  cell)  thyroid  carcinoma  and  for  hepatocellular  carcinoma,  and  as  KISPLYX, 
indicated in combination with everolimus for renal cell carcinoma.

Scientific Advice was given by CHMP to Eisai Limited (MAH of lenvatinib) on the design of the pivotal Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775  (EMEA/H/SA/1375/6/2017/II  SA).  CHMP  generally  agreed  with  the  proposed  study 
design. Main comments were the following: 
- The CHMP suggested to include ECOG PS2 patients, as inclusion of only patients with ECOG PS 0 or 1 
would preclude a significant number of real-world endometrial cancer patients being treated in second-line 
setting.  This  was  however  not  followed.  As  discussed  below,  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  of  Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775 reflect only the fitter subpopulation with diagnosis of advanced endometrial carcinoma.  
-  PFS  did  not  seem  acceptable  as  a  primary  endpoint.  Given  the  dismal  prognosis  of  this  condition  and 
considering that no further efficient options would confound OS, there are no reasons to justify using PFS 
for a decision if an effect on OS is not established. In this study, PFS and OS are dual primary endpoints. 
Within this submission, both PFS and OS reached statistical significance at IA1.  
-  With  regard  to  contribution  of  component,  the  provided  information  at  that  time  seem  to  support  the 
hypothesis of synergism; the proposed study and with an outcome of positive risk-benefit would in principle 
support a MAA, provided the guidance for one pivotal trial applications is respected. 
A  presubmission  meeting  was  held  with  the  EMA  and  EU  (Co)Rapporteurs  for  both  lenvatinib  and 
pembrolizumab  on  03-FEB-2021,  where  results  from  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  were  presented  and 
discussed in view of the planned Type II variation applications.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The  MAH  claimed  that  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP,  and  that  trials  carried  out 
outside of the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. The assessment of 
Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  data  did  not  raise  concern  over  GCP  compliance  leading  to  request  for  GCP 
inspection. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP (please refer to the EPAR for Keytruda procedure number EMA/H/C/003820/II/0104). 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an ERA has 
not been submitted. This is considered acceptable. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP (please refer to the EPAR for Keytruda procedure number EMA/H/C/003820/II/0104). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Analysis started on 14-Aug-2019 and ended on 26-Nov-2020. 
Frozen samples with dry ice still present, were shipped to the bioanalytical laboratory; then, were stored 
at approximately -20ºC until analyzed. As declared in the BA report, 4423 samples were received and 2452 
were analysed. 
The same analytical methodology was used across all lenvatinib assay validation and sample analysis, as 
shown in the table below. 
Prior to each run, the suitability of the instrument was demonstrated through the injection of a system 
suitability test. Furthermore, to verify that the performance of each instrument was comparable during 
sample analysis, the QC results from each run were grouped by instrument and examined. Results 
confirm that each instrument generated comparable data during the course of study sample analysis.

Pharmacokinetic in target population 
An overview of the lenvatinib clinical pharmacology study for this extension of indication in EC patients is 
presented below: 
Table 1 - Clinical Pharmacology Studies : Definitive Pharmacokinetics in Patients 
Blood samples from all participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (Arm A) were collected as 
specified in the protocol of Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 at Cycle 1 Day1, Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1 
(see scheme here below).

Plasma  concentrations  of  lenvatinib  were  measured.  Lenvatinib  was  analyzed  using  a  population  PK 
approach. 
Lenvatinib  was  quantified  by  use  of  validated  High-Performance  Liquid  Chromatography  tandem  mass 
spectroscopy method.  
Plasma concentrations of Pembrolizumab were not measured within this study. 
Results of the PK evaluation for lenvatinib are provided in a standalone report (Population Analysis CPMS-
E7080-015P-v1).  
Population PK Analysis  
Report CPMS-E7080-015R-v1 describes objectives, methods and results of the population PK analysis of 
lenvatinib using data pooled across several studies, including Study KN-775/309. This report also includes 
PK/safety analyses (Study KN-775/309/Arm A) in subjects with EC. 
The objective of the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of lenvatinib is: 
• Compare the PK of lenvatinib in subjects with advanced EC (Study KN-775/309) to that in subjects with 
other types of cancer across available studies of the lenvatinib clinical program and assess the effect of 
concomitant pembrolizumab on the PK of lenvatinib. 
The objective of the PK/safety analysis of combination therapy of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in subjects 
with EC is: 
•  Explore  the  relationship  of  lenvatinib  exposure  vs  the  occurrence  of  TEAEs  related/specific  to  only 
lenvatinib  in  subjects  with  EC  and  which  were  previously  specified  to  include  hypertension,  proteinuria, 
weight decreased, vomiting, and hypothyroidism. 
The updated Population PK analysis was performed using data from Study KN775/309 in subjects with EC 
pooled with data from Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and Phase 1, 2 and/or 3 studies in subjects 
with other solid tumors, for a total of 22 studies. Exposure-response analysis for adverse events related to 
lenvatinib only was performed using data from Study 309/Arm A in subjects with EC.  
To simplify PK model development, and focus on therapeutically relevant exposures, only PK data following 
lenvatinib doses of 3.2 mg and above were included in the analysis. 
A brief description of the studies included in the popPK analysis is presented below.

For lenvatinib population PK analysis, data were included if subjects received at least 1 dose of lenvatinib 
and had at least one adequately documented and quantifiable plasma concentration.  
The final pooled lenvatinib PK dataset included 25738 observations from a total of 3025 subjects. For Study 
KN775/309 EC subjects, there were 2178 lenvatinib concentrations available from 403 subjects, with all 
403 EC subjects receiving concomitant pembrolizumab. 
For PK/safety analyses of AEs, 403 subjects with EC from the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab combination arm 
(Arm  A)  from  Study  KN775/309  with  PK  information  and  who  have  at  least  one  post-baseline  safety 
evaluation were included in the analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic Model Development 
The analysis of lenvatinib total plasma concentration data from Study KN775/309 (Arm A) was pooled with 
existing PK dataset consisting of pooled data from several Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and Phase 
1, 2 and 3 studies in subjects with solid tumors, which was previously described in report CPMS-E7080-
013R).  This  popPK  model included  21  studies:  E7080-A001-001  to  008,  E7080-E044-101,  E7080-A001-
102,  E7080-  J081-103&105,  E7080-J081-112,  E7080-G000-201,  E7080-J081-202,  E7080-G000-205, 
E7080-G000-303, E7080-G000-304, E7080-G000- 211, E7080-M000-221, and E7080-G000-218 
Lenvatinib  PK  was  best  described  by  a  3-compartment  model  with  simultaneous  first  and  zero  order 
absorption  and  linear  elimination  from  the  central  compartment  parameterized  for  apparent  plasma 
clearance  of  drug  after  oral  administration  (CL/F),  apparent  volume  of  the  central  compartment  (V1/F), 
Assessment report  
EMA/617606/2021 
Page 20/170 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
apparent  volume  of  peripheral  compartments  (V2/F  and  V3/F),  inter-compartmental  clearance  between 
V1/F and V2/F and V1/F and V3/F (Q2/F and Q3/F), absorption rate constant (Ka), and duration of zero-
order absorption (D1) and relative bioavailability (F1rel).  
PK model included the following covariates: body weight on clearances and volume parameters, healthy 
subjects on CL/F, RCC and HCC subjects on CL/F, albumin < 30 g/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > upper 
limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F, and capsule formulation on relative bioavailability. 
In the current analysis, due to the large dataset which resulted in a very long run time, Ka, D1, F1rel, V3/F 
and effect of healthy subjects and CYP3A inhibitors on CL/F were similar to those from many previous PK 
analyses. As such, these parameters were fixed to those from the recent PK analysis (CPMS-E7080-013R) 
and only effects of albumin, ALP and tumor type were re-evaluated in the PK model in addition to the effect 
of  sex  and  co-medication  of  pembrolizumab  (categorical)  on  CL/F.  Estimation  of  model  parameters  was 
performed using first order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). 
The  final  population  PK  model  was  used  to  derive  individual  PK  parameters  and  lenvatinib  exposure  in 
subjects from Study KN775/309. These data were then merged with safety dataset for AEs. Lenvatinib AUC 
at steady state based on the starting dose was derived as follows: 
Individual clearance is the model predicted individual apparent clearance and F1 is relative bioavailability 
of capsule to tablet formulation 
PK Model Acceptability Criteria 
The following criteria were considered when assessing the acceptability of a model: 
  A “minimization successful” statement by the NONMEM program. 
  Covariance step terminates without any warning message. 
  The number of significant digits should be ≥ 3 for all estimated θ values. 
  Final estimates of θ values should not be close to the initial estimate boundaries. 
  The standard error of θ estimates should be less than 20% and the standard error of 
  η estimates should be less than 50% of the estimate itself. 
  Correlation between parameters less than 0.95. 
In addition, the following goodness-of-fit-plots were used to evaluate the ability of the model 
to describe the available data which demonstrate no systematic trends: 
  Population and individual predictions versus observations 
  Conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) versus population predictions (PRED) and versus time 
Covariate PK Model Development 
In the current PK analysis of lenvatinib, a full covariate model was fitted to the pooled PK dataset which 
included known fixed covariate effects (formulation on F1 and of CYP3A inhibitors and healthy subjects on 
CL/F), and effects of sex, ALP, albumin, tumor type and co-medication with pembrolizumab (categorical) 
on CL/F. No backwards deletion was carried out.  
Final PK Model Evaluation 
VISUAL PREDICTIVE CHECK: The final PK of lenvatinib model was evaluated using pcVPC constructed using 
PSN (Bergstrand, et al, 2011). Using parameters from the final PK model, lenvatinib concentrations were

simulated over (N = 250) dataset using original dosing history and covariate information. The median and 
5th  and  95th  simulated  percentiles  (90%  prediction  interval  [PI])  of  were  calculated  and  plotted  with 
observed lenvatinib concentration data. 
BOOTSTRAP  METHODS:  The  final  PK  model  for  lenvatinib  was  evaluated  using  bootstrap  re-sampling  to 
construct nonparametric parameter summaries including confidence intervals (Yafune and Ishiguro, 1999) 
PK/Safety Model Development 
The  relationship  of  event  probabilities  corresponding  to  grades  of  treatment  emergent  adverse  events 
(TEAEs)  and  lenvatinib  exposure  were  evaluated  using  a  proportional  odds  model.  Lenvatinib  exposures 
corresponded to lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination arm (Study KN775/309 Arm A) with starting 
dose Auks lenvatinib exposure used for analysis. 
For each AE, probabilities of having no AE and a Grade 1, 2 or 3 AE was estimated as a function of lenvatinib 
exposure. The following TEAEs were analyzed: hypertension, proteinuria, weight decreased, vomiting and 
hypothyroidism 
For these TEAEs, lenvatinib AUC (AUCLEN) was tested as drug effect. These exposure effects were modeled 
as  log-transformed  values.  The  effects  of  the  following  covariates  were  tested  in  this  multivariate  TEAE 
analysis; age category (≥65 years vs < 65 years), ECOG-PS (1 vs 0), and a parameter for Japanese study 
participants vs. others (PTSeth). The full (prespecified) model approach was considered for all TEAEs. This 
proportional-odds  cumulative  logit  model  employed  logit-transformation  to  constrain  estimated 
probabilities between 0 and 1, using: 
where  fi  represents  logit  functions  of  the  cumulative  probability  that  CTC  grade  is  ≥  i  =  1,  2,  or  3  and 
effects of predictors: 
where Bi representing the baseline probabilities for the different CTC grades (on a logit scale). The function 
f (predictors) is function of log-linear lenvatinib exposure and the effect of covariates with the structural 
form below: 
RESULTS 
Datasets: The final pooled lenvatinib PK dataset included 25738 observations from a total of 3025 subjects. 
For  EC  subjects,  there  were  2178  lenvatinib  concentrations  available  from  403  subjects  from  Study 
KN775/309.  All  403  EC  subjects  received  concomitant  pembrolizumab.  Additional  data  from  another  5 
subjects were excluded from the analysis as these data were causing numerical difficulties. 
PK/safety dataset for AEs included 403 data records of each adverse event from 403 subjects with EC from 
the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab combination arm (Arm A) from Study KN775/309.

PK Model results for Lenvatinib 
The final PK model was a 3-compartment model with simultaneous zero and first order absorption and first 
order elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL/F, V1/F, V2/F, V3/F, Q1, Q2, Ka, D1, 
and F1rel for capsule formulation compared to tablet. 
The  full  covariate  model  included  body  weight  as  an  allometric  constant  on  clearances  and  volume 
parameters,  albumin  <  30  g/L  and  ALP  >  ULN  on  CL/F,  and  concomitant  CYP3A4  inhibitors  on  CL/F. 
Lenvatinib CL/F differences for EC, DTC, RCC, HCC and healthy subjects, as well as sex and concomitant 
pembrolizumab were also included in the full covariate model. The parameter estimates, precision of the 
estimate  and  95%  confidence  intervals  for  the  final  lenvatinib  PK  model  are  presented  in  the  following 
table:

All the parameters of the structural model were estimated with a %RSE ≤ 3.76%. Lenvatinib CL/F increased 
with increasing body weight (power = 0.75), decreased by 14.4% with albumin levels below 30 g/L and 
decreased by 6.1% with ALP above upper limit of normal (ULN). 
The  EC  population  was  estimated  with  a  24.9%  lower  lenvatinib  CL/F  compared  with  other  solid  tumor 
types excluding DTC, RCC and HCC. The DTC population was noted to have similar lenvatinib CL/F to that 
in patients with other solid tumor types (0.970; 95% CI: 0.918 – 1.02) excluding EC, RCC and HCC. The 
RCC population was found to have a 19.8% lower lenvatinib CL/F compared with other solid tumor types 
excluding EC, DTC and HCC. 
The  HCC  population  was  found  to  have  a  17.6%  lower  lenvatinib  CL/F  compared  with other  solid  tumor 
types excluding EC, DTC and RCC. The effects of DTC, RCC and HCC on CL/F are comparable with those 
from a recent PK analyses (CPMS-E7080-013R and CPMSE7080- 012R-LP-v1). Lenvatinib CL/F was found 
to be 7% higher with concomitant pembrolizumab and to be 11.4% lower in females compared to males. 
The magnitude of each effect is within the inter-subject variability for CL/F (33.5 %) and hence of no clinical 
relevance. 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) in the model parameters was moderate to high ranging between 33.5% for 
CL/F and 104% for D1. IIV was well estimated with good precision for all the parameters (%RSE ≤ 12.5%). 
The proportional residual variability in lenvatinib concentrations for TAD ≤ 2 h was moderate (%CV=48.5), 
moderate for cancer patient studies (%CV=40.2), and low for Phase 1 studies with full profiles (%CV=16.6).

While the effect of concomitant pembrolizumab on lenvatinib PK was found to be statistically significantly 
higher (by 7%), this effect is small and of no clinical relevance, as demonstrated graphically in the figure 
reported  below.  The  figure  depicts  a  major  overlap  in  lenvatinib  CL/F  with  and  without  concomitant 
pembrolizumab. The effect of concomitant pembrolizumab depicted below is based on comparisons of data 
from EC subjects from Studies KN775/309 and RCC subjects from Study 307/Arm B receiving lenvatinib + 
pembrolizumab with data from HCC subjects from Studies 202 and 304 receiving lenvatinib monotherapy

The dataset contained 52 Japanese, 2 Chinese and 31 Asians other than Chinese or Japanese. The median 
and range of parameter values for these populations are comparable with White/Others receiving lenvatinib 
20 mg in combination with pembrolizumab in Study KN775/309. Additionally, the results are depicted as 
boxplots in figures below, and demonstrated a major overlap for both CL/F and AUC (20 mg) between Asian

PK/Safety Analyses 
Lenvatinib  population  PK  model  was  used  to  derive  individual  PK  parameters  and  resulting  lenvatinib 
exposure (AUC) in subjects from Study KN775/309. This lenvatinib exposure measure was based on the 
starting  treatment  dose  and  individual-level  predictions  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters.  Exposure  data 
were merged with the PK/TEAEs analysis dataset. The PK/safety analysis for TEAEs included 403 subjects 
with EC from Study KN775/309. The subject quartiles of lenvatinib AUC (Q1 - Q4 group) are presented in 
the table below:

is  presented  below,  from  Figure  7  to  Figure  11,  respectively.  Left  figure  panels  display  the  observed 
proportion  of  TEAE  CTC  grades  across  four  quartiles  of  lenvatinib  AUC  (stacked  barplots).  Right  panels

There  was  a  weak,  generally  positive  relationship  of  TEAEs  and  lenvatinib  AUC,  for  all  TEAE  categories 
except for hypothyroidism, where the relationship was essentially flat over the AUC range. The 95% CIs for 
the exposure logit parameter included 0 across all TEAE categories. For hypertension, proteinuria, weight 
decreased  and  vomiting,  probability  of  any  AE  (GRADE  >0  )  increased  on  average  up  to  7%  across  the 
range of Q1-Q4 exposures corresponding to 12.5%-87.5% of the distribution, as represented in Table 14.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction 
with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been 
shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell responses, 
including  anti-tumour  responses,  through  blockade  of  PD-1  binding  to  PD-L1  and  PD-L2,  which  are 
expressed  in  antigen  presenting  cells  and  may  be  expressed  by  tumours  or  other  cells  in  the  tumour 
microenvironment. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Data from Arm A of the study were used to explore the relationship between exposure to lenvatinib and 
safety events related to lenvatinib (Population Analysis CPMS-E7080-015P-v1), see section above. 
No  new  information  regarding  PK/PD  modelling  for  pembrolizumab  is  available  within  this  extension  of 
indication. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical  pharmacology  results  for  the  combination  therapy  of  Pembrolizumab  together  with  Lenvatinib, 
specific  to  support  approval  for  second  line  treatment  of  advanced  endometrial  carcinoma  (EC),  are 
available from the Phase 3 Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. 
Analytical methods  
The lenvatinib method validation (Project n. 187184AUWZ) as well as the bioanalytical report (MK-3475-
775) were submitted. 
The method for the determination of lenvatinib (MK-7902) was proven to be precise, accurate, sensitive 
and selective over the validated range from 0.25 to 250 ng/mL. Dilution integrity has been demonstrated 
using QC samples at 2500 ng/mL, diluted 20 folds and showed that it does not affect precision and accuracy. 
The  method  is  reliable  and  reproducible  and  the  analyte  and  the  internal  standard  are  stable  under  all 
conditions tested. Long-Term stability of lenvatinib in matrix (human sodium heparinized plasma) has been 
evaluated and demonstrated for a period of 6, 153, 343 and 675 days at -20ºC and -80°C, whereas the 
maximum sample storage duration from collection to analysis of study samples was 927 days at -20ºC.  
The  long-Term  stability  validation  of  lenvatinib  in  matrix  (human  sodium  heparinized  plasma)  has  been 
evaluated and demonstrated for a period up to 675 days at -20°C and -80°C. 
Calibration  standard  and  QC  acceptance  criteria  for  each  analytical  run  were  set  according  to  the  EMA 
“Guideline on bioanalytical method validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). Intra-
run and between-run precision and accuracy were suitably demonstrated. Linearity of calibration curve was 
set applying a weighted (1/x2) linear least-squares regression of the peak area ratios (analyte to internal 
standard)  of  the  calibration  standards.  The  selectivity  of  the  assay  was  confirmed  by  processing  control 
(analyte-free) human sodium heparinized plasma samples in each run to demonstrate that no interfering

compounds elute at the same retention times than that of the analyte and internal standard. Interfering 
medications  investigated,  at  therapeutic  concentrations,  were:  acetaminophen,  acetylsalicylic  acid, 
caffeine,  cotinine,  dimenhydrinate,  dextromethorphan,  diphenhydramine,  ethinyl  estradiol,  ibuprofen, 
levonorgestrel,  nicotine,  pseudoephedrine,  and  salicylic  acid.  The  results  met  the  pre-established 
acceptance criteria. 
The  MAH  stated  that  during  assay  development  and  validation,  multiple  LC  MS/MS  systems  (LC  MS  MS 
4000  01,  LC  MS  MS  4000  13  and  LC  MS  MS  4000  17)  were  used  and  found  to  be  equivalent.  System 
performances  such  as  calibration  curves,  Y  intercept  and  slope  were  found  to  be  comparable  across 
systems, therefore no cross or partial validation has been considered necessary across systems.  
A  total  of  461  re-assayed  analyses  (18.80%)  corresponding  to  425  re-analyzed  study  samples  were 
performed. Main reason for re-analysis (18.07% of the total) was concentrations measured above the upper 
limit of quantitation of the calibration curve. A total of 173 study samples were successfully analyzed for 
the  incurred  sample  reproducibility  analysis  fulfilling  the  acceptance  criteria  as  set  by  relevant  EMA 
guideline. 
Pharmacokinetic data  
The clinical pharmacology package for this Application includes an updated lenvatinib population PK analysis 
including data from updated lenvatinib population PK information from participants treated with lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. 
Plasma concentrations of Pembrolizumab and ADA were not collected in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. 
Pembrolizumab PK and ADA data were not collected in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775, and so no new information 
is  provided  for  pembrolizumab  in  alignment  with  the  agreement  reached  with  the  Rapporteurs  in  2017. 
Although  it  is  understood  that  the  potential  of  DDI  between  biologics  and  small  molecules,  such  as 
lenvatinib,  is  negligible,  considering  divergent  metabolic  pathways  for  both  compounds  sparse  samples 
should have been collected for pembrolizumab to check if the observed concentrations in EC patients treated 
with pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib fall within the range of predicted concentrations (using 
the reference model), both after first dose and at steady state.  
It  was  also  clarified  that  PK  data  of  pembrolizumab  have  been  collected  in  a  number  of  other  studies 
investigating the same combination therapy (pembrolizumab and lenvatinib) in another indication where 
PK results confirmed no impact to the exposures of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in presence of each other 
in the combination setting. 
Although this was understood, the dossier of this procedure lacked a clear reference to tables and figures 
that demonstrate this consistency in exposures. 
An updated lenvatinib population PK analysis was provided that describes objectives, methods and results 
of the population PK analysis of lenvatinib using data pooled across several studies, including Study KN-
775/309. This report also includes PK/safety analyses (Study KN-775/309/Arm A) in subjects with EC. 
The updated Population PK analysis was performed using data from Study KN775/309 in subjects with EC 
pooled with data from Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and Phase 1, 2 and/or 3 studies in subjects 
with other solid tumors, for a total of 22 studies. Exposure-response analysis for adverse events related to 
lenvatinib only was performed using data from Study 309/Arm A in subjects with EC.  
The  PK  of  lenvatinib  was  described  by  a  3-compartment  model  with  elimination  from  the  central 
compartment  and  simultaneous  first  and  zero  order  absorption.  The  model  was  parameterized  for  CL/F, 
V1/F, Q2/F, V2/F, Q3/F, V3/F, Ka, D1 and F1.  
The final pooled lenvatinib PK dataset included 25738 observations from a total of 3025 subjects. For EC 
subjects, there were 2178 lenvatinib concentrations available from 403 subjects from Study KN775/309.

A lot of Lenvatinib Observations were excluded from PK Dataset as “outlier, inconsistent with PK profile”. 
In total 79 PK observations of 2408 (3.3% of total) from Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 were excluded from the 
PK analyses. Most of the excluded PK observations were inconsistent with the PK profile of lenvatinib with 
the majority of those with TAD >60 hours having concentrations close to the limit of quantification of 0.25 
ng/mL.  These  excluded  observations  were  causing  numerical  difficulties  during  estimation  resulting  in 
model  termination  or  termination  with  errors.  When  these  observations  were  excluded  the  PK  model 
terminated successfully. 
Regarding  excluded  BLQ  observations  from  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775,  97  observations  (1.4%  of  total 
observations)  were  associated  with  TAD  ≤200  hours,  and  the  majority  (>79%)  of  those  were  TAD  ≤1 
hour.  
Linear  and  semi-log  plots  of  dose-normalized  lenvatinib  plasma  concentration  versus  time  after  dose  at 
steady  state  in  EC  patients,  showed  that  median  lenvatinib  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  were 
comparable when lenvatinib was administered alone and with pembrolizumab. As already stated no data 
are available for pembrolizumab plasma concentration in combination with lenvatinib. 
The  full  covariate  model  included  body  weight  as  an  allometric  constant  on  clearances  and  volume 
parameters,  albumin  <  30  g/L  and  ALP  >  ULN  on  CL/F,  and  concomitant  CYP3A4  inhibitors  on  CL/F. 
Lenvatinib CL/F differences for EC, DTC, RCC, HCC and healthy subjects, as well as sex and concomitant 
pembrolizumab were also included in the full covariate model. 
All the parameters of the final model seem to be well estimated with a %RSE ≤ 3.76%. 
The  EC  population  was  estimated  with  a  24.9%  lower  lenvatinib  CL/F  compared  with  other  solid  tumor 
types excluding DTC, RCC and HCC. Moreover, Lenvatinib CL/F was found to be 7% higher with concomitant 
pembrolizumab. Individual Derived Pharmacokinetic Parameters, CL/F and AUC, for EC subjects receiving 
lenvatinib 20 mg in combination with pembrolizumab in Study KN775/309 were compared with CL/F and 
AUC dose-normalized to 20 mg in subjects with RCC and other tumor types received lenvatinib monotherapy 
or with concomitant everolimus in the pooled PK dataset.  
The CL of lenvatinib in EC patients is lower and hence the AUC higher than both the values of lenvatinib in 
monotherapy and the values of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus in RCC. 
However, the CL of lenvatinib in EC patients would appear not to be due to the effect of the combination 
with  pembrolizumab,  as  lenvatinib  CL  is  equal  in  both  the  presence  (yes)  and  absence  (no)  of 
pembrolizumab,  indicating  that  there  is  no  effect  of  pembrolizumab  co-administration  on  lenvatinib.  No 
hypothesis  on  the  cause  of  the  observed  difference  in  CL  in  EC  patients,  with  the  argument  that  the 
magnitude of this effect in EC patients (24.9%) is within the inter-subject variability for CL (33.5%) and 
hence of no apparent clinical relevance.  
Goodness-of-fit-plots for the final PK model for lenvatinib based on the pooled dataset were presented, the 
scatter  plots  of  CWRES  vs.  population  predicted  concentrations  and  vs.  time  showed  the  CWRES  to  be 
distributed around zero. 
Plots  of  ETA  (CL/F)  vs  covariates  (tumor  type  and  concomitant  pembrolizumab)  seems  to  be  normally 
distributed with a mean of 0. 
The  Final  PK  model  was  also  evaluated  using  pcVPC.  The  prediction  corrected  VPCs  which  includes  and 
excludes Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 were provioded. Plots indicates good predictive performance of the final 
PK model for the lenvatinib concentration time course in the overall population considered in the final model 
(popPK analysis of lenvatinib from all studies) both including and excluding Study 309/KEYNOTE-775.  
Lenvatinib  population  PK  model  was  used  to  derive  individual  PK  parameters  and  resulting  lenvatinib 
exposure (AUC) in subjects from Study KN775/309, and exposure data were merged with the PK/TEAEs 
analysis dataset. 
There  was  a  weak,  generally  positive  relationship  of  TEAEs  and  lenvatinib  AUC,  for  all  TEAE  categories 
(hypertension, proteinuria weight decrease and vomiting) except for hypothyroidism, where the relationship 
was essentially flat over the AUC range.

Pembrolizumab Dose: The MAH stated that as the dosage of 400 mg Q6W has been approved for all adult 
indications for monotherapy and combination indications in the US and the EU, the 400 mg Q6W dosing 
regimen would have a similar benefit-risk profile as the 200 mg Q3W (or 2 mg/kg Q3W) dosing regimen in 
the clinical use of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in adults with advanced EC.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The  lenvatinib  dose  of  20  mg  QD  used  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  in  treating 
advanced  EC  was  established  in  a  Phase  1b/2  Study  E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146.  Since  then,  this 
dosage has been implemented across the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab clinical programme. 
KEYNOTE-146:  A  Multicenter,  Open-Label  Phase  1b/2  Trial  of  Lenvatinib  (E7080)  Plus 
Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Selected Solid Tumors 
E7080-A001-111/KEYNOTE-146  is  an  ongoing,  multicenter,  open-label,  Phase  1b/2  study  of  the 
combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  in  subjects  with  1  of  the  following  confirmed  metastatic 
tumor types: EC, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck (HNSCC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), or melanoma.  
The study was conducted in 2 phases, Phase 1b and Phase 2.  
- In Phase 1b (dose finding), the primary objective was to determine and confirm the maximum tolerated 
dose  (MTD)  for  lenvatinib once  daily  (QD)  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  in  subjects 
with selected solid tumors.  
The MTD was investigated using a dose de˗escalation strategy with a 3 + 3 design.  
The lenvatinib doses selected were 24, 20, and 14 mg QD all in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg 
Q3W given IV. Lenvatinib 24 mg was selected as the starting dose based on the recommended dose for 
lenvatinib monotherapy in locally differentiated thyroid cancer (see Lenvima SmPC). Lenvatinib 20 mg and 
14  mg  were  the  first  and  second  doses  in  lenvatinib’s  dose  reduction  scheme  for  all  tumors  (except 
hepatocellular carcinoma) for which data were available. 
For  determination  of  the  MTD,  only  dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  during  the  first  21  days  (Cycle  1)  of 
treatment  were  assessed.  Once  the  MTD  was  determined,  the  recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  for 
lenvatinib to be used in combination with pembrolizumab was chosen and enrollment in Phase 2 began, 
where RP2D was used.  
A total of 13 subjects were enrolled in phase 1b. The first 3 subjects, including 2 subjects with RCC and 1 
with  NSCLC,  received  lenvatinib  at  24  mg  QD  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  (Dose

Level 1). Two of the 3 subjects experienced a DLT during the first cycle of treatment (Grade 3 arthralgia 
and  Grade  3  fatigue,  respectively).  In  both  cases,  the  dose  of  lenvatinib  was  reduced  and  the  subjects 
continued  to  receive  study  treatment.  Subsequently,  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  20  mg  plus 
pembrolizumab 200 mg (Dose Level 2) was investigated in 3 subjects, including 2 subjects with EC.  No 
DLTs were observed and the cohort was expanded to a total of 10 subjects to confirm the MTD. No other 
DLTs were observed, and the MTD was determined to be lenvatinib 20 mg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg, 
which was the RP2D for the Phase 2 Extension.  
-  In  Phase  2  (extension),  subjects  were  assigned  by  tumor  type  to  1  of  6  cohorts  (EC,  RCC,  NSCLC, 
HNSCC, UC, or melanoma) and received the RP2D of lenvatinib 20 mg QD orally plus pembrolizumab 200 
mg IV Q3W. Primary objective was to evaluate ORR as of Week 24 in each of the cohorts, using immune-
related  (ir)  RECIST  per  investigator  assessment.  A  total  of  273  subjects  were  enrolled  in  Phase  2  and 
received the RP2D of the combination.

Sample size 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary endpoints PFS and OS.  
A total of 780 participants (660 pMMR and 120 dMMR) were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (330 pMMR 
and 60 dMMR in each treatment arm). 
The  study  was  considered  to  have  completed  enrollment  when  660  pMMR  participants  have  enrolled. 
Enrollment of dMMR participants will be capped at 120. 
Sample  size  and power  calculations  based  on pMMR  participants: the  study  had  90%  power  to  detect  a 
statistically significant difference in OS at one-sided α=0.0245 and as a result, at least 99% power to detect 
a statistical significant difference in PFS at one-sided α=0.0005. 
Assuming an accrual period of 19 months and a follow-up period of 24 months, a total of 660 participants 
are required to observe 526 death events 43 months after the first participant is randomized (19 months 
enrollment plus 24 months follow-up period), required to detect a statistically significant difference in OS 
at 0.0245 level with 90% power, under the following assumptions that: 1) HR 0.75 (median OS is 16.4 
months in Arm A and 12.3 months in Arm B), 2) the first interim analysis is performed when 368 OS events 
are observed (i.e. 70% of the total target death events), 3) the second interim analysis is performed when 
approximately 463 OS events are observed (i.e. 88% of the total target death events), and 4) Lan-DeMets 
spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary is used. 
The final PFS analysis is planned at the time of the first OS interim analysis (IA1) at 27 months after the 
first  participant  is  randomized.  A  total  of  564  PFS  events  are  estimated  to  be  observed  to  detect  a 
statistically significant difference at alpha 0.0005 level with >99% power under the assumption that the 
hazard ratio is 0.55 (median PFS is 7.3 months in Arm A and 4 months in Arm B). 
Power  calculations  based  on  pMMR  and  dMMR  participants  combined  (all  comer):  Assuming  an  accrual 
period of 19 months and a follow-up period of 24 months, a total of 780 participants are required in the all 
comer  population  to  observe  618  death  events  by  the  time  of  43  months  after  the  first  participant  is 
randomized  (19  months  enrollment  plus  24  months  follow-up  period),  required  to  detect  a  statistically 
significant difference in OS at 0.02205 level with 93.5% power, under the following assumptions: 1) HR 
0.75  (median  OS  is  16.4  months  in  Arm  A  and  12.3  months  in  Arm  B),  2)  the  first  interim  analysis  is 
performed when approximately 433 OS events are observed (i.e. 70% of the total target death events), 3) 
Assessment report

the second interim analysis is performed when approximately 544 OS events are observed (i.e. 88% of the 
total target death events), and 4) Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary is used. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  or  to  TPC 
(doxorubicin  or  paclitaxel).  Treatment  allocation/randomization  will  occur  centrally  using  an  interactive 
response technology (IRT) system, based on the following stratification factors:  
- MMR status (pMMR or dMMR) 
- ECOG performance status (0 or 1) 
- geographic region (Region 1: Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel or Region 2: rest 
of the world) 
- prior history of pelvic radiation (yes or no).  
First, participants were stratified according to MMR status. Then, only within the pMMR stratum, participants 
were further stratified according to ECOG performance status, geographic region, and prior history of pelvic 
radiation. A total of 9 strata were utilized for the study.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
All  images  obtained  were  submitted  to  a  blinded  independent  central  review  (BICR)  to  assess  objective 
response and progression-free survival.  
Statistical methods 
Populations for efficacy analysis: The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population served as the population for 
the primary efficacy analyses, which included all randomized participants, analyzed in the treatment group 
to which they were randomized.  
The HRQoL analyses are based on the HRQoL full analysis set (FAS) population, defined as participants who 
have received treatment and have at least one HRQoL assessment available. 
Statistical  methods:  Analyses  were  performed  in  two  subsets  of  subjects:  All-comer  participants  and 
pMMR participants.  
For the primary analysis of PFS and OS, the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 
the PFS curve in each treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS was assessed by the stratified log-
rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling was used to assess 
the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  difference  (ie,  the  HR)  between  the  treatment  arms.  The  stratification 
factors used for randomization (MMR status, ECOG, geographic region, and prior history of pelvic radiation) 
were applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. 
For ORR,  stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method was used for comparison of the ORR between two 
treatment groups. The stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. The point 
estimate of ORR and 95% CI using exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson (1934) were 
to be provided.

Interim analyses: efficacy interim analyses (IA) were conducted by the external DMC. Two OS IA  and 
one OS final analysis (FA) were planned. The PFS FA was performed at the time of first IA for OS. Since 
the timing of the first interim analysis is driven by the required number of OS event, the observed number 
of PFS events may be different from the expected counts. The Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien-
Fleming boundary were used for alpha allocation among IA and FA for OS.

Multiplicity: The total family-wise error rate (Type-I error) among the dual-primary PFS and OS and the 
secondary  ORR  endpoints  was  strongly  controlled  at  one-sided  0.025  level.  The  multiplicity  strategy 
followed the graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz.

Participants  were  enrolled  from  11-JUN-2018  to  03-FEB-2020  across  167  global  sites  in  21  countries 
worldwide.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were classified as per the ICH E3 classification of protocol deviations as important (those 
that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key study data or that may significantly affect a 
participant’s rights, safety, or well-being) or not important. Important protocol deviations were reported 
for 51 participants in this study, 27 (6.6%) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 24 (5.8%) in the TPC 
groups  respectively.  Of  the  important  protocol  deviations,  20  participants  had  deviations  that  were 
considered to be clinically important (deviations that may compromise critical data analyses pertaining to 
primary  efficacy  and/or  safety  endpoints  or  the  participant’s  safety)  (2.4%),  11  vs  9  subjects  in  the 
combination vs control arm, respectively.

Medical History and Concurrent Illnesses: In all-comer participants, the 2 treatment groups were generally 
comparable for medical history conditions and concurrent illnesses. More than 50% of participants reported 
prior medical history of gastrointestinal disorders or vascular disorders. Approximately 13% of participants 
had hypothyroidism in each group. About 10% had hepatobiliary disorders including 4.0% with cholelithiasis 
(similar  incidence  in  both  groups)  and  4.3%  with  hepatic  steatosis  (6.7%  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group and 1.8% in the TPC group). About 50% of participants had metabolism and nutrition 
disorders  including  diabetes  mellitus  (9.3%),  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (9.1%),  hypercholesterolemia 
(10.1%) and obesity (5.5%). More than half of the patients had vascular disorders including 44.7% with 
hypertension in both arms.  
Numbers analysed 
A total of 827 patients were included in the ITT population (411 in the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib arm vs 
416 in the chemotherapy arm). Of those, 697 (84.3%) were pMMR (346 in the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
arm vs 351 in the chemotherapy arm).

Primary Endpoints 
•  Progression-Free Survival 
At the IA1 (corresponding to final analysis for PFS), the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 
statistical  significantly  superior  to  TPC  with  respect  to  PFS  in  both  pMMR  participants  and  all-comer 
participants.

•  Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-30) 
Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed for both pMMR and all-comers population using the 
PRO instruments EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-EN24, and EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L.  
Baseline GHS/QoL scores were similar between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and TPC group. 
The GHS/QoL scores decreased similarly in both treatment groups.

Baseline PRO scores were generally similar between lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and TPC group 
as measured by EORTC QLQ-30 physical functioning score, EORTC QLQ-EN24 urological symptoms score, 
and EQ-5D-5L VAS score. 
EORTC  QLQ-30  physical  functioning  scores  and  EQ-5D-5L  VAS  scores  decreased  slightly  in  both  the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  and  TPC  group  and  were  generally  similar  between  the  2  groups 
during the evaluation period, while EORTC QLQ-EN24 urological symptoms scores were maintained over 
time in both groups.

•  Patients with prior systemic therapy in neo-adjuvant/adjuvant setting only  
Approximately 35% of subjects in both arms received study treatment as first line for advanced/metastatic 
setting,  i.e.  after  relapse  to  platinum-based  chemotherapy  received  as  (neo)adjuvant  therapy.  In  those 
subjects, the median platinum-free interval was generally similar between the 2 treatment groups (median 
PFI 6.2 vs 5.6 months).

Phase 1b/2 Single arm Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 
Study 111/KEYNOTE-146 is a multicenter, open-label phase 1b/2 trial of Lenvatinib plus Pembrolizumab in 
subjects with selected solid tumors. In this study, among the 283 treated subjects in the phase 2 portion 
who receive the RP2D, 124 subjects had EC (All EC Set); and 108 of these subjects (the EC 2L+ Set) had 
EC that was previously treated with 1 systemic anticancer therapy and met the pre-specified criteria for 
follow-up for the efficacy analysis. The data cutoff of 10 Jan 2019 was established based on the date when 
at least 100 subjects with histologically confirmed EC that was previously treated with at least 1 systemic 
anticancer therapy would have sufficient follow-up to provide a median follow-up of at least 12 months, 
and  for  all  responders,  an  opportunity  for  follow-up  after  initial  objective  response  as  assessed  by  the 
investigator  of  at  least  6  months.  At  the  time  of  data  cutoff,  the  median  follow-up  for  the  EC  2L+  Set 
(n=108) was 18.7 months.  
Baseline characteristics: in the EC 2L+ Set (n=108), the majority of subjects were white (86.1%) and from 
the US (86.1%). Median age was 66.0 years. In the EC 2L+ Set, the ECOG score was 0 in 49.1% of subjects 
and 1 in 50.9% of subjects. In the EC 2L+ Set, all enrolled subjects had metastatic disease, and median 
time since original diagnosis was 22.7 months. The most common histologic EC subtypes were endometrioid

adenocarcinoma (50.9%) and serous adenocarcinoma (32.4%). The majority of subjects (70.4%) had FIGO 
Grade 3 tumors at original diagnosis. In the EC 2L+ Set, 94 subjects had Non-MSI-H/pMMR tumors, 11 
subjects had MSI˗H/dMMR tumors, and for 3 subjects, MSI/MMR status was not available (MSI status was 
determined centrally, initially by PCR then by IHC). Tumors were PD˗L1 positive for 53 (49.1%) subjects, 
and PD˗L1 negative for 43 (39.8%) subjects, while PD-L1 status was not available for 12 (11.1%) subjects. 
All subjects in the EC 2L+ Set received at least one prior systemic anticancer treatment, and all received 
prior  platinum-based  chemotherapy;  52.8%  of  subjects  received  1  prior  regimen,  37.0%  of  subjects 
received 2 prior regimens, and 10.2% subjects received ≥3 prior regimens.

a  The dMMR/MSI-H analysis with a data cutoff of 05-OCT-2020 included pooling of participants from Cohorts D and 
K (n=90), and for efficacy analysis, only participants with ≥6 months of follow-up were included (n=79). 
At the time of the data cut-off of each supportive study, 25 of the 133 participants (18.8%) with EC treated 
with  lenvatinib  monotherapy  had  treatment  ongoing  in  Study  204,  while  all  patients  had  completed  or 
discontinued pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-158 Cohort D and in KEYNOTE-028. Of the total 90 
MSI-H  patients  in  KEYNOTE-158  (n=11  in  cohort  D  and  n=79  in  cohort  K),  20  patient  (22.2%)  had 
treatment with pembrolizumab ongoing at the cut-off date.   
Number of patients analysed:  
In KEYNOTE-158 study, a total of 90 patients with MSI-H (n=11 in cohort D and n=79 in cohort K) were 
enrolled  up  to  23-Sep-2020.  The  population  for  efficacy  analysis  is  however  provided  for  a  total  of  79 
patients (i.e. n=11 in cohort D and n=68 in cohort K) including only participants with at least 6 months of 
follow up. It is understood that the 11 subjects in cohort K excluded from the efficacy analysis with less 
than 6 months of follow up were all treatment still on treatment at the data cut-off date.   
Comparison of inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
The  3  studies  presented  as  supportive  are  single  arm  trials.  All  enrolled  a  population  with 
advanced/metastatic endometrial carcinoma who have received prior treatment. KEYNOTE-158 and -028 
allowed  the  enrolment  of  more  pretreated  patients  compared  to  KEYNOTE-775  and  Study  204  which 
mandate radiological disease progression to platinum-based treatment.  
Endometrial sarcomas were excluded from all studies with the exceptions of KEYNOTE-028, however in this 
study only one patient had a carcinosarcoma (see baseline characteristics below). All studies included only 
patients with measurable disease.

Compared  to  the  pivotal  study  KEYNOTE-775  and  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  supportive  studies 
KEYNOTE-158 and 028, Study 204 allowed the enrolment of patients with ECOG 2. Of note, KEYNOTE-028 
enrolled only patients with PD-L1 positive disease.  
Comparison of dose regimens:  
The dose of lenvatinib used in the supportive Study-204 (24 mg OD) was higher than the one used as part 
of the combination treatment with pembrolizumab (20 mg OD). No data are available for lenvatinib 20 mg 
OD as monotherapy. On the contrary, the dose of pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-158 was the 
same as in the pivotal trial KEYNOTE-775. The dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W was instead used in KEYNOTE-028.  
Overall response rate: 
Patients  in  all  trials  had  measurable  disease  by  RECIST  1.1,  and  the  primary  evaluation  of  ORR  was 
conducted by BICR per RECIST 1.1 in KEYNOTE-775, KEYNOTE-158 and  Study-204. On the contrary, in 
KEYNOTE-028 the primary response evaluation was conducted by investigator. However, BICR revision was 
performed for regulatory purposes also in this study and results has been presented by the MAH. This is 
welcomed for the cross-study comparison.     
Radiology assessment was performed every 8 weeks in KEYNOTE-775 and Study-204, but every 9 weeks 
in KEYNOTE-158.

A comparison of baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in KEYNOTE-775 and in the supportive studies 
has been presented. While in KEYNOTE-775 and KEYNOTE-158 study the MMR status of patients is available, 
this is unknown in KEYNOTE-028 and in Study-204.  
The main differences noted in baseline characteristics noted are:  
1) patients in KEYNOTE-775 have better performance status compared to patients enrolled in the supportive 
studies;  
Assessment report  
EMA/617606/2021 
Page 98/170 
 
 
 
 
 
2) patients in the pembrolizumab monotherapy studies KEYNOTE-158 and -028 were more pretreated;  
3) slightly lower median age in Study-204;  
4) few more Asian patients in KEYNOTE-755. 
It cannot be excluded that point 1) and 2) above could have possibly ameliorate the outcome of KEYNOTE-
775  population  with  respect  to  subjects  receiving  monotherapy  in  the  supportive  studies,  while  the 
relevance of the other two aspects could possibly be marginal.   
PD-L1  status  was  not  collected  in  KEYNOTE-775  nor  in  Study-204.  While  this  is  comprehensible  for  the 
lenvatinib  Study-204,  this  is  not  understood  for  KEYNOTE-775.  Data  on  PD-L1  status  are  limited  in 
KEYNOTE-158 (not available in 70% of patients with dMMR status) while in KEYNOTE-028 all subjects were 
PD-L1 positive per inclusion criteria. This is considered a limit for data interpretation for the time being.  
No relevant differences are seen in histology (endometrioid vs non endometrioid) among studies based on 
additional data provided (not shown). In the dMMR population of KEYNOTE-775 study, most of the subject 
has endometrioid histology, which is in line with the characteristics of dMMR EC.

were observed and this was considered the RP2D. Pembrolizumab was used only at its recommended dose 
of  200  mg  /Q3W.  As  a  result,  almost  all  patients  in  clinical  trials  received  the  20  mg  lenvatinib  OD  + 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W dose. However, in KEYNOTE-775 approximately two/third of subjects had to 
reduce the dose of lenvatinib due to side effect. 
From the efficacy perspective, in this supportive study Study 111/KEYNOTE-146, a total of 108 patients 
with endometrial cancer in 2L+ received the combination, of whom the majority had pMMR tumor and only 
11 were dMMR. Overall, the ORR results are supportive of the activity of the combination observed in the 
pivotal  study  KEYNOTE-775.  In  particular,  higher  ORR  is  observed in  dMMR  compared to  pMMR  tumors, 
although the limited number of dMMR subjects preclude definitive conclusion.  
Pivotal study 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 is a multicenter, open-label, randomized 1:1, Phase 3 trial to compare the efficacy 
and safety of Lenvatinib in combination with Pembrolizumab vs treatment of physician’s choice (paclitaxel 
or doxorubicin) in participants with measurable advanced endometrial cancer (EC). Patients should have 
progressed to 1 prior platinum-based therapy (if given in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting, one rechallenge 
with platinum was permitted). Prior hormonal therapy was allowed with no restriction. Approximately 37% 
of patients in both arms received the treatment study as 1L for advanced/metastatic disease.  
As all enrolled subjects (except one in the investigational arm, which was an important protocol deviation) 
received prior platinum-based therapy (77.5% one line and 22.2% two lines), and taking into account that 
platinum-based treatment is considered the standard first-line in EC15 16, the wording of the indication was 
amended to specify the use of a prior platinum-containing therapy. 
Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are regarded valid second-line treatment options after platinum-based treatment 
of endometrial cancer. Approximately three-quarters of subjects in the control arm received doxorubicin, 
while  less  than  30%  received  paclitaxel.  Of  the  latter,  approximately  80%  received  also  paclitaxel  as 
previous  treatment.  For  patients  in  the  control  arm  receiving  paclitaxel,  outcome  is  similar  regardless 
whether they have received paclitaxel previously. This is reassuring, although, as there are few patients 
who  were  not  rechallenged  with  paclitaxel,  no  definitive  conclusion  can  be  made.  The  performance  of 
patients treated with doxorubicin in the control arm appear unexpectedly inferior to patients who received 
paclitaxel. It is acknowledged however that patients who received paclitaxel are limited, and it is difficult 
to  draw  definitive  conclusion.  When  analyzed  by  chemotherapy  chosen  prior  to  randomization  for  all 
randomized participant, an advantage of the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib combination is maintained vs each 
chemotherapy drug. 
Inclusion/exclusion  criteria  reflect  the  usual  criteria  used  for  immunotherapy  trials,  which  are  already 
reflected in the pembrolizumab SmPC. In addition, there were several quite strict exclusion criteria related 
to  hypertension,  proteinuria,  history  of  CV  disease,  previous  bleeding,  fistula,  which  is  considered 
acceptable  given  the  known  toxicity  of  lenvatinib, and  have  been  added  to  the  SmPC  section  5.1  in  the 
description of study population.  
In addition, as only patients with ECOG 0-1 were allowed, a significant number of real-world endometrial 
cancer patients being treated in second-line setting would have been excluded (as also underlined at the

time  of  the  Scientific  Advice,  where  it  was  suggested  to  consider  inclusion  of  ECOG  PS  2  patients).  Not 
qualifying ECOG, together with inadequate organ function or condition that may confound the results, were 
indeed  the  most  common  reasons  for  screen  failure,  suggesting  that  the  target  population  of  advanced 
endometrial  cancer  in  the  post  platinum  setting  include  a  not  negligible  amount  of  frail  subjects  with 
comorbidities. Therefore, the population included in this study possibly reflect a fitter subgroup of subjects 
with  advanced  endometrial  carcinoma  and  might  not  be  fully  representative  of  an  endometrial  cancer 
population  in  late  line  with  generally  dismal  prognosis.  The  enrolment  of  only  ECOG  0-1  patients  is 
mentioned in the SmPC.  
Apart from that, baseline disease characteristics were overall reflective of a population with advanced EC. 
Few more pretreated patients were however included in the control arm. 
The open-label design is not optimal, though understood in the context of the differences of treatment in 
the two arms and different toxicities. The blinded review of images to determine ORR and PFS is endorsed. 
Not unexpectedly in an open-label trial, more patients in the control rather than in the investigational arm 
did  not  receive  the  treatment  they  were  randomized  to,  as  well  as  there  were  more  patients  who 
discontinued therapy due to subject or physician’s decision. 
The study has PFS and OS in the all-comer and in the pMMR population as dual primary endpoints. ORR in 
both populations was key secondary endpoint. This is acceptable. At the time of the SA, indeed, the CHMP 
questioned that “PFS does not seem acceptable as a primary endpoint. Approval based on PFS without fully 
powered OS superiority would be improbable in advanced endometrial carcinoma after at least one prior 
platinum-based treatment.” Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 study is powered also for OS, which is in line with 
prior advice.  Statistical methods appear standard. Assumptions for median PFS and OS in the control arm 
were in line with literature data17 18. 
Patients  were  stratified  according  to  MMR  status,  ECOG,  geographic  region  and  prior  history  of  pelvic 
radiation,  which  is  acceptable.  MMR  status  was  assessed  centrally  with  IHC,  using  a  clinical  trial  assay 
testing all four MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2), as usually recommended. The enrolment of 
dMMR patients was capped at 15%, which is in line with the expected prevalence of in line with prevalence 
of MSI-H EC reported in literature19 20.  
Number of important protocol deviation was low and similar in both arms, which is reassuring on the study 
conduction.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results of the Interim Analysis 1 (i.e. final for PFS, interim for OS) with data cut-off date 26 Oct 2020 were 
submitted. The median duration of follow up in the overall population of 11.4 months (range 0.3, 26.9).  
Baseline patients and disease characteristics were overall well balanced between the two treatment arms 
in the ITT population (411 vs 416 patients) as well as in the pMMR population (346 vs 351, comprising 85% 
of the all comers). The characteristics of pMMR subpopulation were similar to all comers. PD-L1 expression, 
as well as POLE mutations, was not assessed by the MAH.

Not  unexpectedly  in  an  open-label  trial,  there  are  more  patients  in  the  control  rather  than  in  the 
investigational arm who did not receive the treatment they were randomized to, and who discontinued due 
to  subject’s  or  physician’s  decision.  Most  common  reason  for discontinuation  in  both  arms  was  PD,  with 
more clinical progression among patients treated with chemotherapy. A higher rate of discontinuations due 
to adverse event was observed in the combination arm.  
All-comer population  
The  combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
meaningful superiority to TPC with respect to PFS and OS in all-comers.  
Death event occurred in almost half of the subjects overall, but about 10% more events were reported in 
the control arm (46% vs 59%). HR for OS was 0.62 (95%CI 0.51, 0.75, p<0.0001 one-sided), with a gain 
of about 7 months in median survival (18.3 vs 11.4 months). OS curves overlap up to month 3 and remained 
consistently separated throughout the duration of the evaluation period, although difficult to be interpreted 
after month 9 due to high rate of censoring. As OS data is not fully mature yet, the MAH will submit final 
OS  data  for  the  overall  population  as  well  as  for  MMR  subgroups  as  recommendation  (REC)  which  is 
expected in 4Q2022. 
Although similar PFS event rates occurred in both arms (ca 68%), a clinically relevant advantage is seen 
in PFS [HR of 0.56 (95%CI 0.47, 0.66, p>0.0001 one-sided)] with almost doubled median PFS (7.2 vs 3.8 
months in the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib vs TPC arm, respectively) and maintained benefit long-term as 
seen in consistent separation of KM curves. PFS sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary one. 
PFS2 data is considered further supportive (HR 0.56). PFS assessed by BICR and investigator was similar. 
The rate of agreement between INV and BICR was approximately 80-85%, with no relevant differences in 
agreement/disagreement rates noted between the two arms. 
ORR  was  almost  doubled  in  patients  receiving  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  compared  to  standard 
chemotherapy  (31.9%  vs  14.7%),  with  higher  rate  of  CR  (6.6%  vs  2.6%).  Although  the  ORR  of  the 
combination  does  not  appear  particularly  outstanding,  the  improvement  compared  to  standard 
chemotherapy is relevant. The higher rate of patients with missing assessment in the control arm compared 
to the experimental arm (roughly 13% vs 5%) was due to consent withdrawn after being assigned or having 
started treatment in the control arm, which is somewhat related to the open-label study design, despite 
the MAH’s intervention to monitor and mitigate discontinuations.  
As  expected,  the  median  DOR  was  longer  in  the  experimental  arm  (14.4  vs  5.7  months),  with  higher 
number of durable responses (71.9% vs 42.6% of responding subjects for ≥6 months).   
The percentage of patients who receive at least one subsequent line of treatment was higher in the control 
arm  compared  to  the  investigational  arm  (28%  vs  48.1%),  despite  a  similar  rate  of  subjects  who 
discontinued study treatment in both arms, as well as similar rate of subjects experiencing a PFS event of 
disease progression. This raises concern on the ability to receive additional line(s) of treatment, in particular 
in subjects who discontinued therapy due to AEs. Additional data showed that among patients discontinuing 
due  to  AE,  subsequent  therapies  were  administered  less  frequently  after  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab 
compared to patients in the control arm (23.3% vs 39.4%). Such difference is not evident in subjects who 
had progressive disease, as about half in each treatment arm received subsequent anticancer therapy. The 
MAH  discussed  that  there  is  insufficient  data  to  determine  why  participants  did  not  start  subsequent 
systemic  anticancer  therapy  following  discontinuation  of  study  treatment  due  to  AE,  as  well  as  limited 
information on subsequent anticancer therapies may have been available for participants who discontinued 
study treatment due to an AE and then withdrew consent from further participation in the study. Time from 
Assessment report

discontinuation due to AE to disease progression was shorter in the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib arm than in 
the control arm, although the low number of subjects assessed should be noted. However, the outcome in 
terms of OS and PFS of patients who discontinued treatment due to AE in the two arms appear similar. The 
post-hoc nature of the analyses provided as well as the low number of subjects analysed, especially in the 
TPC  arm,  is  acknowledged.  However,  the  data  provided  remarked  that  pembrolizumab+lenvatinib 
combination does not have a trivial toxicity, suggesting its use in a more fit population possibly more able 
to tolerate such treatment. Also in this context, the inclusion of more detailed information on the patient 
population selected in the study (i.e. with exclusion criteria related to the known toxicity of lenvatinib) is 
considered relevant. 
Although crossover was not permitted, in the control arm 9.1% of ITT patients and 7.7% of pMMR patients 
received pembrolizumab+lenvatinib as subsequent line. It’s unlikely that this had relevant impact on final 
OS results.  
Most of the patients receiving subsequent therapy, were indeed able to receive at least two additional lines 
of  treatment,  and  a  relevant  percentage  also  3  or  more.  Taking  into  account  the  dismal  prognosis  of 
endometrial cancer, this observation could further underline the fact that subjects enrolled in this study 
were more fit than the general population with advanced pretreated endometrial cancer as discussed above. 
No relevant differences are seen in older patients from an efficacy perspective. The PFS, OS and ORR benefit 
of  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  compared  to  TPC  was  consistent  across  classes  of  age  in  KEYNOTE-775 
study.  
No major differences are seen between arms in the PRO. However, PRO data in the context of an open-
label study should be interpreted with caution.  
pMMR population  
The results in the pMMR subgroup, representing about 85% of the all-comers, were overall similar although 
slightly inferior compared to the whole population, but were still statistically significant and can be deemed 
clinically  relevant.  OS  HR  was  0.68  (0.56,  0.84,  p=0.0001  one  sided),  with  improvement  in  median  OS 
from 12 months in the control arm to 17.4 months in the investigational arm, with similar appearance of 
the OS curves as the all comers. The PFS event rate was slightly higher in the investigational arm, but with 
a final PFS improvement (HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.50, 0.72, p<0.0001 one sided, median PFS 6.6 vs 3.8 months). 
PFS sensitivity analyses and PFS2 (HR 0.62) support the primary results. An improvement was seen also 
in terms of ORR (30.3% vs 15.1%), median DOR (9.2 vs 5.7 months) and durable responses (65.6% vs 
42.1% responses lasted ≥6 months).       
Subgroup analyses 
Treatment  benefit  in  terms  of  OS,  PFS  and  ORR  for  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  compared  with  TPC 
appears overall consistent across all major subgroups analysed, in pMMR and all-comer participants.  
dMMR subgroup 
The dMMR subgroup was not prespecified in the multiplicity strategy for Type I error control, therefore only 
nominal p-values have been provided for the efficacy endpoints. MMR status was however a stratification 
factor.  
A  total  of  130  (65  in  each  arm)  had  a  tumor  status  of  dMMR,  representing  15.7%  of  the  all  comers 
population.  The  rate  of  patients  still  receiving  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  at  the  data  cut-off  date  was 
higher in the dMMR compared to the pMMR subgroup (45.3% vs 27.9%). Baseline characteristics in the 
Assessment report

dMMR subgroup were balanced between treatment arms and quite similar to the pMMR population, with 
the  exception  of  histology,  as  most  of  the  pMMR  tumor  were  endometrioid:  this  is  however  in  line  with 
literature data21. The rate of patients still receiving pembrolizumab + lenvatinib at the data cut-off date 
was higher in the dMMR compared to the pMMR subgroup (45.3% vs 27.9%). 
The combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was superior to TPC with respect to PFS and OS for the 
treatment of dMMR participants. Although dMMR was not statistically tested, PFS and OS benefit are deemed 
clinically relevant, and efficacy of the combination appears higher compared to what observed in the pMMR 
population (PFS HR 0.36, OS HR 0.37, ORR 40% vs 12.3%, CR 13.8% vs 3.1%, median DOR NR vs 4.1 
months).  
The efficacy results in the control arm of dMMR subgroup appear quite similar to the control arm of pMMR 
population,  although  the limited  number of  subjects  preclude  further  conclusion.  OS  data  for pMMR  and 
dMMR populations are reflected in the section 5.1 of the SmPC 
Contribution of components to the combination 
Results from Study 204, KEYNOTE-158, and KEYNOTE-028 in order to provide evidence of the contribution 
of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapies  to  the  efficacy  of  the  combination  were  provided. 
KEYNOTE-158 is a phase 2 study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with multiple types of 
advanced solid tumors progressed after standard of care therapy. Efficacy results for a total of 79 dMMR 
and  90  dMMR  endometrial  cancer  patients  have  been  provided,  together  with  24  subjects  who  received 
pembrolizumab in the phase 1 study KEYNOTE-028. The evidence for lenvatinib monotherapy comes from 
133 patients treated within the phase II single arm Study-204, for whom however the MMR status was 
not  determined.  The  dose  of  lenvatinib  used  in  Study-204  (24  mg  OD)  was  higher  than  what  used  in 
combination with pembrolizumab in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 (20 mg OD). On the contrary, the same dose 
of pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) was used in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 and -158. When comparing the 
baseline characteristics of the four studies, some differences are noted, most relevant being that patients 
in KEYNOTE-775 have better performance status compared to patients enrolled in the supportive studies, 
and  that  patients  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  studies  KEYNOTE-158  and  -028  were  more 
pretreated.  It  cannot  be  excluded  that  this  could  have  possibly improved  the  outcome  of  KEYNOTE-775 
population with respect to subjects receiving monotherapy in the supportive studies. The lack of data on 
PD-L1 expression in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 at this stage is a limit for data interpretation.  
For the pMMR subgroup, the ORR of Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 [30.3% (95%CI 25.5, 35.5)], including rate 
of  CR  (5.2%)  is  indeed  greater  than  ORRs  and  CRs  observed  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  [ORR  14.3%, 
95%CI 8.8, 21.4; CR 2.6%) and for pembrolizumab monotherapy [ORR 7.8% (95%CI 3.2, 15.4) with 0% 
of CR in KEYNOTE-158; ORR 9.5% (95%CI 1.2, 30.4), CR 4.8%]. The lower bound of the 95% CI of the 
ORR  for  lenvatinib  +  pembrolizumab  was  greater  than  that  of  the  observed  point  estimate  for  either 
lenvatinib or pembrolizumab administered as monotherapy. Based on the overall data available, a limited 
activity  of  both  pembrolizumab  and  lenvatinib  as  single  agents  is  observed  in  previously  treated 
advanced/metastatic  endometrial  cancer  with  pMMR  based  on  single-arm  data.  The  indirect  comparison 
appears  to  support  the  hypothesis  that  each  component  is  contributing  to  the  treatment  effect  in  the 
combination  regimen.  The  limit  of  cross-study  comparison  should  be  however  noted,  hampering  the 
possibility to draw definitive conclusion. No meaningful conclusion can be made with regard to OS, especially 
in view of some differences in baseline characteristics among studies, as well as the difficulties in evaluating 
time-related endpoints in single-arm studies.

In patients with dMMR endometrial cancer, the activity of the combination pembrolizumab + lenvatinib in 
KEYNOTE-775 appears similar to what shown by pembrolizumab alone in KEYNOTE-158, in terms of ORR, 
rate  of  CR,  and  DOR.  Also  PFS  and  OS  did  not  suggest  relevant  differences,  acknowledging  the  overall 
limited number of dMMR patients as well as the limitation in the assessment of time-related endpoints in 
the  single  arm  study.  It  is  noted  that  in  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  study,  the  overall  number  of  dMMR 
patients is limited, which is consistent with the expected prevalence of this treatment setting. As a result, 
confidence intervals are wide. These aspects limit the ability to make cross-study comparison. Furthermore, 
KEYNOTE-775 study was designed and powered to compare lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab with TPC in the 
pMMR and all-comer populations. However, although the wide confidence intervals in Study 309/KEYNOTE-
775 are noted, both the point estimates and the confidence intervals of all efficacy endpoints do not suggest 
any  relevant  difference  in  activity  of  the  combination  as  compared  to  pembrolizumab  alone  in  dMMR 
pretreated EC. 
The  MAH  argued  that  the  KM  curve  for  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  in  Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775 demonstrates a lower PFS event rate within the first 3 months of treatment initiation 
compared  with  the  KM  curve  for  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  in  KEYNOTE-158,  suggesting  more  rapid 
disease  control  with  the  addition  of  lenvatinib  to  pembrolizumab  compared  with  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy.  However,  this  is  not  supported  as  the  same  time  to  response  was  observed  with  the 
combination and the monotherapy. It is recognised that a higher rate of stable disease was reported with 
the combination, but it is not clear whether this translate to a long-term benefit, as no relevant difference 
are envisaged in PFS and OS between combination and monotherapy based on indirect comparison.  
In conclusion, it is acknowledged that the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed superiority 
to TPC with respect to PFS, OS and ORR for the treatment of dMMR participants in Study 309/KEYNOTE-
775, although the dMMR subgroup was not formally tested. The cross-study comparison, acknowledging its 
limitations, suggests that the activity of the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib combination is not significantly 
different as compared to pembrolizumab alone in dMMR EC population. While the lack of direct comparison 
of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in 2L dMMR endometrial cancer is a 
limitation  in  the  dossier,  this  study  has  shown  a  substantial  improvement  in  all  efficacy  endpoints  for 
pembrolizumab  and  lenvatinib  against  chemotherapy  in  dMMR  endometrial  cancer,  which  is  fully 
acknowledged.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, favourable efficacy of the pembrolizumab with lenvatinib combination is observed consistently for 
primary  and  secondary  endpoints.  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  and 
clinically meaningful advantage in OS and PFS of the combination pembrolizumab + lenvatinib as compared 
to  standard  chemotherapy  (doxorubicin  or  paclitaxel,  TPC)  in  advanced  endometrial  cancer  patients 
progressed to at least one prior platinum-based therapy. Even though the median OS improvement was 
found in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group over TPC, OS data is not fully mature yet and this limits 
the efficacy estimation at this moment. Therefore the MAH is recommended to submit the results from the 
final OS analysis in the overall population and by MMR biomarker (expected in Q4 2022). 
ORR for the combination was not outstanding but was doubled compared to the standard treatment. DOR, 
PFS2 and PFS sensitivity analyses further support the benefit of the combination.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
To support the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab (oral lenvatinib 20 
mg QD in combination with IV pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W) for the treatment of patients with advanced 
EC who have disease progression following prior platinum-based systemic therapy in any setting and are 
not  candidates  for  curative  surgery  or  radiation,  interim  analysis  data  from  the  pivotal,  open-label, 
randomized Phase 3, Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 are submitted.       
•  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  combination  lenvatinib  +  pembrolizumab  (N=406):  Subjects  with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma who had disease progression following prior platinum-based systemic 
therapy, who received combination treatment with lenvatinib + pembrolizumab in Study 309/KEYNOTE-
775. (KN-775 lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group) 
•  Study  309/KEYNOTE-775  chemotherapy  doxorubicin  or  paclitaxel  (N=388):  Subjects  with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma who had disease progression following prior platinum-based systemic 
therapy, who received combination chemotherapy treatment with doxorubicin and paclitaxel in Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775. (TPC group) 
In addition, 3 supportive safety datasets are presented: 
•  Combination lenvatinib +pembrolizumab – Non-endometrial (N=230): Pooled safety data from 
participants with confirmed metastatic selected solid tumor types (excluding endometrial carcinoma) 
treated with the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab combination in Study 111/KEYNOTE-146. (Lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab non-EC group) 
•  Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set  (N=1119):  Pooled  safety  data  from  participants treated  with 
lenvatinib monotherapy in 11 studies. (Lenvatinib monotherapy Safety Dataset) 
•  Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  Reference  Safety  Dataset  (N=5884):  Pooled  safety  data  from 
participants treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, including all participants who received at least 
one dose of pembrolizumab in in melanoma, lung, cHL, bladder, and HNSCC in EU-approved conditions 
(KN001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3, KN002 (original phase), KN006, KN010, KN012 cohort B and 
B2,  KN013  cohort  3,  KN024,  KN040,  KN042,  KN045,  KN048,  KN052,  KN054,  KN055  and  KN087). 
(Pembrolizumab monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset) 
To  assess  potential  indication-specific  safety  concerns,  the  safety  profile  of  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab 
observed  in  KN-775  (endometrial  carcinoma)  is  compared  with  that  found  in  the  non-endometrial 
Carcinoma Safety Dataset from Study 111/KEYNOTE-146. 
Data from the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Dataset and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD are used

Safety Data Supporting Section 4.8 Of Summary Of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC combines in a new single column the ADRs from pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib 
and  pembrolizumab  plus  axitinib  therapies.  Pembrolizumab  plus  Lenvatinib  is  based  on  KEYNOTE-581 
(Study 307), KEYNOTE-146 (Study 111) and KEYNOTE-775 (Study 309), and pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
is based on KEYNOTE-426. 
The frequencies included are based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator 
assessment of causality.  
Adverse reactions included in Table 2 of the SmPC: 
Table below encompasses the adverse reactions included in Table 2 of the SmPC section 4.8 with related 
frequency categories and figures from the KEYNOTE-581, KEYNOTE-146, KEYNOTE-775, and KEYNOTE-426 
studies with the combination of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib or pembrolizumab plus axitinib. 
Database cutoff dates were:  
-

for Endometrial Cancer: KN146 18AUG2020; KN775 26OCT2020; 
for RCC: KN426 24AUG2018; KN581 28AUG2020 
The criteria for populating Table 2 in the Keytruda SmPC are as follows (meeting at least one of the 
criteria): 
- 
- 
- 
Keytruda ADR terms in the monotherapy column carried over for all subsequent columns when 
observed for the combination and adjusted to the appropriate frequency category based on the 
pooled data 
Agency mandated terms 
AEs not already ADRs for Keytruda and occurring at an incidence higher than the respective 
monotherapy safety profiles were assessed for additive or potentiated effect and clinical relevance. 
No new ADRs were assessed for the individual monotherapies or for the combination; therefore, no new 
ADRs were added.

Deaths Due to Adverse Events 
PTs reported more than once in the KN-775 lenavitinib+pembrolizumab arm were: death (n=5; 1.2%) and 
pneumonia (n=2; 0.5%). The PT “death” was reported in situations where limited information on the cause 
of death was available, or where the investigator could not assign a specific AE term in a participant with 
comorbidities and confounding factors that led to death.  
Out  of  the  23  subjects  with  fatal  event  receiving  combination  treatment,  6  participants  (1.5%)  were 
assessed by the investigator as having drug-related AEs resulting in death: 
-  1 death due to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome was considered by the investigator as related to 
both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab; 
-  1  death  each  due  to  cerebrovascular  accident,  right  ventricular  dysfunction,  myelodysplastic 
syndrome, and death were considered by the investigator as related to lenvatinib; 
-  1 death due to colitis was considered by the investigator as related to pembrolizumab. 
Of  19  participants  in  the  TPC  group  who  experienced  AEs  resulting  in  death,  8  deaths  (2.1%)  were 
considered related to study intervention by the investigator. These events were all considered related to 
doxorubicin:  2  events  of  pneumonia,  and  1  event  each  of  aspiration,  pulmonary  embolism,  cardiogenic 
shock, toxic cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, and sepsis.

Table 102  – Participants with clinically significant adverse events by maximum toxicity grade 
(incidence >0% in one or more treatment groups) 
In KN-775, the following AEs were considered CSAEs, and were reported with decreasing frequency in the 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  combination  arm  and  are  shown  in  respect  to  Lenvatinib  monotherapy  SD: 
Hypothyroidism  (68.2%  vs  19.8%),  Hypertension  (65%  vs  62.8%),  Hepatotoxicity  (33.7%  vs  17.5%), 
Proteinuria  (29.6%  vs  35.3%),  Hemorrhage  (24.4%  vs  32.8%),  Palmar-plantar  Erythrodysesthesia

Syndrome  (22.2%  vs  22.3%),  Renal  Events  (18.2%  vs  10.0%),  GI  Perforation  (3.9%  vs  2.2%), 
Hypocalcemia (3.9% vs 8.8%), QT Prolongation (3.9% vs 4.8%), Arterial Thromboembolic Events (3.7% 
vs 5.7%), Fistula Formation (2.5% vs 2.1%), Cardiac Dysfunction (1.0% vs 5.5%), Posterior Reversible 
Encephalopathy Syndrome (0.2% vs 0.3%). Creatinine increased was found in 10.8% of subjects receiving 
combination treatment and in 2.6% of those receiving TPC. 
CSAEs reported in the KN-775 combination arm at data cut-off resolved in 20.8%, were resolving in 14%, 
and not resolved in 61% of cases. 
Hepatotoxicity CSAEs 
Hepatotoxicity CSAEs were observed more frequently in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group compared 
with the lenvatinib monotherapy and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC groups (33.7%, 17.5%, and 
19.6%, respectively). CSAE severity was mostly Grade 1 to 3 and median time to onset was 56 days. The 
increased frequency in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group was primarily driven by the incidence of 
ALT increased (21.2%) and AST increased (19.7%). Most ALT or AST increases were Grade 1 to 3, most 
did not result in discontinuation, and most were considered resolved or resolving. 
Hypothyroidism CSAEs 
The CSAE “hypothyroidism” was observed more frequently in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group than 
in  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  and  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  groups  (68.2%,  19.8%,  and 
43.5%,  respectively).  Most  events  of  hypothyroidism  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  were 
Grade 1 or 2, and median time to onset was 62 days. Most CSAEs did not result in treatment discontinuation, 
and most were treated with hormone replacement and were considered resolved at data cut-off (22%). 
Renal events CSAEs 
The incidence of the CSAE “renal events” was higher in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (18.2%) 
compared  with  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group  (10%),  and  was  similar  to  that  of  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab non-EC group (18.7%). Most renal events were Grade 1 or 2, and median time to onset 
was 86 days. Few renal events resulted in treatment discontinuation, and most were considered resolved 
or resolving. The most frequently reported renal event was blood creatinine increased 10.8% in the KN-
775 combination arm. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest for Pembrolizumab (AEOSIs) 
AEOSI are immune-related events and infusion-related reactions associated with pembrolizumab treatment.

Most AEOSI in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (approximately 81%) were mild to moderate in 
severity (Grade 1 or 2). Most Grade 3 to 4 AEOSI were reported in ≤1% of participants in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab group, except for Grade 3 severe skin reactions (2.5%), Grade 3 colitis (1.5%), and 
Grade 3 hepatitis (1.5%). There was 1 death in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group due to an AEOSI 
of colitis, which was considered by the investigator to be related to pembrolizumab. One participant died 
of autoimmune encephalitis; however, as the death was beyond the 120-day post-treatment AE collection 
period it was not captured as a fatal event in tables or listings. 
Hypothyroidism 
Hypothyroidism was observed more frequently in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group compared with 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group or the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (57.6%, 37.8%, 
11.1%, respectively). 
Most  events  of  hypothyroidism  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  were  Grade  1  (17.2%)  or  2 
(39.2%) in severity and only 1 (0.2%) resulted in treatment discontinuation. Few events of hypothyroidism 
were treated with corticosteroids (0.4%) and were instead treated with hormone replacement therapy, as 
per protocol. Most hypothyroidism in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group were considered not resolved 
(n=145/234, 62.0%) as of the data cutoff. 
The median time to onset for events of hypothyroidism in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (63.0 
days) was shorter than that in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (105.0 days). The median episode 
duration  has  not  been  reached  for  either  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  or  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD. 
Hyperthyroidism 
Hyperthyroidism was observed more frequently in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group compared with 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group or the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (11.6%, 4.8%, 
and 4.2%, respectively). 
Most  events  of  hyperthyroidism  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  were  Grade  1  (7.4%)  or  2 
(3.4%)  in  severity  and  none  resulted  in  treatment discontinuation.  Few  events  of  hyperthyroidism  were 
treated with corticosteroids (4.3%), and most were considered resolved (n=41/47, 87.2%). 
The median time to onset for hyperthyroidism in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (43.0 days) was 
consistent with that in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (44.0 days); however, the median episode 
duration was shorter than that in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (43.0 days vs 56.0 days). 
Colitis 
Colitis in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group was observed at a similar frequency as in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab non-EC group, but more frequently if compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy 
RSD (4.7%, 5.7%, and 1.9%, respectively). 
Most  events  of  colitis  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  (11  of  19,  approximately  58%)  were 
Grade 1 (1.2%) or 2 (1.5%) in severity, 6 (1.5%) were Grade 3, 1 was Grade 4, and 1 was fatal. Four 
events  of  colitis  resulted  in  treatment  discontinuation  (3  participants  discontinued  both  lenvatinib  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/617606/2021

pembrolizumab,  1  discontinued  lenvatinib).  Eight  events  of  colitis  were  treated  with  corticosteroids 
(42.1%), and most were considered resolved (n=12/19, 63.2%). 
The median time to onset for colitis was longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (161.0 days) 
compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (132.0 days). The median episode duration was similar 
compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (31.0 vs 27.0 days). 
Laboratory findings 
All-grade  ALT  increased  and  AST  increased  were  found,  respectively,  in  53.4%  and  58.3%  of  KN-775 
combination treatment participants and in 20.7% and 22.4% of controls. Frequency was higher than in the 
lenvatinib monotherapy SD (41.1% and 41.7%), the non-EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group (35.1% and 
43.6%) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (27.5% and 28.5%). Most events were Grade 1 or 2. 
Cholesterol increased and Triglycerides increased of all-grades were observed, respectively, in 53.3% and 
69.2% of subjects receiving combination treatment, which was somehow comparable with the proportion 
in the non-EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group (49.5% and 66.4%), but higher than in the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (21.9% and 35%). Most events were Grade 1 or 2.    
Overall, 57.1% of subjects treated with lenvatinib+pembrolizumab had Glucose increased, while this AE 
was found in the lenvatinib monotherapy SD in 14.4%, in the non-EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group in 
25.8%, and in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD in 11.6%.  
Hypomagnesemia events were 53.6% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 38.3% in the non-
EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group. Most events were of grade 1 or 2.  
The most frequently (incidence ≥5%) reported Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab group were: 
Lymphocyte decreased (16.9%), sodium decreased (14.4%), potassium decreased (10.7%), AST increased 
(8.5%),  hemoglobin  decreased  (8.2%),  phosphate  decreased  (8.2%),  glucose  increased  (8.0%),  ALT 
increased  (7.7%),  platelets  decreased  (7.2%),  triglycerides  increased  (7.1%),  magnesium  decreased

Pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD: drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs were 19.2% vs 17.9 and 13.5%, drug-
related SAEs 12.7 vs 12.3% and 10.2%, drug-related discontinuation due to AE 5.4% vs 4.7 and 3.6%, 
drug-related fatal events 0.8% vs 0.7% and 0.6%. 
The incidences and severity of the most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥15%) in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab and TPC groups were provided. Rates were generally similar between the different age 
categories, with the following AEs having >10% difference between any age category (<65, 65-74, and 
≥75 age groups) for the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group: 
o Anaemia: 27.3%, 22.9%, 34.3% 
o UTI: 22.0%, 28.3%, 34.4% 
o Hypertension: Grade 3 and higher 33.2%, 42.2%, 45.7% 
Tables with the AE Summary and AEOSIs AE categories by 75-year age cut-off (i.e. <75 and ≥75 years) 
were  also  provided.  Safety  assessment  of  pembrolizumab+lenvatinib  is  limited  by  the  small  number  of 
subjects  aged  >75  years  in  the  KN-775  Study  and  the  pooled  pembrolizumab+lenvatinib  datasets. 
Compared to the younger age group, older aged subjects showed higher proportions of subjects with drug-
related  SAEs,  who  discontinued  any  drug  due  to  AE,  and  who  died  due  to  a  drug-related  AE  in  both 
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib  datasets  (KN-775,  pooled  pembrolizumab+lenavtinib)  as  well  as  in  the 
lenvatinitb monotherapy safety dataset. Proportions of AEOSIs AE categories were generally not dissimilar 
between  KN-775  age  groups  (<75  y  vs  >75  y).  Safety  profile  across  age  groups  was  not  significantly 
different in subjects receiving TPC in KN-775 and in those of the pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset.  
Sex 
As  in  KN-775  study  all  participants  were  females,  sub-group  analysis  based  on  sex  is  not  considered

Ethnicity 
There was a limited number of participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC treatment 
groups who were Asian (n=85 and n=86, respectively); therefore, the data should be interpreted with 
caution. 
Within the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and TPC groups, the overall incidence and severity of AEs was 
generally similar between the different race categories. 
The incidences and severity of the most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥15%) in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab group were generally similar between the different race categories  with the following 
differences (>10% difference) within the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group noted: 
• AEs higher in Whites than Asians: Abdominal pain (23.0% vs 8.2%), UTI (29.7% vs 12.9%), diarrhoea 
(57.4% vs 47.1%; Grade ≥3: 7.4% vs 10.6%), weight decreased (37.1% vs 27.1%), hypomagnesaemia

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food and 
DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the CYP enzymes, and other metabolizing 
enzymes,  are  not  expected  to  interfere  with  the  metabolism  of  an  IgG  antibody.  The  IgG  antibodies,  in 
general, do not directly regulate the expression of CYP enzymes, other enzymes, or transporters involved 
in drug elimination. 
Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been performed. In addition, in vitro experiments and studies 
conducted  in  preclinical  species  have  been  shown  to  have  limited  value  in  predicting  DDI  potential  in 
humans. Therefore, no preclinical PK studies were conducted to assess the propensity of pembrolizumab to 
be a victim or perpetrator of PK DDIs. 
The main metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde 
oxidase)  and  non-enzymatic  processes.  The  IC50  values  for  the  9  main  CYP  isoforms,  the  5  main  UGT 
isoforms,  AO,  and  the  11  transporters  tested  were  more  than  4  μM,  suggesting  lenvatinib  is  not  a 
perpetrator of DDI at the maximum dose of 24 mg QD. 
Lenvatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but was not a substrate any of the other transporters evaluated. 
No formal PK drug interaction studies have been conducted with pembrolizumab. Since pembrolizumab is 
a  mAb,  PK  interactions  with  lenvatinib  are  not  expected.  Studies  evaluating  pharmacodynamic  drug 
interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. However, as systemic corticosteroids may be 
used  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  to  ameliorate  potential  side  effects,  the  potential  for  a 
pharmacokinetic  DDI  with  pembrolizumab  as  a  victim  was  assessed  as  part  of  the  population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids 
and  pembrolizumab  exposure.  Nevertheless, 
the  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  or  other 
immunosuppressants  before  the  start  of  pembrolizumab  treatment  should  be  avoided  because  of  their 
potential  interference  with  the  pharmacodynamic  activity  and  efficacy  of  pembrolizumab.  However, 
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting pembrolizumab treatment 
to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions.

decreased,  decreased  appetite,  proteinuria,  diarrhea,  and  vomiting.  The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs 
resulting in pembrolizumab discontinuation (regardless of action taken for lenvatinib) was higher for the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  (9.9%)  as  compared  to  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  group 
(5.2%).  ALT  increased  was  the  only  AE  in  the  Lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  resulting  in 
pembrolizumab discontinuation in ≥1% of participants. 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The incidence of AEs resulting in lenvatinib interruption (regardless of action taken for pembrolizumab) was 
similar  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  (58.6%)  and  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group 
(67.6%). AEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group resulting in lenvatinib discontinuation in ≥5% of 
participants included hypertension, diarrhea, proteinuria, and vomiting. The incidence of AEs resulting in 
pembrolizumab  interruption  (regardless  of  action  taken  for  lenvatinib)  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group (50.0%) than in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD group (25.4%). Diarrhea was 
the only AE in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group resulting in pembrolizumab discontinuation in ≥5% 
of participants. 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in interruption of both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was similar in 
the lenvatinib plus  pembrolizumab  group  (30.8%)  and  the lenvatinib  plus pembrolizumab non-EC  group 
(38.7%). 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Interruption 
The  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  resulting  in  lenvatinib  interruption  (regardless  of  action  taken  for 
pembrolizumab)  was  lower  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  (45.8%)  than  in  the  lenvatinib 
monotherapy  group  (61.3%).  Drug  related  AEs  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  resulting  in 
lenvatinib discontinuation in ≥2% of participants included hypertension, diarrhea, proteinuria, decreased 
appetite, vomiting, fatigue, nausea, and weight decreased. The incidence of AEs resulting in pembrolizumab 
interruption  (regardless  of  action  taken  for  lenvatinib)  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab 
group  (25.6%)  than  in  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  group  (14.2%).  Drug-related  AEs  in  the 
lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  resulting  in  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  in  ≥2%  of  participants 
included diarrhea and ALT increased. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction of Lenvatinib 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  dose  reduction  of  lenvatinib  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group (66.5%) than in the lenvatinib monotherapy group (47.5%). The most frequently 
reported (incidence ≥10%) AEs leading to lenvatinib dose reduction were hypertension and diarrhea in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group. 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in a dose reduction of lenvatinib in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
group (66.5%) was consistent with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab non-EC group (66.1%). 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Dose-Reduction of Lenvatinib 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  resulting  in  dose  reduction  of  lenvatinib  was  higher  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group (65.0%) than in the lenvatinib monotherapy group (46.2%). The most frequently 
reported  (incidence  ≥5%)  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  lenvatinib  dose  reduction  were  hypertension, 
diarrhea,  PPES,  proteinuria,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  and  weight  decreased  in  the  lenvatinib  plus 
pembrolizumab group.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of lenvatinib was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the period 
13-FEB-2019 through 12-FEB-2020. The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic 
Safety Update Report covering the period 04-SEP-2019 through 03-SEP-2020. 
No revocation or withdrawal of lenvatinib or pembrolizumab or registration for safety reasons has occurred 
in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure and study population characteristics 
As of KN-775 data cut-off, median duration of treatment exposure for the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group 
was more than twice as long as for the TPC group (7.59 vs 3.43 months, respectively). Drug exposure >=6 
and  >=12  months  was  reached  by  respectively  59.9%  and  27.1%  of  participants  receiving  combination 
treatment, and by 10.8% and 2.6% of the participants treated with TPC. While median duration of exposure 
was slightly longer for non-EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab safety DS (9.79 months), it was shorter for both 
the  monotherapy  safety  DS  (5.55  for  Lenvatinib  and  4.86  for  pembrolizumab).  With  regards  to  dose 
exposure,  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  participants  received  a mean  dose  lenvatinib  dose  of  69% 
(range, 16-100) on the total planned starting dose, and a mean number of pembrolizumab administrations 
of 12 (1-35). In the KN-775 lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group, median duration on lenvatinib was 211.5 
(SD+191.3) days and 211.0 (SD+190.9) days for pembrolizumab.   
Concerning population characteristics, study participants of KN-775, as expected, were all females, whereas 
the non-EC lenvatinib-pembrolizumab safety dataset comprised both genders. KN-775 treatment groups 
were well-balanced for patient characteristics (age category >65 years in ~50%, ~2/3 white, ECOG PS 0 
in  ~60%),  and  geographic  region  of  enrolment  was  similar  across  study  arms,  with  a  slightly  lower 
prevalence  of  EU-based  participants  in  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  as  compared  to  the  TPC  group 
(28% vs 33%, respectively). 
Safety profile 
In KN-775 study, the summary of AEs, despite showing similar overall proportions of subjects with at least 
one  AE  in  the  two  arms  (99.8%  and  99.5%  in  the  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  and  the  TPC  group, 
respectively)  displayed  a  worse  safety  profile  for  the  combination  treatment  group  when  compared  to 
standard  chemotherapy,  as  shown  by  higher  proportions  of  subjects  with  drug-related  AEs  (97.3%  vs 
93.8%, respectively), Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (77.8% vs 59%), drug-related SAEs (33.3% vs 14.2%), 
who had dose interruption of any drug due to an AE (69.2% vs 27.1%) or who discontinued any drug due 
to  a  drug  related  AE  (26.6%  vs  5.7%).  Proportions  of  fatal  events  and  drug-related  fatal  events  were 
comparable across study arms.  
When  evaluating  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  including  multiple  occurrences  of  events,  a  partially 
reversed  safety  picture  is  found.  In  fact,  lower  incidence  rates  per  100  person-months  are  registered, 
respectively, in the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group when compared to the control group for the following 
safety items: AEs 231 vs 256, drug-related AEs 133 vs 153, Grade 3-5 AEs 31.02 vs 48.78, drug-related 
Assessment report

Grade 3-5 AEs 18.52 vs 34.5. For SAEs (10.15 and 10.08 per 100 person-months in the combination arm 
and controls, respectively), drug-related SAEs (5.15 and 4.08), deaths (0.59 and 1.08), and deaths due to 
drug-related AE (0.15 and 0.45) the incidence rate of events was quite comparable across study arms. On 
the contrary, the proportion of subjects with dose modification (37.9 vs 18.6 per 100 person-months), dose 
interruption  (21  vs  11.5),  dose  reduction  (15  vs  4.76),  and  discontinuation  due  to  AE  (5  vs  2.32)  all 
remained higher in the study group of interest. 
Overall exposure-adjusted AE incidence rate in the KN-775 pembrolizumab-lenvatinib group (231.94 per 
100 person-months of exposure) was: 
- lower than the rate for KN-775 TPC group (256.41 per 100 person-months of exposure);   
- comparable to rates for the non-EC pembrolizumab-lenvatinib dataset (232.30 per 100 person-months of 
exposure) and the lenvatinib monotherapy dataset (226.70); 
- higher than the rate reported for the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (128.64 per 100 person-months 
of exposure).  
At safety comparisons between KN-775 group of interest and the other three safety datasets, the safety 
profile  of  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  was  consistent  with  that  of  the  non-EC  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab 
dataset and mirrored that of the lenvatinib monotherapy, showing however slightly higher proportions of 
subjects with drug-related grade 3-5 AEs (77.8% vs 65.7%), drug-related SAEs (33.3% vs 25.7%), and 
who  discontinued  any  drug  due  to  drug-related  AEs  (26.6%  vs  18.6%).  In  respect  to  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, combination treatment showed a considerably worse safety profile with increased frequencies 
of drug-related AEs (97.3% vs 70.2%), grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (77.8% vs 15.5%), drug-related SAEs 
(33.3%  vs  11.1%),  subjects  who  discontinued  due  to  AEs  (33%  vs  13.4%)  in  the  KN-775 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group.  
The most common AEs (occurring in >30% of subjects) in the KN-775 lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group 
were  the  following  with  decreasing  frequency:  hypertension  (64%),  hypothyroidism  (57.4%),  diarrhoea 
(54.2%),  nausea  (49.5%),  decreased  appetite  (44.8%),  vomiting  (36.7%),  weight  decreased  (34%), 
fatigue  (33%),  arthralgia  (30.5%).  In  the  TPC  arm  the  following  AEs  had  >30%  incidence  (decreasing 
frequency):  anaemia  (48.7%),  nausea  (46.1%),  neutropenia  (33.8%),  alopecia  (30.9%).  The  risk 
difference (>30%) favouring TPC in respect to lenvatinib+pembrolizumab was greatest for hypertension, 
hypothyroidism, diarrhoea. 
Most  commonly  reported AEs  for  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  treatment  were  consistent  with  the 
safety  pattern  found  in  the  non-EC  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  SD,  and  mirrored  the  well-known  safety 
profile  of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapies,  showing  however  higher  proportions  for  most 
frequently reported most common AEs, as compared with single-drug therapies. The ADR table in section 
4.8 of the SmPC combines in a new single column the ADRs from pembrolizumab+lenvatinib (KEYNOTE-
581,  KEYNOTE-146,  KEYNOTE-775)  and  pembrolizumab+axitinib  (KEYNOTE-426).  Identification  of  ADRs 
for pembrolizumab when given in combination with lenvatinib or axitinib for treatment of EC and RCC is 
based on frequency of harmful events found in a pooled dataset of several active-controlled trials (KN-581, 
KN-775, KN-426) and a single-arm cohort (KN-146). Further, it takes advantage of the well-established 
safety profiles of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib and axitinib when given as monotherapies.  
The proportion of subjects with drug-related AEs were similar in KN-775 combination treatment and control 
arms, as well as in the lenvatinib monotherapy dataset (97.3%, 93.8% and 94.7%, respectively), while in 
the pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset a lower proportion is observed (70.2%). Drug-related AEs with 
the  highest  incidence  rates  (>=30%  incidence)  in  the  KN-775  combination  treatment  group  were  the 
Assessment report

following, as compared to the TPC arm: hypertension (61.1% vs 1%, respectively), hypothyroidism (54.4% 
vs 0), diarrhoea (42.1% vs 10.8%), nausea (38.9% vs 40.5%), decreased appetite (36.7% vs 16.5%). 
Type  of  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  in  the  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  was 
consistent with drug-related AEs of the lenvatinib monotherapy dataset.  
In  respect  to  the  non-EC  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  SD,  KN775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  had 
higher  frequency  (>10%  difference)  of  the  following  drug-related  AEs:  hypertension  (61.1%  vs  39.1%, 
respectively), hypotyroidism (54.4% vs 33.5%), asthenia (18.5% vs 4.3%), mucosal inflammation (11.1% 
vs 0).  
In  KN-775,  Grade  3-5  AEs  were  reported  in  88.9% of  subjects  receiving  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  and 
72.7%  of  those  receiving  standard  chemotherapy.  While  the  risk  difference  between  study  arms  was  in 
favour  of  the  combination  treatment  for  neutropenia,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  white  blood  cells 
decreased, anaemia, leukopenia and febrile neutropenia, it resulted favouring the TPC arm for hypertension, 
weight  decreased,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea,  proteinuria,  and  lipase  increased.  Also,  drug-related 
Grade 3-5 AEs were found more often in the combination arm when compared to TPC arm (77.8% vs 59%, 
respectively); among these hypertension events (36% vs 0.3%, respectively) were the most prevalent AE 
being the only event with a frequency >10%.  
When  comparing  the  frequency  of  Grade  3-5  AEs  and  of  drug-related  Grade  3-5  AEs  in  the  KN-775 
combination arm (88.9% and 77.8%, respectively) with the supportive safety datasets, proportions were 
comparable or slightly lower in the non-EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab SD (88.3% and 65.7%, respectively) 
and in the lenvatinib monotherapy SD (80.3% and 64.7%, respectively), while being much higher than in 
the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (48.1% and 15.5%, respectively). 
In KN-775, non-fatal SAEs were reported in 52.7% of subjects treated with lenvatinib+pembrolizumab and 
in 30.4% of those treated with TPC. Similar findings were observed in the other lenvatinib-based safety 
datasets: 56.1% in the non-EC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group and 54.8% in the lenvatinib monotherapy 
SD. In the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD a lower proportion of subjects developed SAEs (38.5%).  Most 
commonly recorded (>2% incidence) SAEs for the KN combination arm were the following: hypertension 
(4.2%), UTI (3.2%), diarrhoea (2.5%), decreased appetite (2.2%), and vomiting (2.2%). Risk difference 
between study arms showed that non-fatal SAEs favouring the combination arm were febrile neutropenia, 
anaemia,  and  neutropenia,  while  those  in  favour  of  controls  were:  hypertension,  UTI,  and  decreased 
appetite. In KN-775, drug-related non-fatal SAEs occurred in 33.3% of subjects receiving at least one dose 
of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab and in 14.2% of those receiving at least one dose of chemotherapy. 
Fatal AEs occurred in 5.7% of subjects participating to the KN-775 lenvatinib+permbrolizumab group and 
in 4.9% of those participating to the TPC group, suggesting that there was no increased risk of death in the 
group of interest. Overall, proportion of deaths in the KN-775 lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group was lower 
than in the non-EC lenvatinitib+pembrolizumab (10.4%) and the lenvatinib monotherapy (8.7%) datasets, 
and comparable to that of the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (5.3%). Number of fatal events assessed 
by the KN-775 investigator to be drug-related were 6/23 (1.5%) in the combination treatment group and 
8/19 (2.1%) in the TPC group. 
Clinically Significant Adverse Events for Lenvatinib (CSAEs) 
When  compared  to  the  non-EC  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  and  the  lenvatinib  monotherapy  DS, 
incidence in the KN lenvatinib+pembrolizumab arm were quite comparable for all-grade CSAEs (94.8% vs 
89.6%  and  86.9%,  respectively),  serious  CSAEs  (19.7%  vs  20.4%  and  18.1%),  and  CSAEs  leading  to 
treatment discontinuation (14.8% vs 10% and 9.7%). The following AEs were considered CSAEs and were 
reported  with  decreasing  frequency  in  the  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  combination  arm: 
Hypothyroidism (68.2%), Hypertension (65%), Hepatotoxicity (33.7%), Proteinuria (29.6%), Hemorrhage 
Assessment report  
EMA/617606/2021 
Page 157/170 
 
 
 
 
 
(24.4%),  Palmar-plantar  Erythrodysesthesia  Syndrome  (22.2%),  Renal  Events  (18.2%),  GI  Perforation 
(3.9%), Hypocalcemia (3.9%), QT Prolongation (3.9%), Arterial Thromboembolic Events (3.7%), Fistula 
Formation (2.5%), Cardiac Dysfunction (1.0%), Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (0.2%).  
Eight deaths (2.0%) due to CSAE were registered in the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group, and 2 out of 
these (cerebrovascular accident and right ventricular dysfunction) were considered by the investigator to 
be related to lenvatinib. As of data cut-off, only a minority (20.8%) of CSAEs had resolved.  
The  frequency  and  severity  of  CSAEs  in  the  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  was  generally 
consistent with those in the non-EC lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and the lenvatinib monotherapy groups, 
with  the  exception  of  the  CSAEs  of  hepatotoxicity  (33.7%  vs  17.5%  and  19.6%,  respectively), 
hypothyroidism  (68.2%  vs  19.8%  and  43.5%),  and  renal  events  (18.2%  vs  10.0%  and  18.7%).  Most 
CSAEs resolved, and only few resulted in treatment discontinuation.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest for pembrolizumab (AEOSIs) 
AEOSIs were reported in 67.2% of KN-775 combination arm participants, and showed a pattern that was 
consistent with the well-established pembrolizumab safety profile. Notably, the overall frequency of AEOSIs 
in 
the  KN-775  combination  arm  was  slightly  higher 
than 
that  reported 
for 
the  non-EC 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  safety  dataset  (51.3%),  but  much  increased  in  respect  to  that  found  in  the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (25.1%).  
Most often reported AEOSIs in the KN-775 combination arm were hypothyroidism (57.6%), hyperthyroidism 
(11.6%),  and  colitis  (4.7%).  The  proportions  of  thyroid  disorders  were  higher  than  in  the  non-EC 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  and  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  RSD  where  hypothyroidism  was 
found in 37.8%, and 11.1%, respectively, and hyperthyroidism in 4.8%, and 4.2%. Frequency of colitis 
was  similar  in  the  non-EC  Lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group,  but  higher  than  for  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy  (1.9%).  In  respect  to  severity,  the  majority  of  AEOSIs  were  Grade  1  and  2,  and  Grade  3 
AEOSIs  were  severe  skin  reactions  (2.5%),  colitis  (1.5%),  and  hepatitis  (1.5%).  One  drug-related  fatal 
event due to a colitis was recorded. In general, AEOSIs were manageable with only few events leading to 
drug  discontinuation.  Outcome  of  AEOSIs  showed  that  most  events  resolved  and  two-thirds  of 
hypothyroidisms persisted at data cut-off.    
Discontinuation due to Adverse events 
In the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab arm, frequencies of AEs leading to dose interruption or dose reduction of 
lenvatinib, or discontinuation of any drug were found, respectively, in 69.2%, 66.5%, and 33.0%, and were 
consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  non-EC  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  (84.8%,  66.1%,  and 
28.3%) and of the lenvatinib monotherapy SD (67.6%, 47.5%, and 26.7%).  
In  KN-775  study,  14.0%  of  participants  discontinued  both  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab,  with 
discontinuation of lenvatinib (30.8%) higher than for pembrolizumab (18.7%). In the KN-775 combination 
arm,  the  only  AE  (incidence  of  ≥1%)  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  was 
intestinal obstruction, while AEs of hypertension, decreased appetite, asthenia, weight decreased, diarrhea, 
proteinuria,  intestinal  obstruction,  and  vomiting  resulted  in  lenvatinib  discontinuation  in  ≥1%  of 
participants, and no AE resulted in pembrolizumab discontinuation in >1% of participants. 
Treatment  discontinuation  was  more  frequent  for  Lenvatinib  than  for  pembrolizumab  (30.8  vs  18.7%). 
While hypertension was the only AE resulting in discontinuation of lenvatinib in >2% of participants, no 
specific AE resulted in >1% discontinuation of pembrolizumab.  
Laboratory findings 
Assessment report  
EMA/617606/2021 
Page 158/170 
 
 
 
 
 
No  new  laboratory  safety  AE  was  identified  in  the  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group.  Laboratory 
abnormalities were mirrored the lenvatinib monotherapy and the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab safety profile, 
however with higher proportions for ALT and AST increased, cholesterol increased, triglycerides increased, 
glucose increased, hypomagnesemia. Most AEs were of Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory 
abnormalities with incidence >=10% were: lymphocyte decreased (16.9%), sodium decreased (14.4%), 
potassium decreased (10.7%).   
Three participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group met the prespecified drug induced liver injury 
criteria. 
Safety profile by intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
Age categories. In KN-775, the safety profile of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab worsened the higher the age 
category considered. Compared to younger age groups (<65 and 65-74 years), the category >75 years of 
age presented the highest proportions of drug-related AEs and frequencies were the following: drug-related 
Grade 3-5 AEs 81.3% and 80% vs 74.6%, drug-related SAEs 33.7% and 42.9% vs 31.2%, drug-related 
discontinuation due to AE 30.1% and 31.1% vs 22.9%. Fatal events and drug-related fatal events were 
highest in the age category >75 years: 17.1% and 5.7% (respectively 3.0 and 0 in 65-75 category, and 
5.9 and 2.0 in age category <65 years). Though limited by the small sample size (n=35), a worse safety 
profile (in particular regarding drug-related AEs) is noted in the older age group (i.e. age >75 years) for 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab, when compared to younger age categories. In the older age group (≥75 years), 
for pembrolizumab an increased toxicity for several AE categories (drug-related grade 3-5 AEs, drug-related 
SAE, death due to AE, discontinuation due to AE) is noted when the drug is administered in combination 
with lenvatinib as compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Gender. As in KN-775 study all participants were females, sub-group analysis based on sex is not considered 
informative for the present submission. 
Ethnicity. Safety evaluation of pembrolizumab+lenvatinib according to ethnicity is limited due to the small 
number of KN-775 study participants who were Asian. As AEs with higher frequency in Asians than in Whites 
were almost all ADR for Lenvatinib; thus, it is agreed that the Keytruda SmPC should not be amended.   
Safety analyses based on ECOG PS and Geographic region did not highlight differences across subgroups. 
MMR status. As for the overall population, within each of MMR status comparison of KN-775 study arms 
showed a worse safety profile in the combination group in respect to TPC. 
In the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab group higher proportions were found in the dMMR group compared to the 
pMMR group  for  the  following:  subjects with  Grade  3-5  AEs  (95.3% vs  87.7%,  respectively),  Grade  3-5 
drug-related AEs (85.9% vs 76.3%), SAEs (68.8% vs 49.7%), drug-related SAEs (45.3% vs 31%), fatal 
event due to an AE (3.1% vs 1.2%), dose modifications due to AEs (100% vs 92.4%), dose interruptions 
due to AEs (71.9% vs 68.7%), and discontinuation due to AEs (43.8% vs 31%). As an approximately three-
times longer duration of exposure to lenvatinib+pembrolizumab is found in the dMMR group in respect to 
the pMMR group, table with exposure-adjusted incidence rates by MMR status and KN-775 study arms was 
requested. Exposure-adjusted rates of AEs and AEOSIs were generally similar or lower in the dMMR group 
compared to the pMMR group, suggesting that the higher AE proportions are due to drug exposure.  
Data received after initial assessment: Fifty-two AEs for 6 clinical study participants enrolled at a single 
study center started prior to the data cutoff for interim analysis 1 (IA1) (data cutoff 26-Oct-2020) of KN775, 
but were not entered into the database at the time of the database lock (20-Nov-2020) that was used to 
support the CSR and eCTD summary modules in the extension of indication submission.  These AEs were 
identified by site monitors and entered retrospectively into the database prior to the next database lock 
performed to provide data for the 90-day Safety Update Report (SUR). This 90-day SUR includes additional 
safety data reported between the IA1 data cutoff of 26-Oct-2020 and the SUR data cutoff of 08-Feb-2021 
Assessment report

(database  lock  on  22-Mar-2021),  representing  an  additional  3.5  months  of  safety  data  from  Study 
309/KEYNOTE-775 (SUR not submitted). 
The main contributing factors for this GCP deviation were incomplete documentation with subsequent late 
entry of safety data by the site and insufficient oversight by the Principal Investigator (enhanced by the 
COVID-19 pandemic). Corrective / preventive actions have been implemented. 
None of these AEs were fatal AEs or SAEs. Out of these 52 AEs, there were: 
-  31 AEs in 2 subjects in the combination group: mainly grade 1 or 2, with 1 Grade 3 hypertension 
and 1 Grade 4 lipase elevation, both assessed per investigator as related to Lenvatinib.  
-  21 AEs in 4 subjects in the chemotherapy group: mainly grade 1 or 2,  with 1 Grade 3 vomiting 
related to doxorubicin. 
No new safety signals were identified and safety was consistent with that reported in the initial CSR. These 
additional 52 AEs are not impacting the previous benefit/risk assessment (+0.34% in the combination arm 
vs  +0.46%  in  the  TPC  arm),  and  the  additional  3.5  months  data  (after  IA1)  will  be  submitted  after 
marketing authorisation during the pharmacovigilance follow-up.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab combination for treatment of advanced EC in patients who 
have  disease  progression  following  prior  platinum-based  systemic  therapy  in  any  setting  and  are  not 
candidates  for  curative  surgery  or  radiation  was  not  substantially  different  from  that  of  standard 
chemotherapy  based  on  physician’s  choice,  although  with  different  types  of  AEs  as  expected  from  the 
different class of drugs.  
The apparent worse safety profile of Lenvatinib+pembrolizumab for most AEs and drug-related AEs was 
partially reverted at exposure-adjusted incidence analysis showing slightly lower rates with the treatment 
of  interest  as  compared  to  chemotherapy,  while  SAEs  and  deaths  did  not  differ  between  groups.  Dose 
interruptions  and  treatment  discontinuations  (mostly  related  to  lenvatinib)  occurred  however  more 
frequently in the lenvatinib+pembrolizumab arm than in controls, also when adjusted for exposure. 
Well-known  safety  concerns  associated  with  lenvatinib  (CSAEs)  and  with  pembrolizumab  (AEOSIs) 
(especially  the  latter)  were  more  common  with  the  combination  treatment  than  with  the  single-drug 
regimens, which is in line with the safety pattern found for non-EC indications of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab 
treatment.  Most  of  these  AEs  presented  with  the  expected  severity  and  were  managed  following 
consolidated indications.  
No new safety concerns were identified. 
Overall,  IV  pembrolizumab  200  mg  Q3W  in  combination  with  oral  lenvatinib  20  mg  QD  showed  a 
manageable safety profile in the advanced endometrial carcinoma population that is generally consistent 
with the established safety profiles of the individual pembrolizumab and lenvatinib monotherapies, and the 
safety profile of the combination in non-EC.

•  KEYTRUDA,  in  combination  with  lenvatinib,  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  endometrial 
carcinoma in adults who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and 
who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation (see section 5.1) 
During the procedure, the indication was updated as follows:  
•  KEYTRUDA,  in  combination  with  lenvatinib,  is  indicated  for the  treatment of  advanced  or recurrent 
endometrial carcinoma in adults who have disease progression on or following prior treatment with 
a  platinum-containing  systemic  therapy  in  any  setting  and  who  are  not  candidates  for  curative 
surgery or radiation (see section 5.1). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide22 and the most common 
gynaecological cancer in developed countries, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years. Adenocarcinoma 
of the endometrium is typically divided in type I (70-80%) which include the less aggressive endometrioid 
histology,  and  type  II  (20-30%)  comprising  non-endometrioid  histologies,  having  poorer  prognosis 23. 
Microsatellite  unstable  tumours  (MSI-H)  is  one  of  the  four  clinically  significant  molecular  subtypes  of 
endometrial cancer with different clinical prognoses24.  
Most of endometrial cancer patients are diagnosed when disease is localized, and the prognosis for EC is 
significantly influenced by disease stage. Patients with regional and distant metastatic disease have 5-year 
survival  rates  of  69%  and  16.8%,  respectively 25 .  Approximately  20%  of  EC  cases  recur  with  poor 
prognosis26. In general, the median survival of patients with recurrent or advanced disease is 12 months27.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently,  the  mainstay  of  treatment  of  EC  is  surgery  with  hysterectomy  and  bilateral  salpingo-
oophorectomy; based on the risk stratification, adjuvant treatment radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are 
used28. Hormonal therapy can be used as systemic treatment for front-line hormone receptor-positive grade 
1 or 2 tumours in the absence of rapidly progressive disease37. Endometrial cancer is a relatively chemo-
sensitive  disease,  with  anthracyclines,  platinum-based  drugs  and  taxanes  shown  to  be  the  most  active 
agents.  For  patients  with  advanced  disease  not  amenable  to  radical  treatment,  according  to  ESMO 
guidelines,  the  standard  of  care  is  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  as  first  line  treatment37.  Cytotoxic 
chemotherapy as second-line treatment after platinum-containing therapy is supported by limited evidence,

especially with treatment-free interval following first-line chemotherapy <6–12 months, and it is generally 
associated with low response rates (≤ 15%), limited PFS (4 months), and toxicity29. 
In the EU, the anti-PD1 antibody Jemperli (dostarlimab) has been approved in 2021 for the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  mismatch  repair  deficient  (dMMR)/microsatellite  instability-high  (MSI-H)  recurrent  or 
advanced  endometrial  cancer  (EC)  that has  progressed  on  or  following  prior  treatment  with  a platinum-
containing regimen.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 is a multicenter, open-label, randomized 1:1, Phase 3 trial to compare the efficacy 
and safety of Lenvatinib in combination with Pembrolizumab vs treatment of physician’s choice (paclitaxel 
or  doxorubicin)  in  participants  with  advanced  endometrial  cancer  (EC)  progressed  after  prior  platinum-
based therapy. The results of the Interim Analysis 1 (i.e. final for PFS, interim for OS) with data cut-off 
date 26 Oct 2020 have been submitted. The median duration of follow up in the overall population is 11.4 
months (range 0.3, 26.9). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Study  309/KEYNOTE-755  showed  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  PFS  benefit  of 
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib  vs  standard  chemotherapy  in  all  comers  (HR  0.56,  95%CI  0.47,  0.66, 
p>0.0001  one-sided,  median  PFS  7.2  vs  3.8  months)  and  in  pMMR  primary  populations  (HR  0.60, 
95%CI 0.50, 0.72, p<0.0001 one-sided, median PFS 6.6 vs 3.8 months) at the final PFS analysis. 
•  A statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit of pembrolizumab+lenvatinib vs chemotherapy 
was shown in OS in all comers (HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.51, 0.75, p<0.0001 one-sided, median OS 18.3 vs 
11.4 months) and in pMMR (HR 0.68, 95%CI 0.56, 0.84, p=0.0001 one-sided, median OS from 17.4 
vs 12 month) at the interim OS analysis, with about 50% of patients with a death event. OS curves 
overlap up to month 3 and remained consistently separated throughout the duration of the evaluation 
period.  
•  ORR improvement was seen in all comers [31.9% (27.4, 36.6), vs 14.7% (11.4, 18.4)] as well as in 
pMMR  population  [30.3%  (25.5,  35.5)  vs  15.1%  (11.5,  19.3)].  CR  rates  was  also  higher  for  the 
combination.  
• 
In  the  all  comers,  the  median  DOR  was  longer  in  the  experimental  arm  (14.4  vs  5.7  months),  with 
higher number of durable responses (71.9% vs 42.6% of responding subjects for ≥6 months). Same 
trend was observed in pMMR subgroup (median DOR 9.2 vs 5.7 months, durable responses lasting ≥6 
months 65.6% vs 42.1%). 
•  Consistent treatment effect across all main subgroups analysed.

• 
The benefit of the combination is also observed in the smaller dMMR subgroup (not formally tested), 
where efficacy of the combination appears higher compared to what observed in the pMMR population 
(PFS HR 0.36, OS HR 0.37, ORR 40% vs 12.3%, CR 13.8% vs 3.1%, median DOR NR vs 4.1 months).   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
The population of Study 309/ KEYNOTE-775 possibly reflects a fitter subgroup of subjects with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma in terms of ECOG and comorbidities, and it might not be fully 
representative of an endometrial cancer population with generally dismal prognosis. The exclusion of 
patients with ECOG ≥2  from clinical studies is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC and also reflected in 
the description of Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 study in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
• 
Lack of direct comparison of the combination with each monotherapy, especially with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy relative to the dMMR subgroup. Results by MMR subgroup have been 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Data on indirect comparison in the dMMR population are reflected in 
this assessment report. 
• 
No data on PD-L1 status have been collected in Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 and consequently no 
subgroup analyses by PD-L1 expression have been conducted. 
• 
OS data is not fully mature yet and this limits the efficacy estimation at this moment. The MAH is 
recommended  to  submit  the  results  from  the  final  OS  analysis  in  the  overall  population  and  by  MMR 
biomarker by Q4 2022. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  Compared to standard chemotherapy, lenvatinib+pembrolizumab displayed a worse safety profile, as 
shown by higher proportions of subjects with drug-related AEs (97.3% versus 93.8%, respectively), 
Grade 3-5 drug-related AEs (77.8% versus 59%), drug-related SAEs (33.3% versus 14.2%), who had 
dose interruption of any drug due to an AE (69.2% versus 27.1%) or who discontinued any drug due 
to an AE (33% versus 8%). Proportions of fatal events and drug-related fatal events were comparable 
across study arms.  
•  When evaluating exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 100 person-months, a partially reversed safety 
picture is found: AEs 232 versus 256, drug-related AEs 133 vs 153, Grade 3-5 AEs 31.02 vs 48.78, 
drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs 18.52 versus 34.5. For SAEs (10.15 and 10.08 per 100 person-months in 
the combination arm and controls, respectively), drug-related SAEs (5.15 and 4.08), deaths (0.59 and 
1.08), and deaths due to drug-related AE (0.15 and 0.45) the incidence rate of events was comparable 
across study arms. However, the proportion of subjects with dose modification (37.9 versus 18.6 per 
100 person-months), dose interruption (21.18 versus 11.5), dose reduction (15.16 versus 4.76), and 
discontinuation due to AE (5 versus 2.32), to a drug-related AEs (3.98 versus 1.76), to a SAEs (2.42 
versus 0.85), or to a drug-related SAEs (1.63 versus 0.45) all remained higher in the study group of 
interest.

• 
• 
• 
The  most  common  AEs  in  the  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  were:  hypertension  (64%), 
hypothyroidism (57.4%), diarrhoea (54.2%), nausea (49.5%), decreased appetite (44.8%), vomiting 
(36.7%), weight decreased (34%), fatigue (33%), arthralgia (30.5%).  
The well-known safety concerns associated with pembrolizumab (AEOSIs) were reported in 67.2% of 
KN-775 combination arm participants, and in 25.1% pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD subjects. Most 
often reported AEOSIs were hypothyroidism (57.6%), hyperthyroidism (11.6%), and colitis (4.7%).  
The  frequency  and  severity  of  CSAEs  in  the  KN-775  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  group  was  generally 
consistent  with  those  found  in  the  non-EC  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  group  and  the  lenvatinib 
monotherapy SD, with the exception of the CSAEs of hepatotoxicity (33.7% versus 17.5% and 19.6%, 
respectively),  hypothyroidism  (68.2%  versus  19.8%  and  43.5%),  and  renal  events  (18.2%  versus 
10.0% and 18.7%). Most CSAEs resolved, and only few resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  More  participants  in  the  ≥75  years  of  age  group  experienced  drug-related  SAEs,  deaths,  and 
discontinuation of lenvatinib compared to the other age categories (which was similar to the lenvatinib 
plus  pembrolizumab  non-EC  group  and  lenvatinib  monotherapy  group).  However,  conclusions  are 
limited due to the small number of participants in the ≥75 years of age group (i.e. 35 in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab EC group in Study 309/KN775).

Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 study showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantage in OS 
and  PFS  of  the  combination  pembrolizumab  +  lenvatinib  as  compared  to  standard  chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin  or  paclitaxel,  TPC)  in  the  setting  with  dismal  prognosis  of  advanced  endometrial  cancer 
patients progressed to at least one prior platinum-based therapy not amenable for curative treatment. ORR 
for  the  combination  was  not  outstanding  but  was  doubled  compared  to  the  standard  treatment.  These 
results  were  however  obtained  in  a  trial  population  apparently  more  fit  and  with  less  comorbidities 
compared to the target population, restricted to patients with ECOG 0-1. The benefit of the combination 
over  TPC  was  shown  in  the  all  comers  as  well  as  in  the  pMMR  population  (populations  for  the  primary 
analyses),  and  was  evident  also  in  the  dMMR  subgroup.  However,  the  design  of  the  study  lacking 
monotherapy  arms  hampers  the  assessment  of  the contribution of  each  component  to  the  combination, 
which has been supported with indirect comparison with pembrolizumab and lenvatinib single arm trials. 
Based on indirect comparison, it is suggested that both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib, each having a limited 
activity in this setting separately, are contributing to the treatment effect in the combination regimen in 
pMMR EC population. On the contrary, in the dMMR subgroup the activity of the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
does not appear significantly different as compared to pembrolizumab alone, while lenvatinib add toxicity. 
The lack of direct comparison and limitations of cross trial comparison, the limited number of patients and 
wider  confidence  intervals  in  the  dMMR  population,  added  to  some  baseline  differences  in  populations 
enrolled  in  the  studies  provided  for  the  indirect  comparison,  preclude  however  definitive  conclusions. 
Overall, the combination appears not particularly well tolerated, with higher rate of discontinuations due to 
adverse  event  compared  to  the  chemotherapy  arm.  The  safety  profile  of  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  is 
different  compared  to  chemotherapy,  as  expected,  and  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  both 
drugs, with no new safety concern identified. In elderly individuals, for pembrolizumab an increased toxicity 
for several AE categories (drug-related grade 3-5 AEs, drug-related SAE, death due to AE, discontinuation 
due  to  AE)  is  noted  when  the  drug  is  administered  in  combination  with  lenvatinib  as  compared  to 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  pembrolizumab  represents  an  effective  treatment  option  for  the 
population of patients with second line recurrent or advanced EC as compared to standard chemotherapy. 
A  clinical  benefit  of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  pembrolizumab  was  shown  over  the  chemotherapy 
options 
for  participants  with  advanced  EC 
in  the  overall  population.  The  safety  profile  of 
lenvatinib+pembrolizumab is different compared to chemotherapy, as expected, and consistent with the 
known safety profile of both drugs and the safety profile of the combination in non-EC, with no new safety 
concern identified, although the combination overall appears not to be particularly well tolerated. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda in combination with lenvatinib in advanced or recurrent EC after treatment with 
platinum-based therapy is positive.  
The following measure is considered necessary to address issues to address issues related to efficacy:

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib for the treatment of 
advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma in adults who have disease progression on or following 
prior treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and who are not candidates for curative 
surgery or radiation; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 33.0 of the RMP has also been agreed.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

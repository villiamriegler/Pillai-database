2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is an inherited multi-organ disease of variable severity with its first 
description in the year 1969 by the French hepatologist Daniel Alagille. ALGS is an autosomal dominant 
disease with variable expressivity, caused by heterozygous mutations in either JAG1 or NOTCH2. The 
vast majority of cases are due to JAG1 mutations accounting for 94%, and NOTCH2 mutations in 
additional 2-4%. Sixty percent of patients harbour de novo mutations (i.e., sporadic). The remaining 
40% inherit their mutation from a typically mildly affected parent. The Notch pathway is involved in 
cell fate determination and plays a crucial role in normal development, and the JAG1 is highly 
expressed in organs that are typically affected in patients with ALGS. 
The proposed treatment is aimed at one of the most prominent features of the disease which is 
cholestasis caused by paucity of biliary ducts, and which itself manifests as cholestasis with scleral 
icterus, conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, and potentially hepatomegaly. The increased level of bile 
acids in the serum usually causes severe pruritus.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
ALGS is a rare disease. The prevalence of ALGS is estimated to be 1 in 70,000 (estimation vary from 
1:30000 to 1:100000). Chronic obstructive cholestasis is present in 75% to 100% of patients with 
ALGS (Kamath et al. 2018). 
In most cases, the liver dysfunction in ALGS is the earliest and more serious feature of this genetic 
condition, characterised by severe chronic intrahepatic cholestasis that often develops in the first 3 
months of life.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
In ALGS, Notch signalling impairment due to JAGGED1 or NOTCH2 mutations may affect the 
development of intrahepatic bile ducts leading to bile duct paucity and cholestasis (Kamath et al. 2003; 
Kamath et al. 2012).  In this condition, bile ducts are abnormally narrow, malformed, and reduced in 
number, which leads to retention of toxic bile acids in the liver and elevated serum bile acids (sBAs), 
that are associated with pruritus, the most burdensome symptom in ALGS (Kamath et al. 2018). In 
addition, high bile acid levels in the liver lead to a decrease in the cholesterol conversion to bile acid 
resulting in elevations in systemic cholesterol levels (Nemes 2016). Excess of cholesterol can lead to a 
build-up of cholesterol under the surface of the skin, known as xanthomas. Cholestasis typically also 
presents with growth impairment and chronic fatigue.  
The cholestatic liver disease in ALGS, even in the absence of liver cirrhosis include severe and 
unremitting pruritus, xanthomas (disfiguring and sometimes disabling subcutaneous lipid deposits, 
chronic fatigue and growth failure (although this could also be related to the cardiac disease 
manifestations). In addition, fat-soluble vitamin (FSV) malabsorption and increased risk of bone 
fractures due to trabeculae malformation can also be present as a direct consequence of the bile-duct 
related disease manifestation. Collectively, all cholestasis-related symptoms result in poor HRQoL. In 
this regard, the cholestasis-related pruritus of ALGS is thought to be among the most severe of all liver 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 11/123 
 
 
 
diseases, resulting in cutaneous mutilation and disrupted sleep and school activities. Children with 
cholestasis and ALGS often also have disfiguring xanthomas. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and prognosis 
The diagnosis of ALGS is usually made early in life due to either hepatic/bile-duct or heart-related 
manifestations of the disease, finally by genetic testing.  
The seven main features of the disease are thought to be cardiac defects (more than 90% of the 
patients, with pulmonary artery stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, septal defects, aortic stenosis and 
coarctation), the hepatic manifestations (almost 100%; characterised with cholestasis, 
hyperbilirubinaemia, pruritus, xanthomas, and finally end-stage liver disease), renal abnormalities 
(about 40%, renal dysplasia, glomerular mesangiolipidosis, renal tubular acidosis), skeletal 
abnormalities (30-90%; butterfly vertebrae, hemivertebrae, pathological fractures of long bones), 
ophthalmologic manifestations (above 80%, posterior embryotoxon), dysmorphic facies (prominent, 
broad forehead, deep-set eyes with hypertelorism, prominent ears, triangular face, broad nasal 
bridge), and finally vascular abnormalities (>15). 
Further features also include short stature, failure to thrive, developmental delay and 
immunodeficiency. 
Key features associated with cholestasis in ALGS are: 
1.  Severe and unremitting cholestatic pruritus (80% at 2 years of age) that is among the most severe 
of all liver diseases and results in cutaneous mutilation and disrupted sleep and school activities 
(Kamath et al. 2015; Kamath et al. 2018) 
2.  Hypercholesterolaemia (81% - 83% in ALGS patients with cholestasis; Kamath et al. 2018) 
3.  Xanthomas (between 30% and 42%), that can be disfiguring and/or disabling (Kamath et al. 2018) 
4.  Chronic fatigue (between 65% and 85% in cholestatic patients in general, though specific 
prevalence data in ALGS is lacking; Swain 2006) 
5.  Growth failure (between 50% and 87% in ALGS patients; Kamath et al. 2018) 
6.  Significantly diminished quality of life (HRQoL) (Kamath et al. 2018).  
Notably, there are likely multiple potential contributing factors to poor growth and fatigue, such as 
malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (FSV) and lipids (as a result of poor bile flow), growth hormone 
insensitivity, impaired ability of the liver to metabolise nutrients in the setting of bile flow 
abnormalities, and hepatic inflammation (Bucuvalas 1993; Wasserman 1999; Rovner 2002; Kamath 
2020). 
Fat-soluble vitamin (FSV) malabsorption and increased risk of bone fractures due to trabeculae 
malformation can also be present as a direct consequence of the bile-duct related disease 
manifestation. Elevated bilirubin and liver function parameters are typical manifestations of ALGS. 
Bilirubin (particularly, direct/conjugated) is one of the key components of cholestasis. Increased liver 
function parameters are the indicators of liver damage, that takes place due to accumulation of toxic 
bile acids.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There are no pharmacological therapies approved to treat cholestasis in ALGS. Off label oral 
treatments used in children with ALGS with cholestasis are described in Table 2. In general, the clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 12/123 
 
 
 
burden of cholestasis in ALGS is so severe that even in the absence of end-stage liver disease, it is a 
leading indication for liver transplantation (Lykavieris et al. 2001; Englert et al. 2006; Kamath et al.

The majority of patients receive a liver transplant by adulthood (Kamath et al. 2020; Vandriel et al. 
2020) and more than half of these transplantations is for persistent pruritus (Vandriel et al., in press). 
Importantly, the clinical burden of cholestasis, including pruritus, outweighs reasons for transplantation 
of cirrhosis and manifestations of portal hypertension (see Table below).

Given the lack of approved pharmacotherapy for cholestatic pruritus, the invasive nature of surgical 
treatment options, and patients’ short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, there remains a high 
unmet medical need for pharmacological treatment that is safe and efficacious in easing disease 
burden. 
2.2.  About the product 
Mode  of  action:  Maralixibat  chloride  (formerly  known  as  SD-5613,  SHP625,  and  LUM001;  hereafter 
referred to as maralixibat) is an inhibitor of the ASBT.  
This transmembrane protein transporter, localised on the luminal surface of ileal enterocytes, is present 
in the terminal 25% of the small intestine and mediates uptake of conjugated bile acids across the brush 
border membrane of the enterocyte.  
Maralixibat is a potent, highly selective ASBT inhibitor (IC50 = 0.3 nM) as demonstrated in cell-based 
assays. Maralixibat is minimally absorbed due to its large molecular weight (710 Da) and the presence 
of  a  positively  charged  quaternary  nitrogen  atom,  therefore  maximizing  the  local  exposure  of  the 
molecule to its target and minimizing unnecessary systemic exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 14/123 
 
 
 
 
Maralixibat-mediated  blockade  of  intestinal  reabsorption  of  bile  acids  by  ASBT  interrupts  the 
enterohepatic  circulation, thereby  increasing  fBA  excretion  and  lowering  sBA  levels  (see  the  following 
figure). 
ASBT = apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter. 
Figure 1 Interruption of Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile Acids by Maralixibat 
The proposed commercial formulation is an oral solution that will be measured for dosing on a weight 
basis and be taken once or twice daily. It is supplied as a 9.5 mg/mL ready-to-use fixed concentration 
of maralixibat free base solution (equivalent to 10 mg/mL maralixibat chloride).  
The proposed dosing regimen is a starting dose of 190 μg/kg maralixibat (free base) once daily and 
should be increased to 380 μg/kg maralixibat once daily after one week. 
The initially targeted indication was “treatment of cholestatic liver disease in patients with Alagille 
syndrome (ALGS) 1 year of age and older”. Later during the procedure, the indication was adapted to 
treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
Maralixibat was originally developed for the treatment of cholestatic diseases by Lumena 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Shire Human Genetic Therapies, Inc. Ownership of the maralixibat development 
programme was transferred to Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in December 2018. Maralixibat was 
previously studied in healthy volunteers as well as adults and adolescents with elevated cholesterol, 
and adults with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). Indications 
of hypercholesterolaemia, PSC and PBC are no longer being pursued.

ALGS = Alagille syndrome; BA = biliary atresia; IND = Investigational New Drug; PBC = primary 
biliary cholangitis; PFIC = progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis; PSC = primary sclerosing 
cholangitis. 
The applicant is currently developing maralixibat for the treatment of ALGS, PFIC, and biliary atresia.  
Due to its key role in bile acid intestinal re-uptake, the ASBT is considered an adequate target for 
pharmacological interruption of bile acid enterohepatic circulation, especially considering, that ASBT is 
upregulated in patients with cholestasis. By blocking ASBT, maralixibat reduces systemic uptake of bile 
acids and improves cholestatic pruritus. 
The maralixibat clinical development programme in children with cholestatic liver diseases includes 5 
completed studies in participants with ALGS (LUM001-301, -302, -303, -304, and -305), 3 studies in 
participants with PFIC (LUM001-501 [completed], MRX-502, and MRX-503), a long-term study that 
includes participants with ALGS and PFIC who had completed previous maralixibat studies (MRX-800), 
and an infant study for participants with ALGS and PFIC younger than 1 year of age (MRX-801). In 
addition, 1 study (MRX-701) in participants with biliary atresia was initiated. 
For the proposed indication there is currently no regulatory guidance document available. 
The quality development programme of maralixibat was discussed at a Protocol Assistance meeting 
which the applicant applied for in June 2019. 
A final advice letter was submitted to the applicant October 2019. 
The following issues, were discussed: 
- 
Issues related to starting materials for the synthesis of the drug substance, one of which was 
not agreed with. 
- 
Issues related to the proposed specifications for drug substance, drug product and the grape 
flavour excipient, which were generally considered acceptable. Some conditions were given for the 
acceptability of especially the drug product. 
The clinical development for the product was discussed in an advice which was applied for in March 
2019. At that time the targeted indication was “treatment of Alagille Syndrome”. A Scientific Advice 
oral hearing took place in June 2019, and the final advice letter was adopted by CHMP in the same 
month. The following issues were discussed: 
- 
The proposal of the applicant to conduct study MRX-308 post-authorisation in order to confirm 
a clinically relevant effect of maralixibat in ALGS. This approach was considered critical at the time, 
due to the fact that other studies had not shown significant improvements in itch scores, and the 
randomised withdrawal design as pivotal evidence was considered to be problematic. Given these 
caveats, it was strongly advised to both redesign and complete study 308 prior to submission of the 
MAA. Advice was given to conduct a conventional placebo-controlled trial with an at least 12 week 
duration. 
- 
Agreement with the proposed study design of study MRX-308. The answer is, in principle 
included in the above. The intention of the applicant at that time was, to initiate study MRX-308 in Q4-
2019. Study MRX-308 was proposed as a 30-week study, including a 6-week randomised, double-blind 
treatment withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maralixibat in paediatric subjects 
with ALGS (≥12 months and <18 years of age). The main reason for not accepting the design of the 
trial was related to the assumption that effects after a withdrawal of a compound (when all patients 
have “adjusted” to its effects already), must be regarded differently from evaluating the effects of a 
compound that is newly introduced (which more closely resembles what will happen in clinical 
practice).

EMA/864249/2022 
Page 16/123 
 
 
 
Since the 13 June 2019 meeting, new evidence has prompted the applicant to seek full approval in the 
first instance and the applicant has submitted an application for the indication “treatment of cholestatic 
liver disease in patients with ALGS 1 year of age and older” without mentioning the conduct of study 
MRX-308. The conduct of study MRX-308 has obviously been abandoned. The reasons for this decision 
is given as follows by the applicant: 
First, 2 large population-based studies have been published, shedding a new light on the natural 
history of ALGS (Kamath et al. 2020; Vandriel et al. 2020). These studies demonstrated the 
progressive and deleterious liver involvement in ALGS. Most patients with ALGS either die or undergo 
liver transplantation in the first 2 decades of life.  
Second, the applicant has obtained longer follow-up data from Studies LUM001-304 and LUM001-303 
and new long-term data from Study LUM001-305, which are provided in this MAA , along with a new 
natural history comparison where 84 maralixibat-treated patients with ALGS are compared with 
patients from the GALA clinical research database. The long-term studies have shown consistent and 
durable clinical improvements as well as a positive impact on long-term EFS when compared with a 
natural-history cohort. 
The applicant has also had a pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur in May 
2021, during which the following aspects were discussed: 
- 
The suitability of the database proposed for submission and for assessment, which was in 
principle confirmed. 
- 
The problems mentioned with the assessment of withdrawal effects (as compared to de-novo 
treatment comparisons), similar to the concern raised in the Scientific Advice procedure. 
- 
Comparability of the GALA population to the study population within the development 
programme was considered to be of utmost importance 
- 
Justification of the proposed dose and dosing schedule. 
During the procedure the initially targeted indication “treatment of cholestatic liver disease in patients 
with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 1 year of age and older” was adapted to “treatment of cholestasis in 
patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older” and then further modified to 
“treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older” 
(the finally approved indication). 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the inherent weaknesses 
identified to be present within the development programme, and the conclusion that it was therefore 
unclear whether the unmet medical need can be met, and the public interest/need to correctly 
conclude on efficacy and/or positive benefit risk was rated higher than the possibility for early 
approval. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as oral solution containing 9.5 mg/mL of maralixibat (as maralixibat 
chloride).  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 17/123 
 
 
 
 
Other ingredients are: propylene glycol (E1520), disodium edetate, sucralose, grape flavour and 
purified water. 
The product is available in an amber-coloured PET bottle with a preinstalled LDPE adapter and a HDPE 
child-resistant closure with a foam liner as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of maralixibat chloride is 1-[[4-[[4-[(4R,5R)-3,3-dibutyl-7-(dimethylamino)-
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-1,1-dioxido-1-benzothiepin-5-yl]phenoxy]methyl]phenyl]methyl]-4-aza-
1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium, chloride corresponding to the molecular formula C40H56ClN3O4S. It has 
a relative molecular mass of 710.42 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 2 Active Substance Structure 
The chemical structure of maralixibat chloride was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry, 
1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectrometry, Fourier-transform 
infrared spectroscopy, specific optical rotation and elemental analysis. The solid-state properties of the 
active substance were determined by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-
ray powder diffraction and dynamic vapor sorption analysis. The absolute stereochemistry of 
maralixibat was assigned based on single crystal X-ray data. 
The active substance is a white to light yellow, slightly hygroscopic solid which is soluble in water, 
methanol and propylene glycol. The solubility of maralixibat chloride is low in some organic solvents 
(acetonitrile, acetone) and in others the active substance is insoluble (tetrahydrofuran, toluene, 
heptane). Maralixibat chloride is a Class III compound according to the Biopharmaceutical 
Classification System with high solubility and low permeability. 
Maralixibat chloride exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. It is a single 
stereoisomer in the R, R-configuration. The desired stereoisomer is stable during manufacture of the 
active substance. Currently, the two chiral centres originate from a starting material, but the applicant 
has committed to redefine the starting material (see more detailed discussion in the next chapter). The 
chiral purity is controlled by chiral HPLC in the starting material specification and is also routinely 
controlled in the active substance specification. 
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. The active substance manufactured is the 
thermodynamically stable polymorphic form.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the dossier 
and it was considered satisfactory. The active substance is obtained from a single manufacturer. 
Starting from the initially proposed starting material, maralixibat chloride is synthesised in three main 
steps. 
During the procedure, a Major Objection was raised on the designation of a starting material. The 
designation of this complex chiral molecule as active substance starting material was not considered in 
line with regulatory requirements. The applicant has already initiated work to establish the active 
substance manufacturing process at an additional manufacturing site beginning with the introduction of 
a new starting material. The manufacturing process to the new intermediate is adequately described in 
the dossier. The re-designed starting material is acceptable. 
In order not to delay patients’ access to this orphan medicinal product with unmet medical need for a 
severe disease and based on the data available from batches from the new (additional) manufacturer 
and the comparability with batch data from the current process, it has been agreed that the applicant 
will introduce the additional manufacturer and all the relevant data related the new starting material 
by submission of a variation no later than December 2023 (see recommendations). 
The two other starting materials used in the manufacture of the active substance are well-defined with 
acceptable specifications. Following a question from the CHMP, the applicant has agreed to strengthen 
the control strategy for a solvent used (see recommendations). 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Following a question 
from the CHMP, the applicant has agreed to improve the specification for the solvent mixture used for 
washing of one of the intermediates by developing a test method for assay and potential impurities 
testing (see recommendations).  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified.  
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene bags placed within a high-density 
polyethylene container. The primary packaging complies with Regulation EC 10/2011 as amended. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), polymorphic 
form (XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, GC-MS), chiral purity (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
chloride identity (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC HS) and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed active substance specifications limits, tests, and methods are acceptable. Acceptance 
criteria have been established and justified in accordance with guideline ICH Q6A. The acceptance 
criteria of stated impurities have been justified based on general ICH thresholds. Impurities present at 
higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by non-clinical studies. All 
necessary tests have been included in the specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 19/123 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay, chiral purity and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 6 batches of the active substance manufactured at commercial scale are 
provided. Additionally, batch analysis data from stability and relevant clinical and toxicological batches 
are provided. The results are within the specifications applied at the time of testing and show that 
process improvements have led to lower levels of impurities in the active substance. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from five batches of active substance manufactured at pilot scale (≥ 1/10) or larger 
relative to the commercial scale have been presented. Two batches of active substance were 
manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturer, while three batches were manufactured at a 
different manufacturer used during development. The batches were stored in a container closure 
system representative of that intended for the market for up to 18 months under long term conditions 
(25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines. In addition, data from 7 supportive stability batches of active used in toxicology 
and clinical studies and manufactured at a different manufacturer used during development was 
provided for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (4 ºC / 75% RH). The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. No significant trends were observed, and all tested parameters 
were within the specifications. The comparison of the stability results for assay, impurities, and water 
content shows no difference between the two primary stability batches manufactured at the site 
proposed for commercial manufacture and the primary and supportive stability batches manufactured 
at the previous manufacturer. Parameters not tested have been appropriately justified by stability 
data.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The active 
substance in the solid state was found to be relatively stable when exposed to light. In solution, minor 
degradation was observed. 
Stress test studies were conducted with the solid active substance and in solution. Samples were 
exposed to acidic, basic, oxidative, dry heat and heat/humidity stress conditions. Minor degradation 
was observed under basic conditions in solution. Under acidic and oxidative conditions, the active 
substance was found to be unstable.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored at 
controlled room temperature with excursions permitted between 15°C – 30°C and with the storage 
condition ‘Store in the original package in order to protect from light’. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Livmarli 9.5 mg/mL oral solution presents as 30 mL of clear, colourless to light-yellow solution 
formulation filled into a 30 mL amber coloured PET bottle with a preinstalled LDPE adapter and a HDPE 
child-resistant closure with a foam liner. 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 20/123 
 
 
 
The oral solution is recommended to be administered using a repeated-use dosing dispenser for oral 
use. Three sizes of CE marked oral syringes (0.5 mL, 1 mL and 3 mL) are co-packaged in the 
secondary container closure system. 
The aim of formulation development was to develop a liquid formulation for paediatric patients which 
provided for ease of dosing, patient acceptability and flexibility of dosing allowing weight-based dosing 
over a broad range of patient weights. Definition of the quality target product profile (QTPP, Table 6) 
allowed identification of potential critical quality attributes (CQAs: identity, assay, degradation 
products, propylene assay, disodium edetate dihydrate assay and microbial enumeration/tests for 
specified microorganisms) which were then investigated during development studies, although not in 
detail, which is acceptable for an aqueous solution using an active substance with high solubility.

Target 
Justification 
Alternative Route of 
None 
The drug target (ASBT) lies on the apical side 
Administration 
of the intestinal surface. The compound is 
minimally absorbed. Therefore, the oral route 
is the most appropriate route for drug 
administration. 
The choice of route of administration, dosage form and dosing needs/flexibility as well as the 
excipients used in the formulation and the administration devices have been adequately discussed. 
The thermodynamically stable form of the active substance is used. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
with the exception of the grape flavour. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this 
report. Propylene glycol (E1520) is an excipient with a known physiological effect and is thus also listed 
in section 2 of the SmPC.  
The commercial finished product formulation is a fixed active substance concentration with variable 
administered volumes to achieve the desired weight-based dosing. Different strengths of active 
substance were investigated, and minor adjustments were made to the composition compared to the 
fixed-dose volume formulation. In addition to acting as a solvent, propylene glycol also serves a 
preservative. In this regard an antimicrobial effectiveness test to evaluate the ability of the solution to 
withstand microbial contamination during use showed that the Ph. Eur. requirements (5.1.3) were only 
met with propylene glycol. Development of a propylene glycol-free formulation was explored however 
a stable formulation free of propylene glycol is not readily available for commercial manufacturing. 
Although the excipients are considered safe for children at the levels used in the formulation, as this 
product is indicated for chronic use in paediatric patients suffering from a liver disease, the CHMP 
recommends continuation of development towards a propylene glycol-free formulation (see 
recommendations). To ensure stability, sodium edetate dihydrate was added to formulation as 
antioxidant. 
The development of the manufacturing process has been adequately described.  
The changes made to the formulation during clinical studies are not expected to have an impact on the 
bioequivalence as the finished product is an aqueous solution with an active ingredient that is highly 
soluble in water. 
The maximum acceptable holding time for the bulk solution was established based on a bulk hold time 
study. 
As the product is administered with an oral syringe, physical characteristics of the liquid formulation 
(pH, density, viscosity) were studied at different temperatures (5°C to 30°C). While viscosity decreases 
at lower temperatures, the viscosity of the solution remained low within the studied range ensuring 
that the solution can be drawn from the bottle consistently and without difficulty. 
A deliverable volume study has been conducted to determine the target fill volume in the bottle.  
Extractable and leachable studies were performed with the container closure system and results were 
presented. The container closure system is suitable. 
Qualification studies were performed to support the use of the oral syringes for oral administration. 
These studies include delivered volume accuracy, rinse studies to support reuse, compatibility with the 
oral solution, and extractables and leachables assessments. The studies demonstrated that the syringes 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022

are suitable for the intended use. Livmarli is administered up to 30 minutes before or with a meal. 
Mixing Livmarli directly info food or drink prior to administration has not been studied during 
formulation development and should therefore be avoided as stated in the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is an amber-coloured PET bottle with a preinstalled LDPE adapter and a HDPE 
child-resistant closure with a foam liner. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for Livmarli consists of three main steps: compounding, primary packaging 
(solution filling and capping of bottles) and labelling/secondary packaging. The process is considered to 
be a standard manufacturing process. 
Critical process steps have been presented in tabular format in the dossier together with the respective 
critical process parameters and the applied in process controls. No intermediates are isolated during 
the finished product manufacture.  
The applicant proposes concurrent validation of the finished product manufacturing process as 
described in Annex 15 of the EU GMP guidelines. Based on the knowledge gained through development 
and batch history, the risk of concurrent validation from a quality viewpoint is low and the approach is 
therefore acceptable. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications shown in include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: description, identity (HPLC, UV), active substance assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
propylene glycol assay (HPLC), disodium edetate assay (HPLC), uniformity of mass delivered doses 
from multidose container (Ph. Eur.), deliverable volume (USP), pH (Ph. Eur.), microbial enumeration 
(Ph. Eur.) and specified microorganism (Ph. Eur). 
The finished product specification includes all relevant test parameters for an oral solution and 
complies in general with Ph. Eur. and the EU/ICH guidelines. All proposed acceptance criteria have 
been sufficiently justified. Proposed acceptance criteria for description of the solution, assay and 
impurities has been re-evaluated according to the presented stability data. Limits for impurities are set 
in line with ICH Q3B. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product was assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and supporting data from stability batches demonstrating that each relevant elemental 
impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE, it can be concluded that no specific 
controls for elemental impurities are required in the finished product specification. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
Assessment report

726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three batches of finished product manufactured at commercial 
scale with active substance from the commercial manufacturer confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Batch 
results for batches manufactured with active substance from a previous supplier and for clinical 
batches were also provided.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from four batches of finished product manufactured at the commercial manufacturer and 
stored for up to 24 months for one batch und up to 18 months for three batches under long term 
conditions (2-8°C and 25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing. Three of these stability batches were manufactured with active substance from a 
previous supplier while one batch was manufactured with active substance from the commercial 
manufacturer. Stability data from three supportive batches is also provided. 
Samples were tested for description, maralixibat assay, degradation products, propylene glycol assay, 
disodium edetate dihydrate assay, weight loss, and microbial quality. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating. All results remained within the specification limits. 
Since the product is packaged in a semi-permeable container and in line ICH Q1A(R2), water 
loss/weight loss at low humidity conditions (25°C / 40% RH and 40°C / 25% RH) was investigated and 
calculated. The data provided demonstrate that the finished product will not have significant water loss 
throughout the proposed shelf life if stored at 25°C at the reference relative humidity of 40% RH. 
Results from forced degradation studies were provided. Samples were exposed to heat, aqueous acidic, 
aqueous basic and oxidative conditions. Significant degradation was seen under oxidative conditions 
and formation of degradation products was observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Significant  degradation  was  observed  in  a  clear  flask,  but  the 
finished product remained stable when protected in an amber coloured PET bottle. 
An  in-use  stability  study  was  conducted  at  30°C  in  support  of  the  shelf-life  after  first  opening  of  the 
bottle. Before starting this study, the medicinal product solution was stored for 8 months at 30°C. Results 
of the study demonstrated that the product is stable for up to 105 days at 30°C. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with the precaution ‘Store in the 
original package in order to protect from light’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is 
acceptable. The product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 24/123 
 
 
 
After the first opening of the bottle, the medicinal product must be used within 100 days and stored 
below 30°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3). After that, the bottle and its contents have to be 
discarded, even if not empty.  
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. A major objection raised during the procedure in relation to 
the designation of a starting material used to manufacture the active substance has been satisfactorily 
resolved. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product which pertain to (1) the introduction of an additional 
manufacturer and all the relevant data related the new starting material, (2) updating of the 
specification for a solvent mixture used in the manufacture of an active substance intermediate (3) 
strengthening of the control strategy for a solvent used for crystallisation in the active substance 
starting material manufacture, (4) extending the in-use shelf life and (5) continuation of development 
work aiming to develop a propylene glycol-free formulation. These points are put forward and agreed 
as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Description of post-authorisation measures

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Nonclinical studies carried out to support the development of maralixibat include in vitro and in vivo 
primary pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety pharmacology studies, absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and elimination (ADME) studies, single-dose toxicity studies, repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
chronic toxicity studies in 2 species, genotoxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, juvenile toxicity 
studies, and so far one completed carcinogenicity study. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Maralixibat is considered a potent inhibitor of the human ASBT. In vitro proof of concept is considered 
established.  
The ASBT transporter protein is highly conserved across species, with the human and mouse proteins 
showing 81% identity and 89% similarity at the amino acid level and with human versus monkey (99% 
similar), dog (93% similar) and rat (89% similar) proteins even more highly conserved and the 
documented in vivo effects of maralixibat across species, including mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, 
indicate the potency and mechanism of action across the nonclinical species.  
The pharmacodynamic effects of maralixibat in vivo were investigated in naïve rats, partial bile duct 
ligated (pBDL) rats as a cholestasis model, dogs and monkeys and in vivo primary pharmacology data 
are in line with the ability of orally administered maralixibat to inhibit the re-uptake of bile acids and to 
increase the faecal excretion thereof.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 26/123 
 
 
 
In naïve male Wistar rats, oral treatment with maralixibat of up to once daily 2 mg/kg for 4 days 
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in faecal bile acid (fBA) excretion up to 3.6-fold with an ED50 of 
approximately 0.027 mg/kg/day. In pBDL male Sprague Dawley rats treated orally once daily with up 
to 10 mg/kg maralixibat statistically significant reductions in sBA and ALT were seen at Day 3, the first 
time of sampling, and reductions in additional liver injury biomarkers at 7 and 14 days. In Beagle dogs 
after oral daily treatment with 1 or 4 mg/kg of maralixibat for 14 days statistically significantly dose-
dependent increases in fBA excretion (up to 5-6 fold compared to pretreatment) and statistically 
significant reductions in serum total and HDL-cholesterol were seen. In Cynomolgus monkeys 
administered oral doses of maralixibat once daily for 7 days, fBA levels were increased by 2- and 5-fold 
at doses of 5.0 and 20.0 mg/kg, respectively.   
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In a secondary pharmacology screen investigating maralixibat at concentrations of up to 100 nM 
neither relevant inhibition nor stimulation of any of the investigated 87 molecular targets was 
identified. Regarding systemic exposure a safety margin of approximately 1,600-fold to the mean 
plasma free drug Cmax at a therapeutic dose level in humans results which is considered sufficient. 
Maralixibat was designed to be poorly absorbed and the drug target, the ASBT, is located on the brush 
border of the enterocytes. Based on a pharmacokinetic modelling exercise maralixibat could inhibit 
luminally expressed transporters with affinities in the lower micromolar range or lower. The potential 
inhibition of OATP2B1 by maralixibat is, mentioned in the SmPC section 4.5. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The applicant submitted a study report on an in vitro hERG channel assay claimed to be GLP compliant. 
Due to several mishaps occurring during the conduct of the study the data obtained are considered 
limited. Maralixibat did not inhibit the hERG channel at a nominal concentration of 1 μM statistically 
significantly different from vehicle control values. A subsequently performed extension of an analytical 
validation study supports the view that the patch-clamp measurements obtained at the nominal 
concentration of 1 µM may be considered true. 
Cardiovascular safety studies in conscious and in anesthetised dogs, with oral and IV administration, 
respectively, CNS safety studies in rats with oral and IV administration, respectively, and respiratory 
safety studies in guinea pigs with IV administration did not reveal concerns regarding cardiovascular, 
CNS or respiratory safety of maralixibat.  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Maralixibat is an OATP2B1 inhibitor based on in vitro studies. A decrease in the oral absorption of 
OATP2B1 substrates (e.g. fluvastatin or rosuvastatin) due to OATP2B1 inhibition in the GI tract cannot 
be ruled out. Therefore, the monitoring of the drug effects of OATP2B1 substrates are advised in SmPC 
4.5. 
Maralixibat is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4 based on in vitro studies. An increase of plasma levels of 
CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam, simvastatin) can therefore not be excluded and the SmPC advises 
caution when such compounds are administered concomitantly. 
Maralixibat, being an inhibitor of bile acid absorption, has not been fully evaluated with regard to the 
interaction potential with the bile acid Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Therefore, the SmPc advises to 
monitor patients that are concomitantly treated with this compound. 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 27/123 
 
 
 
Maralixibat is minimally absorbed, is not significantly metabolised, and is not a substrate of active 
substance drug transporters; therefore, other concomitant medicinal products are not expected to 
affect the disposition of maralixibat. Maralixibat is not expected to inhibit or induce other cytochrome 
P450 in patients; therefore, maralixibat is not predicted to affect the disposition of concomitant 
medicinal products through those mechanisms. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Maralixibat has been in development for more than two decades. The applicant (Mirum) sponsored new 
general toxicity studies in rodents. Embryofetal development was evaluated in rabbit in a study in 
2001. For these two studies, no separate bioanalytical report was provided, however that as well as 
ISR was not required at the time of study conduct. Moreover, both studies include a QA statement 
documenting audit of bioanalytical raw data and toxicokinetics draft reports. 
The bioanalytical programme appears to be and have been in good control with robust bioanalytical 
methods and documented stability of maralixibat in plasma. 
Validation studies were provided for determination of maralixibat in plasma of TgrasH2 and CD-1 mice, 
rats (juvenile and adult), rabbits and dogs. Plasma concentrations of maralixibat were measured by 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Plasma concentrations of 
radiolabeled maralixibat were analysed using liquid scintillation counting (LSC). High performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) was also developed and validated for quantifying maralixibat 
concentrations in diet admix formulations and water.  
Maralixibat showed indications of adherence to surface materials in several studies. The extend is 
unknown. This may result in some discrepancies between intended and applied dose. However, the 
relevance for the safety assessment is considered low.  
Absorption 
Absorption after single or repeated dose oral administration was investigated mice, juvenile and adult 
rats, (pregnant) rabbits, dogs, guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys in a multitude of studies. Due to 
a limited relevance, results in guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys are not discussed in the following. 
Absorption after single dose 
Single dose bioavailability was evaluated in mouse (50, 150 mg/kg), rat (1- 2000 mg/kg), rabbit (50, 
150 mg/kg) and dog (1-1000). Bioavailability was below 1% in all species and tested doses. A study in 
femoral artery and portal vein cannulated rats showed that first pass effect was not the cause of the 
low bioavailability as it only accounted for 7.88% of the administered dose as determined from AUC 
after intravenous and intraportal infusion. A similar study design was used in dog (studies M3098258 
and M3098260), where first pass effect and/or biliary excretion actually was shown to affect the 
bioavailability by up to 79%.  
Absorption in dog was evaluated both after oral gavage and oral capsule. The capsule formulation 
increased Tmax, however bioavailability was still below 1%. In an acute toxicity study, dogs were dosed 
50, 200, 400, 600, 800 or 1,000 mg/kg maralixibat as an oral capsule (SA4948). Emesis increased 
with dose and bioavailability decreased with dose (range 0.08 to 0.02%). 
Absorption after repeat dose 
An extensive amount of repeat-dose pharmacokinetic studies was conducted to evaluate the 
absorption of maralixibat in all relevant species including pregnant rabbits and juvenile rats. Low 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 28/123 
 
 
 
bioavailability was observed in all species except the youngest juvenile rats. Low bioavailability is also 
evident in humans including children. 
Repeat dose in mouse 
Repeat-dose TK of maralixibat in mice was evaluated in 9 studies of 2 to 26 weeks duration. 5 studies 
were using oral gavage and 4 were using dietary admix. The dose-range for oral gavage was 2.5 to 
2.000 mg/kg/day and for dietary admix 5 to 10.000 mg/kg/day. Bioavailability was less than 1% for 
oral gavage and generally even lower for dietary admix. Females showed higher exposure than males 
in the final 26 weeks carcinogenicity study in rasH2 mice at doses 7.5 and 25 mg/kg/day on Day 1 
(MRX-NC-002). Other studies show the same tendency at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (M8562M-
SHP625 and M7614M-SHP625). High accumulation was evident in some dosing groups in study MRX-
NC-002. 
Repeat dose in rat 
Repeat-dose TK in rat was evaluated in 10 studies of 2 to 13 weeks duration in adult rats. 8 studies 
were using oral gavage and 2 were using dietary admix. The dose range for oral gavage was 1-1.500 
mg/kg/day and for dietary admix 150 to 2.000 mg/kg/day. Bioavailability was less than 1% for oral 
gavage and generally even lower for dietary admix, typically less than 0.1%. No obvious sex 
differences were observed, and slight accumulation was only seen at very high doses in female 
animals. 
In the recent 13-week study sponsored by Mirum (MRX-NC-004), the following was concluded: 
No appreciable sex differences observed. The values for Cmax were 1.06, 9.76 and 43.1 ng/mL on Day 
1 and 1.16, 17.4 and 48.9 ng/mL on Day 91 for the 10, 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day doses, respectively. 
The values for AUC0-24hr were 8.70, 129 and 609 ng·hr/mL on Day 1 and 12.2, 129 and 627 
ng·hr/mL on Day 91 for the 10, 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day doses, respectively. 
As dose increased, Cmax and AUC0-24hr also increased, though at a less than dose proportional 
manner from the 10 to 300 mg/kg/day oral dose. The increase was dose proportional from the 300 to 
1,000 mg/kg/day dose. The accumulation ratio was 1.40, 1.38 and 1.03 for the 10, 300 and 1,000 
mg/kg/day doses, respectively, which suggests that accumulation is low following repeated doses. 
Toxicokinetics was evaluated in juvenile rat from PND7 to PND 21 (MRX-NC-001) and from PND21 to 
PND63 (13-4397). The highest exposures were documented in the youngest rat pups on PND 7 and 
decreased significantly on PND 14 and 20. Bioavailability was approximately 17% on PND 7, but 
decreased to <1% by PND 20. This decrease in bioavailability over the course of the experiment was 
likely due to decreasing permeability of the maturing GI tract in the rat pups during the early neonatal 
period. 
In the older juvenile rats, Cmax and AUC0-24hr values were similar or greater on PND 56 compared to 
PND 21. There was some accumulation observed in female rats (accumulation ratio between 1.6 and 
1.8) after repeated doses, which may be in part due to the higher doses administered compared to the 
doses administered to male rats (25-, 50-, 100-, or 200-mg/kg/day dose to males and females were 
administered either a 125-, 250-, 500-, or 1,000-mg/kg/day dose). 
Toxicokinetics after dietary admix was evaluated in pregnant rats in two studies; SA5043 (50, 250 and 
1000 mg/kg/day) and EX5034 (250, 750 and 2,000 mg/kg/day). Exposure was documented; however, 
bioavailability was in the range of 0.04 to 0.25%. 
Repeat dose in rabbit 
Repeat-dose TK in pregnant rabbit was evaluated in two studies (EX5033 and SA5061) covering the 
dose range of 25 to 500 mg/kg/day. In both studies rabbits were dosed from GD7 to GD18 and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 29/123 
 
 
 
bioavailability of maralixibat was < 0.1% across all dose ranges and days of sampling. Exposure was 
too low on GD7 for the lower doses to conclude anything on dose proportionality, however exposure 
was much higher on GD18 than on GD7 for the doses 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. Exposure was higher 
than dose proportional on GD18 in study SA5061 reaching 766 ng/mL*h for the highest dose of 250 
mg/kg/day. It should be noted that rabbits receiving 500 mg/kg/day in the DRF study (EX5033) did 
not survive to GD18. 
Repeat dose in dog 
Repeat-dose TK in dog was evaluated in studies of up to 1-year duration. In general, bioavailability 
was less than 0.2% across the whole dose range of 1 to 600 mg/kg/day. Dogs suffered from emesis, 
hence toxicokinetics may be less reliable, as the fact that many samples were below LLOQ, also show. 
The highest AUC0-24h and Cmax was reached on Day 176 at 100 mg/kg/day in the 1-year toxicity study 
(455 ng/mL*h and 113 ng/mL, respectively). Similar range of exposure was obtained in the 13-week 
toxicity study at the same dose level (SA4991). Accumulation was observed at higher doses (100 and 
300). No sex differences in exposure were observed in any study. Exposure increased with increasing 
dose, however dose proportionality evaluation is deemed unreliable due to the large variability and 
many samples being >LLOQ. In the 1-year study doses up to 20 mg/kg/day was relatively well 
tolerated, providing AUC0-24h and Cmax of 57.7 ng/mL*h and 18.5 ng/mL, respectively (SA4987). 
Plasma concentrations in patients are often below LLOQ of 0.25 ng/mL. 
Distribution 
Distribution was investigated in (pigmented) rats and dogs by the use of [3H] and [14C] labelled 
maralixibat.  
Tissue to plasma ratios of tissues in the gastrointestinal tract was in the range of 100 to 6000 in the 
rat after 5 mg/kg of 14C-maralixibat (study M2098359). Levels of ng equivalents/g in tissues of the 
gastrointestinal tract was largely in a similar range between rat and dog after oral doses of 5 mg or 7.5 
mg/kg of 3H-maralixibat, however levels in female rats were lower than in male. 
Due to maralixibat’s low bioavailability, distribution to other tissues is low, although maralixibat was 
also found in the liver and pancreas of the rat at levels approximately 10 times higher than plasma. 
Maralixibat was detected in many other tissues in low amounts, but at the last time point of 168 hours, 
the highest concentration was still in the small intestine, hence no retention in specific organs was 
observed. No binding to skin was detected (non- or pigmented skin). 
Other tissues than gastrointestinal were not evaluated in the dog. 
Plasma protein binding was determined with [14C]maralixibat for mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, dog 
monkey and human (M3099225), covering the concentration range of 0.25 to 25.0. µg/mL. Plasma 
protein binding was high (99 - 84%) and concentration independent in all species tested. Partitioning 
of 0.250, 2.50 and 25 µg/mL maralixibat into red blood cells of rats (20 – 43%), dogs (22 – 38%) and 
humans (33 – 45%) was determined by the use of [14C]maralixibat in vitro. Partitioning into blood cells 
appears to be dose dependent over the concentration range tested. Results of in vivo studies showed, 
that maralixibat does not preferentially distribute into red blood cells (in vitro: M3099280; in vivo: 
M3099009, M3098328 and M3098330).  
Regarding the volume of distribution, the applicant refers to studies with IV administration performed 
in mice, rats, guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys 
In mice and dogs, the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss,0.622 and 0.257 L/kg, 
respectively) after intravenous application was lower than total body water/ total extracellular fluid 
indicating that maralixibat did not penetrate extensively into tissues. For rats and monkeys, the 
apparent Vss (0.73 and 0.599/0.296 ml/kg. resp.) and the volume of distribution (Vz) following 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 30/123 
 
 
 
intravenous application were slightly higher than the volume of total extracellular water. Furthermore, 
the applicant claims that the volume of distribution and the volume of distribution at steady state for 
guinea pigs were slightly higher than the volume of the total extracellular/ body water without 
providing a reference. Since studies in guinea pigs are limited to studies on excretion and local 
tolerance, this missing information is considered to be of low relevance.  
No information is provided regarding a potential transfer of maralixibat into the milk or the developing 
fetus. This appears to be acceptable in the light of the low bioavailability and the resulting low 
plasmatic levels anticipated in human use.  
Metabolism 
In vitro 
Metabolism was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro metabolism studies were performed in liver 
microsomes of rat, dog, cynomolgus monkeys and human using [14C]maralixibat. Several metabolites 
have been identified. Studies with subsequent HPLRC identified potential sex differences in rats only. 4 
potential metabolites were detected in males and 3 in females. Metabolism rate was low (12.3 % in 
males and 2.4 % in females). In dogs, at least 7 potential metabolites were identified. The metabolism 
rate was slightly higher (21%) compared to rats. Microsomes obtained from Cynomolgus monkeys 
showed the highest similarities to metabolism in humans. Metabolism rate was higher (74% and 69% 
in Cynomolgus monkeys and humans, respectively) compared to rats and dog. In both species, at least 
8 potential metabolites were identified. By subsequent LC/MM/MS and LC-MR detection, 6 potential 
metabolites (M1-M6) were detected. These metabolites included the N-demethylation metabolites of 
maralixibat (M1 and M2) and the hydroxylation metabolites of maralixibat (M3 and M6), as well as the 
N-demethylation and hydroxylation metabolites M4 and M5. Based on this data the applicant has 
proposed an overview on potential metabolic pathways in liver microsomes. In the light of the low 
bioavailability and the rather local mode of action the relevance of the discrepancies between human 
and the species involved in toxicity testing is of minor relevance.  
In vivo 
A potential pre-systemic metabolism was investigated in mice, rats, rabbits and (female) dogs. 
Maralixibat was mainly detected in the faeces. In mice one minor degradation product was identified in 
the faeces (N-demethylated maralixibat; M1) and in rabbits three (M1 (N-demethylated maralixibat); 
M2 (N-di-demethylated maralixibat) and M3 (monohydroxylated maralixibat)). In rats and dogs, 
maralixibat appears to be stable. Systemic metabolism was investigated in rats and dogs following 
intravenous administration. In rats, sex-related difference in the metabolism were noted. In female 
rats, only 2.07% of the dose was metabolised compared to 55.0% in male rats. In dogs the majority of 
the dose was excreted in the faeces as parent compound (65.1%) with a smaller amount excreted as 
metabolite M3 and one other minor degradation product/metabolite M1 (total metabolites = 8.95%). 
No apparent sex-related difference in metabolism was noted. Keeping in mind maralixibat’s low 
bioavailability in all species including humans, potential differences in the metabolic patterns of the 
species involved in toxicity testing has to be considered of minor relevance. The omission of studies of 
Phase II metabolism and induction/inhibition of CYPs is considered acceptable. From pharmacokinetic 
point of view toxicity testing in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits is therefore adequate. 
Excretion 
Excretion of maralixibat following single dose administration was investigated in mice (oral, study 
M3000146), rats (oral, study M2000269, and intravenous, study M2000112), guinea pigs (intravenous, 
study M2000113), rabbits (oral, study M3099010), and dogs (oral and intravenous, studies M2098132, 
M3098330 and M2000114). Excretion after oral repeated dose administration was investigated in mice, 
rats and dogs (studies M3000146, M2000269, M2000114, respectively). Maralixibat was mainly

Page 31/123 
 
 
 
excreted via faeces (71.9 – 96.4%). Only very low amounts could be detected in urine (0.1 to 9.63%). 
Adequate recovery was obtained in all these studies for the conclusions to be considered valid (72.5 to 
96.6%). 
Comparisons with published data (Davies and Morries 1993) showed that the clearance was lower than 
the hepatic blood flow in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. It can, therefore, be concluded that, following 
intravenous administration the excretion of maralixibat is not limited by the hepatic blood flow. The 
applicant claims the same for the guinea pig without providing published evidence.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No robust pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were submitted within the non-clinical part of the 
dossier. The applicant claims completeness of the investigations concerning this point and refers to the 
clinical part of the dossier. There are no objections against the applicant´s approach to place this 
aspect in the clinical part (For further information on this aspect, please, refer to the clinical part of 
this report). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology programme submitted by the applicant is considered to be in general in line 
with the respective guidelines. 
The batches of maralixibat used for the toxicology programme were synthesised using the same 
synthetic route as that used for clinical study batches and that planned for commercial batches, with 
impurity profiles representative of the clinical API.  
The nonclinical PK data indicate that maralixibat is minimally absorbed after oral administration. Since 
systemic exposure following oral administration of maralixibat is low, findings from IV administration 
are not likely to be clinically relevant. 
Toxicology studies with maralixibat (salt form) were conducted in mice, rats, dogs, rabbits, and 
monkeys. For the main nonclinical toxicity assessment, Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs were 
used, and those were also the strains used for key ADME studies in rats and dogs. Various formulations 
of maralixibat API were used, i.e. a simple aqueous solution of maralixibat API in water for oral gavage 
of small animals, dietary admix formulations were used for some repeat-dose toxicity studies and 
maralixibat API in capsules was utilised for dosing of dogs. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies were performed in the rat and in the dog with oral and with IV 
administration of maralixibat.  
In the oral study in rats doses of 0, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg of maralixibat were administered via 
gavage. The minor maralixibat-related adverse effects observed, which were reversible within one 
week, included stool alterations and salivation. 
In the rat study using the IV route doses of 0, 0.06, 0.6 and 6.0 mg/kg were administered. Transient 
clinical signs beginning 10-15 min post-dose were observed at the high dose only, were transient and 
included ataxia, reduced activity, reduced body tone, tremors and dilated pupils. 
In the GLP compliant oral single dose toxicity study in Beagle dogs doses of 0, 50, 200, 400, 600, 800, 
or 1,000 mg/kg were administered. Emesis was observed at doses of ≥ 50 mg/kg and was considered 
severe at doses of ≥ 400 mg/kg. Stool abnormalities were observed at doses of ≥ 200 mg/kg. Exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 32/123 
 
 
 
values were rather similar in the 400 to 1000 mg dose groups, possibly due to either emesis or 
saturation of absorption. 
In the single dose toxicity study in Beagle dogs with IV administration doses of 0, 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg 
of maralixibat, transient clinical neurological signs of lethargy, tremors or muscle stiffness were noted 
at the highest dose. As the exposure (Cmax) is more than 70,000 times higher than the Cmax reported 
for humans receiving about 3 times the clinically intended maximum therapeutic oral dose for two 
weeks, the neurological signs seen in the dog are considered of no clinical relevance. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice for up to 13 weeks, in rats for up to 26 weeks, in 
dogs for up to one year and in the monkey for 2 weeks. The duration of the chronic repeated dose 
toxicity studies is in line with ICH M3. The route of administration was the oral route, the route of 
administration in humans. A total of 27 repeated dose studies were performed. A part of them aimed 
at finding an appropriate dose for carcinogenicity studies in mice. In mice and rats, a part of the 
studies was conducted using gavage and another part was conducted using dietary admixture. 
Bioavailability of maralixibat in the repeated dose studies was generally below 1%. 
Mouse 
The three GLP compliant repeated dose toxicity studies in CD-1 mice were conducted with treatment 
durations of 13 weeks. In two of these studies maralixibat was administered via oral gavage, one via 
admixture to the diet. Dosages in the studies using gavage were 0, 50, 150, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day and 
0, 50 250, 750 mg/kg/day, respectively, in the study using dietary admixture 0, 50, 150 and 750 
mg/kg/day were administered. In the studies using gavage deaths were mostly attributed to gavage 
errors/aspiration or respiratory distress due gaseous distended abdomen especially in high dose 
groups. The latter effect is considered to be possibly related to a change in the intestinal 
microenvironment due to administration of maralixibat. Reduction in bodyweight/- gains have been 
seen predominantly in male animals and at higher dosages. A consistent finding in the studies is 
prolongation of coagulation parameters (PT, aPTT) in males starting from the lowest dose of 50 
mg/kg/day of maralixibat (gavage or admix). The applicant considers this effect likely to be caused by 
vitamin K deficiency. In the mouse repeated dose toxicity studies no bleeding events were reported. 
Increases in cecum and/or colon weights are reported in both genders in all studies and they are 
possibly related to the oral administration of poorly absorbable material. Increases in faecal bile acid 
excretion, the expected main pharmacological effect of maralixibat, were seen in all of these studies. 
In the studies using gavage, increases in serum cholesterol/HDL are reported at the highest 
administered doses. These effects, although not expected as a direct pharmacological effect of 
maralixibat, according to the applicant increases of serum cholesterol in rodents treated with certain 
cholesterol-lowering drugs (like the statins) have previously been described and are thought to be 
related to strong induction of HMG-CoA reductase. 
The NOAEL in the mouse gavage study SA4954, the study of the two gavage studies with more 
parameters investigated, is considered to be the MD of 150 mg/kg/day. Mean combined Cmax was 71.7 
ng/mL and AUC0-24hr was 529 hr•ng/mL. In humans after administration of once daily doses of 100 mg 
maralixibat for 14 days, mean Cmax was 1.146 ng/mL and mean AUC0-24 was 4.614 ng•h/mL were 
reported. As this dosage in humans is about three times the clinically maximally intended one, 
assuming dose linearity, exposure based safety factors between NOAEL in this study and the maximum 
clinical dose of at least 136 (Cmax, male animals) and 310 (AUC female animals) result. The NOAEL in 
the mouse study SA5005 with admixture to diet is considered to equal the HD of 750 mg/kg/day. A 
mean gender-combined Cmax of 21.9 ng/mL and AUC0-24hr of 453 ng•h/mL were reported which would 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 33/123 
 
 
 
under the same assumption result in exposure based safety factors of at least 55 (outlier-eliminated 
Cmax in male animals) and 279 (outlier eliminated AUC0-24hr in male animals) result. Considering the 
toxicological effects reported in the repeated dose toxicity studies with maralixibat in mice these 
exposure based safety factors are considered sufficient. 
Rat 
Six GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity studies in rats were performed with a treatment duration of 
13 weeks/3 months. In five of the 13 week studies maralixibat was administered orally via gavage, in 
the remaining one and in the 26 week GLP compliant study via dietary admix. Three of the gavage 
studies and one of the dietary admix 13 week studies included recovery periods of 4 weeks. The 
maximum dosages in the gavage studies ranged from 150 mg/kg/day to 1500 mg/kg/day. In two of 
these studies males received up to two thirds lower dosages than females. In the dietary admix study 
of 13 weeks duration the highest dose level was 1500 mg/kg/day. In the 26 week dietary admix study 
the dose levels were initially 0 (males + females), 30 (males only), 150 (males + females), 500 
(females only), 750 (males only), and 2000 (females only) mg/kg/day of maralixibat. Due to high 
mortalities in HD groups, the dose in HD males was lowered around week 12 from 750 to 300 
mg/kg/day and in the group of HD females around week 12 from 2000 to 1500 mg/kg/day of 
maralixibat. 
In general, in the studies with administration of maralixibat via oral gavage a considerable number of 
deaths were attributed to aspiration of dosing solution. In all but two repeated dose toxicity studies in 
rats, especially in male animals, prolongation of coagulation parameters with bleeding events at higher 
dosages were seen. The lowest dose at which prolongation of PT and aPTT was already seen, was 5 
mg/kg/day of maralixibat (study SA4865) and at 500 mg/kg/day (study SA5006) fatal bleeding events 
occurred in male animals. When investigated, the prolonged coagulation times showed reversibility. 
The applicant considers secondary to loss of bile acids induced vitamin K deficiency a likely cause for 
the prolongation of coagulation times/bleeding events. Prolongation in coagulation time was only 
considered an adverse effect by the applicant if it was associated with bleeding event. This is not 
endorsed, as increasing PT and APTT precedes the bleeding event and the increasing values should 
therefore be considered an adverse effect in itself. However, as vitamin K deficiency and prolonged 
coagulation time appears to be rodent specific and not a problem at clinically relevant doses in dog, 
monkey or human, the issue will not be further pursued.  
Another phenomenon/clinical observation associated with maralixibat treatment is the discolouration of 
papers placed under the cages or unusual urine colour. In one study this was already seen at a dose as 
low as 5 mg/kg/day and studies hint that this phenomenon is more prominent in MD than in HD 
animals. The applicant was unable to identify the cause of this staining and states that repeated 
urinalyses have excluded urinary blood. In the same two studies, in which no prolongation of 
coagulation parameters was reported (studies R7834 and MRX-NC-004) no such staining of cage 
papers was reported. Moderate decreases in body weight gains were seen repeatedly in males, 
whereas in females only at higher dosages. 
An effect on liver were detected in rats (and to a lesser extent in dogs), as decreased liver weight, 
decreases in serum cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides but also changes in ALT/AST and proteins (albumin 
and globulins). It is considered plausible, that a change in hepatic activity with respect to bile acid and 
lipid metabolism potentially could affect related parameter i.e. cholesterol, HDL, triglyceride.  
Faecal bile acid excretion increased consistently already starting at the lowest doses tested (5 
mg/kg/day; e.g. in study SA4865 at this dosage already up to 10-fold increase compared to control).  
Slight increases of serum phosphorus were considered secondary to the changes in serum protein 
levels. Slightly increased serum sodium and/or chloride occurred at all levels and were attributed to 
possibly increased permeability of the intestinal tract following exposure to increased concentrations of 
bile acids.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 34/123 
 
 
 
Increasing weight of the intestinal segments in mice and rats was found and was accepted to be a 
result of poor absorption of large amounts of orally administered material. Increased urine calcium 
levels were attributed to caecal enlargement, which has been associated with increased intestinal 
absorption and renal excretion of calcium. 
Microscopic changes in cecum, colon and rectum of mucus depletion of goblet cell, oedema in lamina 
propria, non-suppurative inflammation and mucosal epithelial alterations e.g. crowding of crypt cells 
with thickening of mucosa, was shown to be a result of increasing levels of luminal fBA. Even though 
increasing fBA levels is a pharmacological effect of maralixibat and most GI microscopical changes 
were reversed at treatment discontinuation, highlighting these changes is considered relevant, as 
abdominal pain and diarrhoea were observed as common adverse reactions in human patients. A 
potential risk of carcinogenic transformation of the GI mucosal epithelial alterations (e.g. 
crowding/proliferation of crypt cells) should be excluded histologically when 2-year rat CARC data are 
available (see section 2.5.4.4). 
Due to fatal bleeding events in HD animals in the GLP compliant pivotal repeated dose toxicity study in 
rats with the longest maralixibat treatment duration of 26 weeks (Study SA4988), the dose of the MD 
animals is considered being the NOAEL, which is 150 mg/kg/day in male rats and 500 mg/kg/day in 
female rats. The exposure in male rats at this NOAEL was 5.42 ng/mL (Cmax) and 108 ng•h/mL (AUC) 
and in female animals 13.5 ng/mL (Cmax) and 241 ng•h/mL (AUC). In humans after administration of 
once daily doses of 100 mg maralixibat for 14 days, mean Cmax was 1.146 ng/mL and mean AUC0-24 
was 4.614 ng•h/mL were reported. As this dosage in humans is about three times the clinically 
maximally intended one, assuming dose linearity, exposure-based safety factors between NOAEL in 
this study and the maximum clinical dose of at least 13 (Cmax, male animals, 150 mg/kg/day) and 70 
(AUC male animals, 150 mg/kg/day) result. Considering that the main toxicological and dose limiting 
effect reported in this and the other repeated dose toxicity studies with maralixibat in rats is the 
prolongation of coagulation factors leading to bleeding events in higher doses and that this is an effect 
not observed in humans, these exposure-based safety factors are considered sufficient. As the 
bioavailability of maralixibat is very low (in general below 1%) the use of doses instead of systemic 
exposure for calculation of safety margins is acceptable as well. According to a table provided by the 
applicant, it appears that high safety margins to human doses exists, which is also the case in most of 
the studies conducted. However, it should be noted that safety margins were only calculated for 
selected repeat-dose studies in which a NOAEL was determined. In a number of the studies, no NOAEL 
could be determined. The primary toxicity observed in mice and rats, were prolongation of coagulation 
time. Changes in coagulation parameters were detected at doses as low as 5 mg/kg in rats (HED = 0.8 
mg/kg*), which do not provide much of a safety margin to the human dose of 0.38 mg/kg. As also 
discussed, the prolonged coagulation appears to be rodent specific and not a notable problem in dog, 
monkey or human patients.  With the warning in SmPC section 4.4 „Assessment of fat-soluble vitamin 
(FSV) levels (Vitamins A, D, E) and international normalised ratio (INR) are recommended for all 
patients prior to initiating Livmarli, with monitoring per standard clinical practice. “ this issue is 
considered appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Dog 
Repeated dose toxicity studies of 2 weeks (EX4798), 4 weeks (SA4877, SA4945), 13 weeks (SA4991) 
and 6 to 12 months (SA4987) have been performed in beagle dogs. Maralixibat was given in an oral 
gelatin capsule up to 600 mg/kg/day (13 week study SA4991). With the exception of the 2 week study 
all studies were performed GLP compliant. All studies were accompanied by toxicokinetic evaluation. 
Recovery groups were included in the 4-week studies (SA4877, SA4945) and the 6 to 12 month study 
(SA4987). 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 35/123 
 
 
 
In dogs, the tolerable dose was limited by exaggerated emesis as demonstrated in the 4 week study 
(SA4945). In this study, the high dose study group (600 mg/kg/day) was withdrawn due to 
exaggerated emesis. A maralixibat associated increase in emesis was observed at doses of 100 
mg/kg/day and above. In addition, in some cases slight decreases in body weights or body weight 
gains were observed. To a lesser extend as compared to rats, an increase in coagulation time was 
observed. Significant changes were observed in the combined 6 to 12 month repeated dose toxicity 
study at the highest dose group of 100 mg/kg/day. The applicant associates this finding with a vitamin 
K deficiency, which is considered acceptable.  
Several other findings were associated with the pharmacodynamic activity such as a decreased plasma 
or liver cholesterol / HDL / triglyceride concentration or an increased faecal bile salt excretion, which 
are clearly caused by the pharmacodynamic activity of maralixibat. Some findings in the field of clinical 
chemistry such as total protein, albumin, globulin (and their respective ratio), [Cl-] and [Na+] 
concentration, which reached significance in the 6 to 12 month study in some dose groups are less 
clear associated with the pharmacodynamic activity but overall reversible and of low magnitude and, 
therefore, of low physiological relevance. Significant changes of liver enzyme concentrations in serum 
(increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased alkaline phosphatase) in all dosing groups were 
considered also to be associated with the pharmacodynamic activity of maralixibat.  
The applicant believes that the combination of changes in serum phosphorus and ALP along with the 
increased urinary excretion of phosphorus suggests that decreased serum ALP values may be related 
to a decreased osteoblastic activity. The conclusion appears to be reasonable, however, a sound 
conclusion cannot be drawn.  
Two treatment-related histological changes (decreased eosinophilia in the fundic parietal cell and 
pyloric stomach cell cytoplasmic vacuolisation) were observed in the stomach at the Week 53 sacrifice. 
Decreased eosinophilia in the fundic parietal cell was noted in 100 mg/kg animals and pyloric stomach 
cell cytoplasmic vacuolisation was noted in 5, 20 and 100 mg/kg animals. These lesions remained 
present at the Week 61 (8-week reversal post 1 year of dosing) sacrifice but were considered to be 
incidental and of no further relevance.  
The NOAEL in dogs based on the pivotal study with a duration of 1 year is 20 mg/kg/day. An 
approximation using exposure in humans and dogs would result in safety factors between 38 to 48 
times. This is considered sufficient. 
Monkey 
In addition, one non-pivotal repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey was submitted, which 
was performed more than 20 years ago. This study would be considered a breach of the principles of 
3R nowadays. Furthermore, it should be noted that, the death of one monkey was caused by a dosing 
error (rupture of the oesophagus), which is hardly acceptable in non-human primates. The only 
noteworthy finding was an increased spleen weight and decreased colon weight.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Maralixibat was negative in in vitro Ames tests, chromosome aberration assays in CHO cells and in an 
oral in vivo micronucleus test performed in rats. Exposure was not determined in the micronucleus 
test, however, there were signs of toxicity and excess mortality in the high dose animals indicating 
sufficient exposure of animals. Based on the provided studies, maralixibat is not considered to be 
genotoxic in vitro and in vivo.

2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity was determined in rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies. One incomplete study 
evaluating carcinogenicity of maralixibat when administered to rats in the diet for at least 104 weeks 
was provided. Due to deprioritisation of the programme by a previous sponsor, microscopic evaluation 
of tissues was discontinued, and tissues were discarded, thus the full investigation of carcinogenicity 
potential from this study was not available. A further 2-year carcinogenicity in rats was started in 4Q of 
2020. The provided study design is considered adequate. Results of the planned carcinogenicity should 
be provided as soon as data become available. There were higher incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar 
adenoma and carcinoma in Tg rasH2 male mice administered 25 mg/kg/day maralixibat.  
Bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas were statistically significant for incidence and trend, as was the 
combined incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma and bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. The applicant 
argues that lung tumours (bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma and carcinoma) are the most common 
spontaneous neoplasms reported in Tg rasH2 mice and their incidences in males administered 25 
mg/kg/day maralixibat in this study (24% and 4%, respectively) are within published control ranges 
(Paranjpe et al., 2019). It is agreed that lung tumours are common background tumours in this mouse 
strain. However, Paranjpe et al reported a range for single adenoma of 0 - 24%/study (years 2004 – 
2018) and an average of 8.98%. This indicates that lung adenoma incidences reported here are in the 
upper range of published background findings and higher than the average reported by Paranjpe et al. 
In addition, historical background findings of control mice of the test facility were presented. The 
incidence for bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma in male mice was above the historical control range of the 
test facility (24% vs 16% upper range, respectively), while bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma was within 
historical control ranges (4% vs 12.5% upper range, respectively). It is discussed by the applicant that 
bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas occurred without multiplicity as single tumours and 
without evidence of a continuum of progression from bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia to adenoma to 
carcinoma. Despite this it cannot completely be ruled out that lung tumour findings in male mice are 
maralixibat-related. In addition, a potential risk of carcinogenic transformation of the GI mucosal 
epithelial alterations (e.g. crowding/proliferation of crypt cells) observed in rat repeat-dose toxicity 
studies should be excluded histologically when 2-year rat carcinogenicity data are available. Thus, a 
definite conclusion of carcinogenic potential of maralixibat will need be drawn after review of data from 
the ongoing rat carcinogenicity study, which will be provided by October 2023 as outlined in the RMP. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A full range of reproductive and juvenile toxicity studies were submitted.  
Possible drug related effects on male and female fertility / reproductive capacity, prenatal, postnatal, 
and juvenile development were investigated in rats, while rabbits served as second species for 
evaluation of adverse effects on embryofetal development.  
Many of the pivotal studies were preceded by DRF studies. All pivotal studies were conducted in 
accordance with current guidelines and GLP regulations. Regarding the juvenile toxicity studies, the 
treatment period covers a human age range from birth to adolescence.  
For the reproductive toxicity studies performed in rats, the sponsor selected dietary administration 
over gastric intubation (gavage) based on his experience with negative effects of aspiration of liquid 
formulations in studies conducted previously. However, it was shown later during drug development 
that gavage administration was principally possible even in juvenile rats. Unfortunately, no measure 
was taken to prevent access of offspring to the maternal diet in the PPND study, where adverse effects 
on pups’ body weights were considered due to consuming the maternal diet at the time when the 
offspring start to eat on their own. 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 37/123 
 
 
 
Toxicokinetic evaluations were done in almost all studies. The obtained values were qui variable and 
contamination of control samples were observed in the PPND and juvenile toxicity studies. According to 
the applicant, an extensive investigation was conducted, and the most likely explanation is that 
contamination occurred to the blood samples after collection from the animals. The applied LC-MS/MS 
method is very sensitive (subnanomolar) and even detects very small levels of contamination e.g. 
through airborne aerosols. This is agreed.  
Toxic effects in adult rats generally resembled those observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies 
conducted in this species. While male fertility was not affected at all up to the highest dose tested (750 
mg/kg/d), in female rats, doses of 500 mg/kg/d and above reduced ovulation rate resulting in a 
decreased number of corpora lutea and implantation sites, respectively. 
Embryofetal development was not affected in either rats or rabbits, despite maternal toxicity (body 
weight loss) in the latter species. In addition, there were no adverse effects on prenatal and postnatal 
development including sexual maturation and reproductive capacity as well as learning and memory 
abilities noted in the offspring of dams exposed to maralixibat during gestation and lactation.  
While treatment of juvenile rats following weaning did not adversely affect their viability, mortality / 
moribundity was noted in all treatment groups in juvenile rats treated from PND 7 to 21. In the DRF 
study doses ≥ 500 mg/kg/day were associated with drug-related mortality in 4 females. In the pivotal 
study doses up to 250 mg/kg/day induced no article-related mortality. In this study mortality was 
considered due to septicemia in 3 rats and gavage error in another one in the HD group, whereas the 
cause of deaths could not be identified for 5 rats each in the LD and MD group, respectively. 
In contrast to other nonclinical studies with maralixibat, relatively large systemic exposures were seen 
in juvenile rats treated from PND 7 to PND 21. Plasma AUCs did not significantly increase with 
increases in dose, indicating saturation of absorption at the lowest dose; thus, estimated oral 
bioavailability was also highest (approximately 17%) at the lowest dose on the first day of dosing. 
Estimated bioavailability by the end of the study on PND 21 was similar to that seen in adult animals, 
likely due to rapid maturation of the GI tract in rats between PNDs 7 and 21. Despite these high 
plasma exposures, maralixibat did not induce major signs of toxicity at doses up to 250 mg/kg/d in 
both sexes. 
According to the applicant, the clinical significance of increased bioavailability on PND 7 rats is likely 
low. Rat pups at PND 7 are generally representative of a preterm infant in terms of whole animal 
development, while 10-day-old rats correspond to human term neonates and 21-day-old rats to an 
infant / toddler aged 2 years. Regarding the GI tract, the newborn rat possesses a very immature 
system with barely differentiated tissues presenting only a minimal barrier to macromolecules 
(reviewed in Walthall et al. 2005). This is in contrast to a human full-term newborn who possesses a 
much more mature GI tract that becomes impermeable to macromolecules within days after birth in 
response to oral feeding (reviewed in Neal-Kluever et al. 2019).  
Given the relative maturity of the human GI tract already at birth and the fact that maralixibat is 
indicated for treatment of children aged 2 months and older, no major risk for the paediatric 
population is anticipated.  
2.5.4.6.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance was investigated in guinea pig on dermal sensitisation potential after intradermal and 
topical administration and in rabbits on dermal and eye irritation. Potential local effects on colonic or 
rectal mucosa were investigated in female rats. The relevance of the studies in guinea pig on dermal 
sensitisation potential after intradermal and topical administration and in rabbits on dermal and eye 
irritation appears to be questionable. However, based on these studies a sensitisation potential of 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 38/123 
 
 
 
maralixibat appears to be unlikely. In the eye, maralixibat showed a moderate to mild irritating 
potential. Potential local effects on colonic or rectal mucosa as found in the main toxicity studies were 
investigated in female rats further. In these studies, a mucus depletion of colonic goblet cells, oedema 
of the colonic lamina propria was confirmed. However, this finding was associated with the fasting 
conditions of the animals. It can be assumed, that these effects were caused by a local irritation 
caused by an increased bile salt concentration in the faeces. The human relevance appears to be low.

The applicant did not provide the full study report for the determination of the n-octanol/water

the provided summary report can be accepted as relevant data/information are included. As logD of 
1.53 is clearly below the action limit of 4.5 a screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is 
deemed not required. 
Maralixibat PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Maralixibat is considered a potent inhibitor of the human ASBT. In vitro proof of concept is considered 
established using cells transfected with the human ASBT.  
The ASBT transporter protein is highly conserved across species, with the human and mouse proteins 
showing 81% identity and 89% similarity at the amino acid level and with human versus monkey (99% 
similar), dog (93% similar) and rat (89% similar) proteins even more highly conserved and the 
documented in vivo effects of maralixibat across species, including mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, 
indicate the potency and mechanism of action across the nonclinical species.  
The applicant submitted a study report on an in vitro hERG channel assay claimed to be GLP compliant. 
Due to several mishaps occurring during the conduct of the study the data obtained are considered 
limited. Maralixibat did not inhibit the hERG channel at a nominal concentration of 1 μM statistically 
significantly different from vehicle control values. A subsequently performed extension of an analytical 
validation study supports the view that the patch-clamp measurements obtained at the nominal 
concentration of 1 µM may be considered true. 
Cardiovascular safety studies in conscious and in anesthetised dogs, with oral and IV administration, 
respectively, CNS safety studies in rats with oral and IV administration, respectively, and respiratory 
safety studies in guinea pigs with IV administration did not reveal concerns regarding cardiovascular, 
CNS or respiratory safety of maralixibat.

Pharmacokinetics of maralixibat was investigated in numerous studies in mice, adult and juvenile rats, 
pregnant and non-pregnant rats, pregnant rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys. Studies on 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion were provided. Maralixibat has to be characterised 
as a substance of very low bioavailability, with a local mode of action. Overall, the study programme 
appears to be appropriate and complete, justifying from pharmacokinetic point of view the species 
involved in toxicity testing.  
A very comprehensive general toxicity programme was conducted in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys 
with maralixibat administration by oral gavage, dietary admix and capsules. Generally, bioavailability 
was low after oral administration (<1%) and the majority of findings in the toxicity studies were 
therefore related to the pharmacological effect of maralixibat rather than the systemic toxicity. 
Findings from iv administration in single-dose studies are therefore not likely to be clinically relevant. 
Single dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs with oral and with IV administration did not raise safety 
concerns regarding the intended use in humans. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Duration of maralixibat 
treatments in the GLP-compliant pivotal chronic repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs comply 
with the requirements for the intended chronic use in humans. Maralixibat is not genotoxic. A 2-year 
carcinogenicity in rats is ongoing. The provided study design is considered adequate. Results of the 
ongoing carcinogenicity will be provided by October 2023 as defined in the RMP. In the 26-week 
carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice reported lung adenoma incidences are in the upper range of 
published background incidence and higher than the average reported by Paranjpe et al. In addition, 
the incidence for bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma in male mice was above the historical control range of 
the test facility (24% vs 16% upper range, respectively), while bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma was 
within historical control ranges (4% vs 12.5% upper range, respectively). Whilst it is not expected that 
lung tumour findings in male mice are maralixibat-related it cannot completely ruled out. A final 
conclusion of carcinogenic potential of maralixibat in rodents, which is outlined as missing information 
in the RMP, can only be drawn after review of data from the ongoing rat carcinogenicity study 
(category 3 study in the RMP). 
In line with the proposed indication “Treatment of cholestatic liver disease in patients with Alagille 
syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older”, a full range of reproductive and juvenile toxicity studies 
were submitted, which do not raise any concerns.  
Maralixibat PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5.

Methods 
Plasma concentrations of maralixibat were determined by validated LC-MS/MS methods. Serum levels 
of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids were also determined using validated LC-MS/MS methods as 
well as concentrations of the endogenous biomarker, 7α-hydroxy-cholest-4-en-3-one (C4). The 
method validations and documentation for sample analysis is accepted and missing information has 
been provided upon request.  
Additional validation results for a couple of biomarkers have been presented, of which the one for bile 
acids is considered the most important, because this has been used both as PD, as well as efficacy 
parameter. Satisfactory documentation of linearity of this method has been submitted upon request 
Absorption  
The applicant has conducted 4 PK studies in order to determine the PK of the compound in healthy 
adult subjects 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Study MN4-02-06-002 which has investigated the safety and PK of single doses 
Study NB402-06-003, which has investigated multiple (ascending doses) 
Study NB-02-06-004 which was an ADME study with radioactively marked compound given as 
single dose 
Study MRX-102 which was a single to study with the to-be-marketed liquid formulation. 
Despite a sensitive method used for the detection of the compound (LloQ=0.025 ng/ml) hardly any 
substance could be found in plasma or could derived PK parameters be calculated in appropriate 
manner. In consequence, it is concluded that the substance is very poorly absorbed, and maximum 
plasma levels are reached between 1.0 to 3.0 hours. The estimated half-life of the compound in 
plasma has been determined to be about 4 hours, but this had to be based on the evaluation of high 
doses (above the therapeutic dose-range proposed for children with PFIC2). The study with the to-be-
marketed formulation did not provide different results. 
The following table shows “typical” results from these early studies, demonstrating the negligible 
absorption:

Table 5 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Plasma Maralixibat (Single Ascending 
Doses) (Study NB4-02-06-002) 
In accordance with this, the ADME study did not detect measurable radioactivity in plasma, and more 
than 99% of the detected radioactivity was detected in faeces, primarily as parent compound (>94%), 
which three different metabolites having a share of 1%-5%. The radioactivity detected in urine 
amounted to 0.066%. Although the overall recovery in this study was only about 73%, the results 
were considered valid, due to the fact that they were in accordance with the previous studies in 
healthy volunteers showing minimal plasma levels. 
Bioavailability/Bioequivalence 
Data on absolute bioavailability are, however, not available because no i.v. administration was included 
in any of the studies. The estimated bioavailability is expected to be less than 1%. The applicant has 
therefore also not evaluated bioequivalence of the different formulations, which is also based on the 
fact that the solid dosage forms used were rapidly dissolving pharmaceutical forms, which is altogether 
considered acceptable. 
Influence of food 
The applicant has evaluated the influence of food in two studies (Study MRX-102 and Study NB4-02-
06-002) with different dose levels (10, 20, and 45 mg). These studies were partially hampered by the 
low plasma levels detected. Based on the available results, however, it could be concluded that food 
further reduces the overall low bioavailability of the compound to a relevant extent (60-80%).  
The results for the statistical evaluation of study MRX-201 are shown in the following table:

While in a compound with systemic action, this would lead to the recommendation to administer the 
compound in the fasted state, the proposed recommendation initially was to administer the compound 
half an hour before food intake. This is obviously based on theoretical reflections based on PK as well 
as PD considerations: The highest concentrations would need to be present in the intestine (lower part 
of the small intestine. Any absorption would be regarded to be untoward with regard to the PD effects, 
as well as with regard to safety of the compound. While optimality of the proposed 30 minutes window 
has not been investigated, it takes not only the food effect into account, but also the consideration that 
inhibition of bile-acid (re-)absorption would be inhibited highest at the time of highest bile acid 
secretion, which itself depends on the intake of food. Indeed, study NB4-02-06-002 has shown that 
bile acid absorption inhibition is abolished with prolonged fasting. Therefore, the final recommendation 
with regard to medication intake in relation to food intake has been determined to allow flexibility 
either before (up to 30 minutes), or together with food – which includes the mode of intake within 
clinical trials. 
Distribution 
The compound, once absorbed, is expected to be highly bound to plasma proteins (>90% in vitro) 
based on the results of the in vitro study M3099225. Plasma protein binding was within 84.2% to 
97.3% for all species tested and was found to be concentration independent across the concentration 
range. Protein binding, as well as the distribution of the compound have not been investigated in vivo. 
While distribution could be determined in some of the studies, due to the low plasma concentrations, 
the estimates are likely to be inaccurate and the missing of such an estimate is acceptable. 
Elimination 
As seen in the ADME study, the compound is mainly eliminated in the faeces, and hepatic uptake, 
metabolism and/or renal excretion are not expected to play a relevant role in PK. Approximately 72% 
of the radioactive dose was detected in faeces compared to <1% in urine. 
In 10 healthy fasted subjects (study MRX-102) receiving single doses of 100 mg maralixibat, the 
estimated terminal half-life (t1/2) was 1,97 h. The estimated clearance of 7700 L/h is unreliable with 
the extrapolation portion of AUC∞ >20% for the majority of participants.  
In patients, no elimination parameters could be calculated. 
In consequence of the low plasma levels, the applicant has investigated the potential for hepatic 
metabolism in vitro only. The metabolic profile of the compound has been determined in vitro with 
study M4099002, and it was shown that metabolisation appears to be extensive (almost 70% with 60 
minutes incubation). More than 10 metabolites were identified (of which none was unique to humans) 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 45/123 
 
 
 
 
However, in face of the minimal absorption, as well as less than 3% of radioactivity detected as 
metabolites (most of these in faeces), the relevance of the findings appears to be minor. 
Although extensive metabolism of the compound was detected and 6 metabolites have been 
characterised, no further investigation was performed due to the expected small contribution of 
metabolites to the overall limited total exposure. This is considered acceptable. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality as a method of PK characterisation was also hampered by the fact that the 
compound is poorly absorbed only. There was indication of increasing concentration/exposure with 
doses higher than 20 mg, but a clear linear relation could not be demonstrated. No relevant differences 
were detected between single and multiple doses of the compound, although a formal evaluation of 
time-dependency was not conducted (but considered acceptable).  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
As expected, no numerical determination of the variability of PK parameters was presented, which is, 
however, also considered acceptable. A high variability of PK parameters is obvious from the data. In 
the 100 mg dosing group of the food effect study MRX-102, the coefficient of variation for AUC0-inf 
and Cmax is 73% and 52%, respectively. 
Special populations 
The applicant has investigated PK in different diseased populations (adults with cholestatic liver 
diseases, such as PBC and PSC), adolescents with hypercholesterolaemia, and children with Alagille 
and PFIC. All these investigations were done with sparse sampling, both after single and multiple drug 
administration, with the time point mainly after 4 hours post drug intake. The doses used in these 
studies were variable, but usually (based on body weight) lower than those proposed for the ALGS 
target population. In all these studies, drug concentrations were below LoQ in the majority of patients, 
and hardly any concentrations were detected being above 1.0 ng/ml. This also clearly applies to the 
studies in the target population where doses more similar to the proposed doses for marketing were 
tested (including the ongoing MRX-801 study in children younger than 1 year of age, who are being 
treated with the proposed dosing regimen; Note: only interim PK results available from this study). 
Nevertheless, this study confirmed that there is literally no difference in PK between infants and older 
children with ALGS. A more permeable intestinal barrier may occur in situations where the 
gastrointestinal system is acute or chronically disturbed (e.g. in inflammatory bowel diseases, or leaky 
gut syndrome) and could lead to higher exposure of maralixibat. However, much higher systemic 
exposure has been achieved with MRX in previous human (adults) and non-clinical studies without 
critical safety findings. These data suggest that even if higher exposure levels are reached in infants, 
these are likely not to represent a hazard. Furthermore, such patients, and especially those under the 
age of 1 year, will be closely monitored for safety in the post-authorisation phase (LEAP study) which 
is a special obligation to this Marketing Authorisation. 
The applicant has evaluated the PK in special populations upon request. For hepatically impaired 
patients, the applicant has made the case that a high percentage of the patients included in the clinical 
studies had liver impairment according to the NCI-ODWG criteria. However, it is currently not known 
whether this classification is appropriate in cholestatic liver disease, and Alagille’ Syndrome. Due to the 
missing of data for patients with advanced liver disease (cirrhosis) and signs of decompensation, a 
respective warning has been included into the PI (SmPC section 4.2).  
The missing of such data for renal impairment was considered acceptable based on the minimal plasma 
concentrations and on animal data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 46/123 
 
 
 
The applicant has retrospectively evaluated whether demographic factors such as age, gender and race 
would influence the PK of the compound. While variability with these factors is partially rather high, the 
plasma levels appear to be grossly independent from the influence of age, sex and race. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant has determined the interaction potential of the compound mainly with in vitro 
investigations, using in vitro assays for cytochrome induction, and inhibition, as well as transporter 
inhibitions. These investigations identified CYP3A4/5 and the transporter OATP2B1 as the only 
“candidates” for a relevant inhibition by the compound. This is not only based on the (relative to the 
other CYPs and transporters) lower inhibitory concentrations, but also to the fact that both are also 
located in the intestinal mucosa, and could cause a PK inhibition at the local, pre-systemic level. 
The applicant is presenting 4 in vivo studies in order to address the potential for drug-drug interaction. 
Three of these studies (NB4-02-06-008, NB4-01-06-019, and NB4-02-06-020) were studies with the 
statins lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin. These compounds were thought to be substrates of 
several organic anion transporters, including OATP2B1. At least two of the compounds are also highly 
dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism (simvastatin and atorvastatin). The results of the study with 
Atorvastatin are displayed in the following table: 
Table 7 Results of a Statistical Comparison of Atorvastatin, ortho-Hydroxyatorvastatin and 
para-Hydroxyatorvastatin Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Morning (AM) 
Administration of Atorvastatin Alone or in Combination with SD-5613 
These studies did not detect a potential for a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction. However, all 
these studies were hampered by the fact that only rather small doses of maralixibat were used. The 
applicant has provided argumentation with regard to the different IC50s of the compound in relation to 
inhibition of OATP2B1 and ASBT, however, this did not take into account the concentrations of the 
active compound expected in the (respective parts of) intestine. Since no adequate data are available, 
a respective warning has been included in the PI that there is a theoretical risk of interaction with 
substrates of OATP1B2. 
The DDI potential for competitive and mechanism based inhibition of CYP3A4 was further investigated 
using a PBPK model in SimCyp. The developed PBPK-Model indicates that CYP3A4 inhibition potential is 
likely low due to low systemic exposure. Modeled population mean increase in AUC and Cmax after the 
highest dose of 600 mg/kg BID was 10%, calculated with the predicted fuGut of 0.096. In a worst-case 
scenario calculated for a fuGut of 1, the increase was estimated to be 31%. Sensitivity analysis showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 47/123 
 
 
 
 
an increase of Midazolam exposure up to 40%, which might be clinically relevant for DDI regarding 
CYP3A4 but is regarded as unlikely (Ki was varied 100-fold). 
Model development was impaired by the low number of individuals (six subjects) contributing to model 
verification. Additionally, model development was based on data collected in healthy adults; 
transferability to a paediatric population with Alagille syndrome is regarded as limited. It is understood 
that the small number of subjects, large variability and many measurements near the LOQ prevented 
further model refinement. Goodness-of-fit-plots are missing but not requested because the platform 
was not qualified for prediction of CYP3A4 interactions. Due to the above mentioned issues, the 
meaningfulness of the PBPK analyses is considered limited. Therefore, the potential impact of CYP3A4 
is also reflected in the PI (SmPC section 4.5). 
A further study was presented, not primarily designed as interaction study, which also evaluated the 
potential for interaction with ursodeoxycholic acid, which is the standard therapy in patients with PBC, 
in which population this study was conducted as a phase 2 study. With regard to the influence of 
maralixibat on UDCA kinetics, only inconclusive results were obtained. This study is characterised 
rather as a PD interaction study (maralixibat potentially preventing absorption of UDCA), rather than a 
PK interaction study (see below).  
In conclusion, while the potential for PK interactions appears also expected to be low based on the low 
plasma concentrations, a fully conclusive elucidation of the interaction potential on the local level of 
intestine has not been presented. This is addressed in the product information. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Maralixibat (formerly known as SD-5613, SHP625, and LUM001; hereafter referred to as maralixibat) 
is an inhibitor of the apical sodium–bile acid transporter (ASBT.) This transmembrane protein 
transporter, localised on the luminal surface of ileal enterocytes, is present in the terminal 25% of the 
small intestine and mediates uptake of conjugated bile acids across the brush border membrane of the 
enterocyte. Maralixibat is a potent ASBT inhibitor (IC50 = 0.3 nM) as demonstrated in cell-based 
assays.  
Maralixibat is minimally absorbed due to its large molecular weight (710 Da) and the presence of a 
positively charged quaternary nitrogen atom, therefore maximizing the local exposure of the molecule 
to its target and minimizing unnecessary systemic exposure. Maralixibat-mediated blockade of 
intestinal reabsorption of bile acids by ASBT interrupts the enterohepatic circulation, thereby increasing 
fBA excretion and lowering sBA levels (see the following figure). 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 48/123 
 
 
 
Figure 3 Interruption of Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile Acids by Maralixibat 
As obvious, the primary mode of action is by blocking the (re-)absorption of bile acids. The intent is 
clearly that by blocking the reabsorption, the substance would lead to a decrease of pathologically 
increased endogenous bile acids in the serum. The use in disorders with a high serum level of bile acids 
is therefore obvious.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics in Healthy Adult Participants 
Pharmacodynamic effects in humans were already tested in non-diseased subjects in the early studies 
NB4-02-06-002, NB-02-06-003, and also in Study SHP625-101, which was conducted in obese, but 
otherwise healthy subjects. 
In healthy subjects, a decrease of serum bile acids was seen, which appeared to be dose-dependent 
with modest correlation and consistent only at doses higher than 2.5-5 mg. The missing clear 
correlation to the doses administered could potentially be explained by the high influence of food 
intake as well as the counteracting mechanisms of increase of bile acid synthesis as measured e.g. be 
biomarkers, such as Serum 7αC4 which was consistently increased. An increase of faecal bile acid 
excretion was also detected in a clearer dose-dependent manner, and was detected at all doses 
administered across studies, and without relevant differences between single and multiple 
administrations, however with high variability between subjects. In addition, a consistent increase in 
faecal weight was seen, with small increases and a tendency for increased number of bowel 
movements and liquid stool consistency. In healthy subjects, changes in serum lipid parameters were 
rather modest, but detectable (e.g. LDL decrease). The studies do provide a clear proof of the concept 
of reducing serum bile acids by inhibiting the reabsorption within the endogenous bile acid recycling.  
In study NB4-02-06-002, a total of 82 subjects received single oral doses of maralixibat ranging from 1 
mg to 500 mg or placebo. Profiles of sBA and fBA prior to and following dosing with maralixibat or 
placebo served as pharmacodynamic markers. The changes of bile acids serum concentrations are 
shown in the following figure.

maralixibat or placebo served as pharmacodynamic markers. sBA levels were assessed on Days 1 and 
14, and similar to the single ascending dose data, suppression of basal sBA as well as postprandial 
increases was observed on Day 1. Suppression of sBA increased with increasing doses. In contrast, on 
Day 14, the effects of higher doses appeared to be attenuated (pooled 10 to 100 mg doses showed 
greater suppression on Day 1 vs. pooled 1 to 5 mg doses but this was not apparent on Day 14).

In study SHP625-101, the pharmacodynamics of maralixibat was assessed in overweight and obese 
participants (body weight > 63.5 kg and mean body weight 91 kg). Maralixibat at doses of 10 mg once

daily, 20 mg once daily, 50 mg once daily, 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice daily, or matching 
placebo, was administered for 7 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was fBA; sBA was included as 
a secondary endpoint. Mean fBA change from baseline increased in all participants who received 
maralixibat and increased with increasing total daily dose. The greatest mean change from baseline in 
total sBA concentration at Day 7 was an increase of 2.571 (2.3099) ng/mL observed in subjects who 
received placebo. In contrast, no significant change in mean sBA from baseline was demonstrated in 
this population. 
Pharmacodynamics in Paediatric Participants with Cholestatic Disease 
PD properties were further evaluated in studies with different disease as the target population, with 
study NB4-02-06-014 conducted in adolescents with hypercholesterolaemia, study LUM001-401 in 
patients with PSC, study LUM001-201 in adult patients with PBC, and in various studies in children 
suffering from Alagille Syndrome (LUM001-301 to LUM001-305). 
For patient populations with “modest” cholestasis only, such as patients suffering from PBC or PSC, 
rather modest decreases of serum bile acids were detected, but in both populations effects were also 
seen with regard to a reduction of pruritic symptoms, and increase in 7-alpha-C4, as well as for a 
reduction of LDL-cholesterol. Because these studies were also designed as phase 2 studies, the 
disease-specific parameters (biomarkers) such as bilirubin and ALP (as well as transaminases) were 
also investigated, but no relevant effects on these could be detected. 
In study NB4-02-06-014 serum bile acids were also partly reduced in adolescent patients with 
hypercholesterolaemia, although some inconsistencies were found, obviously due to the low doses 
administered (highest dose 5 mg). There was a clear tendency for lowering of LDL-C, except in the 
lowest dose group (0.1 mg) 
Further studies have been conducted with the compound in patients with hypercholesterolemia, 
evaluating mainly the effects on lipid parameters. In one of these studies (Study NB4-01-02-035-ASR) 
pharmacodynamic effects of the compound with regard to bile acid reduction and serum lipids in 
different diet regimens has been investigated. It could be shown that PD activity increases with 
increasing caloric content, as well as with increasing fat content, both for (most of) the serum lipids, as 
well as for serum bile acids. Further studies in this patient population (BATAHC-0524-037 and 038) 
have investigated whether a “sustained release” mimicking intake of small doses distributed over the 
day would (in order to assure a more constant blocking of the bile acid transporter) be able to deliver 
higher changes in serum bile acids and lipid parameters. This was obviously not the case in these 
studies, which can be considered relevant for the proposed once daily dosing also proposed for the 
ALGS population.  
Finally, in this population, a full factorial design study was conducted in order to see whether 
combination treatment with statins would make sense. In this study, while modest effects with 
monotherapy with maralixibat on LDL-C were detected, there was no additional effect when given with 
atorvastatin. 
One study (Study LUM001-501) was presented for the previously proposed indication PFIC2. In this 
study, the primary outcome parameter was serum bile acid concentrations over time, but this could 
not achieve statistical significance at the time-point of primary evaluation, also clinical relevance could 
be questioned. Relevant reductions of sBAs could be shown for this population in the long-term 
extension study, which, however appeared to be overall flawed with relevant number of patients not 
responding to treatment excluded in the long-term. Overall, the observed effects appeared to be 
somewhat smaller in magnitude as compared to what was documented in Alagille’s population.

Pharmacodynamics in the target population: 
The 5 studies presented in the target population (see also efficacy assessment), children with Alagille 
Syndrome (LUM001-301, LUM001-302, LUM001-303, LUM001-304, LUM001-305) were treated with 
maralixibat with various doses. The results of the trials showed a decrease of serum bile acid 
concentrations, but with some fluctuations between doses and over time. For the final assessment it is 
referred to the clinical efficacy evaluation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The applicant has not conducted any dedicated studies on the potential for effects base on secondary 
pharmacology. The applicant, however, indicates that e.g. the QT prolongation potential has been 
evaluated and presents data from the food interaction study MRX-102 which has extensively recorded 
and analysed ECG data. Study MRX-102 appears to include sufficient data to exclude a potential for QT 
prolongation, when considered together with the available pre-clinical information, and the safety 
margins calculated.  
PD interactions 
The applicant has not conducted any PD interaction studies. However, the study as above with 
atorvastatin (NB4-00-02-006), as well as the study in patients with PBC (LUM001-201) could also be 
regarded to represent PD interaction studies. 
For atorvastatin, no additional effects on plasma lipids were detected (as seen above, and obviously no 
indication for PD interaction exists). 
For the study in PBC patients, the potential for PK interaction was evaluated, but did not yield 
conclusive results, potentially due to an incomplete evaluation of UDCA (sparse sampling only, no 
consideration of endogenous UDCA conjugated and unconjugated UDCA). In similar way, no 
conclusions appear to be possible when looked at the PD parameters ALP, bilirubin, and liver 
transaminases. Whether the potential for UDCA interaction has been sufficiently evaluated, however, 
appears to be questionable. UDCA interaction might be relevant for the target population, in as many 
patients with ALGS are concomitantly treated with UDCA. An appropriate reminder for this potential 
interaction has been implemented in the PI (SmPC section 4.5). 
In conclusion, the PD properties of the compound have been sufficiently investigated, and overall 
adequately characterised. By inhibiting bile acid absorption, the compound increases the faecal 
excretion of bile acids, thereby inducing the potential for gastrointestinal effects (increase stool weight, 
increased stool frequency and diarrhoea). By blocking (re-)absorption of endogenous bile acids, the 
compound is able to reduce serum bile acids in healthy subjects, as well as in a variety of disease 
states, including the severe cholestatic childhood diseases such as ALGS and PFIC. The reduction of the 
endogenous bile acid pool induces an obvious increase in the production of bile acids, as measured by 
appropriate biomarkers in healthy volunteers as well as in patients. This mechanism, however, can be 
considered less relevant in patients with highly pathological serum bile acid levels where levels below 
(upper limit of) normal are not achieved. In addition, the compound induces a modest improvement in 
serum lipid parameters (e.g. decrease in LDL-C) which might be based on both the bile acid 
sequestrant effects, as well as the reactive increase of bile acid production. However, these effects 
appear not relevant for the target population of ALGS but is nevertheless considered reassuring. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The present MAA concerns maralixibat chloride (hereafter maralixibat), an oral inhibitor of the apical 
sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) for the treatment of Alagille’s Syndrome (ALGS), a rare 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 52/123 
 
 
 
multi-system inherited disease, which includes cholestatic liver disease in children. Maralixibat is a 
selective ASBT inhibitor small molecule with limited systemic exposure and a molecular weight of 710 
Da and harbouring a positively charged quaternary nitrogen atom. Maralixibat inhibits BA reabsorption, 
thereby increasing faecal bile acid (fBA) excretion and lowering serum bile acid (sBA) levels. The 
recommended dose is 380 μg/kg of maralixibat once daily with a starting dose of 190 µg/kg once daily 
to be administered for one week.  
The investigations with regard to clinical pharmacology of the compound reflect two basic facts on the 
compound: 
- 
Maralixibat is very poorly absorbed, and measurable plasma levels are only observed in a 
minority of subjects, both in healthy subjects, as well as in a variety of disease states. 
- 
Maralixibat has a long history of development with multiple changes of sponsors, and multiple 
changes of the envisaged target populations. This is reflected in a variety of (diseased) populations 
included not only in the PK, but also in the PD investigations (with some of the studies presented as PD 
studies, originally intended as early (Phase 2) development studies. 
These facts explain to a relevant part the scope and extent of the studies conducted. 
Already early in the development, it was clear that the compound hardly develops measurable plasma 
concentrations. Therefore, the restricted investigation of the overall PK and the retrospectively 
addressed factors of the characterisation of PK, such as volume of distribution, the influence of 
demographic characteristics on PK are acceptable. PD properties with regard to interactions at the local 
level in the GI tract (with respect to enzymes and transporters playing a role in transmembrane 
transport or metabolisation) and interactions potentially affecting the target population (e.g. fat-
soluble vitamins, UDCA) were not evaluated in full but could be addressed in adequate warning 
statements included in the PI.  
While some dose-finding studies in the target population have been performed, the dosing schedule, 
including the proposed once daily dosing (regular dose), as well as the intake with or without or timely 
distance to food intake have not been systematically evaluated and/or deduced from data. The 
proposed weight-based dosing in children with ALGS 2 months of age and older is acceptable, as 
already tested in the clinical studies.  
Overall, the low levels of plasma concentrations do indeed provide a high level of reassurance that the 
compound is largely devoid of systemic (off-target) actions which is supported by the results of all 
investigations conducted both in healthy volunteers, as well as in patients. 
The applicant has thoroughly investigated the primary pharmacodynamic targets of IBAT inhibition, 
which extends from bile acid sequestration (increase in content of bile acids in the faeces) and a 
reduction of serum bile acids (which only become obvious at higher doses in healthy subjects) to the 
further consequences of this primary action: increase in faecal weight, stool frequency, and potentially 
diarrhoea at the local level, induction of bile-acid synthesis in healthy volunteers (as measured by the 
biomarker 7-alpha-C4), and a modest improvement of the serum lipid profile (LDL reduction, HDL 
increase, triglyceride decrease). The induction of bile acid synthesis could regularly be detected in 
patients with normal levels of serum bile acids by increases in 7-alpha-C4, and by a consequential 
decrease of FGF-19 and FGF-21. However, in patients with cholestatic disease, this has not always 
been observed, or has not been investigated in all studies conducted. 
Although the potential for drug-drug interaction appears to be low, and systemic interactions seem to 
be very unlikely or have partly been investigated (and excluded), the applicant has not fully addressed 
the potential for local interactions in the gastrointestinal tract with substrates of OATP1B2 and CYP3A4, 
and UDCA, or with fat-soluble vitamins or other food components with bile-acid dependent absorption. 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 53/123 
 
 
 
However, the interaction potential with vitamins/food components has been evaluated in the safety 
assessment. The issues has been addressed with including respective warnings in the PI (see above). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package consists of a large number of studies. Due to the low absorption of 
maralixibat, PK parameters were not calculable with the doses employed in paediatric patients. The 
basic PK and PD properties of the compound have been adequately characterised. The dossier is 
considered approvable from a clinical pharmacology perspective. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the target indication 6 study reports in patients with ALGS of 1-23 years of age (5 from 
completed clinical studies and one from historical comparison) have been submitted. Key evidence on 
efficacy has been provided from the pivotal phase 2 Study LUM001-304. Additionally, with the 
responses to the Day 180 LoOI, interim data from study MRX-801 in infants of 2-12 months of age was 
submitted to support the extension of the indication to this age group. 
In addition, an EAP for patients with ALGS was opened in September 2020 in selected European 
countries, the United States, Canada, and Australia and as of 18 February 2022, has enrolled over 50 
additional participants treated with maralixibat. No data relevant for efficacy have been made 
available.  
Efficacy assessments across the studies was mainly focused on treatment effects on the key PD 
parameter of maralixibat – sBA and the key symptom in ALGS – pruritus. Further, liver enzymes and 
bilirubin, xanthomas, growth, and quality of life were evaluated.  
In total efficacy database is limited to 86 patients of 1-23 years of age and 6 patients of 2-10 months 
of age. Summary table with the studies relevant for ALGS indication is presented below

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The proposed dosing regimen is a starting dose of 200 μg/kg maralixibat (190 µg/kg free base) once 
daily, followed by an increase to 400 µg/kg (380 µg/kg free base) once daily after 1 week. The 
maximum dose to be applied is 28.5 mg maralixibat (base) QD per day, calculated as 380 µg/kg/day 
maralixibat (base) or the equivalent 400 µg/kg/day maralixibat chloride (referred to as “maralixibat” 
throughout this report) for a 70 kg person. Weight-based dose adjustment is proposed. The drug is to 
be taken before (up to 30 minutes) or with a meal in the morning.  
Features of the studies testing various doses of maralixibat in ALGS population are summarised in the 
figure below. 
Figure 5 Study Designs for the Maralixibat Alagille Programme 
The proposed therapeutic dose has been tested in the LUM001-304 study (short and long-term 
treatment, 1-23 year olds) and in the MRX-801 study (short-term effects; interim data in infants). The 
LUM001-304 study showed significant difference on maralixibat compared to placebo Efficacy and 
safety of this dose is discussed further in the document. 
The supporting Studies LUM001-301 and LUM001-302 used lower doses of maralixibat (70 to 280 
µg/kg once daily). These studies did not show significant difference to placebo in respect to reductions 
in pruritus and sBA. Numerical differences to placebo were observed on lower doses (70 µg/kg/day and 
140 µg/kg/day). Within Studies LUM001-301 and LUM001-302, a dose response relationship was not 
shown; this was attributed to the relatively small sample size, placebo-effect, staggered treatment 
groups recruitment, suboptimal dosing, and the impact of outliers.  
The long-term extension (LTE) Studies LUM001-303 and LUM001-305 used doses of 280 µg/kg once 
daily with an increase to 280 µg/kg twice daily after Week 124 permitted for participants in Study 
LUM001-303. These long-term open-label studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
in pruritus and sBA at most time points in the overall maralixibat population with associated 
improvements in quality of life and height z-score over time.  
Starting dose of 200 μg/kg maralixibat once daily and quick dose escalation to 400 µg/kg once daily 
after 1 week is proposed. The simplified dose escalation is based on the safety data from the

maralixibat early access programme (EAP) in 37 participants (age range 1-27 years) with ALGS (34 
being treatment-naïve) and on MRX-801 study (8 infants with ALGS). In EAP average treatment 
duration (SD) was 231.5 (101.02) days. No deaths, or drug-related SAEs have been reported as of 18 
February 2022 in the EAP. Of the 37 participants who received maralixibat, 16 participants (43.2%) 
experienced TEAEs and 6 (16.2%) drug-related TEAEs (transaminitis [Grade 3], 2 cases of elevated 
LFTs [Grade 1 and 2], emesis [Grade 1], 2 cases of diarrhoea [Grade 1]). The drug-related events led 
to dose modification (in 3 cases), treatment interruption (1 case – elevated LFT), and treatment 
discontinuation (in 1 case – transaminitis). Interim data from MRX-801 are summarised in the section 
if clinical safety of this report and show that no discontinuations due to the tolerability issues took 
place. The data are still preliminary and very limited. 
The proposed weight-based dosing for paediatric patients is suggested to account for the increase in 
average length of the small intestine with age from birth through 20 years (Weaver et al. 1991) that 
follows a similar curve to that of weight growth.  
Weaver et al., 1991 analysed reported measurements of small intestinal length from eight published 
reports describing necropsy specimens of female and male subjects (pre-natal phase and after birth 
various ages). Subjects with congenital gastrointestinal and cardiac disease have been excluded. The 
lengths of 1010 specimens were plotted against the lengths or heights of the subjects. To establish the 
relation between intestinal length and body length or height, the data were fitted by cubic spline 
regression. The spline curve was fitted to both the original data and to the log transformed data. In the 
latter case, the slope of the regression curve indicated the power relation between small intestinal 
length and body length. 
Analysis showed that after birth, growth in intestinal length continued during early postnatal life, but 
from about 1 year (75 cm body length) onwards it slowed and remained linear with increasing age to 
adulthood. From birth there was a wide range in intestinal lengths reported, with 100% variation from 
early childhood onwards. 
For fully grown patients, a weight-based dosing should no longer be followed. The proposed dosing for 
patients with a body weight of ≥70 kg is 28 mg once daily (400 µg/kg * 70 kg).  
All ALGS patients included into the clinical studies were children and majority had body weight below 
50 kg at study entry. There have been 9 participants who reached ≥18 years of age during the studies 
and continued on maralixibat treatment, with the oldest participant currently 23 years of age as of 22 
February 2022. Some patients reached body weight above 50 kg during long-term treatment (3 
patients in LUM001-304, 1 in LUM001-303 and 4 in LUM001-305).  
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
Title of Study: Long-Term, Open-Label Study with a Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 
Randomized Drug Withdrawal Period of LUM001, an Apical Sodium-Dependent Bile Acid 
Transporter Inhibitor (ASBTi), in Patients with Alagille Syndrome (ICONIC) 
Methods 
This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, drug-withdrawal study with a long term open-label (OL) 
extension in children with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
maralixibat (MRX). The study comprised an 18-week OL run-in period (OL phase), a 4-week 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug-withdrawal period (randomised withdrawal phase; 
RWD), a 26-week stable-dosing period at doses up to 400 μg/kg/day (after randomised withdrawal 
phase; ARW), and an optional long-term treatment period (long-term extension phase; LTE).

or nutritional intervention; surgical disruption of the enterohepatic circulation; liver transplant, 
decompensated cirrhosis (alanine transaminase [ALT] >15× ULN, INR >1.5, albumin <3.0 g/dL; 
history or presence of clinically significant ascites; variceal haemorrhage, and/or encephalopathy); 
history or presence of other concomitant liver disease, or history or presence of any disease or 
condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, 
including bile salt metabolism in the intestine, history or presence of gallstones or kidney stones; 
administration of bile acid or lipid-binding resins within 28 days prior to screening and throughout the 
trial; participants weighing over 50 kg at screening or any other conditions or abnormalities which, in 
the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, may compromise the safety of the participant, or 
interfere with the participant participating in or completing the study.  
Treatments 
The proposed therapeutic dose of 400 µg/kg/day (QD) was applied after careful titration of maralixibat 
from 35 µg/kg/day via the dose steps of 70 µg/kg/day, 140 µg/kg/day and 280 µg/kg/day (for 1 week 
each). Placebo arm was included in the RWD phase. During the long-term treatment period, 
participants may have had their dose of maralixibat increased to a maximum of 800 μg/kg/day (400 
μg/kg twice daily [BID]), based on efficacy (serum bile acid (sBA) levels and Itch Reported Outcome 
(Observer) (ItchRO[Obs]) score) and safety assessments. In all cases, maralixibat, or placebo were 
administered orally, 30 min prior to the main meal of the day. 
Objectives 
The objectives of this study (up to and including Week 48) were: 
• To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of maralixibat  
• To evaluate the effect of maralixibat on sBA levels  
• To evaluate the effect of maralixibat on biochemical markers of cholestasis and liver disease  
• To evaluate the effect of maralixibat on pruritus  
• To evaluate the long-term effect of maralixibat during 48 weeks of treatment 
The objectives of the optional long-term follow-up treatment period (after Week 48) were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 61/123 
 
 
 
• To offer eligible participants treated in the LUM001-304 study continued study treatment at 
Week 48 until the first of the following occurred: 1) the participants were eligible to enter 
another maralixibat study, 2) maralixibat was available commercially, or 3) the sponsor 
stopped the programme or development in this indication 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint of the study was Mean change from Week 18 to Week 22 of fasting sBA levels in 
participants who previously responded to maralixibat treatment, as defined by a reduction in sBA ≥50% 
from baseline to Week 12 or Week 18 (mITT Population). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints were 
• The change from Week 18 to Week 22 in: fasting sBA, Pruritus as measured by ItchRO (ItchRO[Obs] 
and ItchRO[Pt]), liver function tests (ALP, ALT, total and direct bilirubin) (ITT).  
• The change from baseline to Week 18 in: fasting sBA, Pruritus as measured by ItchRO (ItchRO[Obs] 
and ItchRO[Pt]), liver function tests (ALP, ALT, total and direct bilirubin) (ITT) 
Additional Efficacy Endpoints 
• Responder analysis at Weeks 18, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 100 in: Pruritus response rates as 
measured by ItchRO (ItchRO[Obs] and ItchRO[Pt]) and CSS. 
• Change from baseline to Weeks 18, 22, and 48 and then every 12 weeks in: fasting sBA, Pruritus as 
measured by ItchRO (ItchRO[Obs] and ItchRO[Pt]), liver function tests (ALP, ALT, total and direct 
bilirubin), other biochemical markers of cholestasis (total cholesterol, LDL-C), Bile acid synthesis 
(7αC4)  
Change from baseline for PedsQL, PIC, CIC, CGTB, Xanthoma scale score, height, weight, over the 
whole treatment period (run-in, randomised withdrawal and follow-up phases). 
Sample size 
The planned sample size of 30 evaluable ALGS subjects was based on practical considerations, rather 
than a desired power for a pre-specified difference  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The study included open-label and double-blind phases. 1:1 randomisation in the RWD phase was 
applied. Patients were stratified as per their response in the run-in phase. 
Statistical methods 
In the LUM001-304 the following analysis populations were planned: 
•  Safety Population (SAF): The Safety Population is defined as all subjects who were enrolled 
and received at least one dose of the study drug. 
• 
Intent-To-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT Population includes all subjects who were enrolled 
and received at least one dose of the study drug. 
•  Modified Intent-To-Treat Population (MITT): The MITT Population includes all subjects who 
were enrolled, received study drug through Week 18, and had a reduction from baseline in sBA 
of ≥50% at the Week 12 or Week 18 measurement (sBA responder). Notably, definition of 
responder was adapted after completion of the RWD phase.  
For each treatment phase, the following subjects were included in each respective analysis population: 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 62/123 
 
 
 
−  OL Phase: Subjects dosed during the OL phase. 
−  RW Phase: Subjects randomised and dosed during the RW phase. 
−  ARW Phase: Subjects dosed after the RW phase. 
The primary analysis population for efficacy was the MITT Population. Analyses for the primary and 
secondary efficacy outcome variables were also performed on the ITT Population.  
The difference between treatment groups in change from Week 18 to Week 22 in serum bile acid were 
evaluated using an ANCOVA model with treatment group as a factor, and Week 18 serum bile acid as a 
covariate. An ANCOVA model that includes the stratification variable sBA responder indicator as an 
additional covariate was also performed on the ITT Population. This model also included the sBA 
responder covariate by treatment sequence interaction term. The LS mean difference between 
treatment groups (MRX minus PBO) with standard error, 95% CI for the LS mean difference, and p-
value for testing if the treatment group LS means are equal were calculated to determine if the change 
in sBA levels between the treatment groups are statistically significant. 
Secondary, exploratory, and other efficacy variables that are continuous measures were analysed 
similarly to the primary efficacy analyses, using summary statistics and, with the exception of PIC, 
CIC, and CGTB, by ANCOVA.  
Efficacy measures that are categorical binary responder outcomes were analysed using the chi-square 
or Fisher’s Exact test, as appropriate based on sample sizes.  
No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.  
For subjects who early terminated from the study prior to Week 100 or are otherwise missing Week 
18, Week 22, Week 48, and/or Week 100 data were imputed in a LOCF approach. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Thirty-six children with ALGS were screened between October 2014 and August 2015, at which time 
the predefined sample size was filled. Five participants were excluded during the screening period. In 
total, 31 participants were enrolled into the open label period of the study.  
A total of 28 participants completed the core study to Week 48, and 14 participants were receiving 
maralixibat in the LTE at the time of transition to the rollover LTE Study MRX 800 in May 2020.

Figure 7 Study Drug Exposure Over Time by Participant (Safety Population) – 
Study LUM001-304 
As indicated in the figure above, the majority of participants increased the dose to 400 µg/kg twice 
daily under Protocol Amendment 5, and after Week 100 of the study. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 7 countries (Australia, France, Spain, Poland, United Kingdom) and 10 
clinical sites. Majority of the patients were recruited in the EU. The study centres were mainly hospital-
based paediatric centres specialised in liver diseases. Two-thirds of the study participants were 
enrolled in Australia or France (about 30% in each). 
First participant was screened on 28 October 2014 and last subject last visit took place on 28 May 
2020. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in conformity with the GCP rules, Declaration of Helsinki, CIOMS and other 
applicable rules, regulations and guideline. In total 6 protocol amendments were introduced. Key 
changes being changes in inclusion-exclusion criteria (limitation of allowed body weight, exclusion of 
patients with renal and hepatic stones, etc.), change in the responder definition for randomised 
withdrawal phase for definition of mITT, and addition of extension phases. EC and regulatory approvals 
for the sites have been submitted.  
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics of the participating patients are displayed in the table below. The study 
included 1 to 15 years old children with ALGS distributed over all age categories. All had confirmed 
JAGGED1 mutation and suffered from chronic cholestasis. Delay in height and weight growth was also 
apparent (z-scores of -1.7 (1.34) and -1.7 (1.18) respectively). Mean values of the sBA and liver 
function parameters were high at the baseline. However, 9 patients had normal or only slightly 
elevated levels of sBA at the baseline.

Numbers analysed 
The safety set included 31 patients. Efficacy analysis was conducted in 29 patients (ITT; 13 on MRX 
and 16 on PLA). The primary analysis included 15 patients (mITT; 5 on MRX and 10 on PLA). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Change in Serum Bile Acid (Primary Efficacy Endpoint – mITT Population) 
There was a statistically significant LS mean (SE) difference in change from Week 18 to 22 in sBA 
between the maralixibat and placebo groups (-117.28 [52.828] μmol/L, p=0.0464). Participants 
administered placebo during the RWD phase had a statistically significant LS mean (SE) increase in 
sBA from Week 18 to Week 22 of 95.55 (30.488) μmol/L (p=0.0086), whereas those who received 
maralixibat had no notable change (-21.73 [43.125] μmol/L, p=0.6234). 
Change in Serum Bile Acids Over Time (Prespecified Endpoint - Overall Study Population) 
In the overall ITT Population (N=31 participants), with all participants randomised to either placebo or 
maralixibat during the RWD phase, there was a significant mean (SE) decrease in sBA during the OL 
phases up to Week 18 (-87.73 [22.280] μmol/L, p=0.0005, N=29) and Week 48 (-96.44 [32.068] 
μmol/L, p=0.0058, N=27). 
At the end of the RWD phase (Week 22), participants who had continued to receive maralixibat 
maintained their mean (SE) sBA treatment effect (-16.73 [30.412] μmol/L, p=0.5923, N=13), whereas 
those on placebo had experienced a significant increase (93.58 [33.219] μmol/L, p=0.0130, N=16). 
The LS mean difference between the 2 treatment groups was statistically significant (-113.95 μmol/L, 
95% CI -212.68 to -15.21, p=0.0254).

Group Through Week 48 in the Overall Study Population (ITT Population); Study LUM001-
304 
ITT=intent-to-treat; MRX=maralixibat; PBO=placebo; sBA=serum bile acid; SE=standard error of the 
mean. 
Notes: Vertical reference lines indicate the period during which study participants received either 
placebo or maralixibat; during all other treatment periods all study participants were treated with 
maralixibat.  
Throughout the entire treatment period statistically significant decreases from baseline in sBA were 
observed at each time point, with the exception of Week 108 and Weeks ≥240. After Week 22, at the 
visits with statistically significant results, mean (SE) decreases from baseline in sBA after 
Week 22 ranged from -83.71 (32.915) µmol/L at Week 100/LOCF (p=0.0170) to -180.84 (47.672) 
µmol/L at Week 204 (p=0.0020). The results at Week 108 and ≥240 may be explained by a smaller 
number of participants on study medication at those visits (N=13 and <5, respectively). 
After Week 100, 14 of 16 participants remaining in the study, who had sBA levels above the ULN (8 
µmol/L) or pruritus (ItchRO(Obs) ≥1.5) increased maralixibat doses of 800 µg/kg/day (400µg/kg BID). 
Five of these patients had additional reduction in sBA on the BID dose. 
ItchRO(Obs) Weekly Average Morning Severity Score 
At Week 22, a statistically significant increase (worsening) in mean (SE) change from Week 18 in 
ItchRO(Obs) scores was identified in the placebo group (1.712 [0.2513], p<0.0001, n=16), whereas 
no relevant change was observed in the maralixibat group (0.201 [0.2180], p=0.3754, n=12). 
Participants who received placebo experienced a return of their pruritus severity similar to their 
baseline scores, whereas those who continued to receive maralixibat generally maintained the 
treatment effect observed during the OL phase. 
At comparison of the ItchRO(Obs) scores at the end of the RWD phase (Week 22) mean (SE) values 
were 1.380 (0.2685) vs. 2.839 (0.2126) in the maralixibat and placebo groups, respectively. The LS 
mean (SE) difference between the maralixibat and placebo groups at Week 22 was statistically 
significant (-1.483 [0.3103]; p<0.0001).

Notes: Area shaded in red indicates the period during which study participants received either placebo or 
maralixibat; during all other treatment periods all study participants were treated with maralixibat. An ANCOVA was 
used to test for a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups and statistically significant 
difference from baseline in both treatment groups combined. Analysis was performed on the ITT Population. 
Improvements in pruritus were maintained as per ItchRO(Obs) over the extension period as well. A 
responder analysis performed using different responder definitions that were based on changes in 
ItchRO(Obs) weekly average morning severity score responder rate of >70% at Week 48, as defined 
by change from baseline of ≥1.0 point. Clinically relevant responder rates were observed using 
increasingly conservative response thresholds. At the end of the placebo-controlled RWD phase at 
Week 22, there was a consistently higher proportion of responders in the maralixibat group compared 
with those in the placebo group, using various responder criteria.  
A post hoc analysis of pruritus response evaluating days of pruritus control as determined by 
proportion of days with an ItchRO(Obs) score of 1.0 or lower in any given week showed an increasing 
proportion of days with pruritus control on maralixibat. At Week 18, participants had pruritus control 
44.8% of days. At the end of the RWD phase, the proportion of days with pruritus control dropped to 
6.2% in the placebo group while it was maintained at 41.7% in the maralixibat group, suggesting the 
maralixibat-driven pruritus control. Pruritus control was observed 42.9% to 51.7% of days during 
Weeks 28 to 48 with only 1 participant discontinuing during this study period.

Other parameters 
Changes in CSS score were in line with the changes in the ItchRO(Obs). No relevant changes were 
observed in bilirubin and other liver parameters. Quality of life, cholesterol, xanthoma and Z-scores for 
height and weight improved over the whole study period. However, no changes after switch to placebo 
were reported in the quality of life.

Ancillary analyses 
To account for the drop-outs in the follow-up phase of the study, sensitivity analyses applying 3 
different imputation methods (BOCF, MMRM and multiple imputation) were conducted for sBA and 
ItchRO(Obs) parameters to assess the maintenance of effects. Even with the most conservative BOCF 
method, changes from baseline to weeks 48 and 204 were found statistically significant.  
To account for natural fluctuations in sBA post hoc analyses of changes in sBA were conducted against 
adapted baselines applying two values prior to treatment (screening and baseline visit) and prior to 
randomised withdrawal in LUM001-304. Treatment effects on sBA were smaller than in the main 
analysis, but statistically significant for run-in and randomised withdrawal phase.  
Study in infants – MRX-801 study 
Design and methodology: This is an ongoing open-label, multicentre, Phase 2 study to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of maralixibat in the treatment of infants (≥ 2 months to <12 months old) with 
cholestatic liver disease (Alagille syndrome [ALGS] or progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
[PFIC]). 
The study comprises screening (up to 4 weeks), core study period to Week 13 and long-term extension 
(LTE). 
Evidence of efficacy was provided in 8 patients of 2 to 10 months of age with ALGS change in pruritus 
as assessed with Clinician Scratch Scale (where 0=none and 4=cutaneous mutilation, haemorrhage 
and scarring evident) at week 13 was mean (SD; median; range) -0.2 (1.91; -1.0; -3.0 to 3.0) and in 
sBA mean (SD; median; range) -88.91 µmol/L (113.348; -53.65; -306.1 to 14.4). Two patients 
experienced improvement in both pruritus and sBA. 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Title: Long-Term, Open-Label Study with a Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Drug 
Withdrawal Period of LUM001, an Apical Sodium-Dependent Bile Acid Transporter Inhibitor (ASBTi), in 
Patients with Alagille Syndrome (ICONIC) 
Study identifier 
LUM001-304 
EudraCT number: 2013-005373-43 
ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02160782 
Design 
This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, drug-withdrawal study with a long 
term open-label (OL) extension in children with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of maralixibat (MRX). The study 
comprised an 18-week OL run-in period (OL phase), a 4-week randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled drug-withdrawal period (randomised 
withdrawal phase; RWD), a 26-week stable-dosing period at doses up to 400 
μg/kg/day (after RWD - ARW), and an optional long-term treatment period 
(long-term extension phase; LTE). During the long-term treatment period, 
participants may have had their dose of maralixibat increased to a maximum 
of 800 μg/kg/day (400 μg/kg twice daily [BID]), based on efficacy (serum bile 
acid (sBA) levels and Itch Reported Outcome (Observer) (ItchRO[Obs]) score) 
and safety assessments.  
Duration of OL run-in phase: 
18 weeks 
Duration of RWD phase:  
4 weeks 
Duration of ARW phase: 
From Week 22 Up to Week 288

sBA (ITT) 
All 31 participants treated with MRX in OL. 
The difference between treatment groups in 
change from Week 18 to Week 22 in fasting 
sBA levels was evaluated using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
group as a factor, and Week 18 sBA as a 
covariate. The analysis used a tabulation of 
fitted summary statistics from ANCOVA in 
the mITT population, including all enrolled, 
who received study drug through Week 18, 
and had a reduction from baseline in sBA of 
≥50% at the Weeks 12 or 18. 
The P-value for testing if the treatment 
group least squares (LS) means were equal 
was calculated. 
The difference between treatments in change

Detailed description of the study designs and key study characteristics of all studies relevant for 
efficacy is provided above. 
Placebo-controlled studies – LUM001-301 and -302 
Changes in sBA were selected as either primary efficacy endpoint (Studies LUM001-302) or secondary 
efficacy endpoint (Study LUM001-301) in all placebo-controlled studies, given the importance of sBA as 
an objective PD biomarker and its critical role in the pathogenesis of cholestasis and cholestatic clinical 
manifestations. Pruritus was also selected as clinical parameter as either the primary (LUM001-301) or 
key secondary endpoint (LUM001-302 and LUM001-304) in all placebo-controlled clinical studies in the 
programme. Assessment of pruritus was done by means of a specifically developed Clinical Outcome 
Assessment tool to assess pruritus in ALGS (ItchRO, versions for observer and for patients over 9 
years of age) and a clinician scratch severity score (CSS). 
Additional efficacy endpoints related to cholestatic liver disease in ALGS and representing the overall 
disease burden were also evaluated: xanthomas, growth impairment, and fatigue, serum markers of 
liver disease (bile acids, ALT, bilirubin, ALP). Impact on quality of life and fatigue were assessed by 
means of specific paediatric quality of life questionnaire (PedsQL, including fatigue dimension). 
Because ALGS is a rare disease, the sample sizes for the clinical studies were determined for practical 
reasons, and no specific sample size calculation was performed. Main statistical analyses were 
prespecified in their respective study SAPs. A number of sensitivity analyses (pre-specified and post 
hoc were also conducted). The main population for efficacy was the mITT Population in all studies.  
In the dose finding studies LUM301 and -302 it was defined as all subjects from the ITT Population 
receiving at least one dose of treatment and having at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment 
(Itch Reported Outcome (observer instrument) average daily score, or sBA, depending on the study).  
In these studies the primary analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints - change from baseline to 
Endpoint (Week 13/ET) in pruritus as measured by ItchRO(Obs) or in mean sBA (in LUM301 and -302 
Assessment report

respectively) - were based on an ANCOVA model with treatment and baseline average scores of the 
respective efficacy parameter as covariates.  
Secondary and exploratory efficacy variables were analysed similarly to the primary efficacy analyses. 
The following doses of maralixibat - 70 mg/kg, 140 µg/kg, 280 µg/kg once daily (QID) – were tested 
against placebo. In all cases, the drug was titrated very slowly, starting with 14 µg/kg/day and 
escalating up-to the respective targeted dose via the dose steps of 35 µg/kg/day, 70 µg/day and 140 
µg/day (1 week per dose step). After titration of study medications treatment was kept stable. 
No change in baseline therapies was allowed.  
The entry criteria for the patients were similar to those in the main study. 
Long-term extension studies – LUM001-305 and -303 
Primary objective of these studies was to provide evidence of maintenance of effects and of safety of 
maralixibat on long-term treatment. Patients from the preceding -301 and 302 studies were enrolled. 
Statistical analysis and efficacy parameters remained the same as in the preceding studies. Doses of 
280 µg/kg QD and BID was tested in these studies. Changes in concomitant medication were allowed. 
Cross-study comparisons – Results 
Populations included into the placebo-controlled studies were roughly similar at baseline. 
Key efficacy outcomes across the studies is presented in the tables and figure below.

Week refers to the week within the listed study. The baseline refers to the last value prior to receiving MRX. For 
Study LUM001-304, the shaded area indicates the period during which study participants received either PBO or 
MRX; during all other treatment periods all study participants were treated with MRX. For Studies LUM001-303 and 
LUM001-305, participants who received MRX within studies LUM001-302 and LUM001-301 (respectively) have 13 
additional weeks of exposure (the duration of 301/302 not shown) to MRX than the week listed. 
Long-term observations showed maintenance of effects in majority of the parameters. Post hoc 
sensitivity analyses accounting for use of concomitant medications, drop-outs, confirmed that the 
effects on sBA and ItchRO(Obs) were maintained over long-treatment period of at least 2 years 
duration on 400 µg/kg/day dose in LUM001-304. 
No relevant changes were observed in bilirubin or other liver parameters in overall population. Post hoc 
analysis in the small group of patients (N=15) from LUM001-304 with considerable sBA reduction 
showed improvement in the levels of bilirubin. 
Comparison with external control (GALA) 
A natural history comparison study was conducted to compare disease outcomes between 2 groups of 
patients with ALGS:  1) maralixibat treated study participants and 2) patients who are ASBTi naïve

from a natural history global clinical research database (GALA). The GALA clinical research database is 
recognised internationally by academic and tertiary referral liver transplant centres, with a high level of 
participation. The GALA clinical research database includes clinical and laboratory data as well as 
disease outcomes.  
Long-term outcomes associated with maralixibat treatment were assessed by comparing event-free-
survival (EFS) (composite endpoint of first event of liver decompensation [ascites, variceal bleeding], 
SBD, liver transplantation, and death) in maralixibat-treated participants with ALGS to a selected 
external control cohort of patients from the GALA clinical research database. The maralixibat clinical 
study data included in this natural-history comparison comprised the aggregated data from all 
maralixibat-treated participants from the long term maralixibat ALGS programme (N=84), with follow 
up data up to 6 years. GALA clinical research database controls were selected based on prespecified 
criteria similar to those from MRX studies. In addition, patient selection was limited to regions in which 
the maralixibat studies were conducted: North America, Europe, and Australia. 
A patient may have been eligible with multiple visit time points. The best visit to represent baseline 
equal to the start of follow-up was aligned with maralixibat ALGS studies was selected by maximum 
likelihood methods. The balance between the maralixibat cohort and the GALA control group had to be 
established before selection was considered completed and before effects of treatment on the outcome 
events were described. 
This natural-history comparison followed a prespecified SAP, and its primary analysis was the 
comparison of the time to first clinical event between the maralixibat-treated participants (maralixibat 
cohort) and the GALA control group.  
Depiction of the time to first occurrence of events was performed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In 
addition, the HR estimate of the treatment comparison with 95% CI was calculated with Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis that included age, sex, baseline bilirubin, baseline ALT, and 
treatment as factors. The appropriateness of the proportional hazards model was assessed. 
Pre-specified and additional post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the primary analysis and subgroup 
analyses were conducted.  
A total of 490 patients, with 3906 visits, were included in the analyses in the GALA control group. 
Baseline characteristics generally demonstrate balance between the maralixibat cohort and GALA 
control group, with no statistically significant imbalance in the baseline covariates. Importantly, 
bilirubin, GGT, and ALT were well balanced. Median sBA was higher in the maralixibat cohort; however, 
sBA data were limited in the GALA clinical research database (approximately 85% do not have sBA 
measures) since sBA are not sampled regularly on a clinical basis, often only at a single time point in 
some patients (at entry into the database), and not longitudinally.

b Death information was collected from public records (deaths occurred at 2, 7, 9 months and 3.5 years after study 
discontinuation), no further information was available. 
Reasons for liver transplantation and death were provided. There were 5 deaths reported in the 
maralixibat cohort; 1 related to liver disease (decompensation events of ascites and hepatic 
encephalopathy preceded death); the other 4 remain unknown as these participants had discontinued 
the study and the investigators were not able to obtain/provide the reason for death. Also, among the 
reasons for transplantation, a number of cases might not had been triggered by cholestasis/liver 
disease. 
The time to clinical event (SBD, liver transplantation, liver decompensation, or death) in the 
maralixibat cohort was delayed compared with the GALA control group (Figure). 
In the primary analysis (with adjustments for age, sex, bilirubin, and ALT), EFS was statistically 
significantly higher in the maralixibat cohort compared with the GALA control group (HR=0.305; 95% 
CI:0.189-0.491; p<0.0001), indicating a 70% improvement in EFS with maralixibat treatment. 
Figure 11 Kaplan-Meier Plot for Event-Free Survival –Maralixibat Cohort versus GALA 
Control Group: Primary Analysis 
To consider the impact of different clinically meaningful parameters such as age, sex, serum levels of 
total bilirubin, ALT, GGT, region, and year of birth, Cox regression analyses were performed with 
adjustment for different combinations of these parameters.  
The time to clinical events depends on the baseline definition. This can be defined as the first, last, or a 
random visit or date of birth. Sensitivity analyses using different baseline definitions (prespecified as 
well as post hoc) all confirmed that EFS in the maralixibat cohort was prolonged compared with the 
GALA control group.

Given potential differences in standard of care between regions and centres, subgroup analyses were 
conducted for specific regions, including North America, Europe, and Australia, to address any such 
differences. In addition, a subgroup analysis was conducted between overlapping centres. Results 
showed consistency with the primary result, suggesting that differences in standard of care did not 
have an impact on the result of improved EFS with maralixibat. 
The immediate events in the GALA control group shown in the Kaplan-Meier curve may be suggestive 
of an immortal time bias. Pruning analyses for comparison of EFS that excluded patients who had 
events in the first 3, 6, or 12 months confirmed significant improvement in EFS with maralixibat 
treatment. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Initially, the target indication proposed for Livmarli was treatment of cholestatic liver disease in 
patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 1 year of age and older. To support this indication 6 study 
reports (5 from completed clinical studies and one from historical comparison) were submitted, 
including the data from 86 patients with ALGS of 1-17 years of age and body weight of under 50 kg. 
The efficacy database is, thus, very limited. Additionally, few data in children who reached adult status 
and weight over 50 kg were submitted. Given the rarity of the disease limited size of the population is 
however acceptable.  
Key evidence on efficacy has been provided from the pivotal phase 2 long-term Study LUM001-304.  
Supportive evidence is derived from two phase 2 clinical dose-finding studies (LUM001-301 and 
LUM001-302) and their open-label (OL) long-term follow-up studies (LUM001-303 and LUM001-305). 
Additionally comparative analysis of long-term observations from the above clinical studies in ALGS 
and the natural history data from an external GALA clinical research database (GALA-MRX-ALGS) has 
been submitted, as well as few safety data from the EAP and children below age of 1 year as a support 
of the proposed starting dose of 200 µg/kg QD. 
Studies LUM001-301 and -302 were similar studies testing the 70 µg/kg/day (only in LUM001-301), 
140µg/kg/day and 280 µg/kg/day QD doses of maralixibat in the ALGS patients. In the LUM001-304 
(core study) currently proposed therapeutic dose of 400 µg/kg/day QD maralixibat was applied. 
The positive feature of the LUM001-304, -301 and -302 studies is that these were double-blind, 
randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies in the population that can be considered 
representative of the target indication. LUM001-301 and -302 had a parallel-arm design with the 
duration of 13 weeks, whereas key efficacy evidence (on the therapeutic dose of 400 µg/kg/day) was 
collected in the LUM001-304 during an 18 weeks-long active run-in followed by a 4-week long 
randomised withdrawal phase. Generally, parallel-group design is preferable to a randomised 
withdrawal design, as the latter does not allow for usual comparison of efficacy between treatments, 
extrapolation of the treatment effects to the general population is difficult, as analyses is usually 
limited to the “enriched” population, and as unblinding and carry over effects may confound the study 
outcomes. In the case of LUM001-304, the risk of carry-over is regarded negligible, given the quick 
removal of maralixibat from the body and its local mode of action. All patients completing the run-in 
phase were subjected to randomised withdrawal and only 2 patients were excluded from the efficacy 
analysis (ITT), which suggests that the tested population remained not enriched.  
Duration of all 3 studies was short (max 13 weeks), so that the data allow to evaluate only short-term 
effects of maralixibat. Notably, double-blind phase of the LUM001-304 study was 4 weeks long only, 
that is too short to draw conclusions on the maintenance of “withdrawal” effects over prolonged time 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 85/123 
 
 
 
period. This is considered a limiting factor in the assessment of the drug efficacy, as the RWD phase is 
the only phase in the presented clinical development programme providing placebo comparison for the 
proposed therapeutic dose of maralixibat.  
All 3 placebo-controlled studies were small in size and planned without sample size calculation. This is 
not surprising, given the rarity of the disease. Overall, all 3 studies are regarded as exploratory and 
adequate studies for testing proof of concept and short-term maralixibat effects, but not to provide 
confirmatory evidence on efficacy for the initially targeted indication treatment of cholestatic liver 
disease in patients with Alagille syndrome. 
Efficacy assessment was focused on evaluating maralixibat effects on sBA, pruritus, liver enzymes and 
bilirubin, xanthomas, growth, and quality of life. All efficacy parameters are regarded relevant and are 
accepted. However, key parameters are sBA and pruritus, given the finally targeted indication of 
cholestatic pruritus. sBA is the key PD parameter for maralixibat and is assumed to play a key role in 
the pathogenesis of the disease, in the development of pruritus, as well as progressive liver 
impairment. Pruritus is one of the main, most burdensome and difficult to manage symptoms of ALGS, 
that commonly requires surgical treatment (including liver transplantation). These 2 parameters were 
chosen as a primary or secondary endpoints in all studies to test short and long-term efficacy of the 
drug. There is a link between the effects on sBA and effects on cholestatic pruritus. Consequently, 
reductions in sBA, if these are accompanied with improvement in pruritus, can be regarded supportive. 
Maintenance of effects and the long-term treatment effects were evaluated in the long-term open label 
single arm settings of the extension phase of LUM001-304 and extension studies to LUM001-301 and -
302 - LUM001-303 and LUM001-305 - over a time period of up-to 6 years. In these studies also dose 
escalation up-to 400 µg/kg/day (follow-up phase of LUM-001-304) was also allowed. Overall, duration 
of the long-term studies is considered adequate to characterise maintenance of effects. However, 
interpretation especially of subjective parameters as pruritis is difficult in the absence of a placebo 
control and presence of multiple confounders.  
For the initially targeted indication, “treatment of cholestatic liver disease”, ultimate long-term 
objective of prevention or delay of development of liver impairment, and of surgical interventions, such 
as biliary diversion procedure or liver transplantation due to intractable pruritus or progressed liver 
impairment, on treatment with maralixibat would be expected. It was hypothesised, that these effects 
are possible if stable and clinically relevant suppression of sBA levels and improvement in pruritus can 
be achieved. Due to the absence of an internal long-term control arm, the applicant conducted a 
comparison with an external historical control, that contains the patients from an ALGS registry 
(GALA). The efficacy of maralixibat on the clinically relevant hard endpoints was assessed by 
comparing event free survival (EFS) (composite endpoint of first event of liver decompensation 
[ascites, variceal bleeding], SBD, liver transplantation, and death) in maralixibat-treated patients 
against the external control patients from the GALA clinical research database. A prospective, pre-
specified SAP was generated before patient selection or analysis was initiated.  
Generally, comparisons against historical control are considered problematic. There is an inherent risk 
to natural history comparisons that certain unknown factors may have contributed to the results and 
could not be taken into consideration in the analysis. In addition, comparisons with external controls 
are susceptible to selection bias, which can unlikely be fully accounted for. Most importantly, presence 
of data on sBA was apparently not the major inclusion criterion. In the absence of the baseline 
information on sBA (i.e., the key PD parameter and the pathophysiological factor in ALGS progression), 
assessment of comparability of the patient cohorts is not possible and differences in the treatment 
effects cannot be assigned to changes in this parameter.

Overall, to summarise, there was a number of relevant uncertainties detected in the methodology, 
which limited the value of the external comparison as supportive evidence for the claimed indication 
(see below). 
With the response to the Day180 AR the applicant proposed to adapt the indication to “treatment of 
cholestasis in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older”. However, no pivotal 
new data have been submitted to substantiate the indication of “cholestasis”. Basically, some of the 
data, which were presented previously in >1 years old, had been picked and summarised as new (sBA, 
cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, xanthomas, pruritus, fatigue, z-score for growth), whereas others, not 
less relevant tests (e.g., direct bilirubin, liver function tests), had been disregarded. Also, sensitivity 
analyses were presented accounting for confounders (e.g., concomitant treatments, concomitant 
conditions, drop-outs, etc.).  
In agreement with the applicant the indication was further adapted to “treatment of cholestatic 
pruritus in patients with ALGS”. 
To support the extension of the indication to infants, interim short-term treatment data (up-to week 
13) on CSS and sBA in 8 patients (age 2 months and older) from an ongoing open-label study MRX-
801 have been presented. These data have exploratory character and are considered limited. However, 
based on similar effects on sBA and pruritus in the older population extrapolation to the youngest 
population was accepted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-finding and the proposed dosing regimen 
The proposed dosing regimen is a starting dose of 200 μg/kg maralixibat (190 µg/kg free base) once 
daily, followed by 400 µg/kg (380 µg/kg free base) once daily after 1 week. The maximum dose to be 
applied is 28.5 mg maralixibat (base) QD per day, calculated as 380 µg/kg/day maralixibat (base) or 
the equivalent 400 µg/kg/day maralixibat chloride for a 70 kg person. Intake of the medication is 
recommended up-to 30 min prior to and during a meal, orally.  
The doses of 70 µg/kg/day (only in LUM001-301), 140µg/kg/day and 280 µg/kg/day were tested in the 
parallel-group studies LUM001-301 and -302 and showed inconsistent and partly inverse dose-
response relationship.  
The applicant conducted an exploratory dose-response analysis, that did show difference to placebo in 
terms of treatment effects on sBA, but no clear dose-response relationship was observed. Although the 
conducted analysis was considered somewhat flawed, as known confounders such as the changes in 
the relevant concomitant treatment, were not considered, the proposed dose regimen was accepted 
based on its use in the study LUM001-304.  
Weight-based dosing is based on the assumption, that increased length of intestines translates into 
higher number of the target receptors for maralixibat in the gut. As the length of the intestines 
increases with age (up-to the adulthood) and height, and, since height and weight in children 
correlate, the applicant considers weight-based dosing plausible and appropriate. This rationale cannot 
be fully supported, as due to the lack of information (e.g., on correlation of the number of targeted 
receptors with the length of bowels in ALGS, correlation of height and weight with the length of 
intestines in ALGS) no proper assessment can be made. Moreover, high variability of up-to 100% has 
been reported in the length of the intestines in the same-aged/same-height population. Considering 
the above, individual dose-selection, based on efficacy and tolerability in individual patients, may be 
more reasonable approach in this patient population. However, given that the key data on efficacy are 
collected with 400 µg/kg/day and limited evidence has been collected on lower doses, 400 µg/kg/day 
appears acceptable as a therapeutic dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 87/123 
 
 
 
There is uncertainty around the adequacy of the proposed dosing in the infants, given the non-linear 
character of the growth of intestines in children below the age of 1 year. However, low systemic 
exposure reported in study MRX-801 is reassuring in terms of potential systemic off-target effects.  
For the cases of poor tolerability, temporary reduction of dose, or treatment interruption has been 
recommended in the SmPC, which is agreed 
In contrast to the slow titration regimen with low starting dose of 35 µg/kg/day in the studies, a two-
step titration scheme starting with 200 µg/kg/day dose is being proposed, based on the experience in 
37 patients (including 34 maralixibat naïve subjects) from the ongoing EAP, which showed good 
tolerability of this starting dose and fast titration regimen. The same dosing regimen has also been 
tested in infants with acceptable tolerability. It can be agreed that the data suggest overall good 
tolerability of the 200 µg/kg/day maralixibat as a starting dose.  
It is agreed that 800µg/kg/day dose should not be recommended as a therapeutic dose, as there is 
very limited evidence supporting this dose and that an increased number of abdominal pain, vomiting 
and diarrhoea were reported on the 800 µg/kg/day regimen compared to 400 µg/kg/day. Also, 
pronounced and gradual elevation of mean ALT was observed with 800 µg/kg/day. In conclusion, dose-
finding has not been comprehensively done, but the presented data allow to conclude, that the 
proposed dosing regimen is overall acceptable.  
Evidence of efficacy – short-term effects (LUM001-301, -302 and run-in and RWD phases of the 
LUM001 -304) 
Based on the presented evidence the following conclusions can be made: 
The double-blind study LUM001-301 was formally a failed study that failed to demonstrate statistically 
significant effects in the primary evaluation, change from baseline in pruritus (scores of ItchRO(Obs)). 
However, the results indicate activity of the compound based on the numerical differences observed, 
especially with regard to the changes in itch scores and quality of life. These results are somewhat 
questioned with a paradoxical inverse dose-response relationship favoring the lowest doses used. 
Contrary to the itch and QoL scales, no relevant changes were detected for the changes in bile acids 
(as well as other liver markers), and the inverse dose-response is also seen for this parameter. 
The explorative study LUM001-302 did also not meet its primary endpoint, the change in sBA and the 
high dose did not show a clinically relevant effect, while reduction of sBA compared to placebo was 
seen in the lower dose group. The changes induced for the secondary endpoint “itch” did not show 
overall statistically significant effects, and also an inverse dose-response relationship. A combined 
analysis of itch- and sBA-based responses, however, showed higher responder rates for the active 
treatment groups, especially when the most stringent response criterion was chosen. The evaluation of 
Quality of Life demonstrated effects of the active treatment over placebo, which was again, more 
pronounced in the low-dose treatment group. 
The main study LUM001-304 studied the proposed 400 µg/kg/day maralixibat dose in the target 
population against placebo, although in a randomised withdrawal (RWD) setting with only a short (4-
week) placebo-controlled phase. The primary endpoint was analysed in the mITT population (defined 
as patients with at least 50% reduction in sBA at weeks 12 or 18 in the run-in phase as compared to 
the baseline at enrollment). The study was – in conjunction with the supportive studies – finally found 
to provide sufficient evidence for the ability of the compound to reduce sBAs and symptoms of 
cholestasis. 
Overall, the study population was heterogeneous, but relatively balanced across the treatment arms in 
respect to the baseline at the study entry. In regards to the baseline prior to the RWD phase, the 
treatment groups differed. However, post hoc sensitivity analyses with adapted baseline prior to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 88/123 
 
 
 
RWD showed statistically significant changes on each treatment indicating clear differentiation between 
treatment effects. Further, normal or only slightly elevated levels of sBA (below the level of 100 
µmol/L, e.g. 20.2 µmol/L) and bilirubin were reported in about 30% of the study population at 
enrollment. Potential impact of these mild cases on study outcomes remains unclear.   
Overall, it can be agreed, that the study population is representative of the general population with 
ALGS. Overall, the study was a “positive” study as, after randomised withdrawal, patients on 
maralixibat maintained their reduction in sBA and pruritus (ItchRO(Obs and Pt) and CSS), whereas 
worsening was observed on placebo with parameters almost returning to the baseline levels. Restart of 
maralixibat treatment in the placebo population again lead to improvement in these parameters. 
Similar changes on MRX vs placebo were observed for other parameters, such as cholesterol, LDL-
cholesterol, and fatigue. Positive effects were maintained up-to the week 48. Sensitivity analyses 
provided by the applicant to account for the high variability in sBA values, use of concomitant 
treatments, presence of concomitant conditions, drop-outs up-to week 48, yielded results for sBA, 
pruritus (ItchRO(Obs)), cholesterol, and xanthomas that were consistent with the main analyses and 
can be considered reassuring. These data are convincing.  
In the study MRX-801, limited efficacy data in 8 infants with ALGS of age of 2 to 10 months have been 
collected. The data suggest that 2 of 8 patients showed positive effects of MRX such as decrease in sBA 
and pruritus (as assessed with CSS). In one patient these were accompanied by improvements in liver 
function tests (e.g., ALT, total bilirubin). Limitation of this study is lack of a comparator and very small 
sample. However, in the vulnerable population included no study with placebo control would be 
deemed ethical. Also, the small size of the population is justified, given the rarity of the disease. Since 
reduction in sBA was accompanied with improvement in pruritus in the “responder” patients, and 
effects of MRX on sBA are considered established in older ALGS population, extrapolation of placebo-
controlled data on pruritus to infants with ALGS is considered acceptable.  
Long-term treatment and maintenance of effects 
Maintenance of effects and long-term treatment effects were characterised in the OLE of the LUM001-
304 study, in the study LUM001-305, that was the extension of LUM001-301 and in LUM001-303, that 
was the extension of LUM001-302 study.  
Key parameters sBA and ItchRO(Obs) showed maintained effects over prolonged (over 5 years) 
duration of time, but the data are burdened with multiple confounders (high fluctuations in sBA, use of 
concomitant treatment, dose escalation to non-therapeutic dose of 800 µg/kg/day). Furthermore, only 
a minor proportion of the patients completed the single arm, open label long term follow-up, which 
further introduces uncertainties to the long-term effect. The applicant has presented sensitivity 
analyses utilizing various imputation methods to account for the drop-outs, use of concomitant 
treatments, fluctuations in the sBA. These analyses, all point towards maintenance of effects on sBA 
and ItchRO(Obs) during the first 1 and 2 years of treatment (that excludes the data on escalated dose) 
in one part of the treated population. These data are sufficiently convincing to support the claim of 
long-term treatment effects on these two parameters. Seen in the light of the above-mentioned 
methodological issues, uncertainties still remain with regards to the maintenance of effect. Further 
effectiveness data will be gathered post-authorisation by means of a long-term safety and clinical 
outcomes study that is made specific obligation of this marketing authorisation. Furthermore, the 
applicant has agreed to collect full 1-year treatment data in infants with ALGS (MRX-801 study). The 
patients will be advised to continue treatment in the study for at least 1 year instead of switching to 
compassionate use programs, or to commercial product once the commercial product becomes 
available on the market. Further, the company will submit the final report of the MRX-800 study by 
end of 2023 as stated in the RMP which will provide additional evidence of efficacy.

There was no change in liver function tests overall in the studies, all of which were pathologically 
elevated at baseline. This sheds doubt on the benefits of the treatment with regard to the preservation 
of liver function in the long-term. Thus, the data do not support the claim of “treatment of cholestasis”, 
but they are considered sufficient to substantiate the indication “treatment of cholestatic pruritus”. No 
long-term data exist on pruritus in the infant ALGS population. However, there is no reason to believe, 
that maintenance of effect would differ from that in older children.  
Long-term treatment effects – clinically relevant hard endpoints (comparison vs. external control) 
When regarding the survival analysis against an external control (GALA cohort), at first sight, the 
selected external cohort appears to be roughly similar to the maralixibat cohort. However, only 73 
patients from GALA database had sBA available in the external control chosen and baseline values of 
sBA in this small control group differed significantly from the maralixibat cohort (p=0.003). As the 
positive effects of maralixibat on sBA (and ALGS) are hypothesised to result in long-term clinically 
relevant benefits on hard clinical endpoints giving proof of a disease modifying effect, presence of 
baseline information on sBA to gain some assurance on the adequacy and comparability of the selected 
external patient cohort, would be considered necessary. Value of the survival analysis (including 
multiple sensitivity analyses) in the total population of 469 patients from GALA is therefore questioned.  
Further, from the methodological perspective comparison with the GALA population is considered 
problematic. The selection mechanisms for including patients in a clinical trial and a patient registry are 
fundamentally different, and there are serious doubts that this can be compensated by accounting for 
confounders by adjustment or matching based on the information available in the registry as the 
assumption of no unmeasured confounding is unlikely to be fulfilled.  
Although it is reassuring that 65% of GALA patients were initially diagnosed at participating centres, 
there is still potential that the remaining patients were referred to the centres due to worsening of 
disease. The exact reasons for transfer are not available. 
Follow-up of patients from GALA was considerably shorter than for MRX-treated patients although the 
applicant claims that GALA patients had similar year for index time. The reasons are not entirely clear. 
Thus, there is a concern of bias due to differential drop-out and potential informative censoring. 
Balance regarding confounding factors at index date would be of questionable relevance when balance 
was lost soon after index date because of differential drop-out. 
Regarding the management of patients, no detailed information is available on concurrent therapies in 
GALA. It is agreed with the applicant that comparison restricted to centres contributing to GALA and 
MRX studies is of particular importance because these can be assumed to use the same standards. 
However, this comparison was not adjusted for centre because of small sample sizes per centre. 
Furthermore, as the applicant claims that patients selected as controls from the GALA registry and 
patients treated with MRX were at the same age, diagnosed during the same years and were aimed to 
be balanced regarding baseline characteristics, the question arises why some patients in these centres 
were included in the MRX studies while others were not, i.e. there is potential for residual confounding. 
The applicant acknowledges that individuals in the GALA control group for whom providers might 
anticipate that transplant/surgical biliary diversion/death is inevitable and imminent would not be 
included in clinical studies; despite having comparable baseline disease characteristics, these 
individuals theoretically could be sicker or have other factors than the treated cohort at baseline and 
would present an opportunity for residual confounding of disease severity. However, that means, in 
other words, that patients in GALA may not have comparable baseline characteristics but there may be 
factors influencing the risk of an EFS event that are not captured. The applicant argues that pruning 
analysis, which exclude events and person-time up to 12 months from the index time, substantially 
mitigate this concern. This is not agreed. The likely existence of strong confounding factors that are 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 90/123 
 
 
 
not captured is of concern and such factors may still influence the event risk after one year; the size of 
their influence can hardly be quantified. In addition, selection due to the occurrence of events and 
differential drop-out during the first 12 months may take place such that the baseline balance 
regarding confounding factors between the overall groups may not be given for the subgroups of 
patients that are event-free for at least one year. 
To summarise, due to the above listed limitations, the comparison to external controls cannot be 
accepted as pivotal evidence of efficacy to support the indication of “cholestatic liver disease”. 
However, this is not regarded critical, since the indication is no longer pursued and is restricted to 
“cholestatic pruritus” for which sufficient evidence has been provided by the clinical studies conducted. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
The evidence of efficacy is mainly based on a small, single, mostly uncontrolled, open-label trial with a 
4-week randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal phase in patients 1 year and older and on short-
term and open-label data on sBA and pruritus as well as on a limited set of data in infants ≥ 2 months 
of age. In consequence, the treatment effect was demonstrated in a relatively small sample size and 
its precision is therefore naturally low. The absence of a placebo-control for most of the observation 
period further adds uncertainties to the true effect size. The maintenance of effect has been shown up-
to week 48, which can be considered sufficient to estimate long-term efficacy. However, absence of 
placebo control specifically for the subjective and variable symptom of pruritus is acknowledged as 
limitation. Whilst the mechanism of action of the product is clearly described, it remains unclear 
whether the proposed dosing regimen is optimal. Nevertheless, the effect on sBA and pruritus are 
sufficiently large to conclude on a relevant benefit, and endpoints are considered to be clinically 
meaningful, as these capture various aspects of the burden of cholestatic pruritus on the affected 
patients. 
Whilst the benefit risk of the product can be considered acceptable within a marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances (see Benefit risk discussion at the end of the report) above, 
uncertainties need to be balanced by means of the provision of further data post authorisation. 
Accordingly, the applicant will provide further data on long term effectiveness (and safety) of the 
product from a prospective long-term safety and clinical outcomes study (LEAP study). The study will, 
from the efficacy side, monitor maintenance of effect. Furthermore, the applicant will provide yearly 
updates on any new emerging efficacy and safety information becoming available under the scope of 
the annual reassessment.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The currently submitted data package is sufficient to substantiate the targeted indication “treatment of 
cholestatic pruritus” since effects on sBA and pruritus are sufficiently convincing based on the pivotal 
study 304, supported by several open-label studies.  
Extrapolation of efficacy from children >1 years to infants > 2 and to 12 months is accepted, mainly 
based on the PD marker sBA. However, the available data in infants is currently very limited and 
additional data on safety, but also efficacy in the post-authorisation phase, is required. This can be 
provided in post-approval phase via a specific obligation (SOB), which is the mandatory condition for 
the applications under exceptional circumstances. The applicant will conduct and submit the results of 
a safety and clinical outcomes registry-based study in patients with ALGS according to an agreed 
protocol. Furthermore, the applicant will submit yearly updates on any new information concerning the

safety and efficacy of maralixibat, both requirements are made specific obligations to this MA under 
exceptional circumstances. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the

maralixibat. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
Clinical safety for maralixibat in the applied target population with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is 
primarily based on an analysis of safety data from the five studies in paediatric participants with ALGS 
(LUM001-301, -302, -303, -304, -305). Additional preliminary data are provided from the ongoing 
study in children less than 1 year of age (MRX-801; N=6) and from an Early Access Programme EAP 
(N=37) in ALGS. The latter are briefly described in the efficacy section of this report.  
However, data from Study LUM001-304 is proposed as the main source for pivotal safety data. 
The other safety data can be seen as more or less supportive in the applied indication considering the 
underlying relatively similar underlying diseases and the claimed mode of action. 
A short overview about the trial relevant for safety assessment is here provided: 
•  Studies LUM001-301 and LUM001-302 were short term RCTs (13-week, randomised, placebo-
controlled, phase 2 studies) in ALGS subjects 
•  Studies LUM001-305 and LUM001-303 are optional long-term treatment extension studies to the 
LUM001-301 and LUM001-302 studies, respectively, also in ALGS subjects.  
However, the latter 4 studies used lower doses of maralixibat than the proposed therapeutic dose of 
400 μg/kg once daily, since in these Phase 2 studies, participants underwent a dose-escalation period 
to reach their target dose.  
The applied posology was investigated in the pivotal Study LUM001-304, a randomised, placebo-
controlled, 4-week drug-withdrawal study with an open-label, long-term extension, which assessed the 
efficacy and safety of maralixibat at higher doses. In addition, preliminary safety information from the 
ongoing study MRX-801 in children less than 1 year of age treated with the proposed dosing regimen 
(including titration scheme and the therapeutic dose) have been made available with day 180 
response.

Non-clinical trials have identified the following safety issues: 
Nonclinical as well as clinical PK data demonstrate that maralixibat is only minimally absorbed after 
oral administration, is metabolically stable in vivo, excreted almost exclusively in the faeces as intact 
parent drug, and shows low potential for drug-drug interactions.  
Prolongation of coagulation times (rat) and emesis (dog) at doses significantly higher than doses 
required for therapeutic effect in humans, probably due to vitamin K deficiency is noted. 
The applicant concludes from the animal data that emesis and vitamin K deficiency are not significant 
hazards in humans at therapeutic dose levels.  
Moreover, it is correctly argued that dogs are known to be particularly susceptible to emesis, 
potentially contributing to apparent disconnect between those findings in dogs and the clinical 
experience with maralixibat. 
Relatively higher bioavailability (approximately 17%) was seen in the rat juvenile toxicity study testing 
the youngest pups as further detailed in the non-clinical part of this AR and as likely due to the known 
extreme immaturity of the rodent GI tract in neonatal pups. 
The applicant considers the possibility that absorption could be higher in the youngest human patients 
based on juvenile animal toxicity studies.

Note: Percentages are 100*n/N. Treatment groups are based on the highest dose (μg/kg/day) received during 
the analysis period. EAIR is estimated by the number of participants experiencing the AE divided by the 
population-level time at risk in patient-years. 
Any AE determined as possibly related or related, or is missing, is considered as potentially related to study drug. 
The applicant has provided additional more comprehensible information regarding exposure of study 
participants from the ALGS population exposed with the proposed posology (400 μg/kg/day) with the 
response to the D120 list of questions. According to the results it can be confirmed that during the 
clinical trial (most importantly LUM001-304) the study participants were sufficiently exposed to the 
proposed posology (400 μg/kg/day) with an average duration of 536.6 days to allow adequate 
conclusion on safety outcome.  
In addition, it is acknowledged that all participants were additionally exposed to lower doses during 
dose escalations and dose reductions due to AEs for between 35 and 463 days, with an average of 
156.9 days. Also, the proposed dosing regimen (200 µg/kg/day QD 1 week followed with 400 
µg/kg/day QD) is currently being tested in the MRX-801 study in the patients older than 1-12 months 
of age.  
In summary, exposure safety data presented seems to reflect reliably the tolerability of maralixibat in 
the limited number of patients in the target population. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
It is reported that across the studies in the ALGS integrated population, including participants exposed 
to maralixibat and placebo, events of diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain were the most 
commonly reported AEs. This is in accordance with that noted in animals and can be explained by 
maralixibat’s mechanism of action. 
In pivotal Study LUM001-304 events of diarrhoea and abdominal pain were reported in up to 41.9% 
and 41.4% (based on the period of the study) of participants exposed to maralixibat, respectively. 
During the RWD period of Study LUM001-304, those events occurred in 1 participant each in the 
maralixibat (7.7%) and placebo (6.3%) groups. 
In the 13-week, placebo-controlled studies (LUM001-301 and LUM001-302), events of diarrhoea were 
reported in 43.6% vs. 44.4% of participants from the overall maralixibat group and placebo group, 
respectively, whereas events of abdominal pain were reported in 25.6% vs. 16.7%, respectively. The 
majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity, transient in nature, and resolved with no 
action taken with maralixibat.  
In Study MRX-801 in infants, the most frequent TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (50.0%) and abdominal 
pain, diarrhoea, teething, and pyrexia (37.5% each). Overall, 7 participants with ALGS (87.5%) had at 
least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), 2 participants (25.0%) had a TEAE related to study 
drug, and 4 participants (50.0%) had a Grade ≥3 TEAE. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were diarrhoea, Infantile colic, 
pyrexia, crying, Corona virus infection, Varicella, virus infection. One patient had 2 TEAEs related to 
laboratory abnormalities (ALT increased, and AST increased); both were Grade 1 in severity and not 
related to the study drug. Causal relationship of these events to treatment with MRX is difficult to 
establish.  
No AE led to MRX discontinuation as of the data cutoff.

Most common TEAES 
The most common TEAEs (using a threshold of > 10%) observed across the entire maralixibat 
programme (PFIC and ALGS) were from the SOCs of GI disorders, general disorders and administration 
site conditions, and infections and infestations. 
The following preferred terms were reported as most common TEAEs (> 10% overall) in every study 
(derived from ISS Tables 2.1.1.4-2.1.1.6): 
•   Abdominal pain 
•   Cough 
•   Diarrhoea 
•   Headache 
•   Nasopharyngitis 
•   Pyrexia 
•   Upper respiratory tract infection 
•   Vomiting

MRX = maralixibat; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; n = number in a given category; N = 
number of participants; SAE = serious adverse event. 
Note: Percentages are 100*n/N. Treatment groups are based on the highest dose (μg/kg/day) received during the 
analysis period. Participants were counted only once for each System Organ Class and Preferred Term. 
Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 22.1. 
For the overall open-label, long-term extension studies (excluding those recruited in MRX-801), only 3 
(3.6%) participants in the overall maralixibat group experienced treatment-related SAEs; 2 were in the 
maralixibat 280 µg/kg once daily group: 1 (2.6%) participant with an SAE of autoimmune hepatitis, 
and 1 (2.6%) participant with an SAE of ALT increased; and 1 (10.0%) participant was in the 
maralixibat ≤ 140 µg/kg once daily group and experienced an SAE of haematochezia (ISS Table 
2.4.1.3). 
In MRX-801 there were 4 participants (50.0%) who had serious adverse events (SAEs), none of which 
were considered to be related to the study drug. No TEAE led to study drug discontinuation or death. 
The reported SAEs (n=7) included infantile colic and crying in 1 participant, coronavirus infection and 
varicella in 1 participant, 2 events of pyrexia in 1 patient, and viral infection in 1 participant. The SAE 
of crying occurred in the same participant who had an SAE of infant colic 3 months prior. No diagnosis 
for the crying has been provided to date. All SAEs resolved and the maralixibat dose was not changed 
in response to the events. 
No AEs of special interest were reported. 
In the supportive PFIC target population included in study LUM001-501 about half of the participants 
(45.5%) had an SAE. SAEs of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and gastroenteritis were the only events 
(based on PT) that were reported in more than 1 participant (each SAE was reported in 2 participants; 
6.1%). 5 of these SAEs (15.2%, all in 280µg/kg QD) were classified as potentially drug-related. 
However, without sufficient information it seems difficult to evaluate this classification, since drug-
related TEAEs/SAEs are in general difficult to differentiate from disease-associated events due to the 
mainly gastrointestinal adverse events/toxicity of maralixibat. 
No death event occurred during the clinical development in the paediatric population.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Across the ALGS integrated population, mean changes from baseline in most laboratory parameters 
are described as minimal and proposed to show no apparent patterns over time. Moreover, data from 
the long-term extension studies in ALGS did reveal an increase in mean ALT which should be further 
evaluated. 
Haematology: With respect to clinical laboratory evaluations of haematological parameters in both 
populations (PFIC and ALGS) the mean changes from baseline in haematology parameters were 
minimal, short lasting and probably resolved at the next study visit. TEAEs with respect to this class 
were reported in about 3%. During response it was clarified that most of these events are likely to be 
caused by hypersplenism or other adverse events caused by the underlying disease. Serum 
Transaminases and Hepatic Safety: With respect to the hepatic safety, elevations in transaminases 
have been seen in the ALGS development programme for maralixibat that may be a sign of 
hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is an important potential risk outlined in the RMP. 
Fat-Soluble Vitamins, Coagulation, and Lipid Panel: The mean changes from baseline in FSV, 
coagulation, and lipid parameters were also only minimal during the 18-week open-label period of 
Study LUM001-304 in ALGS. After Week 22 in the overall maralixibat group, there was no pattern of 
increasing proportions of participants with abnormalities among these parameters over time. 
Vitamin deficiency, particularly FSV deficiency, is common in children with chronic liver diseases; this 
may be explained by the reduced food intake, impaired nutrient uptake, and reduced synthesis of 
carrier proteins caused by these patients’ damaged liver function. According to literature data the 
incidence of vitamin deficiency could be 20% to 30% in patients with cholestatic liver disease as in the 
target population. However, FSV substitution is normally provided in these population. In order to 
avoid complications this issue has been mentioned in the product information (SmPC 4.4 and PL).  
In infants (MRX_801) episodes of mild increase in INR in one patient (801-802) were observed. 
Vital Signs and Other Safety Evaluations: Changes from baseline in vital signs were minimal in Study 
LUM001-501 and across the ALGS integrated studies and no pattern was identified which could be 
interpreted as a potential signal from the analyses. Moreover, since the drug is not absorbed it seems 
plausible that no concerns for QT prolongation risk following maralixibat administration were raised in 
the clinical programme.  
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
The applicant has provided subpopulation analysis for participants from the ALGS-integrated population 
(excluding the patients from MRX-801 - infants) for the age ranges < 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 
12 years, and 12 to 18 years) and gender subgroups. The analyses of the data did not reveal a specific 
subpopulation to be notable for a preponderance of specific events/increase in severity of a particular 
event. However, the number of patients in these subgroups were notably low, limiting the informative 
value of these analyses.  
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
In the investigated population there was no specific signals regarding adverse events as anaphylactic 
reactions or other suspect events like urticaria indicating an significantly increased allergenic potential 
of maralixibat.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 101/123 
 
 
 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Since maralixibat chemical structure is designed to be minimally absorbed following oral administration 
because the site of action is within the lumen of the GI tract, is metabolically stable in vivo, excreted 
almost exclusively in the faeces as intact parent drug, it seems plausible that the drug has only a low 
potential for drug-drug interactions in general. Moreover, the applicant stated that no safety concerns 
regarding drug interactions with maralixibat were identified during the trials. Thus, it is agreed that, 
considering the very low plasma drug levels for maralixibat at therapeutic doses (often below the 
LLOQ), and also based on in silico modeling and clinical DDI studies, drug interactions with maralixibat 
are unlikely.  
It is agreed that currently there is no evidence that maralixibat has any risk for drug abuse or with 
respect to the ability to drive or operate machinery or leads to an impairment of mental abilities. 
Several cases of drug overdose occurred but were not associated with any TEAEs during the clinical 
development programme. Moreover, there were no apparent treatment-related withdrawal effects 
except for a return of pruritus among participants who stopped treatment with maralixibat. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Review of the safety data for the ALGS integrated population demonstrated that AEs leading to 
discontinuation of maralixibat occurred mainly during the long-term extension period of the studies.  
Of the 39 participants in the 13-week, placebo-controlled studies, 2 participants had an event that led 
to discontinuation; 1 participant (4.0%) in the maralixibat ≤ 140 µg/kg group had an event of ALT 
increased and 1 participant (5.6%) in the placebo group had an event of abnormal behaviour.  
Of the 84 participants in the open-label, long-term extension studies, a total of 13 participants 
(15.5%) had an AE that led to discontinuation.  
ALT increased was the most commonly reported event that led to discontinuation of maralixibat, which 
included 6 participants (7.1%) from the long-term extension studies. Whereas a causal attribution with 
maralixibat was considered for some of these events, the events seem to be rather explained by the 
natural history of the ALGS and progression of the underlying disease from the assessment of the 
details in the response. In particular, since data from the adult population with liver diseases and 
hypercholesterolaemia does also not indicate a potential intrinsic hepatotoxicity. 
No patients discontinued in the MRX-801 study due to an AE. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
The product was approved by the FDA in 2021. No data on post marketing experience were submitted 
within this application. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Maralixibat is a minimally absorbed oral agent that is designed to maximise local exposure of the 
molecule to its target and minimise systemic exposure. 
Safety data in the target population is available from 6 trials (pivotal trial LUM001-304, as well as 
supportive trials 301/302, long term extension trials 303 and 305 and one trial in infants – MRX-801).  
In addition, upon request, the applicant has provided information on maralixibat’s safety from placebo-
controlled RCTs in ~ 1200 adults in a different indication (mainly hypercholesterinaemia). This 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 102/123 
 
 
 
confirmed the risks identified in the paediatric ALGs population and do not indicate additional safety 
signals. 
Exposure 
Maralixibat has been studied in > 1600 participants, but only data from 127 children with cholestatic 
liver disease (n = 33 with PFIC; n = 94 with ALGS) was analysed regarding the safety outcome for this 
submission. Subjects were treated for up to 5 years. During the clinical trials (most importantly 
LUM001-304; excluding MRX-801) the limited number of study participants were sufficiently exposed 
to the proposed posology (400 μg/kg/day) with an average duration of 536.6 days to allow adequate 
conclusion on safety outcome.  
In conclusion, overall exposure and particularly in the applied rare orphan paediatric disease 
population seems in principle acceptable; however limitations due to the small number need to be 
considered.  
In infants (MRX-801) the overall mean (SD, Median) duration of treatment by the data cut-off point of 
May 2022 was 149.0 (50.02; 136.5) days and ranged from 101 to 250 days. This is considered very 
limited. applicant has agreed to collect full 1-year treatment data post-approval in this study. 
Adverse events 
In accordance with the known safety profile of the pharmacological class of ASBT inhibitors GI events 
including diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported adverse drug 
reactions for maralixibat for the applied target-population across the clinical trials.  
In trial LUM001-304 the most frequently reported TEAEs (>40% overall) were abdominal pain 
(58.1%), diarrhoea (54.8%), vomiting and pyrexia (51.6% each), and cough and nasopharyngitis 
(41.9% each). 
Safety data in the paediatric population of ALGS subjects from the 13-week, placebo-controlled studies 
(LUM001-301 and LUM001-302) revealed a similar incidence of events of diarrhoea in the overall 
maralixibat and placebo groups (43.6% vs. 44.4% of participants, respectively), while events of 
abdominal pain were slightly rarer reported in M: 25.6% versus P: 16.7%, respectively. This 
demonstrates that GI symptoms are also likely to be present among the underlying patient population 
of paediatric cholestasis as disease complication.  
Most common TEAEs (> 10% overall) in every study (including long term exposure) were abdominal 
pain (45,5%), cough (34.5), diarrhoea (39.4%), headache (20.7%), nasopharyngitis (34.5%), pyrexia 
(48.3), upper respiratory tract infections (20.7%) and vomiting (37.9%). (e.g. from LUM001-304; ISS 
Table 2.1.3.2.). It has been noted, that “loose stool” was reported as an ADR in various studies 
(including adults), on MRX.  
The majority of these events were described to be mild to moderate in severity, transient in nature, 
and resolved with no action taken with maralixibat and no special approaches for monitoring were 
required. Median time to first onset for events of diarrhoea and abdominal pain was 30 days and 61 
days, respectively. The duration of the gastrointestinal events was short as reflected by a median 
duration for events of diarrhoea and abdominal pain were 2 days and 1 day, respectively. Specific 
mitigation activities for these events included provision of dosing modification guidelines for GI 
symptoms, including diarrhoea and abdominal pain, within the clinical study protocols.  
Regarding symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection as nasopharyngitis, cough and pyrexia it 
needs to be considered that these TEAEs are in general frequent in a paediatric population (simple 
infections during the first 3 years of life, with 71% being respiratory infections, followed by 
gastrointestinal infections according to Vissing et al. 2018).

Preliminary data in infants are difficult to interpret due to low number of patients. Considerable portion 
of patients (50%) had increase in transaminases.  
A more permeable intestinal barrier may occur in situations where the gastrointestinal system is acute 
or chronically disturbed and could lead to higher exposure of maralixibat and potentially induce other 
systemic adverse events particularly in infants. However, in this case, the higher systemic exposure 
has been tolerated in previous human (adults) and non-clinical studies without critical safety findings. 
These data suggest that even if higher exposure levels are reached in infants, these are likely not to 
represent a hazard. It is planned that the patients, especially those under the age of 1 year, are 
closely monitored for safety in the post-authorisation phase (LEAP study). 
SAEs and deaths 
In the pivotal Study LUM001-304, up to 34.5% of participants had an SAE, with the rates varying 
depending on the period of the study. No SAE (based on preferred term) was reported in more than 1 
participant. 
The majority of these SAEs were from the SOCs of Infections and infestations and GI disorders; 
vomiting was the only SAE (based on Preferred Term among the GI disorders SOC) that was reported 
in more than 1 participant (reported in 2 [2.4%] participants).  
The available limited placebo comparison from LUM001-301/302) seems not to indicate a significant 
difference regarding SAEs considering the small numbers of patients involved (LUM001-301 and 
LUM001-302). No specific patterns or safety signals were identified based on review of SAEs. 
From the submitted documents, it was not possible to fully assess the drug-relationship of the SAEs in 
the paediatric populations (PFIC/ALGS); However, it was clarified that drug-relation assessment was 
based on the investigator’s opinion only, based on some acceptable criteria which were provided for 
orientation in the trial protocols.  
Half of the patients in MRX-801 study had 7 SAEs. Notably, proportion of the patients with SAEs and 
the number of SAEs is appears larger in MRX-801 study than in LUM-301/302 and LUm001-304 
studies. No specific patterns or apparent safety signals could, however, be identified based on review 
of SAEs. This phenomenon was contributing to the obvious need for generating more safety data post-
licensing. 
No death event occurred during the clinical development in the paediatric population. 
Laboratory findings: 
With respect to clinical laboratory evaluations of haematological parameters the mean changes from 
baseline described in haematology parameters were small, short lasting and probably resolved at the 
next study visit. TEAEs with respect to this class were reported in about 3%, but details from the 
additionally provided analyses and narratives at day 120 revealed that almost all of these events are 
likely to be not drug related and sufficiently explained due to concomitant hypersplenism caused by the 
underlying disease.  
With respect to the hepatic safety, laboratory data showed probably isolated, asymptomatic elevations 
in ALT in some of the ALGS participants. Whether these events have to be seen as part of the natural 
history of ALGS and were not associated with concomitant rises in bilirubin -as the applicant concludes- 
remains somewhat uncertain at the end. Since the product was also investigated in other indications, 
particularly in hypercholesterolemia, in ~ 1600 adult patients, additional placebo-controlled safety data 
is available and relevant information was provided with the response.  
According to these data it seems unlikely that maralixibat treatment is associated with a high risk for 
drug induced liver injury. However, degree of generalizability of these effects to children (including 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 104/123 
 
 
 
infants) with ALGS is unclear. Since evidence in ALGS population is very limited more data is needed to 
conclude if there is a hepatotoxicity risk with maralixibat or not. If the risk will be confirmed this will 
have an impact on the benefit/risk of the product, accordingly this risk is considered important and is 
as such included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Further characterisation of the potential risk 
of hepatotoxicity via the proposed study LEAP (MRX-310; Long-Term Safety and Clinical Outcomes of 
Livmarli in Patients with Alagille Syndrome) which is made specific obligation of this marketing 
authorisation. Furthermore, the applicant will provide annual updates on new emerging safety and 
efficacy data as part of the specific obligations outlined in this marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances. Also, the applicant will provide data from the ongoing studies MRX-800 and 
MRX-801. This data may help in the clarification of the nature of the hepatic findings in patients with 
ALGS being treated with maralixibat. Also, an open-end post authorisation specific obligation has been 
implemented in which the marketing authorisation holder will give yearly updates on safety and 
efficacy information. Furthermore, a precautionary statement was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, 
to monitor liver function in all patients prior to and during treatment with Livmarli.  
Subgroup analyses: 
The applicant has provided some attempts for subgroup analyses regarding gender and age subgroups 
(< 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to 18 years) and additional data in < 1 year olds. 
In general, they are less informative due to the small number of subjects in the cohorts. Thus, 
differences and potential trends across age groups, including the < 1 year old vs. 1 year and older 
patients remain not interpretable at the end.  
Immunological events: 
No information regarding immunological events was submitted nor was this issue discussed in the 
documents. Animal data indicate the absence of an increased risk for allergic reaction and related 
adverse events as anaphylactic reactions or other suspect events like urticaria are not reported.  
DDI and other potential interactions 
The applicant indicates that, since maralixibat chemical structure is designed to be minimally absorbed 
following oral administration because the site of action is within the lumen of the GI tract, is 
metabolically stable in vivo, excreted almost exclusively in the faeces as intact parent drug, it is 
plausible that the drug has only a low potential for drug-drug interactions in general. Based on the 
safety data to date (01 Dec 2019), no safety concerns regarding drug interactions with maralixibat 
were identified.  
It is agreed that, given the very low plasma drug levels for maralixibat at therapeutic doses (often 
below the LLOQ), and also based on in silico modelling and clinical DDI studies, drug interactions with 
maralixibat are unlikely.  
The impact of maralixibat on absorption of FSV seems not pronounced however -since prophylactic 
substitution was performed during the trial and is generally recommended in the target population- the 
potential need for FSV substitution was included in the product information (SmPC section 4.4).  
It is agreed that currently there is no evidence that maralixibat has any risk for drug abuse or with 
respect to the ability to drive or operate machinery or leads to an impairment of mental abilities. 
Several cases of drug overdose occurred but were not associated with any TEAEs during the clinical 
development programme. Moreover, there were no apparent treatment-related withdrawal effects, 
except for a return of pruritus among participants who stopped treatment with maralixibat. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
In the target population 6 subjects discontinued due to ALT increases assessed as potentially drug-
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 105/123 
 
 
 
related during the long-term extension trial. Overall, this PT was the most frequent AE that led to 
discontinuation in the whole safety population. Even considering the underlying liver disease, 
hepatotoxicity of maralixibat is possible and more data on this important potential risk will be 
generated post-approval as part of the specific obligations as indicated above.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
With a safety database of 86 treated patients, the number of patients is limited. In particular, it is not 
considered possible to draw robust conclusions on safety in relation to potential hepatotoxicity. Whilst 
the mechanism of action of the product is clearly described, it remains unclear whether the proposed 
dosing regimen is optimal.  
It seems unlikely that maralixibat treatment is associated with a high risk for drug induced liver injury, 
but as the evidence provided on clinical safety in the ALGS population is very limited, more data is 
needed to conclude if there is a hepatotoxicity risk with maralixibat or not. As this risk, if confirmed, 
will have an impact on the benefit/risk of the product it is included in the RMP as an important 
potential risk.  
Further characterisation of this potential risk of hepatotoxicity especially but not exclusively in infants 
via the proposed study LEAP (MRX-310; Long-Term Safety and Clinical Outcomes of Livmarli in 
Patients with Alagille Syndrome), is made a specific obligation of this marketing authorisation. 
Furthermore, the applicant will provide annual updates on any new emerging safety and efficacy data 
as part of the specific obligations outlined in this marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Assessment of safety in this application is hampered due to the rare disease nature of ALGS. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events/toxicity as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting are reported to be 
the most common adverse drug reactions, however, may be also caused by the underlying disease. 
Almost all of the TEAEs observed were mild to moderate and resolved with no action taken. 
Maralixibat was in general well tolerated and, considering the low degree of absorption, appears to 
have an acceptable safety profile in paediatric patients with cholestasis due to ALGS. However, a 
significant degree of uncertainty remains, particularly with respect to a potential intrinsic 
hepatotoxicity and, esp. in the patients younger than 1 year of age, due to the limited exposure and 
very limited size of the data base available. The applicant will provide further data on long term safety 
and in particular on potential hepatotoxicity by means of the planned long-term safety and clinical 
outcomes study and give yearly updates on all newly emerging safety and efficacy information on 
maralixibat under the scope of the annual reassessments.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances:

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.9 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 29.09.2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Livmarli (maralixibat) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Target indication for maralixibat is treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome 
(ALGS) 2 months of age and older. 
ALGS is a rare and life-threatening disease with no approved pharmacological treatment for the 
associated cholestatic manifestations which often present in infancy with cholestatic pruritus, abnormal 
liver parameters, failure to thrive, and fat malabsorption. Elevated levels of sBA, bilirubin (especially 
direct) and cholesterol are key components of cholestasis, which are accompanied with clinical 
manifestations, like pruritus, xanthomas, fatigue and disturbance in growth. The accumulation of toxic 
bile acids in the hepatobiliary system damages bile duct epithelial cells and hepatocytes, causing liver 
injury and inflammation, which are manifested in elevated liver function parameters (e.g., ALT). 
Pruritus is reported to be the most bothersome symptom of ALGS across all ages by patients and 
caregivers (Kamath et al. 2018b), which is difficult to treat, leads to cutaneous mutilation, mood 
disturbances, disruption of sleep and school performance, and has negative impact on physical and 
psychosocial health (Elisofon et al. 2010; Kamath et al. 2015, Kamath et al. 2018b), as well as overall 
QoL (Abetz-Webb et al. 2014).  
Progression of hepatic disease occurs in later childhood in many patients. The majority of patients with 
ALGS will either receive a liver transplantation or die, with only 24% to 41% of patients reaching 
adulthood with their native liver (Kamath et al. 2020; Vandriel et al. 2020). Typical indications for liver 
transplant in ALGS include severe pruritus, disfiguring xanthomas, synthetic dysfunction, portal 
hypertension, bone fractures, and growth failure (Lykavieris et al. 2001; Kamath et al. 2020). 
Increased levels of sBA are assumed to mediate pruritus and contribute to liver damage in the ALGS 
population. Maralixibat is able to block reabsorption of sBA in the intestines and reduces sBA in blood. 
It is assumed that decreased levels of sBA lead to improvements in the pruritus, with subsequent 
improvement in the quality of life, and potentially, prolongation of survival with native liver/overall 
survival.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, there are no pharmacological therapies approved to treat cholestasis in ALGS and no 
therapy shown to be effective to improve clinical manifestations of liver disease with subsequent 
prevention or delay in liver transplantation. Certain drugs are prescribed off-label for the treatment of 
cholestatic pruritus or xanthomas, including UDCA, bile acid resins (e.g., cholestyramine), rifampicin, 
and naltrexone, but all have limited or transient efficacy and may have undesirable adverse effects 
(Düll and Kremer 2020). Surgical alternatives are often required. 
Surgical interruption of the enterohepatic circulation has been used to treat cholestasis, 
hypercholesterolemia, and pruritus (Emerick and Whitington 2002; Modi et al. 2007). The most 
common procedure is partial external biliary diversion (PEBD), resulting in a permanent stoma that is 
not effective in approximately half of patients (Yang et al. 2009) and has surgical (e.g., bleeding, 
infections, and surgical complications), medical (e.g., electrolyte disturbances and dehydration) and 
psychosocial complications (Emerick et al. 1999; Kamath et al. 2018b).  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 112/123 
 
 
 
Ultimately, the clinical manifestations of cholestasis, including intractable pruritus can be so severe 
that they are often an indication for liver transplantation (Lykavieris et al. 2001; Mattei et al. 2006; 
Kamath et al. 2018b).  
The management of cholestasis in patients with ALGS remains largely supportive or surgical. Given the 
lack of approved pharmacotherapy, the invasive nature of surgical treatment options, and patients’ 
short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, there remains a high unmet medical need for a 
pharmacological treatment alternative in patients with ALGS that is safe and efficacious to address the 
cholestatic disease burden and improve QoL. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main trials that evaluated the proposed therapeutic dose of 400 µg/kg/day maralixibat in the 
targeted population are LUM001-304 (patients with ALGS 1-15 years of age at study entry) and MRX-
801 (patients with ALGS 2-10 months of age at study entry). LUM001-304 was a randomised, placebo-
controlled, drug withdrawal study with an open-label LTE in participants with ALGS designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of maralixibat. The study consisted of 18 weeks-long open-label run-in 
phase, 4 week-long randomised withdrawal phase and follow-up/OLE phase that lasted more than 
additional 5 years. Placebo control was utilised in the RWD phase only. Overall, 31 patients children 
within the age range of 1 and 15 years (including) were treated and efficacy was analysed in 29 
patients (ITT).  
The recruited patient population was considered representative of the general ALGS population, all 
having confirmed genetic mutation (JAGGED1 in 100%), chronic cholestasis, moderate to severe 
pruritus, increased levels of sBA and liver functional parameters, bilirubin, delayed growth (height and 
weight) and typical non-liver related anomalies (cardiovascular, vascular, facial, etc.). Only about half 
of the patients had xanthoma at baseline and majority had a mild form of it. Absolute majority of the 
patients used medications against pruritus and cholestasis prior to study entry. 
During the study (core part) change in concomitant treatments was not allowed. 
All patients were randomised to maralixibat or placebo in the RWD phase. 
Primary endpoint of the study was the difference in the change in the mean fasting sBA at the end of 
RWD phase compared to the baseline (week 18 before RWD phase) as analysed in the mITT (n=15).  
Key secondary endpoints were the same endpoint on sBA, but analysed in the ITT set and the 
difference in the change in the pruritus (measured by means of ItchRO(Obs)) during RWD (ITT set). 
Maintenance of the treatment effects over 6 years of treatment was also evaluated in this study base 
on the following parameters: sBA, pruritus (assessed by means of ItchRO and CSS), bilirubin and liver 
function parameters, growth parameters (height and weight), xanthoma, cholesterol, quality of life. 
However, no control arm was included.  
MRX-801 is an open-label ongoing study in infants with ALGS with the primary endpoint to assess 
safety and tolerability of MRX in infants. Secondary and exploratory endpoints of the study are 
assessment of MRX effects on sBA, bilirubin, AST/ALT, FSV, ItchRo(Obs), CSS, growth. The study 
utilises the dosing regimen recommended in the SmPC with simplified titration. Only preliminary data 
on sBA and pruritus (CSS) over 13 week treatment period, on PK (sparce sampling) and safety in 8 
patients are available.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
LUM001-304 (age ≥ 1 year and ≤ 18 years) 
Primary endpoint: there was a statistically significant LS mean (SE) difference in change from Week 18 
to 22 in sBA between the maralixibat and placebo groups (-117.28 [52.828] μmol/L, p=0.0464) during 
the randomised withdrawal phase in the mITT set (n=15). Participants administered placebo during the 
RWD phase had a statistically significant LS mean (SE) increase in sBA from Week 18 to Week 22 of 
95.55 (30.488) μmol/L (p=0.0086), whereas those who received maralixibat had no notable change (-
21.73 [43.125] μmol/L, p=0.6234).  
Secondary endpoints: 
Mean changes in sBA over treatment time:  
In the overall ITT Population (N=31 participants), with all participants randomised to either placebo or 
maralixibat during the RWD phase, there was a significant mean (SE) decrease in sBA during the OL 
phases up to Week 18 (-87.73 [22.280] μmol/L, p=0.0005, N=29) and Week 48 (-96.44 [32.068] 
μmol/L, p=0.0058, N=27). 
At the end of the RWD phase (Week 22), participants who had continued to receive maralixibat 
maintained their mean (SE) sBA treatment effect (-16.73 [30.412] μmol/L, p=0.5923, N=13), whereas 
those on placebo had experienced a significant increase (93.58 [33.219] μmol/L, p=0.0130, N=16). 
The LS mean difference between the 2 treatment groups was statistically significant (-113.95 μmol/L, 
95% CI -212.68 to -15.21, p=0.0254).  
Treatment effects on sBA in the run-in and RWD phases was confirmed in post hoc sensitivity analyses 
accounting for intraindividual variability in sBA levels. 
Throughout the entire treatment period statistically significant decreases from baseline in sBA were 
observed at each time point, with the exception of Week 108 and Weeks ≥240. After Week 22, at the 
visits with statistically significant results, mean (SE) decreases from baseline in sBA after Week 22 
ranged from -83.71 (32.915) µmol/L at Week 100/LOCF (p=0.0170) to 180.84 (47.672) µmol/L at 
Week 204 (p=0.0020). The results at Week 108 and ≥240 may be explained by a smaller number of 
participants on study medication at those visits (N=13 and <5, respectively). 
Similar changes were observed in multiple sensitivity analyses accounting for various confounders, 
such as missing data and use of concomitant medication. 
ItchRO(Obs) Weekly Average Morning Severity Score: 
At Week 22, a statistically significant increase (worsening) in mean (SE) change from Week 18 in 
ItchRO(Obs) scores was identified in the placebo group (1.712 [0.2513], p<0.0001, n=16), whereas 
no relevant change was observed in the maralixibat group (0.201 [0.2180], p=0.3754, n=12). 
Participants who received placebo experienced a return of their pruritus severity similar to their 
baseline scores, whereas those who continued to receive maralixibat generally maintained the 
treatment effect observed during the OL phase. 
At comparison of the ItchRO(Obs) scores at the end of the RWD phase (Week 22) mean (SE) values 
were 1.380 (0.2685) vs. 2.839 (0.2126) in the maralixibat and placebo groups, respectively. The LS 
mean (SE) difference between the maralixibat and placebo groups at Week 22 was statistically 
significant (1.483 [0.3103]; p<0.0001). 
Long-term treatment effects on the pruritus were maintained in the patients remaining in the study.

Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and xanthomas: 
Improvements in the levels of cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and xanthomas were observed. The group 
receiving MRX during the RWD phase had a LS mean change (SE) from Week 18 to Week 22 of 2.2 
(21.3) mg/dL (p=0.9167) in cholesterol, whereas those who received placebo had an increase of 78.6 
(19.2) mg/dL (p=0.0004). similar effects were observed with LDL cholesterol. In 14 patients with 
xanthoma at the baseline reduction in xanthoma score mean (95% CI) of -0.4 (-0.9, 0.1) was reported 
at week 18 (p=0.0823) and of -0.9 (-1.3, -0.5) at week 48 (p=0.0006). 
Total and direct bilirubin: 
No clearly positive changes were observed. 
Changes in liver pathology and liver biochemistry: 
No clinically relevant changes were observed. 
Growth: 
Improvement in z-Scores of height was reported. Z-score (95% CI) for height changed by 0.178 (-
0.016 to 0.373; p=0.0704) by week 48 from the mean (95%CI) baseline value of -1.7 (1.34). 
Quality of life: 
Scores of quality of life questionnaire (total and fatigue) improved during run-in and over prolonged 
treatment, but did not show difference to placebo in the RWD. 
CSS: 
Relevant changes in CSS also compared to placebo were observed.  
MRX-801 (<12 months of age) 
sBA: 
The mean (SD) change in sBA from baseline at Week 13 was -88.91 (113.35) µmol/L. There were 
decreases in sBA from baseline to Week 3, 10, and 13. Two of the 6 patients with on-treatment sBA 
measurement had pronounced reduction in sBA. These patients also experienced decrease in bilirubin 
(total and, or direct) and improvement in pruritus. ALT and AST improved in one of these two patients, 
but ALT increased in another. 
CSS: 
The mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 13 for CSS score was -0.2 (1.91) and ranged from -3 to 
3. During the study follow-up, 3 participants had a decrease in their CSS scores (2 of which had no 
pruritus recorded at Week 13 indicating full remission); 1 participant observed no change in their level 
of pruritus, and 3 participants had an increase in CSS score ranging from 1 to 3 points. No post-
baseline value of CSS is available for one patient. Reduction in CSS in two patients was associated with 
reduction in sBA. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties related to the efficacy assessments in the LUM001-304 study originate from the 
following key factors: 
Limited data-set on efficacy of the proposed therapeutic dose (n=29) derived from a single exploratory 
clinical study, that has placebo-controlled phase of only 4 weeks duration; 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 115/123 
 
 
 
Apparent lack of standardisation of the study procedures across participating sites, which might have 
led to high variability in efficacy data, specifically in sBA values. 
High rate of discontinuations/refusal to continue treatment in the follow-up extension phase with 
maralixibat after week 48, that limits robustness of long-term data; Also, data after Week 96 were 
collected on treatment with 800 µg/kg/day, i.e. the dose not proposed as a therapeutic dose. Thus, 
relevant data for 400 µg/kg/day are limited to 48 weeks treatment duration. Effectiveness will be 
further monitored by means of the planned long-term safety and clinical outcomes study that is made 
specific obligation to this marketing authorisation.  
Major part of the study has been designed as an uncontrolled open-label study. This creates an 
uncertainty in interpretation of the data derived from subjective efficacy parameters (like assessment 
of pruritus, quality of life) and those parameters, where natural course of development in this 
particular population is not known (e.g., changes in growth), as it is difficult to isolate the true effects 
of maralixibat treatment, esp. since ALGS is a multiorgan disease and changes in nutrition may impact 
the patient’s condition (e.g., growth);  
Lack of the changes in bilirubin and liver function parameters in response to maralixibat treatment 
question efficacy of MRX in treatment of cholestasis, the indication initially claimed, and the applicant 
agreed in the course of the assessment to amend the indication to the treatment of cholestatic pruritus 
in patients with Alagille syndrome.  
In the infant population data are very limited, although inclusion of 8 infants with ALGS in study 801 
exceeds the minimum number of 6 stipulated in the PIP. Currently, post-baseline sBA values at week 
13 are available for 6 of these patients and measurements at earlier treatment time points have even 
lower number of patients. Accuracy and sensitivity of the CSS scale is uncertain given the very young 
age of the infant population. Extrapolation of efficacy from older age population is intrinsically 
burdened with uncertainty. Pruritus severity will be monitored over time by means of the ongoing 
MRX-801 study and the planned long term safety and clinical outcomes study that is made specific 
obligation to this Marketing authorisation.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data in the applied paediatric target population is limited to 88 children with Alagille-Watson-
Syndrome (ALGS) in one pivotal trial (LUM001-304) and 4 small other trials (LUM001-301, -302, -303, 
-305).  
In accordance with the known safety profile of the pharmacological class of ASBT inhibitors, GI events 
including diarrhoea (57.6%) and abdominal pain (45.5%) were the most frequently reported adverse 
drug reactions for maralixibat in the pivotal study LUM001-304 as well as in the pooled ALGS safety 
population. The majority of these events were described to be mild to moderate in severity, transient 
in nature, and resolved with no action taken with maralixibat and no special approaches for monitoring 
were required. Safety data from the 13-week, placebo-controlled studies (LUM001-301 and LUM001-
302) revealed a similar incidence of events of diarrhoea in the overall maralixibat and placebo groups 
(43.6% vs. 44.4% of participants, respectively), while events of abdominal pain were slightly rarer 
reported in placebo subjects (M: 25.6% versus P: 16.7%), respectively. 
The most frequent TEAEs in the ALGS population are reported as abdominal pain (45,5%), cough 
(34.5), diarrhoea (39.4%), headache (20.7%), nasopharyngitis (34.5%), pyrexia (48.3), upper 
respiratory tract infections (20.7%) and vomiting (37.9%). (e.g. from LUM001-304). Median time to 
first onset for events of diarrhoea and abdominal pain was 30 days and 61 days, respectively. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 116/123 
 
 
 
duration of the gastrointestinal events is described as short with a median duration for events of 
diarrhoea and abdominal pain of 2 days and 1 day, respectively. 
The incidence of SAEs in the ALGS open-label, long-term extension studies is reported slightly lower 
with about 29.8% (25/84 participants) for participants exposed to maralixibat. The available limited 
placebo comparison from LUM001-301/302) seems not to indicate a significant difference regarding 
SAEs between maralixibat and placebo. No child died during the trials. 
Laboratory data showed several mostly isolated and seemingly asymptomatic, but significant 
elevations in ALT in some ALGS subjects during treatment and a related warning statement was 
included in 4.4 of the SmPC. Assessing the totality of data it is concluded that these are too limited to 
draw firm conclusions regarding potential hepatotoxicity of maralixibat. Hepatotoxicity has been 
defined as significant potential risk in the RMP and will be monitored post-approval by means of the 
planned long term safety and clinical outcomes study that is made specific obligation to this Marketing 
authorisation.  
Preliminary data in 8 infants (MRX-801) showed that 7 participants (87.5%) had at least 1 treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE), 2 participants (25.0%) had a TEAE related to study drug, and 4 
participants (50.0%) had a Grade ≥3 TEAE. There were 4 participants (50.0%) who had serious 
adverse events (SAEs), none of which were considered to be related to the study drug. No TEAE led to 
study drug discontinuation or death. Four patients had increased levels of transaminases.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety population is too small to identify reliably signals for infrequent or rare toxicities and safety 
assessment is hampered by the fact that the observed safety event may reflect the underlying disease 
as well as drug-related TEAEs. Accordingly, the applicant will provide annual updates on any new 
emerging safety and efficacy data in annual updates to be provided in the annual reassessments of this 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the safety database will be 
enlarged by means of the planned post authorisation long term safety and clinical outcomesstudy. Both 
requirements are defined specific obligations to this marketing authorisation. 
Laboratory data showed several elevations in ALT in some ALGS subjects during treatment. Although 
the underlying liver disease might have contributed to this finding, the DSM was sufficiently concerned 
and triggered an assessment of these events by an independent panel of liver experts. The experts 
concluded that based on the literature, the accumulated pre-clinical and clinical trial data as well as the 
detailed independent external liver safety review, there is evidence that maralixibat may cause ALT 
elevations in a certain percentage (2-5% probably, 10-20% probably or possibly related events) of 
subjects with ALGS. No predictors of this treatment response have been identified so far. None of the 
observed events were assessed as serious and none led to liver-related morbidity or mortality. Since 
data in the paediatric population is very limited more data will we generated post-approval in a 5 year 
prospective, long term safety and clinical outcomes study on the long-term safety and clinical 
outcomes of Livmarli as outlined in the specific obligations of this marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the applicant will provide yearly updates on all newly 
emerging data on safety and efficacy to be assessed within the annual reassessments for an unlimited 
time. 
Due to the underlying disease, it is difficult to identify potential drug-related gastrointestinal adverse 
events. 
Maralixibat was designed to be minimally absorbed following oral administration because the site of 
action is within the lumen of the GI tract. It is metabolically stable in vivo and excreted almost

Page 117/123 
 
 
 
exclusively in the faeces as intact parent drug. However, it needs to be considered from the non-
clinical data that in the human paediatric population bioavailability may increase. A more permeable 
intestinal barrier may result from situations in which the gastrointestinal system is chronically 
disturbed and could lead to higher blood levels of maralixibat and induce other systemic adverse 
events particularly in children below the age of one year. Even though higher systemic exposure has 
been tolerated in previous human (adults) and non-clinical studies without critical safety findings it is 
planned that the patients, especially those under the age of 1 year, are closely monitored for safety in 
the post-authorisation phase (MRX-801 study, LEAP study, SOB to this marketing authorisation).

*The assessments of the strength of evidence consider also a number of sensitivity analyses 
accounting for confounders provided post-hoc and not displayed in the table. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Reductions observed in sBA and esp. in sBA-related pruritus (based on ItchRO(Obs, Pt) and CSS) in 
the main study (DB phase) are considered highly clinically relevant favourable effects, as intractable 
pruritus is generally a burdensome and difficult to manage clinical symptom, that is also a key reason 
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 119/123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for surgical intervention (biliary diversion or liver transplantation) in patients with ALGS. Improvement 
in the pruritus was accompanied with improvements in the quality of life, sleep and fatigue (mostly 
over the open-label long-term treatment period), which are also considered important favourable 
effects. Multiple sensitivity analyses indicate that these effects seem to be maintained in the 
“responder” patients over at least 2 years period of time.  
In addition to sBA reductions, beneficial effects were also observed on cholesterol (obligatory precursor 
of sBA) and in xanthoma (small effects). However, these were not accompanied with clinically relevant 
improvements in bilirubin and liver function parameters (key indicators of liver damage due to toxic 
effects of bile acids).  
Maralixibat appears to have an acceptable safety profile in patients with ALGS. Gastrointestinal adverse 
events as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting are reported to be the most common adverse drug 
reactions. Almost all of the TEAEs observed were mild to moderate and resolved with no action taken 
with maralixibat, which is suggestive of an overall favourable safety/tolerability profile. 
However, a significant degree of uncertainty remains at present. In particular, this concerns the risk 
for potential intrinsic hepatotoxicity of maralixibat, which seems possible from the data available. 
Better characterisation of this potential risk will be done post approval by means of the planned long-
term safety and clinical outcomes study and the annual updates on safety and efficacy within annual 
reassessments. Both requirements were made specific obligation to this marketing authorisation.  
The ALGS trial population is a paediatric orphan disease population and thus very small. Therefore, the 
degree of remaining uncertainties is naturally high.  
Data submitted in the infants to substantiate broadening of the indication are very limited. However, 
extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from older children appears justified, given that similar effects 
on sBA and on CSS as in the older population were observed, and since no new and unique AEs were 
reported in the infant population. Nonetheless, the degree of uncertainty remains high and post-
approval monitoring of safety and efficacy will be conducted.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Currently, efficacy of maralixibat in the claimed indication for treatment of cholestatic pruritus in ALGS 
is based on a placebo-controlled short-term withdrawal trial and long-term open-label data on pruritus 
and sBA (key PD marker of efficacy and acknowledged driver of pruritus in ALGS) in patients of 1 year 
of age and older and on short-term and uncontrolled open-label data on sBA and pruritus in a very 
limited set of infants 2-10 months of age. The data provided on efficacy are limited but sufficient 
considering the rarity of the disease and the continuous provision of new emerging data on an annual 
basis in this marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstance. 
The safety profile in patients >2 months of age, even though based on limited data, is considered 
acceptable for marketing authorisation. The important potential risk of hepatotoxicity of maralixibat is 
considered balanced with a warning statement on liver monitoring in 4.4 of the SmPC. Both 
uncertainties will be followed up upon post approval within this marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances. 
The benefits gained from maralixibat treatment in relation to cholestatic pruritus and its sequelae 
together with the acceptable safety profile are considered to be sufficient to support an indication for 
“treatment of cholestatic pruritus in ALGS patients of 2 months of age or older”.  
Assessment report  
EMA/864249/2022 
Page 120/123 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The comprehensiveness of the data package 
The comprehensiveness assessment in the finally agreed indication is provided below referring to 
“treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS of age of 2 months and older”:  
1.  Quality of evidence. The key evidence of efficacy is limited to a small, single, mostly uncontrolled, 
open-label trial in a 1 to 17 years old patient population with only a 4-week randomised placebo-
controlled withdrawal phase. To allow for a more robust assessment of efficacy and safety the 
duration of the placebo-controlled phase should have been longer as suggested in a previous EMA 
scientific advice. It is however acknowledged by the CHMP that there should be a restricted use of 
placebo in this rare disease and consistency is seen across various parameters interlinked (e.g., 
sBA levels, ItchRO, CSS, fatigue scores), which suggest sufficient robustness of the effects 
observed. Evidence of efficacy in infants is limited to a small, single-arm, open-label trial, with 
efficacy parameters restricted to sBA and CSS assessments over the time period of around 13 
weeks. 
2.  The precision of effect size: Treatment effect was demonstrated in a small sample size and its 
precision is therefore naturally low. The absence of a placebo-control for most of the observation 
period further adds uncertainties to the true effect size. However, the effects on sBA and pruritus 
are sufficiently large to conclude on a relevant benefit.  
3.  The endpoints are considered to be clinically meaningful, as these capture various aspects of the 
burden of cholestatic pruritus on the affected patients.  
4.  The maintenance of effect has been shown for up to week 48, which can be considered sufficient to 
establish long-term efficacy. However, absence of placebo control specifically for the subjective 
and variable symptom of pruritus is acknowledged as limitation.  
5.  Safety exposure. With a safety database of 86 treated patients, the number of patients is limited. 
It is not considered possible to draw robust conclusions on safety in relation to potential 
hepatotoxicity and post-marketing data will be necessary.  
6.  The safety follow up duration is considered acceptable in the patients above the age of 1 year, but 
not in younger population. Post-approval collection of safety information especially in younger 
patients is, therefore, planned. 
7.  The proposed target population can be substantiated with the data from the studies. Extrapolation 
of data to older patients with >50 kg of body weight is accepted. 
8.  Mechanism of action of the product is clearly described. However, it remains unclear whether the 
proposed dosing regimen is optimal.  
9.  The natural history of the disease is relatively well described.  
In conclusion, the CHMP does not consider the data provided to be sufficiently comprehensive to 
support a full MA. Therefore, at Day 181 of the procedure, the applicant applied for a MA under 
exceptional circumstances.  
The CHMP agrees with the applicant that, due to the very low prevalence of the disease, it cannot 
reasonably be expected that comprehensive efficacy and safety data can be generated within a 
reasonable timeframe. Availability of patients for placebo controlled trials due to widespread use of 
ileal bile acid transport inhibitors in ongoing and completed clinical studies and expanded access 
programmes can be expected to become even more difficult once the medicinal product is placed on 
the EU market. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it

is not possible to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of 
use. 
Within a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances the applicant will annually provide 
post-authorisation long term safety data and data on long-term clinical outcome events in patients 
with Alagille Syndrome to address the above-mentioned general uncertainties by means of a long term 
safety and clinical outcomes trial which is a specific obligation of the marketing authorisation. In 
particular the trial will also further evaluate hepatotoxicity and monitor pruritus severity and sBA over 
time. Furthermore, the applicant will provide yearly updates on all new emerging information 
concerning safety and efficacy of maralixibat within the annual reassessments. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
At Day 181 of the procedure, the applicant applied for a MA under exceptional circumstances.  
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied for 
indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances is considered appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Livmarli is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Livmarli is favourable in the following indication): 
Livmarli is indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 
2 months of age and older 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances 
This being an approval under exceptional circumstances and pursuant to Article 14(8) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that maralixibat is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan PIP P/0133/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

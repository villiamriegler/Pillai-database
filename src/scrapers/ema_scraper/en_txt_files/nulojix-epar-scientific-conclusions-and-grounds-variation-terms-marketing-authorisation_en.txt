Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for belatacept, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Infusion related events are any signs or symptoms experienced by patients during the infusion of 
pharmacologic agents or any event occurring on the first day of drug administration. Symptoms are 
timely related to the drug administration and may range from symptomatic discomfort to 
serious or fatal events caused by anaphylaxis. One case of anaphylactic reaction (including 
symptoms of generalized rash, dyspnea, dizziness, arterial hypotension and atrial fibrillation with 
tachycardia) has been reported post-marketing for belatacept. The present product information for 
belatacept contained information that there have been no reports of anaphylaxis and hence the product 
information has been amended to reflect that anaphylaxis has been reported during post-marketing 
surveillance. 
The risk management plan (RMP) has been updated accordingly to include information on the event of 
anaphylaxis. Infusion-related events, including anaphylactic reactions, are included as a potential risk in 
the RMP.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC Rapporteur considered that 
changes to the product information of medicinal products containing belatacept were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for belatacept the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing belatacept is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for edoxaban, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
Cases of headache, abdominal pain, and dizziness have been reported and, whilst the detail of the 
cases as provided by the MAH is somewhat limited, for all 3 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) there is 
plausible temporal association and a proportion of positive de-challenge such that an association is 
possible. Confounding factors are not strongly supported by the data as presented and therefore do 
not influence the reflection of the above reported ADRs in the SmPC. On the basis of the data 
presented, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness are added to the list of adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) of the SmPC and the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for edoxaban the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing edoxaban is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

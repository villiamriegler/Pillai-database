2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited disease characterized by acute or 
sub-acute painless vision loss in one eye, generally followed by a similar vision loss in the second eye in 
a matter of weeks or few months (typically 2-4 months). Initially, in the acute phase, LHON patients 
experience a rapid and severe loss of visual acuity (VA) and colour vision associated with dense central or 
centrocecal scotoma. Fundus changes have been reported to occur in the pre-symptomatic phase, while 
in other cases, the fundus looks entirely normal. In the chronic phase of the disease, the optic discs 
become atrophic, starting usually within six weeks of disease onset. Most patients (~97 %) progress to a 
bilateral VA of 20/200 or worse within 1 year of disease onset. This fixed bilateral symmetric visual deficit 
remains for most patients life-long within the legal definition of blindness.  
The prevalence of LHON is not very well established but estimated at 1/15,000 to 1/50,000 worldwide. 
LHON typically affects young adult male patients with a mean age of onset of 18-35 years, but women, 
small children and patients over 60 years of age can also be affected. Risk factors suggested in the 
scientific literature to promote the development of LHON include alcohol and tobacco consumption, 
although the association with the disease appears somewhat controversial.  
Most LHON patients have visual loss as the only manifestation of the disease, but rare cases also present 
with cardiac (Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine, and long QT syndromes) and neurological 
manifestations (Leber plus; Bower et al. 1992).  
LHON is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), whereby three point mtDNA mutations 
account for more than 90% of all LHON cases in the European Union (EU): m.11778G>A (ND4 subunit), 
m.14484T>C (ND6 subunit), and m.3460G>A (ND1 subunit). The m.11778G>A mutation generally is the 
most common point mutation in individuals, although there is considerable variation in the relative 
frequency worldwide. All of the three main primary LHON mutations result in amino acid changes in 
complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In LHON patients, 
this change leads to a defect in complex I and disrupts the electron transport chain. However, the 
mutations are not always associated with a measurable respiratory chain abnormality. Experimental 
evidence connects complex I dysfunction to elevated levels of oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial 
membrane potential and, as a consequence, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.  
While in most cases, LHON leads to permanent vision loss, a minority of patients show spontaneous 
recovery of visual acuity by a mechanism that is not yet understood. Visual recovery, when it occurs, 
generally happens slowly between 6 and 12 months after the onset of the initial vision loss; however, 
sudden dramatic improvement in vision have also been reported to occur even many years after symptom 
onset. Publications in the scientific literature (Sadun et al. 2011 & Gueven et al., 2013) suggest that 
mitochondrial impairment initially, in the acute stage of the disease, results in retinal ganglion cells 
(RGCs) becoming inactive but remaining viable. This state can last for prolonged periods of time, so that 
functional recovery may be possible. With time, reduced efficiency of ATP synthesis and increased 
oxidative stress are believed to sensitize RGCs to apoptosis and the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) 
gradually degenerates, leading to permanent vision loss.

Page 9/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Subjects with the m.14484T>C mutation have a 37–71% chance of some degree of visual improvement, 
while those with the m.11778G>A mutation only have a small chance around 4%. Subjects with the 
m.3460G>A mutation are reported to have a chance of recovery somewhere between those with the 
m.14484T>C and m.11778G>A mutations but the number of individuals bearing this mutation is too 
small to derive robust figures (Fraser et al., 2010). Positive prognostic features for visual recovery include 
a favourable mutation status and an age of disease onset less than 20 years. It has also been suggested 
that thicker RNFL and larger optic disc vertical diameter may be associated with a better visual prognosis 
(Fraser et al., 2010).  
About the product 
The active substance in Raxone is idebenone, which is a short-chain benzoquinone derivative and a 
synthetic analogue of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10). Idebenone exerts antioxidant properties and by 
inhibiting lipid peroxidation may be able to protect cell membranes and mitochondria from oxidative 
damage. The proposed mechanism of action in LHON is that idebenone mitigates inactive-but-viable 
retinal ganglion cell dysfunction by shuttling electrons onto complex III of the mitochondrial transport 
chain, thereby bypassing the deficient complex I, restoring production of cellular energy and decreasing 
oxidative stress in affected cells. 
The proposed indication for Raxone was treatment of patients 14 years of age and older with Leber’s 
Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Raxone is available as 150 mg film-coated tablets. The proposed dosing 
regimen is 900 mg/day administered as 2 tables three times a day. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Application for a marketing authorisation of Raxone is an Application using Mnesis 45 mg tablets as 
reference medicinal product. Mnesis 45 mg tablets have been authorised in Italy since 1993 for treatment 
of cognitive and behavioural deficits due to cerebral pathologies of vascular or degenerative origin. Mnesis 
contains the same active substance as Raxone and is also administered via the oral route. The Applicant 
claimed that bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioavailability studies and no studies 
against the reference product were provided. This was justified by the Applicant by the differences in the 
strength, daily dose and target population. The Application for Raxone only referred in certain areas to 
Mnesis, in particular to non-clinical data, and in all these areas there was no need for bioequivalence or 
comparable bioavailability studies to the reference product (see relevant sub-sections of sections 2.3. and 
2.4. where reference to Mnesis is made). For these reasons, the CHMP agreed that no studies against the 
reference product were necessary.  
The Application was supported by quality, non-clinical and clinical data including the results of one 
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase II trial, RHODOS, investigating the efficacy, safety 
and tolerability of idebenone in the treatment of patients with LHON’s disease. Additional efficacy and 
safety data in the target population were provided from an expanded access program (EAP) and a natural 
history case record survey (CRS). The latter data had not been available in a previous Application made 
in 2011 which was withdrawn in 2013. Supportive safety data were furthermore available from the clinical 
development program in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) as well as from post-marketing reports.

2.2.    Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 150 mg of 
idebenone as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, povidone 
K25, magnesium stearate, colloidal silica, macrogol 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide and 
sunset yellow FCF (E110), as described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a polypropylene (PP) twist-off 
cap, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance idebenone is 
2-(10-hydroxydecyl)-5,6-dimethoxy-3-methyl-2,5- cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione (IUPAC), corresponding to 
the molecular formula C19H30O5 and has a relative molecular mass 338.44 g/mol. It has the following 
structure: 
The structure of the active substance has been confirmed by IR, MS, NMR (13C and 1H), X-ray 
crystallography, and UV, all of which support the chemical structure. 
It appears as a yellow-orange crystalline, non-hygroscopic powder. It is insoluble in water and freely 
soluble in ethanol. No dissociation constant has been calculated because idebenone has neither basic nor 
acidic function. Its logPoct/wat was found to be 3.93 at 25°C. 
Idebenone is achiral. Two structurally distinct crystal forms are known and the most thermodynamically 
stable form has constantly been produced with the current process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Idebenone is manufactured by a simple two-step chemical synthesis from starting materials sourced from 
a different supplier. Idebenone is supplied by two different manufacturers both of which use the same 
manufacturing process. There is no isolated intermediate in the process. The reagents and solvents are 
common in chemical synthesis. Conventional chemical reactions are used. The final purification is 
performed by re-crystallisation in two different solvent mixtures. Reprocessing of the crystallisation step 
is foreseen and is acceptable. The synthesis has been described in sufficient detail and critical process 
parameters (CPPs) have been reported and are considered satisfactory. The in-process controls applied in 
the synthesis are adequate. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 11/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
However since there is no isolated intermediate in the proposed two-step process, the CHMP considered 
that, as part of a more complete control strategy, the active substance starting materials should be 
considered at previous steps of the synthetic process. The applicant has committed and initiated work so 
that the starting materials will be redefined. The originally proposed starting material will be defined as an 
intermediate in the revised process. The route of synthesis of this intermediate remains the same and the 
additional steps will be carried out under GMP. The revised process will be implemented once the relevant 
GMP activities, such as validation of test methods, setting specifications, process validation are completed 
by November 2015.  As an additional measure until the new process is fully implemented, the CHMP 
further required a new more stringent specification for the originally proposed starting material -isolated 
intermediated in the updated synthetic process- which is now put in place. In this regard batch data from 
eight recent batches of the originally proposed starting material have been presented and all met the 
revised specification. An updated comprehensive impurity discussion, including genotoxic impurities, has 
also been provided. The specifications and control methods for current starting material and reagents 
have been presented.  
The CHMP considered that the information presented, the steps taken and the commitments provided by 
the applicant are sufficient to ensure that the quality of the product is warranted and give no rise concerns 
that could impact the safety of the medicinal product. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene bags, sealed with plastic ties, and 
placed into a drum. The polyethylene bags comply with the relevant EC regulations and Ph. Eur. 
requirements. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for: appearance and colour (visual 
inspection), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, melting range-), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residual catalysts (ICP-AES), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), particle size form (laser diffraction) and microbiological 
quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data on six full scale batches from one manufacturer and three full scale batches from the 
second manufacturer were provided. Analytical data of batches manufactured by both manufacturers 
indicate that a product of the same quality is produced at both manufacturing sites. The submitted batch 
analysis data also confirm that the manufacture is sufficiently robust and provide reassurance that the 
process yields active substance of consistent quality, complying with the specification.  
Stability 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of active substance from the first manufacturer and three 
commercial scale batches from the second one stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 
months under long term conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH and for up to six months under accelerated 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 12/89 
 
 
  
 
 
conditions at 40 °C/75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The parameters tested were 
appearance, water content, related substances and assay. The same analytical procedures as for the 
release analysis were used, which had been shown to be stability indicating. The long term and 
accelerated data provided showed no sign of degradation or other change for any of the parameters 
studied.  
The stability of the active substance was also investigated under stress conditions in solid state and 
solution. Stability under heat, light (as per the requirements of the ICH guideline Q1B), acidic, alkaline, 
neutral and oxidative conditions was studied. Results showed significant degradation under high pH only.  
However the two formed degradation products were observed in the long term or accelerated conditions 
stability studies and, therefore, were not included in the active substance specification. 
Based  on  presented  stability  data,  the  proposed  5  years  re-test  period  without  any  special  storage 
conditions for idebenone are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Raxone is a film-coated tablet containing 150 mg of idebenone. Idebenone has been marketed as Mnesis 
sugar-coated tablets containing 45 mg of active substance for the treatment of cognitive disorders. 
The development of Raxone film-coated tablets was focused on developing a similar formulation as 
Mnesis. The proposed dosage form has been developed taking into account that patients suffering from 
different mitochondrial diseases such as LHON, need a higher dose of idebenone. 
The selected excipients are common tablet ingredients and their level has been justified. The individual 
excipients used in the coating as well as the colorant are of European Pharmacopoeia quality. The colorant 
also complies with Regulation (EU) 231/2012. The excipients have been varied on a quantitative basis to 
optimize the characteristics and performance of tablets. The particle size and compression force have 
been optimised throughout the development of the product. 
Coating of the tablet was required to improve the appearance of the film-coated tablet. However, sugar 
coating was excluded for patients’ acceptability and clinical reasons related to the underlying conditions of 
those patients. Therefore, a film-coated tablet containing 150 mg of idebenone has been developed as the 
appropriate dosage form for the disease and the target population. The selection of the coating has been 
adequately justified.  
No incompatibilities with the excipients have been foreseen. This has been confirmed by stability data. 
Tablets of the same qualitative composition have been used throughout development.  
The polymorphic stability of idebenone in film-coated tablets 150mg was investigated by Differential 
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). The investigation has demonstrated 
that the polymorph contained in the tablets remains unchanged, when tablets are stored for up to 5 years 
at 25°C/60% RH including   up to for 4 months storage at 40°C/75% RH. Based on these studies, it was 
concluded that the manufacturing process of idebenone, as well as, storage and transport of the 
film-coated tablets 150 mg should exclude temperature excursions above 45°C in order to avoid 
polymorphic transformations. 
The development of the dissolution method proposed for routine QC testing has been presented and the 
choice of the selected conditions and medium has been sufficiently justified. The method has been shown 
to be discriminatory with regard to relevant changes in manufacturing process parameters. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)

The manufacturing process has been optimised during scale up and process parameters ranges/ values 
have been set. The packaging material of Raxone film coated tablets is HDPE bottles with a polypropylene 
twist-off cap which complies with the relevant EU regulations. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 9 steps as follows: mixing, granulation, drying, screening, 
blending I, blending II, compression, coating and packaging. It is a standard process and has been fully 
described. Critical steps have been identified and adequate in-process controls for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form have been put in place.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies at both ends of the 
proposed batch size range. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specification include tests and limits for: appearance (visual), 
identification of idebenone (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.-UV) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur). The tests and acceptance criteria 
were set according to ICH guideline Q6A.  
As no degradation products have occurred in batches during stability studies there are no specified 
degradation products in the specification. The impurities controlled in the active substance specification 
are process by-products and not degradation products. Considering also that, of the two identified 
polymorphs, one of them is obtained only under extreme conditions, which do not occur during the 
proposed manufacturing process, it is considered justified the specification not to include a test for 
polymorphic form.  
Batch analysis data for three commercial scale batches were presented and all batches meet the 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches stored under long term conditions for 60 months at 
25 ºC / 60% RH and for up six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches of are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, assay and degradation products and microbiological 
quality. The analytical procedures used were the same as for release and were shown to be stability 
indicating.  
From the provided long-term and accelerated data there is no sign of degradation at any of the conditions 
studied. The level of unspecified impurities each remains below LOQ in most cases. All other tested 
parameters were within the specification limits and showed no trends. 
A photostability study was performed according to ICH Q1B on one commercial scale batch. The provided 
results showed that the product is not light sensitive.  
In-use stability testing to demonstrate that the product remains stable after the first opening of the 
multidose container was also performed. The testing period was 30 days, which represents the 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 14/89 
 
 
  
 
 
anticipated period of use of the multidose container. The product did not show any significant change to 
any of the parameters tested (appearance, dissolution rate, assay, impurity profile, microbiological 
contamination). The in-use stability results confirm that Raxone 150 mg film-coated tablets are stable 
under these conditions.  
Based on the presented data, the 5 year shelf life without any special storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable.  
Adventitious agents  
None of the excipients apart for lactose are of animal origin. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced 
from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human 
consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf 
rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, biological and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The current synthetic process is described in detail and the agreed control strategy 
is considered acceptable. However with a view to a more complete control strategy the applicant has 
committed to redefine the active substance starting material and thus update the manufacturing process 
to bringing additional synthetic steps under GMP by November 2015. The development, manufacture and 
controls of the finished product have been sufficiently documented and justified. The results of tests of 
active substance and finished product carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
To implement the revised and agreed synthetic process for the manufacture of the active substance from 
the agreed starting materials by November 2015.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
As the Application for Raxone is a hybrid Application, the non-clinical development programme partially 
relied on data of the reference product Mnesis. In addition, the Applicant presented primary 
pharmacology data in an animal model of LHON, safety pharmacology studies as well as some other 
non-clinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies performed with idebenone in order to support the 
use of Raxone in LHON. These non-clinical studies were reported to be compliant with Good Laboratory 
Practice. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
LHON disease is caused by genetic mutations in mtDNA that impair both mitochondrial function and the 
generation of cellular energy and expose energy-demanding tissues to oxidative stress. These 
cell-damaging events culminate in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and apoptotic cell death as well 
as atrophy of the optic nerve causing blindness of affected patients. 
Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) and is proposed to function as an 
electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, to inhibit lipid peroxidation and protect cell 
membranes and mitochondria from oxidative damage. The hypothesis presented in several published 
studies is that idebenone interacts with the electron transport chain and modulates mitochondrial electron 
flux. During this interaction, idebenone is reduced by complex I to 2H-idebenone which can return 
electrons to complex III, thereby providing a redox by-pass of complex I and stimulating alternative 
pathways to maintain cellular energy production.  
Idebenone, in its reduced form, has been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species formation and lipid 
peroxidation and to protect retinal cells from damage that arise through complex I inhibition. Published 
data from isolated mitochondria from different tissues suggest that idebenone, but not its metabolites 
QS10, QS6 or QS4, has an effect on cellular electron transfer which can help restoring mitochondrial 
respiration (Sugiyama et al., 1985; Degli Esposti et al., 1996; James et al., 2005; Haefeli et al., 2011).  
In relation to the LHON indication, the Applicant has carried out one in vitro and several in vivo studies.  
The results from the in vitro study using retinal cell line RGC-5 showed that idebenone increases RGC 
viability after treatment with rotenone, a potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. Statistically significant 
effects were observed after incubation with idebenone from concentrations ≥10nM. The observed effect 
was dependent on the duration of idebenone incubation prior to rotenone treatment with a greater extent 
of cell protection after pre-incubation for 2 days compared to 1 day. 
The prevention of retinal neurotoxicity and the recovery of vision loss have furthermore been studied by 
the Applicant in vivo in a rodent LHON model. The LHON mouse model used for the in vivo studies are 
described in the literature (Ellouge et al. 2008, Abdeljalil et al. 2005). To simulate the situation of a 
mutated mitochondrial complex I, intravitreal injection of rotenone was used. Data from two studies 
indicate a slight protection by idebenone of retinal tissue, i.e. reduction of RGC loss, preservation of 
retinal thickness and protection from cell stress response, which was observed at doses of 400 mg/kg/day 
and 2000 mg/kg/day administered via the feed. This is in line with the scientific literature (Heitz et al, 
2012). A second study showed that idebenone enhanced the recovery of vision in the same LHON mouse

model. When applying generally accepted conversions for the calculation of the human equivalent dose 
(species mouse conversion factor 12.3), the effect dose concentrations of idebenone used in the LHON 
mouse model were comparable to the clinical dose envisaged to be applied in man (900mg/day 
corresponding to 15mg/kg/day in a 60kg man). The estimates suggest that the concentration that could 
be reached in the human eye is comparable to the concentrations that showed efficacy in vivo. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted and reference is made to the reference 
product for this hybrid Application, Mnesis. The CHMP considered that this approach was acceptable (see 
also section 2.1. type of Application and aspects on development) and that no further secondary 
pharmacodynamic data was needed. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
For safety pharmacology, the Application largely relies on the reference product Mnesis. 
In addition, the Applicant performed both an in vitro and an in vivo study to investigate the potential 
cardiovascular and QT effects of idebenone. The hERG assay indicated inhibition of rapid delayed rectifier 
potassium current (IKr) only at nominal concentrations of idebenone far in excess of plasma levels 
achieved clinically. The in vivo study with telemetered Beagle dogs focussed on the effect of idebenone on 
the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Idebenone at 20, 100 and 500 mg/kg was without effect on 
blood pressure, heart rate, QT interval as well as other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, respiratory 
rate, and tidal and minute volume, both with respect to pre-dosing baseline values and to vehicle-treated 
controls. Idebenone was therefore considered to be without any influence on the cardiovascular and 
respiratory systems in the dog at single doses up to 500 mg/kg. Toxicokinetic data showed that the 
animals were adequately exposed to idebenone in the studies.  
In conclusion, no effects on the QTc interval or other cardiologic effects were detected in these studies. 
These results were supported by the clinical findings that showed no effect on ECG morphology or the QTc 
interval in human volunteers or LHON patients receiving idebenone (see section 2.6. ).  Administration of 
idebenone was also without effect on the locomotor behaviour of the animals.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
With regards to the nonclinical testing for possible pharmacodynamic drug interactions of idebenone and 
its major metabolite Q10, reference is made to Mnesis. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP (see 
also section 2.1. type of Application and aspects on development).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In addition to a summary of the available data in the scientific literature, the Applicant provided results 
from two PK studies in mice to investigate absorption and distribution characteristics of idebenone. With 
regards to metabolism, excretion and PK drug interactions, reference is made to Mnesis and published 
literature.  
PK  studies  have  been  performed  in  the  same  strain  of  mice  used  for  the  primary  pharmacodynamic 
studies  (see  section  2.3.2.  ).  The  aim  of  these  studies  was  to  measure  levels  of  idebenone  and  its 
unconjugated metabolites in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye as well as in plasma, following 
treatment with idebenone. Idebenone was either administered as a single oral (gavage) dose or in the 
diet (20-2000 mg/kg/day) over a period of three weeks. Idebenone after oral dosing in mice was quickly 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 17/89 
 
 
  
 
 
absorbed. It was identified in the plasma and in the eye vitreous and aqueous humors within 15 min of 
administration.  Idebenone  was  extensively  metabolised  and  all  of  the  metabolites  measured  in  the 
plasma  or  eye  fluids  were  present  at  higher  levels  than  idebenone  with  the  following  order 
QS4>QS6>QS10>idebenone. The metabolite levels measured in the aqueous humor were approximately 
5-fold higher than those reported in the vitreous humor. Terminal half-lives (t½) of the product after 
single oral (gavage) administration of idebenone and its major metabolites QS10, QS6 and QS4 were 
1.70, 2.31, 6.22 and 5.84 hours, respectively. Overall the data indicate that idebenone enters the eye and 
is detectable in the aqueous and vitreous humor in concentrations which reflect its plasma profile. 
In a detailed distribution study of idebenone’s PK characteristics carried out by Torii et al. (1985) in rats 
and dogs, idebenone was found in relatively high concentrations within minutes after dosing in the liver 
and kidneys, plasma and later in the intestine and highly perfused organs. Reports showed that a 
considerable amount of unchanged idebenone was distributed in the mitochondrial fraction (34.4%). Due 
to a high first pass metabolism occurring in liver and intestinal mucosa < 1% of idebenone reaches 
systemic circulation. The metabolism of idebenone includes oxidation and shortening of the side chain 
resulting in the metabolites QS-10, QS-8, QS-6 and QS-4. These metabolites including the parent 
compound are further modified by conjugation (glucuronidation or sulfatation) resulting in conjugated 
forms of the metabolites as well as the parent compound. The main excretion route of idebenone and/or 
its metabolites is via urine in rats and dogs, which accounted for approximately 50-70 % of excretion. 
Studies performed in pregnant rats showed idebenone in both fetal plasma and tissues from pregnant 
rats, suggesting that the compound crossed the placenta. There were findings of idebenone at relatively 
low concentration in rat milk. No accumulation was reported after repeated dosing in rats and idebenone 
was excreted into milk in moderate amounts. 
Idebenone, QS10, QS6 and QS4 were found to be largely protein-bound in rat, dog and human plasma. 
This information was used to support studies using human biomaterials performed to address the 
interaction potential of idebenone and QS10 on a range of Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (see section 
2.4.2. ). This approach was deemed appropriate. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A summary of published studies has been provided to characterise the non-clinical toxicological profile of 
idebenone. In addition, one 39 weeks chronic toxicity study in dogs, one 4-week repeated toxicity study 
in rats and two genotoxicity studies performed by the Applicant were submitted. The Applicant 
furthermore referred to the reference product Mnesis, in particular to address the carcinogenic properties 
of idebenone. 
Single dose toxicity  
In single dose toxicity studies in mice and rats (Chiba et al., 1985), idebenone was found to be of low 
acute toxicity, presenting an LD50 value of more than >10000 mg/kg following oral and subcutaneous 
administration and 700-800 mg/kg after intraperitoneal administration. The direct cause of death seemed 
to be a respiratory failure by either route of administration. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Idebenone was tested in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats up to 26 weeks and Beagle dogs up to 
39 weeks (Masuoka et al., 1985; Spicer and Wazeter, 1985; Suhara et al., 1985a, 1985b). In studies of 
≥ 5 weeks rats and dogs were exposed to idebenone oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. In another short 
animal study, rats were dosed up to 2500 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Chromaturia due to coloured 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 18/89 
 
 
  
 
 
metabolites, mainly the di-demethyl derivatives of QS4 and QS6 which were conjugated with glucuronic 
acid and sulphuric acid, was observed in both species. Coloured faeces were also seen in dogs 
occasionally. 
In the 4-week rat toxicity study sponsored by the Applicant, Wistar rats were given oral (gavage) 
idebenone at dose levels of 20, 100 and 500 mg/kg body weight/day. The main effect of idebenone 
observed was local changes in the forestomach mucosa of the animals. Yellow colouration and mucosal 
thickening of the forestomach, occasionally accompanied by forestomach dilatation and the appearance 
of red spots in the fore- and glandular stomach was observed at necropsy. The histopathological findings 
comprised of dose-dependent increase in incidence/severity of submucosal inflammatory infiltrates, 
erosions and ulcerations of the forestomach, and hyperkeratosis, and epithelial and basal cell hyperplasia, 
focal necrosis and oedema.  
In the 39-week chronic toxicity study in dogs (plus 8 week recovery), idebenone was administered at 500, 
750 or 1000 mg/kg once daily by oral gavage. Vomiting of mucus, yellow or orange fluid and/or feed was 
recorded in all animals at all dose levels with the incidence showing a relationship to dose. Other signs, 
observed on occasion in isolated animals at 750 and 1000 mg/kg/day included salivation, abnormal 
consistency and discoloration of faeces, dark urine, shivering, whimpering and recumbency. There were 
no ophthalmological changes or changes in haematology, clinical biochemistry or urinalysis that were 
considered to be related to treatment with idebenone. 
A decrease in mean heart rate was recorded in all idebenone treated groups in Weeks 26 and 39, 
especially in the male dogs, when compared to the controls. The decrease was occasionally apparent 
before dosing as well as after dosing. This effect was not dose dependent and was possibly secondary to 
an overall lower activity due to clinical signs combined with chronic low food consumption and loss of body 
weight, although there was no change in heart rate in the high dose animals at the end of the 8 week 
recovery period. Sinus arrhythmia and/or sinus pause, reflecting the decrease in heart rate, were seen in 
single animals after dosing at 750 or 1000 mg/kg/day (one animal at each dose level) in Weeks 13 and 
26. There were no other effects on the amplitudes or intervals or changes in the wave-form of the 
electrocardiogram, including QTc, which were considered to be related to treatment with idebenone. 
Safety studies aiming at providing a greater understanding of the mechanistic effects of idebenone on 
vital functions, with special focus on the cardiovascular system, are reported in section 2.3.2.   
A slight hypertrophy has been observed in the liver of two animals dosed at 1000 mg/kg/day but they 
were without any further indicator for liver injury.   
The incidence and severity of the clinical signs, low food consumption and body weight losses were 
greatest in animals dosed at 1000 mg/kg/day and all changes reported were reversible. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity of idebenone was studied in an in vitro Ames test study and an in vivo mouse micronucleus 
test. Idebenone showed no genotoxic potential with respect to gene mutations in bacteria. Clastogenic 
potential was observed at high concentrations of idebenone, in the chromosome aberration test. This 
potential could be linked to the cytotoxic effect at high concentrations in vitro, which are most likely 
related to the redox properties of the substance. Furthermore, no genotoxic effects were observed in the 
in vivo mouse micronucleus test (tested at doses of 1250, 2500 and 5000 mg/kg once or 5000 mg/kg 
daily for four successive days).  
Reference was also made to the reference product Mnesis, whereby SmPC Section 5.3 of Mnesis states 
that idebenone does not have any genotoxic potential. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 19/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed by the Applicant. The Applicant referred to the reference 
medical product Mnesis. The SmPC of the reference product states that no carcinogenicity concerns are 
expected from the administration of idebenone. This approach was considered acceptable by the CHMP 
(see also section 2.1. type of Application and aspects on development).  
Reproduction toxicity 
Reference was made to Mnesis as well as published data in the scientific literature including a fertility and 
early embryonic development study, two embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits and a pre 
and postnatal study in rats. 
Fertility and early embryonic development in male and female rat studies at up to 500 mg/kg/day showed 
a higher rate of post-implantation losses and a lower number of live embryos. However, there were no 
other adverse effects at either dose on reproductive performance or on embryogenesis. 
There was no effect on the development of the foetuses or growth of F1 animals observed in the 
teratology study, where a NOAEL of 500 mg/kg/day was identified. The main effect reported in this study 
was chromaturia. Similar results were obtained in a teratology study in rabbits where the only effect was 
again chromaturia at the highest dose administered (150mg/kg/day). 
In pre- and postnatal studies in rats chromaturia was observed at 100-500 mg/kg/day and 
hypersalivation in the 500 mg/kg/day group. The effects reported where similar to those identified in the 
repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data at steady state were generated in the 4-week toxicity study in rats and and in the 
39-week dog toxicity study. At cmax at the respective NOAEL (500 mg/kg/day in rats and 750 mg/kg/day 
in dogs), concentrations of idebenone in plasma were 21 – 22 times higher in the rat and 25 – 28 times 
higher in the dog, when compared with the maximum mean concentration observed in man receiving 
2250 mg Raxone, a dose 2.5 times higher than the envisaged dose of 900 mg/day Raxone in patients. The 
safety margin for the exposure, as measured by the AUC at steady-state for the NOAEL, ranged from 
16 – 22 in the rat and 20 - 22 in dogs. 
Local tolerance 
Reference was made to Mnesis, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP (see also section 2.1. type 
of Application and aspects on development). 
Other toxicity studies 
Impurities 
The sum of all impurities (identified and unidentified), with the exception of the mayor Impurity A, were 
below the qualification threshold of 1.0%. The specification limit for the Impurity A was set to 0.5%. 
Impurity A has been qualified with respect to genotoxicity and repeated dose toxicity in rats and dogs up 
to 0.68% (see non-clinical repeat toxicity results). Since Impurity A is a close analogue of idebenone, the 
suggested limit of <0.5% was considered acceptable and the impurity level could be considered qualified. 
Photosafety 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 20/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Idebenone does not absorb light within the range of natural sunlight at the wavelength of 290 - 700 nm. 
Therefore, in line with the ICH guideline S10 on Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/752211/2012) there was no need for photosafety testing with idebenone. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
Based on epidemiological data on the prevalence of LHON in Europe taking into account published data 
from a meta-analysis for all three primary mtDNA mutations (Mascialino, 2011), the market penetration 
factor (Fpen) was calculated at 0.0000223. The Predicted Environmental Concentration 
(PECsurfacewater) for idebenone was consequently estimated at 0.01 μg/L. PECsurfacewater. The 
analysis was further refined based on data obtained during an information request to European registries, 
eye hospitals, and other database holders, resulting in a refined Fpen of 0.00000537 and a 
(PECsurfacewater of 0.0024 μg/L. The two values were right at or below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L as 
defined in the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*, 2006). The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) of 
idebenone was determined at pH 8.2 to be 3.93 (log Kow). Since log Kow of idebenone was below the 
trigger of 4.5 screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was not required. 
Based on the available data, no adverse environmental effects were anticipated with the use of Raxone 
in LHON’s disease and the CHMP considered that a Phase II (Tier A) environmental fate and effect 
analysis was not required.

Conclusion 
Potential PBT (N) 
Conclusion 
< 0.01 threshold 
From a non-clinical perspective, this Application was supported by primary pharmacology data in an 
animal model of LHON, safety pharmacology studies as well as some other non-clinical pharmacokinetic 
and toxicology studies. In addition, the Applicantion relied in certain aspects on the approved information 
of the reference product Mnesis and data published in the scientific literature. 
The antioxidative effect of idebenone is widely studied and presented in the literature. The 
pharmacodynamic effect in the proposed indication is proposed to be mediated through a redox by-pass 
of complex I of the respiratory chain resulting in ATP generation despite the complex I dysfunction in 
LHON’s disease. While data from in vitro and in vivo models at clinically relevant concentrations and 
dosages suggest that use of idebenone could be beneficial in LHON’s disease, the mechanism of action of 
idebenone remains to be fully elucidated. The approach of the Applicant to only test idebenone in one in 
one animal species, was considered acceptable because the mitochondrial respiratory chain is conserved 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 21/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
across species. However, the LHON mouse model used in the primary pharmacodynamic studies did not 
fully replicate the disease in humans. Therefore, the CHMP considered that efficacy will need to be 
demonstrated in the clinical setting as the non-clinical data, though supportive, were not entirely 
conclusive.  
With regards to safety pharmacology, based on the results of a hERG assay and a study with telemetered 
Beagle dogs, idebenone was considered to be without any influence on the cardiovascular and respiratory 
systems.  
Non-clinical PK data showed that after oral administration, idebenone was rapidly absorbed. A high first 
pass metabolism occurring in liver and intestinal mucosa was reported in the scientific literature and 
excretion took place via the urine and bial. 
As no specific human metabolite has been identified, mice, rats and dogs were considered to be the 
relevant animal models for the toxicity assessment. The Applicant’s choice of species was therefore 
supported. In summary, the target organ in the rat was the forestomach, a finding reflecting low clinical 
relevance. In the dog study, clinical signs of gastrointestinal disturbances and emesis were the only signs 
of toxicity and considered likely due to non-specific, localized physiochemical irritation resulting from the 
very high doses of idebenone. Coloured urine and faeces were observed due to coloured metabolites.  
Although adequate toxicokinetic data in dogs are lacking, some PK data indicate that a sufficient safety 
margin exists with regards to administration of a daily dose of 900 mg Raxone in humans. In addition, 
adequate exposure margins were obtained in rats and dogs. Non-clinical data generally revealed no 
safety concern for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, 
and genotoxicity. In addition, according to the scientific literature and data for Mnesis, idebenone seems 
to have no carcinogenic potential, nor did it show any effect on the reproductive development, and there 
was no evidence of embryotoxic or teratogenic potential.  
The lack of formal local tolerance studies as well as studies in juvenile animals was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP as the local toxicity findings observed were limited to the forestomach in rats (species 
specific tissue), no systemic toxicity and no target organ effects have been reported in dogs and no 
differential pharmacokinetics between adults and the proposed paediatric population (>14 years old) are 
expected. Furthermore, idebenone is not expected to induce dependence and hence, no studies to this 
end were required.   
Finally, Phase I ERA was considered sufficient in light of the expected low environmental exposure when 
used in the intended orphan indication. No adverse environmental effects are to be expected with the use 
of idebenone. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the CHMP considered the non-clinical data presented to be adequate to support the Application 
for a marketing authorisation of Raxone in the treatment of LHON. Additional studies in suitable animal 
models and at relevant concentrations have been conducted and were considered supportive to establish 
the pharmacodynamic effects with regards to the proposed indication as well as the safety, PK and 
toxicological profile of idebenone. Cross-references to Mnesis as well as published data in the scientific 
literature were considered adequate by the CHMP and sufficient to justify absence of some of the 
non-clinical tests (see also section 2.1. type of Application and aspects on development).

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
In support of this Application, results of a Phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study 
(SNT-II-003, RHODOS) in 85 LHON patients as well as from the single visit RHODOS Observational 
Follow-Up Study (SNT-II-003-OFU; RHODOS-OFU) were provided. Additional data were presented from 
an Expanded Access Programme (EAP; SNT-EAP-001) and a Natural History Case Record Survey (CRS; 
SNT-IR-006). Finally, data were submitted from 4 Phase I studies in healthy volunteers (SNT-I-001, 
SNT-I-002, SNT-I-003, and SNT-I-004) that investigated the pharmacokinetics of single and repeat 
dosing with Raxone. Reference was also made to literature reports of LHON patients treated with 
idebenone. 
The Applicant also provided reports from clinical trials with idebenone in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) 
patients, including one Phase II study (NICOSIA, 48 patients) and two Phase III efficacy, safety and 
tolerability studies (MICONOS, 232 patients and IONIA, 70 patients), which primarily served as 
supportive safety information (see section 2.6. ). 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

PK  data  on  idebenone  were  available  from  4  Phase  I  clinical  trials;  studies  SNT-I-001,  SNT-I-002, 
SNT-I-003 and SNT-I-004. Two studies (SNT-I-002, SNT-I-004) were single-dose studies performed to 
characterise the PK of Raxone over a seven-fold dose range (150 mg to 1050 mg idebenone). A third 
study (SNT-I-003) investigated the PK profile following a single oral dose and after repeated three times 
daily (t.i.d.) oral dosing for 2 weeks. In SNT-I-003, the urinary excretion of idebenone as well as the 
plasma  PK  and  its  metabolites  were  assessed.  This  study  was  performed  at  two  different  dose  levels 
(150 mg t.i.d. and 750 mg t.i.d.). In the fourth study (SNT-I-001), the effect of a high-fat meal on the PK 
of idebenone given as a single tablet of 150 mg and as five tablets of 150 mg was investigated. 
All methods used for the analyses of idebenone and its metabolites in plasma as well as urine have been 
adequately validated and could therefore be considered reliable with regards to accuracy and precision of 
quantification of the analytes using LC-MS/MS. As the available analytical techniques did not allow to 
measure conjugated idebenone and its metabolites, samples were subjected to enzymatic acid hydrolysis 
prior  to  quantification,  so  that  the  determined  analyte  concentration  represent  the  sum  of  the 
unconjugated and conjugated molecules. PK parameters were calculated by using non-compartmental 
methods. Standard statistical methods were applied.  
Limited plasma samples were also collected in the pivotal Phase II trial RHODOS in patients with LHON 
and in two studies conducted in patients with FRDA.  
Furthermore, a Population PK (PPK) model has been developed for idebenone and its metabolite QS10 
from  Raxone-treated  subjects  in  the  four  Phase  I  safety  and  PK  studies  (total  70  healthy  subjects), 
RHODOS in LHON patients (55 patients) and two Phase III efficacy, safety and tolerability studies in FRDA 
patients (MICONOS, 173 patients and IONIA, 46 patients). A non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach 
was use with one- or two- compartmental models as a starting point for each PK model. A full covariate 
model  approach  was  implemented,  where  all  covariate-parameter  relationships  of  interest  and 
significance following a univariate analysis were entered in the model, and parameters were estimated. 
The full model was further reduced to identify the final model based on various goodness-of-fit criteria. 
The idebenone plasma concentration-time data was adequately described by a one-compartment model 
with first-order absorption and elimination. 
The Applicant also performed two in vitro studies to assess the effects of idebenone and QS10, on the 
inhibition  of  Cytochrome  P450  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4 
isoenzymes as well as the potential for induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (with the measurement 
of mRNA) in human primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, the ability of idebenone to act as a substrate or 
inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was assessed. 
Absorption  
Single  dose  studies  showed  that,  when  only  one  dose  of  idebenone  was  administered,  plasma 
concentrations of idebenone were mostly below the limit of quantification. Between-subject variability of 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 24/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
plasma idebenone concentrations was relatively high (coefficient of variance of AUC0-t and Cmax was 44 to 
124%).  
After administration of repeat doses in fasting conditions, time to reach maximum plasma concentration 
(t max) of unconjugated and total idebenone was reached rapidly, with a median (range) of approximately 
0.67 (0.33-2.00)  hours  and  1.33  (0.67-2.67)  hours  respectively.  The  corresponding  figures  after 
administration of a high-fat meal were 1.17 (0.67-3.50) and 1.33 (1.00-3.00) hours. The data provided 
thus indicate that food modifies the bioavailability of idebenone with a 5-fold increase in the maximum 
plasma concentration (cmax) and a 7-fold increase in the area under the curev (AUC0-∞) when idebenone 
was given in fed conditions.  
No bioequivalence studies have been performed since the final formulations were used in most of the 
clinical pharmacology studies as well as in the pivotal efficacy and safety study. Absolute bioavailability of 
idebenone has not been studied given that it has not been administered intravenously.  
Distribution 
No data on distribution in humans have been submitted. A summary of data from the scientific literature 
for in vitro and animal studies have been provided (see section 2.3.3. ). In addition, the Applicant referred 
to the reference product Mnesis, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP (see also section 2.1. type 
of Application and aspects on development). As per the product information of Mnesis, idebenone passes 
the blood-brain barrier and is distributed at significant concentrations in cerebral tissue.  
Elimination 
Following  oral  administration,  idebenone  is  rapidly  metabolised  via  oxidative  shortening  to  yield 
metabolites QS10, QS6 and QS4. Idebenone and these metabolites concomitantly undergo conjugation 
via  glucuronidation  and  sulphatation  to  yield  conjugated  moieties.  These  are  represented  by  IDE-C 
(IDE-C), QS10-C, QS6-C and QS4-C. 
Figure 1 – Metabolism of idebenone 
* conjugation 
Accordingly, systemic exposure to idebenone was generally low compared to its metabolites suggesting 
extensive first-pass elimination. Plasma concentrations of idebenone were measured, in general, between 
approximately  0.33  and  2.67h  post-dose  and  0.33  to  6h  post-dose  after  single  and  repeated 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 25/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
administration  of  150  and  750  mg  Raxone,  respectively.  There  was  no  excessive  accumulation  of 
idebenone in plasma, consistent with a short half-life relative to the dosing interval. 
In the single and repeat dose study, QS4+QS4-C was the most prominent drug-derived material in urine, 
representing,  on  average,  49.3  to  68.3  %  of  the  total  amount  of  drug  administered.  QS6+QS6-C 
represented 6.45 to 9.76 %, whereas the amount of QS10+QS10-C and idebenone+idebenone-C was 
close to 1% or below. No meaningful determinations of the apparent terminal half-life (t ½) and AUC0-∞ 
were possible from the limited measurable concentrations. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of total idebenone and its related metabolites has been shown to be dose and time 
proportional for doses between 150 mg t.i.d. and 750 mg t.i.d. Following a doubling in dose, systemic 
exposure  (AUC  and  cmax)  increased,  on  average,  approximately  1.7  to  2.5-fold.  For  unconjugated 
idebenone,  the  data  did  not  allow  any  assessment  of  time  dependency  since  AUC0-∞  could  not  be 
determined after a single dose.  
The  consequences  of  possible  genetic  polymorphism  have  not  been  evaluated.  However,  this  missing 
information is also true for the reference product Mnesis. 
Limited PK information was available in the target population. In LHON patients, the highest mean plasma 
exposure following administration of 300 mg idebenone t.i.d. was 3.18 ng/ml. In comparison, in FRDA 
patients receiving doses up to 750 mg t.i.d., the highest measured exposure to idebenone was 42.5 ng/ml 
in study week 52 (MICONOS study) and mean exposures in the high dose group were 4.261 ng/ml. The 
highest mean exposures were measured in the IONIA trial at 750 mg t.i.d. in week 4 (7.547 ng/ml). Thus, 
exposure to idebenone in LHON patients in RHODOS was lower than in the other two FRDA Phase III trials. 
Special populations 
The Applicant provided results from a population PK model, in which age, race, body mass index, body 
weight,  health  status  (healthy  subjects,  LHON  patients  and  FRDA  patients),  food  effect,  creatinine 
clearance,  transaminases,  bilirubin  and  disease  severity  were  incorporated  as  covariates.  Of  these 
covariates, only food (see also results for absorption above) and body weight were considered relevant 
factors.  However,  although  the  inclusion  of  weight  as  a  covariate  effect  on  clearance  (CL/F)  was 
statistically significant, it accounted for only a very small proportion of the high inter-individual variability 
observed. When CL/F was adjusted for body weight there was only a small reduction in variability (55 to 
52 %).  
No data were provided for renal and hepatic impaired subject, but creatinine clearance was investigated 
as a covariant in the PPK model and no statistically significant was found.  
Raxone has not been studied in children under 14 years or in the elderly.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vivo interaction studies have been performed for LHON patients.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In  order  to  investigated  the  potential  inhibitory  effects  of  idebenone  and  QS10  on  human  CYP450 
isoenzymes, metabolism of the model substrates phenacetin (CYP1A2), bupropion (CYP2B6), paclitaxel 
(CYP2C8), 
tolbutamide 
(CYP2C9), 
omeprazole 
(CYP2C19), 
dextromethorphan 
(CYP2D6), 
midazolam/testosterone (CYP3A4), was measured in vitro in human liver microsomes, in the presence of 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 26/89 
 
 
  
 
 
idebenone or QS10 at concentrations ranging from 0.65 – 96 μM. Positive control inhibitors were used to 
assess the responsiveness of the test system. Ki data were used in conjunction with the maximum plasma 
concentrations observed in vivo to calculate the magnitude of a potential interaction. The data indicated 
that inhibition of human CYP450 isoenzymes occurs in the mid-micro molar range of idebenone and QS10 
which was significantly much higher than the positive controls used in the study. Furthermore, binding to 
human  plasma  proteins  was  measured  for  idebenone  and  QS10  and  recorded  as  98.5%  and  98.8% 
respectively.  
The potential of idebenone and QS10 to induce CYP1A/1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 was assessed in fresh 
human hepatocytes from 3 individual donors at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 μM). Induction was 
evaluated using both catalytic activity and mRNA endpoints. The only statistically significant increase in 
activity induced by idenebone was observed at 10μM for CYP2B6, with a maximum increase of 1.3-fold, 
which was 10.0% of the activity observed with the control inducer phenobarbital. 
The Applicant furthermore investigated the ability of idebenone to act as a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. 
At  concentrations  of  0.1  μM,  1  μM,  10  μM  and  100  μM,  no  efflux  of  idebenone  was  observed  in  the 
MDR1-MDCK cell line. However, idebenone inhibited P-gp activity, as measured by the ability to inhibit the 
efflux  of  the  established  P-gp  substrate  loperamide,  with  IC50  values  of  approximately  50  μM.  As 
intestinal exposure in clinical practice will result in 7-fold higher concentrations than the IC50, inhibition of 
P-gp could not be ruled out.   
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with Raxone in humans. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of idebenone have been studied in three studies using a mouse model as 
well as in cell culture experiments using the retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5 as described in section 2.3.2.  
When applying conversions for the calculation of the human equivalent dose, the estimates suggest that 
the concentration that could be reached in the human eye is comparable to the concentrations that 
showed efficacy in vitro. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Information on pharmacokinetics has been acquired from 4 Phase I clinical pharmacology studies, three 
Phase II  and  III  studies  in  LHON  (RHODOS)  and  FRDA  (MICONOS  and  IONIA)  patients  and  from  a 
Population PK model for both idebenone and its metabolite QS10, generated from all studies mentioned 
before. Reference was also made to the reference product Mnesis, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP (see also section 2.1. type of Application and aspects on development). 
After oral administration, idebenone is rapidly absorbed and shows considerable inter-subject variability 
after  single  or  repeated  doses.  Intake  of  food  significantly  increased  the  absorption  rate,  causing  an 
increase in exposure. The pivotal trials were conducted in fed conditions and the intake of idebenone is 
recommended with food, as reflected in the SmPC.  
Idebenone  is  quickly  cleared  from  the  blood  by  first  pass  metabolism.  It  is  metabolised  via  oxidative 
shortening  of  the  side  chain  to  QS10,  QS6,  QS8  and  QS4,  resulting  in  low  plasma  concentrations  of 
unchanged  idebenone  relative  to  its  metabolites.  Both  idebenone  and  its  metabolites  are  conjugated 
before  excretion.  The  metabolites  behave  dose-proportional  like  the  parent  compound  with  linear  PK 
profiles. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 27/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Effects on special populations were examined in a population PK model for idebenone and its metabolite 
QS10.  Besides  the  already  known  food  effect  and  a  small  effect  of  body  weight,  none  of  the  other 
covariantes tested, i.e. age, gender, race, dose, body mass index, health status, creatinine clearance, 
transaminases, bilirubin and disease severity, were found to considerably affect PK parameters. As the 
effect of body weight only seemed to represent a small percentage of the large inter-individual variability 
observed, the CHMP agreed that no dose adjustment based on weight was needed. 
No  data  were  provided  for  renal  and  hepatic  impaired  subjects,  and  therefore  the  CHMP  agreed  that 
healthcare  professionals  should  be  advised  to  exercise  caution  when  prescribing  Raxone  in  this 
population. 
To address the missing data for children < 14 years, the Applicant proposed restricting the indication to 
use in patients of 14 years of age and older. However, the CHMP considered that LHON may also occur 
earlier during  childhood (see also discussions on clinical efficacy in section 2.5.5. ). Nevertheless, safety 
data  in  children  under  14 years  of  age  should  be  considered  as  missing  information  in  the  risk 
management plan (RMP). Safety and effectiveness data will be collected in this population in the planned 
Product Exposure Registry. Some safety data were also available in FRDA patients as young as 8 years of 
age, at weight adjusted doses of up to 2250 mg/day.  
With regards to older patients, the CHMP noted that the age of onset of LHON’s disease is usually low 
(18 to 30 years of age) and there are only very few LHON patients above 60 years of age. However, 
although rare, LHON may occur in the elderly and therefore, Raxone may also be administered to older 
patients.  Considering  that  factors  such  as  age,  body  mass  index  or  renal  function  did  not  appear  to 
significantly affect PK parameters, the CHMP agreed that no specific dose adjustment was warranted in 
the elderly population, despite the lack of data for this population.  
Data  from  in  vitro  studies  showed  that  idebenone  and  its  metabolite  QS10  did  not  exert  systemic 
inhibition nor induction of CYP450 isoenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, while 
idebenone was not a substrate of P-gp in in vitro assays, it did inhibit P-gp activity at concentrations that 
might be reached in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. However, no interaction studies in 
humans have been performed with idebenone. Therefore, and since the available in vitro data did not 
allow prediction of pre-systemic interactions from intestinal CYP450 interaction, a concern remained that 
idebenone may have an effect on CYP3A4 substrates. The Applicant proposed to conduct a Phase I open 
label  study  of  the  potential  PK  interaction  of  idebenone  and  QS10  with  midazolam  in  healthy  male 
volunteers, to which the CHMP agreed. Furthermore, SmPC section 4.5 was updated with information 
from the in vitro studies and a statement to inform healthcare professionals about the lack of data for 
pre-systemic inhibition of CYP3A4 and to recommend not to combine Raxone with CYP3A4 substrates.  
Information on the mode of action was mainly derived from published in vitro and pre-clinical in vivo 
studies using mice LOHN models. No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted with this 
Application. Further confirmation on the effect of idebenone in LHON will thus need to be based on the 
results of the pivotal Phase II trial RHODOS.  
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that all relevant clinical pharmacology data were correctly reflected in 
the product information. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  available  clinical  pharmacology  data  were  suitable  to  support  the 
Application for a marketing authorisation of Raxone in the treatment of LHON. The product information 
adequately reflected relevant pharmacology data, including the recommendation to administer Raxone 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 28/89 
 
 
  
 
 
with food to increase exposure as well as information on the inhibitory effect on P-gp and lack of data for 
pre-systemic inhibition of CYP3A4. 
However, to address the lack of clinical in vivo interaction studies and consequently concerns of possible 
pre-systemic interactions with CYP3A4 substrates, the CHMP considered that the following measure was 
necessary and thus included as a requirement in the RMP:  
Phase I open label study of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction of idebenone (150 mg film-coated 
tablet) with midazolam in healthy male volunteers. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The main support for efficacy of Raxone in the treatment of LHON’s disease was provided by the pivotal 
Phase II study SNT-II-003 (RHODOS). Result from RHODOS were further supported by the single visit 
observational follow-up study SNT-II-003-OFU (RHODOS-OFU) and data gained from an Expanded 
Access Programme (EAP, SNT-EAP-001). The Applicant furthermore gathered data in form of a historical 
case record survey (CRS, SNT–IR–006) and made reference to the published literature (Carelli et al., 
2011; Mashima et al., 2000; etc). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response studies were performed by the Applicant. Reports from published studies in LHON 
patients (Carelli et al., 2011 and Mashima et al., 2000) referred to doses in a range of 180-675mg/day. 
Data from animal studies suggest that 300 mg t.i.d. may give aqueous humour levels in humans in the 
range where idebenone prevented ganglion cell death in the non-clinical models (see also section 2.3. ). 
Furthermore, previous studies in patients with FRDA showed that there was no additional benefit at doses 
of 2250 mg/day over 900 mg/day. 
Taking into account the available data at the time, the Applicant assumed that a dose of 900 mg/day 
would be likely to be both well tolerated and adequate for efficacy testing and hence selected this dose to 
be administered in three equally divided doses t.i.d. for the pivotal phase II trial.  
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study SNT-II-003 (RHODOS): A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of the 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of idebenone in the treatment of patients with Leber’s 
Hereditary Optic Neuropathy  
The RHODOS study was initially intended as an exploratory trial, but due to the difficulties in recruiting 
patients  with  LHON’s  disease  the  study  was  amended  to  be  used  as  a  “pivotal”  confirmative  trial 
supportive of the marketing authorisation of the product.  
The Applicant provided both the original study report as well as a revised report based on a re-analysis 
using a  modified intent-to-treat  (mITT)  population which  excluded  one  patient  (patient 23),  who  was 
allocated to the placebo arm and experienced a marked spontaneous recovery in vision. Consequently, 
patient 23 was considered by the Applicant to be natural history confounder. 
Methods 
RHODOS  was  a  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group  study  in  LHON  patients 
performed in three centres, in Munich (Germany), Newcastle (United Kingdom) and Montreal (Canada). 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)

Patients were randomised to treatment with either idebenone 900 mg/day or placebo for a period of 24 
weeks. A follow-up visit was performed 28 to 35 days after drug discontinuation.  
Patients  attended  the  clinic  for  six  out-patient  visits:  a  Screening  Visit  performed  within  4  weeks  of 
randomisation, the randomisation/Baseline visit (Visit 2), Visit 3 after 4 weeks of treatment, Visit 4 after 
12 weeks of treatment, Visit 5 after 24 weeks of treatment when study medication was discontinued, and 
Visit 6 (28 to 35 days after drug discontinuation). Throughout the 24-week treatment period, patients 
completed a Patient Diary.

In  addition,  each  patient had  the  right  to  withdraw  from  the  trial  at  any  time  for  any  reason  without 
affecting the right to treatment by the investigator. The investigator also had the right to withdraw the 
patient if he judged it in the patient’s best medical interest. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either idebenone or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  
Idebenone (2 x 150 mg tablets) or placebo were to be administered orally t.i.d. with food beginning the 
morning after the day of Visit 2 (Baseline) and continuing for 6 months (up to Week 24/Visit 5). The total 
daily dose of idebenone was 900 mg.

Measurements of VA  
VA,  expressed  as  logMAR  values,  was  assessed  using  ETDRS  (Early  Treatment  Diabetic  Retinopathy 
Study) charts. Using the logMAR scale allows quantification of results over a large range of visual abilities 
from 0.0 (normal vision) up to 1.68 (able to read only one large letter correctly at one meter). 
 “On Chart VA” was distinguished from “Off Chart VA” as follows:  
• 
• 
If the patient is able to read letters on the chart, “On Chart VA” was measured.  
If the patient could not read any letters (being off the logMAR scale), the investigator recorded 
whether the “Off Chart VA” was reduced to counting fingers (CF) from a distance of 30 cm, hand 
motion (HM) or light perception (LP) = semi-quantitative results.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 32/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
For patients with very poor vision, the assignment of a value of logMAR 0.3 for each step in the categorical 
scale was used in the primary efficacy analysis, i.e. for CF a score of logMAR 2.0 was attributed, for HM a 
score of logMAR 2.3 was attributed and for LP a score of logMAR 2.6 was attributed. 
VA in both eyes was assessed at Screening, Baseline/Visit 2 and Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6. When measuring 
acuity in the right eye, the left eye was covered (and vice versa). Only one reading of a given letter was 
allowed. The distance to the chart was 4 meters. If, however, at least 20 letters were not read correctly 
from 4 meters, the patient’s distance to the chart was reduced to 1 meter and the logMAR score obtained 
reading the 1 meter rows. The distance to the chart was 4 meters. If, however, at least 20 letters were not 
read correctly from 4 meters, the patient’s distance to the chart was reduced to 1 meter and the logMAR 
score obtained reading the 1 meter rows. 
A patient’s VA at nadir (the worst VA at any time post-Baseline) was only considered worse than the VA 
at Baseline if the worsening observed post-Baseline was clinically relevant. Any eye that deteriorated 
from  reading  at  least  5  letters  “on-chart”  (equivalent  to  1  full  chart  line)  to  “off-chart”  VA,  or  which 
deteriorated  “on-chart”  by  at  least  10  letters  (equivalent  to  2  chart  lines),  was  considered  to  have 
deteriorated by a clinically relevant degree and therefore to have reached nadir post-Baseline. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  of  84  patients  for  this  study  was  estimated  based  on  the  following  assumptions  for 
patients in the ITT population: VA change of –0.05 ± 0.3 logMAR in the placebo group and –0.25 ± 0.3 
logMAR in the idebenone group. Such a difference is considered relevant from a clinical point of view. 
Under these assumptions  and  with the proportion of patients receiving idebenone and placebo of 2:1 
respectively, 84 patients provide 80% statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in VA 
change between the two groups. The calculation was based on a two-sided unpaired t-test at the 5% 
significance level, i.e., it was performed under the additional assumption that the stratification factors do 
not influence the outcomes. 
Randomisation 
After establishment of eligibility, patients were randomly assigned to a treatment arm in the proportion 
2:1 (idebenone: placebo). Randomisation was stratified by disease history (onset more or onset less than 
one  year  prior  to  randomization)  and  by  mutation  type  (G11778A,  G3460A  and  T14484C),  to  ensure 
balanced  treatment  allocation  within  the  six  resulting  strata.  The  randomisation  procedure  was 
centralised. For each of the six strata a computer-generated randomisation list was created with blocks 
containing idebenone and placebo allocations in the correct proportion but in random order. The block size 
was 6. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  patient  and  any  persons  involved  in  the  conduct  of  the  study  (investigators  and  their  site  staff, 
monitors and sponsor) were blinded to the treatment. Unblinding of a patient’s treatment was possible 
but was only to be done when a medical emergency necessitated identification of the study substance the 
patient had received. Once a treatment had been unblinded, the patient was not to receive any further 
study medication and was to be withdrawn from the study. 
Statistical methods 
For  continuous  variables  the  mean,  standard  deviation  (SD),  standard  error  (SE),  median,  and  range 
were calculated. For discrete variables, the number of values in each category and the percentage in each 
category were calculated.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 33/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Analyses were performed using SAS® version 8.2. For all analyses, p-values were reported as well as 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for point estimates. Statistical significance was declared for p-values 
below 5%. For interaction tests, a two-sided significance level of 10% was used. 
Analysis Populations  
•  Safety Population  
The safety population was used for analysis of all safety variables. It included all randomised patients who 
received at least one dose of the study medication and for whom a safety assessment was available. 
Patients were analysed according to the treatment actually received.  
• 
ITT population  
Analyses  of  all  efficacy  variables  were  performed  on  the  ITT  population.  This  population  included  all 
randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study medication. Patients were analysed as 
randomised regardless of protocol violations.  
•  mITT Population 
The mITT population was the same as the ITT population but for VA and colour contrast analyses excluded 
Patient  23  (randomised  to  placebo)  identified  as  a  natural  history  confounder  due  to  on-going 
spontaneous recovery of vision at the time of randomisation into the study. Patients were analysed as 
randomised regardless of protocol violations.  
• 
PP population  
All  patients  from  the  ITT  population  who  had  no  major  protocol  deviation  were  included  in  the  PP 
population (referred to in the study protocol as ‘according to protocol’). In this context, a major protocol 
deviation was defined as a protocol deviation that was considered to have a major impact on the efficacy 
results. Major protocol deviations were identified prior to the analysis and before breaking the code. The 
final decision as to which deviations were major was made based on clinical judgment. 
Primary and main secondary efficacy analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population and repeated as a secondary analysis 
on the PP population. Missing data were handled using a Mixed-Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) (see 
Section 11.4.2.2). The between-group difference in the primary efficacy variable was analysed using a 
repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline values used as covariate and 
treatment  group,  mutation  type  and  disease  history  as  fixed  factors.  In  addition,  the  visit  and 
visit*treatment interaction were included in this model as fixed factors.  
Three further analyses which did not require data imputation using MMRM were performed for the primary 
efficacy endpoint using three different strategies for handling missing data. In these analyses, missing 
values  were  either  imputed  with  a  mean  of  the  available  post-baseline  visits,  imputed  using  last 
observation  carried  forward  (LOCF),  or  only  used  available  data.  In  addition,  exploratory  sensitivity 
analyses  were  performed  using  the  best  case  scenario  (the  best  available  efficacy  variable  from  any 
post-Baseline visit was used to impute missing data) and worst case scenario (the worst available efficacy 
variable from any post-Baseline visit was used to impute missing data). In these sensitivity analyses, the 
primary  endpoint  was  analysed  using  an  ANCOVA  model  with  baseline  values  used  as  covariate  and 
treatment group, mutation type and disease history as fixed factor. 
If  Baseline  or  demographic  characteristics  with  prognostic  factors  were  very  unbalanced  between 
treatment groups, further models including such variables or subgroups of patients were to be analysed 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 34/89 
 
 
  
 
 
at the discretion of the study statistician. Furthermore, the interactions between these subgroup factors 
with treatment group were to be investigated. 
Other efficacy analysis 
Analysis of the other secondary efficacy variables was performed using the ITT population. 
Sensitivity analyses  
Patients with very poor vision will not have a quantifiable acuity score, that is, they are off the logMAR 
scale. The study protocol followed the ophthalmological convention for off-chart vision. However, using 
another  assignment  rule  to  the  semi-quantitative  results  CF,  HM  and  LP  may  have  an  effect  on  the 
outcome of the study. Therefore, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed on the VA outcomes of 
the  trial,  which  also  served  the  purpose  of  demonstrating  the  robustness  of  the  proposed  primary 
assignment. 
Subgroups 
Separate analysis of specific subgroups according to 
•  mutation type 
• 
• 
history of disease onset (≤ 1 year; > 1 year) 
smoking history [has the patient ever smoked (Yes/No), is the patient a current smoker (Yes/No)] 
were  performed  of  the  primary  and  selected  secondary  endpoints.  Groups  could  be  pooled  if  they 
contained less than 8 patients. 
Additional analyses not planned in the original statistical analysis plan 
Several additional efficacy analyses were performed post hoc including: 
• 
primary and main secondary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints ‘change in logMAR 
visual acuity including both eyes and assuming that eyes within a patient are independent’ and 
‘change in visual acuity between Baseline and Week 24 of the patient’s best eye at Baseline’ for 
the subgroup of the ITT population excluding patients with mild visual impairment (defined as 
logMAR <1.0 in both eyes)  
• 
subgroup analyses based on 
o  age (<30 years and >30 years) 
o  absence or presence of discordant visual acuity at Baseline (defined as patients with at 
least 2 lines difference in visual acuity (logMAR 0.2) between their left and right eye) 
Furthermore, several additional endpoints were included post-hoc with the revised study report, including 
endpoints using nadir as described above.

Results 
Participant flow 
A  total of  85  patients  were  randomised to  study  treatment  (44 in  Munich,  30  in  Newcastle  and  11  in 
Montreal), 55 to idebenone 900 mg/day and 30 to placebo. Three patients (two treated with idebenone 
and one treated with placebo) were prospectively excluded from the ITT population for the analysis of VA 
endpoints due to inaccurate recordings in VA measurements either at Baseline or at Visit 5 (Week 24) and 
thus 53 patients treated with idebenone and 29 patients treated with placebo were included in the ITT 
population for all VA endpoints. In addition, patient 23 (randomised to placebo) identified as a natural 
history confounder due to on-going spontaneous recovery of vision at the time of randomisation into the 
study was excluded in the mITT population. 
A total of 7 patients discontinued the study prematurely, 3 patients (5.5%) treated with idebenone and 4 
patients  (13.3%)  treated  with  placebo.  The  most  commonly  reported  reason  for  premature 
discontinuation was withdrawal of consent (2 patients treated with idebenone and 1 patient treated with 
placebo). One patient in each treatment group was withdrawn due to adverse events. Finally, two patients 
in the placebo group were lost to follow-up and discontinued for other reasons, respectively. 
A total of 15 patients (12 patients [21.8%] in the idebenone group and 3 patients [10.0%] in the placebo 
group) had at least one major protocol deviation. The most commonly occurring major protocol deviations 
were compliance outside 80 to 120% and visual acuity tests not performed according to protocol.

Recruitment 
Patients were randomized in three study sites, 44 in Munich, 30 in Newcastle and 11 in Montreal. The first 
subject was enrolled on 7 April 2007 and the last subject completed the study on 19 February 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
There were several updates of the study protocol (8 general amendments and 1 site specific amendment) 
and changes to the originally planned statistical analyses during the course of the study. The main 
changes are summarised below. 
The primary study objective was originally ‘to determine whether administration of idebenone in patients 
with LHON onset within the last 3 months can mitigate visual loss in the initially least affected eye’ and the 
primary endpoint was ‘the proportion of patients in whom the initially least affected eye does not 
deteriorate to >1.0 logMAR at or before Week 36’. Patients were required to present with the worst eye 
affected >0.5 logMAR and the least affected eye <0.4 logMAR at baseline to ensure a sufficient difference 
in VA existed between the eyes where natural history would suggest a high probability of deterioration in 
the least affected eye within the period of the study. 
These criteria proved to be extremely difficult to meet and no patients with one affected eye and one as 
yet unaffected eye meeting the inclusion criterion had been randomised into the trial 12 months after 
initiation. In Amendment 3 of the protocol, dated 25 July 2007, the primary objective of the trial and the 
primary endpoint were therefore amended in order to improve recruitment. The requirement for onset of 
visual loss within 3 months of Baseline was extended to include established disease of five years or less 
prior to Baseline (stratification for > and ≤ 1 year was introduced) and the exclusion of patients with VA 
in their least affected eye worse than 0.4 logMAR was correspondingly eliminated. Thus, not only are 
acutely sick patients were to be enrolled, but also those who are in the post-acute stage and have had 
affected eyes for up to five years. The primary objective was changed to ‘to determine whether the 
administration of idebenone can improve visual function in LHON’ and the primary endpoint was changed 
to ‘best recovery of logMAR visual acuity between Baseline and Week 24 in either the right or left eye’. At 
this time the previous primary endpoint became secondary as ;in patients entering the trial with an eye 
still less affected than 0.5 logMAR, proportion of patients in whom the visual acuity in the initially least 
affected eye does not deteriorate to 1.0 logMAR or more’. 
It was furthermore recognised in Amendment 3 that the new best recovery of VA primary endpoint would 
not necessarily reflect changes in VA relevant to the patient’s overall ability to see. Therefore, change in 
the patient’s best logMAR VA between Baseline and Week 24 (where the patient’s VA in the better seeing 
eye at Baseline would be compared to the patient’s VA in the better seeing eye at Week 24, even if the 
better seeing eye was not the same one at Week 24 as at Baseline) was selected as a secondary endpoint 
to complement the new primary endpoint. This endpoint later (Amendment 8, 14 January 2010) became 
the key secondary endpoint. 
The sample size was increased to 84 patients  to account for the more heterogeneous population. The 
inclusion criteria were modified to include patients from 14 to 65 years instead of 16 to 65 years due to a 
request from a centre two treat 2 patients below the original age cut-off of 16 years. 
Furthermore, the study duration was shortened from 36 weeks to 24 weeks and the patient 
randomisation ratio changed from 1:1 to 2:1 in favour of idebenone, in an attempt to encourage patients 
to enrol. 
Baseline data 
Table 2 provides an overview of the demographics of the RHODOS study population. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)

Table 2 – Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population#) 
The majority of patients (33 patients [60.0%] in the idebenone group and 18 patients [60.0%] in the 
placebo group) had smoked prior to enrolment and 21 patients (38.2%) in the idebenone group and 13 
(43.3%) in the placebo group were currently smoking. 
Baseline data for the mtDNA mutation and VA as well as time since onset of symptoms are summarised 
in Table 3. Only 8 patients at Baseline had at least one eye with a logMAR ≤0.5 (6 patients [10.9%] in the 
idebenone group and 2 patients [6.7%] in the placebo group. For the ITT population used for visual acuity 
assessments  (n=82),  at  Baseline  mean  (SD)  visual  acuity  pooled  across  both  eyes  was  logMAR  1.75 
(0.58) in the idebenone group and logMAR 1.68 (0.54) in the placebo group.

A total of 56 patients (37 [67.3%] in the idebenone group and 19 [63.3%] in the placebo group reported 
medical histories and continuing medical conditions that were active at the start of the study. The most 
commonly  reported  medical  conditions  were  abnormalities  of  investigations  reported  by  23.5%  of 
patients (18.2% in the idebenone group and 33.3% in the placebo group) and vascular disorders reported 
by 22.4% of patients (20.0% in the idebenone group and 26.7% in the placebo group). At the start of the 
study,  the  most  commonly  reported  medical  condition  by  preferred  term  was  hypertension  in  the 
idebenone group (reported by 20.0% of patients compared with 13.3% in the placebo group). In the 
placebo  group,  the  most  commonly  reported  medical  condition  by  preferred  term  was  increased 
gamma-glutamyl  transferase  (reported  by  20.0%  of  patients  compared  with  7.3%  in  the  idebenone 
group). 
In  both  treatment  groups,  the  most  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  were  anilides,  mostly 
paracetamol, which were used by 17 patients (30.9%) in the idebenone group and 10 patients (33.3%) 
in the placebo group and propionic acid derivatives, mostly ibuprofen, which  were used by 7 patients 
(12.7%) in the idebenone group and 3 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group. 
Numbers analysed 
Four populations were defined for analysis purposes (see methods for a description). 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 39/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The Safety Population included 85 patients, 55 treated with idebenone and 30 treated with placebo. 
The ITT population included 82 patients, 53 treated with idebenone (96.4% of those randomised) and 29 
treated with placebo (96.7% of those randomised). As explained above, 3 patients were prospectively 
excluded from the ITT population for all VA analyses. 
The mITT population was the same as the ITT population used for VA analyses but excluded Patient 23, 
thus including 81 patients, 53 treated with idebenone (96.4% of those randomised) and 28 treated with 
placebo (93.3% of those randomised).  
The PP population was a subset of the ITT/mITT population and included all data from subjects who had 
no major protocol deviations. In addition, one patient was recorded erroneously as a non-completer and 
was excluded from the PP population although he completed the study. Thus, the PP population included 
65 patients, 41 treated with idebenone (74.5% of those randomised) and 24 treated with placebo (80.0% 
of those randomised).  
Outcomes and estimation 
The  main  results  of  RHODOS  are  summarised  in  this  section  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  this 
Application. Relevant post-hoc analyses are reported under ‘ancillary analyses’. 
•  Primary endpoint: Best recovery of logMAR VA in either right or left eye  
Base on analyses in the ITT population, patients in the idebenone group improved by logMAR -0.135 (+6 
letters) from Baseline to Week 24 whilst patients in the placebo group improved by logMAR -0.071 (+3 
letters). The difference between treatments (logMAR -0.064, equivalent to 3 letters) was not statistically 
significant. Results for both the ITT and the mITT populations are summarised in Table 4.

•  Key secondary endpoint: Best VA at Week 24 (best eye at Week 24) compared to best 
VA at Baseline (best eye at Baseline)  
For the main secondary endpoint, change in Best VA, there was a worsening in Best VA between Baseline 
and  Week  24  for  patients receiving  placebo, while  Best  VA  very  slight  improved  in  the  Raxone  group 
(Table 5). The difference was only statistically significant in the mITT population.

•  Selected other secondary endpoints 
Count of eyes/patients for which the visual acuity improves (at least 0.2 logMAR) between Baseline and 
Week 24  
There were a numerically higher proportion of patients/eyes in the idebenone group compared to the 
placebo group with an improvement in VA of at least logMAR 0.2 at Week 24 compared to Baseline. In 
analyses on the primary endpoint, 20 out of 53 patients in the idebenone arm had a VA improvement 
(37.7%) compared to 7 out of 29 patients in the placebo arm (24.1%). The difference of 14% was not 
statistically significant. Similarly, a difference of 9% between treatment arms for the main secondary 
endpoint was not significant. As could be expected, the difference between treatment groups was slightly 
larger when performing the same analyses on the mITT population. An analysis of the proportion of eyes 
showed a similar trend. 
Sensitivity analyses of the proportion of patients showing an improvement in the primary endpoint by 
change of at least logMAR 0.3 or change of at least logMAR 0.1 was performed. No statistically significant 
differences were seen between treatments.  
In LHON patients with an eye ≤0.5 logMAR at Baseline, the proportion of patients in which the VA in the 
initially least affected eye does not deteriorate to 1.0 logMAR or more 
There were very few patients (N=8) with a least affected eye with logMAR ≤0.5 at Baseline. None of the 
6 patients in the idebenone group showed deterioration to logMAR 1.0 or more whereas both patients in 
the placebo group showed such deterioration. The same results were observed when LOCF was used to 
impute missing data or when missing values were considered a deterioration. 
Other secondary non-VA endpoints 
A colour contrast sensitivity test was performed on a subset of patients in one of the study centres. Most 
patients had abnormal colour contrast sensitivity at Baseline in both Protan (i.e., >6%) and Tritan (i.e., 
>8%) domains in both eyes (94.9% for Protan and 92.3% for Tritan). For both eyes combined, there was 
an increase (i.e., worsening) at Week 24 from Baseline in both treatment groups for red-green (Protan) 
colour confusion which was greater in the placebo group (+5.3%) than in the idebenone group (+1.4%). 
The difference at Week 24 was -3.9%, which was not statistically significant. No changes from abnormal 
sensitivity at Baseline to normal (i.e., ≤6%) at Week 24 for any eye for either treatment group was 
observed. For blue-yellow (Tritan) colour confusion, there was a decrease (i.e., improvement) from 
Baseline in the idebenone group (-7.2%) and an increase (i.e., worsening) in the placebo group (+6.4%). 
The difference of -13.6% was statistically significant (p=0.008). Analyses in the mITT population yielded 
generally larger differences between treatment groups and results for both Protan and Tritan sensitivity 
were statistically significant. For two eyes in the idenbenone group and one eye in the placebo group with 
abnormal Tritan sensitivity at Baseline, normal values were achieved at Week 24. 
Change in scotoma area was assessed by Humphrey™ 24:2 visual field analysis. However, the 
interpretation of these visual field data across the entire study population was difficult due to the 
unreliability of the assessments due to false positive/negative errors and fixation losses. 
Changes in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness follows a distinct temporal development, whereby 
an initial hypertrophy (i.e., increase in RNFL thickness shortly after symptom onset) is followed by a 
progressive reduction in RNFL thickness (Barboni et al., 2010). To account for this temporal development, 
RNFL thickness was analysed for patients with ≤6 months, 6-12 months and >12 months of disease 
history. RNFL thickness in patients with ≤6 months disease history decreased in placebo-treated patients 
(n=4) over time, whereas patients treated with idebenone (n=6) were protected from this 
disease-specific loss of RNFL thickness. For patients with 6-12 months disease history and those with >12 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 43/89 
 
 
  
 
 
months disease history there was very little further loss in RNFL thickness independent of treatment 
assignment. The small sample size per category did not allow a formal statistical evaluation. 
With regards to Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), only small changes in the VF-14 score were 
observed over the 24-week study period and at Week 24, there was no significant difference between the 
treatments (estimated mean treatment difference -1.37; 95% CI: -6.25, 3.51; p=0.577). 
At Week 24, 12 patients (22.6%) in the idebenone group and 7 patients (24.1%) in the placebo group 
from the ITT population had an improvement in Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). A total of 43 
patients (81.1%) in the idebenone group and 24 patients (82.8%) in the placebo group were experiencing 
less fatigue or no change in fatigue levels. There was a significant correlation between the change in CGIC 
and the change in best recovery of VA (primary efficacy endpoint, Spearman’s R2 = -0.32, p = 0.005) and 
between the CGIC and the change in the Best VA (main secondary endpoint, Spearman’s R2 = -0.34, p = 
0.002) for the ITT population. There was no correlation between fatigue score and change in logMAR at 
Week 24. 
At Week 24, patients in both treatment groups reported minimally elevated energy levels  assessed 
by VAS score (0.37 mm for idebenone and 2.17 mm for placebo) with no statistically significant difference 
between the treatment groups (- 1.80; 95% CI: -11.37, 7.77; p=0.709).

Endpoints for post-hoc analyses 
The Applicant presented a number of post-hoc responder analyses, which are summarised below. These 
analyses were conducted on the mITT population only except for responders with “off-chart” vision at 
Baseline for who the ITT population was identical to mITT. Re-analyses for some of the responder 
endpoints were however conducted on the ITT population upon request of the CHMP in order to compare 
data between different datasets (see section 2.5.4. ). 
Responder analysis for patients “off chart” at Baseline 
Patients who were “off chart” at Baseline comprise a subgroup of severely affected patients who were 
unable to read any letters on the chart. Amongst this subgroup, 28% of the idebenone treated patients (7 
of 25 patients) were able to read at least one full line (5 letters) on chart at Week 24, whilst none of the 
placebo patients recovered to this level of vision (p=0.0722). Applying the same analysis to all eyes 
instead of patients resulted in a significant difference between idebenone responders and placebo 
responders (p=0.0078). The mITT and ITT populations were identical for this endpoint. 
Proportion of patients with clinically relevant recovery (CRR) from Baseline 
In an attempt to define a clinically relevant definition of responder, a responder analysis was conducted 
based on the definition for CRR used by Carelli et al. (2011), which distinguished between patients with 
“on-chart” and “off-chart” vision at Baseline. Using this definition, a significantly higher proportion of 
patients in the idebenone group (30.2%) than in the placebo group (7.1%) showed CRR from Baseline 
(p=0.0234; Table 7). Recovery was also investigated in subgroups based on disease duration, mtDNA 
mutation, age and smoking status.

Table 7 – Proportion of Patients with CRR from Baseline at Week 24 (mITT population) 
Proportion of patients in whom the observed Recovery from Baseline improved the patient’s Best VA and 
the proportion of eyes with Recovery from Baseline 
In 12 out of 16 idebenone-randomised and in 1 out of 2 placebo-randomised patients presenting with 
CRR, the recovery also improved the patient’s best VA. 
Recovery was seen in 21 eyes (19.8%) for patients in the idebenone group and in 2 eyes (3.6%) for 
patients in the placebo group and this difference was statistically significant in favour of idebenone 
(p=0.0041). Since the total number of patients with a clinically relevant recovery in the idebenone group 
was 16 patients, this means that 5 patients responded with both eyes. 
Effect size in patients presenting with clinically relevant recovery of VA

Proportion of patients with clinically relevant worsening (CRW) from Baseline 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 45/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients with a CRW from Baseline was calculated as the reverse of the recovery i.e., as 
a change from logMAR ≤1.6 to “off-chart”or a change of logMAR 0.2 “on-chart”). There was no 
statistically significant difference between the treatments (p=0.6058): CRW was seen in 2 patients 
(3.8%) in the idebenone group and 2 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group. In the idebenone group one 
worsening occurred in a patient with the G11778A mutation and one in a patient with the T14484C 
mutation, and in the placebo group one worsening occurred in a patient with the G11778A mutation and 
one in a patient with the G3460A mutation. 
Proportion of Patients and Eyes with CRR from the VA nadir 
Table 9 presents a comparison of the proportions of idebenone- and placebo-randomised patients in the 
mITT population who recovered from their VA nadir. A statistically significant difference in favour of 
idebenone was seen for patients presenting with recovery in favour of idebenone (p=0.0321). Statistical 
significance was also reached in patients with a disease duration ≥1 year, but there was no significant 
between-treatment difference for disease duration <1 year. Amongst the 3 mtDNA mutations, a 
significant difference in favour of idebenone was only seen in the subgroup with the G11778A mtDNA 
mutation. When disease duration and mtDNA mutation were investigated together, only the subgroup of 
patients with duration of LHON ≥1 year and carrying the G11778A mutation showed a significant 
difference between treatments in favour of idebenone [9 of 21 patients receiving idebenone 
(42.9%)versus 0 of 12 patients receiving placebo (0%), p=0.0122]. 
CRR from VA nadir was seen in 23 eyes (21.7%) for patients in the idebenone group and in 3 eyes (5.4%) 
for patients in the placebo group. This difference was statistically significant in favour of idebenone 
(p=0.0066).  
Table 9 - Proportion of Patients with CRR from Nadir at Week 24 (mITT population) 
Time to CRR 
A logrank test of the difference in the median time to recovery since disease onset in the mITT population 
between the idebenone-treated (42.4 months) and placebo-treated (median not reached) patients 
demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the groups (p=0.0133) in favour of idebenone. 
Further analysis of the distribution of the recoveries observed as a function of disease duration at 
Baseline, demonstrates that recoveries were not observed in patients with disease duration greater than 
48 months at Baseline. The proportions of recoveries were similar in the ≤12 months, >12-24, >24-36 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 46/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
and >36-48 month baseline disease duration groups. Whilst the number of patients within the >48-60 
month Baseline disease duration group was small, this observation suggests that the proportion of 
recoveries appears to decline with Baseline duration of LHON greater than 48 months. 
It is also of interest to note that in both treatment groups the recoveries occurring in patients with the 
longest Baseline duration of disease occurred in patients carrying the T14484C mtDNA mutation. 
Figure 3 – Cumulative Percentage of patients Presenting with CRR as a Function of Disease 
Duration (mITT Population) 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses and post-hoc analyses are described as relevant in the previous 
section. See section for additional analyses requested by the CHMP for RHODOS, the EAP and/or the CRS. 
In addition, upon request by the CHMP requested, the Applicant performed additional analyses including 
a  univariate  analysis  on  responding  and  non-responding  patients  to  study  characteristics  potentially 
prognostic for a response (age at Baseline, gender, mutation carried, time since onset at Baseline and VA 
differences at Baseline) and to identify potential imbalances in these characteristics that could account for 
the differences in the proportions of patients responding in the Raxone and placebo groups in RHODOS. 
The analyses showed a trend towards a higher age at Baseline in responders versus non-responders. In 
addition, the T14484C mutation was associated with a higher proportion of responding patients, which 
was  expected  due  to  the  more  benign  course  of  the  disease  in  patients  with  this  mutation.  No  other 
prognostic factor has been being identified as influential for the responder rate in this analysis. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 47/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The Applicant was furthermore asked to show data for patients classified as responders with regards to 
improvements on secondary parameters other than VA. In response, reference was made to the CGIC 
outcome, which correlated significantly with the results of the primary and key secondary endpoints (see 
results  section  above).  In  addition,  the  Applicant  provided  analyses  on  the  differences  observed  in 
responders and non-responders on Protan and Tritan colour contrast vision, CGIC, VAS for self-assessed 
energy level and Visual Function VF-14 score. Overall, the results showed numerically better outcomes for 
these secondary non-VA endpoints for responders compared to non-responders.

Results and Analysis  
Analysis 
description 
Primary Analysis  
The ITT population included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of 
the study medication. Three randomised patients were excluded prospectively from 
the ITT population for all VA analyses due to apparent inaccurate recordings in VA 
measurements either at Baseline or at Week 24. 
The mITT population was the same as the ITT population used for VA analyses but 
excluded Patient 23 (randomised to placebo) identified as a natural history 
confounder. 
Results are shown for both ITT and mITT population, where available. For some 
analyses the ITT and mITT population were identical.

2.5.3.  Supportive studies 
2.5.3.1.  RHODOS Observational Follow-Up Study (SNT-II-003-OFU) 
This was an observational single-visit follow-up study with the primary objective of examining the change 
in VA of patients who had previously participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of Idebenone 
(SNT-II-003, RHODOS), and comparing the current VA with that observed at Baseline and after 24 weeks 
of treatment in RHODOS. 
Study participants:  
The only inclusion criterion was previous participation in study SNT-II-003 (RHODOS). There were no 
exclusion criteria. 
A  total  of  60  out  of  the  85  patients  (70.6%)  who  participated  in  RHODOS  were  enrolled  into 
RHODOS-OFU. 41 had previously received idebenone 900 mg/day (74.5% of idebenone-treated patients 
in  SNT-II-003)  and  19  had  previously  received  placebo  (63.3%  of  placebo-treated  patients  in 
SNT-II-003). 
Of the 60 patients, 58 (idebenone: 39 patients; placebo: 19 patients) had been included in the efficacy 
analysis set. Two patients were not included due to inaccurate VA assessments.

Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  Change in best logMAR VA (Best VA) compared to Visit 2/Baseline and Visit 
5/Week 24 or last treatment visit of RHODOS. 
Secondary Endpoints:    
- 
- 
- 
Change in logMAR VA of individual eyes (Change in VA of Both Eyes) compared to Visit 2/Baseline 
and Visit 5/Week 24 or last treatment visit of RHODOS. 
Change in logMAR VA of a patient’s best eye (Change in VA of the Best Eye) compared to the same 
eye at Visit 2/Baseline or Visit 5/Week 24 or last treatment visit of RHODOS.  
Change in HRQoL assessed by VF-14 questionnaire compared to Visit 2/Baseline and Visit 5/Week 
24 or last treatment visit of RHODOS.  
Treatment: 
No treatment with idebenone was foreseen in RHODOS-OFU. However, there were 5 patients from the 
Total  Efficacy  Population  who  reported  use  of  idebenone  between  Week  24  of  RHODOS  and  the 
RHODOS-OFU visit. The dose used was not provided in all cases, although 3 patients report the use of 900 
mg/day. 
The influence of idebenone use on the VA outcome was investigated. The Change in Best VA from Week 
24  to  the  SNT-II-003-OFU  visit  in  the  Total  Efficacy  Population  was  comparable  to  that  seen  in  the 
subgroup, in which Idebenone treated patients were excluded. 
Results: 
The median time of 30 months (range: 20.9 to 42.5 months; 131 weeks) from Week 24 of SNTII-003 to 
SNT-II-003-OFU was used for illustration purposes in graphs. 
The mean (± SD) age of patients recruited was 33.4 (±14.9) years, with a range of 14.0 to 66.0 years. 
Patients in the Idebenone group were slightly older than those in the placebo group (Mean: 34.4 years 
versus 31.5 years). The majority of patients recruited were male (50 patients [86.2 %]) and almost all 
patients (56 patients [96.6 %]) were Caucasian/white. There were 15 patients in the idebenone group 
and 9 patients in the placebo group with discordant visual acuity (difference in visual acuity of more than 
logMAR 0.2 between both eyes). VA in the best and worst eye at Baseline as well as the proportion of 
patients and eyes with “off-label” VA were balanced between treatment groups. The majority of patients 
had the G11778A mtDNA mutation [28 out of 39 patients (71.8%) in the idebenone arm and 13 out of 19 
patients  (68.4)  in  the  placebo  arm].  Fewer  patients  had  the  T14484C  (15.4%  and  10.5%  for  the 
idebenone and the placebo group, respectively) and the G3460A mutation (12.8% and 21.1% for the 
idebenone and the placebo group, respectively). 
A  summary  of  the  mean  Change  in  Best  VA  from  Baseline  of  RHODOS  to  Week  24  and  to  the 
RHODOS-OFU visit, and the change from Week 24 to the SNT-II-003-OFU visit are provided in Table 11. 
Best VA at the RHODOS-OFU visit was slightly worse than at Baseline in patients in the placebo group 
(mean change in logMAR +0.039, corresponding to a worsening of 1 letter) whereas Best VA improved in 
the idebenone group (mean change in logMAR -0.134, corresponding to an improvement of 6 letters). 
Both treatment groups showed almost identical improvements in Best VA between Week 24 of RHODOS 
and  the  RHODOS-OFU  visit  (idebenone:  logMAR  -0.085,  placebo:  logMAR  0.088,  both  equivalent  to 
improvement by 4 letters).  
For the other secondary VA endpoints (change in VA of Both Eyes and in patient’s best eye), broadly 
similar results were obtained.

Table 11 – Change in Best VA in RHODOS and RHODOS-OFU (Total Efficacy Population) 
From the 7 patients (12 eyes) in the idebenone group who showed improvement in vision from “off-chart” 
at Baseline to “on-chart” at Week 24 in RHODOS, long-term follow-up data were available for 5 patients 
(G11778A or G3460A mutation) from the OFU visit. These 5 patients still had “on-chart” vision at OFU 
visit. One patient could read only 3 letters, whilst 4 patients still were able to read at least one full line 
on-chart. Furthermore, 5 additional patients in the idebenone group changed from “off-chart” to 
“on-chart” vision reading one full line between Week 24 and RHODOS-OFU, resulting in a total of 9 
responders. In the RHODOS study at Week 24, no patients/eyes in the placebo group showed 
improvement from “off-chart” to “on-chart” vision. By the OFU visit, 2 placebo patients (out of 8 for whom 
data were available) recovered to “on-chart”.  
VF-14 data were available for 57 patients enrolled in SNT-II-003-OFU. Overall, the changes between 
VF-14 recorded during RHODOS and RHODOS-OFU were small and differences between idebenone and 
placebo groups were not statistically significant. There was a small worsening in the idebenone group 
(-1.7%) compared to a small improvement in the placebo group (2.4%; p=0.205) for the entire period 
between RHODOS Baseline to RHODOS-OFU 
2.5.3.2.  Expanded Access Program (EAP) 
This  EAP  (SNT-EAP-001)  was  established  by  the  Applicant  to  provide  access  to  Raxone  to  individual 
“named” LHON patients at the request and under the personal care of a registered physician according to 
applicable local regulations. In Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Raxone was provided via a Named 
Patient Programme. As a secondary objective, in addition to providing access to Raxone to patients, the 
EAP aimed at collecting any information relevant to the benefit-risk evaluation of Raxone that becomes 
available in the treatment of LHON. There was no control group. The physician’s usual clinical practice for 
the  management  of  LHON  patients  was  followed  which  generally  entailed  clinic  visits  at  3  monthly 
intervals. 
This EAP did not meet the criteria for a clinical trial under the scope of Directive 2001/20/EC and was not 
conducted in compliance with GCP standards applicable to clinical trials.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 52/89 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Study participants:  
The main criteria for inclusion were a diagnosis of LHON with confirmed LHON mtDNA mutation type and 
onset of vision loss in the second eye less than 12 months prior to the date of the Baseline visit. 
Patients  were  included  in  the  EAP  from  Germany,  United  Kingdom,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Poland, 
Sweden, Spain, Turkey, Switzerland and the United States of America. 
At the time of the data cut for the initial report submitted with this Application (31 January 2014), 61 
patients had been enrolled in the EAP safety population and had received at least one dose of Raxone. The 
efficacy  population  was  a  sub-population  of  the  safety  population  who  carried  one  of  the  3  major 
LHON-causative mtDNA mutations for whom post-Baseline VA efficacy data was available (n=48). 
During the course of the assessment, the Applicant provided an updated EAP report (clinical cut off on 
20 March 2015) including 93 patients in the safety population and 69 patients in the efficacy population.  
Treatment:  
All  patients  received  idebenone  150  mg  film-coated  tablets,  usually  at  the  recommended  dose  of 
900 mg/day. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints: Proportion of patients with CRR in VA from nadir (as defined by Carelli et al., 
2011). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• 
• 
The proportion of patients with CRR by mutation  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  CRR  by  gender,  age  at  Baseline,  smoking  status,  duration  of 
disease at Baseline and VA at nadir  
•  Duration of Raxone treatment at CRR  
• 
The treatment effect size in VA in patients with CRR 
In addition to these analyses, the proportion of patients in whom VA did not deteriorate after Raxone 
treatment initiation was assessed as follows: 
• 
• 
In patients who can read at least the equivalent of 1 line on-chart VA at Baseline (i.e. logMAR 
≤1.60), the proportion of patients with no clinically relevant worsening (CRW) in VA at their last 
assessment (either deteriorating from logMAR ≤1.6 to “off chart” VA or by the equivalent of 10 
letters on chart) in either eye.  
The proportion of patients who had not reached the threshold for legal blindness (i.e. VA logMAR 
<1.0) at Baseline who remained below this threshold (i.e. VA remained logMAR <1.0) at their last 
assessment in either eye. 
Results: 
Demographics  of  the  patients  enrolled  in  the  EAP  were  generally  representative  of  the  disease 
characteristics  of  LHON  with  respect  to  age  at  onset  of  symptoms  (Onset),  mtDNA  mutation  carried, 
gender distribution and smoking status and were similar across both populations. The average age at 
Baseline  was  30.9  years  (range 6.9  –  80.1)  and  6  patients  below  the  age  of  14  were  included.  The 
distribution of the three major mtDNA LHON-causative mutations was 59% for the G11778A, 18% for the 
G3460A and 16.4% for the T14484C mtDNA mutations. The mean time since onset at Baseline was 10.6 
months (range 0.9 – 133.7) for all enrolled patients but was shorter in the efficacy population (mean 7.2 
months, range 0.9-21.5). 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 53/89 
 
 
  
 
 
At the time of the initial report, of the 48 patients in the efficacy population, 44 and 23 had received 
Raxone treatment for at least 6 and 12 months, respectively. Overall, 24 out of 48 patients (50%) and 37 
out of 96 eyes (38.5%) had presented with CRR from nadir by the respective last VA assessment. Of the 
24  responders,  a  total  of  13  (54.2%)  had  CRR  in  both  eyes.  Proportions  of  CRR  by  mtDNA  mutation 
carried, were T14484C (88.9%), G3460A (70.0%) and G11778A (31.0%). Similar results were seen in 
the updated report, whereby CRR was observed in 34 out of 69 patients (49.3%) and 55 out of 138 eyes 
(39.9%). 
In the updated report submitted during the course of the assessment (clinical cut off 20 March 2015), of 
the 69 patients in the efficacy population, 63 had received Raxone treatment for at least 6 months and 45 
for 12 months. The maximum treatment period was 36 months (2 patients)  and the mean treatment 
duration was 15.4 (range 2.8 – 36.2) months. Of the patients for whom 6 month (± 3 months, n=62) or 
12 month (± 3 months, n=47) VA assessments were available, CRR had occurred in 19 (30.6%) patients 
and 30/124 (24.2%) of eyes at the 6 month assessment and in 17 (36.2%) patients and 28/94 (29.8%) 
of eyes at the 12 month assessment.  
Age at Baseline, sex and smoking status did not appear to influence CRR. 
The time from start of Raxone treatment to CRR was ≤6 months in 18 out of 24 patients (75%) and 20 out 
of 24 patients (83.3%) presented with CRR within 12 months of Baseline. The mean treatment time from 
Baseline to first CRR event was 6.6 months (range 2.5-19.9), whilst the mean overall treatment time in 
patients with CRR at last observation was 11.6 months. 
With regard to the effect of time since onset at Baseline, of the 26 patients who had time since onset ≤6 
months in their 1st eye at Baseline, 10 (38.5%) presented with CRR. Of the patients with time since onset 
of  >6-12  (n=15)  and  >12-24  (n=7)  months  at  Baseline,  60%  and  71.4%  presented  with  CRR 
respectively.  
To further explore the impact of time to disease onset, on request by the CHMP, the Applicant carried out 
an analysis which showed that early treatment with idebenone ameliorated the degree of VA loss at nadir. 
As  could  be  expected,  the  mean  VA  at  Baseline  for  all  eyes  with  disease  onset  of  ≤6  month  prior  to 
treatment  initiation was  lower  than  that  of  >6 month  eyes  (logMAR  1.25,  n=59  versus  logMAR  1.49, 
n=37, respectively). However, the mean VA at nadir was also lower in ≤6 month eyes compared to >6 
month eyes (logMAR 1.44 versus logMAR 1.51). Furthermore, in absolute terms, the outcome for  >6 
month eyes was not improved over the outcome for ≤6 month eyes (logMAR 1.21 versus logMAR 1.25). 
When considering only the proportions of eyes with CRR, VA at Baseline, Nadir and Outcome were 1.16, 
1.30 and 0.68 versus 1.37, 1.39 and 0.85, respectively for ≤6 month (18 eyes) and >6 month eyes (19 
eyes). 
2.5.3.3.  Natural History Case Record Survey (CRS) 
The primary objective of the CRS (SNT-IR-006) was to gather further clinical data in order to establish the 
natural course of vision loss and recovery in patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of LHON.  
To  this  end,  historically  documented  VA  data  from  existing  medical  records  were  collected  from 
participating European Vision Institute Clinical Research Network (EVICR.net) member centres, as well as 
from LHON-treating centres in the EAP. A total of 11 centres provided CRS data with 10 located in Europe 
and 1 in the United States of America. 
This CRS does not meet the criteria for a clinical trial under the scope of Directive 2001/20/EC and was not 
conducted in compliance with GCP standards applicable to clinical trials.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 54/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participating clinical centres were asked to provide historical 
case record data from all LHON patients (with molecular diagnosis) on file without pre-selection. 
Number of Case Records collected and analysed: 383  
The population for the Primary Endpoint analysis included 106 patient records and 890 VA assessments 
made ≤2 years after onset of symptoms from patients with no recorded idebenone use, who carried one 
of G11778A, G3460A or T14484C mtDNA mutations and for whom the date of onset of symptoms was 
known (Natural History Population). 
For the Secondary Endpoint analyses, 74 patient records were available, including 774 VA assessments 
from patients in the Natural History Population for whom data from at least one post-presentation VA 
assessment made ≥3-24 months post-presentation (Natural History Outcomes Population).  
Within the analysed case records, idebenone use was reported by 188 patients. Application of the same 
criteria as for the definition of the Natural History Outcomes Population, identified 48 patients that were 
analysed alongside the natural history data. 
Treatment: The CRS targeted patients not receiving idebenone treatment. Within the Idebenone-Treated 
Outcomes  Population,  the  average  dose  used  was  520  mg/day  (median  405  mg/day;  range  60-900 
mg/day) and the mean duration of therapy was 1.5 years. 
Primary endpoint: VA as a function of time since onset of symptoms.

Summary of Results:  
Without Idebenone Treatment 
Sixty-one  per  cent  of  eyes  were  already  legally  blind  at  presentation,  of  which  22%  had  already 
deteriorated  to  “off-chart”  VA.  At  nadir  96%  of  eyes  were  legally  blind  and  75%  had  deteriorated  to 
off-chart  VA.  By  the  time  of  the  last  available  VA  data  point  (mean  14.9  months  after  Onset;  range 
3.9–31.1 months), which was used as the outcome VA, 83% of the patients remained blind. 
VA data from the Natural History Population reflected the very rapid loss of VA characteristic of LHON with 
over 50% of eyes deteriorating to logMAR ≥ 1.0 within 1 week of disease onset, increasing to over 70% 
within 3 months. By 12 months over 80% of patients’ eyes were legally blind. In the 142 observations 
available for 12 to 24 months of onset, 78% of eyes remained legally blind.  
Overall, sCRR in VA from nadir was observed in at least one eye of 23 out of 74 patients (31.1%) and in 
36  out  of  148  eyes  (24.4%).  As  36  eyes  from  23  patients  experienced  sCRR,  13  of  these  patients 
improved with both eyes. The proportions of patients with sCRR appeared similar in patients with time 
since onset at presentation of ≤6 months (31.8%, 20/63) and >6-12 months (33.3%, 3/9). Analysis of 
the proportions of patients with sCRR by mtDNA mutation carried showed that higher proportions of sCRR 
were observed in patients carrying the G3460A (50.0%, 6/12) and T14484C (42.9%, 3/7) compared to 
patients carrying the G11778A mutation (25.5%, 14/55). In the 23 patients presenting with sCRR, the 
mean time from disease onset to sCRR was 9.9 months (1.0 – 27.5 months). Analysis of the magnitude

of  the  best  sCRR  observed  for  either  eye  in  patients  with  sCRR  revealed  a  mean  value  of  39  letters, 
ranging from 5 to 90 letters. Additionally, only 20.9% of patients with on-chart vision (n=67) had no CRW 
of VA post-presentation in at least one eye and only 14.9% of the 47 patients who had VA logMAR <1.0 
at presentation had maintained this status at the time of the latest VA outcome.  
With Idebenone Treatment 
The proportions of eyes with VA of logMAR <1.0, 1.0-1.68 or >1.68 were similar at Presentation between 
the idebenone-treated and untreated Outcome populations. CRR of VA from nadir was observed for 24 of 
48 patients (50%) and 38 of 96 eyes (39.6%) had a CRR. In these patients, the mean time from onset to 
CRR was 16.2 months (range from 1.9 – 39.4 months. The mean magnitude of the best CRR (considering 
the  best  recovering  eye  in  each  patient),  was  38  letters  and  ranged  from  8  letters  to  82  letters. 
Furthermore,  14  out  of  39  patients  with  on-chart  vision  at  presentation  (35.9%)  and  29 of  71  eyes 
(40.8%) in the Idebenone-Treated Outcomes Population had no CRW in the VA of at least one eye. Of the 
26 patients who had VA logMAR <1.0 at Presentation, 7 (26.9%) still had VA logMAR <1.0 at Outcome. 
Compared  to  the  untreated  Outcome  population,  fewer  idebenone-treated  eyes  had  off-chart  VA  and 
higher proportions had on-chart VA or were not legally blind at Outcome. 
2.5.3.4.  Summary of relevant published literature 
The Applicant provided an overview of the scientific literature reporting on the use of idebenone in the 
treatment of LHON. Three retrospective open-label cohort studies (Mashima 2000; Carelli 2011; Orssaud 
2012) and 7 case reports (Mashima 1992; Carelli 1998a; Carelli 1998b; Carelli 2001; Barnils 2007; Jancic 
2011; Peyman 2012) were summarised, collectively reporting on VA outcomes of 143 LHON patients 
treated with idebenone. 
The majority (127 patients, 89%) of patients described in these studies were from Europe (Italy, France, 
Spain, Serbia). The duration of idebenone treatment ranged from 6 months up to 5 years, with 131 
patients (92%) treated for at least 12 months. The idebenone doses used in these 10 studies ranged from 
90 mg/day to 900 mg/day with a majority of patients receiving 270-675 mg/day. 
Mashima (2000) and Carelli (2011) reported the proportion of patients with medically-relevant 
improvement of VA for patients with the G11778A mtDNA mutation (vast majority of patients living in 
Europe) and disease onset ≤ 1year before treatment as follows: 
•  Responders with VA recovery ≥ 0.3 (decimal acuity) in patients treated with idebenone was 
26.4% (4 of 11 patients) compared to 10.0% (1 of 10 patients) in the untreated comparator 
group (Mashima 2000). 
•  Responders with VA improvement by 2 lines on a Snellen Chart or from “off-chart” to “on-chart” 
vision in patients treated with idebenone was 46.7% (14 of 30 patients) compared to 23.3% (10 
of 43 patients) in the untreated comparator group (Carelli 2011). 
2.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials 
In  order  to  compare  the  results  from  the  different  data  sources,  a  comparison  of  the  outcomes  for 
Raxone/idebenone-treated patients with placebo/untreated patients was presented for RHODOS, the EAP 
and the CRS. Table 12 provides a summary of the results for the proportions of patients with CRR, the 
proportions  of  patients  without  clinically  relevant  deterioration  in  VA  and/or  the  proportions  without 
deterioration in VA to logMAR ≥1.0 (legal blindness).

Table 12 – Selected Outcomes for RHODOS, the EAP and the CRS 
Across all studies, 66/149 (44.3%) Raxone/idebenone-treated patients presented with CRR compared to 
26/102 (25.5%) of placebo/untreated patients with sCRR using the same stringent definition of CRR.  
To further facilitate comparison of the findings in the EAP and CRS, a graphical comparison of the VA data 
at different time points was provided (Figure 4). 
Figure 4 - Comparison of Analyses by VA Category for Eyes at Presentation, Nadir and 
Outcome for Raxone/idebenone-treated and untreated Patients 
The data show a similar outcome for patients treated with idebenone across data sets (EAP and CRS), and 
in both cases a larger number of patients with logMAR<1.0 and a smaller number of legally blind and 
patients with off-chart vision compared to idebenone-naïve patients.  
Due to the complex heterogeneity of the Natural History Population studied, i.e., a population of different 
distribution of patients at different stages of LHON presentation of symptoms (the nadir is at different 
time  points)  as  well  as  the  limitation  of  the  number  of  VA  observations,  nadir  might  not  have  been 
established in some patients and this could affect the outcomes reported. Nevertheless, the CHMP was of 
the opinion that the outcome of CRS and EAP could potentially provide independent confirming evidence 
of efficacy of Raxone if data would be adequately analysed and presented. To facilitate the bridging across 
data sets, additional analyses and graphical presentations were requested to allow comparison of CRS 
data with the RHODOS placebo outcome and of EAP data with the RHODOS idebenone outcome. In these 
analyses,  VA  improvement  was  to  be  measured  based  on  change  to  baseline/presentation  instead  of

nadir, as a post nadir recovery concept for the purpose to compare recovery outcome data of different 
study data sets (i.e. RHODOS, EAP and CRS), where important characteristics such as time since onset 
showed marked differences, was considered unsuitable.  
In response to the request, the Applicant provided additional analyses of responder outcomes (CRR and  
CRW) both on a “per eye” or on a “per patient” level and by VA status (off-chart or on-chart) and for 
short-term observations (6 months) and long-term data (36 months). The results are shown in Table 13, 
Figure 5 and Figure 6. 
CRR was defined as follows: 
•  All eyes/patients (requests 6, 7, 10a and 17-19): For off-chart (HM or worse) at baseline, any 
improvement  to  the  next  better  off-chart  category  (intra-off  categories)  or  improvement  to 
on-chart is considered a response; for off-chart (CF) at baseline response is defined as being able 
to read at least 5 letters on-chart at week 24; for on-chart at baseline improvement is defined as 
VA improved by ≥ logMAR 0.2 at week 24 (at patient level: CRR in at least one eye). 
•  All patients (request 14, 15 and 16): CRR in at least one eye - Definition as per post-hoc analyses 
in RHODOS. 
•  Off-chart eyes/patients with both eyes off-chart at baseline (requests 1-3 and 11-13: Definition 
as per post-hoc analyses in RHODOS (at patient level: CRR in at least one eye). 
•  On-chart eyes at baseline (requests 4 and 5): Definition as per post-hoc analyses in RHODOS. 
CRW was defined as follows: 
•  All  eyes/patients  (8,  9,  10b  and  20-22):  For  off-chart  at  baseline,  any  worsening  to  the  next 
worse off-chart category is considered a worsening; for on-chart > 1.6 logMAR at baseline any 
worsening  to  at  least  HM  off-chart  is  considered  a  worsening;  for  on-chart  ≤  1.6  logMAR  at 
baseline worsening is defined as VA worsened by ≥ logMAR 0.2, or by worsening to off-chart at 
week 24 (at patient level: CRW in both eyes) 
Graphical  presentations  of  VA  changes  over  time,  taking  into  account  time  to  onset  and  time  to 
baseline/presentation, were also provided.

Tabular presentations in response to analysis requests 6 + 7 (all eyes) and 17 + 18 (all patients) show the 
results  for  CRR  (including  intra-off-chart-improvements)  in  VA  after  24  weeks  compared  to 
baseline/presentation for all idebenone treated patients (RHODOS idebenone treatment arm and the EAP) 
versus placebo/natural history data (RHODOS placebo treatment arm data and CRS). Results for analyses 
6+7 show a higher proportion of eyes with CRR in the idebenone group [RHODOS idebenone: 23.6% 
(25/106) and EAP: 25.0% (24/96)] than in untreated eyes [RHODOS placebo: 13.8% (8/58) and CRS: 
16.6%  (31/187)].  The  estimated  unadjusted  odds  ratio  (OR)  based  on  data-pooling  for  treated  and 
untreated conditions over trials was OR=1.69 (95% CI: [1.06; 2.71]). Corresponding analyses (request 
17 + 18) on the per-patients level shows similar results [RHODOS idebenone: 32.1% (17/53) and EAP: 
35.4% (17/48) versus RHODOS placebo: 20.7% (6/29) and CRS: 23.4% (22/94); OR=1.72, 95% CI: 
(0.96;  3.11)].  Similarly,  CRR  regardless  of  intra-off-chart-improvements  (request  14  and  15)  was 
consistently higher for idebenone treated patients [RHODOS idebenone: 30.2% (16/53) and EAP: 33.3% 
(16/48)]  than  for  untreated  patients  [RHODOS  placebo:  10.3%  (3/29)  and  CRS  19.1%  (18/94); 
OR=2.25, 95% CI: (1.20; 4.23)]. 
Results of request 11 and 12 (CRR in at least one eye in patients, who were off-chart at baseline in both 
eyes) revealed a higher estimated proportion of CRR for untreated off-chart patients included in the CRS 
[RHODOS Placebo: 0.0% (0/13) and CRS 30.0% (3/10)] than for idebenone treated patients [RHODOS 
idebenone: 28.0% (7/25) and EAP 25.0% (2/8)]. However, the sub-set of patients was rather small and 
estimates have low precision. 
For  the  endpoint  ‘no  CRW’  (request  20  +  21;  CRW  in  both  eyes  including  intra  off-chart  categories), 
response rates in the untreated and treated conditions were found to be  heterogenic and in rather high 
ranges (RHODOS idebenone: 94.3% (50/53) and EAP 72.9% (35/48) versus RHODOS placebo: 82.8% 
(24/29) and CRS 61.7% (5/91)]. 
Data  from  untreated  patients  after  36  months  showed a  higher  proportion  of  patients/eyes  with CRR 
compared 
to 
treated  patients  after  6  months.  Point  estimates 
for  CRR 
(including 
intra-off-chart-improvements) of all eyes after 6 months treatment was 23.6% and 25.0% for RHODOS 
idebenone group and EAP, respectively, whereas corresponding rates after 36 months without treatment 
were 31.6% (12/38) and 26.7% (12/45) for RHODOS placebo group and CRS, respectively (request 6 + 
10a).  Corresponding  analyses  on  the  per-patient  revealed  the  following  estimates  after  6  months 
treatment:  32.1%  for  RHODOS  idebeone  and  35.4%  for  EAP,    and  after  36 months  recovery  rates 
observed  without  treatment  were  47.4%  (9/19)  and  39.1%  (9/23)  for  RHODOS  placebo  and  CRS, 
respectively (Requests 17 + 19). CRR (without intra-off-chart-improvements) of patients after 6 months 
treatment was 30.2% and 33.3% for RHODOS idebenone and EAP, respectively, and after 36 months 
without treatment 42.1% (8/19) and 39.1% (9/23) for RHODOS placebo and CRS, respectively (requests 
14 + 16). 
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main evidence for efficacy of Raxone in the treatment of patients with LHON’s disease was derived 
from the pivotal phase II trial RHODOS as complemented by data from a single open label follow-up visit 
(RHODOS-OFU). Further supportive data were available form an Expanded Access Programme (EAP), a 
Natural  History  Case  Record  Survey  (CRS)  and  the  scientific  literature.  The  latter  data  had  not  been 
available in a previous Application made in 2011, that was withdrawn in 2013. 
No  dose-response  studies  were  conducted.  The  choice  of  the  dose  (2x150mg  t.i.d.;  900mg/day) 
investigated in RHODOS and proposed for commercial use was based on the available information prior to 
the start of the RHODOS trial, including extrapolation of non-clinical data for the effective dose preventing 
retinal  ganglion  cell  (RGC)  death  in  animal  models.  Based  on  these  data,  the  selected  dose  was 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 61/89 
 
 
  
 
 
considered to be in a range of a plausible pharmacodynamic effect in humans. The CHMP furthermore 
acknowledged that due to the rarity of the disease, dose-ranging studies would be difficult to conduct. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal RHODOS study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. The 
design and conduct of the study were generally considered acceptable by the CHMP. While the size of the 
study was limited with 85 patients, as was to be expected for a trial in a rare disease, the study population 
was considered largely representative of LHON patients, whereby LHON typically affects young adult 
males. Baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups were balanced including time since disease 
onset and mutation type. However, inclusion of patients with onset of vision loss within 5 years of 
enrolment into the RHODOS trial resulted in a heterogeneous population, with patients being at different 
stages in the disease progression and having different degrees of visual impairment. 
With regards to the EAP, which was primarily established to grant access to Raxone to individual “named” 
LHON patients at the request and under the personal care of a registered physician, it could not be 
excluded with certainty that due to the open-label, uncontrolled nature of the data collection, bias had 
been introduced affecting the outcome of the study. Limitations also applied to the natural history data in 
the CRS due to methodological constraints resulting from the retrospective analysis of patient records and 
differences in data (VA measurements) collection. For these reasons, data from the EAP and CRS were 
only considered supportive. 
The youngest patient recruited in RHODOS was 14 years at the time of enrolment. Limited data were 
available from the EAP and CRS for children and adolescents below the age of 14 years. The CHMP was of 
the opinion that the available data in their entirety justified consideration of adolescents in general for the 
indication, rather than a cut-off age of 14 years as initially proposed by the Applicant. This was also in line 
with the demographics of LHON disease, whereby disease onset has also been observed in younger 
children.  
Patients in RHODOS were treated for a duration of 24 weeks and long-term follow-up data from 
RHODOS-OFU only provided information from a single visit about 2.5 years later for patients who 
previously participated in RHODOS, but did not receive any treatment thereafter. Additional, supportive 
long-term efficacy data were available from the EAP including 45 patients treated with idebenone for a 
least 12 months with a mean treatment duration of 15.4 (range 2.8 – 36.2) months. 
The primary efficacy analysis in RHODOS was based on the ITT population. The Applicant also provided 
re-analyses based on a modified ITT (mITT) population, excluding one patient in the placebo group who 
spontaneously experienced a profound gain in VA commencing already before study start and who was 
therefore considered a “natural history confounder”. However, the exclusion of this patient, who initially 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria, was considered by the CHMP to be contradictory to the ITT principle and 
questionable from a methodological point of view. The effect of inclusion/exclusion of this patients on the 
study results was well known and has been discussed by the CHMP in a previous Application. Exclusion of 
the patient from the analyses rendered the results of the key secondary endpoint statistically significant 
in  favour  of  idebenone  but  not  for  the  primary  endpoint.  This  powerful  effect  of  exclusion  of  a  single 
patient had raised concerns within the CHMP about the extent of the impact of spontaneous regression as 
a possible confounding factor giving the small sample size in RHODOS. Consequently, the robustness of 
the RHODOS results were questioned. The position of the CHMP remained unchanged on this point. For 
the present Application, the efficacy assessment therefore focused on the added evidence obtained from 
the additional data (EAP and CRS) and analyses presented.  
The efficacy assessment was mainly based on changes in visual acuity (VA) including several responder 
analyses, some of which were conducted post-hoc. Supportive non-VA endpoints included colour contrast

vision  and  quality  of  life.  Both  patient-based  and  eye-based  analyses  were  conducted,  which  was 
considered adequate by the CHMP. Analyses by eyes allowed for control of time to disease onset, as onset 
of vision loss may significantly differ between the two eyes of a LHON patients. At the same time, analyses 
at patient level account for the dependency/correlation between the eyes of individual patients. 
Amongst  the  additional  post-hoc  analyses,  the  CHMP  considered  the  responder  analysis  of  clinically 
relevant  recovery  (CRR)  as  defined  by  Carelli  et  al.  (2011)  to  be  a  valuable  marker  for  assessing 
treatment benefit, notwithstanding the usual limitations of the interpretability of post-hoc results. The 
CHMP furthermore acknowledged the concept of nadir, i.e. replacing baseline measurements by the worst 
VA at any time post-Baseline, as such analyses take into account that less severely affected patient with 
more recent disease onset might still not have reached nadir at the time of enrolment and only reach 
nadir in the course of the study. In comparison, for more severely or further progressed patients, nadir 
might have been established already at study baseline. Nevertheless, difficulties in the comparative data 
analyses arose from the lack of continuous VA measurements as discussed below. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint in RHODOS (best recovery of logMAR VA in either right or left eye at 24 weeks of 
treatment) did not reach statistical significance with an estimated mean difference in best recovery of VA 
between  the  idebenone  and  placebo  arm  of  logMAR  -0.06,  equivalent  to  3  letters  on  a  vision  chart 
(p=0.291). The numerical difference in favour of idebenone increased to 5 letters when analyses were 
conducted  on  the  mITT  population.  With  regards  to  the  key  secondary  endpoint,  change  in  best  VA, 
patients  in  the  placebo  group  worsened  by  4 letters  (mean  change  logMAR  0.085),  while  patients  on 
idebenone showed a slight improvement by 1 letter (mean change logMAR 0.035). As could be expected, 
the  difference  increased  for  the  mITT  population  due  to  a  larger  loss  of  vision  in  the  placebo  group 
(difference in log MAR -0.160; 8 letters). The between-group difference was only statistically significant 
for the mITT population.  
Other  pre-defined  secondary  VA  endpoints  showed  broadly  similar  results  numerically  in  favour  of 
idebenone. Patients receiving idebenone also had improved outcomes compared to placebo by the end of 
the study in colour contrast sensitivity and measurements of the retinal nerve fibre layer suggested a 
protective effect of idebenone in patients with disease onset of 6 months or less, albeit the number of 
patients for the majority of these analyses was small.   
With  regards  to  health  related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL),  self-reported  energy  levels  and  clinical  global 
impression  of  change  (CGIC),  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  study  arms.  Moreover,  in 
RHODOS-OFU,  for  the  entire  period  between  RHODOS  Baseline  to  follow-up  visit,  there  was  a  small 
worsening of the HRQoL score in the idebenone group (-1.7%) compared to a small improvement in the 
placebo group (2.4 %; p=0.205). While this finding might be explained by a lack of sensitivity of the 
HRQoL questionnaire used, which was originally developed for patient who underwent cataract surgery, it 
remained unclear if a possible treatment induced improvement in vision translated into benefits for the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Amongst the post-hoc responders analyses, the results for the proportion of patients/eyes with off-chart 
VA at Baseline who were able to read at least one full line on-chart at Week 24 were considered of clinical 
relevance  by  the  CHMP  as  such  a  recovery  was  considered  an  important  categorical  change.  In  the 
sub-group of patients with off-chart vision in both eyes, 28% (7/25) of the Raxone-treated patients were 
able to read at least 5 letters on-chart at Week 24, but none of the 13 placebo treated patients (p=0.072). 
Similar results were obtained for the analysis per eyes. This analysis did however not adequately account 
for time since onset.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 63/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Supportive evidence for a treatment effect of idebenone was furthermore available from the post hoc 
analysis of the proportion of patients with CRR of VA from Baseline. A higher proportion of patients in the 
Raxone group (16/53 patients, 30.2%) than in the placebo group (ITT: 3/29 patients, 10.3%, mITT: 2/28 
patients, 7.1%) had CRR in at least one eye. The between-group difference was statistically significant 
when analyses were conducted on the mITT population (p=0.0234). Similar results were obtained when 
CRR was determined compared to patients’ nadir.  
Additional supportive data from the EAP showed that 50% (24/48) of patients and 38.5% (37/96) of all 
eyes  had  CRR  from  nadir  (in  at  least  one  eye  for  the  analysis  at  patient  level)  at  the  last  available 
assessment.  In  comparison,  data  from  the  natural  history  CRS  showed  that  only  31.1%  (23/74)  of 
untreated patients experienced spontaneous CRR from nadir.  
Comparison across data sets including RHODOS study data was however hampered by the heterogeneity 
of patients and lack of continuous VA measurements over time, which affected determination of nadir. To 
enable  bridging  of  data,  additional  responder  analyses  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  abandoning  the 
concept  of  nadir  and  differentiating  between  off-chart  and  on-chart  vision  as  well  as  study  duration. 
Based  on  these  analyses,  across  data  sets  and  when  pooling  data,  generally  a  larger  proportion  of 
patients/eyes  treated  with  idebenone  with  CRR  were  observed  compared  to  placebo.  Some  of  the 
analyses  were  based  on  small  subgroup  sizes  and  calculation  of  odds  ratios  did  not  account  for 
confounding factors such as time to disease onset. Visual control of the distribution of time since onset 
however did not give particular rise of concern  for confounding. Thus, while still not demonstrating a 
clear,  distinct  treatment  effect  of  idebenone,  the  requested  analyses  showed  a  consistent  pattern  of 
beneficial trends in favour of idebenone, although in the interpretation of these results it has to be kept in 
mind that response rates following different response definitions are highly correlated by nature.   
Another observation when comparing data across data sets was the consistently lower rates of CRR in 
RHODOS compared to the EAP and the CRS. In fact, the proportion of patients with CRR in the natural 
history  outcome  population  of  the  CRS  (31.1%,  23/74  patients)  was  similar  to  the  results  for  the 
idebenone treatment group in RHODOS (34.0%, 18/53 patients). The Applicant argued that the lower 
rates of CRR in RHODOS were due to the shorter duration of treatment. Indeed, when comparing data 
across data sets from untreated patients after 36 months, there was a higher proportion of patients/eyes 
with CRR compared to treated patients after 6 months.  
These results created uncertainties of the long-term benefit of idebenone-treatment despite the observed 
trend for an improvement in vision in RHODOS-OFU over time. In RHODOS-OFU, after a mean time of 2.5 
years from Week 24 in RHODOS, similar improvements in VA were observed for the idebenone and the 
placebo group. The in-between group difference was maintained, suggesting that the benefit obtained 
with  idebenone  after  6 months  treatment  persisted  even  after  withdrawal  of  treatment.  The  overall 
tendency  of  improvement  in  vision  in  patients  appeared  to  be  mainly  driven  by  patients  with  shorter 
disease  history.  During  early  stages  of  the  disease, LHON  patients  can  learn  to  cope  with  the  central 
scotoma by using peripheral vision instead of foveal vision for object recognition. However, due to the 
lack  of  intermediate  assessments  in  RHODOS-OFU,  the  detailed  time  courses  for  changes  in  both 
treatment arms from the end of RHODOS to the OFU visit were not known.  
Limited support for an additional benefit of treatment beyond 6 months was available from the EAP. Of the 
patients in the EAP for whom 6 (± 3 months, n=62) or 12 month (± 3 months n=47) VA assessments 
were available, CRR had occurred in 19 (30.6%) patients and 30/124 (24.2%) of eyes at the 6 month 
assessment  and  in  17  (36.2%)  patients  and  28/94  (29.8%)  of  eyes  at  the  12 month  assessment. 
Nevertheless, based on the available data at the time of this report, no firm conclusions could be drawn 
and no recommendation on treatment duration could be made. To address this issue, the CHMP was of the 
opinion that further long-term efficacy data should be collected post marketing.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 64/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Finally,  several  subgroup  analyses  have  been  conducted  on  the  RHODOS  data  including  analyses  by 
disease onset, mutation type, age and smoking status. Despite the limitations of such analyses due to the 
small group sizes, compared to the overall population generally larger effect sizes in favour of idebenone 
were observed in patients with G11778A and G3460A mutations, patients with disease onset less than a 
year as well as non-smokers and younger patients. Univariate analysis for possible prognostic factors for 
treatment  response  showed  that  the  T14484C  mutation  was  associated  with  a  higher  proportion  of 
responding patients compared to non-responders, which was expected due to the more benign course of 
the disease in patients with this mutation. However, based on the available data, it could not be excluded 
that patients with this mutation might benefit from idebenone treatment as well. This was in line with a 
recommendation  from  experts  consulted  in  a  previous  Application.  No  other  prognostic  factors  were 
identified as influential for the responder rate.  
With regards to the impact of time since disease onset, in contrast to the subgroup analyses in RHODOS, 
data  from  the  EAP  showed  an  increase  in  the  CRR  rate  from  nadir  apparently  associated  with  late 
treatment. Additional analyses performed by the Applicant, however, suggested that early treatment with 
idebenone ameliorated the degree of VA loss at nadir, thus explaining the reduced effect size for CRR 
responder  rates  in  patients  with  more  recent  onset  of  vision  loss.  The  outcome  for  early  versus 
late-treated eyes was similar. A plausible explanation for the mechanism of action underlying the clinical 
observations could be that rapid vision loss at disease onset is caused by RGC inactivation but, as long as 
the RGCs remain viable, recovery of vision is possible through restoration of mitochondrial function. The 
natural  history  of  LHON  suggests  that  recovery  of  vision  is  possible  even  after  years  of  vision  loss, 
supporting the notion that inactive RGCs can remain viable for extended periods of time. Therefore, the 
CHMP considered that the indication should not be constrained by time to disease onset. 
Evidence from the published literature for efficacy of idebenone in the treatment of LHON was rather 
limited and affected by publication or selection bias. Overall, the submitted literature seemed to indicate 
a favourable effect of idebenone. However no firm conclusions could be drawn from these data alone.   
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on the 
clinical efficacy of Raxone under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive, nor 
was  it  considered  feasible  to  generate  a  comprehensive  data  set  mainly  due  to  the  rarity  of  LHON’s 
disease. Furthermore, at the time of this report, idebenone was already used to treat LHON patients in 
clinical  practice,  whereby  neither  physicians  nor  patients  would  be  prepared  to  participate  in  a 
placebo-controlled trial, thus preventing the generation of new controlled data to confirm the outcomes 
observed in RHODOS, the EAP and the CRS.  
Following an oral explanation by the Applicant, the CHMP agreed that it was not feasible to produce a 
comprehensive data set under normal conditions of use of Raxone. The CHMP was furthermore of the view 
that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances should be granted subject to a number of 
specific  obligations  in  line  with  a  program  of  studies  proposed  by  the  Applicant.  Within  this  program, 
additional efficacy data should be generated through an open label interventional study in LHON patients 
treated with idebenone with an external natural history control based on an extended case record survey. 
This  study  should  also  provide  data  on  long-term  efficacy  suitable  to  make  recommendations  on  the 
duration of idebenone treatment. Furthermore, follow-up data from the ongoing EAP should be provided. 
In addition, a drug exposure registry should be conducted (see section 2.6.1. ). While this study is mainly 
intended for the generation of further safety data, data on long-term effectiveness and lack or loss of 
therapeutic response should also be generated. The specific obligations will be reviewed annually and 
continuation of the authorisation shall be linked to these annual re-assessments.

2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For the evaluation of the efficacy of Raxone in the treatment of LHON, the CHMP considered the totality of 
the  available  data,  including  in  addition  to  the  pivotal  RHODOS  trial,  data  from  the  EAP,  the  natural 
history CRS and the scientific literature. Notably, the CRS represented a rather unique dataset enabling a 
better understanding of the natural course of LHON’s disease. Overall, the CHMP was of the view that data 
from the EAP and the CRS provided independent supportive evidence in favour of a treatment effect of 
idebenone, despite the limitations of some of the post-hoc analyses conducted across data sets, thus 
addressing concerns about the robustness of the RHODOS data.  
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  there  was  a  consistent  trend  of  a  beneficial  effect  of 
idebenone throughout the analyses conducted and across all available datasets which, while still lacking 
statistically  significance  for  the  majority  of  endpoints  and  when  the  usual  methodological  rigour  was 
applied, was considered sufficiently convincing to support the Application for Raxone in the treatment of 
visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with LHON.  
However, the CHMP considered that the available data set on the clinical efficacy was not comprehensive 
and therefore considered the following measures necessary to generate additional efficacy data in the 
context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances: 
• 
• 
• 
The  MAH  should  conduct  and  submit  the  results  of  an  external  natural  history  controlled, 
open-label  intervention  study  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Raxone  in  the  treatment  of 
LHON patients, including long-term treatment. 
The MAH should maintain and extend the Historical Case Record Survey of Visual Acuity Data 
from Patients with LHON to serve as the external control to the open label study. 
The MAH should follow up patients in the existing Expanded Access Programme and submit the 
final results. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety  data  in  support  of  this  Application  were  available  from  the  pivotal  double-blind,  randomised, 
placebo-controlled study in LHON patients (RHODOS, SNT-II-003) as well the single open-label follow-up 
visit  (RHODOS-OFU,  SNT-II-003  OFU).  Additional  supportive  data  were  presented  from  the  clinical 
development  program  for  Friedreich’s  ataxia  (FRDA),  as  well  as  several  Phase  I  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers. In summary, the following clinical data were reviewed: 
• 
• 
• 
Pivotal Phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in LHON patients RHODOS 
and observational follow-up study in patients completing RHODOS (RHODOS-OFU). 
Three  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  multi-centre  studies  in  FRDA:  NICOSIA 
(SNT-II-002),  IONIA  (SNT-III-002)  and  MICONOS  (SNT-III-001).  In  addition,  data  from 
open-label, long-term extension trial of MICONOS and IONIA were provided. 
Four Phase I studies in healthy volunteers: SNT-I-001, SNT-I-002, SNT-I-003, and SNT-I-004. 
•  Data from post-marketing surveillance and EAP (see section ‘post-marketing experience’). 
The  Phase  I  studies  were  considered  to  provide  limited  safety  data  as  they  were  conducted  in  small 
numbers of healthy volunteers, with a short duration of treatment (maximum 2 weeks dosing). For this 
reason and since there was no major safety finding in these studies, the data are not further discussed in 
this section.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)

Safety was assessed by evaluation of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), i.e., events which 
started or worsened during the study treatment. Relationship to study drug was defined as probable, 
possible,  unlikely  or  unrelated.  For  analysis  purposes,  the  relationship  was  converted  to  ‘related’ 
(probable,  possible  or  unlikely)  or  ‘unrelated’  (unrelated).  All  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  considered 
related to treatment if the causal relationship was unknown or missing. Additionally, physical examination 
data, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and haematological and biochemical laboratory parameters in 
blood and urine samples were assessed. 
Patient exposure 
Overall, safety data were available for 311 subjects treated with idebenone and 124 treated with placebo. 
Of the idebenone treated subjects, 242 received idebenone at doses ≥900 mg/day. The safety population 
comprised both male and female subjects aged between 8 and 70 years, mostly of Caucasian/white race. 
LHON patients 
The  Safety  Population  of Raxone  included  85  patients,  55  treated  with  idebenone  900mg/day  and  30 
treated with placebo. Of the 55 patients enrolled in the idebenone arm, 52 subjects were exposed for 24 
weeks (mean exposure time of 192 days). Three (3) and 4 patients discontinued in the active and the 
placebo treatment arms, respectively, including one patient in each arm who withdrew due to an adverse 
event.  Patient  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  are  summarised  in  Table  2  and  Table  3  in 
section 2.5.2.  
In RHODOS-OFU, patients were off-treatment, but 5 patients reported use of idebenone between Week 
24 of RHODOS and the RHODOS-OFU visit.   
FRDA patients 
In the FRDA trials, patients were dosed based on their body weight (two different doses based on ≤ or > 
45kg).  A  total  of  256  FRDA  patients  received  idebenone  for  up  to  12  months,  including  69  patients 
receiving  180/360 mg/day,  92  patients  receiving  450/900  mg/day  and  95  patients  having  had 
1350/2250  mg/day.  A  total  of  94  subjects  received  placebo.  Overall,  332  subjects  completed  the 
respective  treatment  periods,  including  243  who  had  received  idebenone  and  89  who  had  received 
placebo.  
One hundred sixty (160) subjects with FRDA were exposed to idebenone for 12 months. Furthermore, a 
total of 68 subjects completed the IONIA study and entered the open-label, 12 months, single group 
extension study receiving 1350/2250 mg idebenone/day. The majority of subjects (86.8%) completed 
the extension study and the mean exposure was 338.5 days. In addition, 200 subjects completed the 
MICONOS  study  and  entered  the  single  group  extension  study,  which  ran  for  24  months.  Doses  of 
1350/2250 mg/day were used and 139 subjects (69.5% of enrolled patients) completed the study with a 
mean exposure over all previous treatment groups in the main study of 629.6 days.   
Adverse events 
LHON’s disease 
In the RHODOS study, the majority of subjects had at least one AE (89% for idebenone and 87% for 
placebo).  The  most  common  AEs  (those  with  an  occurrence  of  >5%  in  either  group,  regardless  of 
causality) are collated in Table 14. Overall, the incidence of all AEs and treatment related AEs were low 
and similar or lower on idebenone compared with placebo.  
The AEs reported by ≥10.0% of subjects on idebenone at the MedDRA preferred term (PT) level were: 
nasopharyngitis  (25.5%  of  subjects  affected),  headache  (23.6%),  and  influenza,  blood  triglycerides 
increased and cough (10.9% each). Headache, nasopharyngitis and cough were more frequent in the 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)

idebenone group than the placebo group. In addition, dizziness  was reported at a higher incidence in 
subjects receiving idebenone (5.5%) compared to subjects receiving placebo (0%). 
Left  ventricular  hypertrophy  (LVH)  was  reported  for  four  subjects  (7.3%)  on  idebenone  but  was  not 
reported in the placebo group. Likewise, dizziness was reported for three subjects (5.5%) on idebenone 
but was not experienced by any subject in the placebo group. None of these AEs were of severe intensity 
and, with the exception of one episode of LVH, none were considered by the investigator to be related to 
idebenone treatment. The four cases of LVH were all reported by the same investigational site on the 
basis of the ECG readings only and the diagnosis was not supported by clinical or ultrasound evidence. 
The  majority  of  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  only  two  subjects  receiving  idebenone 
experienced severe AEs. One patient had a severe headache considered unrelated to treatment, and the 
other had abnormal liver function test results that were considered possibly related to treatment and led 
to discontinuation. 
Five subjects (four treated with idebenone and one treated with placebo) experienced treatment-related 
AEs. Blood triglycerides increased was reported for one subject in each treatment group, whereby the 
patient in the placebo arm also reported the treatment-related AE alanine aminotransferase increased. 
Furthermore,  LVH,  Wolff-Parkinson-White  syndrome,  and  liver  function  tests  abnormal  were  each 
reported for one subject (1.8%) in the idebenone group.

Table 14 – Common AEs (Reported by ≥5% of Subjects) in the RHODOS Study 
Of the 60 patients included in the Safety Population of RODOS-OFU, there was one SAE of hypertensive 
emergency experienced on the day of the RHODOS-OFU visit, which was over 3 years after completing

treatment with idebenone in RHODOS. The investigator considered this event not related to study drug 
received in RHODOS. No other relevant safety findings were derived from RHODOS-OFU. 
FRDA 
In each of the FRDA studies, the majority of subjects had at least one AE (over 90% for all idebenone 
doses combined and over 80% for placebo). The most common AEs reported in all three double-blind 
studies (NICOSIA, IONIA and MICONOS) were headache (33.2%), nasopharyngitis (28.5%), diarrhoea 
(18.8%) and nausea (16%). The incidence of these events was generally similar between idebenone and 
placebo groups. 
Treatment-related AE reported by ≥ 10.0% of subjects on idebenone (all doses combined) and placebo in 
each of the three studies (NICOSIA, IONIA and MICONOS) were headache and nausea. Other 
treatment-related AEs reported by ≥ 10.0% of subjects in individual FRDA studies included diarrhoea 
(16.2%) and dyspepsia (10.8%) in NICOSIA, abdominal pain upper (13.0%) and fatigue (10.9%) in 
IONIA, and diarrhoea (12.7%) in MICONOS. 
Diarrhea  and  vomiting  were  reported  as  treatment-related  AEs  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  subjects 
receiving idebenone compared to subjects receiving placebo in the FRDA studies.  
No clear dose relationship for the incidence of AEs or treatment-related AEs was seen. 
•  NICOSIA  
In the Nicosia-FRDA study, the AEs reported by ≥10.0% of subjects on idebenone (all doses combined) at 
the  MedDRA  PT  level  were:  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (48.6%  of  subjects  affected),  headache 
(43.2%),  myalgia  and  gastroenteritis  (27.0%  each),  nausea  (21.6%),  diarrhea  (16.2%),  dyspepsia 
(13.5%),  fall  and  white  blood  cells  decreased  (10.8%  each).  The  corresponding  incidences  for  these 
events in the placebo group were: upper respiratory tract infection (36.4%), headache (36.4%), myalgia 
(18.2%), gastroenteritis (9.1%), nausea (27.3%), diarrhea (0.0%), dyspepsia (1.9%), fall (0.0%) and 
WBC decreased (27.3%).  
The incidence of diarrhoea was higher on idebenone (all doses combined) than placebo (16.2% versus 
0%). The incidence of upper respiratory tract infection, headache, myalgia, gastroenteritis, dyspepsia, 
and  falls  was  higher  with  active  treatment  than  with  placebo  but  did  not  appear  to  be  dose-related. 
Fatigue and pyrexia were more common in the subjects exposed to idebenone (8.1% for both) compared 
to  subjects  exposed  to  placebo  (0%  for  both).  These  AEs  also  appeared  not  to  be  dose-related.  The 
absolute number of AEs were small in most cases.   
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, one subject receiving 180/360 mg/day idebenone 
experienced severe nausea and vomiting and one subject receiving placebo experienced severe angina 
pectoris. These severe events were considered severe AEs (SAEs). 
The incidences of treatment-related headache and diarrhea were notably higher on idebenone (27.0% 
and 16.2%, all doses combined) compared with placebo (18.2% and 0%). 
• 
IONIA  
The AEs reported by ≥10.0% of subjects on idebenone (all doses combined) at the MedDRA PT level were: 
headache (39.1% of subjects affected), abdominal pain upper (17.4%), nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, upper 
respiratory  tract  infection  and  muscle  spasms  (15.2%  each),  diarrhoea,  fall,  pain  in  extremity  and 
dizziness  (13.0%  each),  nasopharyngitis,  limb  injury  and  pharyngolaryngeal  pain  (10.9%  each).  The 
corresponding incidences for these events in the placebo group were: headache (37.5%), abdominal pain 
upper  (4.2%),  nausea,  fatigue  and  pyrexia  (12.5%  each),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (37.5%), 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 70/89 
 
 
  
 
 
muscle spasms (8.3%), diarrhoea (12.5%), fall (4.2%), pain in extremity (4.2%), dizziness (12.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (0%), limb injury (12.5%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (16.7%).  
Consequently, the incidences of abdominal pain upper, upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, 
falls,  pain  in  extremity  and  nasopharyngitis  were  notably  higher  in  the  idebenone  group  (all  doses 
combined)  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Chromaturia  was  also  noted  at  a  higher  incidence  in  subject 
receiving idebenone  compared  to  subjects  receiving  placebo  (6.5%  versus  0%).  The  incidence  in  the 
IONIA extension study was 10.3%. Of these AEs, abdominal pain upper, fall, and chromaturia were more 
common at the higher idebenone dose. It should also be noted that the absolute number of AEs was 
limited in most cases. 
No  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  450/900  mg/day  idebenone  treatment  group  but  three  subjects  in  the 
1350/2250 mg/day group reported SAEs (all considered unrelated to treatment) including one case of 
severe chest pain on two occasions and severe migraine, one case of severe pain in extremity and one 
case of severe idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and severe headache. Furthermore, one subject in 
the placebo group reported a SAE of dizziness postural considered unrelated to treatment. 
The incidence of treatment-related abdominal pain upper and diarrhea was notably higher on idebenone 
(13.0% and 8.7%, all doses combined) compared with placebo (4.2% for both).  
•  MICONOS  
The AEs reported by ≥10.0% of subjects on idebenone (all doses combined) at the MedDRA PT level were: 
nasopharyngitis (39.3% of subjects affected), headache (29.5%), diarrhoea (20.8%), nausea (15.0%), 
back pain (13.3%), vomiting (12.1%) and cough (11.0%). The corresponding incidences for these events 
in  the  placebo  group  were:  nasopharyngitis  (35.6%),  headache  (39.0%),  diarrhoea  (13.6%),  nausea 
(15.3%), back pain (10.2%), vomiting (3.4%) and cough (10.2%). The incidence of vomiting was notably 
higher on idebenone (all doses combined) than on placebo. 
A total of 11 cases of bronchitis were reported. The reporting incidence was higher in idebenone-treated 
patients (5.7%) compared with placebo (1.6%). 
SAEs  were  reported  by  19  subjects  on  idebenone  (11.0%)  including  5  subjects  each  in  the  180/360 
mg/day idebenone and 450/900 mg/day idebenone treatment groups and 9 subjects in the 1350/2250 
mg/day  idebenone  group.  One  subject  each  in  the  180/360  mg/day  idebenone  group  (severe  visual 
acuity reduced and fatigue) and 450/900 mg/day idebenone group (severe chest pain) reported SAEs 
that  were  considered  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  Six  subjects  (10.2%)  in  the  placebo  group 
reported SAEs, a similar incidence to that observed in the idebenone (all doses combined) group. Two 
subjects had SAEs considered possibly related to study treatment, one case of severe fatigue and anxiety 
and one case of severe flatulence and abdominal discomfort.   
Treatment-related  AEs  reported  by  ≥10.0%  of  subjects  on  idebenone  (all  doses  combined)  at  the 
MedDRA PT level were headache (14.5%), diarrhea (12.7%) and nausea (11.0%). The corresponding 
incidences for these events on placebo were: headache (27.1%), diarrhea (8.5%) and nausea (13.6%). 
The incidence of treatment-related nausea and gastroenteritis increased with idebenone dose. Headache 
was more frequently reported by subjects on placebo than on idebenone. Treatment-related diarrhea, 
vomiting,  back  pain,  cough  and  pruritus  were  more  frequently  reported  by  subjects  on  idebenone 
(12.7%, 6.4%, 4.6%, 4.6% and 2.3%, respectively) than on placebo (8.5%, 3.4%, 0%, 0% and 0%). 
The incidence of treatment-related back pain increased with idebenone dose, the others AEs did not. 
Comparison of AEs in LHON versus FRDA 
The following AEs were reported at a higher incidence in LHON subjects compared to FRDA: LVH was 
reported  by  four  subjects  (7.3%)  with  LHON  receiving  idebenone  but  was  not  reported  in  any  FRDA 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 71/89 
 
 
  
 
 
subjects receiving idebenone. Several AEs representing laboratory abnormalities were reported in LHON 
subjects that had not been reported as AEs in the FRDA subjects but all of these were reported at a similar 
or higher incidence in the placebo group. 
Other AEs observed with a higher incidence in LHON versus FRDA patients were constipation, influenza, 
alanine aminotransferse increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood triglycerides 
increased, cough, oropharyngeal pain, pruritus generalized and rash. 
Furthermore,  dizziness  was  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  subjects  receiving  idebenone  (5.5%) 
compared to subjects receiving placebo (0%) in the RHODOS study, but no difference in incidence was 
observed in the FRDA studies.  
Serious adverse event (SAEs)/deaths/other significant events 
•  Death 
No deaths occurred in the RHODOS study and no deaths occurred during the clinical program for FDRA. 
One patient died of myocardial infarction during the MICONOS-extension study. The investigator 
assessed the causal relationship between the event and the study drug as unrelated and attributed the 
event to a pre-existing condition. 
•  SAEs 
SAEs observed in the RHODOS and FRDA studies are described above, for each study separately, in detail. 
Two SAEs occurred in the RHODOS study, however, they were considered unrelated to the study drug. In 
the NICOSIA and MICONOS studies, the incidence of SAEs was lower or similar on idebenone and placebo. 
The proportions of subjects with SAEs was higher in the MICONOS study compared with the IONIA and 
NICOSIA studies, which was likely due to the longer duration of the study. Although the IONIA study had 
an overall higher incidence of SAEs on idebenone compared with placebo, all SAEs were considered 
unrelated the treatment. Four subjects experienced SAEs during the IONIA extension study, which were 
considered not related to treatment. During the MICONOS extension study, no treatment-related SAEs 
were reported.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
There was no evidence observed for an effect over time on any haematology parameter after treatment 
with idebenone in the RHODOS study. Results for idebenone were generally similar to those with placebo. 
At  Week  4,  Week  12  and  Week  24,  only  small  mean  changes  from  Baseline  were  observed  in  each 
treatment  group.  Values  for  mean  corpuscular  haemoglobin  and  mean  corpuscular  volume  above  the 
normal range were the abnormalities most commonly seen in both treatment groups. However, these 
were also seen at Baseline and may be related to chronic consumption of alcohol, which is known to play 
an important role in the clinical expression of LHON (Kirkman et al., 2009b). 
Cases  of  low  white  blood  cell  counts  occurred  during  the  NICOSIA  study,  but  these  were  evenly 
distributed  between  the  placebo  and  idebenone  groups,  and  in  all  but  one  case  were  normal  on 
re-checking  at  a  local  laboratory,  suggesting  that  delays  in  shipping  the  samples  may  have  been 
responsible for the findings. However, one case was considered probably related to idebenone use due to 
positive  de-challenge.  Furthermore,  elevated  haemoglobin  and  haematocrit  values  were  reported  for 
subjects in all treatment groups throughout the study.  
No meaningful difference of hematologic parameters such as neutrophils, lymphocytes and white blood 
cell count was observed during the course of IONIA across active and placebo groups. Normal to high 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 72/89 
 
 
  
 
 
shifts were more frequent with active treatment than with placebo for three parameters only, red blood 
cells, hematocrit and haemoglobin, but these findings were not considered clinically significant. In IONIA 
extension study, there was one case of a slight decrease in the levels of mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration. A marked drop in the white blood cell count was seen at one visit in two subjects. Both 
cases were deemed by the investigator as unrelated to the study drug. 
In MICONOS, a slight but consistent decrease of leukocytes compared to Baseline in all idebenone study 
groups was observed. In none of the subjects was the decrease considered clinically notable (i.e. <2 x 
109/l).  
Biochemistry results 
There  was  no  evidence  observed  for  an  effect  over  time  on  any  clinical  chemistry  parameter  after 
treatment with idebenone in RHODOS. Results for idebenone were generally similar to those with placebo. 
At  Week  4,  Week  12  and  Week  24,  only  small  mean  changes  from  Baseline  were  observed  in  each 
treatment  group.  A  number  of  subjects  had  individual  clinical  chemistry  values  that  were  outside  the 
laboratory normal range. However, the numbers with abnormal values were similar at Baseline and after 
treatment and were also generally similar for idebenone and placebo.  
Triglyceride value above the normal range was the most commonly seen abnormality, seen already at 
Baseline in both treatment groups. Other noteworthy abnormalities included high levels of 
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and transaminases, which were also seen at Baseline. There were 3 
abnormal values observed at Baseline, compared to 3 abnormal values at the end of treatment in 
idebenone treated patients. One patient had an abnormal (>3xULN) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
level at Baseline, which was normal at the end of treatment, and one patient who had a normal AST level 
at Baseline, presented with an abnormal AST level (>5xULN) at the end of treatment. However, this 
patient also presented with an abnormal GGT level at Baseline, thus indicating a high likelihood to have a 
pre-existing medical hepatic issue. Another idebenone-randomised patient presented with abnormal 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST and GGT at both Baseline and end of treatment. One patient 
discontinued the RHODOS study because of abnormal liver function test.  
In  the  NICOSIA  study,  there  were  few  reported  electrolyte  values  and  values  for  glucose,  albumin, 
bilirubin, protein, and for AST, ALT and creatine kinase outside the normal ranges in idebenone-treated 
subjects. The incidences were comparable to those seen in the placebo group, and no dose-dependent 
trends  were  observed.  There  were  a  number  of  high  values  for  lactate  dehydrogenase  reported  in  all 
treatment groups. However, there was no difference between the combined idebenone-treated group and 
the placebo group. High uric acid was reported more frequently on idebenone than on placebo, but was 
not considered of clinical significance. 
There were no clinically relevant changes over time for any biochemistry parameters in the IONIA study, 
with mean values generally being within the respective normal ranges at baseline and over the 24-week 
treatment period. Some small changes of interest, albeit non-clinically significant, were noted for albumin 
levels,  AST,  and  creatine  kinase.  In  the  IONIA  extension  study,  mean  values  of  glucose  remained 
generally stable but 6 subjects (9%) experienced a drop in glucose levels of at least 2 mmol/L during the 
course of this study. Each of these subjects had also received treatment with idebenone during the IONIA 
study.  
There were no noteworthy findings for changes in biochemistry parameters or for shifts in biochemistry 
parameters in the MICONOS study. No drug related clinically significant haematology abnormalities were 
seen. There were no subjects with AST levels >3 times ULN (upper limit of normal) and only one subject 
on placebo with ALT levels >3xULN. There were some notably abnormal values observed for bilirubin 
(both  with  idebenone  and  placebo),  creatinine  (idebenone  only)  and  creatinine  clearance  (idebenone 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 73/89 
 
 
  
 
 
only) in a few subjects but for the most part values for these subjects were also notably abnormal at 
screening or Baseline. 
Urinalysis results 
There was no evidence observed for an effect of idebenone treatment on urinalysis in the RHODOS and 
IONIA study.  
In NICOSIA, there were no significant findings in urinalysis other than the occurrence of pink tinged urine 
reported as a possibly treatment-related AE of chromaturia for one subject in the 450/900 mg/day group, 
and cloudy urine observed in another subject in the 180/360 mg/day group. 
In  IONIA,  4  subjects  receiving  idebenone  experienced  chromaturia,  which  were  considered  clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities. 
There were no noteworthy findings for changes in urinalysis parameters in the MICONOS study. 
No clinically significant changes over time were observed in the extension studies. 
Vital signs  
There were no significant changes in vital signs reported. 
Safety in special populations 
Special populations have not been specifically studied. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been performed in support of this Application and no case 
reports of drug interactions have been received from post-marketing data. 
A  number  of  in  vitro  studies  have  been  performed  to  assess  the  effects  of  idebenone  and  its 
structurally-closest related metabolite QS10. The results are presented and discussed in section 2.4.  In 
summary, the data showed that idebenone and its metabolite QS10 do not exert systemic inhibition of 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations of idebenone or QS10. 
In addition, no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 was observed. However, inhibition of P-gp with 
possible exposure increases of of P-gp substrates.. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One subject withdrew from the RHODOS study due to abnormal liver function test results, which occurred 
after 35 days of treatment start with idebenone 900 mg/day and were severe in intensity and considered 
possibly related to treatment. 
No subjects discontinued the NICOSIA or IONIA studies prematurely due to an AE. However, in the IONIA 
extension study, two subjects with SAEs withdrew due to pregnancy and general poor health (reason for 
withdrawal  was  recorded  as  other),  respectively.  Additionally,  one  subject  had  discontinued  study 
treatment for an AE of disorientation but was withdrawn from the study due to poor compliance. In the 
MICONOS study, the number of subjects who permanently discontinued study drug due to AEs was low, 
with a similar percentage of subjects discontinuing on idebenone (2.9%, 5 subjects) and placebo (3.4%, 
2  subjects).  Amongst  these  subjects,  there  was  none  who  discontinued  treatment  on  the  highest 
idebenone dose (1350/2250 mg/day), but one subject (1.8%) on 450/900 mg/day and 4 subjects (7.0%) 
on  180/360  mg/day  idebenone  dicontinued.  The  higher  frequency  of  AEs  leading  to  study  drug 
discontinuation in the 180/360 mg/day idebenone group was mainly due to the occurrence of pregnancy 
in  two  subjects.  Other  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  included  gastrointestinal  events  (e.g.  nausea, 
diarrhea,  vomiting  and  gastritis)  and  supraventricular  extrasystoles  in  the  active  treatment  groups. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 74/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Supraventricular extrasystoles was also reported as a SAE, but was not considered by the investigator to 
be related to study treatment.  
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing  data  were  available  from  Takeda  Pharmaceuticals  for  Mnesis,  45  mg  idebenone  oral 
tablet, intended for the treatment of degenerative and vascular cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s 
disease. The patients population exposed to idebenone from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2013 was estimated 
at  approximately  130,784  patient-years.  As  of  end  of  December  2013,  57  AEs  (21  serious  and  36 
non-serious) were reported mainly from Switzerland and France. Of the serious reports, one described 
fulminant hepatitis and multi-organ failure in a 40-year old male subject with FRDA. The events occurred 
more than 4 years after initiation of therapy with idebenone. The subject had a medical history of severe 
hypertrophic cardiopathy and was taking numerous concomitant medications including acetylsalicylate 
lysine, spironolactone, baclofen, bisoprolol fumarate, perindopril, alprazolam, paroxetine and macrogol. 
Additionally, a poorly documented case of cytolytic hepatitis was reported for a 20-year-old male patient 
who was treated with Mnesis (idebenone) 7 mg/kg for FRDA. 
In  addition,  post-marketing  data  were  available  from  the  Canadian  market  where  Santhera  used  to 
market idebenone for FRDA. In addition, in September 2009, Santhera started a Named Patient supply 
program (NPP) which ensures the distribution of idebenone. In Canada, Santhera marketed idebenone 
150  mg  oral  tablets,  under  a  Notice  of  Compliance  with  Conditions  for  the  indication  of  symptomatic 
management of patients with Friedreich’s Ataxia between July 2008 and April 2013, when the product 
was withdrawn from the market due to the failure of further clinical trials confirming efficacy. As of end of 
April 2013, 118 AEs were reported from Canada, of which 28 were serious and 90 were non-serious. The 
AEs most frequently reported were minor gastrointestinal events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
abdominal pain. 
Expanded Access Program (EAP) 
During the course of the assessment, the Applicant provided an updated EAP report (clinical cut off on 
20 March 2015)  including  93  patients  in  the  safety  population.  Of  these,  76  had  received  Raxone 
treatment for at least 6 months and 53 for at least 12 months. The maximum treatment period was 36 
months (2 patients) and the mean treatment duration was 13.3 (range 0- 36.2) months. For a summary 
of demographics and baseline characteristics, see section 2.5.3.2.  
There were no deaths in the EAP. A total of 17 AEs were reported from 10 patients. The most frequently 
reported AE was mild diarrhoea. The severity of reported AEs were classified as mild (65%), moderate 
(24%)  or  unknown  (11%).  Four  AEs  in  three  patients  were  classified  as  serious.  The  four  SAEs  were 
osteonecrosis, bipolar disorder, adenoid cystic carcinoma and pneumonia. All four SAEs were considered 
by the treating physician and by the Applicant as not related to Raxone treatment.  
Five (5) AEs in 4 patients were classified as being related to Raxone treatment by either the reporting 
physician or by the Applicant. These five events were nausea and headache, hepatic enzyme increased, 
diarrhoea and white blood cell count decreased in one patient each.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  main  support  for  the  safety  assessment  of  this  Application  was  derived  from  RHODOS  and  its 
extension  RHODOS-OFU  investigating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Raxone  in  the  treatment  of  LHON’s 
disease.  Additional  safety  information  was  available  from  three  Phase  III  trials  in  Friedreich’s  ataxia 
(FRDA), another rare mitochondrial disease, and two related open-label extension studies. The proposed 
dose recommendation for LHON (900 mg/day, 2x150mg tablets t.i.d.) was comparable to the doses used 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 75/89 
 
 
  
 
 
in the FRDA studies (180-2250 mg/day) and hence, data from the FRDA clinical program were considered 
supportive. Taken together, LHON and FRDA studies compromised safety data in 242 patients exposed to 
≥900 mg/day idebenone. Duration of exposure was 6 months in the RHODOS study, up to 12 months in 
the FRDA studies and in open-label studies up to 24 months. 
Furthermore, post marketing data were available from FRDA subjects and Alzheimer patients treated with 
idebenone from Canada, Switzerland and France. Safety data were also available from the EAP. 
From a demographic point of view, the population studied in RHODOS was considered by the CHMP to be 
representative of the population suffering from LHON. However, although explained by the rarity of the 
disease, the low patient exposure to idebenone in RHODOS (55 patients with LHON treated for 6 months) 
provided limited safety data in the target population. Furthermore, only limited information was available 
for the safety of long-term use of idebenone, which was consequently considered missing information in 
the RMP. Of the 93 patients in the safety population of the EAP, 53 had received idebenone treatment for 
at least 12 months. 
The  lack  of  studies  in  specific  populations  including  patients  with  renal  and  hepatic  impairment  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP given the overall benign safety profile of idebenone and the rarity of 
the target disease. Nevertheless, in the product information, caution was advised in treatment of patients 
with hepatic or renal impairment. In addition, use in pregnancy and lactation, patients under 14 years of 
age, the elderly, and patients with hepatic and renal impairment were reflected as missing information in 
the RMP.  
Overall, the incidence of AEs and treatment related AEs were low and similar between idebenone and 
placebo  groups.  The  most  common  AEs  in  the  idebenone  treatment  group  were  headache, 
nasopharyngitis, diarrhea and nausea. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity.  
With respect to the RHODOS study, headache (23.6%), nasopharyngitis (25.5%), dizziness (5.5%) and 
cough (10.9%)  were  more  frequent  in  the  idebenone group  than  the  placebo  group.  In  addition,  five 
subjects (four treated with idebenone and one treated with placebo) experienced treatment-related AEs: 
blood triglycerides increased (reported for one subject in each group); left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and liver function tests abnormal.  
The total reporting incidence of LVH was 7.3% (4 patients) in the idebenone group versus 0.0% in the 
placebo group, although only one case was considered related to the treatment by the investigator. All 
events  were  non-serious  and were  reported  by  the  same  investigational  site on  the  basis  of  the  ECG 
readings. The diagnosis was not supported by clinical or ultrasound evidence. A further review of all the 
ECG reports showed that the cardiologist at this site reported findings suggestive of LVH in 16 additional 
cases. Most of them were detected pre-treatment at Baseline. The incidence of ECG findings suggestive of 
LVH developing after initiation of the study treatment was lower in the idebenone group (7.27%) than in 
the placebo group (13.33%). Comparison of a single baseline ECG to a single ECG at 6 months is not a 
robust  determination  of  cardiac  safety  and  caution  should  be  used  in  interpreting  these  data.  Taking 
together  all  available  data  in  350  patients  with  FRDA  and  in  85 patients  with  LHON,  there  was  no 
demonstrated signal of any ECG abnormality in heart rate, AV conduction as measured by the PR interval, 
depolarization  as  measured  by  the  QRS  interval  nor  in  cardiac  repolarization  as  defined  by  the  QTcF 
duration attributable to idebenone. Hence, the CHMP concluded that there was no firm evidence of cardiac 
disorders associated with idebenone use. 
Blood triglycerides increased was reported for one subject in each treatment group, whereby the patient 
in the placebo arm also reported the treatment-related AE alanine aminotransferase increased.  
Concerning the treatment related AE of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the patient already had an ECG 
abnormality at screening, reported as incomplete left bundle block. This finding was further elaborated by 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 76/89 
 
 
  
 
 
an independent ECG reading and medical evaluation performed by a contract research organisation, 
which classified a ventricular conduction defect of the ventricular pre-excitation pattern 
(Wolff-Parkinson-White type) both for the pre-treatment as well as for the on-treatment ECG. General 
ECG abnormalities, including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, are not uncommon in LHON patients as 
reported in the literature (Bower et al., 1992; Nikoskelainen et al., 1994; Finsterer et al., 2001; Sorajja 
et al., 2003). For these reasons, the CHMP considered that the reported treatment related AE was likely 
unrelated to idebenone use.  
Treatment-related  AE  reported  by  ≥10.0%  of  subjects  in  the  FRDA  studies  (NICOSIA,  IONIA  and 
MICONOS) were headache and nausea. Other treatment-related AEs reported by ≥ 10.0% of subjects in 
individual FRDA studies included diarrhoea and dyspepsia (10.8%) in NICOSIA, abdominal pain upper 
(13.0%) and fatigue (10.9%) in IONIA, and diarrhoea (12.7%) in MICONOS. Diarrhea and vomiting were 
reported as treatment-related AEs at a higher incidence in the subjects receiving idebenone compared to 
subjects receiving placebo in the FRDA studies. Furthermore, in the MICONOS study treatment-related 
back  pain  was  more  frequently  reported  by  subjects  on  idebenone  (4.6%)  than  on  placebo,  and  the 
incidence  increased  with  idebenone  dose.  There  was  also  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  reports  of 
bronchitis (5.7%) in the idebenone groups in MICONOS compared to placebo. In another FRDA study 
(IONIA)  an  increased  incidence  of  pain  in  extremity  (13%)  was  observed  in  the  idebenone  groups 
compared to the placebo group including one severe case reported as a SAE. Diarrhea is a known adverse 
drug reaction of idebenone and was included in SmPC section 4.8. Furthermore, based on the above data, 
the CHMP was of the view that a causal relationship to idebenone use could not be excluded for the AEs 
of vomiting, nausea, dyspepsia, back pain, pain in extremity and bronchitis. 
No deaths occurred in the RHODOS study and during the clinical program for FRDA. One patient died of 
myocardial infarction during the MICONOS-extension study. The causal relationship between this event 
and the study drug was regarded as unrelated and to be attributed to the patient's underlying disease. 
Chromaturia and blood dyscrasia were reported as laboratory abnormalities in FRDA studies. Although 
these laboratory findings were not observed in patients with LHON, the CHMP considered that a warning 
statement should be included in the product information to inform healthcare professionals and patients 
that the metabolites of idebenone are coloured and may cause discoloration of the urine. With regards to 
haematological changes, the Applicant submitted a detailed analysis which indicated that the AEs related 
to  blood  count  abnormalities  were  unlikely  related  to  idebenone  and  rather  related  to  multiple 
confounding factors present in the study population (i.e., FRDA but not LHON patients). Nevertheless, an 
uncertainty remained and blood count abnormalities were included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP. 
Data from RHODOS indicated that 3 subjects had increased liver enzymes within the study and one of the 
patients discontinued the study because of this AE. However, on closer examination all 3 subjects had 
values higher than normal already at Baseline. Data from FRDA subjects showed very few categorical 
changes for liver enzyme levels from <3xULN to >3xULN or >5xULN and no clinically significant change 
in liver function tests was observed with idebenone treatment. However, a report of fulminant hepatitis 
and another report of cytolytic hepatitis were received in the context of post marketing monitoring. Both 
reports were inconclusive since the subject with fulminant hepatitis had multiple concomitant medications 
which were known to be potentially hepatotoxic agents thus representing important confounding factors, 
while for the case of cytolytic hepatitis a coherent causal assessment could not be made due to the lack 
of information. Taken together, the available data did not present firm evidence for a causal relationship 
of liver enzyme increases and hepatitis with idebenone use, however, at the same time a causality could 
not be excluded without doubt, also considering that the product information of the reference product 
Mnesis lists these events as ADRs. Therefore, abnormal liver function and hepatitis was included as an 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 77/89 
 
 
  
 
 
important potential risk in the RMP. Furthermore, the CHMP and the PRAC were of the view that additional 
data should be collected in a post-marketing study to further elucidate this potential risk. 
No interaction studies in humans have been performed. Given the results from in vitro inhibition data, 
presystemic inhibition of CYP3A4 by idebenone could not be excluded. Therefore, the CHMP requested 
that  the  Applicant  should  perform  an  in  vivo  post-authorisation  study  to  assess  the  potential  PK 
interaction of idebenone with midazolam in healthy male volunteers, as discussed in detail in section 2.4.  
Spontaneous abortion seemed to be higher than expected with 4 out of 8 cases of drug exposure during 
pregnancy including reports from post-marketing monitoring resulting in spontaneous abortion. All cases 
reported  were  for  patients  with  FRDA  and  some  cases  were  confounded  by  the  use  of  concomitant 
medications. Taken together and including observations in the literature, the CHMP was of the view that 
there was insufficient evidence to conclude on a causal relationship with idebenone. 
AEs observed in the EAP were in accordance with AEs observed in the RHODOS and FRDA studies. Only 
very limited information could be derived from RHODOS OFU. No new safety concern arose from these 
data. 
Finally, the CHMP noted that in principle the SmPC content for a hybrid product should be consistent with 
the reference medicinal product. Mnesis, the reference product of Raxone, is administered at doses of 90 
mg/day idebenone, which is 10 times less than the recommended daily dose for Raxone. Therefore, the 
CHMP considered that ADRs listed for Mnesis should also be reflected in SmPC section 4.8 of Raxone. The 
following ADRs are listed for Mnesis: 
•  Hypersensitivity reactions: rash, pruritus  
• 
Psychoneurological  reactions:  convulsions,  delirium,  hallucinations,  excitation,  involuntary 
movements,  hyperkinesia,  poriomania,  dizziness,  headache,  restlessness,  light-headedness, 
torpor. 
•  Gastro-intestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomach ache, diarrhoea. 
•  Blood disorders: agranulocytosis, anaemia, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia 
•  Hepatic  disorders:  increased  aspartate  aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  alkaline 
phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase or bilirubin. 
•  Kidney disorders: increased azotaemia 
•  Metabolic disorders: increased total cholesterol or triglycerides 
•  General: Malaise 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been  included  in  the  product  information.  Hypersensitivity  to  the  active  substance  or  to  any  of  the 
excipients was included as a contraindication in line with the SmPC guideline. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on the 
clinical safety of Raxone under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive, nor was 
it considered feasible to generate a comprehensive data set mainly due to the rarity of LHON’s disease. 
Furthermore, at the time of this report, idebenone was already used to treat LHON patients in clinical 
practice,  thus  preventing  the  generation  of  placebo-controlled  data  to  confirm  the  safety  profile  as 
established based on the available data at the time of this report.  
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 78/89 
 
 
  
 
 
Following an oral explanation by the Applicant, the CHMP agreed that it was not feasible to produce a 
comprehensive data set under normal conditions of use of Raxone. The CHMP was furthermore of the view 
that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances should be granted subject to a number of 
specific  obligations  in  line  with  a  program  of  studies proposed  by  the  Applicant.  Within  this  program, 
additional safety data should be collected through a Product Exposure Registry. Data from this registry 
should be generated on a regular basis based on an agreed protocol and should also aim at addressing the 
safety concerns as specified in the RMP. In addition, while mainly intended for the generation of further 
efficacy data, additional safety information should also be generated from an open label interventional 
study in LHON patients treated with idebenone as well as from follow-up data from the ongoing EAP (see 
section 2.5.5. ). The specific obligations will be reviewed annually and continuation of the authorisation 
shall be linked to these annual re-assessments. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the available safety data, including clinical data from LHON patients as 
well as supportive data from the FRDA clinical program and post-marketing experience, supported the 
Application for Raxone in the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with LHON’s 
disease. The safety profile was considered rather benign with only few reports of serious AEs and the 
majority of AEs being mild or moderate in intensity. Relevant safety data have been adequately reflected 
in the product information as well as the RMP.  
With regards to the submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs), the CHMP considered that the 
first PSUR for Raxone should be submitted within 12 months following authorisation in the EU. Thereafter, 
the requirements of the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) apply. 
Nevertheless, the available safety data in the target population were limited and considered by the CHMP 
to be incomprehensive. The CHMP therefore considered the following measures necessary to generate 
additional safety data in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances: 
•  Non-interventional PASS: In order to further investigate the safety of Raxone in the treatment of 
LHON patients, the MAH should generate data based on an agreed protocol from a drug exposure 
registry of patients prescribed Raxone for the treatment of LHON in clinical practice. The registry 
should also be used to generate data on long-term effectiveness. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
2.8.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 was acceptable providing minor 
revisions were made to the RMP. The applicant addressed these minor revisions and submitted an update 
RMP version 1.3.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.3 with the following content:

2.9.  Product information 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Raxone (idebenone) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is approved under exceptional circumstances.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant showed that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Beneficial effects 
LHON patients suffer from sudden, rapid and severe bilateral vision loss, which is irreversible in most 
patients following degeneration of the optic nerve in the late, chronic stage of the disease. Effective 
treatments should aim at preventing or reversing loss of vision. At the time of this report, there was no 
approved treatment available. 
The benefits of Raxone in the treatment of LHON’s disease have been investigated in the double-blind, 
placebo controlled RHODOS trial in which patients were treated with 900mg idebenone  (2x150mg t.i.d.) 
or placebo over a period of 6 months. Further supportive data was available from an Expanded Access 
Programme (EAP), a Natural History Case Record Survey (CRS) and the scientific literature.  
Overall,  and  across  all  available  data  sets,  there  was  a  consistent  pattern  of  visual  improvements  in 
favour of Raxone. In RHODOS, there was a numerical advantage of Raxone over placebo throughout the 
different visual acuity (VA) endpoints. For the key secondary endpoint (change in Best VA at Week 24 
compared  to  Baseline),  patients  in  the  placebo  group  worsened  by  4 letters  on  a  vision  chart,  while 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 82/89 
 
 
  
 
 
patients  on  idebenone  showed  a  slight  improvement  by  1  letter.  The  between-group  difference  was 
increased from 5 to 8 letters when analyses were performed on the mITT population (ITT p=0.078 and 
mITT p=0.015). A beneficial effect in favour of Raxone was also observed for patients with off-chart vision 
at Baseline, who improved to on-chart vision, being able to read at least 1 line on a vision chart, by the 
end of the study (7 out of 25 patients in the idebenone group versus 0 out of 13 patients in the placebo 
group).  This  change  from  off-chart  to  on-chart  vision  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  clinically 
meaningful  since  it  represents  an  important  categorical  change.  Finally,  amongst  the  post-hoc  VA 
analyses, the CHMP considered the responder analysis of clinically relevant recovery (CRR) as defined by 
Carelli et  al.  (2011) to be  a  valuable  marker  for  assessing  treatment  benefits.  A  higher  proportion of 
patients in the Raxone group (16/53 patients, 30.2%) than in the placebo group (ITT: 3/29 patients, 
10.3%,  mITT:  2/28  patients,  7.1%)  had  CRR  in  at  least  one  eye.  The  between-group  difference  was 
statistically significant when analyses were conducted on the mITT population (p=0.0234).  
In  order  to  compare  the  data  from  RHODOS,  the  EAP  and  the  CRS,  additional  CRR  analyses  were 
conducted. Throughout these analyses there was generally a larger proportion of responders treated with 
idebenone  compared  to  untreated  or  placebo-treated  patients.  After  6  months,  19  out  of  62  patients 
(30.6%) in the EAP had CRR and 18 out of 94 patients (19.1%) in the CRS had spontaneous CRR, which 
was  within  the  range  of  the  results  observed  in  RHODOS,  thus  providing  independent  support  of  the 
RHODOS  findings.  Also,  the  CRS  represented  a  rather  unique  dataset  contributing  to  a  better 
understanding of the natural course of LHON’s disease. 
To some degree, results on VA endpoint in RHODOS were also supported by favourable trends in non-VA 
endpoints, including improvements of colour contrast sensitivity and preservation of the retinal nerve 
fibre layer in patients with more recent disease onset, although the sample sizes for these analyses were 
small. 
Finally, while some subgroup analyses in RHODOS suggested a larger effect size of Raxone in patients 
with disease onset of less than one year, responder analyses in the EAP showed that, in absolute terms, 
the  outcome  VA  for  early  versus  late-treated  eyes  was  similar.  Therefore,  and  since  the  current 
knowledge  of  the  course  of  the  disease  suggests  that  recovery  of  vision  is  possible  even  years  after 
symptom onset, the CHMP considered that the indication should be kept broad and not be restricted to 
early  treatment,  as  initially  proposed  by  the  Applicant.  Likewise,  only  few  data  were  available  for 
paediatric patients treated with Raxone, in particular for patients below the age of 14 (6 patients in the 
EAP).  Nevertheless,  taking  into  account  the  rarity  of  the  disease  and  the  amount  of  data  that  can 
reasonably be expected to be generated in this age group, the CHMP was of the view that the available 
data justified an indication in adolescents. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The analysis of RHODOS data was complicated by the small number of study participants and, at the same 
time, the heterogeneity of the patients enrolled, being at different stages in their disease progression. To 
a  degree,  these  factors  might  explain  the  failure  of  the  RHODOS  study  to  demonstrate  superiority  of 
Raxone  over  placebo  in  the  primary  as  well  as  the  majority  of  secondary  endpoints  at  a  statistical 
significance level of 5%. While numerical trends in favour of Raxone were observed, it was difficult to 
derive firm conclusions from RHODOS alone.  
Uncertainties in the robustness of the RHODOS data also arose from the effect of the exclusion of one 
patient from the placebo group, considered by the Applicant to be a natural history confounder, which 
resulted in a considerable increase of the between-group differences. In addition, given the potential of 
spontaneous recovery in LHON’s disease, there was a risk of over-estimating the effect of idebenone. 
Furthermore, many of the subgroup and responder analyses conducted in RHODOS were either based on 
small sample sizes or lacked pre-specification. Finally, any potential improvement in vision in patients 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 83/89 
 
 
  
 
 
treated with Raxone did not appear to be translated into benefits for the patient’s daily activities and 
health-related  quality  of  life,  although  this  might  be  explained  by  a  lack  of  sensitivity  of  the  HRQoL 
questionnaire. 
For the present Application, independent evidence for efficacy of Raxone was provided from the EAP and 
the CRS. Comparison to RHODOS was however hampered by the lack of continuous VA measurements as 
well as the heterogeneous study population. This concern was addressed by the conduct of additional 
responder analyses abandoning the concept of nadir and differentiating between off-chart and on-chart 
vision as well as study duration. The analyses across data sets generally supported a beneficial effect of 
Raxone. In the interpretation of the results it has to be kept in mind that response rates following different 
response definitions are highly correlated by nature.  
During  the  assessment,  questions  were  also  raised  about  the  impact  of  possible  confounding  factors, 
including  possible  prognostic  criteria  for  spontaneous  recovery,  such  as  time  since  disease  onset, 
mutation status, age and smoking. However, univariate analysis only showed that the T14484C mutation 
was associated with a higher proportion of CRR responders, which was expected due to the more benign 
course of the disease in patients with this mutation.  
With regards to maintenance of the treatment effects, the results of a single follow-up visit of patients 
previously  treated  in  RHODOS  suggested  that  the  benefits  obtained  from  Raxone  treatment  over  6 
months  persisted  even  after  treatment  discontinuation.  However,  hardly  any  new  information  for 
idebenone  treatment  duration  could  be  derived  from  these  data.  Remarkably,  when  considering  the 
evidence across data sets, there was a higher proportion of patients/eyes with CRR amongst untreated 
patients after 36 months, compared to treated patients after 6 months. Thus, and despite the availability 
of  data  from  45  patients  in  the  EAP  who  were  treated  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time  (more  than  12 
months), uncertainties remained with regards to the benefits of idebenone treatment beyond 6 months. 
Consequently, the CHMP recommended that the Applicant should gather long-term data post-marketing.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse drug reactions were nasopharyngitis, cough, diarrhoea and back pain. 
No serious adverse events have been reported as related to idebenone exposure. Overall, the incidence 
of adverse events and treatment related adverse events in clinical trials were low and similar between 
idebenone  and  placebo  groups.  The  majority  of  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity. 
Furthermore, discontinuations from study drug due to adverse events were generally low. One patient 
discontinued the RHODOS study because of an abnormal liver function test.  
No potential safety signal emerged from the review of vital signs and laboratory data. Chromaturia was 
reported  as  laboratory  abnormalities  in clinical  trials  in  Friedreich’s  ataxia,  which  provided  supportive 
evidence for the safety of idebenone at doses recommended for use in LHON. Although these laboratory 
findings were not observed in LHON patients, a warning was included in the product information to inform 
healthcare professionals and patients that the metabolites of idebenone are coloured which may lead to 
discoloration of the urine. 
Overall, idebenone at therapeutic doses was well-tolerated and adverse events were generally 
manageable. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Limited  safety  data  were  available  for  the  target  population  and  for  long-term  use  of  Raxone. 
Furthermore,  no  specific  studies  have  been  conducted  in  special  populations,  e.g.  renal  impairment, 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 84/89 
 
 
  
 
 
elderly,  pregnancy  and  lactation.  However,  data  from  the  clinical  trials  program  in  Friedreich’s  ataxia 
provided supportive information for the safety profile of idebenone. The CHMP was furthermore of the 
view that the lack of studies in special populations could be accepted due to the generally benign safety 
profile of Raxone. There was also some post-marketing experience albeit in different populations and at 
different doses. 
Left  ventricular  hypertrophy  was  reported  as  treatment  related  in  one  patient  receiving  idebenone  in 
RHODOS,  but  the  diagnosis  was  not  considered  very  robust  as  it  was  based  on  ECG  readings  alone. 
Furthermore,  one  patient  in  the  idebenone  arm  of  RHODOS  was  reported  with  treatment-related 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, but further investigations revealed that a ventricular conduction defect 
was already present prior to treatment. Taking together the totality of the available safety data including 
the  result  from  non-clinical  tests,  there  was  no  evidence  for  an  association  of  cardiac  disorders  with 
idebenone use.  
Events of blood dyscrasias have been reported in studies in Friedreich’s ataxia. Although these events 
were  most  likely  related  to  multiple  confounding  factors  present  in  that  particular  population,  an 
uncertainty remained and blood count abnormalities were included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP. 
Three patients in RHODOS had increased liver enzymes and one of the patients discontinued the study 
because  of  this  event.  However,  on  closer  examination  all  3  subjects  had  values  higher  than  normal 
already at Baseline. Additional post-marketing reports of hepatitis were inconclusive. Taken together, the 
available data did not present firm evidence for a causal relationship of liver toxicity with idebenone use. 
However, as an association could not be excluded without doubt, abnormal liver function and hepatitis 
was  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP  and  additional  data  should  be  collected 
post-marketing. 
Finally,  no  interaction  studies  in  humans  have  been  performed  and  given  the  results  from  in  vitro 
inhibition  data,  pre-systemic  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  by  idebenone  could  not  be  excluded.  Therefore,  a 
post-authorisation study to assess potential PK interaction of idebenone with midazolam was included as 
a requirement in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
At the time of this report, there was no approved treatment available for LHON’s disease. Thus, there was 
an unmet medical need for therapies able to prevent or reverse vision loss.  
Taking into account the totality of the available data, there was a consistent trend towards a beneficial 
effect of Raxone in the treatment of vision impairment in LHON patients across data sets. Compared to 
placebo, patients receiving Raxone treatment over 6 months could read 5-8 letters more (best VA), which 
represents ≥1 line on a vision chart. Clinically relevant recoveries of vision were observed more 
frequently in patients treated with Raxone (30%) than in patients receiving placebo (7-10%) or no 
treatment (19%), suggesting that some patients may derive non-negligible benefits from Raxone.  
At the same time, the safety profile of Raxone can be considered benign. Adverse events observed during 
treatment were generally mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse reactions were manageable and 
unlikely to require treatment discontinuation. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considered that the observed consistent pattern of visual improvements under Raxone 
treatment translated into a clinically relevant benefit in the treatment of LHON’s disease. Independent 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)  
Page 85/89 
 
 
  
 
 
evidence from the EAP and CRS provided reassurance that the trends observed in RHODOS in favour of 
Raxone were no chance findings. Therefore, and in light of the benign safety profile, the CHMP considered 
that the benefits of Raxone in the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with 
Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy outweighed its risks. The CHMP therefore concluded that the 
benefit-risk balance was positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
This Application concerned a hybrid version of idebenone, film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Mnesis is indicated for the treatment of cognitive and behavioural deficits due to cerebral pathologies of 
vascular or degenerative origin.  
LHON is a maternally inherited disease resulting in a defect of the mitochondrial function which in turn 
causes inactivation and subsequent degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Idebenone, being a 
derivative of co-enzyme Q10, has been tested in the treatment of various mitochondrial respiratory chain 
disorders due to its antioxidative and electron carrier properties. A plausible biological explanation for a 
treatment effect in LHON could be restoration of mitochondrial function during the time window when 
RGCs are inactive but still viable, thus allowing recovery of vision or prevention of disease progression. 
Studies in LHON’s disease are challenging due to the rarity of the disease and slow recruitment of patients 
as well as the occurrence of spontaneous recoveries in a heterogeneous population. The pivotal trial 
supporting this Application, RHODOS, failed to show superiority of Raxone over placebo at a statistical 
significance level of 5% and there were concerns questioning the robustness of the trial’s data in general. 
These concerns were alleviated by additional adequately designed analyses including independent 
evidence from the EAP and natural history CSR, confirming the trends observed in RHODOS towards a 
favourable effect of idebenone treatment. This was further substantiated by the Applicant in an oral 
explanation. Altogether, the totality of the evidence allowed the CHMP to conclude that LHON patients 
may gain clinically relevant benefits from Raxone treatment.   
Due to limitations of the available data at the time of this report, the CHMP requested additional data on 
the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with Raxone as well as to investigate pre-systemic PK 
interactions post-marketing. Data collection post-authorisation should also be used to further elucidate a 
potential unconfirmed risk of liver enzyme increases and hepatotoxicity. As only few patients had been 
exposed to Raxone for more than 6 months, no recommendations could be given on the treatment 
duration, and post-marketing data should aim at addressing this issue.  
The CHMP furthermore considered that the safety and efficacy in patients 12 years of age and younger 
had not been established and therefore approval was limited to adults and adolescents. Treatment should 
be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in LHON. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account all available data, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Raxone in the 
treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with LHON was positive. However, the 
CHMP was of the view that the data set on the clinical efficacy and safety of Raxone could not be 
considered comprehensive. In an oral explanation, the Applicant convincingly demonstrated that, due to 
the rarity of LHON’s disease and since idebenone was already used to treat LHON patients in clinical 
practice, it was not feasible to recruit sufficient patients within a reasonable timeframe into a 
placebo-controlled trial, thus preventing the generation of additional controlled data to confirm the 
outcomes observed in RHODOS, the EAP and the CRS. However, the Applicant proposed a program of 
both interventional and non-interventional studies to generate additional data post-marketing. 
Assessment Report (EMA/480039/2015)

The CHMP agreed that it was not feasible to produce a comprehensive data under normal conditions of use 
of Raxone due to the rarity of the indication. The CHMP was furthermore of the view that a marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances should be granted subject to a number of specific 
obligations: 
• 
In order to further investigate the benefits of Raxone in the treatment of LHON patients, the MAH 
should conduct and submit the results of an external natural history controlled, open-label 
intervention study to assess the efficacy and safety of Raxone in the treatment of LHON patients, 
including long-term treatment.  
A draft protocol was reviewed by the CHMP during the course of this Application. Both 
patients/eyes with newly diagnosed disease (≤1 year), but also to those presenting >1 and up to 
5 years since onset of symptoms should be recruited. Patients should receive Raxone treatment 
up to 24 months. The planned number of patients to be recruited (n=250, 125 each for disease 
onset ≤ and > 1 year prior to study star) was considered large enough. Patients form the 
open-label study should be matched to historic controls based on pre-specified criteria. Any 
substantial change(s) to the protocol should be agreed with the CHMP in advance. Furthermore, 
a summary of all protocol amendments should be presented with the annual re-assessments. 
Finally, while mainly intended for the generation of efficacy data, additional safety information 
should also be generated from this study. The final study report should be provided by 31 August 
2020. 
• 
In order to further investigate the benefits of Raxone in the treatment of LHON patients, the MAH 
should maintain and extend the Historical Case Record Survey of Visual Acuity Data from Patients 
with LHON to serve as the external control to the open label study.  
The protocol was reviewed by the CHMP during the course of this Application. Any substantial 
change(s) to the protocol should be agreed with the CHMP in advance. Furthermore, a summary 
of all protocol amendments should be presented with the annual re-assessments. 
The final report should be provided by 31 August 2020. 
•  Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS): In order to further investigate the 
safety of Raxone in the treatment of LHON patients, the MAH should generate data based on an 
agreed protocol from a drug exposure registry of patients prescribed Raxone for the treatment of 
LHON in clinical practice. The registry should also be used to generate data on long-term 
effectiveness. 
While mainly intended for the generation of further safety data, data on long-term effectiveness 
and lack or loss of therapeutic response should also be generated from the drug exposure 
registry. Data from this registry should furthermore aim at addressing safety concerns including 
hepatotoxicity as specified in the RMP. 
• 
The MAH should follow up patients in the existing Expanded Access Programme and submit the 
final results.  
Follow-up was planned until no longer required for named-patient access, which was estimated at 
3 years. While mainly intended for the generation of further efficacy data, additional safety 
information should also be generated. The final study report should be provided by 31 August 
2019. 
Data from these studies should be generated on a regular basis for review in the context of the annual 
re-assessments.

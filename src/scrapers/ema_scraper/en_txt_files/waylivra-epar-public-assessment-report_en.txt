2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Waylivra is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adult patients with genetically 
confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom 
response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by 
extremely high serum triglycerides (TG) (> 750 mg/dL, 8.5 mmol/L), which are carried primarily in 
chylomicrons (dietary lipids) (Brahm and Hegele 2015), and affects an estimated 3000-5000 patients 
globally. Chylomicrons are large (~ 1 micron in diameter) lipoprotein particles that, if elevated, can 
result in several clinical manifestations.  
Chylomicronemia causes reduced blood flow in the microcirculation and has been identified to affect 
several organ systems including the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, and the 
gastrointestinal system, resulting in cognitive impairment, muscle and joint pain, and abdominal pain, 
respectively. The most serious effects are on the pancreatic microcirculation leading to severe 
abdominal pain and pancreatitis (Valdivielso et al. 2014). 
The inflammatory changes caused by excessive chylomicronemia induce acute pancreatitis, which can 
be fatal or lead to pancreatic damage, resulting in permanent exocrine or endocrine insufficiency 
(Symersky et al. 2006). 
2.1.2.  Biologic features 
The mechanism of this disease includes functional deficiency of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an essential 
enzyme in hydrolysis of plasma TGs, a prerequisite for effective chylomicron clearance. Patients with 
FCS have inherited recessive defects that limit or impair functionality of LPL, resulting in 
chylomicronemia. These include mutations in the LPL gene encoding for LPL, or mutations in genes 
that code for other proteins necessary for proper LPL function, including APOC2, LMF1, APOA5 and 
GPIHBP1 (Brahm and Hegele 2015, Ahmad et al. 2017, Stroes et al. 2017). FCS patients who do not 
have one of the aforementioned identified genetic mutations continue to be identified through clinical 
presentation. With further research on such patients, it is likely that new genetic mutations impairing 
LPL function will be identified. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Patients with FCS have a number of severe and potentially life-threatening complications associated 
with the disease. Complications associated with the disease are believed to result from TG levels being 
above a critical threshold; > 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is a well-established threshold for increased 
pancreatitis risk and > 750 mg/dL is widely thought to represent a threshold above which there is 
chylomicron accumulation which increases pancreatitis risk. In addition, patients with FCS frequently 
experience other manifestations that have impact on their daily lives including cognitive, emotional 
(i.e., psychosocial), and physical impairments that include abdominal pain, steatorrhea, bloating, 
asthenia, fatigue, anxiety and depression, fear and worry, “brain fog”, lack of concentration, and 
impairment of memory, all occurring frequently and moderate to very severe in magnitude. All these 
complications diminish quality of life, impact on employment choices, ability to secure and maintain 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 8/121 
 
 
 
 
 
employment, and days lost from work due to FCS. Most frequently reported symptoms across these 
domains include abdominal pain, steatorrhea, bloating, asthenia, and fatigue. 
Acute pancreatitis presents the most significant risk in patients with FCS, with potential mortality and 
other significant complications (Davidson 2017). Approximately 65-80% of patients with FCS will 
experience at least one episode of acute pancreatitis, with the majority experiencing recurrent 
episodes (Gaudet et al. 2016). Long-term complications as a result of acute pancreatitis may include 
chronic pancreatitis, pancreatogenic (Type 3c) diabetes and endocrine and exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiencies, with their attendant complications and hepatosplenomegaly (Symersky et al. 2006).  
2.1.4.  Management 
Patients with FCS are on strict dietary fat restriction. Traditional lipid-lowering medications used to 
treat hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), such as fibrates, statins and fish oils, niacin (not registered any more 
in EU) and off label lomitapide are minimally effective in patients with FCS because their effectiveness 
depends, at least in part, on a functional LPL enzyme, notably deficient in a large proportion of these 
individuals (Brahm and Hegele 2015, Stroes et al. 2017). The previously approved gene therapy 
(Glybera) was restricted to those FCS patients with LPL deficiency, suffering from severe or multiple 
pancreatitis attacks and detectable levels of LPL protein with a genetic confirmed testing. However, 
this product has been withdrawn from use in the European Union since October 2017 following the 
marketing authorisation holder’s decision not to apply for a renewal for commercial reasons. 
About the product 
Volanesorsen (also known as volanesorsen sodium, ISIS 304801, ISIS-ApoCIIIRx) is a 2′-O-2-
methoxyethyl (2′-MOE) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibitor of the molecular target apoC-III, a 
key regulator of TG metabolism. 
Antisense technology interrupts the protein production process by degrading the target messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and thus reducing the translation of the specific protein. Antisense inhibitors 
are designed to be sequence specific with a high binding affinity to their unique target mRNA. 
Volanesorsen is designed to bind to a specific segment within the 3′-untranslated region of the human 
apoC-III mRNA and promote a reduction in apoC-III protein.  
FCS is primarily a consequence of impaired triglyceride rich lipoprotein (TRL) clearance, manifested by 
the severe elevation in plasma TG and TG-rich lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoproteins 
(VLDL) and/or chylomicrons. Levels of the apoC-III protein, which reside on the surface of apoB 
containing lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins, are elevated in patients with FCS and the 
majority of apoC-III is associated with TG-rich lipoproteins (TLRs) in these patients. Volanesorsen 
therapy causes suppression of the ApoC-III protein, which leads to reductions in plasma TG in FCS 
patients. 
The claimed indication for Waylivra was as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).  
The indication approved by the CHMP was as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically 
confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom 
response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. 
The recommended dose regimen of Waylivra is a starting dose of 285 mg once weekly for 3 months. 
Following 3 months, dose frequency should be reduced to 285 mg every 2 weeks.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant sought advice on the clinical development of this product from the CHMP, regarding the 
patient population definition to be included in the pivotal study, and the selection of appropriate 
endpoints in support of the claimed indication. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 285 mg of volanesorsen (as 
volanesorsen sodium) as active substance in 1.5 ml solution.  
Other ingredients are: sodium hydroxide and hydrocloric acid. 
The product is available as a single-dose, type I glass pre-filled syringe with a siliconised chlorobutyl 
rubber stopper and staked needle with shield, filled to deliver 1.5 mL of solution, as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.1.  Active substance 
General information 
The active substance, volanesorsen sodium, is a single stranded synthetic oligonucleotide with an 
antisense mechanism of action.  
The chemical name of volanesorsen is  
DNA, d(P-thio)([2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]rA-[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]rG-[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]m5rC-
[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]m5rU-[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]m5rU-m5C-T-T-G-Tm5C-m5C-A-G-m5C-[2'-O-
(2-methoxyethyl)]m5rU-[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]m5rU-[2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]m5rU corresponding to 
the molecular formula C230H301N63O125P19S19Na19.  
The sodium salt has a relative molecular mass of 7582.7 Da g/mol and the following structure (see 
Figure 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 10/121 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Structure of volanesorsen 
The sequence is: 5’AGMeCMeUMeUMeCTTGTMeCMeCAGMeCMeUMeUMeUAMeU-3′. The underlined 
residues are 2’-O-(2 methoxyethyl) nucleosides, all other residues are 2′deoxynucleosides. 
Volanesorsen is the nonadecasodium salt of a 20-base residue (20-mer) phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotide. Each of the 19 internucleotide linkages is a 3’-O to 5’-O phosphorothioate diester. The 
five sugar residues on the 3ʹ and 5ʹ ends are 2-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-D-ribose (MOE). The 10 sugar 
residues in the middle are 2-deoxy-D-ribose. All of the cytosine bases are methylated at the 5-
position. 
The absolute configuration of each 2-deoxy-D-ribose unit is (1R, 3S, 4R). The absolute configuration of 
each 2-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-D-ribose unit is (1R, 2R, 3R, 4R). The absolute configuration at each 
phosphorous atom is undefined and hence volanesorsen is a mixture of 219 diastereoisomers 
(524,288), where no individual diastereoisomer contributes to approximately 0.0018% of the total.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for volanesorsen. The active substance is a hygroscopic white to 
yellow solid, amorphous phosphorothioate oligonucleotide isolated in the sodium salt form, freely 
soluble in water and in aqueous sodium acetate buffer pH 3. 
The general information provided for volanesorsen is acceptable. 
The chemical structure of volanesorsen was elucidated by a combination of chemical and spectral 
analysis proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, carbon nuclear magnetic 
resonance (13C NMR) spectroscopy, phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy, 
high resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF). Failure sequence 
analysis data, obtained on crude volanesorsen due to incomplete coupling in each synthesis cycle, 
using ion-pair high performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IP-HPLC-
TOF-MS) confirmed volanesorsen has the claimed nucleotide sequence. The sequence is also assured 
via the automated chemical synthesis and associated process controls. The elemental analysis results 
are consistent with the molecular formula of volanesorsen. The measured masses and the theoretical 
masses for the fragments are in compliance. The characterisation data provide adequate evidence for 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 11/121 
 
 
 
 
 
the primary structure of the active substance, with suitable assurance that this can be routinely 
monitored during commercial synthesis. 
The following physicochemical characterisation tests are consistent with the expected properties: ultra 
violet (UV) spectrophotometry, hygroscopicity, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA), and pH of solution. 
Carbon stereochemistry is defined and controlled by the use of chirally pure starting materials, and is 
not impacted by the manufacturing process of volanesorsen. The stereoselectivity experiments 
performed indicate that the ratio of absolute configurations at each internucleotide linkage varies 
within the sequence, but the ratios are reproducible, which implies that also the diastereomeric 
composition is reproducible and robust towards variations in synthesis conditions. The sequence of 
oligonucleotides and the mixture of activators, 4,5-dicyanoimidazole and N-methylimidazole, used 
during the synthesis of volanesorsen are fixed; therefore, the diastereoisomeric composition of 
volanesorsen is not expected to vary. The thermal melt temperature (Tm) test measures hybridisation 
temperature and is unique to oligonucleotides. Tm, coupled with UV spectroscopy, measures the affinity 
of an oligonucleotide to its complementary strand. It provides supportive evidence of the correct 
sequence and can serve as a useful control for the consistent structure of the molecule. Tm results 
from ten volanesorsen batches are provided and the results are consistent.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
One manufacturer, Ionis Pharmaceutical Inc, USA, is responsible for the manufacture of the active 
substance. Volanesorsen is synthesised using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The nucleoside phosphoramidites are the defined as starting materials and are 
adequately controlled.  
There are no alternate processes or reprocessing steps in the commercial manufacture of 
volanesorsen. A typical batch of volanesorsen is defined as the quantity produced in a single freeze 
drying run. There are no defined in-process controls during the synthesis of the drug substance.  In 
view of tight control of the intermediates of the process and the intrinsic in-process control of the 
equipment used for the synthesis and purification steps, this is accepted. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents are 
satisfactory. During the review, the limits for purity of the intermediates of the synthesis have been 
tightened, in line with batch data, and are now considered acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Volanesorsen may contain a number of product-related and 
process impurities. Product-related impurities, i.e., impurities that are oligonucleotides, can be divided 
into three main categories, starting material- and reagent-derived impurities, product-related 
impurities formed due to incomplete or side reactions, and product-related degradation products. 
Starting materials that are not reactive are separated from the support-bound product by solvent wash 
steps and consequently cannot be carried forward into the active substance. In contrast, reactive 
starting material impurities compete for incorporation during the coupling reaction and may lead to 
active substance oligonucleotide impurities that are not removed by subsequent processing steps. The 
latter are considered critical impurities and are, therefore, tightly controlled by starting material 
specifications. Product-related impurities can also be due to incomplete or side reactions that may 
occur during the manufacturing process. Potential product-related impurities, observed long-term and 
in stress studies, have adequately been discussed. Potential genotoxic impurities have been classified 
according ICH M7 and unknown potential mutagenic impurities evaluated adequately. In line with ICH 
M7, it was concluded that control of impurities during synthesis is not required.

The pharmaceutical development included elements of Quality by Design (QbD), in line with ICH Q8, 
Q9, Q10, and Q11 and it draws from the experience and prior knowledge of the manufacturer gained 
from a marketed oligonucleotide product. The CQA identified are identity, assay, purity, impurities, 
starting materials and reagent derived impurities, endotoxin and bioburden, elemental impurities. 
During the manufacturing process development a FMEA risk assessment was performed to identify the 
critical process parameters (CPPs) that impact one or more CQAs of the active substance.  Design of 
experiments (detritylation volumes and delivery times for each synthesis cycle) and several laboratory 
studies (reduced phosphoramidite equivalents, sulfurisation volume and – time, capping volume and – 
time, phosphorus deprotection volume and – time, ammonium hydroxide quantity, ammonolysis 
temperature and -time, purification elution solutions and temperatures, detritylation kinetics (pH, time, 
and temperature) have been conducted on the CPPs. Based on these studies, proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) have been defined for the investigated steps of the manufacturing process of the active 
substance. . The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data 
from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. The commercial manufacturing 
process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical development program. The 
basic manufacturing process and design and operating principles remained the same with the 
exception of scale and optimisation of some parameters. The changes made to the process throughout 
the course of development of volanesorsen resulted in reduction in the levels of some impurities and 
an improvement in overall purity between the first clinical lot and the process qualification (PQ) lots. 
Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
Process qualification has been performed on three full scale production batches and the results indicate 
that the process is consistent and adequately controlled. The critical process parameters were 
consistent and amply within the PARs. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  multi-component  container  closure  system.  The  primary 
container closure system complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (sequencing by 
IP-HPLC-TOF-MS and Tm, most abundant mass by ion-pair high performance liquid chromatography-
ultra violet mass spectrometry (IP-HPLC-UV-MS) and sodium counter-ion inductively coupled plasma-
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)), assay, purity, specified impurities, unspecified impurities, 
total degradation products, total impurities (all by IP-HPLC-UV-MS), residual solvents (gas 
chromatography (GC)), elemental impurities (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-
MS)), water (Karl-Fisher), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.) and microbial examination of nonsterile 
products (Ph.Eur.). 
Justification for the applied tests and limits is presented based on the critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Additional tests are included in the specification to ensure process consistency (appearance, water, 
residual solvents and Tm). Several other tests performed during development (i.e. sodium acetate, 
deamination, and small molecule impurities) are not included in the specification as the results of the 
tests confirm that none of them are CQAs of the active substance. The convention of defining the 
impurities in the specification as groups rather than individual components has been satisfactorily 
justified and it is acknowledged that oligonucleotides are excluded from the scope of the ICH guidance 
on impurities in drug substances (Q3A (R2)).

Volanesorsen active substance stability has been demonstrated at water contents of up to 
approximately 120%. Furthermore, studies conducted with oligonucleotides of similar chemistry to 
volanesorsen indicate that with a specified high water content, water activity values are below that 
required to support microbial growth. Additionally, the product compounding weights are adjusted to 
account for active substance water content measured at the time of compounding; hence, the latter 
does not impact finished product concentration. Based on these justifications, the specification limit for 
water content is considered acceptable. 
A statistical approach has been adopted to take process variability into account in setting specification 
limits and the proposed impurity limits are supported by toxicology data. That approach is acceptable. 
The applicant is recommended to reassess the active substance specifications following the synthesis 
of additional batches. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and deamindation impurity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (10 commercial scale batches, including the three qualification batches, 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturer) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.    
Stability 
Stability data from 3 full scale batches of active substance, from the proposed manufacturer, stored in 
the intended commercial package under long term conditions (- 20 ºC) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (5ºC) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Additional supporting data 
on large scale batches, from the proposed manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial package 
for up to 24 months under long term conditions (- 20 ºC), under accelerated conditions (5ºC) and for 
up to 3 months at 30 ºC, have been provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, 
assay, purity, impurities, water content, and microbiological quality.  The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release, a part from the deamindation method, which has been described, and were 
stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications. At -20 °C, a slight decrease in 
assay is observed for some batches, yet as this trend is not observed at 5°C and 30°C, this is 
considered due to analytical variation.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on three batches. Photostability 
studies indicate that while volanesorsen active substance is subject to a slow rate of photodegradation. 
Consequently, special precautions to protect volanesorsen from the effects of light during 
manufacturing, handling, and finished product formulation activities are not required. This is accepted. 
Results on stress conditions (thermal, acidic, basic, oxidative and photo) were also provide on two 
batches. Degradation mainly results in increase of full length phosphate diester, total abasic, early 
eluting impurities and late eluting impurities, and total degradation products. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 2 years stored at -20 °C in the proposed 
container.

Table 1: Composition of volanesorsen finished product 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The pharmaceutical and formulation development section provided is generally satisfactory. The 
finished product formulation is simple and straightforward. The pH, volume and osmolality are 
acceptable for subcutaneous administration. The physico-chemical suitability of the chosen pH of the 
formulation is confirmed by the stability results. The finished product used for all phases of clinical 
development has the same composition as proposed, both in vial and the proposed prefilled syringe 
containers. The manufacturing process development has been described in detail. The proposed 
method of sterilisation has adequately been justified. Although tested at pH 7.5 and 8.5 and not at the 
target pH of 8.0, it is clear that a robust steam sterilisation process is not suitable for this finished 
product. The sterilisation process of the glass syringes with ethylene oxide according ISO 11135 is 
allowed as the drug product concerns an aqueous solution.  Satisfactory additional details on the 
sterilisation process have been provided during the review. Sterilisation of the plunger stoppers by 
gamma irradiation is acceptable. Satisfactory details on the sterilisation process have been provided.  
The  primary  packaging  is  a  single-dose,  Type  I  glass  pre-filled  syringe  with  a  siliconised  chlorobutyl 
rubber stopper and staked needle with shield, filled to deliver 1.5 ml of solution. The material complies 
with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The risk analysis on potential glass delamination confirms that the 
risk for glass delamination to occur over the shelf-life of the medicinal product is low. The results so far 
of the controlled extraction study, the simulated use extraction study, and elemental impurities testing 
of  the  registration  stability  batches  indicate  acceptable  leachable  profile  for  the  finished  product 
formulation in the container closure system. The results of the leachable study are still awaited for and

the  applicant  is  recommended  to  provide  them  post  approval  with  a  variation  and  update  the 
specification  of  the  finished  product  as  needed.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: compounding (compounding, dissolution and 
pH  adjustment), 
filtration  (bioburden  reduction)  and  sterile 
filtration/filling.  Conditions 
like 
temperature,  duration  of  mixing  times,  volume  of  filter  flush,  bubble  points  are  included  in  the 
description. The filters used have a 0.22 µm pore size. The syringes and stoppers are delivered ready 
to use.  
Scheme 1: Finished Product Manufacturing Process 
The  critical  steps  are  compounding  (prior  to  and  after  final  batch  weight  adjustment),  bioburden 
reduction and filling. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. The 
process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing  process  as  it  involves  an  aseptic  filling 
process.  During  the  review,  a  major  objection  was  raised  on  the  absence  of  full-scale  process 
validation  data.  In  response,  results  of  full-scale  process  validation  of  three  batches  have  been 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019

provided which addressed the major objection. The process qualification batches met all requirements 
outlined  in  the  process  qualification  protocol  and  the  results  are  consistent.  Holding  and  processing 
times  have  been  taken  into  account.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The validated 
batch  size  range  targeted  for  commercial  finished  product  manufacturing  has  been  specified. 
Representative batch formulas for the targeted validated batch size range are provided.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (Ph.Eur.),  degree  of  coloration  (Ph.Eur.),  clarity  and  degree  of  opalescence  (Ph.Eur.), 
identification,  assay,  purity,  degradation  products  (all  by  IP-HPLC-UV-MS),  extractable  volume 
(Ph.Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.),  pH  (Ph.Eur.),  osmolality  (USP),  particulate  matter 
(Ph.Eur.),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.Eur.),  sterility  (Ph.Eur.),  container  closure  integrity  (USP)  and 
syringe performance (ISO 11040-8). 
The finished product purity and individual degradation products limits are in line with the active 
substance specification and considered acceptable. The wider limit for total degradation products (NMT 
5.5% for active substance and NMT 7.0% for finished product) is acceptable however it is noted that 
only limited batch data are available and that when further batch data are available it may be possible 
to tighten the limits. Therefore, the applicant is recommended to reassess the acceptance criteria for 
specified degradation products and total degradation products in finished product specification 
following the synthesis of additional batches. The data indicate volanesorsen finished product will not 
deaminate when stored at the proposed recommended storage condition and therefore the proposed 
specification does not include a test for deamination. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The reference standards used for the finished product are the 
same as those used for the active substance. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three registration batches (scale: 8 L, date: 2015) 
manufactured at the proposed commercial site of manufacture according the proposed process and 
packaged in the commercial packaging, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and 
its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  small  scale  batches  (8  L)  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term 
conditions  (stored  at  5±3°C  with  a  6  week  transition  to  30  °C  /  75%  RH)  and  under  accelerated 
conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  were  provided.  The  batches  of  Waylivra  are  representative  to  those 
proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Stability 
studies will also be initiated with the three validation batches (12 L, 30 L, and 30 L). 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  degree  of  coloration,  clarity  and  degree  of  opalescence,  pH, 
assay, purity and impurity profile.  Break-loose force, glide force, needle shield removal force, needle 
hold force, bacterial endotoxins, sterility and particulate matter are tested every year in the long term 
study.  Container  closure  integrity  and  leachables  are  tested  at  the  end  of  the  accelerated  and  long-
term  study.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  the  same  as  used  for  release  and  are  stability 
indicating.  All  results  complied  and  the  only  trend  observed  is  a  minor  increase  in  break  loose  force 
(syringe performance) that was well within the NMT 30 N specification limit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019

In  addition,  three  batches  were  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Assay,  purity,  degradation  products,  appearance, 
degree of coloration, clarity and degree of opalescence, particulate matter and pH were tested. For the 
unprotected  product  a  decrease  in  full-length  n  (purity)  and  increases  of  degradation  products  full-
length  (P=O),  total  abasic,  late  eluting  impurities,  and  T=total  degradation  products  was  observed, 
which was not observed for the dark control and the product stored in the carton box. In view of that, 
the product should be stored in the carton box to protect from light. 
Three cycles of freeze-thaw storage were completed on two batches of the product; however, since the 
container  closure  integrity  has  not  been  verified  in  the  frozen  state  over  time  or  when  exposed  to 
freeze thawing, thus the product is not to be frozen. Intrinsic stability and degradation pathways and 
products  of  the  finished  product  were  evaluated  by  exposing  samples  to  forced  thermal  degradation 
(80 °C, 2 weeks) and forced photodegradation (ICH Q1B, option 2; 6 × 106 lux hours CWL and 1073 
watt  hours/m2  UVA).  Stressed  and  control  samples  were  analyzed  for  assay,  purity  and  degradation 
products by IP-HPLC-UV-MS and for deamination by IPHPLC-TOF-MS. 
In line with ICH Q1E, extrapolation of 24 months long-term data to 30 months is allowed. The 
proposed shelf-life of 30 months when stored refrigerated at 2° to 8°C, in the original carton to protect 
from light, including 6 weeks transition not above 30°C, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) can be 
accepted.  
Adventitious agents 
In  accordance  with  Directives  2001/83/EC  and  2003/63/EC,  starting  materials,  packaging  materials 
with product contact, process materials, media fill components and cleaning detergents are compliant 
with  chapter  5.2.8  "Minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal  spongiform  encephalopathy  agents  via 
human and veterinary medicinal products" of Ph.Eur. and "Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products” 
(EMA/410/01/current version). 
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. During the review of 
the application, three recommendations have been given to the applicant in reference to tighten the 
criteria of the active substance and finished product once more experience with commercial 
manufactured is gained and to evaluate the results of the extractable and leachable studies and to 
implement any necessary control. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends some points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical program with volanesorsen was conducted using in vitro and in vivo studies to support 
chronic subcutaneous (SC) administration for the treatment of patients with FCS. The non-clinical 
testing strategy for volanesorsen followed a development pathway in line with existing regulatory 
guidance (ICH M3R2). The objectives of the non-clinical program were to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamic activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of volanesorsen.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Volanesorsen was evaluated in vitro in human and monkey primary hepatocytes, human HepG2 
hepatoma cells, APOC3 transgenic mouse primary hepatocytes and mice containing the human APOC3 
transgene.  The pharmacology of inhibiting apoC-III with species-specific ASOs was also examined in 
mice, rats, hamsters and monkeys.   
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Identification of ISIS 304801 (Volanesorsen) and Species-Specific ApoC-III ASOs 
The APOC3 gene, which is conserved in eukaryotes, is ~500 base pairs in length, containing 3 Introns 
and 4 Exons. The human, rhesus monkey, and cynomolgus monkey genes are highly conserved with 
~93% homology. To identify potential human candidates, ~350 second-generation 2′-O-methoxyethyl 
chimeric ASOs were screened against ~200 sites.  
ISIS 304801 (volanesorsen) was identified as the optimal 2′-MOE antisense inhibitor of human apoC-
III on the basis of its consistent and potent activity and maximal efficacy.  
The binding site for ISIS 304801 lies within the 3′ untranslated region of the apoC-III mRNA transcript 
at position 489-508 bp, and based on in silico analysis, it is not predicted to target any other human 
gene. A bioinformatic analysis of the human transcripts in the NCBI Reference Sequence Database 
using the bowtie algorithm (Langmead et al. 2009) predicts ISIS 304801 is not homologous to any 
regions of the human transcriptome with either a single nucleotide mismatch, or with 16 or more 
consecutive nucleotide matches (data not shown).  
Additional off-target analysis identified all 2-base mismatches and the potential effects of volanesorsen 
on these transcripts.  There were 3 expressed putative potential off-targets with 2 mismatches 
identified:  STIM2, RAC1 and RAC1P2.  The sequence of the pseudogene RAC1P2 was determined to be 
98% homologous to RAC1, and as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays 
that distinguish RAC1 and RAC1P2 are not commercially available, one assay was used to measure 
both transcripts.  At the highest concentration tested of 20 µM there was approximately 24% inhibition 
of RAC1, whereas STIM2, inhibition of 53% was reached at a concentration of 20 µM. 
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ISIS 304801 against apoC-III mRNA is > 200-fold 
lower than the IC50 against the 3 expressed off-targets.  At a concentration that produced near

Page 19/121 
 
 
 
 
maximal reduction of apoC-III mRNA (20 µM), no significant change was seen in the expressed 
putative off-targets.   
While monkeys share the same sequence at this site, due to a lack of sequence homology in other 
species, different 2′-MOE ASOs (ISIS 440670, ISIS 440726, ISIS 353982, ISIS 353977, or ISIS 
352952) were employed in studies targeting mouse, rat or hamster apoC-III, respectively (Table 2).

In Vitro Pharmacodynamics 
The in vitro pharmacological activity of volanesorsen was characterized in a human hepatoma cell line 
(HepG2) cells (study EX/3253:141), as well as in primary human hepatocytes (study EX/3270:139), 
cynomolgus monkeys (study EX/3270:146) and APOC3 transgenic (Tg) mice (study EX/3270:067). In 
these experiments, ISIS 304801 selectively reduced apoC-III mRNA in a concentration-dependent 
manner (data not shown). In human primary hepatocytes an IC50 of 2 nM was calculated. 
In Vivo Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacologic effects of 2ʹ-MOE ASOs designed to inhibit apoC-III were examined in mice, rats, 
hamsters and non-human primate models. Because of the divergence between the mouse, hamster 
and human apoC-III sequences, species-specific ASOs were employed in their respective in vivo 
evaluations. 
Rodent Models 
Inhibition of hepatic apoC-III expression by 2′-MOE ASOs consistently and significantly reduced hepatic 
mRNA and protein, with concomitant reductions in serum apoC-III, VLDL-C and TG levels in several 
models and species, including human APOC3 transgenic mice, mouse, rat and hamster (Table 3).

Monkey model 
Because the binding site for volanesorsen is 100% homologous between rhesus monkey and human 
apoC-III mRNAs and lipid metabolism in nonhuman primates resembles that observed in humans, the 
effects of volanesorsen in rhesus monkeys that were made hypertriglyceridemic via administration of a 
high-fructose supplement were evaluated. 
Volanesorsen significantly reduced rhesus monkey hepatic mRNA and plasma apoC-III levels in a 
concentration dependent manner, (Figure 2).   
Figure 2. Reduction in Hepatic ApoC-III mRNA and Protein After 12-Week Administration of 
ISIS 304801 in HTG Rhesus Monkeys 
Monkeys (n = 5 per group) were treated twice weekly with a total dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/wk ISIS 304801 or 
PBS for 12 weeks.  At study termination, hepatic apoC-III mRNA expression (A) was measured by qPCR and plasma 
apoC-III (B) was quantified on a clinical analyzer using a commercially available turbidometric assay (Kamiya 
Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA).  Data are plotted as mean (± SD) for the qPCR and the mean (± SEM) for the plasma 
samples.  *Significant difference from PBS cohort using one way ANOVA post hoc Tukey’s multicomparison test (p < 
0.05) 
Since the apoC-III reductions observed at the 10 mg/kg/wk were similar to results at the higher dose 
levels, further analyses were focused only on the 10 mg/kg/wk cohort.  Reductions in TG, VLDL and 
chylomicron TG levels were also observed (Figure 3), whilst HDL-C levels increased with volanesorsen 
treatment (Figure 4).

Monkeys (n = 5 per group) were treated for a total weekly dose of 10 mg/kg/wk ISIS 304801 or PBS over 12 weeks 
and plasma total TG (A), and VLDL and chylomicron TG levels (B) levels were quantified using NMR analysis 
(Liposcience, Raleigh, NC).  Data are plotted as mean (± SEM).  *Significant difference from PBS cohort using one 
way ANOVA post hoc Tukey’s multicomparison test (p < 0.05) 
After 10 weeks of treatment, postprandial TG clearance was increased by 38% and was similar to that 
observed in the C57BL/6 fat clearance study described above (EX/3309:271).  Finally, volanesorsen 
did not significantly increase liver triglyceride levels in these animals (data not shown).

Detailed subjective observations of the mice were performed before dosing and at 30, 90, 150 and 300 
min after administration of ISIS 304801 and again on Day 2. 
No mortality or signs of clinical toxicity were observed during the study. No marked or statistically 
significant changes relative to the vehicle-treated control group were observed in locomotor activity or 
body temperature parameters.   
Respiratory system 
Study ISIS 301804-AS04: mice were administered vehicle control (phosphate buffered saline) or ISIS 
304801 by a single SC injection at dose levels of 0, 50, 100, and 250 mg/kg. Baclofen was used as a 
positive control and confirmed the validity of the assay. 
A single animal receiving 250 mg/kg ISIS 304801 was found dead during the study.  Upon gross 
examination, the lungs appeared congested and patchy. A decrease (35% relative to control) in 
respiratory rate was observed at the 250 mg/kg dose group by 180 min post-dose that fully reversed 
by 210 min. No changes in pulmonary function parameters were observed at doses ≤ 100 mg/kg.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or excretion (ADME) of volanesorsen were assessed in 
the mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey. In vitro studies characterized the plasma protein binding across 
species, and evaluated the potential for interactions of volanesorsen with human cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes and transporters.

Volanesorsen PK in mice was further studied following once weekly SC administration for 13 weeks in 
as part of the 2-year carcinogenicity study (study 304801-AS15). Following SC administration, 
volanesorsen was absorbed rapidly into the systemic circulation with Tmax observed at 0.5 to 1 hours. 
After achieving Cmax, the plasma concentrations then rapidly declined over the next 24 to 48 hours 
following SC administration. No large gender-difference in plasma TK was observed over the dose 
range studied at 6 to 40 mg/kg. 
Plasma peak (Cmax) and total (AUC0-24h, AUC0-48h, and, AUC0-168h) exposures were dose-dependent and 
increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner following 13 weeks of SC administrations of 
volanesorsen. MRT0-48h was about 5 hours. 
Rats 
The PK of volanesorsen was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats following a single SC dose of 
5 mg/kg [3H]volanesorsen (study 304801-APK02). Following a single SC injection of 5 mg/kg 
formulated [3H]volanesorsen to rats, concentrations of the total radioactivity in blood and plasma 
decreased in a bi-exponential fashion with time. Blood and plasma clearance was initially rapid 
followed by a slow terminal elimination phase to the end of the study period. Radioactivity was mainly 
associated with the plasma and not the blood cell components, with mean whole blood to plasma ratios 
of approximately 0.53–0.83 from 0 to 48 hours after the 5 mg/kg dose. 
Maximal blood and plasma levels were observed at 1 hour post-dose. The Cmax of radioactivity in whole 
blood was 5.1 µg equivalent/mL and concentrations declined thereafter such that they were below the 
limit of detection (0.024–0.031 µg/mL) at 672 hours and beyond. The Cmax in plasma was 6.96 µg 
equivalents/mL. Concentrations declined thereafter such that they were below the limit of detection 
(0.014–0.021 µg/mL) at 336 hours and beyond. The apparent t1/2 of total radioactivity in plasma and 
blood was approximately 30.2 and 119 hours, respectively, which are underestimates due to several 
below quantification values (BLQ) in the elimination phase. 
Volanesorsen PK was further studied following once weekly SC administration for 13 weeks in male and 
female rats as part of the 2-year carcinogenicity study (study 304801-AS16, Table 5.

Monkey 
Volanesorsen plasma PK following IV infusion and SC administration in monkeys was studied in a 13-
week toxicology study (study 304801-AS02). Following IV administration the plasma PK profiles 
exhibited apparent multi-phasic disposition, with a rapid distribution phase (mean residence time 
[MRTlast] values of ~2 hours). Peak plasma concentrations occurred at the first time point taken 
following the end of the 1-hour IV infusion. Exposure was dose-dependent and dose-proportional for 
the 3 dose levels tested (4, 8 and 12 mg/kg).  
Following SC administration, plasma concentrations peaked between 1 to 4 hours, and then decreased 
in an apparent multi-exponential fashion with time. A longer MRTlast was observed (~6 to 9 hours) 
after SC administration compared to IV administration. 
Dose-dependency of peak (Cmax) and total (AUC) plasma exposure measures in monkeys to 
volanesorsen after IV dosing on days 1, 3 and 5 followed by weekly SC dosing was demonstrated 
across the entire dose range tested and on all dose days examined. Mean AUC0-48h values after SC and 
IV dosing appeared similar, indicating near complete absorption with SC administration. Based on 
plasma exposure (mean AUC0-48h), the estimated absolute bioavailability after 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg SC 
dosing ranged from 66–110%. The estimated mean apparent t1/2 values (range: 13–36 days) appear 
generally comparable to estimated mean tissue half-life values (range: 13–19 days), consistent with 
expected equilibrium between plasma post-distribution concentrations and tissue concentrations. 
Plasma trough concentrations showed a dose dependent trough (pre-dose) levels were observed after 
administration of the loading doses (Day 7), for all interim samples, and at the end of dosing (Day 91). 
In addition, an accumulation of plasma trough concentrations was found after multiple doses. 
Volanesorsen plasma PK following SC administration in male and female monkeys were further studied 
in the 39-week toxicity study (study 304801-AS11). Results are summarised in Table 6.

Dose-dependent increases in mean trough (post-distribution phase) plasma concentrations were also 
observed in this study; with post-distribution plasma concentrations typically expected to be in 
equilibrium with the major tissues of distribution (i.e., reflecting accumulation and slow tissue 
elimination of volanesorsen). However, mean and median plasma trough values continued to increase 
after the loading dose phase of the study; with the mean increasing 4.4- to 15.4-fold (across the dose 
groups) by Day 147 compared to Day 14 (the start of the maintenance dosing phase) when the tissues 
would have been expected to have reached steady state 
Distribution 
Mouse 
Kidney and liver were evaluated in mice after multiple SC doses of volanesorsen from 3 to 100 mg/kg 
for up to 6 weeks in the non-GLP study 304801-APK01. Higher volanesorsen mean tissue 
concentrations were observed in the liver than kidney at the 2 higher doses evaluated. Exposure 
generally increased less than dose-proportionally (~9- and 4- fold increase for liver and kidney, 
respectively), over the evaluated 33.3-fold dose range.  
Kidney and liver were evaluated in mice after multiple SC doses of volanesorsen from 4 to 100 mg/kg 
for up to 13 weeks in study 304801-AS01. Similar volanesorsen mean tissue concentrations were 
observed in liver and kidney at the doses evaluated and generally increased but less than 
dose-proportionally (8.5- to 11.7-fold increase), over the evaluated 25-fold dose range. Consistent 
mean tissue concentrations were observed at 6 and 13 weeks (Days 44 and 93, respectively) 
indicating attainment of approximate steady-state conditions in tissues by 6 weeks with the employed 
dosing regimen. Estimated tissue elimination half-life values at the 100 mg/kg dose level were 21.7 
and 25.8 days for kidney and liver, respectively. 
Kidney and liver were further evaluated in the mouse carcinogenicity study after multiple SC doses of 
volanesorsen from 6 to 40 mg/kg for 13 weeks in toxicokinetic satellite animals in study 304801-AS15. 
Tissue exposure of volanesorsen was dose-dependent following 13 weeks of treatment; however, the 
increases in kidney and liver concentrations were less than dose-proportional with an observed 2.5- 
and 4.9-fold increase, respectively, over the 6.7-fold increase in dose. Liver concentrations were 
generally higher than kidney concentrations at equivalent dose levels. Although kidney concentrations 
in female mice were consistently higher (up to 2.5-fold) compared to males, no gender difference was 
observed in mouse liver concentrations. 
The tissue concentrations of volanesorsen were also evaluated in main carcinogenicity study animals at 
the terminal necropsy intervals of the study (which varied by group due to survival). Tissue exposure 
of volanesorsen was also dose-dependent at the terminal necropsy following treatment with 
volanesorsen up to 2 years over a dose range of 6 to 40 mg/kg.

Liver and kidney were evaluated in mice following multiple SC doses of volanesorsen from 3 to 
80 mg/kg in mice for up to 26 weeks in study 304801-AS10. In this study, mean kidney (but not liver) 
concentrations on Day 184 appeared consistently higher in female compared to male mice for all doses 
studied. Mean kidney concentrations increased either about or less than dose-proportionally (13.5-fold 
for males, 25.4-fold for females) over the evaluated 26.7-fold dose range. Mean liver concentrations 
also increased less than dose-proportionally (8-fold) over the evaluated 26.7-fold dose range. Slow 
clearance of volanesorsen from the evaluated tissues was observed during the 13-week recovery 
period, with concentrations of volanesorsen still measurable at the end of the recovery period 
(Day 273) in the high dose group (but not the 10 mg/kg dose group). Estimated mean tissue half-life 
values (based on 2 available mean time points only) at the 80 mg/kg dose level were 17.1 and 
26.3 days for the kidney and liver, respectively. 
Rat  
Tissue distribution of radioactivity was studied in Sprague-Dawley rat following a single SC 
administration of 5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg [3H] volanesorsen in study 304801-APK02.  
With respect to blood partition, radioactivity was mainly associated with the plasma and not the blood 
cell components, with mean whole blood-to-plasma ratios of approximately 0.53-0.83 from 0 to 
48 hours after the 5 mg/kg dose. 
The kidneys contained the highest levels of radioactivity at all time points evaluated, followed by the 
injection site, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow. The maximum levels of total 
radioactivity in kidney, injection site, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, and bone marrow were 107, 64.4, 
9.99, 7.95, and 7.08 µg equivalents/g, respectively. Tissues that contained moderate levels of 
radioactivity (tissues with maximum concentrations between 1 and 5 µg equivalents/g) were thyroid, 
spleen, bone, pancreas, walls of the gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands, testes, skin, prostate and 
peri-renal fat. Very little radioactivity was associated with the brain and spinal cord with a mean 
maximum level of 0.060 and 0.194 µg equivalents/g, respectively. 
For most tissues, maximum concentrations were observed at 24 or 48 hours after the 5 mg/kg dose. 
Mean concentrations of radioactivity in kidney and liver declined with a half-life of 23.0 and 13.6 days, 
respectively. Elimination of radioactivity from all tissues was slow with estimated terminal half-life 
values ranging from 10.5 to 77.9 days, reflecting the slow clearance of [3H]volanesorsen-related 
radioactivity from tissues. 
Tissue concentrations of radioactivity post-dose following administration at 25 mg/kg SC were 
comparable with the results obtained with the lower dose.  
Kidney and liver distribution of volanesorsen in rats was evaluated following 0.2 to 5 mg/kg SC weekly 
administration of volanesorsen for 13 weeks during the 2-year carcinogenicity study (study 304801-
AS16). The mean kidney and liver concentrations were BLQ at the 0.2 mg/kg dose and increased 
between the 1 to 5 mg/kg doses, in a greater than dose-proportional manner in this low dose range. 
The tissue levels were similar between male and female rats. 
Tissue distribution of volanesorsen in rats following 3 to 80 mg/kg SC administration of volanesorsen 
for up to 26 weeks was investigated in study 304801-AS12. Mean liver and kidney concentrations 
indicated apparent gender-independent biodistributio and increased less than dose-proportionally 
(2.8-fold increase for kidney, 16.7-fold for liver) over the 26-fold dose range. Kidney contained higher 
concentrations than liver in rats at the 3 lower dose levels, while liver concentrations were similar to 
kidney concentrations in rats at the 80 mg/kg dose level, the latter likely due to saturation of uptake 
to the kidney. Mean kidney and liver concentrations of volanesorsen were typically similar at Day 93 
and Day 184 or Day 121, indicating approximately steady-state was achieved in the tissues by 
13 weeks.

Monkey 
In monkeys the mean kidney cortex concentrations were higher than mean liver concentrations as 
measured in study 304801-AS02. Mean kidney and liver concentrations generally increased 
dose-dependently, but less than dose-proportionally for the highest dose (4.4- to 11.4- and 3.4- to 
4.5 fold, respectively), over the evaluated 10-fold dose range. Slow clearance from tissue led to 
accumulation of volanesorsen following every-other-day and weekly administration. For kidney cortex 
and liver, after 4 loading doses of 8 mg/kg SC, the mean tissue concentrations at 48 hours after 
dosing (Day 9) were approximately 2.3- to 3.7-fold higher than that after a single dose (Day 3) 
consistent with expected tissue accumulation/ Reasonably consistent tissue concentrations were 
observed at 6 and 13 weeks (Days 44 and 93, respectively) for Groups 2 through 5, indicating 
attainment of approximate steady-state conditions in tissues by 6 weeks with the employed dosing 
regimen.  
For all evaluated dose levels, volanesorsen concentrations 48 hours after the last dose (Day 93) were 
several hundred-to several thousand-fold higher in kidney cortex and liver than in plasma. 
Volanesorsen was cleared slowly from kidney cortex and liver after the 13-week administration of 4 to 
40 mg/kg volanesorsen, with an estimated elimination half-life of 12.5 days in kidneys cortex and 18.9 
days in liver. 
Tissue distribution of volanesorsen in monkeys following 3 to 20 mg/kg administration of volanesorsen 
for up to 39 weeks (study 304801-AS11) was similar to that seen in the 13-week study 304801-AS02. 
Mean kidney cortex and liver concentrations increased dose-dependently. Following Day 275, the 
increase in exposure was slightly less than proportional to dose for liver (3.0-fold) and kidney cortex 
(4.2-fold) over the 6.6-fold dosing range. In the 2 groups where 6-month data from the interim 
necropsy was also obtained, the increase was also dose-proportional for both tissues. Based on the 
similarity of mean tissue concentrations between Days 184 and 275 across all dose groups, 
steady-state tissue concentrations appear to have been achieved by 6 months of treatment (Day 184) 
in this study. Typically, only moderate inter-animal variability in evaluated tissue concentrations was 
observed across dose levels and evaluated time points. Estimated apparent elimination half-life values 
for volanesorsen in kidney cortex and liver were 32 and 25 days, respectively.  
Protein Binding and Distribution in Blood Cells 
Volanesorsen was highly bound to plasma proteins over the evaluated volanesorsen plasma 
concentration range (5 and 150 µg/mL) in human, monkey, and mouse (Table 7).

Placental Transfer and Tissue Distribution in Reproductive Animals  
The effects of volanesorsen on fertility and embryo/fetal development were assessed in mice and 
rabbits following SC injection (study 304801-AS07 and -AS09, respectively). In mice, hepatic tissue 
concentrations of intact volanesorsen increased in a dose-dependent manner in paternal and maternal 
animals, and were 394 and 356 μg/g, respectively, at the highest dose tested (87.5 mg/kg/wk).

Relatively low concentrations of volanesorsen were measurable in placental tissue (13.5 μg/g), while 
no measurable levels were seen in fetal tissue (i.e., BLQ < 10 μg/g). Similarly in the rabbit (study 
304801-AS09), dose-dependent and time-dependent exposure was seen in the maternal liver mean 
concentrations, with the highest concentration being observed at the highest dose on gestation day 
(GD) 20 (533 ± 131 µg/g). Quantifiable placental exposure was only observed in the highest dose 
group at GD20 (37.4 ± 12.7 µg/g), and no quantifiable exposure was seen in any evaluated fetal 
livers, indicating that volanesorsen is not readily transported to the embryo or fetus. 
Metabolism 
The in vivo metabolite profile of volanesorsen was studied in mouse, rat, monkey, and humans using 
selected samples collected from a number of studies.   
Plasma 
Intact volanesorsen was the most abundant oligonucleotide in mouse, monkey, and human plasma. 
Volanesorsen accounted for >60% of the total oligonucleotides detected in plasma. Other drug-related 
moieties detected in plasma included a 19-mer oligonucleotide (N-1 from 3′-end only) and other 
metabolites, ranging from 12-mers down to 5-mers. Each individual metabolite detected was ≤1% of 
the total oligonucleotides detected in the plasma, except for the 3′-end deletion 5-mer and the 19-mer 
detected in the mouse samples collected 7 days post-dose, which accounted up to approximately 
24% and 12% of the oligonucleotides detected, respectively. No detectable human-specific major or 
minor metabolites were present in human plasma.  
Tissue 
Relatively low volanesorsen metabolite levels (up to 20% of parent drug but typically < 10%) were 
measured in kidney and liver samples from mouse, rat, and monkey by a HPLC-PDA method: 12 and 
100 mg/kg SC dosing for 6 and 13 weeks and at the end of recovery in mice, 80 mg/kg SC for 13 
weeks and 17 weeks in rats, and 12 mg/kg SC for 6 weeks and 13 weeks and at the end of recovery in 
monkeys. These results are consistent with relatively slow but extensive formation of chain-shortened 
metabolites from the parent drug. 
Urine 
Metabolites excreted in urine from mice, monkeys, and humans were assessed by IP-HPLC-MS. In 
urine, metabolites ranging from 5-mer to 19-mer were identified. Compared to monkey and human 
urine, there was a greater amount of intact volanesorsen observed in mouse urine. In monkey and 
human urine, there was a great abundance of chain-shortened oligonucleotides observed together with 
the intact oligonucleotide.  
In vivo metabolism of volanesorsen was also studied in rats following a single SC administration of 
5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg [3H]volanesorsen ( Study 304801-APK02).  
Plasma 
Unchanged volanesorsen accounted for the majority of total plasma radioactivity (approximately 70%) 
in plasma at 2 hours. Trace amounts of metabolites were below detection by LC-MS and no 
radiolabelled metabolites were identified in plasma at either 2 hours or 24 hours. The minimal 
proportion of metabolites observed in plasma as compared to unchanged volanesorsen confirmed 
distribution rather than metabolism as the major contributing factor to the initial rapid plasma 
clearance. 
The predominant component in the kidney and liver at 24 hours was unchanged volanesorsen, with low 
levels of 3′-deletion metabolites (6-mer or longer) (total of up to approximately 6% and 3% of dose in 
kidney and liver, respectively) also present. 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 29/121 
 
 
 
Excreta 
Urine collected from 0 to 6 hours and 6 to 24 hours contained significant amounts of radiolabelled 
metabolites of approximately 5 to 8 nucleotides in length. The major urinary components (6-mer and 
7-mer, 3′-deletion) each accounted for 3 to 5% of dose while the more minor components (5-mer from 
3′-deletion, 8-mer from 3′-deletion, and unidentifiable metabolite longer than 8-mer in length) each 
represented approximately 1% of dose. By comparing the proportions of metabolites excreted in urine, 
shorter oligonucleotides such as 6-mer and 7-mer from 3′-deletion are more readily excreted 
compared to unchanged volanesorsen likely due to reduced tissue and plasma protein binding. 
Each of the metabolites identified in feces accounted for less than 0.3% of the administered dose over 
the 0- to 24-hour interval (5 and 25 mg/kg) among which 6-mer and 7-mer from 3′-deletion were the 
major components in feces. 
Up to 18 radioactive components were present in plasma, excreta and tissues, of which 6- and 7-mer 
oligonucleotides following 3′-deletion were the major excreted metabolites. 
Considering the small fraction of drug metabolized and excreted during the early collection interval, 
this confirms the primary mechanism of clearance from plasma as rapid uptake into tissue. Subsequent 
tissue clearance of the parent drug was slow, followed by elimination of metabolites in urine and feces. 
No sex difference was noted in the metabolism of volanesorsen following a 25 mg/kg dose, and there 
were no appreciable differences following a 5-fold increase in dose. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro studies using primary human hepatocytes showed that volanesorsen up to 100 µM does not 
induce or inhibit major cytochrome P450 isoforms. Volanesorsen was also shown not to be a substrate 
or inhibitor of major drug transporters (see also Clinical Aspects of this Report). The applicant 
therefore conisdered that volanesorsen has a very low potential for involvement in CYP- or transporter-
mediated drug-drug interactions and did not submit dedicated drug interaction studies. 
Excretion 
Excretion and mass balance for volanesorsen were investigated in rats following a single SC 
administration of 5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg [3H]volanesorsen (study 304801-APK02). 
After a single 5 mg/kg dose, excretion of [3H]volanesorsen-related radioactivity in urine and faeces 
was slow and occurred mainly via urinary excretion, and to a lesser extent fecal elimination (i.e., only 
approximately 14% of administered dose was eliminated in the excreta within the first 24 hours). After 
the first 24 hours and up to 56 days post-dose, less than 2% of the administered dose was excreted 
daily. Less than 25% of dose was recovered in excreta by 168 hours post-dose, which increased to 
approximately 41% of dose by 28 days and up to 60% of dose by 56 days post-dose. 
The mean overall recovery of radioactivity from excreta and tissues (including residual carcass) over 
the 56-day collection period was 77% of dose. The largest proportion of excreted radioactivity was 
recovered in urine (mean of 48% dose), 7.67% of dose in faeces and 1.98% of dose in cage washings, 
and 19.1% of the administered dose remained tissues/carcass, of which the kidneys and liver 
contained 5.81% and 1.20% of dose respectively, 1.22% of the dose remained associated with the 
injection site, and 6.83% of dose in the carcass (including fat, muscle, skin, bone and bone marrow). 
All other tissues each accounted for 0.53% or less of the dose. 
After a single 25 mg/kg dose, the recovery of radioactivity from excreta over the first 24-hour period 
was 23.8% and 20.0% of dose in male and female rat, respectively, of which almost all was in the 
urine (only 0.97% and 0.48% of the dose, respectively in the faeces). The rate of urinary excretion 
was slightly higher for 25 mg/kg than that for the 5 mg/kg dose.

Transfer of volanesorsen into milk was evaluated in a pre- and post-natal development study in mice. 
The mean concentrations of volanesorsen in breast milk from lactating female mice increased in a 
dose-dependent manner. The mean volanesorsen concentration in milk was 0.6 μg/ml at the high dose 
of 87.5 mg/kg/wk while the mean volanesorsen concentration in maternal liver was 492 μg/g at the 
same dose level. 
Immunogenicity studies 
The presence of anti-volanesorsen antibodies specific to volanesorsen was assessed using a standard 
ELISA type assay in chronic toxicology studies in mice and monkeys. None of the evaluated mice 
tested positive for anti-volanesorsen antibodies (study 304801-AS10). 
The incidence of anti-volanesorsen antibody, time of onset, and antibody titer values in monkeys in 
study 304801-AS11 are summarized in Table 8.

The presence of anti-volanesorsen antibodies resulted in an increase in the median plasma trough 
concentrations of approximately 1.2- to 14-fold in the samples collected approximately 3 months or 
later after initiation of dosing in all dose groups. In general, the median trough plasma concentrations 
in IM-positive monkeys after 3 months of dosing were up to approximately 14-fold higher than the 
median trough plasma concentrations in the IM-negative monkeys, consistent with retention of 
antibody-bound volanesorsen in circulation (study 304801-AS11, amendment 1, Table 7). However, 
similar plasma Cmax, AUC0-48h, and half-life were observed between IM-negative and IM-positive 
animals though based on a limited sample size with relevant PK parameters. Similarly, the presence of 
antibodies to volanesorsen was not associated with consistent changes in tissue (liver and kidney) 
concentrations of volanesorsen.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted in mice (Segment I/II/III), and 
rabbits (Segment II) (Study Nos. 304801-AS07, -AS08, -AS09 and -AS14). Dams were treated on 
alternate days during gestation to insure adequate exposure to the developing conceptus (Lebrec, 
Cowan et al. 2011, Cavagnaro, Berman et al. 2014). Thus, the total weekly dose in the mouse Seg I/II 
study (87.5 mg/kg/wk) and the rabbit Seg II (52 mg/kg/wk) were comparable to the high doses used 
in the general toxicology studies.

No effects 
Exposure to the dams was confirmed by measuring maternal liver concentrations. The concentration of 
volanesorsen was also measured in placental tissue, but there was little drug measured (detected only 
at 1/10th the maternal liver concentration at the mid and high dose levels) and none was detected in 
foetal liver.   
Maternal toxicity observed in mice consisted of decreases in mean PLT count, as well as, increases in 
spleen weight, circulating monocytes, and serum cytokines at the high dose only. Mice treated with the 
murine apoC-III inhibitor, mRNA levels reduced to 17 and 36% of control in male and female mice, 
respectively. This reduction in apoC-III RNA correlated with triglyceride levels that were 40% of 
control, an effect that was ascribed to the intended pharmacologic effect. 
Maternal toxicity in rabbits was characterized by reductions in body weight and food consumption 
(Study No. 304801-AS09). Four dams treated with 52.5 mg/kg/wk aborted or delivered early, 
presumably attributable to the decreased food consumption. Decreases in fetal body weight observed 
at 52.5 mg/kg/wk were considered to be secondary to decreased maternal body weight and food 
consumption, rather than a direct effect of volanesorsen on foetal development. 
An assessment of pre- and postnatal toxicity was performed using subcutaneous administration of 
volanesorsen or the murine-specific apoC-III inhibitor (ISIS 440670) on alternate days to pregnant 
female mice at doses up to 87.5 mg/kg/wk from Day 6 of gestation to Day 21 postpartum. There were 
increases in spleen, kidney, and liver weights of the treated dams. Volanesorsen was detected in 
expressed milk at a concentration of ≤0.6 µg/ml. There were also no adverse effects on the 
reproductive function of the F1 generation. There were no effects in mice treated with the murine-
specific inhibitor.  
Toxicokinetic data 
An overview of toxikokinetic data are summarised in Table 15.

Local Tolerance  
Formal studies evaluating local tolerance were not conducted however the injection sites were 
evaluated as part of the repeat-dose studies in mice, rats and monkeys which did not reveal any 
evidence of substantive irritation.  
Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities 
The potential toxicity of volanesorsen and related impurities was evaluated in CD-1 mice after 13 
weeks of SC treatment. Three (3) different formulations of impurity mixtures were evaluated (ISIS 
304801 Impurity Mixture 1, 2, and 3).  
There were no volanesorsen-related changes in mortality, clinical signs, ophthalmology 
andmacroscopic observation in this study. Decreases in body weight, body weight gain and/or food 
consumption were observed in females at receiving 10 or 30 mg/kg/wk Impurity Mixture groups 
compared to volanesorsen at the same dose. Accumulation of basophilic granules was observed in 
multiple tissues in both sexes and across treatment groups. These changes were considered test 
article-related, but not adverse, as they were attributable to a known class effects of antisense 
oligonucleotide administration. Increased mixed cell infiltration in the liver and extramedullary 
hemopoiesis in the spleen was observed in both sexes at all 10 and 30 mg/kg/wk groups. This change 
was considered test article-related but not adverse. Overall, there were no discernible histological 
differences among the test article treated groups with volanesorsen or associated Impurity Mixtures. 
There were no additional toxicities that could be attributed to any of the 3 impurity mixtures 
evaluated. 
Other studies 
Because of the observed platelet effects in monkeys, the applicant evaluated platelet function and 
plasma concentrations of volanesorsen after a 13-week dosing period when administered SC to 
cynomolgus monkeys. There was no effect on PLT function as measured by aggregometry or the PFA-
100 instrument following 5 or 10 mg/kg/wk for 13 weeks.  
In addition, the applicant assessed in vitro, if volanesorsen directly activated platelets from normal 
human donors at clinically-relevant concentrations. Given the intended patient population (FCS) for 
volanesorsen, analysis was also conducted using purified chylomicrons and VLDL to examine their 
potential concentration-dependent effect on PLT activation. The positive control, ADP, produced the 
expected concentration dependent increase in PAC-1 and CD62P, demonstrating PLT activation by ADP. 
Clinically-relevant concentrations of volanesorsen used in this experiment ranged from 0.4 to 4 μM. 
The highest concentration is 2- to 4 times the plasma Cmax with a dose of 300 mg/wk volanesorsen 
administered to patients in clinical trials. There was no significant increase in either activation marker 
for volanesorsen. There was a concentration-dependent increase in PLT activation markers in PLTs 
exposed to chylomicrons, but not VLDL. A 2- to 10-fold increase in PLT activation was observed from 
samples from two donors.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
(N) 
N 
Binding of ISIS 301804 to APOC-III mRNA has been shown in vitro, resulting in reduced mRNA and 
protein levels. The applicant mentions that ISIS 301804 is highly selective based on a bioinformatic 
analysis of the human transcripts 
No targets with only 1 mismatch were identified, and there were only 3 targets with 2 mismatches. 
These were RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin), RAC1P2 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 
1 pseudogene 2), and STIM2 (stromal interaction molecule 2). The half maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) of ISIS 304801 against apoC-III mRNA was > 200 fold lower than the IC50 
against the 3 expressed off-targets.  At a concentration that produced near maximal reduction of 
apoC-III mRNA (20 µM), no significant change was seen in the expressed putative off-targets.   
Due to difference in the potency/optimisation of volanesorsen towards the target apoC-III mRNA from 
human and monkey origin, the relationship between volanesorsen plasma and liver exposure and PD 
activity cannot directly be translated to man. Dose levels of volanesorsen < 10 mg/kg were not tested 
in the monkey to support the proposed clinical dose of 300 mg /week (and even lower dose) based on 
mg/kg extrapolation. However, by applying an inhibitory Emax model the Applicant showed that the 
dose level of 5 mg/kg is anticipated to result in comparable efficacy in the monkey (as assessed by 
liver Apo-CIII mRNA & plasma Apo-CIII Protein levels) as the dose of 10 mg/kg and therefore to 
support efficacy at the intended posology as well as at lower dose levels in view of the non-linear dose 
relationship. The PD study conducted in the monkey is supportive for a potential therapeutic benefit at 
300 mg/kg as well as at a reduced dose level in case of thrombocytopenia.  
The pharmacokinetics, metabolism and elimination were studied primarily in mice, rats, and monkeys. 
Monkey is considered the most relevant species to humans based on the general pharmacokinetic 
behavior of 2’-MOE ASOs (plasma AUC, Cmax, and clearance). 
In general, the absorption of volanesorsen following single and multiple SC administration was fast in 
mice, rats and monkeys with a Tmax similar to humans. Thereafter, volanesorsen declined quickly in a 
multi-phasic manner indicating a fast distribution to the tissues, of which, depending on the species,

liver and/or kidney accumulated most. Following single or multiple SC dosing a greater than dose-
proportional increase in exposure was found. In mouse and monkey, as in humans, there was no clear 
evidence of plasma AUC accumulation following repeated dosing of volanesorsen although plasma 
trough concentrations strongly increased (4-15-fold). In both liver and kidney, volanesorsen 
accumulation was less than the dose increase. Elimination of volanesorsen from tissue was slow and 
tissue half-life was found to be 25 to 32 days. This is in line with the plasma terminal elimination half-
life, which was 20 to 36 days in monkeys. In humans a similar plasma terminal half-life (~32d) was 
found. Depending on the dose and time of treatment, the monkey liver and kidney tissue 
concentrations were 11- to 53-fold higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax). 
Volanesorsen plasma concentrations did not reveal a gender dependent PK and was highly protein 
bound (>97%). The subcutaneous bioavailability of volanesorsen in healthy humans and monkey was 
high. 
Volanesorsen is not readily transported to the embryo or foetus and poorly secreted into milk. 
Excretion was very slow and the majority of radioactivity was excreted in urine with a minimal amount 
of radioactivity recovered in faeces and with 19% still in tissues and carcass after 56 days. Metabolites 
of volanesorsen were identified in plasma, liver, kidney, urine, and feces samples. The metabolite 
profile generally appeared similar across the investigated species (mouse, rat, monkey, and human). 
Volanesorsen is metabolized initially by endonuclease-mediated hydrolysis at various positions within 
the central gap of the parent compound, followed by subsequent exonuclease (3ʹ and 5ʹ)-mediated 
hydrolysis of the deoxynucleoside-ends of the formed hemimers. The abundance of the metabolites of 
volanesorsen, including the 19-mer, is low in all the matrices investigated as compared to the parent 
molecule. The potential for off-target and/or PD effect is unlikely for shorter nucleotide metabolites due 
to lack of hybridization as well as for longer-nucleotide metabolites because of their low concentration.  
Volanesorsen toxicity in animals is mainly characterized by intrinsic effects of antisense 
oligonucleotides. Adverse effects in the target organs of toxicity, skin, liver, kidney and mandibular and 
mesenteric lymph nodes are identified. Heart is also a target organ for toxicity in rodent and is 
considered treatment related. Complement activation is seen in monkeys, a known effect of antisense 
oligonucleotides and considered species specific. 
Based on the data obtained from the in vivo primary PD studies conducted in different animal models 
of hypertriglyceridemia  suggested that the extent of the decrease in circulating triglycerides induced 
by volanesorsen, is likely dependent on the level of plasma triglycerides at baseline. 
In the rhesus monkey, the decrease in TG following volanesorsen administration was demonstrated in 
hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) animals exclusively. In those animals maintained under fructose diet the 
plasma TG levels (+/- 150-200 mg/dL) were increased at least 3-fold over baseline.   Conversely, in 
the normo-triglyceridemic cynomolgus monkeys repeated sc administration of volanesorsen for 13 or 
39 weeks did not induce a statistically significant change in plasma TG as compared to untreated 
animals (mean plasma TG ~ 40-50 mg/dL). However, the applicant’s claim cannot be confirmed at this 
stage as whether any change in TG levels would have occurred in lean rhesus monkey following 
administration of volanesorsen has not been investigated. 
Cardiac degeneration/inflammation observed in the mouse was considered as a pro-inflammatory 
class-effect of 2’-MOE ASOs in rodents that were considered to be species specific. This was supported 
by the different anatomy of the murine myocardium compared to monkey and the high background 
incidence of cardiomyopathy in mice. Importantly there were no cardiac toxicity findings in the monkey 
following repeated administration of volanesorsen. Moreover, the thorough QT study and the findings 
from the clinical studies do not indicate a possible cardiotoxic effect in humans. 
A decrease in platelet count was noted in all tested animal species and included thrombocytopenia in 
individual monkeys. Low platelet counts in monkeys correlated with bruising and increased APPT and is 
considered a clinically relevant effect as thrombocytopenia was also observed in clinical trials. In a 
Assessment report

subset of monkeys with PLT < 50,000 cells/μL, there was no apparent induction of PLT activation 
makers (CD62P). Furthermore, in vitro PLT activation experiments showed there was no direct 
activation of PLT as determined by CD62P and Pac-1 staining at concentrations 2 to 3-fold greater than 
the plasma Cmax value at 300 mg in humans (4 μM or 28 μg/ml). There was no toxicity to 
hematopoietic organs including bone marrow. Anti-volanesorsen antibodies were measured in the 
majority of animals but were not increased in animals with low platelets. Anti-platelet antibodies were 
not detected in 7 out of 8 affected monkeys. Nevertheless, the applicant considers that clearance of 
platelet is the most likely explanation for the observed thrombocytopenia. In addition, inflammatory 
markers (in particular IL-6 and neutrophil counts) appeared to be increased in several affected 
monkeys, suggesting that the inflammatory response, in part, may drive the observed changes.  
Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Test article-related neoplastic 
findings were above the historical control ranges, and it is likely that the neoplasms are secondary to 
chronic inflammation. However, given the high mortality due to toxicity of volanesorsen, the value of 
these studies is limited. In the rat study, treatment related neoplastic lesions were primarily observed 
as dose dependent increases of masses in the region of the injection site, which corresponded with 
malignant fibrous histiocytoma. These were attributed to inflammatory reactions after repeated SC 
injection, but are not considered to be clinically relevant because malignant fibrous histiocytoma are 
known to occur spontaneously in rats, and rodents are particularly susceptible to the development of 
skin sarcoma after chronic irritation and inflammation.  
Taking into account the lack of a genotoxic effect of volanesorsen and the likelihood that most tumours 
were secondary to chronic inflammation, volanesorsen has little carcinogenic risk for patients, despite 
the early termination of study groups in the mouse and rat study. 
Pups from dams treated with the high dose volanesorsen but not the active ISIS 440670 had reduced 
body weight at birth, which continued to be lower than animals from the other dose groups throughout 
the study duration. The female pups from dams treated with both ASO’s at all doses however, did have 
a delayed vaginal opening indicating delayed sexual maturation. The lower birthweight of the F1 
generation in the 87.5mg/kg/week volanesorsen group was below historical control values. Decreased 
weight was attributed to maternal toxicity. Vaginal opening in treatment groups were within historical 
controls and were likely statistically significant because control group animals fell in the low end of the 
range. Preputial separation in the high dose group falls marginally over the historical control maximum 
value (29.5 days in the 87.5 mg/kg/week group vs 29.1 days. This did not result in adverse effects on 
fertility nor reproductive parameters. There were no effects in mice treated with the murine-specific 
inhibitor, indicating that reducing apoC-III had no untoward effects on foetal development or 
maturation 
Volanesorsen was detected in expressed milk at a concentration of ≤0.6 µg/mL, these concentrations 
are very low (>800 fold lower than effective tissue concentrations in maternal liver). Due to the poor 
oral bioavailability of volanesorsen, it is considered unlikely that these low milk concentrations would 
result in systemic exposure from nursing. 
The calculated PECsurface water for volanesorsen is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and therefore 
volanesorsen is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of volanesorsen alfa have been 
adequately characterised from a non-clinical perspective. 
The main hazard identified in animals is a reduction in platelet count leading to thrombocytopenia, 
which has also been observed in humans in the clinical trials.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 7 clinical studies have been conducted with volanesorsen (50-400 mg) to identify the PK of 
volanesorsen conducted in healthy adults, patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, patients 
with hypertriglyceridemia and patients with diabetes mellitus. A population PK model of volanesorsen 
was developed using the pooled data from 6 of the 7 clinical studies. An exposure-response analysis 
was conducted to characterize the relationship of volanesorsen exposure with efficacy and safety. 
Furthermore, immunogenicity of volanesorsen was evaluated in studies CS2, CS4, CS6, CS7 and CS16. 
Absorption  
The pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen after SC administration were investigated in the single and 
multiple dose ascending study CS1 and are summarised in Table 17 (single dose) and Table 18 
(multiple dose).

Following SC administrationin healthy subjects, volanesorsen was absorbed rapidly into the systemic 
circulation withmedian tmax ranging from 2 to 4 hours. After reaching Cmax, plasma volanesorsen 
concentrations declined in a multi-phasic fashion, with an initial, relatively rapid disposition phase that 
dominated the plasma clearance, followed by a slower elimination phase. The elimination half-life was 
2 to 4 weeks with a half-life of ~2 weeks at the 200 and 400 mg dose. 
The bioavailability of volanesorsen was investigated in study CS13 (Figure 5). The observed 
bioavailability after SC administration is approximately 80% and most likely higher because an AUC of 
0 to 24 hours was used and volanesorsen has a half-life of >2 weeks. 
Figure 5. Mean (± standard deviation) plasma concentration of volanesorsen versus time following 
single SC and IV 300 mg volanesorsen dose (Study CS13). 
Population PK analysis identified SC injection site as a statistically significant covariate influencing the 
bioavailability with a 13% lower bioavailability in the arm compared to abdomen. In addition, SC 
injection in the thigh led to a 12% higher exposure compared to the abdomen. This does not lead to a 
clinically-relevant difference in exposure. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of volanesorsen is ~251 L in healthy subjects and ~300 L in patients with 
familial chylomicronemia syndrome. 
Volanesorsen  has  a  high  plasma  protein  binding  as  determined  by  an  ultrafiltration  method  (study 
304801-IS04). At clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax = ~110 µg/ml and Ctrough,ss is 0.133 µg/ml), 
the plasma protein binding decreases from >99% to 98.0%, indicating that the free fraction increase 
from <1% to 2%.  
The blood-to-plasma ratio of volanesorsen the blood-to-plasma ratio was ~0.56 over a dose range of 
0.05 µg/ml to 5 µg/ml.

Elimination 
The  plasma  elimination  half-life  ranged  from  11.7  days  to  31.2  days  with  shorter  half-lives  observed 
for the 200 and 400 mg dose (study CS1). 
Volanesorsen 
is  metabolised  via  endonuclease  hydrolysis  at  various  positions  within 
the 
deoxyphosphorothioate gap of volanesorsen followed by subsequent 3’- and 5’-exonuclease hydrolysis 
of  the  exposed  deoxynucleoside  ends  of  the 
formed  metabolites.  These  metabolites  are 
pharmacologically  not  active  The  chain-shortened  oligonucleotide  metabolites  of  volanesorsen  are 
mainly excreted in urine, mainly as 7-mer to 5-mer metabolites.  
No human mass balance study was performed due to the long elimination half-life (2 to 4 weeks) and 
the slow excretion of radioactivity in the mass balance studies in animals. For theses reasons absence 
of  a  mass  balance  study  in  humans  is  considered  acceptable.  Following  IV  administration  of 
volanesorsen, urinary excretion of parent compound over a period of 0 to 24 hours is higher compared 
to CS administration (4.6% versus 0.4%) (study CS13). 
Urinary  excretion  of  parent  compound  within  the  first  24  hours  after  a  single  SC  dose  of 
volanesorsonaccounted for less than 1% of administered dose and was generally independent of dose 
level  (studies  CS1  and  CS13).  Urinary  excretion  as  parent  in  the  second  24-hour  interval  (24-48h) 
after a single SC dose was generally lower compared to the first 24 hours (study CS1). Volanesorsen is 
excreted  slowly  in  urine,  <1%  up  to  2.8%  of  the  administered  dose  over  24 hours  post  multiple  SC 
administrations  was  excreted  as  volanesorsen  (study  CS1).  The  urinary  excretion  of  volanesorsen-
equivalent total oligonucleotide over 24 hours post multiple SC administrations of 400 mg amounted to 
16.2 ± 11.7% of the dose. Furthermore, urinary excretion of volanesorsen over a 24-hour interval on 
Day  22  following  multiple  SC  administration  was  higher  than  that  seen  on  Day  1,  likely  due  to 
contributions from preceding doses and ranged from 0.5% to 2.5% of the last dose administered.  
The  renal  clearance  (CLR)  was  2  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  the  apparent  total  body  clearance 
(CL/F). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose  proportionality  was  assessed  on  the  Cmax  and  AUC  after  single-dose  and  repeat-dose 
administration in healthy volunteers (study CS1). The Cmax increased approximately proportionally with 
dose  at  doses  ranging  from  50  to  400  mg  (slope  ranged  from  1.08  to  1.28  using  linear  regression 
analyses  of  the  log-transformed  data)  following  both  single  and  multiple  doses.  The  AUC  values 
increased  slightly  greater  than  proportionally  over  the  same  dose  range  (slope  ranged  from  1.26  to 
1.61). However, the AUC increased nearly dose proportionally in the dose range of 100 to 400 mg on 
Day 22. Furthermore, the half-life of volanesorsen remained constant within the evaluated dose range 
and did not change with repeated dose administration. 
Time dependencies were investigated in healthy volunteers (study CS1, Table 19) and patients (Study 
CS2, Table 20)

Steady state is reached after 13 to 19 weeks once weekly 300 mg volanesorsen SC which results in a 
Ctrough,ss of 127 ng/mL (range of 51.3-195 ng/mL), a Cmax,ss of 8.92 µg/mL (range of 4.9-15.0 µg/ml), 
and an AUC0-τ,ss of 136 µg × h/ml (range of 72.3-236 µg × h/ml). 
Inter- and intrasubject variability 
The predicted inter-individual variability in immunogenicity-negative patients using the population PK 
model and was ~36% for the Cmax,ss and AUC0-168,ss and 58% for the Ctrough,ss. The intra-individual 
variability in immunogenicity-negative patients as estimated by the residual variability from the 
population PK model was 27.9%. Intersubject variability was higher in in immunogenicity-positive 
patients. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen was investigated in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome 
(studies CS2, CS6 and CS7), but also in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (studies CS2 and CS16) 
and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (study CS4). The PK in patients with familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome was reasonably similar to that in healthy volunteers. Also patients with 
high triglyceride without diabetes and patients with high triglyceride and diabetes had a similar PK to 
that in healthy volunteers. 
Plasma trough concentrations of volanesorsen monitored during the treatment and post-treatment 
follow-up period were similar between different patient groups (data not shown). The terminal 
elimination phase following the last SC dose of volanesorsen showed a half-life of ~2 to 5 weeks over 
the dose range studied. Steady-state was approached approximate at the end of the 13-week 
treatment period  with Cmax,ss and AUC0-24,ss values of 7.1 µg/ml and 94 µg*h/ml, respectively (study 
CS2). Ctrough,ss values range are ~150 ng/ml after a dose of 300 mg volanesorsen once weekly. The 
Ctrough,ss for 300 mg biweekly is ~50% less than that for 300 mg once weekly dosing (study CS16 and 
PopPK modelling). 
Special populations 
The  effect  of  weight,  gender,  race,  age  and  impaired  renal  function  on  the  PK  of  volanesorsen  was 
investigated using Population PK (report ISIS304801-PPK01). Furthermore, reduced dose frequency to 
300  mg  bi-weekly  (300  mg  every  two  weeks)  for  patients  experiencing  platelet  decreases  was 
modelled  (report  ISIS304801-PPK01).  The  analysis  dataset  consisted  of  256  subjects  (74  healthy 
volunteers,  41  familial  chylomicronemia  syndrome  patients,  50  high  triglyceridemia  patients  with 
diabetes,  and  91  high  triglyceridemia  patients  without  diabetes)  and  a  total  of  2871  plasma 
concentrations. The model was a 2-compartment, linear model with first order absorption (for SC) and 
first  order  elimination  from  the  central  compartment.  The  Population  PK  model  appears  to  be

sufficiently validated and suitable to predict the effect of age, gender, race, and disease on the PK of 
volanesorsen.  
Impaired renal function 
Renal  function  as  represented  by  baseline  eGFR,  calculated  by  the  MDRD  equation,  was  tested  as  a 
covariate on clearance of volanesorsen in the population PK analysis. Among 256 subjects included in 
the population PK analysis, 137 subjects had normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), while 
112  subjects  fell  in  the  mild  impairment  group  at  Baseline  (eGFR  60  to  <90  mL/min/1.73  m2),  7 
subjects  in  the  moderate  impairment  group  (eGFR  30  to  <60  mL/min/1.73  m2),  and  none  in  the 
severe impairment group.  
Mild to moderate renal impairment had no statistically significant effect on the PK of volanesorsen. The 
effect of severe renal impairment on the PK of volanesorsen was not investigated, but is not expected 
to affect the PK of volanesorsen. 
The  limited  number  of  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  is  because  they  were 
excluded  from  the  studies  per  the  protocol  exclusion  criteria  (creatinine  clearance  calculated  by 
Cockcroft-Gault formula <50 or 60 ml/min).  
Impaired hepatic function 
No subjects with hepatic impairment were included in the PK studies of volanesorsen. However, no 
effect on the PK is expected from a decreased hepatic function, since volanesorsen is mainly 
metabolised by tissue nucleases. 
Gender 
Of the 256 subjects included in the population PK analysis, 166 were male and 90 were female. Sex 
has no statistically significant effect on the clearance of volanesorsen (clearance was 9.4% higher in 
males compared to females). 
Race 
Among the 256 subjects included in the population PK analysis, 202 patients were Caucasian, 37 were 
Black, 13 were Asian, and 4 were Other. Race was determined to have no statistically significant effect 
on  the  clearance  of  volanesorsen  (clearance  was  13%  lower  in  African-American  and  1.3%  lower  in 
Asians). 
Body weight 
The  effect  of  weight  on  the  PK  of  volanesorsen  was  investigated  over  a  range  of  37  to  140  kg.  No 
clinically significant effect  was observed on the PK of volanesorsen over this  weight range; the Cmax 
and AUC were 16 %and 12% higher in the 37 to 76 kg body weight group and 10%to 8% lower in the 
94 to 140 kg body weight group compared to the 76 to 94 kg body weight group, respectively. 
Age 
A total of 25 patients ≥65 years of age were treated with volanesorsen. No clinically significant effect 
on the pharmacokienics was observed for patients aged ≥65 years of age versus patients <65 years of 
age. Limited information on the pharmacokinetics is available for subjects >75 years (N=2), but the 
pharmacokinetics appears similar compared to subjects <65 years of age. 
Bi-weekly dosing regimen 
Reduced dose frequency to 300 mg biweekly (300 mg every two weeks) was modelled to help patients 
experiencing  platelet  decreases  to  retain  these  patients  on  volanesorsen.  Ctrough  after  1  year  reduced 
from 127 ng/ml (51.3-295 ng/ml) when dosed once weekly to 58.0 n/ml (23.1-137 ng/ml) when dosed 
Assessment report

biweekly. The simulated steady-state Ctrough after once weekly dosing was in good agreement with the 
observed Week 13 mean steady-state Ctrough of 119 ng/ml in FCS patients (study CS6).  
Immunogenicity 
Antibodies to volanesorsen were formed in 30% of the patients with familial chylomicronemia 
syndrome treated with volanesorsen (study CS6). In the other studies, the formation of anti-drug 
antibodies ranged from 16% to 40% (studies CS2, CS4, and CS16). The formation of the antibodies 
was characterised by a late onset (median onset was 6 months) and low antibody titres. Once formed 
the anti-drug antibodies were generally sustained. No consistent trend between duration of treatment, 
dose level and immunogenicity incidence was identified. The presence of anti-drug antibodies increased 
Ctrough levels of volanesorsen up to 19-fold (ranges from 2-fold to 19-fold).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Volanesorsen is not a substrate of CYP enzymes or drug transporters in in vitro studies.  
Volanesorsen  at  a  range  of  0.1-100  µM  was  investigated  as  a  CYP  inhibitor  (study  304801-IS07)  or 
CYP  inducer  (study  304801-IS06).      At  these  concentrations,  it  did  not  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 nor did it  cause induce  CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or 
CYP3A4 at either the mRNA level or enzyme activity level. 
Study  304801-IS05  investigated  the  potential  of  volanesorsen  to  act  as  an  inhibitor  of  various  drug 
transporters, and was found not to inhibit BCRP, P-glycoprotein, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations (1.6 µM). 
The  population  PK  analysis  showed  that  co-administration  with  fibrates,  other  lipid  modifying  agents, 
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or platelet aggregation inhibitors (excluding heparin) did not result in a 
clinically-relevant alteration in the PK of volanesorsen.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Volanesorsen  is  a  2′-O-2-methoxyethyl  (2′-MOE)  antisense  oligonucleotide  (ASO)  inhibitor  of  the 
molecular target apoC-III, a key regulator of TG metabolism. 
Antisense  technology  interrupts  the  protein  production  process  by  degrading  the  target  messenger 
ribonucleic  acid  (mRNA)  and  thus  reducing  the  translation  of  the  specific  protein.  Antisense  inhibitors 
(ASOs) are designed to be sequence specific with a high binding affinity to their unique target mRNA. 
Volanesorsen is designed to bind to a specific segment within the 3′-untranslated region of the human 
apoC-III mRNA and promote a reduction in apoC-III protein.  
Initially,  apoC-III  was  believed  to  regulate  plasma  TG  levels  through  inhibition  of  LPL  activity. 
However,  since  volanesorsen  therapy  also  reduced  TG  in  subjects  who  genetically  lack  any  functional 
LPL  activity,  ApoC-III  also  regulates  TG  levels  through  non-LPL  mediated  pathways,  specifically, 
through  inhibition  of  hepatic  receptor-mediated  clearance  pathways  mediated  by  the  low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) receptors 
(Figure 6).

Abbreviations:  ApoC-III = apolipoprotein C-III; CR = chylomicron remnant; HL = hepatic lipase; 
IDL=intermediate-density lipoprotein; LCAT = lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; 
LDLR = LDL receptor; LPL = lipoprotein lipase; LRP1 = low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; 
SDC1 = syndecan 1; VLDL = very low-density lipoprotein. 
FCS is primarily a consequence of impaired triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) clearance, manifested by 
the  severe  elevation  in  plasma  TG,  chylomicrons,  and/or  very  low-density lipoproteins  (VLDL).  Levels 
of  the  apoC-III  protein,  which  reside  on  the  surface  of  apoB  containing  lipoproteins  and  high  density 
lipoproteins, are elevated in patients with FCS and the majority of apoC-III is associated with TG-rich 
lipoproteins (TLRs) in these patients. Volanesorsen therapy causes suppression of the ApoC-III protein, 
which leads to reductions in plasma TG in FCS patients. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Healthy subject pharmacodynamics in a single- and multiple-ascending dose study 
The proof-of concept first in human study (study CS1) was conducted in 33 healthy subjects.  
Volanesorsen administered by SC injection on alternate days during the first week (Days 1, 3 and 5) 
and then once-weekly for the next 3 weeks (Days 8, 15 and 22), resulted in dose-dependent 
substantial reductions in ApoC-III of 20%, 17%, 71%, and 78% on Day 29, 1 week after the last dose, 
at doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg, respectively , which was associated with dose-dependent 
reductions in TG of 20%, 25%, 43%, and 44%, respectively (Figure 7).

An apparent exposure-response relationship with respect the plasma trough concentration (expected to 
be in equilibrium with target tissue exposure) and apoC-III level was described with an inhibitory effect 
Emax model (Figure 8). The model-estimated plasma trough concentration that produced 50% of 
maximum drug-induced inhibitory effect (IC50) for apoC-III was 39.9 ng/mL.  
Figure 8. Relationship between Volanesorsen Plasma Trough Concentrations and ApoC-III on Day 29

Exposure-response relationship in phase 2 
In the phase 2 study CS2, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled dose response study, the 
PK/PD relationship of 100, 200, and 300 mg volanesorsen administered weekly has clearly been 
demonstrated. Plasma trough concentrations were dose-dependent and increased gradually with time, 
achieving steady state at 13 weeks (Figure 9).  
Figure 9. Mean (± Standard Error) Plasma Trough and Post-Treatment Concentrations of 
Volanesorsen in Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia following Once-Weekly Subcutaneous 
Administration for 13 Weeks in Study CS2 
At the end of 13 weeks treatment, plasma concentrations of volanesorsen decreased slowly with a half-
life of ~2 to 5 weeks, which was independent of the dose. Volanesorsen monotherapy was associated 
with dose dependent reductions in apoC-III of -40%, -64%, and -80% (Figure 10) and TG reductions 
of -31%, -58%, and -71% Figure 11) at doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg, respectively. The plasma 
trough concentrations at steady-state, a surrogate of target tissue exposure, were positively correlated 
with these dose-dependent reductions in ApoC-III and TG (Figure 12). Highest levels of ApoC-III and 
TG reduction were achieved with the 300 mg volanesorsen dose. 
The exposure-response relationship was further evaluated using an inhibitory effect Emax model. The 
model-estimated plasma IC50 were 36.3 and 44.5 ng/ml for the ApoC-III and TG respectively.

Exposure-response relationship in phase 3 
Similar exposure-response relationships as compared with the phase study CS2 were observed in the 
the two phase 3 studies, i.e study CS6 conducted in patients with FCS and in study CS16 conducted in 
patients with hypertriglyceridemia. For each of studies CS6 and CS16, time-matched Ctrough and apoC-
III and TG data at Months 3, 6, and 12 in immunogenicity-negative patients were pooled and fit to an 
inhibitory effect Emax model assuming a complete inhibition of apoC-III and TG at infinite Ctrough as was 
done for Phase 1 and 2 studies.  The model-estimated plasma IC50 values were 21.0 ng/mL (study 
CS16) and 23.0 ng/mL (study CS6) for apoC-III and 26.6 ng/mL (study CS16) and 47.3 ng/mL (study 
CS6) for TG (Figure 13).

PK/PD modelling 
The exposure-TG response relationship was further characterized using population PK model-predicted 
Ctrough values and observed TG responses in individual FCS patients in study CS6. The results of the % 
change in TG vs. Ctrough analysis at Month 3 show that all four Ctrough quartiles of volanesorsen achieve 
a mean reduction of 65-75% from Baseline, indicating a robust TG response across the range of 
exposure resulting from the 300 mg weekly dose. 
Immunogenicity 
In the phase 3 study CS6, of the 33 volanesorsen-treated patients, 10 (30%) patients tested positive 
for ADA during the study (vs 3% in placebo). ADA-positive patients in the volanesorsen group had 
similar TG reduction (-75.6% at Month 3, -69.1% at Month 6 and -39.2% at Month 12) as those who 
remained ADA-negative (-70.2% at Month 3, -58.6% at Month 6 and -50.3% at Month 12). 
In the phase 3 study CS16, of the 75 volanesorsen-treated patients, 12 (16%) patients tested positive 
for ADA during the study (vs 5 in placebo). Similarly, ADA-positive patients in the volanesorsen group

had similar TG reduction (-73.0% at Month 3, -57.7% at Month 6) as those who remained 
ADA-negative (-72.7% at Month 3, -68.6% at Month 6). 
The formation of the antibodies was characterised by a late onset (median onset was 6 months) and 
low antibody titres. Once formed the anti-drug antibodies were generally sustained. No consistent 
trend between duration of treatment, dose level and immunogenicity incidence was identified. The 
presence of anti-drug antibodies increased Ctrough levels of volanesorsen up to 19-fold (ranges from 2-
fold to 19-fold), but did not affect the terminal elimination half-life (studies CS6 and CS16). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Following subcutaneous injection, peak plasma concentrations of volanesorsen are typically reached in 
2 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of volanesorsen following a single subcutaneous 
administration is approximately 80% (most likely higher because an AUC of 0 to 24 hours was used 
and volanesorsen has a half-life of >2 weeks). 
Following a dose of 300 mg once weekly in patients with FCS, the estimated geometric mean 
(coefficient of variation % of geometric mean) steady-state Cmax is 8.92 µg/ml (35%), AUC0-168h is 136 
µg*h/ml (38%), and Ctrough is 127 ng/ml (58%) in patients who remain negative for anti-drug 
antibody. An alternative dosing regimen of 300 mg volanesorsen every two weeks results in a Ctrough,ss 
of approximately 58.0 ng/ml with Cmax and AUC similar compared to the once weekly dosing regimen. 
Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen in healthy volunteers and patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia have shown that the Cmax of volanesorsen is dose-proportional over a dose range 
of 100 to 400 mg and the AUC is slightly more than dose-proportional over the same dose range. 
Steady-state was reached approximately 3 months after starting volanesorsen. Accumulation in Ctrough 
was observed (7- to 14-fold) and little or no increase in Cmax or AUC was observed following weekly SC 
administration over a dose of 200 to 400 mg. Volanesorsen was rapidly and widely distributed to 
tissues following subcutaneous or intravenous administration. The estimated steady-state volume of 
distribution (Vss) in patients with FCS is 330 L. Volanesorsen is highly bound to human plasma proteins 
(>98%) and the binding is concentration independent. 
Elimination involves both metabolism in tissues and excretion in urine. Urinary recovery of the parent 
drug was limited in humans with < 3% of administered subcutaneous dose recovered within 24 hours 
post dose. The parent drug and 5- to 7-mer chain-shortened metabolites accounted for approximately 
26%  and  55%  of  oligonucleotides  recovered  in  urine,  respectively.  Following  subcutaneous 
administration, terminal elimination half-life is approximately 2 to 5 weeks. 
In vitro studies show that volanesorsen is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), bile 
salt export pump (BSEP), organic cation transporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporters 
(OAT1, OAT3). 
Volanesorsen is not a substrate for CYP metabolism, and is metabolised in tissues by endonucleases to 
form shorter oligonucleotides that are then substrates for additional metabolism by exonucleases. 
Unchanged volanesorsen is the predominant circulating component. 
In vitro studies indicate that volanesorsen is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. 
Taking  into  account  the  in  vitro  study  results,  the  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions  with 
volanesorsen  was  considered  low  and  therefore  the  lack  of  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  was 
acceptable.

Special Populations 
Renal impairment 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that mild and moderate renal impairment has no 
clinically relevant effect on the systemic exposure of volanesorsen. The effect of severe renal 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen was not investigated, but is not expected to 
affect the PK of volanesorsen. Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of volanesorsen in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown. However, no 
effect on the PK is expected from a decreased hepatic function, since volanesorsen is mainly 
metabolised by tissue nucleases. 
Age, sex, weight, and race 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, sex, or race has no clinically 
relevant effect on volanesorsen exposure. There are limited data available in subjects >75 years of 
age. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit the formation of apoC-III, a protein 
that is recognised to regulate both triglyceride metabolism and hepatic clearance of chylomicrons and 
other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The selective binding of volanesorsen to the apoC-III messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) within the 3′ untranslated region at base position 489-508 causes the 
degradation of the mRNA. This binding prevents translation of the protein apoC-III, thus removing an 
inhibitor of triglyceride clearance and enabling metabolism through an LPL-independent pathway. 
The proof of concept study for volanesorsen showed that the dose response for decrease in ApoC-III 
over time correlated well with the dose responses for a decrease in TG. Furthermore, these reductions 
gradually returned to baseline after the last dose, consistent with the long terminal elimination half-life 
of volanesorsen (~2-5 weeks). 
Furthermore, results from the PK/PD model support the clinical use of the proposed 300 mg 
volanesorsen once weekly dosing regimen. Modelling and simulation results are supportive of starting 
with a lower dose with option to increase the dose particularly for patients of >70kg who are 
underexposed to the drug and are at lower risk of experiencing thrombocytopenia based on modelling 
and simulation results. 
Relatively high incidences in anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed in the phase 3 studies.  The 
presence of anti-drug antibodies increased Ctrough levels of volanesorsen up to 19-fold (ranges from 2-
fold to 19-fold), however, the presence of antibodiesdid not seem to affect the efficacy of volanesorsen 
since approximately similar reductions in TG in ADA-positive and ADA-negative were found. 
The formation of binding antibodies to volanesorsen appeared to increase total Ctrough by 2- to 19-fold. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of volanesorsen is considered to have been adequately characterised from 
the submitted data and no additional measures are considered necessary.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study  CS2  was  a  phase  2,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  dose  response  study  of 
volanesorsen  administered  SC  weekly  for  13  weeks  in  subjects  with  severe  or  uncontrolled 
hypertriglyceridemia. 
 Study CS2 consisted of 4 patient groups in three treatment arms: 
- 
In  the  monotherapy  arm  (n=57),  groups  1  and  2  received  volanesorsen  as  monotherapy  and 
were randomized to 3 dose cohorts (100, 200, or 300 mg) or placebo with group 2 consisting 
of a PK group.  
- 
In  the  fibrate  combination  arm  (group  3;  n=  28)  patients  on  a  stable  dose  of  fibrate  were 
randomized to 2 dose cohorts (200 or 300 mg) or placebo 
- 
In the FCS arm (group 4), all three FCS patients received 300 mg volanesorsen open-label 
The primary objective was to evaluate the dose/response pharmacodynamic effects versus placebo on 
mean  percent  change  from  baseline  in  fasting  total  apoC-III  levels  with  the  primary  analysis  taking 
place after all patients in group 1 and 2 completed the Day 92 visit (week 13). Secondary objectives 
were  comprised  of  PD  effect  on  fasting  ApoC-III  associated  with  a  variety  of  lipid  parameters,  PD 
effects over time, safety, tolerability and PK evaluation.  
Pharmacodynamic results from this study are summarised in Table 21 and individual patient 
responses in Figure 14.

Figure 14. Waterfall Plot of Individual Patient TG Response to Volanesorsen Treatment by Dose in 
Study CS2 
The  reductions  observed  in  the  different  groups  were  sustained  for  2  to  6  weeks  after  the  last  dose, 
consistent with the drug’s long terminal elimination half-life. Exploratory PK/PD analysis showed good 
correlation between the plasma volanesorsen trough concentrations at steady-state and serum apoC-
III protein and TG levels in all patient groups studied.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of volanesorsen (300 mg once weekly) 
as compared to placebo on the percent change in fasting TG from Baseline to Month 3 in patients with 
FCS. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of volanesorsen as compared to 
placebo on the following: 
• Postprandial TG change from Baseline 
• Absolute change from Baseline in fasting TG 
• Proportion of patients who achieve fasting TG < 750 mg/dL 
•  Proportion of patients who achieve ≥  40% fasting TG reduction from Baseline 
• Patient reported abdominal pain 
o Frequency 
o Severity 
• Composite of episodes of acute pancreatitis and patient-reported abdominal pain 
• Change from Baseline in hepatosplenomegaly as assessed by MRI 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the percentage change in fasting TG from Baseline to the primary analysis 
time point at the end of Month 3, where the value was defined as the average of Week 12 (Day 78) 
and Week 13 (Day 85) fasting assessments. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were rank prioritized and tested according to position in the hierarchy using a 
sequential closed testing procedure:

1. Treatment response rate, where a patient with fasting plasma TG < 750 mg/dL at the primary 
analysis time point (3 months) was defined as a responder. Only the subset of patients with baseline 
fasting plasma TG ≥  750 mg/dL was included in this population 
2. Percent change from baseline to the 6-month time point in fasting TG 
3. Percent change from baseline to the 12-month time point in fasting TG 
4. Average of maximum intensity of patient reported abdominal pain during the treatment period 
5. Postprandial TG area under the curve (AUC)(0-9h) change from Baseline to on-treatment measures 
(between Week 13 and Week 19) 
6. Treatment response rate, where a patient who achieves fasting TG ≥  40% reduction from Baseline 
at the primary analysis time point is defined as a responder 
7. Absolute change from Baseline to the primary analysis time point in fasting TG 
8. Frequency of composite of episodes of acute pancreatitis and patient reported abdominal pain 
during the treatment period 
9. Change from Baseline in hepatic volume as assessed by MRI at Week 52 
Exploratory endpoints included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Percent change from baseline in fasting apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48) and chylomicron TG as 
measured in the primary analysis time point 
Percent change from baseline in postprandial apoB-48 and chylomicron TG 
Percent change from baseline in fasting apoC-III as measured in the primary analysis time 
point 
Percent change from baseline in other fasting lipid measurements, including non-HDL-C, apoB, 
HDL-C, apoA-1, VLDL-C and LDL-C 
Sample size 
Based upon prior clinical trial experience with volanesorsen, it is estimated that the standard deviation 
of the percent change in total TG is approximately 46%. With 22 volanesorsen 300 mg once-weekly 
patients and 22 placebo patients there would be approximately 80% power to detect a 50% difference 
in TG levels between treatment groups at an alpha level of 0.01, assuming 60% reduction in the 
volanesorsen treatment patients and 10% reduction in the placebo patients. Approximately 70 patients 
will be randomized and dosed in this study. 
Randomisation 
Using an Interactive Voice/Web-Response System (IXRS), eligible, consenting patients were 
randomized 1:1 to receive volanesorsen or placebo and stratified for: 
• Prior history of pancreatitis vs. no history of pancreatitis 
• Receiving concurrent fibrate and/or prescription omega-3 fatty acid vs. not receiving these drugs 
History of pancreatitis was defined as a documented diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or hospitalization 
for severe abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis and for which no alternate diagnosis was 
made.

A permuted block schedule was used. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Placebo and active drug infusions were visually and physiological 
indistinguishable. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the percent change from baseline to the primary 
analysis time point in fasting TG between ISIS 304801 300 mg once weekly group and placebo group 
in  the  Full  Analysis  Set.  The  data  are  analyzed  using  an  ANCOVA  model  with  the  two  randomization 
stratification factors (presence or absence of pancreatitis; presence or absence of concurrent omega-3 
fatty acids and/or fibrates and T2DM status and log-transformed baseline TG as covariates.  
A  responder  analysis  was  performed  as  the  key  sensitivity  analysis.  The  responder  analysis  was  the 
comparison of proportion of patients that achieved ≥ 40% reduction in triglyceride from baseline to the 
primary  analysis  time  point  between  the  2  groups.  The  data  are  analysed  using  a  logistic  regression 
model  with  the  two  randomization  stratification  factors  and  log-transformed  baseline  triglyceride  as 
covariates.  In  order  to  examine  whether  the  response  is  consistent  over  a  range  of  response 
thresholds, responder analysis with a series of response thresholds (50%, 60%, 70% reduction) is also 
conducted. 
The primary analysis time point is at the end of Month 3 where the value is defined as the average of 
Week 12 (Day 78) and Week 13 (Day 85) fasting assessments. The Month 6 analysis time point is at 
the end of Month 6 where the values defined as the average of Week 25 (Day 169) and Week 26 (Day 
176)  fasting  assessments.  The  Month  12  analysis  time  point  is  at  the  end  of  Month  12  where  the 
values  defined  as  the  average  of  Week  50  (Day  344)  /  Week  51  (Day  351)  and  Week  52  (Day  358) 
fasting assessments. 
The baseline for fasting lipid measurements was defined as the average of Day 1 pre-dose assessment 
and the last measurement prior to Day 1. The baseline for other measurements is defined as the last 
non-missing assessment prior to the first dose of Study Drug. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for sensitivity analysis, and 
the treatment effect will be estimated using Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was also analysed using the nonparametric Wei-Johnson method for sensitivity analysis. 
Patients  with  a  missing  primary  endpoint  have  TG  value  multiply  imputed  using  an  imputation  model 
that  contains  the  following  variables:  baseline  TG,  TG  values  at  post-baseline  visits  and  the  2 
stratification factors, and the multiple imputation will be stratified by treatment (Schafer 1997; Schafer 
1999).  Any  patient  who  discontinued  early  from  the  Treatment  Period  was  strongly  encouraged  to 
attend applicable landmark visits including Week 4, Week 8, Weeks 12 and 13 during which  TG were 
collected and used in the primary analysis. The multiple imputations method was not implemented in 
the primary analysis since there was no missing TG value at the primary endpoint. Missing data were 
imputed according to protocol for the Months 6 and 12 analyses.

Numbers analysed 
All 66 patients took at least 1 dose of study drug and had a baseline TG assessment and therefore 
were included in the safety set and the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
The Per Protocol Set, which excluded patients with protocol deviations that would be expected to affect 
efficacy and PD assessments, was comprised of 31 (93%) patients in the volanesorsen group and 31 
(91%) patients in the placebo group. Four patients, in whom a pathogenic mutation in a type-1 gene 
was not identified, entered the study based on low LPL activity. Subsequently, the laboratory data for 
two of these patients could not be verified and although these were not considered protocol deviations 
(i.e. they were not due to patient or investigator action or error), the data from these 2 patients were 
excluded from the PPS analysis. The other two patients were excluded from the PPS due to ineligible 
LPL activity results because a pre-heparin sample was used for LPL activity analysis. These were 
considered major protocol violations.  
The PK population used for the assessment of plasma volanesorsen concentration comprised all 33 
(100%) patients who were randomized to receive volanesorsen. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Treatment  with  volanesorsen  300  mg  weekly  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in 
triglyceride levels in patients with FCS at Month 3 (primary endpoint) (Table 25). Results for change 
in triglyceride levels are also presented for months 6 and 12.

c The LS means, confidence intervals, and p-values were from an ANCOVA model with percent change from Baseline 
as the dependent variable, presence of pancreatitis and presence of concurrent omega-3 fatty acids and/or fibrates, 
and treatment group as factors, and log-transformed baseline as a covariate based on observed data  
Individual patient responses are presented in Figure 16.

Secondary endpoints 
Treatment response analysis was performed (Table 26) with, a responder defined as a patient  with 
fasting plasma TG < 750 mg/dL at the primary analysis time point (3 months) .  
The threshold of TG < 750 mg/dL was chosen as at this point chylomicron accumulation becomes 
significant and is widely considered to present a threshold above the risk of pancreatitis is increased.

During treatment, 15 (46%) patients in the volanesorsen group and 14 (42%) patients in the placebo 
group reported abdominal pain (Table 27).

Effect  on  frequency  of  composite  episodes  of  acute  pancreatitis  and  patient  reported  abdominal  pain 
during the on-treatment period 
Twelve  (36%)  patients  in  the  volanesorsen  group  and  13  (39%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had 
adjudicated  acute  pancreatitis  and/or  moderate/severe  abdominal  pain  on  treatment.  Review  of  the 
per-patient  per  year  incidence  of  episodes  of  acute  pancreatitis  and/or  reported  moderate/severe 
abdominal pain did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the volanesorsen (2.73) 
and placebo groups (2.04) (p = 0.6131). 
Effect on acute pancreatitis events (exploratory endpoints)  
Prior  to  study  treatment,  13  (39%)  patients  in  the  volanesorsen  group  experienced  30  adjudicated 
pancreatitis  events  and  10  (30%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  23  such  events.  On 
treatment, 1 (3%) volanesorsen-treated patient suffered 1 event of pancreatitis and 3 (9%) placebo-
treated  patients  suffered  4  events  of  pancreatitis  (p=0.6132).  Review  of  the  per  patient  per  year 
incidence  of  pancreatitis  events  did  not  show  statistically  significant  differences  between  the 
volanesorsen and placebo groups, but the study was not powered for this analysis. 
An analysis of patients with a history of recurrent pancreatitis events ≥ 2 events in the 5 years prior to 
Study Day 1) was performed to focus on higher risk patients who might have a detectable difference in 
event  rate.  The  results  of  this  analysis  showed  a  significant  reduction  in  pancreatitis  attacks  in 
volanesorsen-treated  patients  compared  to  placebo treated  patients  (p=0.0242).  In  the  volanesorsen

group, of the 7 patients who had 24 adjudicated pancreatitis attacks in the prior 5 years, none of the 
patients experienced a pancreatitis attack during the 52 week treatment period. In the placebo group, 
of  the  4  patients  who  had  17  adjudicated  pancreatitis  attacks  in  the  prior  5  years,  3  patients 
experienced 4 pancreatitis attacks during the 52-week treatment period.

Effect on acute pancreatitis events (exploratory endpoints)  
Prior  to  study  treatment,  13  (39%)  patients  in  the  volanesorsen  group  experienced  30  adjudicated 
pancreatitis  events  and  10  (30%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  23  such  events.  On 
treatment, 1 (3%) volanesorsen-treated patient suffered 1 event of pancreatitis and 3 (9%) placebo-
treated  patients  suffered  4  events  of  pancreatitis  (p=0.6132).  Review  of  the  per  patient  per  year 
incidence  of  pancreatitis  events  did  not  show  statistically  significant  differences  between  the 
volanesorsen and placebo groups,  
An analysis of patients with a history of recurrent pancreatitis events (≥ 2 events in the 5 years prior 
to Study Day 1) was performed to focus on higher risk patients who might have a detectable difference 
in  event  rate.  The  results  of  this  analysis  showed  a  significant  reduction  in  pancreatitis  attacks  in 
volanesorsen-treated  patients  compared  to  placebo treated  patients  (p=0.0242).  In  the  volanesorsen 
group, of the 7 patients who had 24 adjudicated pancreatitis attacks in the prior 5 years, none of the 
patients experienced a pancreatitis attack during the 52 week treatment period. In the placebo group, 
of  the  4  patients  who  had  17  adjudicated  pancreatitis  attacks  in  the  prior  5  years,  3  patients 
experienced 4 pancreatitis attacks during the 52-week treatment period.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Clinical studies included 4 patients with FCS aged 65 or over  treated with volanesorsen in randomised 
control studies (phase II study CS2, 1 patient; CS6 3 patients), and 6 patients aged 65 and over in the 
open-label extension study (CS7). No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed 
between these patients and younger patients, however data are limited in this subpopulation. 
Supportive studies 
Study CS16, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study of volanesorsen 
administered subcutaneously to patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Patients were included in the study 
if they had fasting TG≥500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L) at Screening. The study design was similar to that of 
CS6, but the treatment period was limited to 26 instead of 52 weeks. Actions to be taken in patients 
with low platelet counts were the same as in study CS6. In study CS16, even though the target 
population was patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, based on Amendment 2, 7 patients with 
documented FCS were also enrolled in study CS16. 
A total of 114 patients were enrolled for a 26-week treatment period with the dose frequency reduced 
to  300  mg  every  2  weeks  after  13  weeks  of  treatment  (exemptions  were  given  to  patients  who 
completed ≥ 5 months of treatment as of 27 May 2016) per a protocol amendment. 
A  total  of  39  patients  were  switched  to  every  2  weeks  treatment  due  to  Protocol  Amendment  4  (14 
volanesorsen  treated  and  5  placebo  patients  at  Week  13  and  12  volanesorsen-treated  and  8  placebo 
patients at various timepoints after Week 13 up to and including Week 21). Three additional patients 
dose  adjusted  during  the  study  (2  for  AEs  and  1  for  platelet  count).  An  additional  8  patients  were 
assigned to the biweekly dose group because they missed 4 or more doses in the last 3 months of the 
treatment  period,  including  those  who  discontinued  early  and  did  not  meet  the  minimum  dose 
requirement  for  the  weekly  group.  Baseline  charactersitcs  of  the  patients  included  in  this  study  are 
summarsied in Table 30.

One  of  the  randomized  patients  was  discontinued  prior  to  treatment  for  failure  to  meet  the  eligibility 
criteria and thus is only included in the volanesorsen ‘total’ and ‘all patients’ group. Overall, 29 (25%) 
of  the  113  patients  were  reported  to  have  prematurely  discontinued  from  study  treatment;  no  FCS 
patients discontinued from treatment prematurely. Across treatment groups, 11% of placebo patients 
and 33% of patients treated with volanesorsen discontinued treatment prematurely. The most common 
reason  for  discontinuation  of  treatment  was  AE  or  SAE  (20%  in  the  volanesorsen  group  (n=15)  and 
8%  in  the  placebo  group  (n=3).  The  majority  (33%)  of  the  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were 
adverse  events  at  the  injection  site.  There  were  no  deaths  reported  during  the  study.  Of  the  113 
treated  patients,  74.6%  patients  completed  the  study  drug  treatment  (67.1%  and  89.5%  of  the 
volanesorsen  and  placebo  group,  respectively).  Ninety-eight  percent  of  patients  entered  the  post-

treatment  follow-up  period  at  the  end  of  study.  Sixteen  (14%)  of  the  patients  on  post-treatment 
follow-up  were  terminated  early  with  the  most  common  reason  for  early  termination  being  voluntary 
withdrawal  (8%).  Other  reasons  for  early  termination  of  the  post-treatment  follow-up  were  AE  (2%), 
enrollment in the open label extension (1%), and other (4%). 
Treatment  with  volanesorsen  300  mg  weekly  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  TG 
levels in  both  patients  with  severe  hypertriglyceridemia  (SHTG)  and  in  patients  with  FCS  at  Month 3. 
Weekly  treatment  with  volanesorsen  decreased  TG  levels  with  -72.1%  (absolute  TG  reduction  of  889 
mg/dL)  compared to  a  -2.9%  change  in  the  placebo  group;  this 69%  difference  between  groups  was 
statistically  significant  (p  <  0.0001).  In  the  FCS  patients,  volanesorsen  300  mg  weekly  resulted  in  a 
mean absolute reduction of 1511 mg/dL, which correlates to a reduction of -73% from baseline after 3 
Months of treatment, compared with a mean increase of 70% in placebo-treated FCS patients (N=2).  
At the end of the 26-week treatment period, 35% of the patients receiving volanesorsen had the dose 
reduced  to  300  mg  every  2  weeks.  The  dose  reduced  patients  had  a  62%  reduction  in  TGs  and  the 
weekly patients had a 78% reduction from baseline, both statistically significant (p<0.0001).  
The primary objective of the open-label extension study CS7 was to further evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of dosing and extended dosing with volanesorsen in patients with FCS. Three patient groups 
were enrolled:  
Group 1: FCS patients rolling over from study CS6 (index study) 
Group 2: FCS patients rolling over from study CS16 (index study) 
Group 3: FCS patients who did not participate in either the CS6 or CS16 index studies. 
For patients in Group 3, inclusion criteria were similar to those of study CS6. The study design is 
presented in Figure 18.  
Figure 18. Study design and treatment schema of study CS7 
In study CS7, all patients were to have the dose frequency reduced to 300 mg every 2 weeks after 13 
weeks  of  treatment  in  advance  (exceptions  were  given  to  patients  who  completed  ≥ 5 months  of 
dosing as of 27 May 2016) per Amendment 4 of the protocol dated 06 June 2016. The primary efficacy 
endpoints of study CS7 are summarized below:

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CS2, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 13-week dose response study 
conducted in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, was initiated based on the results of the proof-
of-concept first-in-human study CS1. Study CS2 consisted of 4 cohorts in three treatment arms 
(monotherapy, concomitant fibrate therapy and patient with FCS) in which several doses of 
volanesorsen have been investigated; In the monotherapy arm (n=57), volanesorsen was investigated 
at doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg once weekly, in the fibrate arm (n=28) at doses of 200 and 300 mg 
once weekly and in the FCS arm (n=3) at the dose of 300 mg once weekly.  The overall design and 
duration of study was considered acceptable for a dose finding study. 
The applicant has conducted several studies in different types of patients, i.e. patients with FCS and 
patients with (severe) hypertriglyceridemia. The primary efficacy data obtained in the proposed target 
population are derived from the pivotal phase 3 study CS6, a placebo-controlled, 52-week study in 
patients with FCS. Additional data come from the phase 3 study (CS16) in (severe) 
hypertriglyceridemia, and an ongoing open label extension study of 52 weeks (CS7) in which FCS 
patients could be included from study CS6 and CS16 or treatment naïve FCS patients.   
General inclusion/exclusion criteria of study CS6 and CS7 seem appropriate for the claimed indication 
of FCS.  
The double-blind treatment period of 52 weeks in the pivotal Study CS6 in FCS patients is provides the 
pivotal data to evaluate efficacy, although the ongoing open-label extension Study CS7 with a 
treatment duration of at least 52 weeks may provide more insight on the long term efficacy of 
volanesorsen. The treatment duration of 26 weeks in Study CS16 is sufficient to provide supportive 
efficacy data in in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, although the treatment period may be considered 
minimal considering that steady state has only been reached after 13 weeks of therapy. A follow-up 
period of 13 weeks off-treatment of Study CS6 can be considered appropriate for information on the 
maintenance of the effect and the safety of volanesorsen. 
Initially, volanesorsen was to be administered once weekly for each individual patient in the phase 3 
studies. Due to two serious adverse events of thrombocytopenia observed in Study CS6, a dosing 
algorithm based on platelet counts has been implemented in the protocols of all phase 3 studies. 
According to the dosing algorithm, dose adjustments to 300 mg every 2 weeks or dose interruptions 
can be implemented for patients experiencing platelet decrease in order to reduce the risk of 
progression to more severe thrombocytopenia. In Study CS6, all dose adjustments, if necessary, 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 79/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred after month 3, whereas in Study CS16, all patients were to have the dose frequency reduced 
to 300 mg every 2 weeks after 13 weeks of treatment in advance (exceptions were given to patients 
who completed ≥ 5 months of dosing as of 27 May 2016).  
The primary objective of the phase 3 studies was to establish the effect of volanesorsen on reduction 
of TG levels. The primary endpoint was therefore chosen as the percentage change in fasting TG from 
baseline to the primary analysis time point at the end of month 3, where the value was defined as the 
average of Week 12 (Day 78) and Week 13 (Day 85) fasting assessments. This is considered 
appropriate to establish the initial TG lowering effect and can be considered sufficiently long given that 
steady state of Ctrough of volanesorsen is reached at that time period and maximum reductions in ApoC-
III and TG may be expected at this time point. However, for maintenance of effect change in TG (full 
analysis set) at 6 and 12 months are also considered important, while long-term maintenance of effect 
should be further established based on the open label long term CS7 study.  
The reduction of TG provides biomarker results on the effects of volanesorsen while the clinical 
implications of these effects were assessed in secondary endpoints of intensity and frequency of 
abdominal pain, and especially episodes of acute pancreatitis, although it is expected that events will 
be few with the number of patients included. Other supportive analyses include effects on other 
parameters of the lipid profile, among some others both including laboratory measurements as other 
associated clinical aspects and could provide further inside on the treatment effect.  
The sample size calculation in the pivotal study was considered appropriate. Sample size was 
determined ensuring sufficient power for the primary endpoint and based upon prior clinical trial 
experience. The stratified randomisation was also considered appropriate as the different stratification 
factors may affect the primary and secondary endpoints. Appropriate secure blinding principles of 
measurements and evaluation were applied of assessment of laboratory values by an independent 
laboratory and an external independent monitoring committee to review the safety data to avoid a 
possible increased risk.  
The applicant had sought scientific advice from the CHMP on the clinical development for this product. 
The advice pertained to the appropriate patient population to be included in the pivotal study, and the 
selection of endpoints which could support the claimed indication. 
The applicant followed the CHMP advice with respect to the proposed baseline TG threshold for 
inclusion in the pivotal study and the primary endpoint % change from baseline in fasting TG at 13 
weeks. Furthermore, recommendations with respect to an open-label extension of up to 52 weeks, 
stratification by the presence of background therapy and standardised meals were also followed for 
this application.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Phase 2 dose finding study 
In the monotherapy arm, volanesorsen therapy showed a dose-dependent ApoC-III reduction from 
baseline of 40%, 64%, and 80% at doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg once weekly, respectively, which 
was associated with dose-dependent TG reduction of 31%, 58%, and 71%, respectively. The fibrate 
therapy arm (-60% and -71% for ApoC- III and -51% and -64% for TG at 200 and 300 mg, 
respectively) and the FCS arm (-81.3% and -68.8% for ApoC-III and TG at 300 mg respectively) 
showed similar levels of reduction in ApoC-III and TG as the monotherapy arm. As the highest levels of 
ApoC-III and TG reduction were achieved with 300 mg once weekly and the 300 mg dose administered 
once weekly for 13 weeks was well tolerated, volanesorsen 300 mg weekly dose was selected for the 
phase 3 clinical program.

Phase 3 evaluation  
Overall, the baseline data in Study CS6 are representative of a patient population with FCS with very 
high levels of TG of 2209 mg/ml and 75.8% of the patients with history of acute pancreatitis. 
Furthermore, a total of 50 (76%) patients had confirmed mutations in type 1 causing genes of which 
the majority reported mutations in the LPL gene (82%) and 36 out of 66 (55%) patients tested had 
post heparin plasma LPL activity of ≤ 20% of normal.  
Patients in study CS16 represent a different population with an approximately 40% lower level of TG 
(1261 mg/dL versus 2209 mg/dL), and a higher BMI (30 vs 25). In this study CS16 only 7 patients 
with FCS were enrolled. 
In the pivotal study CS6 in FCS patients, volanesorsen demonstrated a substantial reduction of -77% 
(2267 mg/dL to 590 mg/dL) in TG compared to an increase of 18% for placebo, resulting in a 94% 
difference at month 3 (p<0.0001). All patients responded to volanesorsen treatment with the 
exception of one patient, which was considered a non-responder. Also, a much higher percentage of 
patients in the volanesorsen group achieved target TG levels of < 750 mg/dL compared with the 
placebo group (77% compared with 10%, respectively). The target level of TG < 750 mg/dL was 
chosen as at this level chylomicron accumulation becomes significant and it is thought that above this 
threshold acute pancreatitis risk is increased. Likewise, for patients with hypertriglyceridemia in study 
CS16 volanesorsen resulted in a substantial TG reduction of 72% from baseline (TG of 1183 mg/dL to 
294 mg/dL) compared with 3 % in placebo at Month 3 with a difference of 69% (p<0.0001). Moreover, 
the TG reduction from baseline to month 3 for 5 FCS patients (72%) in study CS16 was comparable to 
the TG reduction found in study CS6.  
Treatment with volanesorsen also resulted in favourable outcomes in other lipid parameters including 
chylomicron-TG, ApoC-III, ApoB-48, VLDL-C and non-HDL-C along with increases in HDL-C, however 
an increase in LDL-C was observed. It is agreed with the Applicant that the increased LDL-C, which 
remained below the ULN, was accompanied by a decrease in non-HDL-C, suggesting an overall anti-
atherogenic effect. The changes in lipid parameters observed in patients with hypertriglyceridemia in 
Study CS16 were comparable with those in the FCS population in Study CS6. 
Despite these positive findings, treatment with volanesorsen was associated with substantial number of 
discontinuations in study CS6 (42%, 14/33 volanesorsen vs 5.9%, 2/33 placebo)), and this was mainly 
due to adverse events (AE) (9 patients, including 5 patients with decreased platelet count). Moreover, 
eleven patients (10 volanesorsen and 1 in placebo) discontinued voluntary, which could likely be 
associated with the burden of the need for intense platelet monitoring. Further, tolerability issues were 
apparent due to the need of frequent dose adjustment to every 2 weeks (10 (30%) volanesorsen vs 0 
placebo), or dose interruptions (11 (33%) volanesorsen group versus 6 (18%) placebo), after a dose 
algorithm and frequent platelet monitoring protocol was implemented during the study. From the 19 
volanesorsen-treated FCS patients (58%) who completed the study, more than half of the patients 
(n=13) had their dose adjusted, whereas only 6 patients completed the study without dose 
adjustments.  
In study CS16, the most common reason for discontinuation of treatment was AE (20% in the 
volanesorsen group (n=15) and 8% in the placebo group (n=3), of which the majority were injection 
site reaction (33%)). Also in this study, 13 patients (12%; 9 volanesorsen and 4 in placebo) 
discontinued on their own volition and could be due to the burden of need for intense monitoring.  
Within the open-label study CS7, the dose algorithm and platelet monitoring was applied from the 
beginning. However, data until June 2018 showed a discontinuation rate due to AEs of 27% (18 
patients, including 9 patients which discontinued due to thrombocytopenia). Discontinuations due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 81/121 
 
 
 
 
 
other reasons remain unknown and could further inflate the overall discontinuation rate. Overall, the 
high percentage of discontinuations from study treatment may limit the possibility for long term 
treatment for most of the patients.  
The diminished TG-lowering effect after 3 months (-77%) to -53% and -40% from baseline, 
respectively, at month 6 and 12 appears to be associated with these dose adjustments and dose 
interruptions needed due to the occurrence of platelet count decreases. For instance, for the very few 
patients who completed the study without dose adjustments (n=6) TG reduction versus baseline at 
month 6 and 12 were higher with -80% and -76% compared to patients who completed the study with 
dose adjustments (n=13) (-52% and -54% at Month 6 and 12). As a result, less patients compared 
with the Month 3 time point maintained the target level of < 750 mg/dL after treatment with 
volanesorsen at Month 6 and Month 12 (77%, 47% and 37% in the volanesorsen group and 10%, 0% 
and 6.5% in the placebo group at Month 3, 6, and 12, respectively). 
Comparably, in study CS16, patients with post 13 weeks obliged dose reduction (n=50) to every 2 
weeks showed less pronounced TG-lowering effects (-62%) compared to patients on 300mg once 
weekly during the study (n=25; -78%). Of the 19 patients that completed one year on volanesorsen in 
study CS6, 14 have continued therapy in the open-label phase (3 on weekly 300 mg dose). The very 
limited open-label data demonstrate a maintenance of effect with percent change in fasting TG from 
baseline to 18 months (n=9) and 24 moths (n=3) of -53.1% and -60.8% (as per date cut off 31 Aug 
2017).  
To improve tolerability and reduce treatment discontinuation an initial weekly dose with subsequent 
biweekly dosing after 3 months and possible up-titration after 6 months when further lowering of TG is 
needed is being proposed. This is further discussed in the clinical safety section of this report.   
The assessment of the clinical impact of the TG lowering effect of volanesorsen is challenging, mainly 
due to the limited clinical data available (acute pancreatitis) and/or a lack of clear effects for other 
clinical related outcomes including abdominal pain. For the secondary endpoint of acute pancreatitis, a 
trend toward less frequent occurrence of these events was shown, with 1 event in 1 patient in the 
volanesorsen group compared with 4 events in 3 patients in the placebo group (p=0.6132). A similar 
positive trend could also be observed in study CS16 where 3 placebo patients had 5 events of acute 
pancreatitis during 26 weeks of treatment compared to none in the volanesorsen group (p=0.036). 
Furthermore, an exploratory analysis in study CS6 of patients with prior frequent acute pancreatitis 
events (≥ 2 events in the 5 years prior to treatment) showed for the 7 patients who had 24 
adjudicated pancreatitis attacks in the prior 5 years, no events during the 52 week treatment period 
for volanesorsen while for the 4 placebo patients who had 17 adjudicated pancreatitis attacks in the 
prior 5 years, 3 patients experienced 4 pancreatitis attacks during the 52-week treatment period.  
For abdominal pain, in study CS6 volanesorsen treatment did not affect the secondary endpoint of the 
overall number of patients who reported abdominal pain (15 patients (46%) volanesorsen and 14 
patients (42%) placebo) and the overall mean maximum abdominal pain intensity score (0.38 vs 
0.36). Also, for the combined adjudicated acute pancreatitis and/or moderate/severe abdominal pain 
on treatment no clear difference was shown (12 (36%) patients in the volanesorsen group and 13 
(39%) patients in the placebo group). However, fewer patients in the volanesorsen group (5 [15%]) 
reported severe abdominal pain events in comparison with the placebo group (8 [24%]) while on 
treatment, but not for moderate abdominal pain (6 [18%] vs 5 [15%]). In exploratory analyses, for 
those with abdominal pain at baseline (7 and 10 for volanesorsen and placebo) a trend towards a 
reduction in frequency of abdominal pain events (3 vs 11 events per patient per year) after 7-12 
months, and a reduction in episodes of moderate to severe abdominal pain (2 vs 5 events per patient 
per year in month 4-12; 2 vs 7 in month 7-12) and worst abdominal pain intensity (3.1 vs 5.4 month 
4-12; 2.4 vs 5.4 month 7-12) was observed.

However, as commented by the Expert group the reported effect of volanesorsen TG levels is of clinical 
relevance and in clinical practice should result in a reduction of the incidence of pancreatitis. It is likely 
that longer follow up and exposure in a larger number of patients would be needed to further be able 
to assess the clinical impact of maintained TG reductions on acute pancreatitis events. 
The CHMP considering the totality of the data and the comments raised by the Expert Group concluded 
that it would be appropriate to restrict the population that could be treated with volanesorsen to 
patients to patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response 
to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. Furthermore, secondary causes of 
hypertriglyceridemia (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism) should be excluded or appropriately 
addressed prior to initiation of treatment. 
The CHMP noted that this restricted indication better reflected the studied population in the clinical 
trials for which stringent criteria had been applied to define FCS.  Furthermore, and in view of the high 
discontinuation rates which to a large extent were due to the reduced platelet counts (See also Clinical 
Safety section) it was considered necessary to restrict the indication as a last line treatment option and 
only for patients most likely to benefit the most from treatment.  
To address the concerns of the CHMP, the applicant submitted a revised SmPC during the assessment 
procedure, restricting the therapeutic indication of the medicinal product.  
Additional expert consultation 
An Ad-Hoc Expert Advisory Group was asked to provide their view on the following issues: 
Question 1 
What  is  the  view  of  the  AHEG  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  reported  efficacy  of 
volanesorsen  on  the  level  of  serum  triglycerides  in  patients  with  FCS,  also  taking  into 
account the treatment discontinuations over time. 
The expert group considered that the reported effect of volanesorsen on serum triglyceride levels is of 
clinical relevance, even though this did not result in a statistical significant reduction in the incidence of 
pancreatitis.  The  group  noted that the  reported incidence  of pancreatitis  was considerably lower  than 
what  would  have  been  expected  in  patients  with  FCS.  The  group  observed  that  a  number  of  patients 
included in the pivotal trial had previously been treated with Glybera and considered this as a potential 
explanation for this observation due to residual effect on pancreatitis prevention carried over from the 
previous treatment.   
The group noted that the applicant’s proposal for the dosing regimen was lower than the one used in 
the pivotal clinical trial. Therefore, the triglyceride-lowering efficacy with the proposed dose is likely to 
be  less  than  the  one  observed  in  Study  CS06  and  additional  data  would  be  required  to  confirm  its 
efficacy (and the assumed reduction of the risk of thrombocytopenia). 
Question 2 
What  is  the  view  of  the  AHEG  on  the  reported  occurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  taking  into 
consideration the potentially safety risk (e.g. severe bleeding events). 
The group agreed that volanesorsen treatment is associated with a clear risk of thrombocytopenia. Of 
particular concern to the group was the fact that these events appear to be unpredictable in terms of 
patient susceptibility and time to onset and that in some cases low platelet count persisted more than 
what is typically observed for drug induced thrombocytopenia. The group was also concerned that the 
mechanism  of  action  for  the  thrombocytopenia  remains  largely  unknown  even  though  it  was 
acknowledged that reduced platelet counts has been observed with other anti-sense oligonucleotides.  
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 83/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Even  though  no  major  bleedings  have  been  observed  in  the  clinical  studies  performed  to  date,  the 
group  considered  that  the  observed  events  of  thrombocytopenia  in  the  studies  in  a  real-life  setting 
would be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. At this stage, with the data currently available, 
it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of this risk.  
Question 3 
Does  the  AHEG  consider  the  current  proposed  measures  of  a  2  weeks  platelet  monitoring 
schedule,  with  optional  ‘at  home’  blood  sampling,  and  additional  patient  and  care-giver 
education  sufficient, 
feasible  and  manageable  to  mitigate  the  consequences  of 
thrombocytopenia for an intended life-long treatment? 
The group considered that the proposals of the applicant for platelet monitoring are overall adequate to 
minimise  this  risk.  Even  though  the  onset  of  thrombocytopenia  is  not  possible  to  predict,  the  initial 
two-weekly  interval  for  monitoring  was  considered  appropriate  by  the  group.    The  drops  in  platelet 
counts  observed  in  the  trials  were  generally  gradual.  Any  trend  for  decrease  in  platelets  in  patients 
therefore should be able to be identified with the proposed monitoring before reaching levels that could 
lead to serious bleeding events.  
The experts agreed with the feasibility of the proposals and supported a home blood sampling scheme 
provided by the applicant. 
However, the group noted that a significant number of patients in the pivotal trial were receiving anti-
platelet drugs. As such use can also be expected in real-life due to the increased cardiovascular risk in 
these  patients  appropriate  risk  minimisation  measures  for  patients  with  concomitant  use  of  anti-
platelet should be implemented.  
Question 4 
The AHEG is asked whether a subgroup of patients with FCS, in the situation of high unmet 
medical  need,  could  likely  be  identified  in  whom  a  high  expected  benefit  could  be 
anticipated  despite  the  safety  profile  and  the  high  degree  of  discontinuations  as  currently 
observed. 
The group advised that the most appropriate target population for volanesorsen would be patients with 
a  definite  diagnosis  of  FCS,  as  described  for  instance  in  a  recent  paper  by  Stroes  et  al  (Diagnostic 
algorithm for familial chylomicronemia syndrome, Atherosclerosis Suppl., 23 (2017), pp. 1–7).  
In  addition  the  experts  considered  that  treatment  should  be  reserved  only  for  patients  who  are  not 
able to control their levels of triglycerides by other means (i.e. diet or pharmacological interventions). 
The  group  also  emphasised  that  treatment  should  only  be  initiated  once  secondary  causes  of 
hypertriglyceridemia have been excluded. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Volanesorsen demonstrated a substantial effect on TG during the first 3 months of therapy, which is 
slightly diminished during the rest of the treatment period up to 12 months. This could be due to the 
need for dose reductions and dose interruptions. Nevertheless, the effect could be maintained during 
this extended treatment period for patients able to remain on therapy. Further information on the 
long-term efficacy of volanesorsen will be collected through the planned Registry. 
A treatment effect on clinical endpoints was hampered due to the limited data available. A trend 
towards a clinical effect on pancreatitis could be observed, while any effect on abdominal pain was not

observed. However, it should be expected that the significant reduction in TG observed in the clinical 
trials would translate to a reduction in the events of pancreatitis in clinical practice in the long term.  
Therefore, it was concluded that volanesorsen is an effective treatment option for patients with FCS. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety data submitted in support of the use of volanesorsen is combined from a number of 
different sources as outlined below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the primary safety data for patients in the proposed indication are derived from Study CS6; 
study CS16 provides additional randomized, controlled data in a related patient population, 
patients with HTG; 
safety data from the Phase 3 studies: Study CS6, and Study CS16 provides additional 
randomized, controlled data in a related patient population (including some patients with HTG; 
safety data from patients with FCS from the pivotal and support studies (CS7 and CS16). This 
pooled analysis consisted of 86 patients and is the most representative analysis set for the 
overall safety profile of volanesorsen in the intended target population; 
The above datasets have different data lock-points as they include different studies.  
The overall exposure to volanesorsen in controlled to studies is provided in Table 33.

Adverse events 
In controlled studies, 985 TEAEs were reported in 32 (97%) patients in the volanesorsen group and 
227 TEAEs were reported in 31 (94%) patients in the placebo group at the time of the data cut-off. 
The most common AEs for patients receiving volanesorsen were events related to local tolerability and 
decreases in platelet counts. The majority of AEs (734 out of 985 events; 75%) were mild in severity.  
Local cutaneous reactions at the injection site (LCRIS; defined as those AEs at the injection site 
presenting as either pain, tenderness, erythema, pruritus, or swelling occurring on the day of injection 
and persisting for at least 2 days), occurred following 12% of injections in volanesorsen-treated 
patients; most LCRIS were mild and none were severe, and most resolved. Twenty (61%) 
volanesorsen-treated patients experienced at least 1 LCRIS during the study; no placebo-treated 
patients experienced these types of events.   
Twelve events of platelet count decreased were reported in 10 (30%) patients in the volanesorsen 
group and 5 thrombocytopenia events were reported in 4 (12%) patients in the volanesorsen group, 
compared with 1 event of platelet count decreased in 1 (3%) patient in the placebo group; these AEs 
were generally mild in severity. 
Bleeding events were reported in 16 (49%) patients in the volanesorsen group compared with 4 (12%) 
patients in the placebo group. Nearly half of these events were local to the injection site, which may be 
a  result  of  the  known  transient  effect  of  ASOs  on  the  tenase  complex.  Additional  bleeding  events 
occurring  in  more  than  5%  of  patients  were  epistaxis  in  5  (15%)  patients,  petechiae  in  4  (12%) 
patients, and vaginal haemorrhage in 2 (6%) patients. There were no major or severe bleeding events. 
There  was  no  apparent  relationship  between  bleeding  events  and  platelet  levels  or  the  use  of 
concomitant  antiplatelet  or  anticoagulant  medications.  Local  injection  reactions,  platelet  count 
decreased/thrombocytopenia, and bleeding events are further discussed in the section other significant 
events 
Other  most  commonly  reported  AEs  included  abdominal  pain  (27%  volanesorsen  vs  21%  placebo), 
headache  (21%  vs  15%),  fatigue  (21%  vs  9%),  erythema  (18%  vs  9%),  nausea  (18%  vs  6%), 
nasopharyngitis  (15%  vs  21%),  asthenia  (15%  vs  9%),  vomiting  (15%  vs  9%),  diarrhea  (15%  vs 
6%), myalgia (15% vs 3%), and epistaxis (15% vs 0%) in volanesorsen vs placebo.

Adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs),  or  AEs  related  or  possibly  related  to  drug  exposure,  in  patients  with 
FCS were determined by evaluating AEs that occurred with a ≥ 1% overall incidence rate and that 1) 
occurred  with  a  ≥  1%  difference  between  the  volanesorsen-treated  group  and  the  placebo  group, 
and/or  2)  had  an  apparent  dose  response  trend.  Medical  judgment  was  further  applied,  taking  into 
consideration  the  extent  to  which  the  AE  was  consistent  with  the  pharmacology  of  the  drug  and  the 
consistency  of  the  pattern  of  symptoms  across  studies.  Adverse  drug  reactions  were  identified  that 
occurred  in  patients  who  were  treated  in  the  completed  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  CS6. 
Additionally, any noteworthy AEs not meeting the ≥ 1% difference between the volanesorsen-treated 
group vs the placebo group, or those occurring at an incidence rate of < 1% during the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase were also evaluated.  
Related  on-treatment  AEs  (excluding  AEs  at  the  injection  site)  occurring  in  > 5%  of  patients  in  the

common AEs for patients receiving volanesorsen were local injection site reaction (21.7%-44.2%), 
pyrexia (15%), fatigue (12%), and asthenia and chills (10% each), nasopharyngitis (34%), influenza 
(15%), and urinary tract infection (12%), abdominal pain (25%), nausea (24%), diarrhea (13%), 
vomiting (10%), cough and arthralgia (18% each); headache (16%); pain in extremity (13%); and, 
dizziness, myalgia, and oropharyngeal pain (10% each). Most commonly treatment related AEs

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In study CS6 and CS16, serious AEs were reported on treatment in 13 (13%) patients in the 
volanesorsen group and 8 (11%) patients in the placebo group. Three SAEs in 3 (3%) patients in the 
volanesorsen group were considered potentially related to study drug, and none in the placebo group. 
The potentially related SAEs included the 2 reports of thrombocytopenia (CS6) and a report of serum 
sickness (CS16). In study CS6, the 2 (6%) grade 4 thrombocytopenia (< 25,000/mm3) led to 
treatment discontinuation, and subsequently, a more intensive platelet monitoring plan was 
implemented.  
In study CS6, other SAEs in the volanesorsen group were abdominal pain in 1 (3%) patient 
(adjudicated as pancreatitis), cyst in 1 (3%) patient, cholangitis and drug-induced liver injury 
(following diclofenac) in 1 (3%) patient, ankle fracture in 1 (3%) patient, and dehydration in 1 (3%) 
patient; except for severe dehydration, these events were moderate in severity and none were 
considered related to study treatment. The ankle fracture and dehydration both resulted in interruption 
of study treatment. No action was taken with study treatment for the other SAEs and all were reported 
as resolved. 
In Study CS16, 4 on-treatment potential MACE cases were adjudicated (none in study CS6). 
One patient of these 4 was found to be not applicable (event determined to be non-cardiac chest 
pain); 2 were found to be elective re-vascularization, and thus non-coronary events, and 1 MACE was 
adjudicated as stroke.  All were unrelated to study drug and occurred in patients treated with 
volanesorsen with established cardiovascular disease or symptoms of cardiovascular disease.    
In the ongoing study CS7, thirteen (19%) patients (10 treatment naïve, 2 volanesorsen from CS6, 1 
from CS16) reported a serious adverse event (SAE). Also, 4 cases of pancreatitis were observed and 1 
case of proteinuria. The cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, platelet count decreased, 1 event of 
thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria were considered related to study drug. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during the clinical development program.

Other significant events 
Platelet counts 
In study CS6, mean decreases in platelets were observed over time for patients in the volanesorsen 
group as compared to those in the placebo group with lowest level of 134,000/mm3 (Week 25) and 
207,000 mm3 (Week 48), respectively; and mean change from baseline of -48,000/mm3 and 
25,000/mm3, respectively. Similar findings could be observed for study CS16. 
In study CS6, 75% for volanesorsen vs 24% for placebo had a decrease below normal level of platelet 
count (< 140,000/mm3, Table 37).

a The baseline of platelets was defined as the average of all pre-dose values. 
b A confirmed value was based on a consecutive lab value within 7 days.  If that value was in the same 
or worse category the initial value was confirmed.  If the consecutive value was in a better category 
than the initial value was confirmed using the consecutive value category.  If there was no retest 
within 7 days, the initial value was presumed confirmed. 
c Baseline platelet count could not be obtained in 1 patient because of hemolysis. 
In study CS6, platelet count decreased AEs was 10 (30%) vs 1 (3%), and thrombocytopenia was 
4 (12%) vs none, respectively, and were generally mild in severity and managed with dose pauses and 
adjustments. In study CS16, this was 3 (4%) vs 2 (5%) and 10 (13%) vs 2 (5%). As no overlap exists 
between the two definitions, this results in study CS6 24/33 volanesorsen-treated patients (75%) had 
confirmed post-baseline platelet count below the LLN (140,000/mm3), and TEAE of ‘thrombocytopenia/ 
platelet count decreased’ was reported in 14 patients (42.4%). In study CS16 results were 28/75 
volanesorsen-treated patients (37%) had a confirmed post-baseline platelet count below the LLN 
(140,000/mm3), and TEAE of ‘thrombocytopenia/ platelet count decreased’ was reported in 13 patients 
(17%). 
In study CS16, the proportion of patients according to categories of platelet count reductions were not 
different between patients with 300 mg weekly dosing and 300 mg biweekly dosing (Table 38). Mean 
platelet count decrease was -52 (x10^9/L) at week 13, -65 at week 26 for 300 mg weekly (n=25) 
from a 238 (SD 69) baseline level and -72 and -67 for a selection of patients from the 300 mg 
biweekly group (n=15 of 27 treated during end of study) from a 247 (SD 83) baseline level.

Table 38. Summary of Confirmed Nadir Post-Baseline Platelet Counts in Study CS16 – All Patients (N 
= 113) 
Platelet count reductions were observed immediately after initiation but mostly between 3 to 6 months 
in the phase 3 studies (Figure 20). This decline reached a plateau where the group mean platelet 
count was approximately 30% lower than the baseline value. Three of the 5 patients who had platelet 
reductions to < 50,000/mm3 experienced the events within 13 weeks, the other 2 after 26 weeks, and 
were not associated with major or severe bleeding, while 1 had a non-major bleeding of moderate and 
mild injection site haemorrhages. Two patients with platelet counts < 25,000/mm3 had epistaxis non-
major bleed, being mild and not requiring specific treatment or intervention.  Platelet counts returned 
to normal in all patients following dose pause or discontinuation of study drug and/or administration of 
corticosteroids. One of the patients with platelet count < 25,000/mm3 was also treated with 
intravenous immunoglobulin. Four more cases were identified during the open-label CS7 study (and 
thus after dose algorithm implementation) that led to treatment discontinuation (see further below). 
Overall, platelet count decreased events were reported in 12 (18%) patients and thrombocytopenia 
was reported in 6 (9%) patients in the ongoing -study CS7.

In the open-label study CS7 (as of December 2017), median time to first dose reduction was 92 days 
and median time to first dose pause was 180 days. Median number of dose pauses per patients were 2 
with a median time of 16 days per patient during a median follow up of 247 days in the treatment-
naïve group and 736 days in the CS6-volanesorsen group. 
A statistical association between platelet count percent decrease and body weight was observed (p 
< 0.0001) (Figure 21), suggesting that patients on the lower weight spectrum may have an increased 
risk of platelet reductions.  However, in CS7, only a weak correlation with body weight was observed 
(data not shown).

Bleeding events 
In Study CS6, 20 patients experienced 50 bleeding events (16 patients had 45 events in the 
volanesorsen group and 4 patients had 5 events in the placebo group); 20 (40%) of the 50 bleeding 
events were reported at the injection site; there appears to be no correlation between platelet counts 
and bleeding events; and no increased risk of bleeding events with concurrent antiplatelet or 
anticoagulation medications. 
The most commonly reported bleeding events in the volanesorsen group (excluding the injection site 
events and laboratory abnormalities) were epistaxis in 5 (15%) patients, petechiae (4 (12%)) and 
vaginal hemorrhage 2 (6%), versus none in placebo. All bleeding events were mild; none were 
reported as SAEs, none were major bleedings, and none led to treatment discontinuation. 
Most patients experienced bleeding events within 13 weeks of therapy (44 (30%) ≤ 13weeks, 16 
(12.5%) > 13-26 weeks, and 17 (3.4%) > 26 weeks for volanesorsen; 8 (8.3%), 5 (5.6%), 4 (4.9%) 
for placebo) in the combined phase 2 and 3 studies. This is also displayed graphically for the combined 
phase 3 studies (Figure 23).

Injection site reactions 
In Study CS6, 20 (61%) volanesorsen-treated patients vs none in placebo experienced at least 1 
injection site reaction, (lasting > 2 days). The most commonly reported AEs at the injection site in the 
volanesorsen group were injection site erythema (17 patients, 52%), injection site pain (8 patients, 
24%), and injection site pruritus (5 patients, 15%), and injection site swelling (3 patients, 9.1%).  
In study CS6 and CS16, a total of 68 (63%) of 108 patients (663 total events) for volanesorsen and 
2 (3%) of 71 patients (3 total events) for placebo had an injection site reaction. Median time to onset 
for injection site reactions in the phase 3 studies for volanesorsen group was 4.3 weeks, indicating that 
when these events first occur, it is early on in therapy (Figure 24), and incidence appeared to 
decrease over time.

Immunological events 
Relatively high incidences in anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed (10 patients (30%) in 
volanesorsen vs 1 patient (3%) in placebo in study CS6 and 12 patients (16%) in volanesorsen vs 2 
patients (5%) in placebo in study CS16. The median time of onset in these ADA-positive patients was 
Study Day 179.5 and 165 for study CS6 and CS16, respectively. The presence of ADA was not 
associated with a different safety outcome, since patients with ADA had similar patient characteristics 
and AE frequencies as patients without ADA.  
In study CS6, the demographics of patients who tested positive for ADA were similar to those who 
were negative. Six of the 10 (60%) ADA-positive patients in the volanesorsen group discontinued 
treatment as compared to 8 of 23 (35%) ADA-negative patients which discontinued treatment. 
However, 4 ADA-positive patients in the volanesorsen group discontinued treatment prior to 
seroconversion and 2 patients after seroconversion, suggesting that the presence of ADA is unlikely to 
have affected patient disposition.  
The most commonly reported AEs for volanesorsen in both antibody-positive and antibody-negative 
patients were events related to local tolerability. Nine of 10 (90%) ADA-positive patients and 20 of 23 
(87%) IM-negative patients reported these events. There was no notable difference in the incidence of 
LCRIS between ADA-positive (7 of 10 patients, 70%) and ADA-negative patients (13 of 23 patients, 
57%). Overall, ADA development did not appear to be associated with a higher occurrence of AEs. 
There were no notable differences in the levels of platelet count (IM-positive: 38%; 3 of 8), IM 
negative (78%; 18 of 23) for confirmed platelet counts < 140,000 /mm3), ALT, AST, creatinine 
clearance, hsCRP, complement C5a, and complement Bb between ADA-positive patients and antibody-
negative patients. There was no increased incidence of platelet count decrease, ALT elevations above 
3×ULN, and ALP elevations above 2×ULN) in the antibody-positive patients. 
Flu-like reactions 
In the phase 3 studies (CS6 and CS16), 4 (4%) of 108 patients in the volanesorsen group experienced 
a total of 6 flu-like reactions (FLRs). These included 3 patients who experienced an AE of influenza-like

illness (2 in CS6 and 1 in CS16) and 1 patient who experienced pyrexia/feeling hot with arthralgia and 
myalgia (non-FCS patient in Study CS16). These FLRs represent isolated events not representative of a 
systemic reaction associated with volanesorsen administration. 
Laboratory findings 
A summary of laboratory abnormalities (other than decreased platelets) I n study CS6 and CS16, are 
presented below. 
•  Creatinine: Three patients had any shifts from normal to high; 2 patients received 
volanesorsen (1 each in Study CS6 and CS16) and experienced a shift from normal (< 1.5 
µmol/L) to 2.1 2.5 µmol/L while on treatment and the third received volanesorsen in Study 
CS16 and had a shift from normal to 1.5 1.7 µmol/L for creatinine. 
•  BUN: shifts in BUN while on treatment were experienced by both patients groups. A total of 11 
of 108 patients in the volansorsen group and 7 of 71 patients in the placebo group had shifts 
from ≤ 26 mg/dL to ≥ 27 mg/dL for BUN. 
•  ALT: In the volanesorsen group, 9 of 108 patients had on-treatment shifts in ALT from <2.5 × 
ULN to >2.5 × ULN; 1 each of these patients had shifts to > 5× ULN and >10 × ULN. Both of 
the values > 5× ULN were confirmed within 7 days. No volanesorsen-treated patient 
experienced elevations in bilirubin to > 2 × ULN. One patient in the placebo group had a shift 
from normal (< 1.1 × ULN) to the 5.1 10 × ULN category for ALT, which was confirmed. 
•  AST: In the volanesorsen group, 4 of 108 patients had on-treatment shifts in AST from <2.5 × 
ULN to >2.5 × ULN; 1 each of these patients had shifts to > 5× ULN and >10 × ULN.  All shifts 
> 2.5 × ULN were confirmed within 7 days for the volanesorsen group. One patient in the 
placebo group had a shift from normal (< 1.1 × ULN) to the 5.1 10 × ULN category for AST 
and another had a shift to the 2.6 5.0 × ULN category; the shift >5 × ULN was not confirmed. 
No events related to increased ALT, AST, ALP, or bilirubin increases led to discontinuation of treatment. 
The patient-based incidence rate of on-study events of ALT > 3 × ULN was 8.9 (95% CI:  3.49, 22.84) 
per 100 patient-years in the pooled volanesorsen group and 2.2 (95% CI:  0.31, 15.56) per 100 
patient-years in the pooled placebo group. 
Volanesorsen treatment did not affect haemoglobin or leukocytes.  
Safety in special populations 
The number of AEs experienced by younger patients (< 65 years) was higher than older patients (3249 
vs 202 AEs, respectively), but the proportion of patients experiencing AEs was similar between 
volanesorsen and placebo (98% vs 90% for < 65 years and 100% vs 100% for ≥ 65 years, 
respectively).  
When including patients from the Phase 2 studies, it appears as though a higher proportion of older 
patients experienced bleeding events (55% of volanesorsen patients) compared to younger patients 
(39% of volanesorsen patients).  All platelet reductions to < 50,000/mm3 were experienced by 
patients < 65 years old.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In the Phase 3 studies CS6 and CS16, 44 of 108 volanesorsen-treated patients were receiving 
antiplatelet drugs and the incidence of bleeding events does not seem to be higher in these patients.

Discontinuations due to injection site reactions 
Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Group 
Permanent discontinuations of study drug due to AEs at the injection site were reported in 10 patients 
in the volanesorsen group (1 in CS6, 9 in CS16), but not in the placebo group; in most cases multiple 
specific AEs at the injection site contributed to discontinuation in each patient. Specific reasons for 
discontinuation due to AEs at the injection site in the pooled volanesorsen group included injection site 
erythema (7 patients, 6%), injection site pain (7 patients, 6%), injection site swelling (3 patients, 
2%), injection site discoloration (2 patients, 2%), injection site edema (2 patients, 2%), and injection 
site discomfort, injection site pruritus, injection site rash, and injection site warmth in 1 patient each 
(< 1%). 
Discontinuations due to decrease in platelet counts 
Across Studies CS6, CS16, and CS2, 5 patients had platelet reductions to < 50,000/mm3, 2 of which 
were declines to < 25,000/mm3, 3 of which led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment 
(Table 40). In Study CS6, 2 of these events were considered serious (declines to < 25,000/mm3) and 
resulted in treatment discontinuation. In addition to these SAEs, 1 non-serious AE of thrombocytopenia 
and 2 non-serious AEs of decreased platelet count led to permanent discontinuation from study 
treatment; these patients are described briefly below.

In the ongoing open label extension study CS7 (as per cut-off date June 2018), 4 cases of severe 
thrombocytopenia (Table 41) were reported and led to treatment discontinuation. These cases 
included: 
•  One case occurred around Day 85 of volanesorsen treatment in the open-label study CS7 and while 
the patient was on vacation during the December 2016 / January 2017 holidays and missed her 
regular weekly platelet count blood draws.  
•  An AE of platelet count < 50,000/mm3 (nadir of 37,000/mm3) was reported in a treatment-naïve 
patient after approximately 80 days of volanesorsen treatment in the open-label extension study 
CS7 while the patient was being treated according to the treatment algorithm and monitoring 
schedule.  
•  Another patient, coming from the placebo CS6, reported a platelet nadir of 28,000/mm3 on study 
Day 159.

All these severe cases of thrombocytopenia used corticosteroid treatment to recover. Eighteen (27%) 
patients in study CS7 discontinued study treatment because of AEs. Other AEs leading to 
discontinuation of volanesorsen treatment in study CS7 were (reported in one patient for each) 
moderate vasculitis, moderate sensory loss, and mild injection site rash, severe chills, severe neck 
pain, and severe pain in jaw, severe serum sickness-like reaction, severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
severe vomiting, severe headache, moderate abdominal pain, mild contusion, moderate diarrhea, mild 
nausea, and mild blurred vision, moderate myalgia and moderate chills, mild fatigue and mild myalgia, 
severe proteinuria and moderate anxiety. 
Study CS13 – Thorough QT Study 
Study CS13 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover tQTc study in healthy volunteers 
to determine if volanesorsen administered as a single therapeutic dose (300 mg SC) and a single

supra-therapeutic dose (300 mg IV) delayed cardiac repolarization as determined by the measurement 
of QT/QTc interval when compared with moxifloxacin as positive control. A total of 52 healthy male and 
female subjects were enrolled in this 4-way crossover study. 
Treatment with volanesorsen did not prolong QTc to a clinically significant degree nor did it affect other 
ECG parameters including heart rate, PR, or QRS intervals. The largest mean effect on ΔΔQTcF at any 
post-dose time-point was 3.0 msec (90% CI: 0.8 to 5.2) after SC dosing and 1.8 msec after IV dosing. 
The QT effect of 400 mg moxifloxacin confirmed the study’s assay sensitivity with mean ΔΔQTcF at the 
predefined time-points (2, 3, and 4 hours) of 9.0 msec, 11.0 msec, and 11.6 msec, respectively, with 
all lower bounds of the 90% CI above 5 msec.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For the target population, a limited number of 86 FCS patients have been treated with volanesorsen. 
These include patients from the pivotal CS6 study and the ongoing open label single arm extension 
study CS7: with 30 placebo treated patients, 14 patients previously treated with volanesorsen from 
study CS6, 3 previously treated in study CS16, and 20 complete naïve patients included. Placebo 
controlled data for the FCS patients is limited to 267 days of treatment with volanesorsen and this is 
shorter than the 352 days for placebo. Additional placebo controlled data come from the CS16 study, 
which included a very limited number of FCS patients (5 FCS on volanesorsen and 2 FCS on placebo), 
though 75 vs 38 patients with HTG (high triglycerides). The overall safety database is therefore 
relatively limited but acceptable in the context of a rare and orphan disease like FCS. 
The most commonly reported AEs were injection site reactions. The most commonly observed in the 
phase 3 studies were injection site erythema (79% vs 4%), injection site pain (49% vs 7%), injection 
site swelling (37% vs 4%), injection site pruritus (31% vs 0%), and injections site discoloration (27% 
vs 0%) for volanesorsen vs placebo. And these events occurred mostly at initiation of therapy (≤13 
weeks 63%, 13-26 weeks 17%, and > 26 weeks 8% in the overall placebo controlled pool) and were 
mild or moderate in severity. None of the injection site AEs were severe, but not all of these events 
resolved (5 patients CS6 and 8 patients in CS16). To minimise such reactions, it is important to rotate 
sites for injection. Sites for injection include the abdomen, upper thigh region, or outer area of the 
upper arm. If injected in the upper arm, the injection should be administered by another person. 
Injection should be avoided at the waistline and other sites where pressure or rubbing may occur from 
clothing. This medicinal product should not be injected into tattoos, moles, birthmarks, bruises, rashes, 
or areas where the skin is tender, red, hard, bruised, damaged, burned, or inflamed. 
In the placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 studies, eighteen (13%) patients in the volanesorsen group 
experienced 24 serious adverse events (SAEs) and 9 (9%) patients in the placebo group experienced 
16 SAEs. However, the most reported and only considered as related to treatment SAEs was 
thrombocytopenia (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 2 patients (6%) in study CS6 and 4 in the ongoing 
open label study CS7).  
Four MACE events found in study CS16 were not considered related to study drug. Any QT prolonging 
or other arrhythmic potential of volanesorsen was considered unlikely based on the absence of any 
pro-arrhythmic effect in in vitro, preclinical studies, the Thorough QT study  and phase 3 ECG data.  
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 101/121 
 
 
 
Overall, higher frequencies of AEs were observed for volanesorsen than for placebo with local 
tolerability (82% vs 14% in FCS patients and 96% vs 32% in non-FCS for volanesorsen vs placebo) 
and decreases in platelet count (75% vs 24% in FCS patients for volanesorsen vs placebo (platelet 
count < 140,000/mm3)) being the most noticeable adverse effects, although most were mild or 
moderate in severity. Bleeding events were also commonly reported (36% vs 14% of the patients with 
approximately 3 events vs 1 event per patient in the phase 3 placebo controlled studies). 
Approximately half of them occurred at the injection site. Other most reported AEs (excluding AEs at 
injection site) were fatigue (16% volanesorsen vs 10% placebo), abdominal pain (15% vs 8%), 
diarrhoea (14% vs 9%), and nausea (13% vs 4%). 
Due to observed severe platelet count reductions in 2 patients in study CS6 protocol amendments were 
performed for a strict dose algorithm and platelet count monitoring and for study CS16 the protocol 
was amended at week 13 such that patients had to be treated with biweekly 300 mg volanesorsen 
instead of weekly 300 mg volanesorsen. For volanesorsen, reduced levels of platelet counts were seen 
early after start of treatment but were most notable during month 3-6. In the pivotal study (CS6) a 
larger number of patients had reduced platelet counts for volanesorsen compared to placebo (75% vs 
24% < 140,000/mm3;28% vs 24% 100,000/mm3-140,000/mm3; 19% vs 0% 75,000/mm3-
100,000/mm3; 19% vs 0% 50,000/mm3-75,000/mm3and 3 vs 0 patients < 50,000/mm3).  Also, 
thrombocytopenia (13% vs 2%) and platelet count decreased (14% vs 4%) were reported as common 
treatment related adverse events during the placebo controlled phase 3 studies. Large proportions of 
patients had their dose reduced to biweekly dosing (n=10; 30% in study CS6 (vs 0 placebo), n=29; 
38% in study CS16; n=6; 21% in study CS7). For study CS6, dose reductions all occurred between 
week 26-46. A substantial proportion of patients had their dose interrupted (n=11; 33% in study CS6, 
n=10; 13.3% in study CS16) primarily due to AEs or lab values and this was substantially more than in 
the placebo arm (n=6; 18% in study CS6, n=3; 8% in study CS16). For treatment naïve patients 
entering the open-label study CS7 the data presented suggest similar results. 
Despite the new dose algorithm and monitoring interventions rare occurrences of sudden severe drops 
in platelet counts were still observed. Two serious events of thrombocytopenia occurred before 
algorithm implementation and 4 more cases were identified during the open-label CS7 study (after 
dose algorithm implementation) all leading to treatment discontinuation. It is reassuring however, that 
for the thrombocytopenia cases in CS7, platelet levels recovered to > 50000/m3 within 3 to 6 days, 
although corticosteroid therapy was needed in all severe cases of thrombocytopenia. 
Currently there are no predictive factors of such events. The applicant provided some data to 
demonstrate that for many patients the decrease in platelet count was dose-dependent. Data on 
steady state exposure in relation to platelet count categories of maximum reduction in platelet count, 
and baseline weight versus maximum reduction in platelet count show some moderate correlations, 
and data according to body weight <70 kg show a larger reduction in platelet count with the lower 
body weight category.  
None of the severe reductions in platelet counts were associated with major or severe bleedings, 
although non-major bleedings (hemorrhage and epistaxis in 1 patient each in study CS6) were 
observed.  
Bleeding events were observed more for volanesorsen than placebo with 36% vs 14% of the patients 
with approximately 3 events vs 1 event per patient in the phase 3 placebo controlled studies. Most 
events were reported at initiation of therapy (≤ 13 weeks 29.9% patients; 13-16 weeks 12.5%; > 26 
weeks 13.4% in the placebo controlled studies). This may indicate that bleeding events are unlikely to 
be directly associated to the observed reduction in platelet counts as this primarily appeared to occur 
later during the study. Moreover, approximately 40% of the bleedings were local at the injection site 
(in study CS6). This is explained by the applicant as due to a transient disruption of the contact

pathway, while antisense oligonucleotides are known to affect the tenase complex, although the last 
effect is more considered a systemic effect. Local bleeding events mostly observed were injection site 
bruising (15% vs 1.6%), injection site haemorrhage (7% vs 0%), and injection site hematoma (4% vs 
1.6%). Any major bleedings were not observed, while non-major bleedings of 8 (24%) vs 4 (12%) 
patients vs placebo in study CS6 were observed. No major bleedings have occurred in the study CS7 to 
date. 
Volanesorsen patients were more likely to discontinue treatment than patients treated with placebo 
throughout the clinical program (25 (17%) volanesorsen vs 2 (2%) placebo due to AE in phase 2/3 
studies). Discontinuations due to AEs were frequently observed with the treatment of volanesorsen 
(27% (n=9) in study CS6, 19% (n=14) in study CS16) vs placebo (0% in study CS6, 2 (5%) in study 
CS16) and mostly related to injection site reaction or platelet count reduction/thrombocytopenia. 
Similar discontinuation rates due to AEs were observed in study CS7.  
Apart from discontinuation due to AEs, voluntary discontinuations were also observed. Discontinuations 
for reduced platelet count or thrombocytopenia was found in 15% (n=5) in study CS6 and 1.3% (n=1) 
in study CS16, and discontinuation associated with injection site reaction were 3% (n=1) in study CS6 
and 12% (n=9) in study CS16 with volanesorsen treatment vs none in placebo. Several of the patients 
who discontinued due to low platelet levels were rechallenged with study treatment before they 
permanently discontinued study treatment. Most study discontinuations occurred early during study, 
within the first 13 weeks, in particular for injection site reactions, and thus selection of those patients 
who can tolerate treatment is apparent early on treatment. Discontinuations due to low platelet levels, 
especially the previously mentioned severe cases, appear unpredictable.  
It is clear from the available data that the reduction of platelet levels in association with volanesorsen 
is of particular concern and was also acknowledged by the Ad-Hoc Expert Advisory Group. In order to 
minimise this risk the applicant modified the initially proposed dosing frequency which should be 
reduced after 3 months of treatment from once weekly to once every 2 weeks. This proposal is line 
with the amended protocol of study CS16.  
Moreover a number of monitoring and treatment recommendations have been introduced to minimise 
the potential adverse events of low platelet count. Monitoring of platelets should be done every 2 
weeks for patients with normal counts, weekly for counts between 75-139 x109/L, every 2-3 days for 
counts between 50-74 x109/L and daily for lower values. For patients with platelet counts between 50-
99x109/L, treatment should be paused for≥4 weeks and resumed after platelet levels reach ≥ 100 
x109/L. If platelet counts are less than 50 109/L treatment should be discontinued and use of 
glucocorticoids is recommended. Before initiation of treatment, platelet count should be measured. If 
the platelet count is below 140 x109/L another measurement should be taken approximately a week 
later to reassess. If platelet counts remain below 140 x 109/L upon a second measurement, treatment 
should not be initiated. Finally volanesorsen is contraindicated in patients with chronic or unexplained 
thrombocytopenia. 
The constant monitoring and subsequent dose alteration or stopping raises question regarding patient 
compliance to treatment even though it is acknowledged that FCS patients are probably highly 
motivated due to the impact of the disease in their quality of life. In the open-label study, for 2 
patients (out of 50 treatment naïve patients) the burden of frequent monitoring could be related to 
patient withdrawal, and for 2 patients to frequent monitoring and study burden in general (as of 
December 2017). Moreover, even though the strictest algorithm was implemented, still 9 patients 
discontinued due to platelet count decreases in OLE study CS7, with 4 patients with severe 
thrombocytopenia (as of June 2018).  
The CHMP considered that even though the risk of thrombocytopenia appears to be relatively well 
characterised, current data cannot be considered comprehensive. The impact of the proposed dosing 
Assessment report

Page 103/121 
 
 
 
algorithm in reducing this risk and adherence to the platelet monitoring / dose adjustment algorithm 
remain unknown. Further data will therefore be required and the applicant will conduct a post-
authorisation safety study, using a registry to monitor the incidence of thrombocytopenia and potential 
bleeding once the product has been authorised.  
In addition to these aspects, the CHMP also considered that a long term follow-up of patients within 
the registry will be needed even if the specific uncertainties underlying the need for the PASS 
mentioned above are addressed. It is expected therefore, that following the study completion the 
follow-up of the patients will continue through the registry.  
In addition, educational materials will be available for potential prescribers, patients and carers and will 
outline the importance of platelet monitoring and dose frequency adjustment on signs and symptoms 
of bleeding, and on the need to seek immediate treatment.  
Volanesorsen is an ASO (antisense oligonucleotide) which have been associated with class concerns 
such as injection site reactions, thrombocytopenia, liver toxicity, renal toxicity, and immunological 
effects (flu like symptoms, antidrug antibodies). 
Flu-like symptoms were adverse events of special interest as these have been observed with previous 
antisense oligonucleotides. These events were limited with 4 (4%) of 108 patients in the volanesorsen 
group experiencing a total of 6 FLRs over the course of study treatment. These included 3 patients who 
experienced an AE of influenza-like illness (2 in CS6 and 1 in CS16) and 1 patient who experienced 
pyrexia/feeling hot with arthralgia and myalgia (non-FCS patient in Study CS16). 
In terms of laboratory abnormalities an increase in creatinine was observed in 3 patients (2 on study 
treatment). Further, a case of severe proteinuria leading to hospitalisation and discontinuation of study 
drug was reported in study CS7. This strengthens the potential accumulation of volanesorsen in the 
kidney based also on non-clinical PK data and kidney findings in the toxicology studies. Therefore, the 
renal safety profile should be monitored during treatment and has been included in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. Monitoring for evidence of nephrotoxicity by routine urine dipstick is 
recommended on a quarterly basis. In the case of a positive assessment, a broader assessment of 
renal function, including serum creatinine and a 24-hour collection to quantify the proteinuria and 
assess creatinine clearance, should be performed. Treatment should be discontinued if: proteinuria of 
≥ 500 mg/24 hour is recorded, or an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) that is 
>ULN is recorded, or creatinine clearance estimated by the CKD-EPI equation is≤30 mL/min/1.73m2. 
Treatment should also be discontinued for any clinical symptoms or signs of renal impairment pending 
the previous confirmatory assessment. 
Some cases of increase in ALT or AST were observed in volanesorsen users (15 patients >2.5 × ULN). 
Taking into account its mechanism of action which may lead to accumulation of triglycerides in liver 
cells, the theoretical risk of accumulation of volanesorsen in the liver based on non-clinical PK, and the 
fact that hepatotoxicity has appeared to be an important issue for other ASOs, hepatotoxicity is 
included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity through serum liver 
enzymes and bilirubin should be assessed on a quarterly basis. Treatment should be discontinued if 
there is a single increase in ALT or AST > 8 x ULN, or an increase > 5 x ULN, which persists for ≥ 2 
weeks, or lesser increases in ALT or AST that are associated with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or INR > 
1.5. Treatment should also be discontinued for any clinical symptoms or signs of hepatic impairment or 
hepatitis. 
Although patients treated with volanesorsen were frequently tested positive for antidrug-antibodies 
(ADA) (30% in study CS6 (vs 3% placebo) and 16% in study CS16 (vs 5% placebo)), this did not 
appear to be associated with any particular safety concern. However, taking into account, the limited 
long-term data and the known potential serious risks such antibodies are associated with, 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 104/121 
 
 
 
immunogenicity and hypersensitivity have been included in the RMP as important potential risks and 
will be prospectively assessed in the post-marketing setting. 
The post-authorisation safety study designed to characterise the risk of thrombocytopenia will also 
investigate the severity of immunogenicity/immunological events, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity and 
severe injection site reactions.  
There is limited experience in patients > 65 years of age, which does not allow for any robust 
conclusion on the safety aspects of volanesorsen in these older patients. For the data observed, 
comparable number of events could be observed in comparison to the younger age group, except that 
bleeding events were higher in the older age group (55% vs 39%). 
Additional expert consultations 
See discussion on clinical efficacy. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that comprehensive 
data on the product are not available, due to the small size of the clinical trials and the uncertainties 
around the proposed dosing algorithm and whether it can effectively minimise the risk of 
thrombocytopenia in FCS patients.  
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a conditional marketing authorisation should be granted 
subject to a specific obligation to conduct a study in order to evaluate the impact and adherence in 
clinical practice of the treatment algorithm on the risk of thrombocytopenia. 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity of FCS, the overall safety profile of 
volanesorsen has been adequately characterised. The main safety concern identified is that of 
thrombocytopenia for which a number of additional risk minimisation measures will be implemented 
and monitored through a post-authorisation safety study based on a registry. The other potential risks 
are considered manageable with warnings in the product information. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
•  A Post-Authorisation Safety Study based on a Registry in order to evaluate the safety of 
Waylivra on thrombocytopenia and bleeding (including incidence rate, severity and outcomes)  
in FCS patients according to the dose recommendation and dose algorithm and investigate 
adherence with platelet monitoring and dose adjustment requirements.   
The applicant will also ensure the long term follow-up of patients in the Registry

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of volanesorsen with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers volanesorsen to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14(7)] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
Third party intervention during the evaluation of Waylivra 
LPLD Alliance, a registered charity working in support of people affected by Familial Chylomicronaemia 
Syndrome (FCS) sent two letters to the CHMP describing the impact of the disease in the quality of 
affected patients and the impact that Waylivra has had on patients that participated in the trials.  
The CHMP took note of the letters submitted by LPLD Alliance.  
In order to obtain a real-life perspective in relation to the use of volanesorsen, two of the trustees of 
the charity participated in the Ad-Hoc Expert Advisory for Waylivra.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Volanesorsen is proposed to be indicated for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome 
(FCS), a genetic based orphan disease characterised by extremely high serum triglycerides (TG) (> 
880 mg/dL, 10 mmol/L). These are carried primarily in chylomicrons (dietary lipids). FCS affects an 
estimated 3000-5000 patients globally (1-2 in a million). The most serious effects are severe 
abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis, which can occasionally lead to death. Other effects are 
cognitive impairment (‘’brain fog’’) and muscle and joint pain. Approximately 65-80% of patients with 
FCS will experience at least one episode of acute pancreatitis, with the majority experiencing recurrent 
episodes. Aim of therapy is to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels preferably to such levels (< 750 mg/dL) 
that occasional cases of acute pancreatitis (and abdominal pain) can be reduced or avoided. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with FCS are on strict dietary fat restriction. Traditional lipid-lowering medications used to 
treat hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), such as fibrates, statins and fish oils, niacin (not registered anymore 
in EU) and off-label lomitapide are only minimally effective in patients with FCS. Gene therapy 
(Glybera (INN:alipogene tiparvovec)) was approved for FCS patients but restricted to those with LPL 
deficiency, who suffer from severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks and detectable levels of LPL protein 
with a genetic confirmed testing. However, this product has been withdrawn from use in the European 
Union since October 2017 following the marketing authorisation holder’s decision not to apply for a 
renewal. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Volanesorsen has been investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week phase 
3 study in 66 patients with FCS (Study CS6). Patients were selected based on genetic testing, TG 
levels (mean of 2209 (SD 1199) mg/ml at baseline) and FCS disease complications. 75.8% of patients 
having a history of acute pancreatitis, 76% with confirmed mutations in type 1 LPL gene mutations and 
55% patients tested post heparin plasma LPL activity of ≤ 20% of normal. Also, genetic abnormal 
phenotypes of other genes related to LPL function (APOC2, LMF1, APOA5, and GPIHBP1) were 
identified.  
Volanesorsen 300 mg was administered once a week, with the opportunity to reduce dose to biweekly 
for patients experiencing platelet decreases. A protocol amendment was introduced during the trial, 
after two serious cases of thrombocytopenia occurred. A dosing algorithm based on thrombocyte levels 
was introduced that described dose adjustments up to a dose interruption for a maximum of 52 weeks. 
The primary endpoint was TG reduction after 3 months of treatment. Important secondary endpoints 
included maintenance of effect on TG levels until 12 months and the occurrence of acute pancreatitis 
and abdominal pain, amongst some others. All dose adjustments occurred after 3 Months of treatment.  
Volanesorsen was further investigated in a supportive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
26-week phase 3 study in 113 patients with high TG levels (1261 mg/dL; 7 were FCS,). Volanesorsen 
300 mg was administered once a week for a maximum of 26 weeks, with all patients reduced to 
biweekly dosing after 13 weeks of treatment after a dose algorithm that was also introduced during 
this study. The primary endpoint was TG reduction after 3 months of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 110/121 
 
 
 
 
 
An open-label single arm study including FCS patients from both studies above is ongoing (Study CS7).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A triglyceride lowering effect was demonstrated in the pivotal study during the first 3 months. In the 
pivotal study CS6 in FCS patients (n=66), volanesorsen demonstrated a substantial 77% reduction in 
TG levels (2267 mg/dL to 590 mg/dL) compared to an increase of 18% with placebo, resulting in a 
94% difference at month 3 (p<0.0001). In the volanesorsen group 77% of patients achieved target TG 
levels of < 750 mg/dL versus only 10% in the placebo group. 
A trend of reduced events of acute pancreatitis in patients treated with volanesorsen was observed (1 
event compared to 4 in placebo treated patients. 
Treatment with volanesorsen also resulted in favourable outcomes in other lipid parameters including 
chylomicron-TG, ApoC-III, ApoB-48, VLDL-C and non-HDL-C and HDL-C.  
TG levels in patients in the supportive study CS16  were reduced by 72% from baseline (TG of 1183 
mg/dL to 294 mg/dL) in the volanesorsen group compared to 3% in the placebo group after 3 months 
(difference of 69% (p<0.0001)). 
The limited open-label data demonstrate a maintenance of effect with percent change in fasting TG 
from baseline to 18 months total (n=9) and 24 months (n=3) of -53.1% and -60.8%.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the pivotal study CS6, the TG lowering effect decreased over time, partially at least due to the 
introduction of dose interruptions and dose adjustments. The TG-lowering effect was diminished from -
77% to -53% (6 months) and -40% (12 months) from baseline. The percentage of patients reaching 
target levels (< 750 mg/dL) was also reduced at these time points (77%, 47% and 37% in the 
volanesorsen group vs 10%, 0% and 6.5% in the placebo group). Smaller TG reductions were 
observed in patients who had their dose adjusted (n=13; -52% and -57% after 6 and 12 months) 
versus those without dose adjustments (n=6; - 80% and -76% after 6 and 12 months) with fewer 
patients achieving TG values of < 750 mg/dL after 12 months of treatment, 46.2% vs 60% on 300 mg 
weekly dose.  
The results on clinically relevant endpoints of acute pancreatitis favoured volanesorsen but very few 
cases were observed. This was further supported by exploratory data in patients who had prior 
frequent acute pancreatitis events (pre-treatment 7 patients, 24 events with 0 on-treatment in 
volanesorsen; pre-treatment 4 patients, 17 events with 3 patients, 4 events on-treatment in placebo; 
p=0.0242). The incidence of pancreatitis in volanesorsen-treated patients in the combined Study CS6 
and Study CS7 (including exposure from Study CS6) was 0.03 events per patient-year, compared to 
0.13 events per patient-year in the placebo group of Study CS6.  
However, no impact on other clinical (secondary) endpoints (abdominal pain, quality of life) was 
observed in study CS6. Abdominal pain was observed in 15 patients (46%) treated with volanesorsen 
and 14 patients (42%) with placebo; and with a similar overall mean maximum abdominal pain 
intensity score (0.38 vs 0.36). Also, for the combined endpoint of adjudicated acute pancreatitis and/or 
moderate/severe abdominal pain on treatment no clear difference was shown (12 (36%) patients in 
the volanesorsen group and 13 (39%) patients in the placebo group). However, fewer patients in the 
volanesorsen group (5 [15%]) reported severe abdominal pain events in comparison with the placebo 
group (8 [24%]), but not for moderate abdominal pain (6 [18%] vs 5 [15%]).  
The long-term efficacy potential of volanesorsen for every FCS patient is uncertain. A large proportion 
of patients discontinued treatment in study CS6 primarily due to AEs, but several patients also 
discontinued on their own volition during treatment and post-treatment follow-up. This could be 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 111/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated with the burden of the need for frequent platelet monitoring. Moreover, only 42% of 
patients treated with volanesorsen in study CS6 were enrolled in the open label extension study CS7 
and in which discontinuation rates remained high. 
A limited number of FCS patients ≥ 65 years of age was included (5 patients (7.6%)). These limited 
data show a similar efficacy in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared with patients ≤ 65 years of age.  
Similar to the pivotal study in the supportive study CS16, a lower efficacy was shown for patients with 
post 13 weeks dose adjustment (n=50; TG -62%) to every 2 weeks compared to the TG reduction for 
patients on 300 mg once weekly (n=25; TG -78%). Further, exploratory data in study CS16 on 
pancreatitis events also showed a similar trend as in the pivotal study with none occurring in 
volanesorsen treated patients vs 5 events in 3 patients in placebo; p=0.036. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal study CS6, a high frequency of injection site reactions (lasting > 2 days) was observed 
for volanesorsen (61%) vs none in placebo, with none being severe. The injection site reactions 
occurred mostly in the first 13 weeks of therapy. 
Volanesorsen treatment was frequently associated with a decrease in platelet counts (68% vs 15% in 
FCS patients for volanesorsen vs placebo (any 2 occurrences of platelet count < 140,000/mm3)). 
Although most thrombocytopenias were mild or moderate in severity they frequently led to 
discontinuation of study treatment (15% (n=5) in study CS6 - 9% (n=6) in study CS7). 
Thrombocytopenia occurred already after start of treatment but more often later between day 99 and 
344. Moreover, dose reductions to every 2 weeks (10 (30%) volanesorsen in study CS6) and dose 
interruptions (11 (33%) volanesorsen group versus 6 (18%) placebo) were frequently needed (a dose 
algorithm and monitoring rules were introduced during the study at 13 weeks). Only 6 (out of 33) 
volanesorsen treated patients in study CS6 completed the study without dose adjustments. Severe 
drops in platelet counts are observed (2 patients before dose algorithm implementation, 4 during the 
open-label study CS7 after implementation), all leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Bleeding events were also commonly reported (49% vs 12% of the patients with approximately 3 
events vs 1 event per patient), most occurred after < 13 weeks of treatment, but none were severe. 
Approximately half of them occurred at the injection site. A very limited number of flu-like symptoms 
occurred (observed with previous antisense oligonucleotides) with 2 patients in study CS6 with 
influenza-like illness. Other frequently reported AEs (excluding AEs at injection site) were headache 
(21% volanesorsen  vs 15% placebo), nasopharyngitis (15% vs 21%), fatigue (21% volanesorsen vs 
9% placebo), erythema (18% vs 9%), and nausea (18% vs 6%), amongst others.  
In the supportive study CS16 similar safety issues were observed as in the pivotal study CS6.  In study 
CS16, also a higher frequency of injection site reactions was observed for volanesorsen vs placebo 
(96% vs 32%), which led to a high frequency of discontinuation of study treatment (9 patients (12%)) 
than in study CS6. Further, 21 patients (28%) in the volanesorsen group vs 4 patients (11%) in the 
placebo group experienced platelet count decreases (any 2 occurrences of platelet count < 
140,000/mm3), which led to discontinuation of study treatment of one patient (1,3%). Likewise to 
study CS6, a higher frequency in bleeding events was observed for volanesorsen compared with 
placebo (28% vs 16%). 
Compared to study CS6, as of December 2017, in the ongoing open-label study CS7, a lower number 
of discontinuations of 27% in treatment naïve patients (n=50), and 35% in previous volanesorsen 
treated patients was observed (n=14). For the treatment naïve patients a lower number of voluntary 
withdrawals were observed 10% (n=5), and 12% (n=6) discontinued due to AEs, 3 due to severe 
thrombocytopenia and 3 due to other AEs. However, as of June 2018, a higher discontinuation rate of 
18 patients (27%) who discontinued (25% potentially related to study drug) due to an adverse event

was observed, while overall discontinuation rates remain unknown and likely further increase the 
overall discontinuation rate.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The mild likely dose dependent (and possible weight dependent) thrombocytopenia appears reasonably 
well managed with dose reductions, dose interruptions and platelet monitoring. Those patients 
completing the one-year period (of whom 13 completed the study period on a every 2-week dosing 
schedule) platelet levels could be stabilised/maintained reasonably within the 100-140.000/mm3 range 
with some occasionally dropping to the 75000/mm3 level or slightly below. However, the alternative 
implemented dosing algorithm was not able to prevent some sudden severe drops in platelet counts (4 
during the open-label study CS7 after implementation of the new dosing algorithm).  None of the 
severe reductions in platelet counts were associated with major or severe bleeding, although non-
major bleedings (single events of hemorrhage and epistaxis) were observed. It is not clear whether 
reductions in platelet counts in real life could result in bleeding events.  
The complicated dosing algorithm and cumbersome platelet monitoring could potentially lead to 
compliance issues, despite the motivation of FCS patients due to the severe complications of this 
disease. Adherence to clinical recommendations and characterisation of incidence and clinical 
consequences of thrombocytopenia will be monitored in a post-authorisation safety study. 
There is some discrepancy between the number of discontinuations due to decreased platelet counts or 
injection site reactions between studies CS6 and CS16. In the pivotal study CS6 most discontinuations 
were due to AE of platelet count decreased (15% (n=5) in study CS6, 1.3% (n=1) in study CS16) 
while in study CS16 patients discontinued treatment primarily due to injection site reactions (3% 
(n=1) in study CS6 and 12% (n=9) in study CS16). Patients in study CS6 are likely to be more 
symptomatic and consequently have a greater motivation to continue the study, which may explain 
this difference. 
Few cases of increase in creatinine were observed (3 patients (2 on study treatment) in study CS6 and 
CS16). Some patients in study CS6 and CS16 with increases in ALT or AST levels were also observed. 
Liver toxicity has been observed previously for oligonucleotides. Patients who tested positive for 
antidrug-antibodies (ADA) were frequent (30% in study CS6 (vs 3% placebo and 16% in study CS16 
(vs 5% placebo)). The clinical data did not show any differences in safety profile or TG level 
reductions. Immunogenicity will be monitored as part of the imposed PASS. 
Volanesorsen, like other ASOs, accumulates in renal tissue and renal inflammatory effects have 
previously been associated with oligonucleotides. Liver toxicity has also been observed previously for 
oligonucleotides. Given the known class effects of ASOs and the limited databases available, any 
potential risk of hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity cannot be excluded. Frequent monitoring is proposed 
in the SmPC and these risks will be prospectively assessed this in the post-marketing setting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with volanesorsen (Waylivra) is targeted at patients with familial chylomicronemia 
syndrome (FCS). These patients have extremely high levels of TG (and chylomicrons) which are 
associated with several clinical symptoms including abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis. It is 
believed that TG levels below a threshold of approximately 10 mmol/L ((880 mg/dL); ESC guideline) 
will reduce these events of acute pancreatitis. 
Volanesorsen treatment demonstrated a clear significant reduction on TG levels even below the 
threshold levels for risk of acute pancreatitis. Current studies (52 weeks for the pivotal study in FCS 
patients and 26 weeks for the high TG level patients) were most likely too small and too short to draw 
a firm conclusion on clinically relevant endpoints such as reduction in pancreatitis. Evaluation of the 
long term treatment effect is further compounded by the large number of patients who discontinued 
treatment as a result of tolerability issues. However, some trend towards an effect could be shown on 
the very limited number observed for acute pancreatitis. The Ad-Hoc Expert Advisory Group also 
considered that the pharmacodynamic effect of volanesorsen on serum triglyceride levels is of clinical 
relevance, despite the limited available data on pancreatitis. 
Treatment with volanesorsen is clearly associated with reduced platelet counts which after the 
occurrence of 2 serious cases of thrombocytopenia in the clinical trials, led to a strict dose and 
monitoring algorithm in both phase 3 studies. Following implementation of this dose algorithm after 3

months, many dose reductions and dose interruptions were needed, which diminished the anticipated 
efficacy, but a substantial TG lowering effect was still maintained. Although the dose algorithm and 
intense platelet monitoring appears to keep the platelet levels reasonably within a slightly lower than 
normal range, several cases of unpredictable severe thrombocytopenia in some of the patients could 
not be prevented. Also, in terms of treatment management the need for frequent platelet monitoring 
and subsequent dose amendments and dose pauses is complex and can be a large burden to patients 
and related health care systems. Several patients appear to have discontinued Volanesorsen because 
of this, despite the lack of an alternative to control their disease.   
Additionally, injection site reactions occurred frequently and also resulted in discontinuations, although 
these occurred early after start of treatment and thus already could select out patients intolerable to 
antisense oligonucleotide treatment of volanesorsen. Bleeding events were also observed, but appear 
mainly associated to the injection site reaction while currently not being observed in the severe 
thrombocytopenia cases. Effects on kidney and liver are known for ASOs and its mechanism of action 
may lead to accumulation in the kidney and liver.  
Current data are limited to one year but further information on the impact of the proposed dosing 
algorithm to minimise the risk of thrombocytopenia, and the other risks associated with volanesorsen 
treatment will be evaluated through a PASS based on a registry. Additional long term safety data will 
continue to be provided as part of the long term follow-up of patients though the registry. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Volanesorsen can reduce TG levels to a considerable extent. Even though not demonstrated, it is 
expected that this will translate into fewer pancreatitis and abdominal pain events. Furthermore, there 
is a rare but serious risk for severe thrombocytopenia with the potential of severe bleeding events. A 
complex mitigation strategy of intense platelet monitoring and dose algorithm including dose 
adjustments and dose pauses is needed to keep the platelet levels within an acceptable range and to 
be able to timely identify serious thrombocytopenia events. Patients at risk of serious 
thrombocytopenia cannot be identified a-priori.  
Taken together, the CHMP considered that the indication of volanesorsen should be restricted to those 
patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk of pancreatitis in whom response to diet and 
triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the new dosing algorithm and its effect on the risk of thrombocytopenia and 
the efficacy of the product in clinical practice are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation 
was proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating nature of 
the disease and is designated as an orphan medicinal product.    
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. It is currently not known 
Assessment report  
EMA/180717/2019  
Page 115/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whether the proposed dosing recommendations and platelet monitoring will be adhered to in 
clinical practice and whether this will be sufficient to effectively manage the risk of 
thrombocytopenia. A synopsis for a study detailing how to address these questions including 
timelines for the completion of this study has been submitted. The CHMP has reviewed this 
proposal and considers that the design of this study is feasible and will likely provide adequate 
information to address its objectives. 
• 
• 
 Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as there are currently no satisfactory treatments in this 
indication. 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. The demonstrated substantial reduction in levels of 
triglyceride, which is expected to lead in a reduction on the incidence of potentially life-
threatening pancreatitis, and the lack of any other approved therapeutic option in this condition 
outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of WAYLIVRA is positive. 
Divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP did not conclude on the similarity of Waylivra to Glybera, as the Marketing Authorisation of 
Glybera expired during the evaluation procedure of Waylivra. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of WAYLIVRA is favourable in the following indication: 
adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) 
and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been 
inadequate. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 February 2019 
WAYLIVRA EMEA/H/C/004538/0000 
The  undersigned  member(s)  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  positive  opinion 
recommending the granting of the marketing authorisation of Waylivra in the following indication:  
Waylivra  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  diet  in  adult  patients  with  genetically  confirmed  familial 
chylomicronemia  syndrome  (FCS)  and  at  high  risk  for  pancreatitis,  in  whom  response  to  diet  and 
triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. 
The reasons for divergent opinion are the following: 
Whilst a large effect of Waylivra on triglycerides (TG) levels in patients with familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) was observed at month 3, a benefit in clinical outcomes of 
interest like abdominal pain, pancreatitis and quality of life, has not been shown in the clinical trials. 
The effect on TG levels decreased over time likely due to the dose adjustment for safety concerns. 
Few FCS patients were exposed to Waylivra but a number of adverse events were reported, like 
local tolerability events (including skin discoloration), reduction in platelet count, bleeding events, 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea. The sudden and unexpected severe drops in platelet count 
observed in some patients after the implementation of the dose adjustment in the clinical study are 
particularly worrying and suggest that the proposed dose adjustment and the intensive monitoring 
cannot avoid the platelet fall and its potential clinical consequences. This together with the 
uncertainties related to the long-term administration of Waylivra are of relevance considering the 
lifelong nature of this treatment. 
Taking all these aspects into account, the benefit risk balance of Waylivra is considered negative. 
There are doubts that the proposed PASS can solve the uncertainties previously mentioned.

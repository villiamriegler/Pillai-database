Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for POMALIDOMIDE, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The MAH retrieved 56 arterial thrombotic events from their safety database, including 11 reports with 
a fatal outcome. The most common clinical presentation of arterial thrombotic events was myocardial 
infarction (n=32). Of these cases, 26 occurred within 12 months (including 15 that occurred within 3 
months of starting pomalidomide). In addition, pomalidomide inhibits angiogenesis, a 
pharmacodynamic effect which is known to increase the risk of arterial thrombotic events. Based on 
the available data it has been concluded that a causal association between myocardial infarction and 
pomalidomide cannot be excluded and therefore the risk of myocardial infarction should be included in 
the product information.  
A cumulative review of cerebrovascular accidents identified 113 events, of which 81 could be classified 
as ischaemic (n=31) or haemorrhagic (n=50). Where a causality assessment was provided, half of the 
ischaemic cerebrovascular accident events were judged as related to pomalidomide. Furthermore 14 
cerebrovascular accident events included cases of cerebral haemorrhage and 25 included cases with 
subdural haemorrhage, subdural haematoma or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Therefore the risk of 
cerebrovascular accident and intracranial haemorrhage should be included in the product information. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding pomalidomide, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for POMALIDOMIDE the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing POMALIDOMIDE is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

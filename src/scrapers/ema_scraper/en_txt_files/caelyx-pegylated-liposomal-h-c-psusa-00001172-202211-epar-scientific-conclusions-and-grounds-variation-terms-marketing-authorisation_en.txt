Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for doxorubicin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on interstitial lung disease from the literature and spontaneous reports 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and interstitial lung disease is at least a reasonable possibility. The 
PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 
should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for doxorubicin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing doxorubicin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

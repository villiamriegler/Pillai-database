Brief description of the 
product
Chemical class: Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
Summary of mode of action: 
Lenvatinib is an oral, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase 
(RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities 
of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1 
[FLT1], VEGFR2 [KDR], and VEGFR3 [FLT4]), in 
addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-
related RTKs, including fibroblast growth factor receptors 
(FGFR) 1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet-derived growth factor 
receptor α (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET.  In addition, 
lenvatinib had selective, direct antiproliferative activity in 
hepatocellular cell lines dependent on activated FGFR 
signalling, attributed to the inhibition of FGFR signalling by 
lenvatinib.  The dual VEGF and FGFR inhibition seen with 
lenvatinib results in potent inhibition of angiogenesis and 
direct antitumour activity.
In syngeneic mouse tumour models, lenvatinib decreased 
tumour-associated macrophages, increased activated 
cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumour 
activity in combination with an anti-programmed cell death 
protein-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody compared to either 
treatment alone.
The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus showed 
increased antiangiogenic and antitumour activity as 
demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell 
proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signalling in vitro

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Epidemiology of the Disease:  
There are 3 main histologic types of thyroid cancer: differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), 
arising from follicular epithelial cells (including papillary thyroid cancer [PTC], follicular 
thyroid cancer, and Hürthle cell thyroid carcinomas), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and 
anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).  Approximately 90% to 95% of thyroid cancers arise from 
follicular epithelial cells and, based on histologic appearance, are designated as either 
papillary (approximately 80%), follicular (approximately 13%), or Hürthle cell 
(approximately 3%), as subtypes of DTC (Hundahl, et al., 1998).  The remaining 5% to 10% 
of thyroid cancers are either neuroendocrine-derived MTC or ATC.  
Incidence:
According to the European Union Cancer Database (EUCAN, 2012), 36,864 new cases of 
thyroid cancer (6.5 per 100,000) were estimated in the EU in 2012; GLOBOCAN estimated 
37,282 new cases in 2012 (including those from Croatia).  Incidence rates in individual 
member states range from 1.9 to 15.5 cases per 100,000 individuals across the EU, with the 
highest rates (those above 9/100,000) reported in Lithuania, Italy, Austria, Croatia, 
Luxembourg, Cyprus, and France (Figure 1) (EUCAN, 2012).
Incidence rates for the histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer are available from 
RARECARE (2014), which estimates rates of 2.05 and 0.57 per 100,000 for the papillary and 
follicular subtypes, respectively, and a rate of 3.65 per 100,000 for thyroid cancer as a whole.  
These estimates are for the year 2008 based on cases that occurred in the EU in the period 
1995-2002, collated from 70 registries across Europe.  RARECARE (2014) population 
numbers, thus, report DTC to be 87% of the total thyroid cancer population, which is 
consistent with the proportion of 90% cited by Cancer Research UK (2014).
An escalating incidence of DTC during the last decade has been reported worldwide.  
NORDCAN (2014) reports an annual increase in incidence over the last decade of +3.4% in 
men and +3.2% in women.  This phenomenon is due mainly to an increase in the 
micropapillary (<2 cm) histotype, while there has been no substantial change in the incidence 
of follicular, medullary, and anaplastic cancers according to the European Society of Medical 
Oncology (Pacini, et al., 2012).  Agate, et al. (2012) suggested that this "over-diagnosis" of 
small cancers that would have previously remained occult has been revealed because of an 
increased diagnostic scrutiny rather than a real increase of incidence.

Estimated Incidence of Thyroid Cancer in Both Sexes in the EU, 
2012
Key:  Age-standardized incidence rate per 100,000.
Source:  EUCAN, Thyroid Cancer Fact Sheet, 2012.
Prevalence:
The 5-year prevalence estimate for thyroid cancer as a whole was 149,044 adult individuals 
(aged greater than 15 years) within the EU in 2012, including 110,661 females and 38,383 
males (GLOBOCAN, 2012; EUCAN, 2012).  Extrapolation of this figure to 2014, 
accounting for a decline in female mortality of 2.3% per year (NORDCAN, 2014) and an 
overall population increase in the EU of 0.4% (Eurostat), results in a 5-year prevalence 
estimate of 149,638 persons living with thyroid cancer in the EU in 2014. 
Neither RARECARE nor GLOBOCAN provide information on the subset of patients with 
RAI-refractory DTC; hence, an estimate of 5-year prevalence for this subgroup has been 
calculated based on the following assumptions:
• DTC comprises approximately 90% of cases of thyroid cancer (RARECARE, 2008;
Cancer Research UK, 2014).
• The disease recurs within 5 years in approximately 10% of DTC patients (Mazzaferri and
Kloos, 2001).

•
28% to 40% of patients with metastatic thyroid cancers lose functional ability to
concentrate iodine and for whom radioiodine treatment is no longer appropriate
(Schlumberger, et al., 1986; Schlumberger, et al., 1996; Samaan et al., 1985; Durante, et
al., 2006).
If these estimates are taken together and applied to the 2014 prevalence estimate for thyroid 
cancer, then the 5-year prevalence of RAI-refractory DTC was approximately 4938 persons 
in the EU in 2014.
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
No specific demographic data for the RAI-refractory DTC population have been reported; 
therefore, information in this section is presented for thyroid cancer as a whole (and DTC 
where available).
The median age of individuals at the time of diagnosis of thyroid cancer (as a whole) is 
between 45 and 50 years (Agate, et al., 2012; SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 2014).  
Patients with follicular thyroid cancer tend to be older than those with PTC and to have a 
more advanced tumour stage at diagnosis (Mazzaferri and Kloos, 2001).  Thyroid cancer is 
rare in individuals <16 years of age, with an annual incidence of between 0.02 and 0.7 cases 
per 100,000 children and it is exceptional before the age of 10 (Agate, et al., 2012; Holmes, 
et al., 2012). 
Female subjects represent 73% of the thyroid cancer population in Scandinavian countries 
(including Iceland and Faroe Islands) (NORDCAN, 2014).  In the UK, female subjects 
represent 71% of the population with an incidence of 2.2 and 5.5 per 100,000 in male and 
female subjects, respectively (UK Office of National Statistics).  A higher incidence in 
female subjects is also observed in the US (SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 2014).  
No racial differences in the incidence of thyroid cancer are clearly defined or reported within 
Europe.  In the US, there is evidence of racial differences in the incidence of PTC, which 
occurs more frequently among Asian female (10.96/100,000) than in black female subjects 
(4.9/100,000), and higher in white male (3.58/100,000) than in black male subjects 
(1.56/100,000) (Pacini, et al., 2012; SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 2014).  The incidence of 
other subtypes does not appear to vary substantially by race or ethnicity (Aschebrook-Kilfoy, 
et al., 2011).  The Asian populations of Europe do not account for sufficient proportions of 
the population to influence underlying rates.
The only established environmental risk factor for thyroid carcinoma is exposure to ionizing 
radiation, and the risk, particularly of PTC, is greater in subjects of younger age at exposure 
(Pacini, et al., 2012).
The main existing treatment options:
Single-agent or combination chemotherapy in RAI-refractory DTC offers patients little to no 
benefit and is associated with significant toxicity (Shimaoka, et al., 1985; Matuszczyk, et al., 
2008).  The lack of benefit of chemotherapy, associated with substantial cytotoxicity, is 
Eisai

addressed in consensus guidelines by the European Society of Medical Oncology and the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN; Tuttle, et al., 2010; Pacini, et al., 2012).  
These guidelines recommend that patients with RAI-refractory DTC avoid traditional 
chemotherapy and move directly to treatment with antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs).  Several TKIs are under clinical development and one TKI, sorafenib, was approved 
for RAI-refractory DTC in the US in November 2013 and in the EU in May 2014.  
Physicians have begun to expand their use of TKIs as data on the efficacy in patients with 
RAI-refractory DTC become available.
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
The prognosis for thyroid cancer at the time of diagnosis is generally good, with a 5-year 
relative survival rate of 98% (SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 2014) and a 10-year survival 
rate of 85% (Hundahl, et al., 1998).  
Differentiated thyroid cancer is usually asymptomatic for long periods and commonly 
presents as a solitary thyroid nodule.  The current treatment of choice for primary 
management of DTC is surgery (total thyroidectomy or unilateral lobectomy), commonly 
followed by 131I ablation and thyroxine therapy (Pacini, et al., 2012; NCCN Practice 
Guidelines, Version 2.2013).  The goal of this treatment is to destroy any residual thyroid 
tissue and prevent locoregional recurrence.  Mazzaferri and Kloos (2001) reported tumour 
recurrence in 23.5% of DTC patients at the 16.6 year median follow-up time for the study; 
16% had local recurrence and 8% had distant metastases (which includes 2% with both local 
and distant metastases).  After a 40-year follow-up, the recurrence rate was approximately 
35%, a third of which were distant metastases.  Distant metastases are associated with 5-year 
survival rates of approximately 50% (Schlumberger, et al., 1986; SEER Cancer Statistics 
Review, 2014), 10-year survival rates of 40% (Schlumberger, et al., 1986), and 15 year 
survival rates of 30% (Schlumberger, et al., 1986; Schlumberger, et al., 1996).  
The main predictors of outcome for patients with distant metastases are age, metastatic site, 
the ability of the tumour to concentrate 131I, and morphology on a chest radiograph 
(Schlumberger, et al., 1986).  Approximately one-third of metastatic thyroid cancers lose 
functional ability to concentrate iodine and will no longer be appropriate for RAI treatment 
(Schlumberger, et al., 1996; Durante, et al., 2006).  Once becoming refractory to RAI, DTC 
exhibits a more aggressive behaviour.  The absence or loss of 131I uptake in tumours 
correlates with a 10-year survival rate of approximately 10% (Schlumberger, et al., 1996; 
Durante, et al., 2006).  
Important co-morbidities:
An observational study revealed that of 29,225 patients with thyroid cancer (90% of whom 
had DTC), 2.7% died from thyroid cancer, 1.8% from other cancers, and 3.5% from other 
non-cancer causes (Yang, et al., 2013).  The most frequent causes of non-cancer death were 
heart diseases (33.9%), cerebrovascular diseases (10.4%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and associated conditions (5.7%).  The most frequent secondary cancer deaths were

due to cancers of the lung and bronchus (22.6%), colon excluding rectum (6.3%), pancreas 
(5.9%), and breast (5.2%). 
In a population-based study of 378 DTC patients in the Netherlands, hypertension was the 
most frequent comorbidity (18%) and was twice as high as expected (Kuijpens, et al., 2006) 
compared with patients with other cancer types in the same region (Janssen-Heijnen, et al., 
2005).  
In a retrospective cohort study in the Netherlands comparing 524 patients with DTC and 
1572 sex and age–matched controls, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were more common 
in DTC patients than in controls (17.7% versus 11.5%) and (4.2% versus 2.5%), respectively 
(Klein Hesselink, et al., 2013).  This study also showed that the risk of cardiovascular (CV)
mortality is increased 3.3 fold in patients with DTC compared with controls, independent of 
age, sex, and CV risk factors, and that lower thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were 
independently associated with an increased risk of CV mortality.  The authors suggested that 
the increased CV risk may be due to long-term exposure to thyroid hormone suppression 
therapy rather than the underlying disease.

Incidence:
Worldwide, kidney cancer is the 14th most common cancer, and is the 9th most frequently 
diagnosed cancer in men and 14th in women (World Cancer Research Fund, 2020).  The 
incidence of RCC is increasing and it is estimated that in 2021, 76,080 (48,780 male and 
27,300 female) new cases of kidney cancer will be diagnosed in the US.  Approximately 
13,780 people are expected to die from the disease in the US (American Cancer Society, 
2021).  In 2020, an estimated 138,611 new cases of kidney cancer were expected to be 
diagnosed in Europe with approximately 54,054 people expected to die from the disease 
(GLOBOCAN, 2020).
The age-standardised incidence of kidney cancer (per 100,000) is highest in North America 
(10.9) and Northern Europe (10.0); rates are lowest in Middle Africa (0.87; Ferlay et al., 
2018).  More than one-third of incident cases occur in Europe, with nearly 137,000 incident 
cases expected in 2018 (Ferlay et al., 2018).  In the US, kidney cancer incidence is 16.1 per 
100,000, yielding roughly 74,000 new cases in 2019 (SEER*Stat, 2019).
Prevalence:
The 5-year prevalence of kidney cancer in Europe (Central and Eastern Europe, Northern 
Europe, Southern Europe and Western Europe) in 2018 was 382,191, while the total 
population was 922,832,486 individuals (GLOBOCAN, 2020), leading to a prevalence of 
kidney cancer in Europe of 41.4/100,000.  This prevalence is in line with the prevalence for

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
RCC of 42.0/100,000, as published in the most recent Orphanet Report Series (Orphanet 
Report Series, 2021).
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a male-predominant disease and in most countries, it is 
roughly twice as common among males compared to females.  Kidney cancer incidence 
increases with age, and typically presents in the sixth and seventh decades of life (median age 
about 60 years; Escudier and Kataja, 2010; Ferlay et al., 2018; SEER*Stat, 2019).  
Incidences in Europe and the US increase consistently with age, with a plateau reached 
around ages 70 to 75 years (Ljungberg, et al., 2011).  RCC is rare in children, accounting for 
approximately 0.1% to 0.3% of all neoplasms and from 1.8% to 6.3% of all malignant renal 
tumours, and has shown significant differences in histology and pathogenesis when 
compared to RCC in adults (Perlman, 2010; Indolfi, et al., 2003).
Incidence of RCC seems to be substantially lower among Asians, both in most Asian 
countries and in the US, suggesting a higher risk of RCC among whites compared to Asians.  
The lowest incidences have been reported from African countries.  However, the incidence is 
highest among African Americans in the US.  Racial disparities in incidence may be 
attributable to differences in frequency of diagnostic imaging, access to health care, genetic 
background, and prevalence of lifestyle or environmental risk factors (Ljungberg, et al., 
2011).
Established risk factors for RCC include obesity, smoking, hypertension, and chronic kidney 
disease; other probable risk factors include low physical activity, diabetes, occupational 
chemical exposure, radiation exposure, and analgesic use (Capitanio et al., 2019; Petejova, 
2016; Rossi, 2018).  However, antihypertensive medications such as diuretics are not 
independently associated with RCC development.  RCC also appears to be more common in 
patients with end-stage renal failure, acquired renal cystic disease and tuberous sclerosis 
(Escudier, et al., 2014). 
Renal cell cancer generally is not considered an occupational disease, although there is 
epidemiologic evidence linking trichloroethylene exposure to RCC, with most recent studies 
reporting increased risk with increased exposure (Chow, et al., 2010).
Approximately 2% to 3% of RCC are hereditary and several autosomal dominant syndromes 
are described, each with a distinct genetic basis and phenotype, the most common one being 
Von Hippel Lindau disease (Escudier, et al., 2014).
The main existing treatment options:
Renal cell carcinoma generally resists both traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
Surgical resection can be curative for patients presenting with localized disease.  Of patients 
with localised RCC treated with nephrectomy with curative intent, approximately one quarter 
relapse at distant sites.  The prognosis in these cases is poor (Choueiri and Motzer, 2017).  
However, one third of patients present with regional or distant metastases.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Advances in understanding of the pathogenesis and molecular biology of RCC led to a shift 
from predominantly cytokine-based treatment options to the use of targeted agents.
Current strategies for optimizing treatment of advanced disease have focused on the 
development of new therapeutic agents and optimal sequencing of drugs.  One challenge is 
that multiple overlapping and complementary angiogenic and oncogenic signaling pathways 
can provide tumours with potential evasive resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy.  
Combinations of agents may overcome the resistance that develops with single-agent therapy 
hence, novel strategies include new combinations of agents to maximize their impact on 
clinical outcomes.  Since 2017, several immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations have 
demonstrated a survival advantage in advanced RCC and globally approved 1L therapy has 
changed to include nivolumab plus ipilimumab (for intermediate or poor risk disease by 
IMDC risk model), axitinib plus avelumab, axitinib plus pembrolizumab, and cabozantinib 
plus nivolumab.  All the pivotal studies that support these indications included sunitinib as 
the comparator arm, since sunitinib was standard of care at that time.  Despite the increase in
active systemic treatments available to advanced RCC patients, most patients with advanced 
disease will progress or die within 1.5 years (median PFS 5.5 to 16.6 months for currently 
approved 1L therapies).  Therefore, more effective therapies in 1L RCC are needed.
Despite significant progress, treatment of advanced RCC after disease progression with anti-
PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, remains a challenge given the lack of established treatment options.  
However, the response rate with initial targeted therapy is approximately 30% and nearly all 
patients who do respond eventually progress.  This is evidenced by the lack of specific 
guidance available for patients who previously received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in 
guidelines, where many regimens include an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.  Data for all second-
line regimens after an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is generally retrospective and has not shown 
strong efficacy in a well-defined population (NCCN, 2020).  Overall, these limitations 
underscore the high unmet need in advanced RCC patients with progression following 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 based regimen.
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
RCC originates within the renal cortex from the proximal renal tubular epithelium and is the 
most common kidney cancer, constituting 80% to 85% of primary renal neoplasms (Motzer, 
et al., 1996).  Most cases of RCC (70% to 80%) are classified as clear-cell tumours.
One-third of patients present with regional or distant metastases and the 5-year survival rate 
for metastatic disease is approximately 12% (Siegel, et al., 2018). 
Worldwide, kidney cancer age-standardised mortality rates (per 100,000) are highest in 
Central/Eastern Europe (3.6) and Western Europe (3.0); 55,000 deaths occurred in Europe 
during 2018 (Ferlay et al., 2018).  Prognosis has improved significantly in the US and 
Europe, due in part to the advent of TKI therapy and immunotherapy (Mangone, 2017; 
SEER*Stat, 2019).  The majority (65%) of kidney cancers diagnosed in the US is localized 
and 16% of tumours are metastatic (SEER*Stat, 2019).  The overall 5-year survival in 
Europe and the US is 60% and 75%, respectively (SEER*Stat, 2019; Marcos-Gragera, et al., 
Eisai

2015).  Clear cell histology, accounting for the majority of RCC, is associated with a better 
prognosis than non-clear cell RCC (Rao, 2018).
Important co-morbidities:
Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, diabetes and other prevalent comorbidities among elderly populations are frequently 
observed in cancer patients (Sarfati, et al., 2016).
Indication: Hepatocellular carcinoma
Brand Name of Concerned Product (with this Indication): Lenvima
For the purpose of this RMP, the generic name lenvatinib is used in accordance with the 
terminology used in the nonclinical and clinical studies.
Epidemiology of the Disease:  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a tumour of the parenchymal cells of the liver, is the most 
common liver cancer, representing 80% of all tumour histologies.  The second most common 
histology (approximately 15%) is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which arises in the 
cholangiocytes of the intrahepatic bile duct.  Large geographic disparities in incidence and 
mortality of all types of liver cancer exist (McGlynn, et al., 2015).
It is important to distinguish between primary liver cancer and secondary liver cancer, since 
the liver is a common site of metastatic spread in other tumour types, and in some countries, 
mortality can appear to be even higher than incidence as secondary liver cancer can be 
mistakenly counted as primary liver cancer (McGlynn, et al., 2015).
Incidence:
Primary liver cancer is the fifth most commonly occurring cancer worldwide in men, the 
ninth most common cancer in women, and the second most common cause of cancer 
mortality worldwide, estimated to be responsible for 782,000 new cases and nearly 746,000 
deaths in 2012 (9.1% of the total) (GLOBOCAN, 2012).  The incidence of liver cancer is 
highly variable on a geographic basis, with the highest incidence rates associated with the 
less developed regions, where 83% of the total number of cases occurred (50% of cases in 
China alone).
Rates vary substantially worldwide.  Among men, liver cancer incidence rates in 2012 (cases 
per 100,000) ranged from approximately 4 in Northern Europe and South Central Asia to 32 
in South-Eastern Asia.  Among women the incidence rates ranged from approximately 2 in 
Northern Europe and Micronesia to 10 in Eastern Asia (GLOBOCAN, 2012).
In the EU, the incidence of liver cancer was 51,319 adults in 2012, including 35,564 males 
and 15,755 females (EUCAN, 2012).  Incidence rates ranged from 2.2 to 10.5 cases per 
100,000 individuals across Europe, with the highest rates (≥10/100,000) reported in Italy and

Luxembourg (Figure 2) (EUCAN, 2012).  The incidence of HCC has been rising in a number 
of low-rate areas such as Australia, the UK, and the US.

The 5-year prevalence estimate for liver cancer as a whole was 46,478 adult individuals 
within the EU in 2012, including 32,648 males and 13,832 females (EUCAN, 2012).
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, racial and/or
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Rates of liver cancer are two- to three-fold higher in males compared with females.  
Although the differences in incidence rates by gender are not well understood, it has been 
hypothesized that differences in sex steroid hormones, immune responses and epigenetics 
could be related to the higher rates among men (McGlynn, et al., 2015).
In addition to gender differences, racial/ethnic disparity within multiethnic populations is 
also notable. In the US between 2006 and 2010, Asians/Pacific Islanders had the highest 
incidence rate per 100,000 (11.7), followed by Hispanics (9.5), blacks (7.5), and finally, 
whites (4.2).  Rates of liver cancer among persons of the same ethnicity also vary by 
geographic location.  For example, liver cancer rates among Chinese populations outside 
China are lower than the rates reported by Chinese registries.  As with gender differences, 
racial/ethnic differences are likely due to variability in the prevalence of risk factors between 
racial/ethnic groups and between geographic locations (McGlynn, et al., 2015).
The risk of developing liver cancer increases with advancing age and is more prevalent in 
men than women.  Approximately 90% of HCCs are associated with a known underlying risk 
factor.  The most frequent risk factors include chronic viral hepatitis (types B and C), alcohol 
intake and aflatoxin exposure.  Worldwide, approximately 54% of cases can be attributed to 
with hepatitis B (HBV) infection (which affects 400 million people globally) while 31% can 
be attributed to hepatitis C (HCV) infection (which affects 170 million people), leaving 
approximately 15% associated with other causes (EASL-EORTC, 2012).
Cirrhosis is an important risk factor for HCC, and may be caused by chronic viral hepatitis, 
alcohol, inherited metabolic diseases such as hemochromatosis or alpha-1-antitrypsin 
deficiency, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  Obesity, diabetes and fatty liver disease 
have come to be recognized as a cause of HCC (El-Serag, et al., 2001; Marrero, et al., 2005), 
although the mechanisms by which these overlapping conditions contribute to cancer 
development remain elusive.  Smoking has also been identified as a clear risk factor for 
HCC, with heavy smokers having a higher risk than non-smokers (Marrero, et al., 2005).
The main existing treatment options:
Prior to the introduction of targeted therapies, the outcomes for patients with HCC did not 
improve for many decades despite scientific advances in the understanding of 
hepatocarcinogenesis.  This was due to the advanced stage of the disease at the time of 
clinical presentation and limited therapeutic options (Blum, 2005).
Currently, the only approved first-line systemic treatment for patients with advanced HCC is 
the TKI sorafenib.  It is indicated for patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh 
A class) and with advanced tumours (Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] classification 
C), or those tumours progressing upon loco-regional therapies.  The only second-line 
treatment that has demonstrated efficacy in patients who are intolerant to or have progressed 
on sorafenib is regorafenib, which showed a survival benefit compared with placebo in a 
recently published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (Bruix, et al., 
2017).  Regorafenib is undergoing regulatory submissions globally for second-line treatment, 
but has not currently been approved in Europe, and as a consequence best supportive care or 
the inclusion of patients in clinical trials is recommended in this setting.  In specific 
Eisai

circumstances, radiotherapy can be used to alleviate pain in patients with bone metastasis. 
Patients with BCLC classification D (terminal stage) should receive palliative support 
including management of pain, nutrition and psychological support.  In general, they should 
not be considered for participating in clinical trials (EASL-EORTC, 2012).
Due to the current paucity of treatment options for patients with advanced HCC, a critical 
need exists to develop new agents for the effective management of this disease.
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
In advanced HCC, the prognosis in patients with cancer-related symptoms (symptomatic 
tumours, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 1–2), 
macrovascular invasion (either segmental or portal invasion) or extrahepatic spread (lymph 
node involvement or metastases) is dismal, with expected median survival times of 6 months 
(Llovet and Bruix, 2008; Llovet, et al., 1999), or 25% at 1 year (Cabibbo, et al., 2010).  
Patients with end-stage disease typically have a very poor performance status (ECOG 3–4).  
Their median survival is 3–4 months (Llovet, et al., 1999) or 11% at 1-year (Cabibbo, et al., 
2010).  Similarly, Child–Pugh C patients with tumours beyond the transplantation threshold 
also have a very poor prognosis (EASL-EORTC, 2012).
Hepatocellular carcinoma is frequently complicated by the presence of comorbid conditions, 
which can affect liver function, limit treatment options, and lead to poor outcomes; these 
include cirrhosis, coinfection with HBV or HCV, and diabetes.  Comorbidities associated 
with HCC vary depending on geographic region.  For example, comorbid HBV or HCV 
infections occur more commonly in African and Asian populations, and, although most 
patients (70%-90%) have liver cirrhosis at diagnosis, in Asian populations HCC may develop 
in individuals at a younger age without cirrhosis (Blum, 2005; Marrero, et al., 2010).  
Clinically significant portal hypertension is a common comorbidity in HCC, which occurs in 
25% to 55% of patients with both HCC and cirrhosis.  Portal hypertension correlates with the 
severity of cirrhosis, and it can complicate HCC treatment by increasing the risk of 
perioperative haemorrhage and liver failure (Zhong, et al., 2014).
Important co-morbidities:
There are multiple factors involved in the etiology of HCC, all of which have a direct impact 
on patient characteristics and disease course, and although a causative agent can often be 
identified, HCC remains an extremely complex condition associated with a poor prognosis 
(Sanyal, et al., 2010).
Most patients with HCC have liver cirrhosis, which develops following long periods of 
chronic liver disease.  Cirrhosis is characterized by a decrease in hepatocyte proliferation, 
indicating an exhaustion of the regenerative capacity of the liver, and results in an increase in 
fibrous tissue and a destruction of liver cells, which may ultimately lead to the development 
of cancerous nodules.  Half of all cases of HCC are associated with HBV infection, with a 
further 25% associated with HCV.  Other co-morbidities may include those arising from 
Eisai

other risk factors for developing HCC, such as alcoholic liver disease, diabetes, and obesity 
(Sanyal, et al., 2010).
Indication: Endometrial carcinoma
Brand Name of Concerned Product (with this Indication): Lenvima
For the purpose of this RMP, the generic name lenvatinib is used in accordance with the 
terminology used in the nonclinical and clinical studies.
Epidemiology of the Disease:
Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is the most common histologic 
type of uterine cancer.  Endometrial adenocarcinomas are often classified into 2 histologic 
categories—Type 1 and Type 2.  Type 1 tumours are more common and less aggressive, 
accounting for 70% to 80% of new cases, with endometrioid histology being the most 
common (Kerr, 2017).  In contrast, Type 2 tumours typically have a poorer prognosis and are 
not clearly associated with oestrogen stimulation (Fleming, 2015; Makker, et al., 2017; Tran 
and Gehrig, 2017).  Type 2 tumours consist of higher-grade adenocarcinomas and often have 
non-endometrioid histologies (eg, clear cell and serous cell types).  In the recurrent setting, 
high-grade, aggressive tumours like serous and clear cell become more prevalent 
(Ramondetta, et al., 2001; Slomovitz, et al., 2003; del Carmen, et al., 2012).
A recent finding has been the identification of tumours with shortening or lengthening of 
small repetitive elements in DNA, a condition called microsatellite instability (MSI; Murali, 
et al., 2018).  Microsatellite instability is a result of the inability of DNA mismatch repair 
(MMR) proteins to repair random mutations (termed MMR deficiency [dMMR]), leading to 
tumourigenesis.  The MSI/MMR status is a key component in influencing treatment 
decisions for recurrent endometrial tumours.
Incidence:
Carcinoma of the uterine corpus, often referred as endometrial cancer (EC), is the sixth most 
common cancer among women worldwide with an estimated 382,069 new cases diagnosed in 
2018 (Ferlay, et al., 2018).  The incidence rate of EC is generally higher in high-income 
countries than low- and middle-income countries, with the highest age-standardised 
incidence rate (per 100,000) found in North America (20.5) and the lowest rate in South-
Central Asia (2.5; Ferlay, et al., 2018).  The age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) in the 
EU (EU-28) is 14.3 per 100,000, yielding roughly 78,900 new cases each year (ECIS, 2018).  
Incidence rates of EC have been increasing over the past 2 decades in the US with an age-
adjusted incidence rate of 27.5 per 100,000, corresponding to approximately 61,900 new 
cases (3.5% of all new cancers) annually (Howlader, 2019). 
Prevalence:
Globally, the 5-year prevalence (per 100,000) is the highest in North America (139.9), 
followed by Northern Europe (124.8) and Central and Eastern Europe (121.6); and the lowest 
is in Middle Africa (2.6), Western Africa (3.3), and Eastern Africa (3.5) (Ferlay, et al., 2018).  
Eisai
Page 24 of 163

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Prevalence (per 100,000) varies by region in Europe from 107.0 in Western Europe to 124.8 
in Northern Europe (Ferlay, et al., 2018).  In the US, an estimated 772,245 women were 
living with EC in 2016 (Howlader, 2019).  According to a recent meta-analysis of 53 
publications including over 12,000 patients, the pooled prevalence of MSI-high (MSI-H) and 
dMMR EC tumours is 26% and 25%, respectively (Lorenzi, 2018); therefore, the majority of 
patients will have tumours that are not MSI-H or dMMR.
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication – age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease: 
Endometrial cancer is most frequently diagnosed among women aged 45–74 years with a 
median age at diagnosis of 63 years (Howlader, et al., 2019).  Endometrial cancer incidence 
rate varies by race/ethnicity with the highest incidence rate in White women (28.1 per 
100,000) and the lowest incidence rate in American Indian/Alaska Native women (19.7 per 
100,000) (Howlader, 2019).  On the other hand, Black women (8.5 per 100,000) have the 
highest mortality rate, and Asian/Pacific Islander women (3.1 per 100,000) have the lowest 
mortality rate (Howlader, 2019).  The main risk factors for EC are related to endogenous and 
exogenous oestrogen, including being overweight, abdominal fatness, oestrogen replacement 
therapy, early age at menarche, late menopause, nulliparity and diabetes (Morice, 2016; 
Torre, 2017).
The main existing treatment options:
Treatment of EC may vary depending on the histology, grade, stage of the disease, and the 
MSI/MMR status. Currently, the mainstay of first-line treatment for localized EC is surgery 
with hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy depending on risk factors (Tran and Gehrig, 2017).  Platinum-based 
chemotherapy is the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic, 
recurrent, or high-risk disease (NCCN, 2020).  Some subgroups of patients, based on 
molecular profiling, may benefit less from chemotherapy as suggested by a retrospective 
analysis on the PORTEC-3 study including dMMR tumours that demonstrated worse 
outcomes compared to pMMR tumours (POLE mutated and NSMP) (Prendergast, et al., 
2019).
Cytotoxic therapy remains the de facto second-line treatment, despite limited efficacy and 
substantial toxicities (Makker, et al., 2017) and being associated with low response rates 
(≤15%) and short PFS (4 months), resulting in poor overall survival and quality of life 
(McMeekin, et al., 2015).  Therefore, further development of novel therapies or combinations 
with unequivocal demonstration of rapid disease control, durable clinical benefit and 
prolonged OS in a clinically meaningful number of participants is needed for the treatment of 
advanced EC of both the endometrioid and nonendometrioid (including clear cell and serous 
histologies) and regardless of MMR biomarker status.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Endometrial cancer is the fourteenth leading cause of cancer-related death among women 
worldwide with the age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) of 1.8 per 100,000, 
corresponding to an estimated 89,929 deaths in 2018 (Ferlay, et al., 2018).  The highest 
mortality rate (per 100,000) is observed in Central and Eastern Europe (3.9) and the lowest 
rate is observed in Northern Africa (0.7) (Ferlay, et al., 2018).  Approximately 18,800 
patients die each year from EC in Europe (EU-28) (ECIS, 2018); the ASMR is 2.4 per 
100,000, with the highest rate in Central/Eastern Europe (3.9) and the lowest rate in Western 
Europe (2.1) (ECIS, 2018; Ferlay, et al., 2018). 
The prognosis for EC is significantly influenced by disease stage.  At diagnosis, 67% of 
patients have localized disease, while 21% have regional disease, and approximately 9% 
have distant metastases (Howlader, et al., 2019).  Patients with localised disease have a 5-
year survival rate of 95%, whereas those with regional and distant metastatic disease have 5-
year survival rates of 69% and 16.8%, respectively (Howlader, et al., 2019).  Despite the 
favorable outcomes associated with early detection, approximately 20% of EC cases recur 
with poor outcomes (Suhaimi, et al., 2016).  The population of patients with recurrent EC 
represents a heterogeneous mix of different histological subtypes and grades, stages at initial 
diagnosis, prior therapy, duration of recurrence-free intervals, and site(s) of recurrence 
(distant or local; Obel, et al., 2006).  In general, the prognosis is dismal for women diagnosed 
with advanced or recurrent disease, with a median survival of only 12 months (Makker, et al., 
2017).
Important co-morbidities:
Co-morbidities are common among patients with cancer, particularly with older adults 
(Williams, et al., 2016).  Most cases of EC occur among adults over age 55 and excess 
oestrogen exposure is a well-known risk factor of EC, thus, patients with EC often have 
comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (Cook, et al., 2013; Nicholas, et al., 
2014; Kurnit, et al., 2015).

SPECIFICATION
Key safety findings from nonclinical studies and relevance to human usage:

Single and 
repeat-dose 
toxicity
Key Safety Findings 
Relevance to Human Usage
The toxicity of lenvatinib was evaluated in 
single- and repeated-dose oral toxicity studies 
(for up to 26, 4, or 39 weeks) in male and 
female rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively.
Lenvatinib caused toxicologic changes in 
various organs and tissues in rats, dogs, and 
monkeys.  The majority of the findings were 
related to the pharmacologic effects of 
lenvatinib as a VEGFR RTK inhibitor and its 
antiangiogenic activity in selected tissues.  In 
addition, reversibility of the toxicologic changes 
was indicated at the conclusion of a 4-week off-
dose interval in all animal species investigated.
No abnormalities in mean blood pressure (BP) 
were noted with E7080 administration in dogs 
and monkeys at doses up to 0.5 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively.
Arterial lesions characterised by arterial 
fibrinoid necrosis, medial degeneration, or 
haemorrhage were observed in various organs in 
rats, dogs, and monkeys.  The test article-related 
vascular lesions were histologically 
characterized by arterial fibrinoid necrosis, 
medial degeneration, or haemorrhage, and were 
observed in various organs in rats (spleen, 
kidney, testis, heart, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, 
and choroid plexus), monkeys (GI tract, 
gallbladder, and choroid plexus), and dogs (GI 
tract, gallbladder, liver, urinary bladder, heart, 
ovaries, uterus, vagina, adrenals, sciatic nerve, 
optic nerves, and mammary gland).  The 
vascular lesions in monkeys were less severe 
compared to those in dogs. 
Soft stool and watery stool were observed as GI 
effects in dogs and monkeys and were 
accompanied with histopathologic changes 
including haemorrhage, inflammation, 
erosion/ulcer, submucosal oedema, crypt 
hyperplasia, and mucosal atrophy.  Particularly, 
bloody and blackish stool were observed in 
dogs at lethal doses.  Both nonrodent species 
showed anorexia at higher doses and 
experienced severe morbidity.  These signs 
disappeared gradually after test drug 
withdrawal.
Hypertension has been observed in 
clinical trials.
The VEGF/VEGFR signalling 
pathway has a variety of 
physiological functions including the 
maintenance of vascular endothelial 
cell homeostasis under normal 
conditions and following injury.  
Inhibition of this pathway can 
compromise the integrity of the 
vascular endothelial cell lining and 
this can predispose to platelet 
aggregation, arterial 
thromboembolic events (ATEs), 
cardiac failure, and haemorrhage.  
Such events have been observed in 
clinical trials.
GI toxicity has been observed with 
clinical use.

Changes in the pancreas were noted in rats 
administered 10 mg/kg/day in a 26-week oral 
toxicity study (pancreatitis, fatty necrosis, and 
decreased zymogen granules) and in monkeys 
administered 3 mg/kg/day in a 39-week oral 
toxicity study (decreased zymogen granules).
Lenvatinib caused bone changes, specifically 
increased thickness of epiphyseal growth plate 
and cartilage in rats and monkeys, which were 
characterised by increased thickening of the 
cartilage layer in bones.  Dysplasia in incisors 
was also observed in rats. 
Ovarian changes characterised by follicular 
atresia or increased atretic follicles were 
observed in rats, dogs, and monkeys.  Decreased 
menstruation was observed during long-term 
studies in monkeys.  Effects were observed in 
nonrodents at exposures below the anticipated 
clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the 
maximum recommended human dose.
Testicular hypocellularity was observed in rats, 
dogs, and monkeys.  Effects were observed in 
nonrodents at exposures below the anticipated 
Events of pancreatitis were observed 
in clinical trials but were assessed 
not to be related to lenvatinib.  
However, given that pancreatitis is a 
safety concern for other TKIs, this 
finding for lenvatinib is deemed to 
be of unknown significance to 
human usage.
Bone changes are considered 
relevant to the paediatric population, 
in which bone development 
continues through adolescence.  The 
bone changes in rats are not 
considered relevant to human adults 
because unlike human adults, 
rodents have continuous growth of 
epiphyseal cartilage in bones 
throughout life.  Therefore this 
finding is considered relevant only 
to the paediatric population and not 
the targeted (ie, adult) population.
The incisor changes in rats are not 
considered relevant to humans 
because unlike human teeth, rodent 
incisors are open-rooted and grow 
continuously throughout life, 
making them more sensitive to the 
pharmacologic effects of lenvatinib.  
As human teeth do not grow and 
remodel continuously throughout 
life, they are not expected to exhibit 
the same sensitivity to the effects of 
lenvatinib.  Visible changes in rat 
molars, which do not grow 
continuously throughout life and 
therefore may be more 
representative of human teeth, were 
not noted in the rat toxicity studies 
with lenvatinib. 
Female fertility may be affected.
Male fertility may be affected.

May be associated with abnormal 
pregnancy outcome.
May be excreted in human breast 
milk.
The prominent toxicity observed in 
very young juvenile rats (dosing 
initiated on PND7) suggests that 
administration to paediatric patients 
under the age of 2 years is not 
appropriate as many of the target 
organs (CV system, kidney, and 
bone) of lenvatinib continue to 
develop after birth in children.  By 
2 years of age, development of the 
CV system and kidney are complete; 
however, the effects of lenvatinib on 
bones in juvenile animals suggest an 
increased risk for bone effects in 
children, who have an active growth 
plate.
clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the 
maximum recommended human dose.
Administration of lenvatinib during 
organogenesis resulted in embryo lethality and 
teratogenicity in both rats and rabbits at 
exposures below the clinical exposure (based on 
AUC) at the maximum recommended human 
dose.  Fetal external and skeletal anomalies 
were observed at lenvatinib doses ≥0.1 mg/kg in 
rats, and fetal external, visceral, or skeletal 
anomalies were noted at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg in 
rabbits.
Lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in 
rat milk.  Low levels of radioactivity were 
detected in rat pups after oral administration of 
14C-lenvatinib to lactating rats.
In a 2-week dose range finding (DRF) study in 
juvenile rats the toxicity of lenvatinib was more 
prominent in younger rats (dosing initiated on 
postnatal day [PND] 7) compared with those 
with dosing initiated on PND21.
Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesilate
(0.4, 2, or 10 mg/kg) to young rats for 8 weeks 
starting on PND21 resulted in growth 
retardation (decreased body weight gain and 
decreased food consumption), secondary delay 
of physical development, and lesions 
attributable to pharmacologic effects (incisors, 
femur, kidneys, adrenals, and duodenum) at 
doses ≥2 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the 
systemic exposure [AUC] in patients 
administered the recommended human dose).  
Additional findings observed in the rats 
administered 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 to 
11 times the systemic exposure [AUC] in 
patients administered the recommended human 
dose) included mortality attributed to primary 
duodenal lesions.  The toxicologic profile of 
lenvatinib in young rats was similar to the 
profile in adult animals, and toxicities were 
mostly reversible during the 4-week recovery 
period.  The no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was 0.4 mg/kg.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Proteinuria has been observed with 
clinical use.
Elevated transaminase levels and 
other signs of hepatotoxicity have 
been observed with clinical use.
No risk anticipated.
Not applicable; therefore this is not 
carried over as an important 
nonclinical safety concern.
Lenvatinib is anticipated to have a 
low risk of CV, respiratory and 
central nervous system adverse 
effects in humans, although 
hypertension was observed in 
subjects in clinical trials.
Low risk of interference with the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of other 
drugs co-administered in usual 
clinical practice.
Lenvatinib caused glomerulopathy, sometimes 
with proteinuria, in rats, dogs, and monkeys at 
dose levels of 2 mg/kg (26-week toxicity study), 
0.5 mg/kg (4 week toxicity study), and 
0.5 mg/kg (39-week toxicity study), 
respectively.  Reversibility of this glomerular
change was investigated in rats (15 mg/kg), 
dogs (0.5 mg/kg), and monkeys (3 and 
30 mg/kg) and was confirmed in all species. 
In a 26-week oral toxicity study in rats, changes 
in the liver (Kupffer cell hypertrophy or 
hyperplasia and pigmentation of periportal 
hepatocytes) were observed at 10 mg/kg.  These 
were secondary to vascular changes attributed to 
the pharmacologic effect of the drug and 
therefore were not a significant nonclinical 
concern.  Elevated transaminase levels were 
observed in rats, dogs, and monkeys, and were 
associated with marked toxicity.
In the standard battery of genotoxicity studies, 
lenvatinib was negative in the Ames assay, 
mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase (tk) assay, 
and micronucleus assay in rats. 
In accordance with the recommendations of 
ICH S9, Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer 
Pharmaceuticals, no carcinogenicity studies 
have been conducted.
No significant adverse effects of lenvatinib on 
the CV, respiratory, and central nervous system 
were observed in rats and dogs.  With the 
exception of a weak inhibitory effect of 
lenvatinib on human ether-à-go-go-related gene 
(hERG) potassium current 
(IC50 = 11.89 μmol/L), no significant adverse 
effects were observed in the 2 in vitro 
electrophysiology studies conducted to assess 
the effect of lenvatinib on hERG potassium 
current or action potential parameters.
Drug metabolising enzyme and transporter 
inhibition
In vitro, lenvatinib exhibited a potent inhibitory 
effect on CYP2C8 (IC50: 10.1 µmol/L), and 
weakly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in human 
liver microsomes.  Virtually no inhibition of 
CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 was seen.  
In human liver microsomes, lenvatinib directly 
inhibited UGT1A1 and UGT1A4. In contrast, 
inhibition of UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B17, or

UGT2B7 by lenvatinib was minimal or not 
observed.  In human liver cytosol, lenvatinib did 
not inhibit aldehyde oxidase activity.  In vitro, 
lenvatinib did not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp), 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and 
OATP1B3, and weakly inhibited OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, and bile salt export 
pump (BSEP).  Time-dependent inhibition of 
the formation of 1´ hydroxymidazolam from 
midazolam (CYP3A) by lenvatinib was 
observed.  
Drug metabolising enzyme and transporter 
induction
Lenvatinib slightly induced CYP3A4 but had no 
effects on CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2B6, or P-gp (MDR1).
Lenvatinib did not induce UGT1A1, UGT1A4, 
UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7 enzyme 
activities.
Substrate potency of transporters
Lenvatinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. 
Lenvatinib is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, or BSEP.  
Lenvatinib absorbs light within the range of 
290–700 nm, and has an affinity to melanin 
based on the slow elimination of radioactivity in 
the melanin-containing tissues; however, the 
results of the in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake 
phototoxicity test were negative.

PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
The pooled safety analyses include subjects from completed studies who received single-
agent lenvatinib on a continuous basis, the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab and 
the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus.  Specific safety sets were created to evaluate 
the safety profile of lenvatinib monotherapy and lenvatinib combination therapy in subjects 
with the various carcinoma types.
The clinical trial exposure data are summarised by the following analysis sets: 
• All DTC, Non-HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, which is hereafter referred to as
“All DTC” – including all subjects with DTC and Non-HCC who were treated with
lenvatinib (N=458).  This includes data from subjects with DTC from Studies 201 and
208, as well as from Study 303 (including subjects in the randomised lenvatinib arm and
the optional open-label portion of the study).  The data cutoff date for this safety set is 10
Dec 2014.
• Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Set – including data from all remaining studies conducted
in non-DTC subjects with cancer (including tumour types such as endometrial, glioma,
melanoma, MTC) who received lenvatinib as monotherapy at the proposed dosing
regimen (N=656).  This includes data from subjects in Studies 101, 102 (monotherapy
cohort, continuous dosing), 104, 105, 203, 204, and 206, as well as subjects with MTC or

• All RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623), which is hereafter referred to as
the “RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set”– including all subjects with RCC who
were treated with the combination of lenvatinib at the recommended dose of 18 mg and
everolimus 5 mg in Study 112 (Phase 1; N=7), Study 205 (Phase 1b and Phase 2; N=62),
Arm A (Lenvatinib 18 mg + Everolimus) of Study 218 (Phase 2; N=168), Study 221
(Phase 2; N=31), and Arm A (Lenvatinib 18 mg + Everolimus) of Study 307 (Phase 3;

2020, 17 Jul 2019, and 28 Aug 2020, respectively.
• All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=497)– including data from all
subjects with RCC who received at least 1 dose of lenvatinib 20 mg QD +
pembrolizumab 200 mg as the starting dose, regardless of prior anticancer therapy, in
Study 307 (N=352) and Study 111(N=145).  The data cutoff date for the Study 307 safety
set is 28 Aug 2020 and for the Study 111 safety set is 18 Aug 2020.
• HCC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, which is hereafter referred to as the “HCC
Lenvatinib Safety Set” – including all subjects who received at least 1 dose of lenvatinib
in Study E7080-G000-304 (N=476) and subjects in the Phase 2 portion of Study E7080-
J081-202 who had a baseline body weight ≥60 kg and received at least 1 dose of
lenvatinib (ie, received the planned labelling dose) (N=20).
• All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab All Participants-as-Treated Population (APaT;
N=530), which is hereafter referred to as the “All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab
Safety Set” – including data from all subjects with EC who received at least 1 dose of
lenvatinib 20 mg QD + pembrolizumab 200 mg in Study 309 (N=406) and Study 111
(N=124).  The data cutoff date for this safety set is 26 Oct 2020 for Study 309 and
18 Aug 2020 for Study 111.
The All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set had a median treatment duration of 14.7 months, while 
the Non-DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy Safety Set had a median duration of 3.5 months.  The 
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set had a median treatment duration (lenvatinib) of 
9.3 months.  The All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set had a median treatment 
duration (lenvatinib) of 14.8 months.  The HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set had a median 
treatment duration of 5.9 months.  The All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set had a 
median treatment duration of 7.1 months.  Pooling of all safety sets could potentially have 
led to a dilution in incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the DTC and RCC 
populations; hence, the proposed analysis set groupings represent a conservative stance. 
The Non-DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy Safety Set has been further analysed to exclude non-
thyroid cancer patients, and this data has been presented under the identified risk section for 
hypothyroidism (See Section SVII.3).

Duration of exposure is defined as number of days a subject actually received a dose for the All DTC and Non-DTC, 
Non-HCC monotherapy sets.  Duration (days) of exposure is calculated as (Last dose date – First dose date + 1) for 
lenvatinib in the Safety Set.  For HCC Lenvatinib, duration of exposure is defined as the sum of all years based on 
treatment duration (date of last dose of study drug – first date of study drug +1).
Subject-year = sum of duration of exposure (in years) for all subjects in each category.
BID = twice daily, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma, OOL = optional open-label, 
QD = once daily, RCC = renal cell carcinoma, SY = subject-years.
a:  The lenvatinib starting dose was 24 mg QD except for 29 subjects (27 subjects from the OOL part of Study 303 had a 
starting dose of 20 mg QD and 2 subjects from Study 201 were treated with 10 mg BID).
b:  The lenvatinib starting dose was <14 mg (93 subjects), ≥14 to <20 mg (12 subjects), ≥20 to <24 mg (12 subjects), 
24 mg (508 subjects), and >24 mg (31 subjects).

SIV.2 Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial 
development programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect rare ADRs.  A total of 2597 
subjects have been exposed to a regimen of single-agent lenvatinib on a continuous basis per 
the latest Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) (Data Lock point [DLP] of 
12 Feb 2022).  ADRs with a frequency greater than 1 in 150 could be detected in the DTC 
population, and ADRs with a frequency greater than 1 in 160 could be detected in the HCC 
population.  ADRs with a frequency greater than 1 in 200 could be detected in the Lenvatinib 
+ Everolimus RCC population at the recommended combination regimen.  Adverse drug
reactions with a frequency greater than 1 in 160 could be detected in the All RCC Lenvatinib
+ Pembrolizumab Safety Set at the recommended combination regimen and ADRs with a

frequency greater than 1 in 170 could be detected in the All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab 
Safety Set at the recommended combination regimen.
More than two thirds (69.0%) of the 458 subjects with DTC received lenvatinib for over 
6 months, and 50.7% received it for over 1 year.  A total of 24.5% of subjects were treated 
for more than 2 years, and this population represents 49.7% (273.0/549.0 subject-years) of 
the total exposure in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set. 
Of the subjects with RCC in the Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, 64.7% had received 
lenvatinib for 6 months or more, and 40.6% had received lenvatinib for more than 1 year.  A 
total of 11.9% of subjects were treated with lenvatinib for more than 2 years, and this 
population represents 29.0% (176.97/609.95 subject-years) of the total exposure in the RCC 
Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set. 
Of the subjects with RCC in the All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set, 79.0% 
had received lenvatinib for 6 months or more, 58.3% had received lenvatinib for more than 
1 year and 24.1% had received lenvatinib for more than 2 years and represents 45.6% 
(292.73/641.78 subject-years) of the total exposure in this safety set.  
Approximately half (49.8%) of the subjects with HCC received lenvatinib for 6 months or 
more, and 24.0% received it for more than a year.  A total of 10.5% of subjects received 
lenvatinib for at least 18 months.
Of the subjects with EC in the All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set, 55.6% had 
received lenvatinib for 6 months or more, 26.2% had received lenvatinib for more than 1 
year, and 5.3% had received lenvatinib for more than 2 years representing 19.1% (76.2/399.8 
subject-years) of the total exposure in this safety set.  
The safety database should contain sufficient information to detect common AEs that are 
likely to occur after prolonged exposure to lenvatinib.

impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) were included in 
Study 307.
HCC:
The inclusion criteria for subjects with HCC 
participating in Study 202 and Study 304 required all 
subjects to have adequate renal function, defined as 
CrCl >40 mL/min as calculated per the Cockcroft and 
Gault formula (or serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL in 
Study 202).  In the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, 87.3% 
of subjects had normal renal function (CrCl 
≥60 mL/min) and 12.7% of subjects had mild-to-
moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 - <60 mL/min).  
There were no subjects with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl <30 mL/min).
EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Combination:
No subjects with severe renal impairment were 
included. Most subjects (81.9%) had normal renal 
function, defined as CrCl ≥60 mL/min; 17.7% of 
subjects had impaired renal function (defined as CrCl 
<60 mL/min) and contributed 51.4 subject-years of 
exposure.
Patients with significant CV impairment were not 
included in the clinical development program.
Immunocompromised patients were not included in 
the clinical development program.
DTC:

branch (Vp4).  Subjects also must have had at least 1 
measurable target lesion according to modified 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(mRECIST) with at least one dimension as ≥1.0 cm in 
the longest diameter or ≥2.0 cm in the short axis.  
Lenvatinib has not been studied in subjects with 
smaller target lesions.  Lenvatinib has also not been 
studied in subjects with Child-Pugh B or C (moderate 
or severe) hepatic impairment (since only subjects 
with Child-Pugh A were allowed to participate in 
Study 304), and in subjects with severe renal 
impairment (<30 mL/min) or ECOG PS of greater 
than 1.
EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Combination:

subjects were Asian, and 16 (3.5%) belonged to other 
races including Black and Native Hawaiian or other 
Pacific Islander.  Subjects of Asian origin contributed 
proportionally less exposure to the safety database.  
The Asian subpopulation largely comprised Japanese 
subjects (65/97 [67%]) who tended to have a longer 
duration of treatment (median of 17.7 vs. 13.8 
months), and a higher occurrence of dose reduction 
(95.4% vs. 75.1%) compared with non-Japanese 
subjects.
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Combination:
In the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, the 
highest proportion of subjects were from Western 
Europe and North America (62.4%), followed by the 
Rest of World (37.6%).  Nearly all subjects were 
white (76.7%); 112 subjects (18.0%) were Asian, 
16 subjects (2.6%) were of other race groups, and for 
17 subjects (2.7%), information was missing for race.  
Exposure relative to the numbers of subjects was 
similar for the white and Asian populations.
RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Combination:
In the All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety 
Set, 385 subjects (77.5%) were white and contributed 
504.07 subject-years of exposure, 84 subjects (16.9%) 
were Asian and contributed 101.64 subject-years of

groups.  Exposure relative to the numbers of subjects 
was similar for the white and Asian populations.
HCC:
In the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, the majority of 
subjects (68.8%) were located in the Asia Pacific 
Region (China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea), and all 
other subjects (31.2%) were from Western regions 
(EU, Canada, Israel, and North America).  Subjects 
from other global regions were not represented.  The 
highest proportion of subjects was Asian (71.2%), 
followed by white (27.0%).  Of the remaining 
subjects, 1.4% were Black or African American, and 
there was 1 subject each (0.2%) of American Indian or 
Alaska Native, and Other Race.
EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Combination:
In the All EC Lenvatinib plus Pembrolizumab Safety 
Set, most subjects were from outside of the EU region 
(74.2%); 25.8% of subjects were located in EU. The 
highest proportion of subjects was white (68.7%),

Children
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Lenvatinib is not licensed for use in children.  A 
paediatric investigational plan (PIP; EMEA-001119-
PIP02-12-M08) is in place for the treatment of 
follicular thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, or 
refractory/relapsed osteosarcoma in subjects from 
2 years to less than 18 years of age (≤25 years for 
osteosarcoma), with a waiver for the paediatric 
population from birth to less than 2 years of age.
The 2 clinical studies included in this PIP are as 
follows:  Study E7080-G000-207 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 207) and Study E7080-G000-230 
(hereafter referred to as Study 230).  Study 207 
evaluated the activity of lenvatinib or lenvatinib in 
combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in 
paediatric subjects with solid tumor malignancies and 
young adults with osteosarcoma.  Study 230 compared 
the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination 
with ifosfamide and etoposide to ifosfamide and 
etoposide in paediatric and young adult subjects with 
relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma.
The observed safety profile of lenvatinib as 
monotherapy or in combination with ifosfamide and 
etoposide was overall consistent with the known 
safety profile of lenvatinib in adults and children, and 
the established safety profiles of ifosfamide and 
etoposide.  Although signals of activity were observed 
for lenvatinib as a single agent or in combination with
ifosfamide and etoposide, the safety and efficacy of 
lenvatinib in children aged 2 to <18 years have not 
been established and the results of these studies do not 
support an indication for lenvatinib in paediatric 
patients with relapsed or refractory DTC or 
osteosarcoma.
PART II: MODULE SV - POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE
SV.1 Post-authorisation exposure
SV.1.1 Method used to calculate exposure
The method used to calculate exposure utilises the wholesale data on the number of 
lenvatinib tablets sold, providing an estimate of the total quantity (mg) of lenvatinib; this is 
then converted into patient days exposure, assuming an average daily dose of 16.1 mg for 
lenvatinib (based on data from the E7080-G000-303 study).  The estimate of exposure is 
likely to be lower than the actual exposure as the HCC indication is now approved in a 
number of countries.  The recommended starting dose of lenvatinib in HCC is 8 mg or 12 mg 
daily and the estimated number of patients treated for HCC is now higher than for DTC and 
RCC; it is not currently possible to determine what the proportion of use has been in HCC or 
what the average daily dose is in clinical practice.

SV.1.2 Exposure
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Up to 12 Feb 2022 (DLP of most recent PSUR), it is estimated that there have been 
approximately 61,900 patient-years of exposure since the IBD.
Post-marketing data are not generally available by age group, gender, or indication, but based 
on available data within the most recent PSUR it is estimated that approximately 31,385 
patients with DTC, 9357 with RCC (lenvatinib and everolimus; lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab), 11,463 with EC (lenvatinib and pembrolizumab) and 191,397 with HCC 
have been exposed.
PART II: MODULE SVI - ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes:
There have been no psychoactive effects reported with the use of lenvatinib.  Therefore, there 
is no perceived potential for lenvatinib to be used for illegal purposes.

Identified Risk:  Proteinuria and Nephrotic Syndrome
Potential 
mechanisms:
Evidence source(s)
and strength of 
evidence:
Characterisation of 
the risk:
The mechanism of proteinuria in response to kinase inhibition has been postulated to 
be due to alteration in the normal biological activity of VEGF by podocytes.  In 
nonclinical models, an abnormally low secretion of VEGF-A by podocytes or the 
inhibition of its activity interferes with normal kidney function and results in multiple 
alterations including proteinuria.  Other possible mechanisms are the concomitant 
occurrence of hypertension as a consequence of reduced production of nitric oxide 
(NO) and glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (Horsley, et al., 2012).
The essential pathological process in nephrotic syndrome of any aetiology is due to 
an increased glomerular permeability to large molecules, mostly albumin but 
including other plasma proteins.  Proteinuria causes a fall in serum albumin and if the 
liver fails to fully compensate for urinary protein losses by increased albumin 
synthesis, plasma albumin concentrations decline, leading to oedema formation. 
(Hull and Goldsmith, 2008).
Evidence from randomised clinical studies.  In randomised clinical trials, proteinuria 
was reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.  There was only 1 
nephrotic syndrome event on the active arm compared to none in the placebo arm. 
Nephrotic syndrome was identified from post-marketing surveillance.

Frequency
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  Proteinuria (per standard Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] query [SMQ]) was reported in 
38.9% of subjects and included TEAEs of proteinuria (38.9%) and protein urine 
present (0.4%). Nephrotic syndrome was reported in 1 subject (0.2%).
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  Proteinuria (per SMQ) was 
reported in 34.8% of subjects and included TEAEs of proteinuria (34.2%), and 
protein in urine present (0.5%).  Urine protein/creatinine ratio increased and

syndrome were reported in this cohort.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  Proteinuria (per SMQ) was reported in 27.4% 
of subjects.  No events of nephrotic syndrome were reported in this cohort.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  Proteinuria (per SMQ) was

All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set  (N=530):  Proteinuria (per SMQ) 
was reported in 29.4% of subjects.  No events of nephrotic syndrome were reported 
in this cohort.
Post-authorisation events of proteinuria have been in accordance with the safety 
profile of lenvatinib in clinical trials.

Seriousness/outcomes
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  The TEAE of proteinuria was considered 
to be serious in only 2 subjects (0.4%).  In both cases the proteinuria was Grade 3 in 
severity and both subjects were hospitalised.  Lenvatinib treatment was discontinued 
in 1 subject and the event resolved.  Lenvatinib treatment was interrupted in the other 
subject but the event did not resolve.  The sole serious event of nephrotic syndrome 
(Grade 2) was considered medically important by the investigator.  
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  Four subjects (0.6%) had SAEs 
of proteinuria.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  Proteinuria was reported as an SAE in 
3 subjects (0.6%). All subjects were hospitalized, and in all cases the proteinuria was 
Grade 2 in severity.  Lenvatinib treatment was interrupted in all 3 subjects and the 
proteinuria resolved or was resolving in all subjects.  Lenvatinib therapy was 
restarted at a reduced dose in 1 subject and the 2 other subjects withdrew from the 
study.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  Proteinuria was reported as an SAE 
in 1 subject (0.2%) and was Grade 2 in severity.  Treatment was interrupted and the 
event was resolving.
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set  (N=530):  1 subject (0.2%) had an 
SAE of proteinuria, which was Grade 3 in severity.  No action was taken regarding 
lenvatinib and the event of proteinuria resolved.

Severity and nature of risk
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  Proteinuria was Grade 1 or 2 for the 
majority of subjects.  Grade 3 events for proteinuria were reported in 10.5% of 
subjects.  There were no Grade 4 or 5 TEAEs for proteinuria.  Dose interruptions and 
reductions for proteinuria were reported in 16.2% and 10.9% of subjects, 
respectively.  However, proteinuria led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.3% of 
subjects (n=6).  The majority of cases had an outcome of recovered or resolved 
following dose interruption or reduction.
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  The majority of TEAEs of 
proteinuria (16.4%) were Grade 2.  Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 8.8% of 
subjects.  There was one Grade 4 and no Grade 5 TEAEs for proteinuria.  Dose 
interruptions and reductions for proteinuria were reported in 9.8% and 9.6% of 
subjects, respectively.  Proteinuria led to treatment discontinuation in 2.1% of 
subjects.  The majority of cases had an outcome of recovered or resolved following 
dose interruption or reduction.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  The majority of TEAEs of proteinuria were 
Grade 2 (11.1%).  Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 6.7% of subjects.  Dose 
interruptions and reductions for proteinuria were reported in 6.9% and 3.0% of 
subjects, respectively.  However, proteinuria led to treatment discontinuation in only 
1.2% of subjects (n=6).

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
DTC The presence of hypertension during lenvatinib treatment appeared to be 
correlated with the development of proteinuria.  The incidence of proteinuria was 
higher in females, Asians, elderly subjects (≥75 years of age), diabetic subjects, and 
subjects with baseline renal function impairment.
RCC (Lenvatinib + Everolimus):  The incidence of proteinuria increased with 
increasing age and was higher in the Asian population and subjects with baseline 
diabetes.  In subjects aged <65 years, the incidence of proteinuria was 31.1%, and in 
subjects aged ≥65 to <75 and ≥75 years, the incidences were 38.5% and 43.7%, 
respectively.  Asian subjects had a higher incidence of proteinuria (52.7%) than white 
subjects (31.0%) with a higher incidence of Grade 3 TEAEs (17.9% vs 7.3%).  
Subjects with baseline diabetes were also more likely to experience proteinuria 
events than those without (50.0% vs 31.3%), although the differences in Grade 3 
events were smaller in magnitude (11.0% vs 8.5%).  The presence of baseline 
hypertension was associated with a modest increase in the incidence of proteinuria 
(38.9%) compared with subjects without baseline hypertension (29.1%).
RCC (Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab):  The incidence of proteinuria was increased 
with increasing age, was higher in Asians, and subjects with baseline hypertension.  
The incidence of proteinuria and severe (Grade 3 or more) TEAEs increased with 
advancing age.  In subjects aged <65 years, the incidence of proteinuria was 29.5% 
(Grade≥ 3 :6.4%), and in subjects aged ≥65 to <75 and ≥75 years, the incidences 
were 36.0% and 41.8% (Grade ≥3: 9.3%, 12.7% ) respectively.  Asian subjects had a 
higher incidence of proteinuria (56.0%) than White subjects (28.8%) with a 
corresponding higher incidence of Grade 3 TEAEs (19.0% vs 6.0%).  Subjects with 
baseline hypertension were also more likely to experience proteinuria events than 
those without (38.6% vs 24.2%), although the differences in Grade 3 events were 
smaller in magnitude. (9.6% vs 5.7%).
HCC:  The incidence of proteinuria increased with advancing age.  The overall 
incidence of TEAEs and the incidence of severe (Grade 3) TEAEs for proteinuria 
tended to be higher in the 2 older age groups compared with the youngest subjects.  
In subjects aged <65 years the incidence of proteinuria was 21.2%, and in subjects 
≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years, the incidences were 34.2% and 39.7%, respectively.  In 
addition, subjects from the Asia-Pacific region had a notably higher incidence of 
proteinuria (31.7%) compared with subjects from Western Regions (18.1%).  Asian 
Eisai

Lenvatinib
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
subjects had a higher incidence of proteinuria (30.9%) than white subjects (20.1%).  
In addition, the incidences of severe (Grade 3) TEAEs in Asian subjects were higher 
than those in White subjects and the incidences in subjects from the Asia-Pacific 
region were higher than those for subjects from the Western regions.  Of note, the 
incidence of proteinuria in subjects with an ECOG PS of ≥1 was lower (21.0%) 
compared with subjects with an ECOG PS of 0 (30.9%), however the number of 
subjects with a Baseline ECOG PS of ≥1 was small (n=37).
Events of nephrotic syndrome were rare in the clinical trial cohorts, but theoretically 
the risks for nephrotic syndrome are similar to those for proteinuria.
Proteinuria can be controlled with routine monitoring and dose modifications.  Urine 
protein should be monitored regularly in all subjects receiving lenvatinib.  If urine 
dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or 
discontinuation may be necessary based on individual safety and tolerability. 
Because no interventional study has been performed with regard to proteinuria 
induced by VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents, and because the mechanisms underlying 
its development are not well understood, evidence-based recommendations cannot be 
made and most treatments are nonspecific, but may include angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
The risk of nephrotic syndrome is mitigated by urinary protein monitoring and dose 
modifications as nephrotic syndrome follows severe or untreated proteinuria.  
Routine risk minimisation measures have been implemented, and proteinuria and 
nephrotic syndrome are not expected to impact the risk-benefit balance of lenvatinib.
No public health impact identified.

Identified Risk:  Renal Failure or Impairment
Potential mechanisms:
Renal events are well known AEs associated with treatment with TKIs (Chen and 
Cleck, 2009).
VEGF plays a role in maintaining mucosal homeostasis and mucosal 
epithelialization after mucosal damage, and it has been proposed that VEGF 
inhibition can result in mucosal damage leading to cutaneous toxicity, and upper 
or lower digestive tract mucositis with pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.  This can then 
lead to lower intake and GI uptake of fluids resulting in dehydration and 
subsequent renal injury. 
The important identified risk of proteinuria, as discussed above, is also a direct 
toxic effect on the kidney.  
Although most subjects who developed renal failure or impairment had 1 or more 
contributory factors, some subjects did not have relevant comorbidities or prior 
relevant medical history.  Therefore, causality secondary to the administration of 
lenvatinib cannot be excluded due to its known class antiangiogenic effects on 
the kidney.
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical studies.  In randomised clinical trials, renal 
failure and impairment was reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than 
placebo.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Risk factors associated with renal impairment or failure in patients receiving 
lenvatinib include dehydration and/or hypovolemia, underlying chronic renal 
impairment, adrenal mass, and sepsis.  Almost all subjects who developed renal 
failure or impairment had 1 or more contributory factors, such as hypertension, 
diabetes, poor oral intake, GI toxicity (such as diarrhea and or vomiting) leading 
to dehydration, malnutrition, rhabdomyolysis (due to treatment with a statin), 
infection, urinary retention, progressive metastatic disease with cancer-related 
cachexia, or prior history of chronic renal failure and adrenal mass.
Eisai

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
The primary risk factor identified was dehydration and/or hypovolemia due to GI 
toxicity or sepsis.  GI toxicity was more pronounced in the RCC Lenvatinib 
Everolimus Safety Set and included diarrhoea (69.0% overall), which was 
Grade ≥3 in 13.8% of subjects.  For most subjects, there was no correlation 
between the incidence of observed diarrhoea events and the incidence of renal
failure events across treatment groups in the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus 
Safety Set.  Despite the differences between frequency of diarrhoea in the 
Lenvatinib + Everolimus RCC Combination Group (69.0%) compared with 
lenvatinib monotherapy (34.0%), the difference in incidences of renal events was 
17.2% versus 10.0%, respectively.
Gastrointestinal disorders such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting 
are very commonly reported in subjects treated with lenvatinib and can result in 
serious consequences such as dehydration and acute renal failure.  Supportive 
care and close monitoring should be promptly initiated.
Gastrointestinal toxicity resulting in dehydration should be actively managed 
with intravenous fluid therapy in order to reduce the risk of development of renal 
impairment or renal failure.  Dose interruptions, adjustments, or treatment 
discontinuation may be necessary.
Renal impairment is not expected to impact the risk-benefit balance of lenvatinib 
with routine monitoring unless the event develops into renal failure.
If renal failure develops then there may be a significant impact on public health
resources as the patient would require hospitalization and renal support.

Identified Risk:  Cardiac Failure
Potential mechanisms:
The potential risk of cardiomyopathy with VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy is 
suggested in cardiomyocyte-specific VEGF knockout mouse models, which present 
with dilated cardio myopathy.  In the developed heart, VEGF is important for 
maintaining cardiomyocyte well-being in response to stress and injury. Additional 
molecular pathways targeted by TKIs may also play a role.  For example, PDGFR, 
a target of sunitinib and sorafenib, is expressed on cardiac myocytes and is a potent 
stimulus of normal cardio myocyte growth under hypertensive stress (Chen and 
Cleck, 2009).
Cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure (CHF) have been reported with the 
use of VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies including sunitinib, in which a decrease in 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the normal range was observed in 
20% of subjects treated, and 8% developed clinical CHF (Di Lorenzo, et al., 2009; 
Richards, et al., 2011). 
Evidence source(s) 
and strength of 
evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical studies.  In randomised clinical trials, decreased 
ejection fraction/cardiac failure was reported in more patients treated with 
lenvatinib than placebo.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
DTC
Most subjects had individual risk factors that could have predisposed to decreased 
EF, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes 
mellitus, obesity, preexisting heart disease, and prior anthracycline use.
Refractory CHF with fatal outcome has rarely been reported.  In most subjects, 
ventricular dysfunction improved after discontinuation of the VEGF/VEGFR–
targeted therapy, although it is unclear whether this is true reversibility of the 
adverse effect, or due to efficacy of cardiac medications, or both. 
Importantly, evaluation of the changes in echocardiographic parameters in 
Study 204 has demonstrated that the observed changes in LVEF were small and the 
results did not suggest a direct cardiotoxic effect of lenvatinib.
RCC
Subjects with RCC were predominantly older, overweight males with underlying 
risk factors of hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus, all of which are known risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease 
and subsequent complications of cardiac dysfunction.  Additionally, RCC subjects 
are at a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease, which is independently 
associated with increased cardiovascular risk due to dysregulation of lipid 
metabolism (Chang et al., 2014; Ferro et al., 2018).
HCC
Portal hypertension is a common comorbidity in subjects with HCC, a risk factor 
that could have predisposed to cardiac failure events.  Ascites and 
gastrooesophageal varices are the most frequent manifestations of clinically 
Eisai
Page 71 of 163
Lenvatinib
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
significant portal hypertension.  Extrahepatic changes are known to occur in the 
presence of portal hypertension, in addition to disease progression.  These include 
the development of hypovolaemia which results in hyperkinetic syndrome that 
causes portal venous blood flow increase.  Further increases in portal hypertension 
can impair cardiac function and the consequences may be life-threatening (La 
Mura, et al., 2015).
Cardiovascular risk assessment for risk groups such as adults with chronic kidney 
disease and/or diabetes is available and involves evaluation and management of 
lipid profile, blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors through 
therapeutic lifestyle changes or medication (Kidney Disease|Improving Global 
Outcomes [KDIGO], 2012; KDIGO, 2013; KDIGO, 2020).  Patients should be 
monitored for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac decompensation, as dose 
interruptions, adjustments, or permanent discontinuation may be necessary.
Routine risk minimisation measures have been put in place.
The potential public health impact could be significant; however, the risk should be 
manageable with the recommended monitoring and dose adjustment.

Identified Risk:  Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
Potential mechanisms:
Legriel, et al. (2011) reported that the pathophysiology of PRES remains 
controversial.  The 2 main hypotheses contradict each other.  One involves 
impaired cerebral autoregulation responsible for an increase in cerebral blood flow, 
whereas the other involves endothelial dysfunction with cerebral hypoperfusion.  
This hypoperfusion hypothesis may be most relevant to cases of PRES associated 
with cytotoxic therapy.  Under both hypotheses, the result of the cerebral blood 
perfusion abnormalities is blood-brain barrier dysfunction with cerebral vasogenic 
edema. 
When mean arterial pressure (MAP) is within the range of 60 to 120 mmHg, 
cerebral autoregulation via variations in vasoconstriction and vasodilatation keeps 
the cerebral blood flow at about 50 mL/100 g/min in healthy individuals.  To 
overcome this autoregulation mechanism, MAP must exceed 170 mmHg (systolic 
BP/diastolic BP of 220/110 mmHg).  However, a smaller MAP increase of only 
50 mmHg (systolic BP/diastolic BP of 160/100 mmHg) in a patient with de novo 
hypertension is sufficient to trigger severe vasoconstriction.  Cerebral 
hyperperfusion leads to the release of the vasodilators nitric oxide (NO) and 
prostacyclin under the influence of endothelial agonists such as acetylcholine, 
norepinephrine, and substance P.  The net result leads to direct cytotoxic effects on 
the blood vessel wall.  This damage to the vascular endothelium causes blood-brain 
barrier dysfunction and cerebral vasogenic edema.
Not all patients with PRES have hypertension.  In patients with PRES and normal 
BP, cytotoxicity has been hypothesised to be the mechanism underlying the brain 
edema.  Causes of PRES without hypertension include eclampsia/ preeclampsia, 
cyclosporine toxicity, and infection/sepsis/septic shock.  The potential mechanisms 
vary with the cause.  Immune system (T-cell) activation leads to endothelial cell 
activation with the release of various mediators such as histamine, free radicals, 
NO, bradykinin, and arachidonic acid.  This ultimately results in vascular 
instability with vasoconstriction and downstream hypoperfusion.  Blood-brain 
barrier dysfunction occurs, leading to vasogenic cerebral edema.

Certain toxic agents are well known to be associated with PRES and these include 
antiangiogenic agents.
Evidence source(s) 
and strength of 
evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical trials.  A small number of events of PRES were 
reported in patients treated with lenvatinib and PRES is a known effect associated 
with other antiangiogenic agents. 
Characterisation of the 
risk:

Frequency
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  One TEAE for PRES per SGQ (0.2%) 
was reported.
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  One TEAE of PRES was 
reported for 1 subject treated with the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  One TEAE for PRES per SGQ (0.2%) was 
reported.
In addition, 2 TEAEs for PRES were reported in the Non-DTC, Non-HCC 
Monotherapy Safety Set (N=656).
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  Treatment-emergent AEs for 
PRES (SMQ) events were reported in 0.6% of subjects (n=2).
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=530):  Treatment-emergent AEs for PRES 
(SMQ) events were reported in 0.4% of subjects (n=2).
Post-authorisation events of PRES have been in accordance with the safety profile 
of lenvatinib in clinical trials.

Seriousness/outcomes
All events of PRES in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets (All DTC, non-
DTC, Non-HCC and HCC) were considered SAEs.
In the lenvatinib monotherapy safety sets, all SAEs of PRES were nonfatal, 2 were 
life threatening (1 each in the All DTC and the Non-DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy 
Safety Sets), 3 required hospitalization, and all recovered or resolved with 
treatment and dose interruption (1 event in All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set) or dose 
interruption alone (1 event each in the Non-DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy Safety 
Set and in the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set), or after permanent treatment 
discontinuation (1 event each in Non-DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy and RCC 
Monotherapy Safety Sets).
All RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus (N=623):  The event of PRES was not serious.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  Both events of PRES were 
nonfatal and were considered SAEs.
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=530):  Both events of PRES were nonfatal 
and resolved with dose interruption (lenvatinib) or after permanent treatment 
discontinuation.  One TEAE of PRES was an SAE.

Severity and nature of risk
One event of PRES reported in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set was of Grade 2 
and led to dose reduction. Of the 2 PRES events in the Non-DTC, Non-HCC 
Monotherapy Safety Set, 1 was of Grade 3 and 1 was of Grade 4. One event led to 
treatment discontinuation and 1 led to dose interruption. 
The event of PRES in the RCC lenvatinib monotherapy arm was Grade 3 and led to 
study drug discontinuation.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus (N=623):  One event of PRES reported was of 
Grade 2 and did not lead to any dose modification or discontinuation.
The 1 event of PRES in the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set was Grade 2 and resulted 
in study drug interruption.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Preventability
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  One SAE of PRES was Grade 3 
and resulted in lenvatinib dose reduction; the second SAE was Grade 4 and resulted 
in permanent treatment discontinuation of lenvatinib.
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=530):  One event of PRES was Grade 1 
and resulted in dose interruption (lenvatinib); the second event was Grade 3 and 
resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation.
PRES is a known uncommon TEAE (affecting <1% of subjects) associated with 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents.  Blood pressure is elevated from baseline in most, 
but not all, patients (Chen and Cleck, 2009).
Systemic hypertension is a major risk factor (Le and Loghin, 2014).
There are multiple well defined conditions that can cause PRES in cancer patients, 
including hypertension and renal dysfunction, as can immunosuppressants, 
chemotherapeutic drugs, bone marrow/stem cell transplants, corticosteroids, and 
growth factors (Le and Loghin, 2014).
Targeted therapies such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, and temsirolimus 
have been implicated as well, given their role in VEGF inhibition, causing 
disruption of angiogenesis and vasoconstriction, resulting in thrombotic events and 
systemic hypertension (Le and Loghin, 2014).
PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, 
lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or 
neurological disturbances.  Mild to severe hypertension may be present.  Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.  
Appropriate measures should be taken to control BP.  In patients with signs or
symptoms of PRES, dose interruptions, adjustments, or permanent discontinuation 
may be necessary.
For patients with hypertension, BP should be adequately controlled prior to 
initiation of lenvatinib treatment.  Regular monitoring of BP is required for patients 
whilst on treatment.
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product:
Routine risk minimisation measures have been put in place.  PRES is a rare but 
well characterised risk and with monitoring of the primary risk factor 
(hypertension) PRES is not expected to impact the risk-benefit balance of 
lenvatinib.
Public health impact:
No public health impact identified.
Identified Risk:  Hepatotoxicity
Potential mechanisms:
Liver events are known to be associated with treatment with TKIs (Caprelsa 
[vandetanib] European Public Assessment Report [EPAR], Inlyta [axitinib] 
EPAR, and Nexavar [sorafenib] EPAR).  The potential mechanisms are not clear.  
Likely mechanisms include oxidative stress from reactive metabolites, immune 
injury, and disruption of hepatic bile acid transport and resulting mitochondrial 
dysfunction (Spraggs, et al., 2013).
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical trials.  In randomised clinical trials liver-
related reactions were reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than 
placebo.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Preventability
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product:
Public health impact:
Because of the high prevalence of cirrhosis in HCC, this patient group is 
predisposed to higher incidences of hepatotoxic events compared with other 
indications.
In other indications, multiple confounding factors were observed in subjects in 
the clinical trial program, such as the presence of liver metastases or progression 
of preexisting liver metastases, concurrent medications, and contributing 
comorbidities.  However, there were a few cases without any confounding 
factors, that occurred shortly after the start of treatment with lenvatinib and that 
resolved upon discontinuation of lenvatinib.  Therefore, causality secondary to 
the administration of lenvatinib cannot be ruled out.
Combination with Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which may trigger immune-
related reactions.  Hepatitis events including those of autoimmune hepatitis, 
immune-mediated hepatitis, drug induced liver injury and acute hepatitis are 
ADRs of pembrolizumab (Keytruda SmPC).  
Liver function tests should be monitored before initiation of treatment, then every 
2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter during treatment.  In the 
case of hepatotoxicity, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be 
necessary.
Routine risk minimisation measures have been put in place.
If hepatic failure occurred, it could have a significant impact on an individual 
patient, however, with the proposed monitoring and dose adjustment schedule the 
risk of this event is low in the setting of DTC and RCC; however, the risk is 
higher in HCC due to the high prevalence of liver cirrhosis.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Identified Risk:  Haemorrhagic Events
Potential mechanisms:
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted antiangiogenesis agents can be associated with bleeding 
and haemorrhage including tumour bleeding (Chen and Cleck, 2009).  Two 
distinctive types of bleeding have been described: mild spontaneous 
mucocutaneous bleeding and serious tumour-related bleeding.
Inhibition of VEGF could diminish the regenerative capacity of endothelial cells 
and cause defects that expose pro-coagulant phospholipids on the luminal plasma 
membrane or underlying matrix, leading to haemorrhage or thrombosis (Kilickap, 
et al., 2003).  VEGF increases production of NO and prostacyclin (PGI2, 
prostaglandin I2), suppresses pathways involved in endothelial cell activation, 
apoptosis, and pro-coagulant changes, and inhibits proliferation of vascular 
smooth muscle cells (Zachary, 2001).  However, endothelial cell defects alone are 
unlikely to explain life-threatening haemorrhage in patients on VEGF/VEGFR-
targeted therapy for squamous cell lung cancer and certain other solid tumours.  
Rather, weakening of the wall of major vessels by tumour erosion, necrosis, 
cavitation, or other concurrent pathological conditions are likely to play a central 
role (Kamba and McDonald, 2007).
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical trials. In randomised clinical trials, 
haemorrhage was reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
The incidence of haemorrhagic events with TKIs varies significantly among 
patients with different types of tumours.  The highest RRs of all grade 
haemorrhagic events were observed in patients with gastrointestinal stromal 
tumour (RR, 14.71; 95% CI: 0.89 – 244.21), although the increased risk was not 
statistically significant, while the lowest RRs were found in patients with small-
cell lung cancer (RR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.10 – 2.66).  Additionally, a significantly 
increased risk of all-grade haemorrhagic events was observed in metastatic breast 
cancer (RR, 4.04; 95% CI: 2.62 – 6.20), RCC (RR, 2.45; 95% CI: 1.35 – 4.45) 
and primitive neuroectodermal tumour (RR, 4.20, 95% CI: 1.48 – 11.95).  As for 
high-grade haemorrhagic events, the highest RRs were observed in patients with 
Eisai

Lenvatinib
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
melanoma (RR, 6.73; 95% CI: 0.83 – 54.5), while the lowest RRs were observed 
in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (RR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.24 – 1.09) 
(Qi, et al., 2013a).
In patients with chronic liver disease, the risk of post-procedure bleeding for so-
called minimally invasive procedures is approximately 20% (Caldwell, 2014).
The majority of intracranial haemorrhagic events in the lenvatinib clinical 
database were associated with the presence of tumour in the area of the bleed.  
These events were also often associated with the confounding factor of 
hypertension.  Fatal intracranial haemorrhagic events were observed in subjects 
with or without brain metastasis..
Preventability
In the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, adjustments, or permanent 
discontinuation may be necessary.
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product:
Routine risk minimisation measures have been put in place.  The impact of 
haemorrhage on the individual patient would depend on the site and severity of 
bleeding.
Public health impact:
Not identified
Identified Risk:  Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs)
Potential mechanisms:
Arterial thromboembolic events are well known side effects associated with 
treatment with TKIs (Chen and Cleck, 2009).
Accelerated atherogenesis and thrombogenesis is purported to be triggered by 
drug-induced endothelial damage, which leads to cellular apoptosis and the 
formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which shifts the endothelium to have 
procoagulant properties by exposing subendothelial factors and Von Willebrand 
factor, which activated the coagulation cascade (Conti, et al., 2013). 
Inhibition of VEGF could diminish the regenerative capacity of endothelial cells 
and cause defects that expose pro-coagulant phospholipids on the luminal plasma 
membrane or underlying matrix, leading to thrombosis (Kilickap, et al., 2003). 
Reduction in NO and PGI2 after inhibition of VEGF signaling may predispose to 
thromboembolic events.  VEGF inhibition may also increase risk of thrombosis 
by increasing hematocrit and blood viscosity via overproduction of erythropoietin 
(Spivak, 2002; Tam, et al., 2006).
Evidence source(s) and
strength of evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical trials. In randomised clinical trials ATEs were 
reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.

disease.  Lenvatinib has not been studied in patients who have had an ATE within 
the previous 6 months.
Although there are cases with prior medical history of hypertension, obesity, 
hypercholesterolemia, and smoking that could predispose them to ATEs, and 
some cases were assessed as not related to lenvatinib, a causal relationship to

lenvatinib may exist.  This is consistent with the reported side effect profile of the 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted agents (Chen and Cleck, 2009).
RCC 
Subjects with RCC are predominantly older, overweight males with underlying 
risk factors of hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus, all of which are known risk factors associated with thromboembolic 
events.  Additionally, RCC subjects are at a higher risk of developing chronic 
kidney disease, which is independently associated with increased cardiovascular 
risk due to dysregulation of lipid metabolism and contribution to atherosclerosis. 
(Chang et al., 2014; Ferro et al., 2018).
There are no established data on prevention to date, except for vigilance by 
review and collection of patient history, CV risk profile, and scores, and 
measuring and monitoring cardiac ischemia blood markers (Conti, et al., 2013).
Risk factors associated with thromboembolic events include age ≥65 years, 
smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, atrial fibrillation, 
hyperlipidemia, and prior thromboembolic disease.  Lenvatinib has not been 
studied in patients who have had an ATE within the previous 6 months.
Routine risk minimisation measures in place.
This event could have a significant impact on the individual patient’s quality of 
life; however, with the proposed monitoring and dose adjustment schedule the 
risk of this event is low.

Identified Risk:  QTc Prolongation
Potential mechanisms:
QTc prolongation has been observed with other VEGF/VEGFR-targeted 
therapies (Chen and Cleck, 2009).
Although other mitigating factors may have contributed to the QTc prolongation 
per SMQ, including prior history (eg, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and thyroid 
disease) and electrolyte alterations, there does appear to be an association of QTc 
prolongation and the administration of lenvatinib. 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Evidence from randomised clinical trials. In randomised clinical trials, QT/QTC 
prolongation was reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.

Severity and nature of risk

All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):
Grade 4 occurrences of QTc prolongation were reported in 1 subject (0.2%).  A 
higher percentage of subjects had TEAEs reported for QTc prolongation per 
SMQ that led to dose interruption (3.1%) than to dose reduction (0.4%).  Three 
subjects (0.7%) discontinued treatment due to QTc prolongation.
Most events for QTc prolongation per SMQ were sporadic and resolved; there 
was no recurrence when the lenvatinib dose was reduced and no other 
intervention was required.  Moreover, there were no reports of ventricular 
tachycardia or torsades de pointes in the lenvatinib clinical studies.
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):
No Grade 4 or 5 occurrences of QTc prolongation were reported, and no subjects 
discontinued treatment.  Four subjects (0.8%) had TEAEs reported for QTc 
prolongation that led to dose interruption.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496): 
Grade 3 QTc prolongation events occurred in 5 subjects (1.0%).  No Grade 4 or 
Grade 5 events were recorded, and no subjects discontinued treatment. One 
subject required a dose reduction due to a QTc prolongation event.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  No Grade 4 or 5 occurrences of 
QTc prolongation were reported.  One subject (0.2%) had TEAEs reported for 
QTc prolongation that led to dose reduction and 2 subjects (0.4%) had TEAEs 
reported for QTc prolongation that led to dose interruption.  Treatment was 
discontinued in 1 subject (0.2%) due to QTc prolongation. 
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  No Grade 4 or Grade

If a subject had more than 1 TEAE, the subject is only counted once at the

A subject may be counted in both categories if the subject had TEAEs leading to

Many subjects with QTc prolongation had prior identified risk factors such as 
hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, arterial hypertension, and obesity.  Many 
subjects had electrolyte alterations (eg, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia, and 
hypokalemia) or concurrent cardiovascular disease (eg, myocarditis, 
cardiomyopathy and acute cardiac failure) at the time of the QTc prolongation 
event.
All occurrences of maximum QTc prolongation >500 ms and >60 ms increases in 
QTcF from baseline were single, isolated episodes.  Moreover, a thorough QT 
study concluded that lenvatinib does not exert a clinically relevant effect on 
QTcF.
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be monitored in patients with congenital long 
QT syndrome, CHF, or bradyarrhythmias, as well as in those receiving drugs 
known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. 
Electrolyte abnormalities should be monitored and corrected in all patients.
Routine risk minimisation measures in place.

Not identified
Identified Risk:  Hypothyroidism
Potential mechanisms: The precise mechanism of action of TKI-mediated thyroid dysfunction has not been 
fully elucidated.  Many mechanisms have been proposed including their induction 
of thyroiditis, capillary regression in the thyroid gland, antithyroid peroxidase 
antibody production, and their ability to decrease iodine uptake by the thyroid gland 
(Ahmadieh and Salti, 2013).
RCC/HCC
Thyroid dysfunction is a known class effect of TKIs (Ahmadieh and Salti, 2013).  
Of note, subjects in the RCC Safety Set and HCC Safety Set had intact thyroids and 
the majority of subjects were not receiving thyroid replacement therapy; therefore, 
it appeared that lenvatinib had a direct effect on the thyroid gland. 
DTC
Lenvatinib impairs TSH suppression in patients receiving exogenous thyroid 
hormone supplementation.
In a study of the side effects of broad-acting TKIs, one mechanism to explain 
worsening TSH elevation in postthyroidectomy patients would be an indirect effect 
of TKI (sunitinib) on the metabolism of thyroid hormone, or with thyroid hormone 
action at the pituitary level. It is plausible that the different types of TKIs have more 
than one mechanism affecting thyroid functions, but it remains more likely that 
there is a universal drug class effect of these medications that has yet to be clarified 
(Lodish and Stratakis, 2010).
Evidence source(s) 
and strength of 
evidence:
Randomised clinical trials.  In randomised clinical trials events of blood thyroid 
stimulating hormone increased were reported in more patients treated with 
lenvatinib than placebo and there were reports of hypothyroidism in patients treated 
with lenvatinib.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Subjects with DTC who have undergone thyroidectomy and are receiving thyroid 
replacement therapy could develop low TSH due to thyroxin substitution.  It is 
possible that treatment with lenvatinib may exacerbate thyroid dysfunction due to a 
direct effect on TSH levels.
Combination with Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which may trigger immune-
related reactions.  Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism 
and thyroiditis, have been reported in patients receiving pembrolizumab (Keytruda 
SmPC).  In the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination safety sets, the 
incidence of hypothyroidism events was significantly increased although the vast 
majority were low grade and readily manageable with thyroid hormone replacement 
or dose modification, if appropriate, and are therefore, of limited clinical 
significance.
RCC (Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab)
Asian subjects had a higher incidence of hypothyroidism (67.9%) than White 
subjects (52.7%).

subjects (24.5%).
Preventability
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be monitored on a regular basis 
and thyroid hormone administration should be adjusted to reach appropriate TSH 
levels, according to the patient’s therapeutic target.
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product:
Public health impact:
Routine risk minimisation measures in place.
Patients may require exogenous thyroid supplementation and thyroid function 
testing with consequent use of health service resources.
Identified Risk:  Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation and Fistula Formation
Potential mechanisms:
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation are well known AEs associated 
with treatment with TKIs (Chen and Cleck, 2009).  A number of effects on local 
tissues by VEGF blockage, including hypoxia and impaired wound healing, 
could increase the risk of bowel perforation and fistula formation in the setting of 
tumour involvement or bowel inflammation.
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Evidence from randomized clinical trials.  In randomized clinical trials events of 
gastrointestinal perforation or fistula were reported in more patients treated with 
lenvatinib than placebo.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
In the majority of cases, perforation occurred in subjects with evidence of intra-
abdominal malignant disease, but in some cases, GI perforation was not 
associated with apparent intra-abdominal tumour.  Gastrointestinal perforations 
were also noted to occur in subjects who were ≥65 years of age.
Events of fistulae formation involving the GI tract have been reported, with the 
majority of these events occurring in areas of local tumour involvement. 
Multiple confounding factors were present in subjects with GI perforation and 
fistula formation events.  Many of these subjects had a medical history of GI 
Eisai

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
bleed, gallstones, rectal abscess, diverticulitis, vaginal mass, diverticulosis of the 
large intestine, and colon resection for colon cancer.  Subjects with esophageal or 
tracheal fistula had prior neck surgery such as thyroidectomy and neck lymph 
node dissection.  Many subjects also had prior medical history of surgery or 
radiotherapy.  Some relevant comorbidities reported were abdominal or stomach 
pain, infections (pelvic abscess or peritonitis), and diarrhea.
Patients with liver cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis, a severe and often fatal infection.  The incidence of 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in these patients ranges from 10% to 30% and 
mortality from 10% to 46% in hospitalised patients (Dever and Sheikh, 2015).
According to Chen and Cleck (2009), cancer risks include colorectal, ovarian, 
and gastric cancer.  Non-cancer risks include diverticulitis, ulcer, infection, 
obstruction, prior surgery, ischemic bowel, and prior radiotherapy.
In most cases, GI perforation and fistula formation occurred in subjects with risk 
factors such as prior surgery or radiotherapy.  In the case of a GI perforation or 
fistula formation, dose interruptions, adjustments, or permanent discontinuation 
may be necessary.
Routine risk minimisation measures in place.

Not identified
Identified Risk:  Non-Gastrointestinal Fistula Formation (any fistula which does not

Potential mechanisms:
Potential mechanisms:
The potential mechanism of non-GI fistula formation is assumed to be similar to
that of GI perforation and fistula formation, which are well known AEs associated 
with treatment with TKIs (Chen and Cleck, 2009).  A number of effects on local 
tissues by VEGF blockage, including hypoxia and impaired wound healing, could 
increase the risk of bowel perforation and fistula formation in the setting of tumour 
involvement or bowel inflammation.
Lenvatinib inhibits VEGF- and FGF-driven angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and 
has a direct antitumour effect on some types of tumours through its actions on 
VEGFR1-3, FGFR1-4, KIT, PDGFRα, and RET.  There is a potential that 
lenvatinib-responsive lung metastases may undergo marked tumour shrinkage 
which, depending on their positions and health of the surrounding pulmonary 
tissue, could result in pneumothoraces or bronchopulmonary fistula.  The same 
process may apply to lenvatinib-responsive metastases in other organs, resulting in 
fistulae or bowel perforations.
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Postmarketing reports of Non-Gastrointestinal Fistula Formation and 
pneumothorax in association with lenvatinib have been received.

All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  There were 2 events of 
pneumothorax; 1 was Grade 2 and 1 was Grade 3 (also an SAE).
Prior surgery or radiotherapy may be risk factors for the development of non-GI 
fistulae and pneumothorax.  Patients with pre-existing fistulae treated with 
lenvatinib are at increased risk of worsening, and some reactions have resulted in 
fatal haemorrhage.
Data from ongoing studies in solid tumours indicates that the risk of 
pneumothorax may be higher in certain types of tumours such as soft tissue 
sarcoma, possibly due to their predilection for lung metastasis.  It is possible that 
cavitation of lung tumours associated with high therapeutic response to lenvatinib 
may also contribute to the risk of pneumothorax.  Some reports of gastrointestinal 
perforation, fistula and pneumothorax occurred in association with tumour 
regression or necrosis.
Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Preventability
Lenvatinib should not be started in patients with fistula to avoid worsening and 
lenvatinib should be permanently discontinued in patients with oesophageal or 
tracheobronchial tract involvement and any Grade 4 fistula.

Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product:
Routine risk minimisation measures in place.
Public health impact:
Not identified
Important Potential Risk:  Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs)
Potential mechanisms:
Although an association between VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies and VTEs 
has not been established, a mechanism has been hypothesised as follows:  
Angiogenesis-induced VTEs may be directly related to inhibitory effect on 
VEGF signaling pathway: angiogenesis inhibitors can disrupt the regenerative 
capacity of endothelial cells (ECs) and cause vascular wall defects, exposing 
prothrombotic phospholipids on the luminal plasma membrane and the 
underlying matrix, thus leading to thrombosis.  In addition, reduction in NO and 
prostaglandin I2 (PG I2) by a VEGF inhibitor can also predispose to thrombosis 
(Qi, et al., 2013b).
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Randomised clinical trials.  In randomised clinical trials events of pulmonary 
embolism were reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo and 
there is a recognised potential class effect.

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Risk factors associated with VTEs include underlying malignant disease, age 
≥65 years, and immobility.
In the lenvatinib clinical database, the incidence (approximately 5%) of VTEs per 
SGQ did not differ much among the groups, including placebo, indicating that 
there is a significant background rate of these events in this population.  All 
subjects had extensive malignant disease at study entry and this might constitute 
the major predisposing factor.  This observation is consistent with published data 
Eisai

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
showing that the risk of VTEs associated with TKIs is likely to be due to the 
underlying malignancy (Qi, et al., 2013b).  A number of subjects also had 
predisposing factors including prior medical history of hypertension, diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, and obesity, and most of the women were in the postmenopausal 
age group.  Lastly, at the time of the event, a number of subjects were 
hospitalised for various SAEs (infection, renal disorder, surgery); thus, 
immobilisation could have contributed to venous stasis, leading to deep vein 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
Portal vein thrombosis is common in patients with HCC (up to a 40% incidence 
at the time of diagnosis) and is associated with a poor prognosis (Quirk, et al., 
2015).
Published data show that the risk of VTEs associated with TKIs is likely to be 
due to the underlying malignancy (Qi, et al., 2013b) rather than VEGF/VEGFR-
targeted therapies.
Routine pharmacovigilance in place; if the risk is further characterised it is 
unlikely to have an impact on the risk-benefit of the product. 
These events could have a significant impact on public health; however, an 
association with lenvatinib has not been established.

Potential mechanisms:
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Characterisation of the 
risk:
The mechanism of potential abnormal pregnancy is unclear, although it may be 
related to the antiangiogenic properties of lenvatinib.  Embryo-foetal toxicities 
including skeletal malformations at multiple sites, reduced ossification, 
generalised oedema and microhepatia have been documented in animal studies 
with other TKIs, suggestive of abnormal pregnancy as a class effect among 
TKIs (Abruzzese, et al., 2014).
Nonclinical data.  There are insufficient clinical data to exclude a risk.

Frequency
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  Treatment-emergent AEs of abnormal 
pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk were reported in 
0.4% of subjects (n=2; chloasma and porokeratosis [1 subject each]).  However 
these reports are not relevant as all of these subjects are male.
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  A TEAE of abnormal 
pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk SMQ was 
reported in 0.2% of subjects (n=1; subgaleal haematoma).
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  There were no reported TEAEs of 
abnormal pregnancy outcome or excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  A TEAE of abnormal 
pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk SGQ was reported 
in 0.2% of subjects (n=1; epidermolysis).  
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  TEAEs of abnormal 
pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk SGQ were 
reported in 1.3% of subjects (n=7).  The most frequent event was failure to 
thrive in 0.8% of subjects (n=4).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Although the protocols for lenvatinib clinical studies require that female 
subjects of childbearing potential use an acceptable method of contraception, 
1 case of pregnancy has been recorded during the clinical development of 
lenvatinib: a healthy, 37-year old black woman who had a positive pregnancy 
test 5 days after administration of the third of 3 single 10 mg doses administered 
in a PK study over the course of 3 weeks.
It is currently unknown whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk.  
Lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.

Seriousness/outcomes
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  There were no SAEs of abnormal 
pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk.
The event of pregnancy was deemed to be serious, and the subject had an 
outcome of a confirmed spontaneous abortion 14 days after receiving the third 
and final dose of lenvatinib.  The subject was subsequently lost to follow up and 
no further information was available.
There were no SAEs of abnormal pregnancy outcome and excretion of 
lenvatinib in breast milk in the All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety 
Set.
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  There were 2 SAEs 
(0.4%; failure to thrive) of abnormal pregnancy outcome and excretion of 
lenvatinib in breast milk SGQ. 

Severity and nature of risk
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  There were 2 TEAEs of abnormal 
pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk (chloasma and 
porokeratosis); these were both Grade 1.
The event of pregnancy recorded during the clinical development of lenvatinib 
was deemed severe, and possibly related to study drug.
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  There was 1 TEAE of 
abnormal pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk 
(subgaleal haematoma), the grade was missing.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  There was 1 TEAE of 
abnormal pregnancy outcome and excretion of lenvatinib in breast milk SGQ 
(epidermolysis), which was Grade 1 in severity.  
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  There were 3 subjects 
with Grade 3 TEAEs of abnormal pregnancy outcome and excretion of 
lenvatinib in breast milk SGQ; these TEAEs were failure to thrive (n=2) and 
muscular dystrophy (n=1).
Women of childbearing potential and lactating females.
Lenvatinib should not be administered to pregnant women, unless clearly 
necessary and after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the 
risk to the foetus.  Women of childbearing age should avoid becoming pregnant 
and use effective contraception during treatment with lenvatinib and for at least 
one month after finishing treatment.
It is not known whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk.  Lenvatinib and its 
metabolites are excreted in rat milk.  A risk to newborns or infants cannot be 
excluded and, therefore, lenvatinib should not be used during breastfeeding.

Important Potential Risk:  Male and female fertility
Potential mechanisms:
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Characterisation of the 
risk:
The changes observed in male and female reproductive organs are considered 
class effects due to the pharmacologic activity of lenvatinib. 
In males, the VEGF receptor has an important role in maintaining the function 
of testicular microvasculature and in regulating the initial stages of the process 
of spermatogonial proliferation and spermatogenesis (Ergün, et al., 1997; 
Nalbandian, et al., 2003).
Nonclinical data.  There are insufficient clinical data to exclude a risk.

Frequency
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  Treatment-emergent AEs of male and 
female fertility were reported in 1.1% of subjects (n=5).  TEAEs included 
hypogonadism (n=2), amenorrhea (n=1), menstruation irregular (n=1), and 
varicocele (n=1). 
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  There were no reported 
TEAEs of male and female fertility.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  Treatment-emergent AEs of male and 
female fertility were reported in 1 subject (0.2%).  The TEAE was menstruation 
irregular.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  A TEAE of male and female 
fertility was reported in 0.2% of subjects (n=1; irregular menstruation in a 48-
year old female subject at study entry). 
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  There were no 
reported TEAEs of female fertility SGQ.
Post-authorisation events of male and female fertility have been in accordance 
with the safety profile of lenvatinib in clinical trials.

Seriousness/outcomes
There were no reported SAEs of male and female fertility in either the All DTC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set, the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, or the HCC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set.
There were no reported SAEs of male and female fertility SGQ in the All RCC 
Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set.

Severity and nature of risk
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  Treatment-emergent AEs of male and 
female fertility were mainly Grade 1 or Grade 2 (2 subjects [0.4%] for each 
Grade). Grade 3 male and female fertility was reported in 1 subject (0.2%).
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  There were no reported 
TEAEs of male and female fertility.
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  The reported TEAE of male and female 
fertility was Grade 3.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  The reported TEAE of male 
and female fertility SGQ was Grade 1. 
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  There were no 
reported TEAEs of female fertility SGQ.
No specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate 
the effect on fertility.  However, in repeated-dose studies in animals testicular 
(hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium) and ovarian changes (follicular

atresia) were observed at exposures 11 to 15 times (rat) or 0.6 to 7 times 
(monkey) the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the maximum 
recommended human dose.  These findings were reversible at the end of a 4-
week recovery period. 
Men and women of reproductive age
The nonclinical evidence of reversibility and the absence of degenerative 
effects, suggests that any impairment of fertility in males or females would be 
short-term; hence, sperm or egg cryopreservation for patients is not considered 
necessary for lenvatinib patients.
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product:
Routine pharmacovigilance monitoring in place.  Further characterisation is 
considered unlikely to have a significant impact on the risk-benefit balance of 
the product.
Public health impact:
None identified
Important Potential Risk:  Bone and teeth abnormalities in the paediatric population
Potential mechanisms:
VEGF is an essential coordinator of chondrocyte death, chondroclast function, 
extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and bone formation in the growth 
plate (Gerber, et al., 1999b).  VEGF is also actively responsible for hypertrophic 
cartilage neovascularization through a paracrine release by chondrocytes 
(Carlevaro, et al., 2000).  
The expression of VEGFR-2 has been shown to be positive in dental pulp 
odontoblasts in primary teeth in humans and more uniformly in young 
permanent teeth.  VEGF may therefore play a role in permanent tooth 
development and maturation (Mattuella, et al., 2007).
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Nonclinical data.  There are currently insufficient clinical data to exclude or 
confirm a risk.
Characterisation of the 
risk:
Not applicable.  There are insufficient data to characterise the risk.

Important Potential Risk:  Impaired wound healing
Potential mechanisms:
Wound healing is a complex process involving angiogenesis and closely 
regulated interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, and the coagulation 
cascade.  Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has a diverse effect on local tissues 
that could disrupt the normal healing process.  Antiangiogenic agents are known 
to delay cutaneous wound healing in a dose-dependent manner in animal models 
(Chen and Cleck, 2009).

Characterisation of the 
risk:

Frequency
All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=458):  Impaired wound healing was reported 
in 1.3% of subjects (n=6).
RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  Impaired wound healing 
was reported in 3 subjects (0.5%).
HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (N=496):  Impaired wound healing was reported in 
1 subject (0.2%).
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab (N=497):  A TEAE of impaired wound 
healing SGQ was reported in 0.2% of subjects (n=1; impaired healing). 
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  An event of impaired 
wound healing SGQ was reported in 1 subject (0.2%).
Post-authorisation events of impaired wound healing have been in accordance 
with the safety profile of lenvatinib in clinical trials.

Seriousness/outcomes
One event of Grade 3 impaired wound healing involving a chest wall mass was 
serious and resulted in hospitalization of the subject and discontinuation of the 
treatment, after which the event resolved.
One Grade 3 event of nonserious impaired wound healing occurred in a subject 
in the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set (wound healing delayed at left tibia).  The 
event was initially reported at Grade 1 and did not resolve, resulting in study 
drug discontinuation and the subject being withdrawn from the study.
No SAEs of impaired wound healing SMQ and no Grade 5 events were reported 
in the All RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set.
No SAEs of impaired wound healing SGQ and no Grade 5 events were reported 
in the All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set. 
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  An event of Grade 2 
impaired healing was reported in 1 subject (0.2%), which was resolved without 
any treatment modification.

Severity and nature of risk
The majority of events of impaired wound healing were Grade 1 or 2; 1 Grade 3 
event was reported in the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set and the HCC 
Lenvatinib Safety Set.
The TEAE of impaired wound healing was Grade 1 in the All RCC Lenvatinib + 
Everolimus Safety Set.
The TEAE of impaired healing was Grade 2 in severity in the All RCC 
Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set.
Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Surgery or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of treatment with a VEGF/VEGFR 
targeted therapy.
Preventability
Patients with major surgery within the 3 to 4 weeks prior to study entry were 
excluded from the lenvatinib clinical trials as a precaution and in Study 307
those who had not recovered adequately from ensuing toxicity and/or 
complications were also excluded; therefore, clinical evidence regarding this 
risk is limited.  Of the few cases observed, none was life-threatening and all 
resolved.  The risk factors (prior surgery or radiotherapy) are already noted in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC as being implicated in GI perforation and fistula 
formation; hence, this risk is essentially covered in the product information.
Eisai
Page 116 of 163
Lenvatinib
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product:
Routine pharmacovigilance monitoring in place; impaired wound healing could 
have a substantial effect on an individual patient’s recovery but is considered 
unlikely to have significant impact on the risk-benefit profile of the product. 
Public health impact:
Patients with impaired wound healing may use additional health service 
resources. 
Important Potential Risk:  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)-like Conditions
Potential mechanisms:
The mechanism of EGFR-TKI-induced ILD is currently unclear.  In a murine 
model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, gefitinib therapy may augment 
any underlying pulmonary fibrosis via a decrease in EGFR phosphorylation with 
a coincident decrease in regenerative epithelial proliferation.  Additionally, 
inhibition of EGFR signaling by EGFR TKIs may impair the repair of pulmonary 
injury (Shi, et al., 2014).
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
“Interstitial lung disease-like events” have been reported for several other 
medicinal products from the same pharmacological class.
Characterisation of the 
risk:

Frequency
In a review of ILD-like conditions for lenvatinib, no events of ILD were reported 
across the pooled analysis of safety data from clinical trials with lenvatinib 
(including 458 subjects with RAI-refractory DTC and 656 subjects with other 
tumour types).
In the All DTC Safety Set, ILD-like conditions such as pneumonitis and lung 
infiltration were reported in 6 subjects (1.3%).  In the Non-DTC, Non-HCC 
monotherapy Safety Set, ILD-like conditions were reported in 4 subjects (0.6%).  
In the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, ILD-like conditions were 
reported in 43 subjects (6.9%).  These events included pneumonitis (n=30), 
interstitial lung disease (n=10), and bronchiolitis, lung infiltration, and lung 
opacity (n=1 for each).
In the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, ILD-like conditions were reported in 
3 subjects (0.6%).
In the All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=497), ILD-like 
conditions were reported in 24 subjects (4.8%).  These events included 
pneumonitis in 4.0% of subjects (n=20), lung infiltration in 0.4% of subjects 
(n=2), and eosinophilia myalgia syndrome and interstitial lung disease each in 
0.2% of subjects (n=1).
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  TEAEs of ILD-like 
conditions SMQ were reported in 9 subjects (1.7%).  The most frequent ILD-like 
event was pneumonitis reported in 1.3% of subjects (n=7).
Post-authorisation events of ILD-like conditions have been in accordance with 
the safety profile of lenvatinib in clinical trials.

Seriousness/outcomes
ILD-like conditions were mainly Grade 1 or 2, with 1 Grade 3 event of 
pneumonitis reported from the Non-DTC, Non-HCC monotherapy Safety Set.  
Four events of pneumonitis were reported: 3 from the All DTC Lenvatinib Safety 
Set (2 Grade 2 events, and 1 Grade 1 event); and 1 Grade 3 event from the Non-
DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy Safety Set.  Three events of lung infiltration were 
reported, 2 Grade 2 events from the All DTC set and 1 Grade 1 event from the 
Non-DTC, Non-HCC Monotherapy Safety Set.
In the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, ILD-like conditions were 
Grade 1 or 2 (22 Grade 1 and 18 Grade 2).  There were 3 events of Grade 3

severity. 
In the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, there was 1 event each of Grade 1, Grade 2, 
and Grade 3 severity.  Events of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and necrotizing 
bronchiolitis were reported in the same subject, and additionally 1 event each of 
pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis was reported in individual subjects.
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  TEAEs of ILD-like 
SMQ conditions were Grade 2 or 3 (4 subjects [0.8%] for each Grade).  Seven 
events of pneumonitis were reported (1 Grade 1, 3 Grade 2, and 3 Grade 3) and 
2 events of immune-mediated pneumonitis (1 Grade 2 and 1 Grade 3) were 
reported.

Severity and nature of risk
In the All DTC Safety Set there was 1 subject who had an SAE of pneumonitis, 
which did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and this event resolved with no 
sequelae of death.  No dose reductions of lenvatinib were necessary and only 
1 subject required treatment interruption.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set (N=623):  Four subjects had SAEs 
of ILD-like conditions SMQ.  Two subjects (0.4%) had a dose reduction and 
9 subjects (1.7%) had a dose interruption due to ILD-like conditions.  Treatment 
was discontinued in 3 subjects (0.6%).
In the HCC Lenvatinib Safety Set, there was 1 subject who had an SAE of 
pneumonitis, which resulted in hospitalization and interruption of study drug.  
Following improvement of the pneumonitis, study drug was resumed at the 
original dose.
All RCC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=497):  One subject (0.2%) 
died due to an ILD-like condition SMQ (pneumonitis).  SAEs were reported in 
2.4% of subjects (n=12).  One subject (0.2%) had a dose reduction of lenvatinib 
and 6 subjects (1.2%) had a dose interruption of lenvatinib due to ILD-like 
conditions.  Lenvatinib treatment was discontinued in 3 subjects (0.6%).
All EC Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab Safety Set (N=530):  Four subjects had 
SAEs of ILD-like conditions SMQ (pneumonitis).  Lenvatinib was interrupted in 
4 subjects (0.8%) and discontinued in 1 subject (0.2%).

Risk factors and risk 
groups:
Patients with underlying respiratory disorders may be at higher risk of developing 
ILD-like events with lenvatinib treatment.
Combination with Pembrolizumab:
Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which may trigger immune-
related reactions.  Pneumonitis (including ILD and organizing pneumonia) has 
been reported in subjects receiving pembrolizumab and is an ADR of 
pembrolizumab (Keytruda SmPC).
Combination with everolimus 
Eisai
Page 119 of 163
Lenvatinib
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
Everolimus is a selective mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor.  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including 
everolimus.  Non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) has 
been frequently reported in patients receiving everolimus and is an ADR of 
everolimus (see Afinitor SmPC).
The development of ILD-like events such as pneumonitis should be monitored 
and managed in patients.  Pneumonitis is a potentially life-threatening condition 
and may require urgent intervention.
Preventability
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product:
Routine pharmacovigilance monitoring in place; If severe, ILD-like events can 
have a substantial negative effect on patient quality of life due to symptoms such 
as dyspnea, tachypnoea, fatigue, and dizziness but considered unlikely to have 
significant impact of the risk-benefit profile of the product. 
Public health impact:
None identified
Important Potential Risk:  Overdose (concomitant everolimus) (RCC)
Potential mechanisms:
Not applicable.
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence:
Primarily based on potential for dosing errors as dose of everolimus when used 
concomitantly with lenvatinib is lower than when everolimus is used alone; there 
was one report of concomitant everolimus overdose involving a single 
administration in randomised clinical trials. 
Characterisation of the 
risk:

Frequency
In the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, everolimus overdose was 
recorded in 4 subjects (0.6%).  Two subjects in Study 307 had a planned dose of 
0 mg and took 5 mg for 1 day.  At a planned dose of 5 mg, 1 subject in 
Study 205 took 10 mg for 1 day and 1 subject in Study 307 took 10 mg for 
4 days.

Seriousness/outcomes
No AEs were reported as a result of overdose.
Severity and nature of risk

Unknown, no AEs were reported.
Molecularly targeted drugs given in combination are usually administered at a 
dosage lower than that of their individual monotherapies, so one might expect 
physicians and pharmacists prescribing or dispensing such drugs to be alert to 
this risk.  If a prescribing error did occur which was not detected at the point of 
dispensing, then it is conceivable that a patient might receive a combination dose 
of 18 mg lenvatinib + 10 mg everolimus unchecked for several weeks.  
Patients commencing this combination therapy (who would be at most at risk of 
such a medication error) are closely monitored on a weekly (BP) then fortnightly 
(BP and liver function) basis for the first 2 months of treatment, hence it seems 
unlikely that a medication error would go unchecked for longer than 2 weeks.

Missing information:  Long-term use
Evidence source: 
Adverse events may emerge during long-term treatment and there are 
limited long-term safety data in subjects in the RCC study (Lenvatinib + 
Everolimus combination).  A total of 22 subjects in the RCC Lenvatinib 
+ Everolimus Safety Set had received treatment for >12 months and
5 subjects had received treatment for >24 months at the time the RCC
indication was initially approved. A total of 253 subjects in the RCC
Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set have currently received treatment
for >12 months, with 74 subjects having received treatment for
>24 months.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for Lenvima / Kisplyx (lenvatinib)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lenvima/Kisplyx.  The RMP 
details important risks of Lenvima/Kisplyx, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about the risks and uncertainties (missing information) 
associated with Lenvima/Kisplyx.
The summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Lenvima/Kisplyx and its package leaflet 
(PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Lenvima/Kisplyx should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Lenvima/Kisplyx should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the 
RMP for Lenvima/Kisplyx.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Lenvima/Kisplyx is authorised as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
progressive, locally advanced DTC and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or 
unresectable HCC who have received no prior systemic therapy.  Kisplyx is indicated in 
combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC, Kisplyx
is indicated in combination with pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of adult patients 
with advanced RCC.  Lenvima is indicated in combination with pembrolizumab in adult 
patients with advanced EC who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in 
any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.  It contains lenvatinib 
mesilate as the active substance and it is given orally once daily.
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Lenvima/Kisplyx can be found in 
the EPAR, including a plain-language summary, available on the EMA website under the 
medicine’s webpage (web link to be provided by EMA).
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of Lenvima/Kisplyx, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about the risks of Lenvima/Kisplyx are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
Eisai
Page 132 of 163
Lenvatinib
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan
• The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or
without prescription) can help minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lenvima/Kisplyx is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Lenvima/Kisplyx are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Lenvima/Kisplyx.  Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Important Identified Risk:  Proteinuria and Nephrotic Syndrome
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Evidence from randomised clinical studies.  In randomised clinical trials 
proteinuria was reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.  
Nephrotic syndrome was identified from post-marketing surveillance and the 
pathological mechanism is similar to that of proteinuria. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
DTC
The presence of hypertension during lenvatinib treatment appeared to be 
correlated with the development of protein in the urine (proteinuria).  In 
addition, proteinuria was more common in women, Asians, people aged 
75 years or more, and people with diabetes and kidney problems.
RCC
Proteinuria was more common in men and in those people with hypertension.
Routine risk minimisation measures:



See section II.C of this summary for an overview of the post-authorisation 
development plan.
Important Identified Risk:  Renal Failure or Impairment
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Evidence from randomised clinical studies.  In randomised clinical trials renal 
failure and impairment was reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than 
placebo.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
Risk factors associated with renal impairment or failure in patients receiving 
lenvatinib included underlying chronic renal impairment, adrenal mass, sepsis, 
and dehydration and/or hypovolemia.  The main risk factor for kidney failure or 
injury is dehydration (excessive loss of body water) resulting from diarrhoea or 
vomiting.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
In randomised clinical trials decreased ejection fraction/cardiac failure was 
reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.
Most of the patients affected with heart failure during treatment with lenvatinib
had other risk factors such as pre-existing heart disease, breathing difficulties, 
obesity, trouble with blood sugar control (diabetes mellitus), high BP, and prior 
anthracycline use (a type of chemotherapy drug).

A small number of events of PRES were reported in patients treated with 
lenvatinib and PRES is a known effect associated with other antiangiogenic 
agents. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
Blood pressure is elevated from baseline in most patients and systemic
hypertension is a major risk factor.  There are multiple well-defined conditions 
that can cause PRES in cancer patients, including hypertension and renal 
dysfunction, as can immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic drugs, bone 
marrow/stem cell transplants, corticosteroids, and growth factors.

Important Identified Risk:  Hepatotoxicity
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
In randomised clinical trials liver-related reactions were reported in more 
patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
Multiple confounding factors were observed in subjects in the clinical trial 
program, such as the presence of liver metastases or progression of preexisting 
liver metastases, concurrent medications, and contributing comorbidities.  
However, there were a few cases without any confounding factors that occurred 
shortly after the start of treatment with lenvatinib and that resolved upon 
discontinuation of lenvatinib.

Risk factors and risk 
groups
The majority of intracranial haemorrhagic events in the lenvatinib clinical 
database were associated with the presence of tumour in the area of the bleed.  
These events were also often associated with the confounding factor of 
hypertension.

Important Identified Risk:  QTc Prolongation
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
In randomised clinical trials QT/QTc prolongation was reported in more 
patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
Many of the patients who had QTc prolongation also had risk factors such as 
hypocalcaemia (low calcium), hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), arterial 
hypertension, and obesity, and many patients had changes in their body salt 
balance at the time of the event.

Important Identified Risk:  Hypothyroidism
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
In randomised clinical trials events of blood thyroid stimulating hormone 
increased were reported in more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo 
and there were reports of hypothyroidism in patients treated with lenvatinib.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Subjects with DTC who have undergone thyroidectomy and are receiving 
thyroid replacement therapy could develop low TSH due to thyroxine 
substitution.  It is possible that treatment with lenvatinib may exacerbate 
thyroid dysfunction due to a direct effect on TSH levels.

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
In randomised clinical trials events of GI perforation or fistula were reported in 
more patients treated with lenvatinib than placebo.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimisation 
measures
The majority of these events occurred in areas of local tumour involvement.  
Many of the subjects had a medical history of GI bleed, gallstones, rectal 
abscess, diverticulitis, vaginal mass, diverticulosis of the large intestine, and 
colon resection for colon cancer.  Subjects with oesophageal or tracheal fistula 
had prior neck surgery such as thyroidectomy and neck lymph node dissection.

Important Identified Risk:  Non-Gastrointestinal (GI) Fistula Formation and 
Pneumothorax
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Post-marketing reports of non-gastrointestinal fistula formation and 
pneumothorax in association with lenvatinib have been received. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Prior surgery or radiotherapy may be risk factors for the development of non-
GI fistulae.  Patients with pre-existing fistulae treated with lenvatinib are at 
increased risk of worsening.  Data from ongoing studies in solid tumours 
indicates that the risk of pneumothorax may be higher in certain types of 
tumours such as soft tissue sarcoma.  The presence of lung metastases and 
tumours with high therapeutic responses to lenvatinib may increase the risk of 
pneumothorax.

Potential Risk:  Overdose (concomitant everolimus) (RCC)
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
There is a potential for dosing errors as the dose of everolimus when used 
concomitantly with lenvatinib is lower than when everolimus is used alone in 
monotherapy.  In the RCC Lenvatinib + Everolimus Safety Set, everolimus 
overdose was recorded in 4 subjects (0.6%).  Two subjects in Study 307 had a 
planned dose of 0 mg and took 5 mg for 1 day.  At a planned dose of 5 mg, 
1 subject in Study 205 took 10 mg for 1 day and 1 subject in Study 307 took 
10 mg for 4 days.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Molecularly targeted drugs given in combination are usually administered at a 
dosage lower than that of their individual monotherapies so physicians and 
pharmacists prescribing or dispensing such drugs should be alert to this risk.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Bylvay is indicated for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients 
aged 6 months or older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the management of PFIC. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of odevixibat is 40 mcg/kg administered orally once daily in the morning. 
Odevixibat can be taken with or without food. 
Table 1 shows the strength and number of capsules that should be administered daily based on body 
weight to approximate a 40 mcg/kg/day dose.

Dose escalation 
Improvement in pruritus and reduction of serum bile acid levels may occur gradually in some patients 
after initiating odevixibat therapy. If an adequate clinical response has not been achieved after 
3 months of continuous therapy, the dose may be increased to 120 mcg/kg/day (see section 4.4.).  
Table 2 shows the strength and number of capsules that should be administered daily based on body 
weight to approximate a 120 mcg/kg/day dose, with a maximum daily dose of 7 200 mcg per day.

Missed doses 
If a dose of odevixibat is missed, the patient should take the forgotten dose as soon as possible without 
exceeding one dose per day. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
There are no available clinical data for the use of odevixibat patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 5.1 
and 5.2). 
No data are available for PFIC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). Additional 
monitoring for adverse reactions may be warranted in these patients when odevixibat is administered 
(see section 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of odevixibat in children aged less than 6 months has not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration  
Bylvay is for oral use. To be taken with or without food in the morning (see section 5.2).  
The larger 200 mcg and 600 mcg capsules are intended to be opened and sprinkled on food but may be 
swallowed whole. 
The smaller 400 mcg and 1 200 mcg capsules are intended to be swallowed whole but may be opened 
and sprinkled on food. 
If the capsule is to be swallowed whole, the patient should be instructed to take it with a glass of water 
in the morning. 
For capsules to be opened, the patient should be instructed to: 
• 
place a small quantity (30 mL/2 tablespoons) of soft food (yoghurt, apple sauce, oatmeal 
porridge, banana puree, carrot puree, chocolate-flavoured pudding or rice pudding) in a bowl. 
The food should be at or below room temperature. 
hold the capsule horizontally at both ends, twist in opposite directions and pull apart to empty 
the pellets into the bowl of soft food. The capsule should be gently tapped to ensure that all 
pellets will come out. 
repeat the previous step if the dose requires more than one capsule. 
gently mix the pellets with a spoon into the soft food. 
administer the entire dose immediately after mixing. Do not store the mixture for future use. 
drink a glass of water following the dose. 
dispose all empty capsule shells.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The mechanism of action of odevixibat requires that the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and bile 
salt transport into biliary canaliculi is preserved. Conditions, medications or surgical procedures that 
impair either gastrointestinal motility, or enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, including bile salt 
transport to biliary canaliculi have the potential to reduce the efficacy of odevixibat. For this reason, 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e.g. patients with PFIC2 who have a complete absence or lack of function of Bile Salt Export Pump 
(BSEP) protein (i.e. patients with BSEP3 subtype of PFIC2) will not respond to odevixibat. 
There are limited or no clinical data with odevixibat in PFIC subtypes other than 1 and 2. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied (see section 5.2). 
Periodic liver function tests should be considered for patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Diarrhoea has been reported as a common adverse reaction when taking odevixibat. Diarrhoea may 
lead to dehydration. Patients should be monitored regularly to ensure adequate hydration during 
episodes of diarrhoea (see section 4.8). 
In clinical trials, increased levels in liver function tests were observed in some patients receiving 
odevixibat. Assessment of liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) is recommended for all patients 
prior to initiating Bylvay, with monitoring per standard clinical practice.  
For patients with liver function test elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. 
Assessment of fat-soluble vitamin levels (Vitamins A, D, E) and international normalised ratio (INR) 
are recommended for all patients prior to initiating Bylvay, with monitoring per standard clinical 
practice. 
Treatment with odevixibat may impact the absorption of fat-soluble medicinal products (see 
section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Transporter-mediated interactions 
Odevixibat is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In adult healthy subjects, co-
administration of the strong P-gp inhibitor itraconazole increased the plasma exposure of a single dose 
of odevixibat 7 200 mcg by approximately 50-60%. This increase is not considered clinically relevant. 
No other potentially relevant transporter-mediated interactions were identified in vitro (see 
section 5.2). 
Cytochrome P450-mediated interactions 
In vitro, odevixibat did not induce CYP enzymes (see section 5.2). 
In in vitro studies, odevixibat was shown to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (see section 5.2).  
In adult healthy subjects, concomitant use of odevixibat decreased the area under the curve (AUC) of 
oral midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) by 30% and 1-OH-midazolam exposure by less than 20%, 
which is not considered clinically relevant.  
No interaction studies have been conducted with UDCA and rifampicin. 
In an interaction study with a lipophilic combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol 
(EE) (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (LVN) (0.15 mg) conducted in adult healthy females, concomitant 
use of odevixibat had no impact on the AUC of LVN and decreased the AUC of EE by 17%, which is 
not considered clinically relevant. Interaction studies with other lipophilic medicinal products have not 
been performed, therefore, an effect on the absorption of other fat-soluble medicinal products cannot 
be excluded. 
In clinical trials, decreased levels of fat-soluble vitamins were observed in some patients receiving 
odevixibat. Levels of fat-soluble vitamins should be monitored (see section 4.4). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
No interaction studies have been performed in paediatric patients. No differences are expected 
between the adult and paediatric populations. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception when treated with 
Bylvay. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of odevixibat in pregnant women. Animal studies have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Bylvay is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether odevixibat or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There is insufficient 
information on the excretion of odevixibat in animal milk (see section 5.3).  
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Bylvay therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the mother. 
Fertility 
No fertility data are available in humans. Animal studies do not indicate any direct or indirect effects 
on fertility or reproduction (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Bylvay has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reaction was diarrhoea reported in (7%) of patients.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table lists adverse reactions identified in clinical trials in patients with PFIC aged between 
4 months to 25 years of age (median 3 years 7 months). 
Adverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to 
< 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred at a frequency of 11% in patients treated with Bylvay. 
Adverse reactions of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and faeces soft were of short duration with most 
events ≤ 5 days in duration; median time to first onset was 16 days. All reports were mild to moderate 
in severity and non-serious. Two patients experienced an adverse reaction of clinically significant 
diarrhoea defined as diarrhoea that persisted for 21 or more days without any other aetiology, was 
severe in intensity, required hospitalisation or was considered an important medical event, or 
presented with concurrent dehydration requiring treatment with oral or intravenous rehydration and/or 
other treatment intervention (see section 4.4). Treatment interruption was reported for diarrhoea in 4% 
of patients and discontinuation of Bylvay due to diarrhoea was reported in 1%.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of the known pharmacodynamic 
effects of the medicinal product, mainly diarrhoea and gastrointestinal effects.  
The maximum dose administered to healthy subjects in clinical trials was odevixibat 10 000 mcg as a 
single dose, without any adverse consequences.  
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures 
instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Bile and liver therapy, other drugs for bile therapy, ATC code: A05AX05 
Mechanism of action 
Odevixibat is a reversible, potent, selective inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT).  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Odevixibat acts locally in the distal ileum to decrease the reuptake of bile acids and increase the 
clearance of bile acids through the colon, reducing the concentration of bile acids in the serum. The 
extent of reduction of serum bile acids does not correlate with systemic PK.

Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Bylvay in patients with PFIC was evaluated in two phase 3 trials. Trial 1 was a 
24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 62 patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis of PFIC Type 1 or Type 2. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, or 40 or 
120 mcg/kg/day odevixibat and stratified by PFIC Type (1 or 2) and age (6 months to 5 years, 6 to 
12 years, and 13 to ≤ 18 years). Patients with pathologic variations of the ABCB11 gene that predict 
complete absence of the BSEP protein and those with ALT > 10 × ULN or bilirubin > 10 × ULN were 
excluded. 13% of the patients had prior biliary diversion surgery. Patients completing Trial 1 were 
eligible to enrol in Trial 2, a 72-week open-label extension trial. The primary endpoint in Trial 1 was 
the proportion of patients with at least a 70% reduction in fasting serum bile acid levels or who 
achieved a level ≤ 70 µmol/L at week 24.  
The proportion of positive pruritus assessments at the patient level over the 24-week treatment period 
based on an observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) instrument was a secondary endpoint. A positive 
pruritus assessment was a score of ≤ 1 or at least 1-point improvement from baseline. Pruritus 
assessments were conducted in the morning and evening using a 5-point scale (0-4). Additional 
secondary endpoints included changes from baseline to end of treatment in growth, sleep parameters 
(per ObsRO) and ALT.  
Median (range) age of patients in Trial 1 was 3.2 (0.5 to 15.9) years; 50% were male and 84% were 
white. 27% of patients had PFIC Type 1 and 73% had PFIC Type 2. At baseline, 81% of patients were 
treated with UDCA, 66% with rifampicin, and 89% with UDCA and/or rifampicin. Baseline hepatic 
impairment per Child-Pugh classification was mild in 66% and moderate in 34% of patients. Baseline 
mean (SD) eGFR was 164 (30.6) mL/min/1.73 m². Baseline mean (SD) ALT, AST and bilirubin levels 
were 99 (116.8) U/L, 101 (69.8) U/L, and 3.2 (3.57) mg/dL, respectively. Baseline mean (SD) pruritus 
score (range: 0-4) and serum bile acids levels were similar in odevixibat-treated patients (2.9 [0.089] 
and 252.1 [103.0] µmol/L, respectively) and placebo-treated patients (3.0 [0.143] and 
247.5 [101.1] µmol/L, respectively).  
Table 4 presents the results of the comparison of the key efficacy results in Trial 1 between odevixibat 
and placebo. These data are displayed graphically over the 24-week treatment period in Figure 1 
(serum bile acids) and Figure 2 (scratching scores).

Weeks
In line with the results for reduction of pruritus (scratching), odevixibat reduced the percentage of days 
the patient required soothing, and patients less often required help falling asleep and had fewer days 
needing to sleep with a caregiver. Treatment with odevixibat also led to improvements from baseline 
in liver function test results (Table 5). The effect of odevixibat on growth parameters over 24 weeks is 
also presented.

Trial 2 is an interim cut of data from an ongoing 72-week open-label extension trial in PFIC patients 
treated with Bylvay 120 mcg/kg/day. The 79 patients (PFIC1 [22%], PFIC2 [51%], PFIC3 [5%] or 
PFIC6 [1%]) treated with 120 mcg/kg/day for up to 48 weeks experienced a durable effect on serum 
bile acids reduction, improvement in pruritus score, ALT, AST and total bilirubin. Across the 
79 patients, 45 had assessments on or after 48 weeks of treatment with odevixibat, including 13, 30, 1 
and 1 patients with PFIC1, PFIC2, PFIC3, and PFIC6, respectively; 9, 21, 4, and 0 patients, 
respectively, had not reached 48 weeks of treatment and were ongoing at the data cut-off. Overall, 
7 patients with PFIC2 had discontinued prior to 48 weeks of treatment with odevixibat. Improvements 
in z-scores for height and weight indicate an enhanced growth velocity and the potential for catch-up 
growth in actively growing children. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Bylvay in paediatric population less than 6 months; see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Exceptional circumstances 
This medicinal product has been authorised under ‘Exceptional Circumstances’. This means that due 
to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal 
product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become 
available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Odevixibat is minimally absorbed following oral administration; absolute bioavailability data in 
humans are not available, and estimated relative bioavailability is < 1%. Peak odevixibat plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is reached within 1 to 5 hours. Simulated Cmax values in a paediatric PFIC patient 
population for the 40 and 120 mcg/kg/day doses are 0.211 ng/mL and 0.623 ng/mL, respectively, and 
AUC values were 2.26 ng × h/mL and 5.99 ng × h/mL, respectively. There is minimal accumulation of 
odevixibat following once-daily dosing. 
Effect of food  
Systemic exposure of odevixibat does not predict efficacy. Therefore, no dose adjustment for food 
effects is considered necessary. Concomitant administration of a high-fat meal (800 - 1 000 calories 
with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) resulted in decreases of 
approximately 72% and 62% in Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively, compared to administration under 
fasted conditions. When odevixibat was sprinkled on apple sauce, decreases of approximately 39% 
and 36% in Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively, were observed compared to administration under fasted 
conditions. Taking into account the lack of PK/PD relationship and need for sprinkling the odevixibat 
capsule contents on food for younger children, odevixibat can be administered with food.  
Distribution 
Odevixibat is more than 99% bound to human plasma proteins. The mean body weight adjusted 
apparent volumes of distribution (V/F) in paediatric patients for the 40 and 120 mcg/kg/day dose 
regimens are 40.3 and 43.7 L/kg, respectively. 
Biotransformation 
Odevixibat is minimally metabolised in humans. 
Elimination 
Following administration of a single oral dose of 3 000 mcg of radiolabeled odevixibat in healthy 
adults, the average percent recovery of the administered dose was 82.9% in faeces; less than 0.002% 
was recovered in the urine. More than 97% of faecal radioactivity was determined to be unchanged 
odevixibat. 
The mean body weight normalised apparent total clearances CL/F in paediatric patients for the 40 and 
120 mcg/kg/day dose regimens are 26.4 and 23.0 L/kg/h, respectively, and the mean half-life is 
approximately 2.5 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The Cmax and AUC0-t increase with increasing doses in a dose-proportional manner; however due to the 
high interindividual variability of approximately 40%, it is not possible to estimate the dose 
proportionality accurately. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
Consistent with the mechanism and site of action of odevixibat in the gastrointestinal tract no 
relationship between systemic exposure and clinical effects is observed. Also, no dose-response 
relationship could be established for the investigated dose range 10-200 mcg/kg/day and the PD 
parameters C4 and FGF19. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of odevixibat were observed based on 
age, sex or race. 
Hepatic impairment 
The majority of patients with PFIC presented with some degree of hepatic impairment because of the 
disease. Hepatic metabolism of odevixibat is not a major component of the elimination of odevixibat. 
Analysis of data from a placebo-controlled study in patients with PFIC Types 1 and 2 did not 
demonstrate a clinically important impact of mildly impaired hepatic function (Child Pugh A) on the 
pharmacokinetics of odevixibat. Although, body weight adjusted CL/F values were lower and body 
weight adjusted V/F values were larger in paediatric patients with PFIC with Child Pugh B compared 
to healthy subjects, the safety profile was comparable between the patient groups. Patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied. 
Renal impairment 
There are no clinical data in patients with renal impairment, but the impact of renal impairment is 
expected to be small due to low systemic exposure and odevixibat is not excreted in urine. 
In vitro studies 
In in vitro studies, odevixibat did not inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6 at clinically 
relevant concentrations, but was shown to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  
Odevixibat does not inhibit the transporters P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic 
anion transporter (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporter (OCT2), 
multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE1 or MATE2-K). 
Odevixibat is not a BCRP substrate. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In pregnant New Zealand White rabbits, early delivery/abortion was observed in two rabbits receiving 
odevixibat during the period of foetal organogenesis at an exposure multiple of ≥ 2.3 of the anticipated 
clinical exposure (based on total plasma odevixibat AUC0-24). Reductions in maternal body weight and 
food consumption were noted in all dose groups (transient at the exposure multiple 1.1 of the 
anticipated dose).  
Starting from the exposure multiple of 1.1 of the clinical human exposure (based on total plasma 
odevixibat AUC0-24), 7 foetuses (1.3% of all foetuses from odevixibat exposed does) in all dose groups 
were found to have cardiovascular defects (i.e. ventricular diverticulum, small ventricle and dilated 
aortic arch). No such malformations were observed when odevixibat was administered to pregnant 
rats. Because of the findings in rabbits, an effect of odevixibat on cardiovascular development cannot 
be excluded.  
Odevixibat had no effect on the reproductive performance, fertility, embryo-foetal development, or 
prenatal/postnatal development studies in rats at the exposure multiple of 133 of the anticipated 
clinical exposure (based on total plasma odevixibat AUC0-24), including juveniles (exposure multiple 
of 63 of the anticipated human exposure). 
There is insufficient information on the excretion of odevixibat in animal milk.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The presence of odevixibat in breast milk was not measured in animal studies. Exposure was 
demonstrated in the pups of lactating dams in the pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study 
with rats (3.2-52.1% of the odevixibat plasma concentration of the lactating dams). It is therefore 
possible that odevixibat is present in breast milk.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Bylvay is and what it is used for 
Bylvay contains the active substance odevixibat. Odevixibat is a medicine which increases the 
removal of substances called bile acids from the body. Bile acids are components of the digestive fluid 
called bile, which is produced by the liver and secreted into the intestines. Odevixibat blocks the 
mechanism that normally reabsorbs them from the intestines after they have done their job. This 
allows them to pass out of the body in the stool. 
Bylvay is used to treat progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months 
or older. PFIC is a liver disease caused by build-up of bile acids (cholestasis) that gets worse over time 
and is often accompanied with severe itching. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Bylvay 
Do not take Bylvay 
• 
if you are allergic to odevixibat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Bylvay if you have: 
• 
• 
• 
been diagnosed with a complete absence or lack of function of bile salt export pump protein 
severely reduced liver function 
reduced stomach or bowel motility, or reduced circulation of bile acids between liver, bile and 
small intestine due to medicines, surgical procedures or diseases other than PFIC 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
since these may reduce the effect of odevixibat 
Talk to your doctor if you develop diarrhoea while taking Bylvay. Drinking sufficient liquid is 
recommended in patients with diarrhoea to prevent dehydration. 
Increased levels in liver function tests can occur in some patients receiving Bylvay. Assessment of 
liver function is recommended for all patients prior to Bylvay treatment. Your doctor may recommend 
more frequent monitoring if you have elevated liver function test results.  
Your doctor may recommend assessment of Vitamin A, D and E blood levels and the blood clotting 
value called INR prior to and during Bylvay treatment. 
Children 
Bylvay is not recommended for babies under 6 months because it is not known if the medicine is safe 
and effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Bylvay 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Treatment with odevixibat may affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A, D and 
E, and some medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Bylvay is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
It is not known if odevixibat can pass into breast milk and affect the baby. Your doctor will help you 
to decide whether to stop breast-feeding or avoid Bylvay treatment, considering the benefit of breast-
feeding to the baby and Bylvay to the mother. 
Driving and using machines 
Bylvay has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or capacity to use machinery. 
3. 
How to take Bylvay

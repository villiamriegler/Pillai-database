30 November 2017 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency after serious cases of liver injury 
associated with the use of Esmya were reported, 
including few cases which lead to liver 
transplantation. The PRAC was requested to assess 
the impact thereof on the benefit-risk balance of 
Esmya and to give its recommendation whether the 
marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data

Further to the results of PGL09-027 and PGL09-026 studies 
the SmPC based on two completed studies which 
II and PL 
(respectively PEARL III extension and PEARL III) the 
investigated the safety and efficacy of up to four 3-
month treatment courses of ulipristal acetate 10 mg. 
The limitation of a single 3-month treatment course 
has been removed and the prescription of a second 
3-month treatment course has been allowed. In 
addition, “alopecia” and “dry skin” have been 
included in the “uncommon” category of section 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated 
accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II 
and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.6.b - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Deletion of a therapeutic indication 
limitation of a single 3-month treatment course was 
removed and a second 3-month treatment course is 
allowed if deemed appropriate by the treating physician.  
This second 3-month treatment course should be separated 
from the first treatment course by a drug-free interval to 
allow return of menstruation and shedding of the 
endometrium. The treatment should not exceed two 
treatment courses of 3 months due to the lack of long term 
safety data. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC were updated to reflect the new data. The PL was 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, the key elements of the educational material 
were amended to reflect a) the revised posology: 5 mg 
tablet once daily for up to 3 months. This 3-month 
treatment course can be repeated once. Re-treatment 
should start at the earliest during the second menstruation 
following the first treatment course completion. Treatments 
should always be started during the first week of 
menstruation, and b) absence of safety data on the 
endometrium for continuous treatment longer than 3 
months

Based on the studies submitted by the MAH, section 4.4 of 
based on one clinical study conducted to assess 
potential drug-drug interactions with rifampicin, one 
pharmacokinetic study to assess the 
pharmacokinetics of ulipristal acetate in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment and two non-clinical 
carcinogenicity studies. The Package Leaflet was 
proposed to be updated accordingly. 
the SmPC was amended to state that the concomitant use 
of ulipristal acetate and potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, 
phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, St 
John´s wort, efavirenz, nevirapine, long term use of 
ritonavir) is not recommended.

Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 9.1 and to assign a new pharmaco-
therapeutic group for the medicinal product 
according to WHO.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC was amended to state that 
administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin 
(300 mg twice daily for 9 days) to healthy female 
volunteers markedly decreased Cmax and AUC of ulipristal 
acetate and its active metabolite by 90 % or more and 
decreased ulipristal acetate half-life by 2.2-fold 
corresponding to an approximately 10-fold decrease of 
ulipristal acetate exposure. Concomitant use of ulipristal 
acetate and potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, 
rifabutin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, 
fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, StJohn´s wort, 
efavirenz, nevirapine, long term use of ritonavir) is not 
recommended.  
Section 5.3 of the SmPC was amended to include 
information related to carcinogenicity studies (in rats and 
mice) showing that ulipristal acetate is not carcinogenic. 
Finally, the PI was brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 9.1 and a new pharmaco-therapeutic 
group was assigned for the medicinal product, according to 
WHO.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the studies submitted by the MAH, section 4.4 of 
the SmPC based on two clinical studies conducted to 
II and PL 
the SmPC was amended to state that co administration of 
assess potential drug-drug interactions with 
ketoconazole and fexofenadine, one pharmacokinetic 
study to assess excretion of ulipristal acetate in 
human breast milk and one open-label clinical study. 
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated 
accordingly.  
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 8.3 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
moderate (e.g. erythromycin, grapefruit juice, verapamil) 
or potent (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, nefazodone, 
itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin) CYP3A4 
inhibitors and ulipristal acetate is not recommended. 
Section 4.5  of the SmPC was amended to state that after 
administration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 
(400 mg once daily for 7 days) to healthy female 
volunteers, Cmax and AUC of ulipristal acetate increased 2 
and 5.9 fold, respectively; the AUC of the active metabolite 
of ulipristal acetate increased 2.4 fold while the Cmax of 
Esmya  
EMA/66019/2021 
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
the active metabolite decreased (0.53 fold change). 
In vitro data also indicate that  ulipristal acetate may be an 
inhibitor of P gp at clinically relevant concentrations in the 
gastrointestinal wall during absorption.  
Simultaneous administration of ulipristal acetate and a P gp 
substrate has not been studied and an interaction cannot 
be excluded. In vivo results show that ulipristal acetate 
(administered as a single 10 mg tablet) 1.5 hour before 
administration of the P gP substrate fexofenadine (60 mg) 
has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic of 
fexofenadine. It is therefore recommended that co-
administration of ulipristal acetate and P gp substrates 
(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, fexofenadine) should be 
separated in time by at least 1.5 hours. 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC was amended to include reference 
to the fact that the effect on newborn/infants has not been 
studied, whilst section 5.2 of the SmPC noted that  
ulipristal acetate and its active mono N demethylated 
metabolite are excreted in breast milk with a mean AUCt 
milk/plasma ratio of 0.74 ± 0.32 for ulipristal acetate. 
The list of adverse events was updated with the frequency 
of AEs, following the additional open-label phase III study 
conducted (Study PGL09-026). Finally, the PI was brought 
in line with the latest QRD template version 8.3.

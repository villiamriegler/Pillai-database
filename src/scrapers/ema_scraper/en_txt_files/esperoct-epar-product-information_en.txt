CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII activity levels is advised to 
guide adjustments of the dosing regimen of Esperoct, if needed. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and incremental recoveries. Dose based on 
bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, monitoring of the factor VIII substitution therapy by measurement 
of plasma factor VIII activity is necessary. 
The factor VIII activity of Esperoct can be measured using the conventional factor VIII assays, the 
chromogenic assay and the one-stage assay.  
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay.  
When using a one-stage clotting assay some silica based reagents should be avoided as they cause 
underestimation. Also there can be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-
based one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance 
particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. 
Posology 
The dose, dosing interval and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the 
factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding, on the targeted factor VIII activity 
level and the patient’s clinical condition. The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed 
in International Units (IU), which is related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products. The activity of factor VIII in plasma is expressed either as percentage (relative to normal 
human plasma level) or in International Units per dL (relative to the current International Standard for 
factor VIII in plasma). 
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of human plasma. 
On demand treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 
2 IU/dL. 
The required dose is determined using the following formula: 
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
Guidance for the dosing of Esperoct for the on-demand treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes 
is provided in table 1. Plasma factor VIII activity levels should be maintained at or above the 
described plasma levels (in IU per dL or % of normal). For treatment of bleeds a maximum single 
dose of Esperoct at 75 IU/kg and a maximum total dose of 200 IU/kg/24 hours may be administered.

Perioperative management 
The dose level and dosing intervals for surgery depend on the procedure and local practice. A 
maximum single dose of Esperoct at 75 IU/kg and a maximum total dose of 200 IU/kg/24 hours may 
be administered. 
The frequency of doses and duration of therapy should always be individually adjusted based on 
individual clinical response. 
Table 2 includes general recommendation for dosing of Esperoct for perioperative management. 
Consideration should be given to maintain a factor VIII activity at or above the target range.

Prophylaxis 
The recommended dose is 50 IU of Esperoct per kg body weight every 4 days. 
Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved factor VIII 
levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Paediatric population 
The dose in adolescents (12 years and above) is the same as for adults. 
In children below 12 years long-term safety has not been established (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Esperoct is for intravenous use. 
Esperoct should be administered by intravenous injection (over approximately 2 minutes) after 
reconstitution of the powder with 4 mL supplied solvent (sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection). 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

Known allergic reaction to hamster protein. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Hypersensitivity 
Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Esperoct. The product contains traces of 
hamster proteins, which in some patients may cause allergic reactions. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to immediately discontinue the use of the medicinal product and 
contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions 
including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII pro-coagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 
exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Decreased factor VIII activity in previously treated patients 
From post marketing reports, a decreased factor VIII activity in the absence of detectable factor VIII 
inhibitors has been reported in previously treated patients. The decreased factor VIII activity was 
observed at time of switching to Esperoct and may, in some cases, have been associated with anti-PEG 
antibodies. Appropriate determination of factor VIII activity upon switching should be considered. 
See section 4.8 for additional information. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase 
the cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, the risk of CVAD-related complications 
including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and adolescents (12-18 years). 
Excipient-related considerations 
The medicinal product contains 30.5 mg sodium per reconstituted vial, equivalent to 1.5% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2.0 g sodium for an adult.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) with other medicinal products have been 
reported. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation 
only if clearly indicated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Esperoct has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). 
Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has 
been observed. 
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with Esperoct. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as 
an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre is contacted. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequencies of adverse reactions as observed in 270 unique subjects across five prospective, 
multi-centre clinical studies in previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe haemophilia A (< 1% 
endogenous factor VIII activity) and no history of inhibitors are listed in table 3. The categories of 
adverse reactions presented in table 3 is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC 
and Preferred Term Level). 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very 
rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Factor VIII inhibitors 
One confirmed case of factor VIII inhibitor occurred in an 18 year-old previously treated patient on 
prophylactic treatment with Esperoct. The patient had a factor VIII gene intron 22 inversion and was 
at a high risk of developing factor VIII inhibitors.  
There is no indication of an increased risk of factor VIII inhibitor development with treatment of 
Esperoct as compared to other factor VIII products. 
Anti-drug antibodies 
There was one case of persistent anti-drug antibodies concomitant with the confirmed case of 
factor VIII inhibitors (see Factor VIII inhibitors). Three patients had transiently positive test results 
for anti-drug antibodies after administration of Esperoct but no correlation with adverse events could 
be established. 
Anti-PEG antibodies 
During the clinical trial programme, thirty-two patients had pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies before 
administration of Esperoct. Twenty of the 32 patients were negative for anti-PEG antibodies post 
administration of Esperoct. Eleven patients developed transient low titre anti-PEG antibodies. No 
correlation with adverse events could be established. 
From post-marketing reporting, occurrence of anti-PEG-antibodies has also been observed at time of 
switching to Esperoct. In some patients anti-PEG antibodies may have been associated with lower than 
expected level of FVIII activity. 
Paediatric population 
No difference in the safety profile was observed between previously treated adolescents (12-18 years) 
and adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02.  
Mechanism of action 
Turoctocog alfa pegol is a purified recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) product with a 40 kDa 
polyethylene-glycol (PEG) conjugated to the protein. The PEG is attached to the O-linked glycan in 
the truncated B-domain of rFVIII (turoctocog alfa). The mechanism of action of turoctocog alfa pegol 
is based on the replacement of the deficient or absent factor VIII in patients with haemophilia A. 
When turoctocog alfa pegol is activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the B-domain containing the 
PEG moiety and the a3-region are cleaved off, thus generating activated recombinant factor VIII 
(rFVIIIa) which is similar in structure to native factor VIIIa. 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When injected into a haemophiliac patient, 
factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. 
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin 
and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due 
to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By factor VIII replacement 
therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the 
factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Clinical efficacy during prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes 
The clinical efficacy of Esperoct for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds was investigated in five 
prospective, multi-centre clinical studies in 270 previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe 
haemophilia A. 
Prophylaxis in adults/adolescents 
The efficacy of Esperoct for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds was evaluated in an open-label, 
non-controlled trial in adolescents and adult patients with severe haemophilia A ages 12 years and 
above. The prophylactic effect of Esperoct was demonstrated with a dosing at 50 IU per kg body 
weight every 4 days or every 3–4 days (twice weekly) in 175 patients. The median annualized 
bleeding rate (ABR) in adults and adolescents receiving Esperoct was 1.18 (Interquartile range IQR: 
0.00;4.25), whereas the spontaneous ABR was 0.00 (IQR: 0.00;1.82), traumatic ABR was 0.00 (IQR: 
0.00;1.74) and joint ABR was 0.85 (IQR: 0.00;2.84). When including imputations, (replacing missing 
data for withdrawn patients with a substituted value) the estimated mean ABR for all bleeds was 
3.70 (95% CI: 2.94;4.66). Of the 175 adults/adolescents on prophylaxis, 70 (40%) did not have any 
bleeds. The mean annual consumption for prophylaxis was 4 641 IU/kg. 
Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and  
between different clinical studies. 
Adults/adolescents who had a low bleeding rate of 0-2 bleeding episodes during the last 6 months and 
had obtained at least 50 doses of Esperoct had the option of being randomised to prophylaxis treatment 
every 7 days (75 IU/kg every 7 days) or every 4 days (50 IU/kg every 4 days). A total of 55 of the 120 
eligible patients chose to be randomised (17 to the every 4 days dosing and 38 to the 75 IU every 
7 days). The ABR for randomised patients was 1.77 (0.59; 5.32) for treatment every 4 days and 3.57 
(2.13; 6.00) for once weekly prophylaxis. Nine of these patients reverted back to prophylaxis every 
4 days during the randomised study phase. Overall, including all extensions parts, 31 of 61 patients on 
every 7 days prophylaxis switched back to every 4 days treatment.

Prophylaxis in children (below 12 years) 
The use of Esperoct in children below 12 years is not indicated (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
The efficacy and safety of Esperoct for prophylaxis treatment of bleeds were evaluated in an 
open-label, single-arm, non-controlled trial in 68 children below 12 years with severe haemophilia A. 
The prophylactic effect of Esperoct was demonstrated with a dosing at 60 IU per kg body weight 
(50-75 IU/kg) twice weekly. The median and estimated mean annualized bleeding rate in children 
below 12 years receiving Esperoct twice weekly was 1.95 and 2.13 (95% CI: 1.48;3.06), whereas the 
spontaneous ABR was 0.00 and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.24;1.40), traumatic ABR was 0.00 and 1.52 (95% CI: 
1.07;2.17) and joint ABR was 0.00 and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.59;1.81), respectively. Of the 68 children 
below 12 years on prophylaxis, 29 (42.6%) did not have any bleeds. 
The mean annual consumption for prophylaxis was 6 475 IU/kg. 
Prophylaxis in previously untreated patients (PUPs) (below 6 years) 
The use of Esperoct in children below 12 years is not indicated (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
The efficacy and safety of Esperoct were evaluated in a multi-national, non-randomised, open label 
phase 3 trial. Pre-prophylaxis (optional on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes and/or dosing of 
60 IU/kg at intervals longer than a week until the subject reached 20 exposure days (EDs) or turned 24 
months of age) and prophylaxis treatment of bleeds were evaluated in 81 PUPs below 6 years with 
severe haemophilia A. Of the total 81 patients, 55 patients started on pre-prophylaxis and 42 of those 
patients then switched to prophylaxis. In total 69 patients received prophylaxis treatment with a dosing 
at 60 IU per kg body weight (50-75 IU/kg) twice weekly.  
The prophylactic effect of Esperoct in PUPs below 6 years with severe haemophilia A was 
demonstrated with a median and estimated mean annualized bleeding rate of 1.35 and 2.27 (95% CI: 
1.71;3.01).  
Of note, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies. 
The haemostatic response success rate for the 69 PUPs below 6 years on prophylaxis was 92.5% in 
treatment of bleeding episodes. 
The mean annual consumption for the 69 PUPs on prophylaxis was 5 395 IU/kg. 
In the trial, a total of 56 adverse reactions in 43 of 81 patients and a total of 80 serious adverse events 
in 48 patients were reported after exposure to Esperoct. 
In 31 out of 59 PUPs without inhibitors, transiently decreased factor VIII incremental recovery (IR) 
has been observed after exposure to Esperoct. There were 17 PUPs with consecutive measurements of 
decreased IR, all of these subjects had anti-PEG IgG antibodies. An association between anti-PEG 
antibodies and low IR cannot be excluded. 
Clinical efficacy of Esperoct in treatment of bleeding episodes and during on-demand treatment 
The efficacy of Esperoct in the treatment of bleeding episodes was demonstrated in all age groups. 
The vast majority of bleeds treated with Esperoct were of mild/moderate severity. 
The overall success rate for the treatment of bleeds was 87.7% and 94.4% of all bleeds treated with 
1-2 injections. 
In 12 patients above 18 years of age, 1 126 bleedings were treated among patients receiving 
on-demand treatment with an average treatment dose of 38.1 IU/kg with a mean annual consumption 
of 1 457 IU/kg. Of the total 1 126 bleeds, 86.9% were effectively treated with 1 injection and 96.8% 
were effectively treated with 1-2 injections of Esperoct.

Clinical efficacy of Esperoct during major surgery 
Esperoct was effective in maintaining haemostasis during major surgery with a success rate of 95.6% 
in all major surgeries performed (43 out of 45 had the effect rated as ‘excellent‘ or ‘good‘). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
In total, 129 single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of Esperoct were evaluated in 86 patients 
(including 24 paediatric patients of 0 to below 12 years). 
All pharmacokinetic studies with Esperoct were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
haemophilia A (factor VIII < 1%). Patients received a single dose of 50 IU/kg, and blood samples 
were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points up to 96 hours after dosing. 
The half-life of Esperoct was 1.6 fold longer compared to unmodified factor VIII products in adults. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters 
A total of 108 single dose pharmacokinetic profiles at 50 IU/kg Esperoct were evaluated in 
69 patients. The single dose pharmacokinetic parameters are comparable between young children (0 to 
below 6 years) and older children (6 to below 12 years), and between adolescents (12 to17 years) and 
adults (18 years and above). 
As expected incremental recovery appeared to be lower while body weight adjusted clearance 
appeared to be higher in children compared to adults and adolescents. In general, there was a trend of 
increasing incremental recovery and decreasing clearance (mL/h/kg) with age. This corresponds to a 
higher volume of distribution per kilo body weight in children compared to adults (table 4). 
The single dose pharmacokinetic parameters determined after 28 weeks of prophylactic treatment with 
Esperoct were consistent with the initial pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of Esperoct are listed in table 4. The use of Esperoct in 
children below 12 years is not indicated.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Esperoct is and what it is used for 
What Esperoct is 
Esperoct contains the active substance turoctocog alfa pegol and is a long-acting recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII product. Factor VIII is a protein found in the blood that helps to prevent and 
stop bleeding. 
What Esperoct is used for 
Esperoct is used to treat and prevent bleeding in people 12 years and above with haemophilia A 
(inborn factor VIII deficiency). 
In people with haemophilia A, factor VIII is missing or does not work properly. Esperoct replaces this 
faulty or missing factor VIII and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. 
2. 
What you need to know before you use Esperoct 
Do not use Esperoct 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6) 
if you are allergic to hamster proteins. 
• 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use Esperoct if either of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions  
Previous use of factor VIII medicine  
Tell your doctor if you have used factor VIII medicines before, especially if you developed inhibitors 
(antibodies) against the medicine, since there might be a risk that it happens again. 
Allergic reactions 
There is a risk that you may experience a severe and sudden allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic 
reaction) to Esperoct. 
Stop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have early signs of 
allergic reactions. These early signs may include rash, hives, weals, itching on large areas of skin, 
redness and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, wheezing, 
tightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, or dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting. 
Development of ‘factor VIII inhibitors’ (antibodies) 
Inhibitors (antibodies) can develop during the treatment with all factor VIII medicines 
These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working properly 
• 
You will be monitored carefully for development of these inhibitors 
• 
If your bleeding is not being controlled with Esperoct, tell your doctor immediately 
• 
Do not increase the total dose of Esperoct to control your bleed without talking to your doctor. 
• 
Catheter-related problems 
If you have a catheter where medicines can be injected into your blood (central venous access device), 
you may develop infections or blood clots at the site of the catheter. 
Heart disease 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease. 
Children 
Esperoct can not be used in children below 12 years of age. 
Other medicines and Esperoct 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Esperoct has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
Esperoct contains sodium 
This medicine contains 30.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per reconstituted vial. 
This is equivalent to 1.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Decreased factor VIII activity in previously treated patients 
A decreased factor VIII activity may occur in the beginning of your treatment. If you think your 
medicine works less than expected, tell your doctor. 
3. 
How to use Esperoct 
Treatment with Esperoct will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of people with 
haemophilia A. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure about how to use Esperoct. 
How Esperoct is given 
Esperoct is given as an injection into a vein (intravenously), see “Instructions on how to use Esperoct” 
for more information. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will calculate your dose for you. This will depend on your body weight and whether it is 
used to prevent or to treat a bleeding. 
To prevent bleeding 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above): The recommended dose is 50 IU of Esperoct per 
kg body weight every 4 days. Your doctor may choose another dose or how often the injections should 
be given, based on your need. 
To treat bleeding 
The dose of Esperoct is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. If you 
experience that the effect of Esperoct is insufficient, talk to your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Adolescents (12 years of age and above) can use the same dose as adults. 
If you use more Esperoct than you should 
If you use more Esperoct than you should, contact your doctor straight away. 
If you have to significantly increase your usage of Esperoct to stop a bleed, talk to your doctor 
immediately. For further information, see “Development of ‘factor VIII inhibitors’ (antibodies)” in 
section 2. 
If you forget to use Esperoct 
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not inject a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as scheduled and continue as advised by 
your doctor. If you are in doubt, contact your doctor. 
If you stop using Esperoct 
Do not stop using Esperoct without talking to your doctor. 
If you stop using Esperoct, you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not 
stop. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) 
Stop the injection immediately if you develop severe and sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic 
reactions). You must contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have signs of an 
allergic reaction such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
difficulty in swallowing or breathing 
wheezing 
chest tightness 
redness and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, face or hands 
rash, hives, weals or itching 
pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, or dizziness (low blood pressure) 
headache, nausea or vomiting. 
52

If you have previously received more than 150 days of treatment with factor VIII, inhibitors 
(antibodies) may develop (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). If this happens, your medicine may stop 
working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact 
your doctor immediately. See “Development of ‘factor VIII inhibitors’ (antibodies)” in section 2. 
The following side effects have been observed with Esperoct 
Very common side effects (may affect more than up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies) in patients not previously treated with factor VIII.

Instructions on how to use Esperoct 
Read these instructions carefully before using Esperoct. 
Esperoct is supplied as a powder. Before injection, it must be reconstituted with the solvent supplied 
in the syringe. The solvent is a sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. The 
reconstituted product must be injected into your vein (intravenous (IV) injection). The equipment in 
this package is designed to reconstitute and inject Esperoct. 
You will also need: 
• 
• 
• 
These items are not included in the Esperoct package. 
an infusion set (butterfly needle with tubing) 
sterile alcohol swabs 
gauze pads and plasters. 
Do not use the equipment without proper training from your doctor or nurse. 
Always wash your hands and ensure that the area around you is clean. 
When you prepare and inject medicine directly into a vein, it is important to use a clean and 
germ- free (aseptic) technique. An incorrect technique can introduce germs that can infect your 
blood. 
Do not open the equipment until you are ready to use it. 
Do not use the equipment if it has been dropped, or if it is damaged. Use a new package instead. 
Do not use the equipment if it has expired. Use a new package instead. The expiry date is printed 
on the outer carton, on the vial, on the vial adapter, and on the pre-filled syringe. 
Do not use the equipment if you suspect it is contaminated. Use a new package instead. 
Do not dispose of any of the items until after you have injected the reconstituted solution. 
The equipment is for single use only.

Place the vial on a flat and solid surface. 
  D 
Turn over the protective cap, and snap the vial 
adapter onto the vial. 
Once attached, do not remove the vial adapter 
from the vial. 
Lightly squeeze the protective cap with your 
thumb and index finger as shown. 
  E 
Remove the protective cap from the vial 
adapter. 
Do not lift the vial adapter from the vial when 
removing the protective cap. 
3. Attach the plunger rod and the syringe 
  F 
• 
• 
• 
Grasp the plunger rod by the wide top end and 
take it out of the carton. Do not touch the sides 
or the thread of the plunger rod. If you touch 
the sides or the thread, germs from your fingers 
can be transferred. 
Immediately connect the plunger rod to the 
syringe by turning it clockwise into the plunger 
inside the pre-filled syringe until resistance is felt. 
Remove the syringe cap from the pre-filled 
syringe by bending it down until the perforation 
breaks. 
  G 
Do not touch the syringe tip under the syringe 
cap. If you touch the syringe tip, germs from your 
fingers can be transferred. 
If the syringe cap is loose or missing, do not 
use the pre-filled syringe. 
• 
Screw the pre-filled syringe securely onto the 
vial adapter until resistance is felt.

4. Reconstitute the powder with the solvent 
  I 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hold the pre-filled syringe slightly tilted with 
the vial pointing downwards. 
Push the plunger rod to inject all the solvent 
into the vial. 
Keep the plunger rod pressed down and swirl 
the vial gently until all the powder is dissolved. 
  J 
Do not shake the vial as this will cause 
foaming. 
Check the reconstituted solution. It must be 
clear and colourless and no particles should be 
visible. If you notice particles or 
discolouration, do not use it. Use a new package 
instead. 
Esperoct is recommended to be used immediately after it has been reconstituted. 
If you cannot use the reconstituted Esperoct solution immediately (applies to 500 IU, 1 000 IU, 
1 500 IU, 2 000 IU, 3 000 IU), it should be used within: 
• 
• 
• 
24 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) or 
4 hours (≤ 30 °C) or 
1 hour between > 30 °C and 40 °C, only if the product was stored above room temperature 
(> 30 °C up to 40 °C) before reconstitution for no longer than 3 months. 
If you cannot use the reconstituted Esperoct solution immediately (applies to 4 000 IU, 
5 000 IU), it should be used within: 
• 
• 
24 hours when stored in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) or 
4 hours (≤ 30 °C). 
Store the reconstituted product in the vial. 
Do not freeze the reconstituted solution or store it in syringes. 
Keep the reconstituted solution out of direct light. 
If your dose requires more than one vial, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and 
pre-filled syringes until you have reached your required dose.

Keep the plunger rod pushed 
completely in. 
  K 
Turn the syringe with the vial upside 
down. 
Stop pushing the plunger rod and let it 
move back on its own while the 
reconstituted solution fills the syringe. 
Pull the plunger rod slightly 
downwards to draw the reconstituted 
solution into the syringe. 
If you do not need to use all of the 
reconstituted medicine from the vial, 
use the scale on the syringe to withdraw 
the dose you need, as instructed by your 
doctor or nurse. 
If, at any point, there is air in the syringe, 
inject the air back into the vial. 
While holding the vial upside down, tap 
the syringe gently to let any air bubbles 
rise to the top. 
Push the plunger rod slowly until all air 
bubbles are gone. 
Unscrew the vial adapter with the vial. 
  L 
Do not touch the syringe tip. If you 
touch the syringe tip, germs from your 
fingers can be transferred. 
5. Inject the reconstituted solution 
Esperoct is now ready to be injected into your vein. 
• 
• 
Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. 
Inject slowly over approximately 2 minutes. 
Do not mix Esperoct with any other intravenous injections or medicines. 
Injecting Esperoct via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters 
Caution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard 
luer-lock connections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the 
pre-filled syringe. This incompatibility may prevent administration of the medicine and result in 
damage to the needleless connector. 
Injecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter 
or a subcutaneous port: 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Use a clean and germ-free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your 
connector and CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. 
Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 mL plastic syringe for withdrawal of 
the reconstituted solution. This should be done right after step J. 
If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after the injection of Esperoct, use sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
Disposal 
  M 
• 
After injection, safely dispose of all 
unused Esperoct solution, the syringe with 
the infusion set, the vial with the vial 
adapter and other waste materials as 
instructed by your pharmacist. 
Do not throw it out with the ordinary 
household waste. 
Do not disassemble the equipment before disposal. 
Do not reuse the equipment.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling, PL 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Tremfya in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are 
issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) was obtained 
with the completion of the Phase 3 clinical study 
CNTO1959PSA3002; a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study of 
guselkumab in subjects with active PsA who had inadequate 
response to standard therapies (e.g., non-biologic DMARDs, 
apremilast, or NSAIDs). This submission focuses on efficacy 
and safety data from Week 52 to Week 112. Overall, clinical 
efficacy assessed across endpoints of signs and symptoms, 
physical function, and health related quality of life was 
maintained up to Week 100. The safety profile through Week 
100 was consistent with the known safety profile previously 
described for guselkumab, including the frequency of 
transaminases increase.

maintenance of clinical efficacy of guselkumab through 5 
years of treatment and were rather consistent between 
studies PSO3001 and PSO3002. Approximately 5% of 
patients who developed antidrug antibodies had neutralizing 
antibodies (0.76% of all treated patients), which was not 
associated with a reduction of clinical efficacy. 
The safety profile through 5 years was consistent with the 
known safety profile previously described for guselkumab.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Data from individual and pooled PSO3001 and PSO3002 
studies revealed that through 1 year, the frequency of 
transaminase increases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) for the guselkumab q8w 
dose was similar to that observed for the guselkumab q8w 
dose in the psoriatic arthritis clinical studies. Through 5 
years, the incidence of transaminase elevation did not 
increase by year of guselkumab treatment. Most 
transaminase increases were ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal. In 
most cases, the increase in transaminases was transient and 
did not lead to the discontinuation of treatment.

guselkumab transmission by lactation exposure can be 
considered theoretically very low. Although no specific data 
on investigation of concentration of guselkumab in breast 
milk is available, based on this analysis, it justified to  
remove the safety concern “exposure during lactation” as 
missing information in the RMP.  
The section 4.6 of the SmPC is also updated to reflect current 
scientific knowledge as follows. It is unknown whether 
guselkumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are 
known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days 
after birth, and decrease to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant 
during this period cannot be excluded. A decision should be 
made whether to discontinue, or abstain from initiating 
treatment with Tremfya, taking into account the benefit of

receive guselkumab (N=534; 100 mg at Week 0, 4 and q8w 
thereafter), or secukinumab (N=514; 300 mg at Week 0, 1, 
2, 3, 4, and q4w thereafter). The last dose was at week 44 for 
both treatment groups. Baseline disease characteristics were 
consistent with a population of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis with a median BSA of 20%, a median PASI score of 
18, and an IGA score of severe for 24% of patients. 
Results showed that guselkumab was superior to 
secukinumab as measured by the primary endpoint of PASI 
90 response at Week 48 (84.5% versus 70.0%, p < 0.001). 
Comparative PASI response rates are presented in tabulated 
format in the SmPC. 
The overall incidence of antibodies to guselkumab is 
consistent with the incidence rates reported in the pivotal 
guselkumab Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. The 
development of antibodies to guselkumab did not affect 
clinical responses. None of the subjects who were positive for 
antibodies to guselkumab had ISRs after developing the 
antibodies to guselkumab. 
The results of the PSO3009 study support the conclusion that 
guselkumab is well tolerated at the approved dose regimen 
of 100 mg, administered SC at Weeks 0, 4, and then q8w, in 
adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The 
available data from this study are consistent with the safety 
profile of guselkumab established to date, and no new safety

to three years data from the 2 Phase-3 studies PSO3001 and 
PSO3002 submitted for registration. These studies PSO3001 
and PSO3002 are currently ongoing and are in the open-label 
treatment phase which started at Week 52 in study PSO3001 
and Week 76 in study PSO3002. The data submitted focuses 
on longer-term efficacy and safety through 3 years (156 
weeks) of guselkumab treatment in moderate to severe 
psoriasis subjects (PSO3001 and PSO3002) as well as 
retreatment data among those subjects who reinitiated 
therapy after withdrawal (PSO3002).  
In PSO3001, for patients receiving continuous guselkumab 
treatment, the PASI 90 response rate was maintained from 
Week 52 through Week 156. For patients randomised to 
adalimumab at Week 0 who crossed over to guselkumab at 
Week 52, the PASI 90 response rate increased from Week 52 
through Week 76 and was then maintained through Week 
156. In PSO3002, among 112 patients randomised to 
adalimumab who failed to achieve a PASI 90 response at 
Week 28, 66% and 76% achieved a PASI 90 response after 
20 and 44 weeks of treatment with guselkumab, 
respectively. In addition, among 95 patients randomised to 
guselkumab who failed to achieve a PASI 90 response at 
Week 28, 36% and 41% achieved a PASI 90 response with 
an additional 20 and 44 weeks of continued treatment with 
guselkumab, respectively. Among patients who were 
withdrawn from treatment and subsequently re-initiated 
guselkumab, 80% regained a PASI 90 response when 
assessed 20 weeks after initiation of retreatment. 
The safety analyses presented showed that guselkumab is 
Page 8/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
well tolerated through 3 years of treatment, and the safety 
profile remains consistent when compared to Week 48 data, 
at the approved dose regimen of 100 mg, administered SC at 
Weeks 0, 4, and then q8w. No new adverse events were 
identified. Based on the results of the studies updates were 
made to the SmPC section “Selected to the description of 
selected adverse reactions” for gastroenteritis, injection site 
reactions and Immunogenicity. Through Week 156, 4.9% of 
all Tremfya-treated patients reported gastroenteritis. 
Adverse reactions of gastroenteritis were non serious and did 
not lead to discontinuation of Tremfya through Week 156. 
Through Week 156, 0.5% of Tremfya injections were 
associated with injection site reactions. Adverse reactions of 
injection site erythema and injection site pain were generally 
mild to moderate in severity; none were serious, and none 
led to discontinuation of Tremfya. 
In the pooled phase III analyses, approximately 9% of 
patients treated with Tremfya developed antidrug antibodies 
in up to 156 weeks of treatment. Antidrug antibodies were 
not associated with lower efficacy or development of 
injection site reactions.

On 27 February 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Entyvio. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Takeda Pharma A/S. 
The CHMP recommended the addition of a new pharmaceutical form: a 108mg solution for injection to be 
given subcutaneously. The new formulation is to be used as maintenance treatment for all the authorised 
indications of Entyvio: 
“Ulcerative colitis 
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant 
to either conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist. 
Crohn’s disease 
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

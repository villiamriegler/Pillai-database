SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
Introduction 
The active substance of Alimta is pemetrexed, an antifolate that exerts its antineoplastic activity by 
disrupting the folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.  
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT), which are crucial for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine 
nucleotides. Polyglutamated metabolites of pemetrexed and their prolonged intracellular half-life are 
resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
Alimta was granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) in the European Union (EU) on 20 September 
2004. Alimta is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. Alimta is also indicated in combination 
with cisplatin for the first line treatment, and as monotherapy for the second line treatment, of patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous 
cell histology. 
Lung cancer 
Over one million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year worldwide, resulting in close to 
one  million  deaths.  It  is  the  second  most  common  cancer  in  men  as  well  as  women,  accounting  for 
about  13%  of  cancer  diagnoses,  but  it  is  the  leading  cause  of  cancer-related  deaths  in  industrialized 
countries. It is one of the few that continues to show an increasing incidence. Prognosis is poor with 
relative  1-year  survival  rates  of  approximately  30%  and  5-year  survival  rates  around  10%.  134.171 
men and 29.948 women died of lung cancer in the European Union in 1985. Although the standardised 
mortality ratio is declining slightly in men it is still rising in women in the vast majority of European 
Countries. 
Lung  cancer  is  subdivided  in  two  groups:  small  cell  lung  cancer  (SCLC)  and  non  small  cell  lung 
cancer (NSCLC). SCLC is recognized by its chemo- and radiosensitivity. NSCLC is a heterogenous 
group of tumours with common treatment and prognosis. 
NSCLC represents about 80% of all lung cancer cases. The most common histologies are epidermoid 
or squamous cell carcinoma (~40% of cases), adenocarcinoma (~35% of cases), and large cell 
carcinoma (~25% of cases). The frequency of these different histological subsets varies across 
countries and over time, with a decrease in squamous cell histology in industrialised countries.  
Surgery is the preferred treatment of patients with early disease. However, more than 60-65% of 
patients present with a locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic disease (stage IV) and are not 
suitable for surgery. Current standard of care of patients presenting with locally advanced or 
metastasising NSCLC is systemic chemotherapy with platinum based doublets. Typically, these 
platinum based doublets are administered for 4 to 6 cycles (provided that progression of disease does 
not occur). For patients with a disease staged as IIIB or IV the primary goal of therapy is palliative 
treatment. Only moderate gains in survival and other outcomes like time to disease progression and 
quality of life have been shown with platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Bevacizumab  was  approved  as  first-line  therapy  for  advanced  NSCLC  based  on  improvement  in 
overall survival (OS) when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) when combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine, as compared to the platinum doublet 
alone.  Bevacizumab  was  administered  in  combination  with  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  for  up  to  6 
cycles, followed by single-agent bevacizumab until disease progression.  
A  second  3-arm  study  evaluated  2  doses  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  gemcitabine  and 
cisplatin  for  up  to  6  cycles,  followed  by  single-agent  bevacizumab  until  disease  progression. 
Bevacizumab therapy is limited to patients with non-squamous NSCLC histology.

Alimta  in  combination  with  cisplatin  has  also  recently  been  approved  for  the  first-line  treatment  of 
patients with advanced NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology. This approval was 
based on results from Study JMDB, a phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin (AC) compared to 
gemcitabine  plus  cisplatin  (GC).  The  primary  objective  of  Study  JMDB  was  the  comparison  of  OS 
time  between  patients  treated  with  AC  versus  GC  as  first-line  treatment  for  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic NSCLC. Patients were treated for a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy. 
Once first line treatment with platinum doublets has been completed, there are currently only second 
line treatment options available in patients progressing. Licensed second line treatments include 
docetaxel monotherapy, and Alimta monotherapy (limited to non-squamous NSCLC histologies). 
The concept of maintenance treatment in NSCLC has been investigated in the past without convincing 
results. However, maintenance therapy studies of single-agent docetaxel, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine 
have suggested benefit of single-agent treatment with improved OS, time to disease progression (TtP), 
PFS, or response rate (RR) following first-line (induction) therapy. 
Scope of the variation 
This type II variation concerns an extension of indication to include monotherapy maintenance 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Sections 4.1, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Further, the MAH has updated annex IIB to include the version number of the latest Risk Management 
Plan (version 2.1) agreed with the CHMP.   
For this new indication, the proposed posology is the one already authorised for Alimta as 
monotherapy in the 2nd line treatment of NSCLC. In patients treated for NSCLC after prior 
chemotherapy, the recommended dose of Alimta is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. 
The  new  NSCLC  maintenance  treatment  indication  is  supported  by  one  pivotal,  multicentre, 
randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study (JMEN), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of  
maintenance treatment with Alimta plus best supportive care (BSC) (n=441) with that of placebo plus 
BSC (n=222) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC who did 
not progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing Cisplatin or Carboplatin in 
combination with Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, or Docetaxel. First line doublet therapy containing 
ALIMTA was not included because the results of the first-line study with Alimta-cisplatin were not 
yet available. 
Clinical aspects 
GCP compliance 
All clinical studies included in the dossier have been conducted in compliance with the principles of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Clinical pharmacology 
No new data concerning clinical pharmacology have been submitted in support of the present 
application, which is acceptable. 
The clinical pharmacology of pemetrexed has been well characterized as part of the initial marketing 
authorisation application for MPM and for previously treated NSCLC. Given the extensive 
information available regarding the clinical pharmacology of pemetrexed, both administered as a 
single agent and in combination with cisplatin, no further pharmacokinetic information was collected 
in the Phase III Study JMEN. Clinical pharmacology for the maintenance indication is not expected to 
be different from other approved indications for pemetrexed (e.g., second-line treatment with single-
agent pemetrexed).

Clinical Efficacy 
As  mentioned  above,  the  new  requested  indication  is  mainly  supported  by  one  pivotal,  multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study (JMEN). 
Pivotal clinical Phase III study - JMEN 
Methods 
The primary objective of study JMEN was to compare maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus best 
standard care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC, in terms of objective PFS in patients with Stage IIIB 
(with pleural effusion and/or positive supraclavicular lymph nodes) or Stage IV NSCLC who had not 
progressed during 4 cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy.  
Secondary objectives of the study were to compare (i) overall survival (OS) time, (ii) additional time-
to-event  efficacy  endpoints  (time  to  objective  progressive  disease  (TtP),  time  to  worsening  of 
symptoms  (TWS),  (iii)  objective  tumor  response  rate,  (iv)  adverse  events  and  finally  (v)  changes  in 
individual symptom scores and quality of life using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) between 
the randomized study arms. 
An additional secondary objective was the consideration of efficacy with respect to histologic types, 
including an assessment of treatment-by-histology interaction. 
Study Design 
Study  JMEN  was  a  global,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study. 
Approximately 660 patients were planned to be enrolled. Subjects were randomized (in a 2:1 ratio) to 
the experimental study arm (pemetrexed plus BSC) or the control arm (placebo plus BSC) following 
induction  therapy.  Patients  were  required  to  be  chemo  naive  prior  to  induction  chemotherapy.  
According to the protocol, patients in both study arms were required to receive folic acid and vitamin 
B12 supplementation and dexamethasone. 
A minimization principle was adopted to balance patient assignment between study arms, using a 
probability factor of 0.75, based on the following factors: 
  disease stage prior to administration of induction therapy (IIIB versus IV) 
  ECOG performance status just prior to randomization (0 versus 1) 
  best tumor response to induction chemotherapy (CR/PR versus SD) 
  gender (male versus female) 
  previously treated brain metastases (yes versus no) 
  non-platinum component of induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine versus paclitaxel versus 
docetaxel). 
Each patient underwent a treatment period and a follow-up period.  The treatment period consisted of 
treatment  cycles,  each  21  days  long.  Patients  received  treatment  (experimental  or  control)  until 
objective  disease  progression.  The  follow-up  period  began  when  the  patient  discontinued  study 
treatment; follow-up included periodic tumor response evaluation until objective disease progression.  
Investigators  followed  all  patients  until  death  or  study  closure.  Maintenance  treatment  had  to  begin 
≥ 21 and ≤ 42 days from the last dose of induction therapy.

Treatment regimen 
Patients were randomly assigned (within 42 days of Cycle 4 [Day 1] induction therapy) to 1 of 2 study 
therapies. 
Experimental (Pemetrexed) Arm: pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days, plus BSC. 
Control (Placebo) Arm: normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) on Day 1 every 21 days, plus BSC. 
Patients  were  allowed  to  receive  full  supportive-care  therapies  concomitantly  during  the  study.  No 
other  anticancer  therapy,  immunotherapy,  hormonal  cancer  therapy,  radiation, surgery  for  cancer,  or 
experimental medications was permitted while patients were participating in Study JMEN, including 
patients  who  the  study  had  randomized  to  receive  placebo  plus  BSC.  Any  disease  progression 
requiring  other  forms  of  systemic  ant  tumor  therapy  were  cause  for  early  discontinuation  of  study 
therapy. 
CSFs:  The  protocol  did  not  permit  the  routine  use  of  colony-stimulating  factors  (CSFs)  during 
treatment. Physicians used G-CSF only for patients who had ANC < 0.5 ´ 109/L, neutropenic fever, or 
documented infections while neutropenic. 
NSAIDs:  Patients  taking  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  or  salicylates  were  not 
allowed the NSAID or salicylate 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days after receiving study therapy.  If 
a patient was taking an NSAID or salicylate with a long half-life (for example, naproxen, piroxicam, 
diflunisal,  or  nabumetone),  it  was  not  permitted  5  days  before,  the  day  of,  or  2  days  after  receiving 
study therapy. 
Leucovorin Rescue: Leucovorin was allowed in order to treat Grade 4 myelosuppression lasting more 
than  3  days,  including  CTCAE  Grade  4  leukopenia  and  CTCAE  Grade  4  neutropenia.    In  addition, 
leucovorin  could  be  used  immediately  for  CTCAE  Grade  4  thrombocytopenia,  bleeding  associated 
with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 or 4 mucositis. 
Diarrhea: the following supportive measures were allowed: hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.  
If  diarrhea  was  severe  (requiring  intravenous  rehydration)  and/or  associated  with  fever  or  severe 
(CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed.  Patients with severe 
diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting were hospitalized for intravenous 
hydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances. 
Febrile  Neutropenia:  Physicians  managed  patients  who  had  febrile  neutropenia,  especially  when 
accompanied  by  diarrhea,  in  a  hospital  setting  according  to  standard  procedures,  with  the  urgent 
initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy. 
Efficacy and Safety variables 
Objective Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary efficacy variable in this study. 
Objective PFS was measured from the date of randomization (after completion of induction 
chemotherapy) to the first date of objective progression of disease or of death from any cause. For 
each patient who was not known to have died or to have had objective progression of disease as of the 
data-inclusion cut-off date for the analysis, PFS was censored at the date of the patient’s last tumour 
assessment prior to that cut-off date.

Overall survival time (OS) is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any 
cause. For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for the 
analysis, OS was to be censored at the date of last prior contact. 
Time to objective progressive disease (TPD) is measured from the date of randomization to the first 
date of objective progression of disease. For each patient who is not known to have had an objective 
progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for the analysis, or who has died without 
objective progressive disease, TPD will be censored for that analysis at the date of the patient’s last 
tumour assessment prior to that cut-off date. Please note that TPD, else than PFS, does not include 
death as an event. 
Time to worsening of symptoms (TWS) was measured from the date of randomization to the first date 
of a worsening in any one of the 6 Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) symptoms (as defined by a 
15-mm increase from baseline in the patient-reported score for any symptom). 
Tumour response was assessed using RECIST criteria.  
Adverse events were rated using the NCI CTCAE scale. 
Statistical Methods 
The study was designed to randomize approximately 660 patients at a 2:1 ratio between 2 maintenance 
study arms: (a) pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus BSC administered until disease progression 
(approximately 440 patients), or (b) a treatment option utilizing placebo plus BSC until disease 
progression (approximately 220 patients).  
The Sponsor originally selected this sample size to provide a final analysis of OS with 80% power 
using a one-sided alpha level of 0.025, assuming 475 events and an OS HR of 0.767. The implemented 
protocol amendment (a) changed the primary endpoint of this trial to PFS while maintaining nearly 
identical statistical assumptions and error control of the originally planned final analysis of OS. 
All study outcomes were analyzed at the time of PFS analysis (after a minimum of 462 PFS events).  
According to the protocol, in order to maintain an overall one-sided alpha error probability of 0.025 
(for the PFS and OS analyses), the study applied the following statistical gate keeping and alpha-
spending scheme: 
(i) the primary statistical test of PFS was performed using a nominal one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
(ii) a one-sided alpha level of 0.025 was split between the preliminary and final analyses of OS: a 
nominal one-sided level of 0.00001 was spent for the preliminary analysis of OS, leaving a nominal 
level of 0.02499 to be spent for the final analysis of OS. 
The primary analysis assumed the PFS HR as approximately constant during the period of follow-up 
after randomization and estimated the PFS HR from the study data using a Cox proportional hazards 
model with assigned treatment as the only covariate. From this Cox model, a two-tailed 95% 
confidence interval was used to assess the following statistical hypotheses:  
H0:  PFS HR ≥ 1.00 (null hypothesis) 
HA:  PFS HR < 1.00 (alternative, research hypothesis) 
• 
• 
If the 95% confidence interval for the PFS HR was found to fall entirely below the margin of 1.00, the 
null hypothesis H0 would be rejected at a nominal one-sided 0.025 significance level.  
Assuming the primary analysis included at least 462 PFS events, and assuming the true value of the 
PFS HR would be 0.75, there was an 85% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis H0.  
The final analysis of OS would include a minimum of 475 OS events (projected to occur 
approximately 1 year after the primary analysis). A one-sided test of hypotheses was planned to be 
performed at a nominal 0.02499 level (using hypotheses analogous to those described above for PFS).  
Assuming the true value of the OS HR is 0.767, there is approximately an 80% probability of a 
Page 7 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
statistically significant test. Therefore, this amended analysis plan was supposed to preserve the 
original protocol-designed statistical power for assessing OS.  
Covariate-adjusted analyses of time-to-event variables were performed using the Cox proportional 
hazards model stratified by the non-platinum component of the induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine 
versus taxanes). The following covariates were considered for inclusion in the adjusted models: 
-Assigned study treatment (pemetrexed plus BSC over placebo plus BSC) 
-ECOG performance status just prior to randomization (0 over 1) 
-Platinum component of induction therapy (cisplatin over carboplatin) 
-Best tumor response to induction chemotherapy (CR/PR over SD) 
-Ethnic origin (Southeast Asian over other) 
-Smoking status (never smoker over ever smoker) 
-Gender (female over male) 
-Age group prior to randomization (< 65 over > 65) 
-Disease stage prior to administration of induction therapy (IIIB over IV) 
-Previously treated brain metastases (no over yes) 
-Squamous histology (no over yes)

Randomization factors 
This study enrolled patients who were initially treated with 4 cycles of 1 of 6 prespecified induction 
therapy regimens, but only if patients had not progressed following induction treatment.  
Randomization factors included the non-platinum component of induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine 
versus paclitaxel versus docetaxel), as well as best response to induction therapy (CR/PR versus SD), 
disease stage prior to induction therapy, ECOG performance status at the time of randomization, 
gender, and previously treated brain metastases.

Concomitant medications 
As regards the baseline (and on treatment) factor concomitant medications there was a higher rate of 
erythropoietic growth factors received by patients in the pemetrexed compared to the placebo arm. No 
differences were observed in other classes of medications used in this patient population.

Discontinuation 
The study design allowed to receive treatment (experimental or control) until objective disease 
progression; accordingly, PD was the most common reason for study discontinuation in both study 
arms. A higher percentage of patients in the placebo arm discontinued due to PD or death compared to 
the pemetrexed arm, while a higher percentage of patients in the pemetrexed arm discontinued due to 
subject decision, AE, or physician decision 
Protocol violation 
A total of 217 randomized patients (32.7%) were reported to have at least 1 protocol violation. The 
most commonly identified protocol violations for the randomized patient population were for 
prolonged intervals between lesion assessments (13.1%); each of the remaining violations occurred at 
a rate less than 10%. In general, protocol violations in this study were balanced between study arms 
such that they were not likely to have affected the analyses or conclusions presented in this report. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
Objective Progression-Free Survival (PFS) following induction chemotherapy 
The PFS analysis of the study was measured from the date of randomisation, which occurred after 
completion of induction therapy, to the date of progression or death from any cause. A total of 504 
PFS events had occurred at the time of database lock; 123 patients (27.9%) in the pemetrexed arm and 
36 patients (16.2%) in the placebo arm were censored for the PFS analysis. Median PFS was 4.27 
months in the pemetrexed arm and 2.60 months in the placebo arm, and the primary statistical 
comparison between arms was statistically significant (HR = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]:  0.42 
to 0.61; p < 0.00001).

A covariate-adjusted analysis of PFS was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The 
treatment effect (HR = 0.52; 95% CI:  0.43 to 0.62; p < 0.0001) was similar to that observed in the 
primary unadjusted analysis. None of the cofactors had a statistically significant effect on PFS (all

Progression-Free Survival Measured from Start of Induction Treatment: The primary PFS analysis of 
the study was measured from the date of randomization, which occurred after completion of induction 
therapy. An additional analysis of PFS was calculated from the date of the first dose of induction 
chemotherapy to the first date of objective progression of disease or of death from any cause.  It was 
expected that this analysis would add approximately 3 months to the median times observed in the 
primary analysis.  Evaluating from the start of induction therapy did not change the HR or the p-value 
compared to the primary analysis. Median PFS measured from the start of induction treatment was 
7.72 months in the pemetrexed arm and 5.91 months in the placebo arm. 
Independently Reviewed Progression-Free Survival: To further evaluate the robustness of PFS, the 
Sponsor established an independent review of PFS to assess the potential for investigator bias in the 
determination of progressive disease between study arms. Of the 663 randomized patients with 
investigator assessments of PFS, reviewable scans were available for independent review for 581 
patients (87.6%). Independently assessed median PFS following induction therapy was 4.04 months in 
the pemetrexed arm and 1.97 months in the placebo arm, with the unadjusted HR estimated to be 0.60 
(95% CI:  0.49 to 0.73). This analysis demonstrated that results of investigator-assessed PFS were 
consistent with those of the independently reviewed assessments in terms of the relative efficacy of the 
2 arms. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis with 
respect to the definition of censoring and the timing of radiologic assessments. The first sensitivity 
analysis (SA1) defined PFS as in the primary analysis, but with additional censoring at the date a 
patient initiated postdiscontinuation anticancer therapy.  A total of 13 additional patients were 
censored compared to the primary analysis.  The results of SA1 are nearly identical to results from the 
primary PFS analysis. 
The other 2 sensitivity analyses (SA2 and SA3) adjusted the definition of PFS dependent on the timing 
of the first radiologic assessment with PD. According to the Study Schedule, radiologic assessments 
were conducted after every 2 cycles of therapy (approximately every 42 days).  Compared to the 
Page 12 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo arm, a greater number of patients in the pemetrexed arm experienced dose delays which may 
have led to delayed radiologic assessments. Thus, SA2 and SA3 were conducted to assess whether 
there was any bias affecting the analysis caused by delayed assessments in the pemetrexed arm. 
For patients who had PD occurring more than 49 days after the previous radiologic assessment, SA2 
moved the date of the PD back to the date when the radiologic assessment would have occurred if 
there had been no delay (that is, 42 days after the previous assessment).  While median PFS times 
under this definition were slightly shorter on both arms compared to those under the primary analysis, 
the estimated hazard ratio was very similar to the primary analysis. 
For those patients who had PD occurring more than 49 days after the previous radiologic assessment, 
SA3 censored the PFS times of these patients back to the date of the earlier assessment.  The results 
are very similar to the findings in the primary analysis. 
These sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the primary analysis; they strongly indicate that 
postdiscontinuation therapy and delayed radiologic assessments did not bias the primary analysis in 
favor of pemetrexed.

Progression-Free Survival within Key Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses were performed to assess whether the PFS results within certain key subgroups 
were consistent with survival results for the overall study, or whether there is evidence of differential 
treatment benefit in certain subgroups. Subgroups were analyzed separately as defined by the 
following factors: NSCLC histology, age, gender, origin, smoking status, ECOG performance status, 
induction platinum, and induction response. Several of these factors are commonly found to be 
prognostic of OS in advanced NSCLC.  
Additional rationale for certain subgroup analyses are described further below: 
- The choice of ever-smoker versus never-smoker is based on erlotinib data showing that erlotinib was 
more effective in patients who had never been smokers than in current or former smokers. In addition, 
smoking status may be associated with histologic cell type and other patient comorbidities, which may 
impact patient prognosis.  In Study JMDB, smoking status was identified as a significant prognostic 
factor for first-line NSCLC patients. 
- Safety and efficacy analyses by age and origin (as well as gender, included as a randomization 
factor) are regulatory requirements; the categories for origin were divided into 3 groups based on a 
blinded review of Study JMEN baseline data, permitting adequately sized categories for meaningful 
comparisons. 
Page 13 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Histologic categories of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma are the 
most common NSCLC cell types. The prospective decision to perform histologic subgroup analyses in 
Study JMEN was based on results of the pivotal Phase 3 Study JMDB, and on a retrospective analysis 
of the Phase 3 study of pemetrexed in previously treated NSCLC (Study JMEI), which suggested a 
possible correlation between histology and efficacy. 
The subgroup analyses showed that PFS was significantly superior in the pemetrexed arm for the 
subcategories of age (< 65,  65) and gender.  The majority of patients were either Caucasian or East 
Asian (87.8% of patients); the PFS for these patients was similar to the overall population, with a 
significant increase in PFS in the pemetrexed arm.

Final Overall Survival (OS) results – Overall Population 
The  OS  analysis  of  the  study  was  measured  from  the  date  of  randomisation,  which  occurred  after 
completion  of  induction  therapy,  to  the  date  of  death  from  any  cause.  Table  3.1  presents  summary 
statistics  of  OS  for  all  randomised  patients.  The  OS  results  indicated  a  statistically  significant 
improvement of OS for the pemetrexed arm in the overall study population, with a hazard ratio of 0.79 
(95%  CI:  0.65  to  0.95;  p  =  0.01192),  representing  a  21%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  for  patients 
receiving  pemetrexed.  Median  OS  was  13.4  months  for  patients  receiving  pemetrexed  and  10.6 
months  for  patients  receiving  placebo.  The  1-year  survival  rate  in  the  randomised  population  was 
estimated at 55% for the pemetrexed arm and 43% for the placebo arm.

A total of 387 patients (87.8%) in the pemetrexed arm and 194 patients (87.4%) in the placebo arm 
had sufficient assessment data from which to determine a best response of CR, PR, SD, or PD.  The

demonstrated that results of investigator-assessed RR and disease control rate were consistent with 
those of the independently reviewed assessments in terms of the relative efficacy of the 2 arms.

Efficacy Analyses Considering Histology 
Results from previous randomized, Phase 3 studies in advanced NSCLC (Study JMEI and Study 
JMDB) indicated strong evidence of histology-by-treatment interactions for pemetrexed.  These 
interactions indicated that for patients treated with pemetrexed, those with non-squamous histology 
(adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and other or unknown histology) tend to have better survival 
and PFS compared to patients with squamous histology. 
Prespecified tests for histology-by-treatment interaction were performed using Cox models that 
included cofactors potentially prognostic for PFS and OS.  Based on the results of cofactor-adjusted 
analyses, most cofactors did not appear to be prognostic for either PFS or OS. Tests for interaction 
were stratified by the non-platinum component of induction therapy (gemcitabine versus 
paclitaxel/docetaxel) and included terms for treatment (pemetrexed versus placebo), squamous 
histology (no versus yes), treatment-by-squamous interaction (nonsquamous pemetrexed versus all 
other patients), ECOG performances status (0 versus 1), induction response (CR/PR versus SD), East 
Asian ethnicity (yes versus no), smoking status (never versus ever), gender (female versus male), and 
age (< 65 versus ≥ 65).  The platinum component of induction therapy and the stage of disease were 
the only factors omitted because they showed no tendency toward any prognostic effect. 
The results showed statistically significant interactions for PFS (interaction HR = 0.65; p = 0.036) and 
for OS (interaction HR = 0.66; p = 0.041). These tests confirmed the results seen in previous Phase 3 
studies (Study JMEI and Study JMDB), showing that patients with non-squamous histology in the 
pemetrexed arm tended to have better PFS and OS compared to patients with squamous cell histology.

Results for Specific Histologic Subgroups 
For the combined non-squamous population, there was a statistically significant PFS advantage for the 
pemetrexed arm compared to placebo (HR = 0.44; p-value < 0.00001). Median PFS within the 
squamous group was similar between arms (2.8 months for the pemetrexed arm versus 2.6 months for 
the placebo arm; HR = 0.69; p = 0.039), but the arms separated more clearly in favour of pemetrexed 
among patients who performed better than the medians.

For patients with non-squamous histology, results for preliminary median OS suggest a strong trend 
favoring the pemetrexed arm with a 5-month advantage for pemetrexed compared to placebo (14.4 
months versus 9.4 months; HR = 0.66; p = 0.005). Although not statistically significant, the 
preliminary OS results in patients with squamous histology suggest a disadvantage for pemetrexed 
(9.6 months) compared to placebo (11.9 months; HR = 1.28; p = 0.231). 
The final OS results in the non-squamous population indicated a significant improvement  of OS for 
the pemetrexed arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.88; p = 0.00196), representing a 
30% reduction in the risk of death for patients receiving pemetrexed. Median OS was 15.5 months for 
nonsquamous  patients  receiving  pemetrexed  and  10.3  months  for  non-squamous  patients  receiving 
placebo.  The  1-year  survival  rate  in  the  non-squamous  population  was  estimated  at  60%  for  the 
pemetrexed arm and 42% for the placebo arm.

Cofactor-Adjusted Efficacy Analyses in Specific Histologic Subgroups 
The treatment effect for non-squamous patients (HR = 0.45; 95% CI:  0.36 to 0.56; p < 0.0001) was 
similar to that observed in the unadjusted analysis of PFS for this population (HR = 0.44; 95% CI:  
0.36 to 0.55; p < 0.00001).  Results of cofactor-adjusted analyses for squamous cell patients 
(HR = 0.70; 95% CI:  0.49 to 1.01; p = 0.055) were also consistent with the unadjusted PFS results for 
this population (HR = 0.69; 95% CI:  0.49 to 0.98; p = 0.039).  The only cofactor with a statistically 
significant effect on PFS was gender (female versus male) in the non-squamous population (HR = 
0.77; 95% CI:  0.59 to 0.99; p = 0.040). 
In terms of cofactor-adjusted analyses for OS, treatment effect for non-squamous (HR = 0.64; 95% CI:  
0.48 to 0.86; p = 0.003) and squamous cell patients (HR = 1.26; 95% CI:  0.82 to 1.94; p = 0.296) 
were also consistent with those observed in the unadjusted analyses.

Quality of life- Overall Population 
The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) consists of nine 100-mm visual analogue scales, and scores 
are reported from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the best score.  The Average Symptom Burden Index 
(ASBI) was calculated from the average of the 6 symptom items (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, 
dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain).  A total score was calculated from the average of all 9 LCSS values 
(including the 6 symptom items, symptom distress, interference with activity level, and global quality 
of life).

Time to Worsening of Symptoms- Overall Population 
Time to worsening of symptoms (TWS) was measured from the date of randomization to the first date 
of worsening in each of the 6 symptoms and 3 summary items of the patient-reported LCSS.  Due to a 
high rate of censoring, median TWS of hemoptysis was not calculated.  There were no differences in 
any of the other TWS variables. Results were generally consistent with results for the analysis of TWS 
for the overall population.

Summary of Additional Analyses of LCSS Data 
Mean maximum improvement for each of the 9 LCSS items, the ASBI, and the total score were 
compared statistically between study arms.  Patients treated with pemetrexed had similar improvement 
in LCSS scores compared to those receiving placebo.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The new NSCLC maintenance treatment indication is supported by a multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (JMEN), that compared the efficacy and safety of maintenance 
treatment with Alimta plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 441) with that of placebo plus BSC (n= 
222)  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  (Stage  IIIB)  or  metastatic  (Stage  IV)  NSCLC  who  did  not 
progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing Cisplatin or Carboplatin in combination 
with  Gemcitabine,  Paclitaxel,  or  Docetaxel.  First  line  doublet  therapy  containing  Alimta  was  not 
included because the results of the first-line study with Alimta-cisplatin were not yet available.  
All  patients  included  in  this  study  had  an  ECOG  performance  status  of  0  or  1.  Patients  received 
maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of 
randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles 
of  maintenance  treatment  with  Alimta  and  3.5 cycles  of  placebo.  A  total  of  213 patients  (48.3%) 
completed  ≥ 6 cycles  and  a  total  of  103  patients  (23.4%)  completed  ≥ 10  cycles  of  treatment  with 
Alimta. 
The study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the 
Alimta arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of 4.0 months 
and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The independent 
review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS.  The median OS 
for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the Alimta arm and 10.6 months for the 
placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI:  0.65 to 0.95; p = 0.01192). 
Page 25 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with other Alimta studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was 
observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n= 
430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the Alimta arm and 1.8 
months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.37-0.60, p= 0.00001. The median OS for 
patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was 15.5 months 
for the Alimta arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI:  0.56-0.88, 
p=0.002).  Including the induction phase the median OS for patients with NSCLC other than 
predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the Alimta arm and 13.6 months for the 
placebo arm (hazard ratio =0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.88, p=0.002). 
The PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for Alimta 
over placebo.

Pivotal study JMEN is a multicentric trial that entered 741 patients from 83 investigational sites in 20 
countries.  Of these 741 patients, a total of 663 (89.5%) patients were randomized in the study: 441 to 
the  pemetrexed  arm  and  222  to  the  placebo  arm.  Of  the  441 patients  randomized  to  the  pemetrexed 
arm,  432 received  at  least  1  cycle  of  treatment.  Of  the  222 patients  randomized  to  the  placebo  arm, 
221 received at least 1 cycle of treatment.  
In accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis plan, all safety variables were evaluated at the 
time  of  the  primary  analysis  for  progression-free  survival  (PFS).  A  second  safety  analysis  was 
performed  approximately  6  months  after  the  primary  safety  analysis.  The  purpose  of  the  updated 
analysis  was  to  assess  event  rates  and  determine  if  there  were  any  new  safety  signals  from  patients 
with additional follow-up. 
At  the  time  of  the  second  safety  analysis,  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  received  a  median  of  5 
cycles, whereas patients in the placebo arm received a median of 3.5 cycles.  
The  percentage  of  patients  exposed  to  pemetrexed  for  at  least  6  cycles  was  48.3%,  which  is 
significantly greater than those in the placebo-treated group (27.5%) (p<0.0001). 
Ninety-eight  (22.2%)  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  19  (8.6%)  patients  in  the  placebo  arm 
completed at least 10 cycles (p < 0.001) at the time of the updated safety analysis.

A larger percentage of dose delays related to AEs occurred in the pemetrexed arm (71 patients; 16.1%) 
than in the placebo arm (13 patients; 5.9%). A total of 100 cycles of pemetrexed (0.6% of total cycles 
administered) and 18 cycles of placebo (0.5% of total cycles administered) were delayed due to AEs, 
regardless of causality. Taken together, AEs related to decreased renal function (creatinine clearance 
decreased,  glomerular  filtration  rate  decreased,  blood  creatinine  increased,  renal  function  test 
abnormal, and renal failure) accounted for the largest number of dose delays in the pemetrexed arm. 
Other commonly reported AEs causing dose delays in the pemetrexed arm included fatigue, asthenia, 
and bronchitis.

Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
In  the  pemetrexed  arm,  63%  of  patients  experienced  at  least  1  possibly  related  study  drug-related 
TEAEs  compared  to  35.1%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  (p<0.001).  In  both  study  arms,  the  most 
commonly reported possibly study drug-related TEAEs were nausea, fatigue, anorexia, and anaemia.  
Patients  receiving  pemetrexed  experienced  statistically  significantly  more  clinically  relevant  drug-
related  TEAEs  including  anaemia,  leukopenia,  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  nausea,  stomatitis, 
vomiting,  fatigue,  anorexia,  pyrexia,  increased  alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  increased  aspartate 
transaminase (AST), peripheral sensory neuropathy, rash, and decreased creatinine clearance.

According to the safety update analysis, a total of 65 patients died during the safety reporting period 
(while on study therapy or within 30 days after discontinuation).  Of the 65 reported deaths, there were 
22 deaths (12 [2.7%] in the pemetrexed arm  and 10 [4.5%]  in the placebo arm) that occurred while 
patients were on study or within 30 days of the last study dose. The remaining 43 deaths (31 [6.8%] in 
the  pemetrexed  arm  and  12  [5.4%]  in  the  placebo  arm)  occurred  greater  than  30  days  after  the  last 
study dose but within 30 days of study discontinuation. There were 11 deaths during study treatment 
(5 [1.1%] in the pemetrexed arm and 6 [2.7%] in the placebo arm]. Of the on-study treatment deaths, 5 
(1  [0.2%]  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  4  [1.8%]  in  the  placebo  arm)  were  attributed  to  disease 
progression.  The  remaining  6  deaths  were  caused  by  AEs  not  attributed  to  study  drug  by  the 
investigator. 
There  were  11  additional  deaths  within  30  days  of  last  study  dose  administered  (7  [1.6%]  in  the 
pemetrexed arm and 4 [1.8%] in the placebo arm). With the exception of 1 death in the pemetrexed 
arm  with  a  primary  event  of  dyspnea,  the  cause  of  death  for  these  patients  was  listed  as  disease 
progression.

The remaining 43 deaths occurred within the 30-day post discontinuation time period and were > 30 
days after last study dose; these deaths were primarily related to disease progression. 
As assessed by the investigator, no deaths were considered to be related to pemetrexed or placebo. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Possibly Related to Study Treatment 
All study-drug-related SAEs occurred in the pemetrexed arm, with 5.0% of patients in the pemetrexed 
arm  experiencing  at  least  1  event  (p  <  0.001).  However,  no  statistically  significant  differences  were 
observed  in  the  incidence  of  any  individual  SAE.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAE  was  anemia, 
which occurred in 1.4% of patients in the pemetrexed arm; all other SAEs occurred in less than 1% of 
patients. No serious, unexpected, reportable events (SURs) were reported.

Discontinuation due to Adverse Events (AEs) 
The incidence of discontinuation from study therapy due to AEs related to study drug was statistically 
significantly  higher  in  the  pemetrexed  arm:  21  (4.8%)  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  and  3  (1.4%) 
patients  in  the  placebo  (p  =  0.027).  The  majority  of  non-serious  drug-related  AEs  causing 
discontinuation (10 patients) from the pemetrexed arm were attributed to a decrease in renal function. 
Two  patients  discontinued  from  pemetrexed 
therapy  because  of  study-drug-related  SAEs 
(thrombocytopenia  and  pulmonary  fibrosis).  In  the  placebo  arm,  reason  for  discontinuation  was 
aspiration pneumonia and death.

a  Definition of frequency terms:  Very common - ≥ 10%; Common - > 5% and < 10%.  For the purpose of this 
table, a cutoff of 5% was used for inclusion of all events where the reporter considered a possible relationship 
to pemetrexed. 
b  Refer to NCI CTCAE Criteria (Version 3.0; NCI 2003) for each grade of toxicity 
Clinically relevant CTC toxicity of any grade that was reported in ≥1% and 5% (common) of the 
patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: decreased platelets, decreased creatinine 
clearance, constipation, edema, alopecia, increased creatinine, pruritis/itching, fever (in the absence of 
neutropenia), ocular surface disease (including conjunctivitis), increased lacrimation, and decreased 
glomerular filtration rate.  
Clinically relevant CTC toxicity that was reported in <1% (uncommon) of the patients that were 
randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: febrile neutropenia, allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, 
motor neuropathy, erythema multiforme, renal failure, and supraventricular arrhythmia. 
Grade 3/4 Toxicities Possibly Related to Study Treatment 
The  incidence  of  study-  drug-related  Grade  3/4  toxicities  was  statistically  significantly  higher  for 
pemetrexed  versus  placebo.    Only  neutropenia  (2.9%  versus  0.5%;  p = 0.006)  was  statistically 
significantly different between the 2 treatment arms. Consistent with the higher incidence of anemia in 
the pemetrexed arm, use of transfusions was significantly higher for patients receiving pemetrexed (42 
-9.5%)  compared to placebo (7 -3.2%). 
Page 33 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
Non laboratory Toxicities 
The  incidence  of  non-laboratory  toxicities  is  statistically  significantly  higher  in  the  pemetrexed  arm 
than  in  the  placebo  arm  (57.4%  versus  28.4%;  p < 0.001).    Individual  drug-related  non-laboratory 
toxicities  of  any  grade  occurring  significantly  more  frequently  for  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm 
included alopecia, anorexia, fatigue, fever without neutropenia, mucositis/stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, 
sensory  neuropathy,  oedema  of  the  limb,  rash,  and  renal/genitourinary  –  other  (decreased  creatinine 
clearance).  For  combined  drug-related  CTCAE  Grade  3  and  Grade  4  toxicities,  the  incidence  of 
patients with at least 1 adverse event was also significantly higher for patients in the pemetrexed arm 
(10.7%) compared to patients in the placebo arm (1.4%; p < 0.001).  The only statistically significant 
difference in the incidence of individual drug-related Grade 3/4 CTCAE non-laboratory toxicities was 
for  fatigue.  No  other  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between  study  arms  for  any 
other category of any grade or of Grade 3/4 non-laboratory toxicities. 
Adverse Events Related to Decreased Renal Function were specifically reviewed  
A  total  of  36  patients  were  identified  as  having  at  least  1  event  associated  with  decreased  renal 
function, which was possibly related to study drug. Thirty three patients in the pemetrexed arm (7.5%) 
were reported to have an AE associated with decreased renal function, which was possibly related to 
study  drug  according  to  investigator  report.  Of  these  33  patients,  10  (2.3%)  were  discontinued  from 
pemetrexed  due  to  their  drug-related  renal  AE,  and  1  patient  was  reported  to  have  a  SAE  of  renal 
failure (Grade 3) that required hospitalization. 
Only 3 patients in the placebo arm (1.4%) were reported to have an adverse event signifying decreased 
renal function and possibly related to study treatment. None of these were reported as Grade 3 or 4, 
none resulted in discontinuation from study treatment, and none were reported as an SAE. 
Safety in subgroups 
Analysis of toxicities by age, gender, and ethnic origin revealed the following significant results: 
- Patients < 65 years of age receiving pemetrexed experienced significantly higher rates of neutropenia 
and fatigue compared to patients receiving placebo (3.1% versus 0; p = 0.032 for both toxicities). The 
rate of individual Grade 3/4 laboratory and non-laboratory toxicities possibly related to study 
treatment was compared between age groups (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years). 
- No statistically significant differences were observed in the pemetrexed arm between patients < 65 
years of age and those ≥ 65 years of age. 
- For both males and females, a statistically significantly higher percentage of patients treated with 
pemetrexed, compared to patients receiving placebo, experienced at least 1 Grade 3/4 non-laboratory 
toxicity. Men receiving pemetrexed experienced statistically significantly higher rates of any Grade 
3/4 nonlaboratory toxicity, neutropenia, and fatigue, compared to men receiving placebo. No other 
statistically significant differences were observed between study arms for either male or female 
patients. 
- No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female patients treated with 
pemetrexed. 
- For patients of Caucasian origin, the only significant differences were observed in the incidence of 
Grade 3/4 toxicities of neutrophils/granulocytes decreased (p = 0.017) and fatigue (p = 0.001), with 
significantly more patients in the pemetrexed arm than in the placebo arm reporting these toxicities. 
- Statistically significantly more pemetrexed-treated patients of Caucasian origin reported Grade 3/4 
fatigue than those in the Other subgroup: 6.45% versus 0.62%; p = 0.003. No other statistically 
significant differences were observed. 
Page 34 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Analyses of safety for histological subgroups were generally consistent with the safety profiles for 
pemetrexed and placebo observed in the entire patient population. No clinically significant safety 
trends were identified that would suggest that 1 subgroup experienced a different toxicity profile of 
pemetrexed compared to other subgroups, or to the randomized or treated population as a whole. 
Effect on long-term exposure on patient safety 
The safety profile of pemetrexed has been well characterized in previous studies for patient exposures 
up to a median of 6 cycles. 
With  regard  to  long-term  maintenance  therapy,  29.5%  of  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  completed 
more  than  6  cycles.  Additional  analysis  of  possibly  drug-related  Grade  3  and  Grade  4  CTCAE 
toxicities comparing patients receiving ≤ 6 cycles and patients receiving > 6 cycles of pemetrexed did 
not  show  any  statistical  difference  between  these  groups.  In  addition,  no  statistically  significant 
differences were seen in any individual categories of laboratory or non-laboratory toxicities between 
the 2 groups. 
Key supportive studies 
Study JMEI is included as a key supportive study because it is a single-agent study in patients with 
NSCLC  after  prior  chemotherapy  treatment.  Study  JMEI  was  the  pivotal  study  for  approval  of 
pemetrexed  as  a  second-line,  single-agent  therapy  for  NSCLC.    The  study  used  the  same  dosage  of 
pemetrexed as in Study JMEN, and patients received the same vitamin supplementation regimen.   
The  eligibility  criteria  were  similar  between  the  studies,  with  notable  exceptions.    Study  JMEN 
excluded  patients  with  a  best  response  of  progressive  disease  (PD)  to  induction  (first-line) 
chemotherapy.  In contrast, Study JMEI included patients who had failed prior chemotherapy.  While 
Study  JMEN  only  enrolled  patients  with  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance status of 0 or 1, Study JMEI also included patients with an ECOG performance status of 
2. These differences may help explain some variations in safety observed between the 2 studies. 
In addition to the differences between the patient populations in Studies JMEN and JMEI, laboratory 
assessments  for  potential  toxicity  were  also  different.    In  Study  JMEI,  haematology  laboratory 
assessments were performed on Day 1 (prior to therapy), Day 8, and Day 15, and serum chemistries 
were  performed  on  Day  1  (prior  to  therapy)  and  Day  8  of  each  21-day  cycle.    The  JMEN  protocol 
required that haematology and serum chemistry assessments be performed only once during each 21-
day  cycle,  prior  to  study  drug  administration.    As  a  result,  the  incidence  and  severity  of  laboratory 
toxicity in Study JMEN could be lower than that observed in Study JMEI, in part due to less frequent 
assessments in Study JMEN. 
The  percentage  of  patients  completing  at  least  6  cycles  of  pemetrexed  was  higher  in  Study  JMEN 
(48.3%)  than  in  Study  JMEI  (34.0%),  which  may  in  part  be  explained  by  differences  between  the 
study populations. Further, the overall incidence of Grade ¾ toxicities was lower in Study JMEN than 
in Study JMEI.

Discussion on Clinical Safety 
The  safety  results  observed  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  of  Study  JMEN  are  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of pemetrexed. The incidence of toxicities in Study JMEN is generally lower than the 
incidence  observed  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  of  Study  JMEI  and  is  likely  to  be  reflective  of  the 
differences between the 2 studies patient populations and study designs. 
In the pivotal study JMEN, out of the 65 reported deaths (9.8% in the pemetrexed arm and 9.9% in the 
placebo  arm),  2.7%  occurred  while  on  study  therapy  or  less  than  30  days  after  last  dose  in  the 
pemetrexed  arm  versus  4.5%  in  the  placebo  arm.    No  study  drug-related  deaths  were  reported  for 
either  study  arm.  However,  according  to  the  provided  narratives,  data  for  causality  assessment  are 
Page 37 of 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
missing  in  some  cases  and  a  causal  relationship  between  adverse  events  leading  to  death  and  study 
drug can therefore not be definitely excluded in some cases.  
Overall,  more  patients  treated  with  pemetrexed  than  patients  treated  with  placebo  had  dose 
adjustments (4.8% in the pemetrexed arm/ 0.9% in the placebo arm). All pemetrexed dose adjustments 
were a result of adverse events. The incidence of drug-related toxicities was statistically higher in the 
pemetrexed arm compared to the placebo arm. Neutropenia and fatigue were statistically significantly 
different between the 2 treatment arms. 
The  most  common  toxicities  were  of  haematologic  origin,  gastro-intestinal  disorders  (nausea, 
vomiting, stomatitis), increased ASAT and ALAT and neuropathy. Renal toxicity was more common 
in  the  pemetrexed  arm;  33  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  (7.5%)  were  reported  to  have  a  possibly 
drug-related adverse event associated with decreased renal function. 
The most frequently reported SAE was anaemia, which occurred in 1.4% of patients in the pemetrexed 
arm;  all  other  SAEs  occurred  in  less  than  1%  of  patients.  No  serious,  unexpected,  reportable  events 
(SURs) were reported.  
With  regard  to  long-term  maintenance  therapy,  there  were  no  statistically  or  clinically  relevant 
differences  in  the  safety  profile  reported  for  patients  receiving  more  than  6  cycles  of  pemetrexed 
compared to those receiving 6 cycles or less. However, given the small number of patients remaining 
on treatment after 6 cycles, no conclusion can be drawn. 
Overall, the safety results for pemetrexed as a maintenance treatment were consistent with the known 
safety  profile  of  pemetrexed.  All  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing 
have been included in the SPC. The CHMP does not consider that any change to the PSUR cycle is 
necessary following this extension of indication.  
Pharmacovigilance 
An updated risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, 
was of the opinion that:  
 
 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
Benefit-risk assessment 
Efficacy 
The new NSCLC maintenance treatment indication is supported by a multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (JMEN), that compared the efficacy and safety of maintenance 
treatment with Alimta plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 441) with that of placebo plus BSC (n= 
222)  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  (Stage  IIIB)  or  metastatic  (Stage  IV)  NSCLC  who  did  not 
progress after 4 cycles of first line doublet therapy containing Cisplatin or Carboplatin in combination 
with  Gemcitabine,  Paclitaxel,  or  Docetaxel.  First  line  doublet  therapy  containing  Alimta  was  not 
included because the results of the first-line study with Alimta-cisplatin were not yet available.  
All  patients  included  in  this  study  had  an  ECOG  performance  status  of  0  or  1.  Patients  received 
maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of 
randomisation after completion of first line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles 
of  maintenance  treatment  with  Alimta  and  3.5 cycles  of  placebo.  A  total  of  213 patients  (48.3%) 
completed  ≥ 6 cycles  and  a  total  of  103  patients  (23.4%)  completed  ≥ 10  cycles  of  treatment  with 
Alimta.

The study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the 
Alimta arm over the placebo arm (n = 581, independently reviewed population; median of 4.0 months 
and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The independent 
review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS.  The median OS 
for the overall population (n = 663) was 13.4 months for the Alimta arm and 10.6 months for the 
placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI:  0.65 to 0.95; p = 0.01192). All time-to-event parameters 
were measured from the date of randomization upon completion of induction therapy. 
Consistent with other Alimta studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was 
observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n= 
430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the Alimta arm and 1.8 
months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.37-0.60, p= 0.00001. The median OS for 
patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n = 481) was 15.5 months 
for the Alimta arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI:  0.56-0.88, 
p=0.002).  Including the induction phase the median OS for patients with NSCLC other than 
predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the Alimta arm and 13.6 months for the 
placebo arm (hazard ratio =0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.88, p=0.002). 
The PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for Alimta 
over placebo.

The  safety  results  observed  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  of  Study  JMEN  are  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of pemetrexed. The incidence of toxicities in Study JMEN is generally lower than the 
incidence  observed  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  of  Study  JMEI  and  is  likely  to  be  reflective  of  the 
differences between the 2 studies patient populations and study designs. 
In the pivotal study JMEN, out of the 65 reported deaths (9.8% in the pemetrexed arm and 9.9% in the 
placebo  arm),  2.7%  occurred  while  on  study  therapy  or  less  than  30  days  after  last  dose  in  the 
pemetrexed  arm  versus  4.5%  in  the  placebo  arm.    No  study  drug-related  deaths  were  reported  for 
either  study  arm.  However,  according  to  the  provided  narratives,  data  for  causality  assessment  are 
missing  in  some  cases  and  a  causal  relationship  between  adverse  events  leading  to  death  and  study 
drug can therefore not be definitely excluded in some cases.  
Overall,  more  patients  treated  with  pemetrexed  than  patients  treated  with  placebo  had  dose 
adjustments (4.8% in the pemetrexed arm/ 0.9% in the placebo arm). All pemetrexed dose adjustments 
were a result of adverse events. The incidence of drug-related toxicities was statistically higher in the

pemetrexed arm compared to the placebo arm. Neutropenia and fatigue were statistically significantly 
different between the 2 treatment arms. 
The  most  common  toxicities  were  of  haematologic  origin,  gastro-intestinal  disorders  (nausea, 
vomiting, stomatitis), increased ASAT and ALAT and neuropathy. Renal toxicity was more common 
in  the  pemetrexed  arm;  33  patients  in  the  pemetrexed  arm  (7.5%)  were  reported  to  have  a  possibly 
drug-related adverse event associated with decreased renal function. 
The most frequently reported SAE was anaemia, which occurred in 1.4% of patients in the pemetrexed 
arm;  all  other  SAEs  occurred  in  less  than  1%  of  patients.  No  serious,  unexpected,  reportable  events 
(SURs) were reported.  
With  regard  to  long-term  maintenance  therapy,  there  were  no  statistically  or  clinically  relevant 
differences  in  the  safety  profile  reported  for  patients  receiving  more  than  6  cycles  of  pemetrexed 
compared to those receiving 6 cycles or less. However, given the small number of patients remaining 
on treatment after 6 cycles, no conclusion can be drawn. 
Overall, the safety results for pemetrexed as a maintenance treatment were consistent with the known 
safety profile of pemetrexed. With reference to the safety database, all adverse reactions reported in 
clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the SPC. The CHMP did not consider that any 
change to the current PSUR cycle was necessary following this extension of indication. 
An updated risk management plan was provided. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, 
was of the opinion that:  
 
 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
Overall Benefit/Risk 
Following the overall assessment of the efficacy and safety data provided, the CHMP concluded that 
the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  Alimta  is  positive  for  maintenance  treatment  of  NSCLC  and  agreed  on  the 
following final wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SPC:    
“Alimta is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in 
patients whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. 
First line treatment should be a platinum doublet with gemcitabine, paclitaxel or docetaxel (see 
Section 5.1).” 
All the proposed consequential changes to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC and the Package Leaflet can 
be agreed. 
Further,  the  MAH  has  updated  annex  IIB  to  reflect  the  latest  version  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan 
(version 2.1) agreed with the CHMP, which is acceptable. 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
On  29  May  2009  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

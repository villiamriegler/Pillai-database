1.   Executive Summary 
This document contains the assessment of the first round responses by the MAH.  
No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. 
2.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
The MAH submitted the results of a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study to assess safety and 
immunogenicity of 2 new formulations of the MAH's DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine compared to the 
licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine when co-administered with Prevenar 13 to healthy infants as a primary 
vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.  
The primary objective, i.e. non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of at least one of the novel DTPa-
HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine formulations compared to the licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine, was not met 
according to the criteria set for non-inferiority, as the immune response to the pertactin component of 
both novel formulations was not non-inferior to Infanrix Hexa. No divergent safety signals were 
detected in the comparison of the new formulation with the licensed Infanrix Hexa. 
The MAH should continue to investigate in pertussis vaccines that offer prolonged protection compared 
to the currently authorised vaccines in view of the resurgence of pertussis in fully vaccinated 
individuals which appears to be at least partly due to waning vaccine-induced immunity (Cherry, 
2012). 
A request for supplementary information was provided to the MAH, who is at current not able to 
submit a sufficiently detailed answer. A full report will be submitted by the MAH once all relevant data 
have been captured.  
No changes in the SmPC are warranted.  
3.  Request for supplementary information 
Request for supplementary information: In view of failure to show non-inferiority for both new 
formulations against the approved formulation in relation to immunogenicity, the applicant should 
clarify backup development strategy and consequential deliverables.

4.  MAH's RESponses to the RSI 
Question No. 1 - Regulatory 
In view of failure to show non-inferiority for both new formulations against the approved formulation in 
relation to immunogenicity, the applicant should clarify backup development strategy and 
consequential deliverables.

Company's answer: The Company has put on hold any further clinical development. Pre-clinical 
investigations are currently ongoing to try to identify the root cause for these observed differences. A 
comprehensive data pack will be available in 1H2013 to allow planning for the next steps. 
CHMP’s comment: The MAH's results are awaited for further evaluation.

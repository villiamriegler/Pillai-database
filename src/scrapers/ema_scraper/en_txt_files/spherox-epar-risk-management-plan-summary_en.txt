Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Spherox (spheroids of human 
autologous matrix-associated chondrocytes)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Spherox. The RMP details important risks 
of  Spherox,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Spherox' risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Spherox'  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Spherox should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Spherox should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of  the  RMP  for 
Spherox. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Spherox is authorised for repairing defects to the cartilage in the knee who have symptoms such as pain 
and  problems  moving  the  knee  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains  spheroids  of  human 
autologous matrix-associated chondrocytes as the active substance and it is given by implantation in the 
knee joint. 
For EU: Further information about the evaluation of Spherox’ benefits can be found in Spherox’ EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spherox.  
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks  
Important risks of Spherox, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Spherox' risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
 
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  case  of  Spherox,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation  measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment  so  that  immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Spherox is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Spherox are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Spherox. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicinal product is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicinal 
product).

(Niemeyer et al., 2008a) classified four (4) major complications for the need of a re-
surgery. These are (1) hypertrophy of the regenerated cartilage; (2) insufficient fusion 
of the regenerated cartilage and healthy cartilage at the edge of the former defect; (3) 
graft  failure  or  formation  of  an  insufficient  regenerative  cartilage  and  (4) 
delamination,  which  describes  a  shearing  of  the  regenerative  cartilage  from  the 
subchondral lamella in regularly formed cartilage tissue.  
(Harris et al., 2011) identified 82 studies for inclusion (5276 subjects were analysed; 
6080  defects)  with  305  failures  overall  (5.8%  subjects;  mean  time  to  failure  22 
months).  Re-operation  rate  after  periosteal  ACI  (PACI),  collagen-membrane  cover 
ACI  (CACI),  and  second-generation  ACI  was  36%,  40%,  and  18%,  respectively. 
Hypertrophy and delamination are most commonly seen after PACI. Female gender, 
age  over  40  years,  increased  weight, previous  cartilage  surgery,  and  meniscus  loss 
showed increased risk for revision surgery or graft failures (Martincic et al., 2019). 
Also (Merkely et al., 2020) concluded from their study results (368 patients (209 ACI 
and 159 OCA)) that hypertension, defect size and female gender seem to predict ACI 
graft failure. 
Patients with joint trauma or insufficient containment of the defect are supposed to 
have an increased risk.

Risk minimisation measures 
The majority of complications after ACI treatment can be summarised as hypertrophy 
of the implanted cartilage, malfusion, (partial) graft failure, and delamination. Among 
those, the overall complication rate and incidence of hypertrophy of the implant were 
higher for periosteum-covered ACI ((Gooding et al., 2006); (Driesang & Hunziker, 
2000); (Micheli et al., 2001); (Henderson et al., 2004); (Ebert et al., 2017)).  
Graft hypertrophy after ACI was seen in 22% (n = 20) of the patients (Niethammer et 
al., 2018).  
Furthermore,  an  increased  rate  of  symptomatic  hypertrophy  was  found  for  patellar 
defects (Niemeyer et al., 2008b). 
Risk groups or specific risk factors for implant hypertrophy in patients treated with 
Spherox are unknown.

(Pestka  et  al.,  2018)  reported  for  about  a  total  of  88  patients  (3.3%)  the  need  for 
revision surgery as early as 12 months postoperatively. The most common causes were 
arthrofibrosis and painful restriction of joint movement (1.0%), secondary meniscus 
abnormalities  (0.4%),  and  additional  cartilage  lesions  in  the  same  knee  joint  but  at 
another location (0.19%). Revision rates did not differ significantly among surgical 
techniques. 
(Niemeyer et al., 2008a) classified four (4) major complications for the need of a re-
surgery.  These  are  (1)  hypertrophy  of  the  regenerated  cartilage,  which  can  be 
suggested  if  within  the  debrided  defect  area,  a  mechanically  stable  regenerate  has 
formed that extends to the level of the native surrounding cartilage; (2) insufficient 
fusion  of  the  regenerated  cartilage  and  healthy  cartilage  at  the  edge  of  the  former 
defect,  which  can  be  diagnosed  if  after  ACI  an  intact  and  functionally  stable 
 
 
 
regenerative  tissue  has  formed  but  is  not  integrated  entirely  into  the  surrounding 
cartilage; (3) graft failure or formation of an insufficient regenerative cartilage and (4) 
delamination,  which  describes  a  shearing  of  the  regenerative  cartilage  from  the 
subchondral  lamella  in  regularly  formed  cartilage  tissue.  Osteochondral  defects 
(necrosis  of  the  subchondral  bone)  gave  indication  for  revision  surgery  in  3  cases 
(5.8%).  
(Harris et al., 2011) identified 82 studies for inclusion (5276 subjects were analysed; 
6080  defects)  with  305  failures  overall  (5.8%  subjects;  mean  time  to  failure  22 
months).  Re-operation  rate  after  periosteal  ACI  (PACI),  collagen-membrane  cover 
ACI (CACI), and second-generation ACI was 36%, 40%, and 18%, respectively.  
The  primary  reasons  for  chondroplasty  were  hypertrophy  of  the  ACI  graft  (17; 
periosteum  in  14,  collagen  membrane  in  3),  delamination  of  the  ACI  graft  (5; 
periosteum in 4, collagen membrane in 1), and new chondral lesions (3) (Ogura et al., 
2019). 
(Ackermann  et  al.,  2020a)  concluded  from  their  results  that  failures  of  graft 
survivorship  in  patients  (60)  who  underwent  ACI  for  the  treatment  of  focal  full-
thickness cartilage on the medial femoral condyle with and without concomitant high 
tibial  osteotomy  are  significantly  more  often  with  valgus  alignment.  (p=  0.0002), 
whereas neutral mechanical alignment resulted in a significantly longer graft survival 
compared with slight valgus alignment (p = 0.003 and p = 0.05, respectively). 
(Calcei et al., 2021) concluded from their retrospective cohort study that concomitant 
osteotomy at the time of index ACI or OCA procedure significantly reduces the risk 
of reoperation with a similar rate of complications and similar overall costs compared 
with  isolated  ACI  or  OCA.  They  compared  the  (1)  reoperation  rates,  (2)  30-day 
complication rates, and (3) cost differences between patients undergoing isolated ACI 
or osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) procedures alone versus patients with 
concomitant osteotomy. Patients with knee ACI or OCA with minimum 2-year follow-
up were queried from a US national insurance database and divided into patients who 
underwent  isolated  cartilage  restoration  procedure  and  patients  who  underwent 
concomitant osteotomy. A total of 1,113 patients (402 ACI, 67 ACI + osteotomy, 552 
OCA,  92  OCA  +  osteotomy)  were  found  (mean  follow-up  of  39.0  months). 
Reoperation  rate  defined  by  ipsilateral  knee  procedure  after  the  index  surgery  was 
significantly  higher  after  isolated  ACI  or  OCA  compared  to  ACI  or  OCA  plus 
concomitant  osteotomy  (ACI  68.7%  vs.  ACI  +  osteotomy  23.9%;  OCA  34.8%  vs. 
OCA  +  osteotomy  16.3%).  Overall  complication  rates  (assessed  using  ICD-9-CM 
codes) were similar between isolated ACI (3.0%) and ACI + osteotomy (4.5%) groups 
and OCA (2.5%) and OCA + osteotomy (3.3%) groups. Payments were significantly 
higher in the osteotomy groups at day of surgery and 9 months compared to isolated 
ACI or OCA, but costs were similar by 2 years postoperatively.  
Patients with joint trauma or insufficient containment of the defect are supposed to 
have an increased risk. 
Female gender, age over 40 years, increased weight, previous cartilage surgery, and 
meniscus loss showed increased risk for revision surgery or graft failures (Martincic 
et al., 2019).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Most surgical infections originate from bacteria that enter the  wound at the time of 
operation.  The  causative  pathogens  originate  from  the  patient’s  endogenous 
microflora,  from  the  operating  room  environment,  or  from  organisms  shed  by  the 
operating room team (Cristina et al, 2016; Pittet & Ducel, 1994). Infection is a rare 
complication of knee arthroscopies of below 1% (Sircana et al, 2019). (Harris et al., 
2011; Sircana et al., 2019) reported superficial and deep infection as one complication 
after ACI resulting into transplant failure and need for re-surgery after ACI. (Pestka et 
al., 2018) reported infection (n= 10) among the most common causes for a revision 
surgery  after  cartilage  regenerative  surgery  of  the  knee  (including  ACI  and  bone 
marrow stimulation). 
Patients  with  osteoarthritis  (contraindication  for  Spherox)  or  other  inflammation

(Ebert et al., 2017) prospectively evaluated the first 31 patients (15 male, 16 female) 
who underwent MACI via arthroscopic surgery to address symptomatic tibiofemoral 
chondral lesions (medial femoral condyle (n = 5), lateral femoral condyle (n = 1), and 
lateral  tibial  plateau  (n  =  1).  No  early  postoperative  complications,  such  as  wound 
infections, haematomas, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), that may be observed more 
commonly in more invasive techniques were found.  
Adverse  outcome  after  elective  knee  arthroscopies  measures  included  pulmonary 
embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), haemarthrosis, effusion and synovitis, 
cellulitis,  wound  infection,  synovial  fistula,  acute  renal  failure,  myocardial  infarct, 
stroke, and death.  The most common adverse outcomes within 30 days were DVT 
(579, 0.32%), effusion and synovitis (154, 0.09%), PE (147, 0.08%), and hemarthrosis 
(134,  0.07%).  Potential  risk  factors  for  complications  were  older  age,  presence  of 
comorbidity (Bohensky et al., 2013). 
Risk factors are related to the medical history and/or concomitant medication of the 
patient.

The  cartilage  tissue  is  strongly  related  to  its  surrounding  organic  environment  and 
particularly sensitive to small alterations in features such as oxygen saturation, heat 
and pH. 
Antibiotics  are  the  most  common  additives  used  in  irrigation  solutions  for  open 
fractures including open joint fractures. Few studies have investigated the toxic effects 
of  antibiotics  on  articular  cartilage,  all  were  in  vitro  or  short-term  in  vivo  studies 
without  considering  the  potential  recovery  of  chondrocytes  ((Akgun  et  al.,  2014, 
Anglen, 2005, Cheng et al., 2004, Chu et al., 2010, Gradinger et al., 1995, Lescun et

Important potential risk           Transmission of infectious agent/disease 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Infectious disease transmission through organ and tissue transplantation has been 
associated with severe complications in recipients  (Greenwald et al, 2012). The 
transmission  of  donor-derived  infections  is  relatively  efficient  with  viable  cells 
and tissue as well as blood  (Fishman et al, 2012). Donor-derived infections are 
less  relevant  for  Spherox  treatment  since  donor  and  recipient  are  the  same,  but 
contamination during transport and cell cultivation has to be taken into account. 
Some studies consider preservation-fluid contamination including those occurring 
during the procurement process (Yahav & Manuel, 2019), but little is known about 
the incidences for this subgroup.  
HCPs can be infected by parenteral injection of blood, or through exposure of the 
skin or mucous membranes to blood or other body fluids. The nature and frequency 
of  blood  contact  among  surgical  personnel  have  been  studied  prospectively. 
Between 6% and 50% of operations involved one or more blood contacts, and one 
or more sharp injuries were noted in from 1.3% to 15.4% of procedures.  These 
varied with the type of surgery and, within each specialty, procedure-specific rates 
are available. Serological surveillance of several thousand HCPs has shown that 
the risk of HIV seroconversion after a single percutaneous exposure is of the order 
of 0.3%, much less than that reported for hepatitis at 10% for HCV and 30% for 
HBV (Lemaire & Masson, 2000).  
Spherox is solely intended for autologous use, the donor of the biopsy material is 
also the recipient of the finished medicinal product. Contamination with infectious 
agents  might  occur  during  tissue  procurement,  transport  and  cell  cultivation. 
Patients undergoing Spherox treatment are tested for HIV I/II, HBV, HCV, and 
syphilis prior to the implantation procedure.  
The biopsy procedure and Spherox treatment may carry the risk of transmitting of 
infectious agents/disease to HCPs as well as to personnel at the manufacturing site 
handling  these  tissues  and  blood  samples.  Both  HCPs  and  personnel  at  the 
manufacturing  site  undergo  strict  safety  precautions  in  handling  the  biopsy 
material, blood samples and Spherox.

and administration) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The  initial  cartilage  biopsy  and  the  harvest  of  autologous  chondrocytes  are  key 
steps at the beginning of every ACI procedure. These steps remain independent 
from different ACI techniques. The biopsy needs to assure that sufficient amounts 
of vital cartilage tissue can be collected without extensive donor side le morbidity. 
A standardized procedure will reliably and safely allow the extraction of sufficient 
quantities  of  cartilage  samples.  Standardized  biopsies  simplify  chondrocyte 
isolation and cell expansion and guarantee safety and consistent quality (Niemeyer 
et al., 2010).  
Some trans-arthroscopic graft positioning is difficult to perform with a constant 
flow  of  saline  and  the  inflow  sometimes  needs  to  be  reduced  or  stopped.  The 
disadvantage  is  that  the  joint  capsule  may  then  collapse  and  the  sight  for 
implantation will be reduced (Brittberg, 2019). 
Defect  aetiology  and  quality  of  the  cells  are  decisive  for  the  clinical  outcome 
(Pietschmann et al., 2009). 
Cell quality seems to be one of many factors that influences clinical outcome after 
ACI in patients with cartilage defects of the knee joint (Niemeyer et al., 2012). 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk factors related to the procedure (e.g. procurement of raw material, storage, 
transport and administration of the finished medicinal product) have an impact on 
the biological activity of the ATMP and, thus, might lead to lack of efficacy and 
as a consequence to transplant failure.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Infections due to resistant Gram-positive bacteria are increasingly common in paediatric patients. The 
major target for daptomycin is S. aureus, an organism in which daptomycin resistance is rare. Serious 
infections due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular 
are a major health problem worldwide. Few antibiotics with activity against MRSA or other serious 
Gram-positive bacteria are currently available, and fewer still have had their safety and efficacy carefully 
evaluated in paediatric patients. 
Daptomycin for injection (licensed as CUBICIN [hereafter referred to as daptomycin]) is a cyclic 
lipopeptide antibacterial derived from the fermentation of a strain of Streptomyces roseosporus. The 
mechanism of action of daptomycin is distinct from that of any other antibacterial agent. Daptomycin 
binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of 
membrane potential inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein synthesis, 
which results in bacterial cell death. Daptomycin has potent in vitro activity against S. aureus, including 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. 
Daptomycin is supplied in single-use vials containing 500 mg daptomycin as a sterile, lyophilized powder. 
In some regions of the world, single-use vials containing 350 mg daptomycin as a sterile, lyophilized 
powder are also available. 
Cubicin was approved in the EU in January 2006, for treatment of adult with complicated skin and soft 
tissue infections (cSSTI). The recommended dosing was 4 mg/kg once daily. In October 2007 the 
indications was extended in adults to include Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB), right sided 
infective endocarditis (RIE) due to S. aureus and SAB when associated with RIE or with cSSTI. The 
recommended daily dose for these indications is 6 mg/kg once daily. The current indication which also 
includes paediatric patients (1-17 years of age (yoa)) with cSSTI was approved in October 2015.  
The recommended paediatric dosing (once every 24 hrs) for cSSTI are as follows: 12-17 yoa: 5 mg/kg, 
7-11 yoa: 7 mg/kg, 2-6 yoa: 9 mg/kg and 1 to<2 yoa: 10 mg/kg. Duration of treatment is up to 14 days. 
Clinical studies and post-marketing pharmacovigilance have demonstrated a well-characterized safety 
profile for daptomycin in adults. To date, the safety of daptomycin in the paediatric population appears to 
be comparable to that observed in adults. In clinical studies of daptomycin in both adults and paediatric 
patients, most adverse events (AEs) were characterized as mild or moderate in intensity and were not 
attributed to the study drug. Overall, the most frequently reported AEs in paediatric patients were in the 
following system organ classes (SOCs): gastrointestinal disorders, investigations and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders. Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was reported as an AE more 
frequently in patients treated with daptomycin than in patients receiving placebo or comparator 
antibiotics. 
Current application 
The MAH has performed a number of studies to support the efficacy, safety and PK/PD in the paediatric 
population (please refer to table, section 2.3.1). 
 
Studies DAP-PEDS-05-01, DAP-PEDS-07-02, DAP-PEDS-09-01, DAP-PEDS-07-03 have been assessed 
previously. Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 was assessed in connection with the approval of the extension to 
paediatric patients with cSSTI (EMEA/H/C/000637/II/0053/G). 
The MAH’s purpose of this Type II variation is to extend the S. aureus bacteraemia associated with cSSTI 
indication for daptomycin to include paediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age. 
The proposed additional doses in the bacteraemia indication in children ages 1 to 17 years are as follows: 
• Age 12 to 17 years old: 7 mg/kg once daily 
• Age 7 to 11 years old: 9 mg/kg once daily 
• Age 1 to 6 years old: 12 mg/kg once daily 
In support of this proposal, the applicant has provided a clinical study report on DAP-PEDBAC-11-02.  
In addition, the application also includes: 
An integrated safety study data for daptomycin across the paediatric program is included in the data 
package. These include:  
• 
• 
a Phase 4 efficacy and safety study in paediatric subjects with cSSSI (Paediatric Phase 4 cSSSI 
study [DAP-PEDS-07-03], and  
three Phase 1 single-dose clinical studies in paediatric subjects ([DAPPEDS-05-01], 
[DAP-PEDS-07-02], and [DAPPEDS-09-01].  
It is noted that study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was assessed under the Article 46. The procedure 
(EMA/H/C/0637/P46) has been completed. During the procedure the UK rapporteur raised two issues:  
1. The incidence of short bowel syndrome was higher in the daptomycin vs control group. Please provide 
details and provide further comment.  
2. There were a high number of major protocol violations. Please comment on whether these had any 
impact on the safety/ efficacy conclusions. 
The final assessment report concluded that MAH responded adequately to both issues. Thus, these issues 
will not be discussed further in this assessment report.  
Moreover, the final assessment report of the Article 46 procedure EMA/H/C/0637/P46 concluded that      
“… no new adverse events of concern were identified and the safety data from the paediatric patients in 
this study were consistent with the known safety profile of daptomycin. The efficacy data showed 
daptomycin to achieve outcomes similar to other SOC treatments while PK data were as expected.” 
Paediatric requirements 
There are no requirements applicable for this application according to the Paediatric Regulation. 
In the US, the paediatric Phase 4 SAB study ([DAP-PEDBAC-11-02]) was a post-marketing FDA 
requirement (PMR) under PREA (PMR 804-7) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daptomycin for the 
treatment of bacteraemia in paediatric subjects.  
In Europe, this study is reportable according to Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulations. The 
DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 clinical study report (CSR) was submitted to EMA on 20-Jun-2016, consistent with 
the timelines required for Article 46 submissions. With the present submission, the MAH proposes to 
extend the S. aureus bacteraemia indication for daptomycin to include paediatric patients 1 to 17 years of 
age. 
 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data, except on clinical microbiology, have been submitted in this application. 
Also an ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment has been provided (original ERA submitted during the 
assessment). 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Clinical microbiology 
The major target organism in this disease is S. aureus, an organism in which daptomycin resistance is 
rare. Daptomycin has potent in vitro activity against S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
(MRSA) strains. 
Development of daptomycin-resistance during therapy has been identified. The mechanisms of resistance 
to this agent appear to be diverse. Strains that are non-susceptible to daptomycin often exhibit 
accumulation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the multipeptide resistance factor gene (mprF) and 
the yycFG genes in the yycFGHI operon. Both of these loci are known to be involved in key cell membrane 
function.  
Daptomycin-resistant strains demonstrate other changes in the cell membrane physiology including 
resistance to cell membrane depolarization and permeabilisation, and reduced surface binding of 
daptomycin. Additionally, modifications of the cell wall may also contribute to daptomycin resistance, 
including enhanced expression of the dlt operon and progressive cell wall thickening. 
Data from US and EU surveillance studies of daptomycin against Gram-positive clinical isolates are shown 
in the tables below. Overall, daptomycin was active against staphylococci. Only six S. aureus strain 
(0.11%) showed a reproducible daptomycin MIC value greater than 1 μg/mL. All CoNS strains were 
susceptible to daptomycin.

2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An original environmental risk assessment has been submitted during the procedure, with only Phase I 
testing completed. 
According to the MAH, the extension of indication will not result in a substantial change in sale. However, 
the PEC calculation appearing in the original ERA cannot be agreed to. In case of adults, the PEC surface 
water is 3.6 µg/l; in case of children 0.48 µg/l. Even in case it is assumed that adults are only treated for 
14 days per year, the PEC surface water is 0.08 µg/l and thus higher than the action limit of 0.01 µg/l. 
Therefore, a Phase II ERA is required for Cubicin.  
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the assessment of the initial marketing authorisation application for Cubicin (submitted in 2005), it was 
concluded that daptomycin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. This conclusion was solely 
based on a refined PECsurface water= 0.0016 µg/l and the logKow value. An application for extension of 
indication to include children with cSSTI was approved in 2015 (EMEA/H/C/0637/II/053/G). For that 
application, the 1.4 %/year increase in sale estimated by the applicant did not trigger any request for 
environmental data. 
The justification forwarded by the applicant in both the current and the previous application for paediatric 
indication was based on market forecast data, and thus not in line with the guidance document on 
environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). The PEC calculation appearing in the 
original ERA cannot be agreed to and Phase II ERA results should subsequently be submitted. 
 
 
 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: Phase II ERA results to be submitted by 
end of March 2019.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The previously performed paediatric studies (three Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trials in patients with 
confirmed or suspected Gram-positive infections 1 to 17 years of age (DAP-PEDS-05-01, 
DAP-PEDS-07-02, and DAP-PEDS-09-01, and one Phase 4 safety, efficacy and PK study 
DAP-PEDS-07-03) have demonstrated that daptomycin exposures are generally lower in paediatric 
patients compared with adults at the same dose, with weight normalized clearance inversely related to 
age. 
The two-compartment population PK model derived from existing adult and paediatric PK data has been 
evaluated in connection with the previously approved paediatric cSSTI indication, where daptomycin 
doses and dosing regimens in paediatric populations were selected by leveraging the available PK data in 
the adult population. 
The dosing regimen used for the different age groups in study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 [Table 2.5: 1] was 
derived from this same model, and was based on matching target exposure in the paediatric subjects with 
the adult SAB population for which efficacy and safety has been established. PK data (peak and trough) 
was collected during the present study to confirm exposure and PK variables. 
The PK data presented in the study report for DAP- PEDBAC-11- 02 show that daptomycin exposures in 
paediatric SAB patients following administration of the age-specific, weight-based dosing regimens are 
largely contained within the range observed in adult SAB patients, including RIE patients, receiving the 
approved 6 mg/kg dose (Figure 2.5:1). 
The key PK parameters estimated from the paediatric SAB patients are shown in Table 4 below. 
In an exposure-response analysis, no statistically significant correlation between CPK elevation and 
daptomycin exposure in paediatric subjects was identified within the exposures attained at the 
recommended age-specific, weight-based paediatric dosing regimens for cSSSI or SAB. 
In conclusion, at the evaluated dosing regimens, the exposures in paediatric patients with SAB are 
comparable to the exposures in adult SAB/RIE patients and similar efficacy and safety profiles in 
paediatric and adult patients were demonstrated.  
In paediatric subjects with SAB, following administration of multiple doses at the proposed age-specific, 
weight-based regimen in (Table 2.5: 1), model-predicted total clearance normalized by body weight 
(CL/WT), total volume of distribution normalized by weight (Vss/WT) and elimination half-life (t1/2) 
varied across different age groups as shown in Table below.

In order to produce steady-state exposure (AUCss) comparable to 6 mg/kg once-daily dosing in the adult 
SAB population (mean AUC 622 µg*hr/mL) the dosing shown in Table 5 were selected for the paediatric 
patients with SAB.

The selected dosing regimen for the various paediatric age groups with SAB are considered justified. 
However, for this study with higher dosing no study subjects were below 2 y of age. Still, the 
dose-exposure, and thus efficacy, seems most likely appropriate even for this lower age group based on 
the previously available PK data. The applicant further discussed how the safety data obtained in this 
study and the integrated safety analysis also, is valid for this lowest age group. Together with the 
observations that (1) the simulated exposure distribution in paediatric SAB patients 1 to <2 years of age 
receiving the 60-minute 12 mg/kg daptomycin IV infusion is not higher than that in paediatric SAB 
patients 2 to 6 years of age receiving the same dosing regimen, and (2) the PK-CPK analysis that 
demonstrated no clinically meaningful increase in CPK at the exposures achieved with the proposed 
paediatric SAB and the approved cSSSI doses, the CPK-age analysis supports that no clinically meaningful 
increase in CPK for paediatric SAB patients 1 to <2 years at the 60-minute 12 mg/kg daptomycin IV 
infusion is expected. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No new in vitro human biomaterial studies have been conducted in support of this paediatric application.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of daptomycin is distinct from that of any other antibacterial. Daptomycin binds 
to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of 
membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell 
death. As such, this mechanism is not expected to be different in adult and paediatric patients. 
Based on animal models of infection, the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin correlates with ratio of area 
under the “concentration-time curve” over “minimum inhibitory concentration” (AUC /MIC). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The selected dosing regimen for the various paediatric age groups with SAB are considered justified. 
However, for this study with higher dosing no study subjects were below 2 y of age. Still, the 
dose-exposure, and thus efficacy, seems most likely appropriate even for this lower age group based on 
the previously available PK data. 
PK modelling data supports the 12mg/kg dose in the youngest children 1-<2 year of age, with no 
concerns of efficacy or safety being revealed. This dose results in slightly higher exposure of 20% 
compared to the 10mg/kg dose, though no CPK increases were reported. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The selected dosing regimen for the various paediatric age groups with SAB are considered justified. The 
MAH further discussed how the safety data obtained in this study and the integrated safety analysis also, 
is valid for this lowest age group.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
DAP-PEDBAC-11-02: A COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY 
OF DAPTOMYCIN VERSUS STANDARD OF CARE IN PEDIATRIC SUBJECTS ONE TO SEVENTEEN 
YEARS OF AGE WITH BACTEREMIA CAUSED BY STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS. 
DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 is an open label (Evaluator-blinded), comparative, multi-centre, multi-national study 
designed to describe the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) daptomycin versus standard of care 
(SOC) in paediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years with S. aureus bacteraemia. 
Methods 
Study duration: 06 March 2013 to 20 January 2016. 
DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was conducted initially in paediatric patients between the ages of > 4 and 17 years. 
Following review of safety data by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), the protocol was 
sequentially amended to allow enrolment of paediatric subjects down to 1 year of age.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were enrolled sequentially into three age groups and treated with daptomycin or SOC, based on 
a 2:1 randomization. Study medication was initiated based on a diagnosis of proven or probable S. aureus 
bacteraemia.  
• 
• 
Proven infections: those with S. aureus identified from at least one blood culture bottle by 
conventional culture methods or by a rapid diagnostic test within 3 days prior to first dose of study 
drug.  
Probable infections: those with a preliminary blood culture result demonstrating Gram-positive cocci 
in clusters upon Gram stain, suggestive of a staphylococcal infection.  
o  Only high risk subjects with persistent bacteraemia could continue treatment if 
coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) were confirmed after the subject was enrolled. This 
was done to ensure that only subjects with true bacteraemia due to CoNS received study 
drug. Subjects at high risk included, but were not limited to, immunocompromised children, 
cancer patients, or those with a potential source of infection from devices or IV catheters that 
were not intended to be removed. In such cases the Sponsor-designated Medical Monitor was 
contacted to continue treatment. 
By Days 5 to 7, each subject’s bacteraemia was further classified as complicated or uncomplicated as 
follows:  
•  Uncomplicated bacteraemia: The absence of positive results for S. aureus in cultures obtained 2 
to 4 days after the initiation of study therapy; no fever after 72 hours of initiating effective 
therapy; no evidence of metastatic sites of infection; no evidence of endocarditis; and no 
implanted devices. 
•  Complicated bacteraemia: Bacteraemia occurring in patients with positive blood cultures who do 
not meet criteria for uncomplicated bacteraemia. 
Subjects were excluded if they had previous systemic antimicrobial therapy effective against S. aureus 
exceeding 72 hours in duration administered anytime during the 96 hours prior to the first dose of study 
drug; with the exception: Subject was eligible if culture data demonstrated in vitro resistance to prior IV 
antibiotic. 
Subjects may have switched to oral therapy following completion of IV study drug administration 
provided they showed clear clinical improvement and the pathogen was susceptible to an oral agent. 
The choice of IV comparator (if randomized to SOC arm) and oral therapy agents was left to the discretion 
of the Investigator based on the local SOC. Duration of study medication (either treatment arm) was 
guided by ranges provided in the protocol; however, the duration for a specific patient was left to the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
At randomization, all subjects were stratified by age and whether the bacteraemia was complicated or 
uncomplicated. By Day 5 to Day 7, each subject’s bacteraemia was classified and they were randomized 
to receive 5 to 42 days of study drug depending on the source of infection, presence of endovascular 
infection, and metastatic foci of infection. Each subject was evaluated by a blinded Evaluator between 7 
to 14 days after their last dose of study drug (IV or Oral) at the TOC/Safety Visit. A Last Follow-up Visit 
occurred 25 to 35 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Safety assessments included AEs classification of bacteraemia, focused neurological examination, motor 
developmental skills (for subjects <7 years old), laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital 
signs. 
 
 
 
 
Study Schematic 
Study participants 
Approximately 75 subjects with proven S. aureus bacteraemia were planned. A total of 65 study sites 
world-wide (Greece, Israel, Romania, Ukraine, Argentina, Brazil, Panama, Australia, Malaysia, and 
Thailand) received study medication, and 25 study sites actually enrolled subjects. A total of 82 paediatric 
patients age 1-17 year of age were included, of which 55 subjects were randomized to receive daptomycin 
and 27 to receive SOC.  
The analysis populations were as follows: 
•  Safety Population: included all subjects who received any dose of IV study medication 
(daptomycin or comparator).  
• 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT): included all randomized subjects including those who were not exposed to 
any test product, and were analysed based on the treatment to which they were randomized. 
•  Modified Intent-to-Treat (MITT) Population: included all randomized and treated subjects 
receiving at least one dose of study drug who met the clinical criteria for the study infection at 
Baseline (positive blood culture for S. aureus or Coagulase Negative Staph (CoNS) in high risk 
patients or probable bacteraemia [Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain at Baseline]). 
•  Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (mMITT) Population: included all MITT subjects who had 
proven S. aureus bacteraemia at Baseline. 
•  Clinically Evaluable (CE) Population: The CE population was a subpopulation of the mMITT 
including subjects who met specific criteria related to the required assessments: 
o  Received the correct drug, as randomized  
o  Received appropriate duration of treatment (minimum and maximum treatment 
durations) 
o  Had the necessary clinical and microbiological efficacy evaluations performed at the 
TOC/Safety Visit and were not evaluated as “non-evaluable” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Did not receive effective systemic confounding antibiotics at Baseline (>72 hours 
administered duration anytime during the 96 hours prior to the first dose) 
o  Did not receive more than 1 dose of effective systemic non-study antibiotics from the first 
dose of study drug to the TOC/Safety Visit. 
• 
Exposure Response Population: The Exposure Response population included any subject with at 
least 1 peak or trough sample (for daptomycin plasma concentration). 
Treatments 
Ages 7 to 17 years: 
Daptomycin was dissolved in a volume of 50 mL 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, United 
States Pharmacopoeia (USP) (normal saline [NS]) and administered via IV over 30 minutes 
(Infusion rate: 1.67 mL/min): 
• 
• 
For ages 12 to 17 years: 7 mg/kg IV once every 24 hours (q24h) 
For ages 7 to 11 years: 9 mg/kg IV q24h 
Ages 1 to 6 years: 
Daptomycin was dissolved to 12 mg/kg in a volume of 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride for 
injection, USP (NS) and administered IV over 60 minutes q24h (Infusion rate: 0.42 mL/min). 
Reference therapy: 
The comparators for this study were SOC agents deemed appropriate by the Investigator. The 
recommended SOC comparator agents were intravenously administered medications as follows:  
vancomycin, clindamycin, semi-synthetic penicillins [nafcillin, oxacillin, or cloxacillin], or first-generation 
cephalosporins.

c Children under 12 years of age who were classified as having complicated bacteremia after IV treatment was started 
and who responded to treatment by Day 28 but who required additional IV treatment may have continued on IV 
daptomycin or SOC if benefit outweighed the potential safety risk. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objectives 
The primary objective:  
To assess the safety of IV daptomycin versus standard of care antibiotics in paediatric subjects aged 1 to 
17 years of age with bacteraemia. 
Secondary objective: 
To compare the efficacy of IV daptomycin versus standard-of-care antibiotics in paediatric subjects aged 
1 to 17 years of age with bacteraemia caused by S. aureus; 
To determine exposure by measuring plasma levels of daptomycin at pre-dose (Ctrough) and end of 
infusion (Cmax) to explore exposure-response analyses in paediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years of age 
with bacteraemia. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary end-point analysis – Safety:  
Safety was assessed by clinical review and interpretation of all safety parameters. Adverse events were 
coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 
17.1). The overall pattern and incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, treatment related AEs, severe AEs, 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and other medically important AEs including clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory values was used to evaluate safety.  
Other safety parameters included: vital signs; echocardiogram (if performed), and clinical laboratory 
tests including serum CPK, results of physical examinations and focused neurological examinations, and 
use of concomitant medications.  
Clinical laboratory values outside the normal ranges were tabulated and flagged. Descriptive statistics for 
the visit values and the change from Baseline values were presented by study visit, and overall based on 
maximum post-Baseline visit for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs. Cmax and Ctrough daptomycin 
concentrations were evaluated for correlation to any AEs in the SMQ categories of Peripheral Neuropathy 
and or Rhabdomyolysis/Myopathy. 
Safety was assessed for the entire study period from the administration of the first dose of study 
medication through the Last Follow-up Visit (25 to 35 days after the last dose of study drug). 
Secondary end-point analysis – Efficacy: 
The secondary endpoint for efficacy was clinical outcome based on a blinded Investigator’s (also known as 
blinded Evaluator’s) assessment of clinical response at the Test-of-cure (TOC)/Safety Visit (primarily in 
the mMITT population). An assessment of cure or improved was considered clinical success (see definition 
below). The TOC visit was at Days +7 to + 14 after last dose. 
Another secondary efficacy endpoint was the overall outcome based on the subject’s microbiological 
response and clinical outcome at the TOC/Safety Visit in the mMITT population. Microbiological response 
was determined as microbiological success, failure, or non-evaluable based on evaluation of Baseline 
infecting pathogen. Clinical outcome was determined as success, failure, or non-evaluable as described 
 
 
 
for the first secondary efficacy outcome. Overall outcome was a success if both clinical and microbiological 
outcomes were successful. 
The subjects clinical response were assessed by the blinded Evaluator at the End of IV Therapy (EOIV) 
visit, the End of Oral Therapy (EOT) visit (for subjects who receive oral study drug), and the TOC/Safety 
Visit using the following categories: 
•  Cure: Resolution of clinically significant signs and symptoms associated with admission infection 
(i.e. return to pre-infection Baseline). No further antibiotic therapy required for the primary 
infection under study. 
• 
• 
Improvement: Partial resolution of clinical signs or symptoms of infection such that no further 
antibiotic therapy is required for the primary infection under study. For subjects that are switched 
from IV study drug to oral study drug, “Improved” at the EOIV Visit is defined as the partial 
resolution of clinical signs or symptoms of infection such that no further IV antibiotic therapy is 
required for the primary infection under study. 
Failure: Inadequate clinical response to therapy, so that additional antibiotic therapy was 
required for primary infection under study. 
•  Not evaluable: Subject was not available to be examined and assessed. 
For all secondary endpoint analyses, the 95% CI was calculated for each treatment group. The difference 
between the treatment groups was calculated with a 95% CI around the difference between the 
treatment groups. The secondary endpoint was analysed by treatment arm and by treatment arm and 
age group.  
Subgroup analysis were performed by Baseline infection pathogen subgroups (methicillin-sensitive S. 
aureus [MSSA], methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), classification of bacteraemia (complicated, 
uncomplicated), and by subjects that received only IV therapy and subjects that received IV plus oral 
therapy. 
Sample size 
This study was not powered for safety or efficacy. Approximately 75 children with proven S. aureus 
bacteraemia cases were to be enrolled in the study. Paediatric patients were randomized 2:1 to 
daptomycin: SOC, respectively (with approximately 50 on daptomycin and approximately 25 on SOC 
planned). 
The probability of observing a specific AE with a true rate of 5% among 50 subjects receiving daptomycin 
was at least 92%. The study was not powered to test for non-inferiority for the primary or secondary 
efficacy endpoints. 
Randomisation 
Treatment assignment was based on a centralized computer-generated randomization schedule, 
stratified by age group, designed to achieve a 2:1 ratio of subjects receiving daptomycin or SOC, 
respectively.  
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
Because Principal Investigators were not blinded to study treatment, a blinded Investigator (hereafter 
referred to as blinded Evaluator) assessed all safety and efficacy endpoints. This was done in order to 
minimize bias that can be associated with subjective assessments, such as those included in this study.  
Prior to study start at each site, a physician was designated as the blinded Evaluator who remained 
blinded throughout the study period. 
Blinded Evaluator’s responsibilities: 
1.  Determined the relationship of AEs to study drug; 
2.  Assessed signs and symptoms of primary site of bacteraemia infection throughout the study, at 
the Screening/Baseline Visit, daily while on IV study medication, at the End of IV Therapy Visit, at 
the End of Oral Therapy Visit (for subjects who received oral study drug), and at the TOC/Safety 
Visit; 
3.  Decided on duration of treatment with IV study medication (whenever possible) 
a.  Decided if IV study medication should be discontinued based on subject’s clinical  
response; 
4.  Decided on switch to an oral antibiotic (whenever possible); 
5.  Determined clinical response by comparing the subject’s signs and symptoms of primary site of 
bacteraemia infection at the End of IV Therapy (EOIV) Visit, the End of Oral Therapy (for subjects 
who received oral study drug), and the TOC/Safety Visits to those recorded at Study Baseline; 
6.  Determined microbiological response by comparing the Baseline infecting pathogen (BIP) with 
results from cultures after initiation of study drug. 
Statistical methods 
Clinical data on safety were described and analysed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) System. 
Data were pooled across study centres, and presented and tabulated by treatment and age group. 
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables were presented by treatment group and included number of 
subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables were 
summarized by group and included the number and percentage of subjects in each category and 95% CIs 
were constructed around the percentage, when appropriate. A 95% CI was constructed around the 
difference between treatment groups in the rate of key safety and clinical outcomes. Descriptive statistics 
were used to guide decisions as to the clinical relevance of findings. No formal hypothesis tests were 
planned.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was conducted initially in paediatric patients between the ages of > 4 and 17 years. 
Following review of safety data by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), the protocol was 
sequentially amended to allow enrolment of paediatric subjects down to 1 year of age. 
Baseline data 
All subjects included in the Safety Population had Gram-positive, aerobic blood culture results at baseline. 
The majority of subjects was enrolled in the study based on Gram stain and conventional culture. Overall, 
73 subjects had proven SAB at baseline (included in the mMITT Population), including 51/55 (92.7%) 
daptomycin-treated subjects and 22/26 (84.6%) comparator-treated subjects. The percentage of MSSA 
and MRSA infections were similar between treatment arms, with MSSA as the baseline pathogen in the 
majority of subjects: MSSA infections in 80.0% (44/55) of the daptomycin arm and 73.1% (19/26) of the 
comparator arm, MSRA infections in 12.7% (7/55) of the daptomycin arm and 11.5% (3/26) of the 
comparator arm. 
Overall, a similar number of subjects were enrolled in each of the age groups, and, in general, the 2 
treatment arms, age groups, and analysis populations were comparable. The majority of subjects were 
White (75.3%), the mean age was 8.7 years (range 2.0 to 17.6 years), and there was a higher 
distribution of male (66.7%) than female subjects in the study. Younger children and toddlers (1 to 6 
years of age) comprised 39.5% of the Safety Population. Older children (7 to 11 years of age) and 
adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) were also well-represented in the study population overall, with 
34.6% (28/81) and 25.9% (21/81) of subjects included in these age groups, respectively. No subjects 1 
year of age were enrolled in this study despite enrolment being open to this age group.

Table 2.7.3-pedbac: 5 (cont.): Summary of Primary Diagnosis and Disease History (Safety Population - 
Paediatric Phase 4 SAB Study [DAP- PEDBAC-11-02])  
Despite that conversion to oral treatment was discouraged a large proportion of the study subjects 
converted to oral study medication. All subjects included in the Safety Population had Gram-positive, 
aerobic blood culture results at baseline. The majority of subjects were enrolled in the study based on 
Gram stain and conventional culture. Overall, 73 subjects had proven SAB at baseline (included in the 
mMITT Population), including 51/55 (92.7%) daptomycin-treated subjects and 22/26 (84.6%) 
comparator-treated subjects. The percentage of MSSA and MRSA infections were similar between 
treatment arms, with MSSA as the baseline pathogen in the majority of subjects: MSSA infections in 
80.0% (44/55) of the daptomycin arm and 73.1% (19/26) of the comparator arm, MSRA infections in 
12.7% (7/55) of the daptomycin arm and 11.5% (3/26) of the comparator arm. The percentage of 
patients with complicated and uncomplicated bacteraemia was nearly similar in the daptomycin group 
(45.5% vs. 49.1%) while in the comparator group nearly twice as many patients had complicated 
bacteraemia (61.5% vs. 30.8% with uncomplicated). However, the number of patients in the comparator 
group is overall limited.  
Outcomes and estimation 
In study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 most subjects in both treatment groups received ≤3 weeks of IV therapy. 
The mean duration of IV treatment was similar in the 2 treatment groups (12.2 days in daptomycin- and 
12.3 days in comparator-treated subjects). The mean duration of oral treatment was 22.7 days in 
daptomycin- and 17.7 days in comparator-treated subjects. 
The summary of results for the mMITT population by treatment arm and age group is shown in table 2.5:5 
below. Overall, the proportion of daptomycin-treated subjects with a favourable clinical response at the 
 
 
 
 
TOC/Safety Visit in the mMITT Population was 88.2% in the daptomycin arm and 77.3% in the 
comparator arm. Clinical success rates at the TOC/Safety Visit were also generally similar across age 
groups for the 2 treatment arms. 
In mMITT, CE, and MITT populations, the clinical success rates were generally comparable between the 
daptomycin- and comparator-treated arms.

Clinical outcome was also evaluated by S. aureus organism at baseline (MSSA versus MRSA), type of 
bacteraemia (complicated versus uncomplicated), and study therapy route (IV only versus IV plus oral). 
Overall, response rates were generally similar between the 2 treatment arms across these subgroups. 
Clinical outcome results by these subgroups are presented in Table 12.

Among the 63 subjects in the mMITT Population who were infected with MSSA at baseline, the rate of 
clinical success was generally similar in the daptomycin-treated subjects at the TOC/Safety Visit (88.6% 
for daptomycin versus 78.9% for comparator). Among the 40 subjects with complicated bacteraemia in 
the mMITT Population, the clinical success rate was generally similar in the 2 treatment arms at the 
TOC/Safety Visit (88.5% for daptomycin versus 71.4% for comparator). As expected, subjects who 
received both IV and oral study therapy fared better than those receiving IV study therapy only, as 
subjects were predominantly switched to oral therapy after clinical improvement with IV study therapy 
had already been documented. 
Microbiological success rates at the TOC/Safety Visit for the mMITT Population were similar in the 
daptomycin (76.5%) and comparator (77.3%) treatment arms (data not shown). The analyses of the CE 
and MITT Populations gave similar results to those shown for the mMITT Population. Subjects in the 
youngest (1- to 6-year old) age group had similar microbiological response in the 2 treatment groups 
(90.0% [18/20] daptomycin-treated subjects versus 87.5% [7/8] comparator-treated subjects). In the 
middle (7 to 11 years of age) age group, daptomycin treated subjects had a higher rate of microbiological 
success (82.4% [14/17]) than comparator-treated subjects (55.6% [5/9]). In contrast, among the oldest 
age group (12 to 17 years of age) subjects, higher microbiological responses were seen in the comparator 
group (100% [5/5]) versus the daptomycin group (50.0% [7/14]). However, the results by age group 
should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes. 
Time to clearance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The median times to clearance were 2.5 
and 2.0 days in the daptomycin and comparator groups, respectively. For those subjects with infections 
caused by MSSA (38 subjects in the daptomycin arm and 16 subjects in the comparator arm), the median 
times to clearance were 3.0 and 2.5 days, respectively. For subjects with infections caused by MRSA (6 in 
daptomycin group and 3 in comparator group), the median times to clearance were 2.0 and 1.0 days, 
respectively (subjects who achieved clearance prior to Day 1 were not included in the time to clearance 
analysis). No significant difference between the treatment groups for time to clearance was observed in 
the mMITT Population, either overall or for the subset of subjects with MSSA infection or MRSA infection. 
When the same analysis was done by age group, no significant differences were observed between 
treatment arms. 
Results for a favourable overall outcome, defined as both a favourable clinical and microbial outcome are 
summarised in Table 13

Clinical outcome and microbiological outcome by type of primary infection: 
The clinical outcome (clinical success vs. clinical non-success [failure or non-evaluable]) and 
microbiological outcome (microbiological success vs. microbiological non-success [failure or 
non-evaluable]) by category of primary infection are shown in Table 14 and Table 15, respectively. 
For each of the 5 categories of primary infection, the proportion of subjects with a favourable clinical 
outcome (i.e., clinical success) was similar between the two treatment groups (Table 14). Moreover, for 
each of the 5 categories of primary infection, the proportion of subjects with a favourable microbiological 
outcome (i.e., microbiological success) was similar between the two treatment groups (Table 15). 
Lastly, in each treatment group, the proportion of subjects with favourable “clinical and microbiological 
outcome” were similar across the infection categories. These results are presented and interpreted with 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the understanding that such results are in the context of small numbers of subjects in the infection 
categories.  
Similar clinical outcome results were observed at the end of IV therapy time-point. Microbiological 
outcomes were not measured at the end of IV therapy in the study.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 is an open label (Evaluator-blinded), comparative, multi-centre, 
multi-national study designed to describe the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) daptomycin versus 
standard of care (SOC) in paediatric subjects aged 1 to 17 years with S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB). All 
enrolled patients had either proven or probable SAB.  
The primary end-point for study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was safety. For efficacy there were two secondary 
end-points for efficacy. One was the clinical outcome (“cure” or “improved”) based on the blinded 
Evaluator’s assessment at the TOC/Safety Visit (primarily in the mMITT population). The second 
secondary efficacy endpoint was the overall outcome based on the subject’s microbiological response and 
clinical outcome at the TOC/Safety Visit in the mMITT population.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The baseline data show that the patient population of the daptomycin and comparator groups were 
comparable. The distribution of study participants in the age cohorts were relatively similar with a slightly 
higher proportion in the lower age group (total number for both study groups): 39.5% in the 1-6 y of age 
group, 34.6% in the 7-11 y of age group and 25.9% in the 12-17 y of age group.  
The MAH distributed test medicine to 65 sites around the world, but only 25 sites provided data. There is 
not information on the number of subjects screened for enrolment. 
The enrolled population is heterogeneous with regard to primary infection, and only a limited number of 
enrolled patients seem to belong to the cSSTI category.  
In the mMITT population at TOC clinical success were obtained in 45 (88.2%) in the daptomycin group 
and 17 (77.3%) in the comparator group. The majority were defined as “cured” in both treatment groups. 
The data on at end of IV treatment (EOIV), 48 (91. 4%) patients in the daptomycin group were 
categorised as clinical success, defined as “cure” or “improved”. Of these 14 (27.4%) were cured. In the 
comparator group 19 (95%) patients obtained clinical success of which only four (18.2%) patients 
defined as cured. The efficacy at TOC/safety visit in the mMITT population is based on variable duration 
of daptomycin treatment, as well as, different subsequent oral treatments. In addition, the comparator is 
very heterogeneous, consisting of various antibiotics. Hence, the results are difficult to interpret.  
Of the 55 patients randomised and treated, 47 (85.5%) and 23 (88.5%) completed the IV/oral treatment 
in the daptomycin and comparator arm, respectively. The switch to oral treatment was discouraged in the 
protocol. Despite this, 32 patients (58.2%) in the daptomycin arm and 16 patients (61.5%) in the 
comparator arm converted to oral treatment. All of the 32 in the daptomycin arm converting to oral 
treatment completed the oral study medication, whereas two of the 16 in the comparator arm 
discontinued the oral treatment medication due to adverse events. It is acknowledged that a switch to 
oral therapy was only acceptable if clinical improvement to IV treatment had already been documented. 
Still it is a prerequisite that the outcome at end of i.v. treatment can be assessed by objective endpoints 
and that the EOIV outcome is convincing. An early switch to oral therapy can always be questioned since 
it may be difficult to attribute efficacy to the i.v. drug therapy before switching to oral therapy.  
In the daptomycin group, the proportion of subjects with microbiological success following treatment with 
≤14 days of IV antibiotics was slightly higher than that for subjects treated with >14 days of IV antibiotics 
(79.4% vs. 70.6%, respectively). A similar trend based on the duration of IV antibiotics was observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/683418/2017 
Page 37/51 
 
  
  
 
the comparator group (≤14 days of IV antibiotics: 78.6%; >14 days of IV antibiotics: 75.0%). Across 
treatment groups, the proportion of subjects with microbiological success was similar regardless of the 
duration of IV antibiotics (≤14 days or >14 days). 
The mean treatment duration for the daptomycin and comparator group (safety population) was 12.3 and 
12.2 days, respectively. It is noted that the treatment duration range was 1-44 days and the majority of 
patients (approx. 85%) have been treated with daptomycin for less than 3 weeks. Also, it is noted that the 
current duration of treatment of cSSTI in the paediatric patients is 14 days. The MAH was therefore asked 
to justify the proposed duration of treatment of up to 42 days as proposed in the SmPC in for the 
paediatric patients with SAB associated with cSSTI. In its response, the MAH asserted that some clinical 
guidelines recommend treatment for SAB for up to 42 days, usually 4-6 weeks. As exposure up to 6 weeks 
has not been studied, this is still considered a limitation. Hence, in line with the recommendation for 
adults with SAB the posology section was revised, emphasizing that the duration of therapy may need to 
be longer than 14 days in accordance with the perceived risk of complications in the individual patient. 
Additional expert consultation 
Not applicable 
Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy (and safety) data with daptomycin did not reveal a difference between those treated for < 
than or > than 14 days 
In addition, the MAH presented the outcome (i.e. clinical success and microbiologic success) at end of IV 
treatment (EOIV) and at TOC by primary infection site and by treatment duration. The analysis is 
restricted by the small number of patients, particularly for different subsets. This is further complicated by 
the heterogeneity in the terms used for diagnosis. Based on the available data though, the clinical and 
microbiologic outcome at EOIV and at TOC (mMITT population) by type of primary infection and by 
duration of daptomycin treatment appears to be similar. 
No exposure up to 42 days has not been studied and CHMP recommends to align the duration of treatment 
for SAB with cSSTI in paediatric population with the duration stated in the Product Information for the 
corresponding indication in adults. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety profile of daptomycin in the currently approved indication: 
The clinical study reports (CSRs) were submitted to European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the context of 
FUM 007 (Study DAPPEDS-05-01 – January 2007; Study DAP-PEDS-07-02 – July2009; Study 
DAP-PEDS-09-01 – September2012 and Study DAP-PEDS-07-03 - March2015). 
Most adverse events (AEs) in the above mentioned studies were characterized as mild or moderate in 
intensity and were not attributed to daptomycin by either the sponsor or investigator. Overall, the most 
frequently reported AEs were in the following system organ classes (SOCs): gastrointestinal disorders, 
Assessment report  
EMA/683418/2017 
Page 38/51 
 
  
  
 
 
investigations and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was 
reported as an AE more frequently in patients treated with daptomycin than in patients receiving placebo 
or comparator antibiotics. 
Cumulatively, for both adults and paediatric populations, the three most frequently reported serious 
adverse events (SAEs) in clinical trials were from the following the SOCs: infections and infestations, 
followed by cardiac disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.  
Serious and non-serious adverse events from post-marketing sources were most frequently reported 
from the following SOCs: investigations, general disorders and administration site conditions, and 
infections and infestations. 
Study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 
Patient exposure 
Eighty-one of the 82 subjects (98.8%) received study drug. Therefore, the Safety Population included 81 
subjects, including 55 daptomycin-treated subjects and 26 comparator-treated subjects. Daptomycin 
was generally well tolerated when administered to paediatric subjects (1 to 17 years of age) with SAB at 
doses of 7 to 12 mg/kg once daily for up to 6 weeks. 
Adverse events 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was 65.5% and 76.9% subjects in the daptomycin and comparator arm 
respectively. Treatment related TEAEs were noted in 14.5% and 15.4% of subjects in the daptomycin and 
comparator arm, respectively. The safety profile was comparable across age groups and similar to the 
comparator. The type, incidence, and severity of TEAEs reported for daptomycin and comparator were 
comparable. 
In the study overall, reported TEAEs were mostly mild (20 subjects, 24.7%) or moderate (27 subjects, 
33.3%) in intensity. Five (9.1%) daptomycin-treated subjects and 4 (15.4%) comparator-treated 
subjects reported events, which were considered severe in intensity. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in similar proportions of subjects in the treatment groups (8 
[14.5%] daptomycin-treated and 4 [15.4%] comparator-treated subjects) (see table 2.5:10). Three 
(5.5%) daptomycin-treated and 2 (7.7%) comparator-treated subjects discontinued study drug due to a 
TEAE.

Most TEAEs were not considered to be related to study drug by the blinded Evaluator for either treatment 
group (Table 16). In general, the proportion of subjects with one or more treatment-related TEAE was 
similar in the two treatment groups with 8 (14.5%) subjects in the daptomycin group and 4 (15.4%) 
subjects in the comparator group experienced TEAEs considered related to the study drug by the blinded 
Evaluator. 
The most common AEs in the daptomycin treatment arm were diarrhoea (6 subjects, 19.9%), vomiting (6 
subjects, 10,9%) and pyrexia (5 subjects, 9.1%) (Table 17).  
The most common AEs reported in the comparator arm were diarrhoea (5 subjects, 19.2%), followed by 
osteomyelitis (4 subjects, 15.4%), pyrexia (3 subjects, 11.5%), and arthritis bacterial (3 subjects, 
11.5%).

AE: adverse event; COM: standard of care comparator; DAP: daptomycin; TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event 
Overall, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Nine subjects had TEAEs that were 
considered to be severe (11.1%), including 5 (9.1%) daptomycin-treated subjects and 4 (15.4%) 
comparator-treated subjects (Table 2.5: 10). Eight of these 9 subjects had severe events also reported as 
SAEs. None of the severe events were considered to be treatment-related, and 2 of these events 
(pneumonia and osteomyelitis) led to study drug discontinuation. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidence of SAEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups, and there were no drug-related SAEs or 
deaths. A total of 20 subjects, including 13 subjects who received daptomycin (23.6%) and 7 subjects 
who received comparator (26.9%), experienced at least 1 SAE (Table 19).

TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event 
Notes: Adverse events (AEs) are coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 17.1. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are AEs occurring with an onset date on or after the first administration of 
study drug (including Day 1) through the last study evaluation. Subjects experiencing more than one AE with the same system organ 
class and preferred term are counted only once at the corresponding system organ class or preferred term level. 
SAEs belonging to the infections and Infestations system organ class was the most commonly reported. 
Overall, 12 SAEs which occurred in 10 subjects belonged to the infections and Infestations SOC. Eight 
SAEs that were infections occurred in 7 daptomycin-treated subjects (12.7%), and 4 SAEs that were 
infections occurred in 3 comparator-treated subjects (11.5%). Events in this system organ class included 
bacteraemia (4 subjects, with 1 reported as Staphylococcal bacteraemia) in the daptomycin arm and 
bacterial arthritis (2 subjects) in the comparator arm. Two subjects in each arm discontinued due to a 
TEAE that was also a SAE, as follows. 
The MAH justified the proposed treatment duration also in light of safety in the youngest age group 1-6 
year of age for which the highest dosing is proposed, based on PK modelling. 
Thus, the safety data obtained from this study and the integrated safety analysis can be considered valid 
for this lower age group.

Integrated safety Evaluation across two paediatric studies (DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 and DAP-PEDS-07-03): 
The safety population included 311 daptomycin and 159 comparator-treated paediatric subjects. The 
overall incidence of TEAEs was 43.1% in daptomycin-treated and 42.8% in comparator-treated subjects. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were noted in 13.8% of daptomycin- and 16.4% of comparator-treated 
subjects. The safety profile for daptomycin was comparable in the various age groups and was similar to 
the comparator. The type, incidence, and severity of TEAEs reported for daptomycin were comparable to 
those reported for comparator.

Source-Clinical data from studies: DAP-PEDS-07-03 and DAP-PEDBAC-11-02. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug 
were reported in similar proportions of subjects in the treatment arms, including 43 (13.8%) 
daptomycin-treated subjects and 26 (16.4%) comparator-treated subjects (Table 2.5:13). Ten (3.2%) 
daptomycin-treated subjects and 9 (5.7%) comparator-treated subjects discontinued study drug due to 
a TEAE (Table 2.5: 13). 
The incidence of SAEs was similar in the two treatment arms (6.1% in daptomycin-treated subjects and 
6.3% in comparator-treated subjects) (Table 2.5: 13). Altogether, there was 1 study drug-related SAE 
and there were no deaths.  
In the combined Safety Populations of the two Phase 4 paediatric (SAB and cSSSI) studies, the 3 most 
common adverse events (preferred terms) in daptomycin-treated subjects were diarrhoea (24 subjects, 
7.7%), blood CPK increased (18 subjects, 5.8%), and pyrexia (14 subjects, 4.5%). The incidences 
reported for these adverse events were similar in the comparator arm, as follows: diarrhoea (12 subjects,

7.5%), blood CPK increased (7 subjects, 4.4%), and pyrexia (7 subjects, 4.4%). In general, these 
adverse events were expected events when antibiotic treatments are administered to paediatric subjects 
with cSSSI or SAB. 
Integrated safety Evaluation 
Integrated safety Evaluation across two paediatric studies (DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 and DAP-PEDS-07-03, 
DAP-PEDS-05-01, DAP-PEDS-07-02, and DAP-PEDS-09-01): 
The combined Safety Populations in these studies included 372 daptomycin-treated subjects. 
Overall, 42.2% of daptomycin-treated subjects reported a TEAE. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported 
for 13.2% of subjects and 3.0% (11/372) subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. Overall, 5.6% 
(21/372) of subjects experienced a SAE, 1 (0.3%) subject experienced a drug-related SAE, and there 
were no deaths. The safety profile was generally comparable across age groups. 
The most common AEs among daptomycin-treated paediatric subjects in the 5 completed studies were: 
diarrhea (27 subjects, 7.3%), blood CPK increased (21 subjects, 5.6%), and pyrexia (17 subjects, 4.6%). 
There were no reports of drug hypersensitivity, eosinophilic pneumonia, dysregulation of in vivo 
coagulation, serious hepatotoxicity, or bone marrow toxicity among the adverse events reported. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Integrated data from all the paediatric studies are reassuring and raise no new safety issues for 
daptomycin. The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs in the daptomycin treatment arm 
were diarrhea and blood CPK increased, which are well known adverse drug reactions already reported in 
the label for daptomycin.  
However, safety data from patients <2 year of age were lacking. This was flagged as a concern as the 
proposed dose for the SAB indication is higher compared to the paediatric cSSTI indication. The MAH 
discussed the appropriateness of the proposed lower age cut-off of one year. The obtained PK data 
demonstrate that daptomycin exposure and safety data (based on CPK data) in patients 2 to 17 years of 
age is similar to the exposure seen in adults receiving the 6 mg/kg dose. Further on, the appropriateness 
of the recommended 12 mg/kg daptomycin administered as 60-minute infusion for paediatric SAB 
patients, 1 to <2 years is supported from PK/exposure considerations and safety considerations, 
including CPK elevations. 
In addition, the MAH justified the proposed treatment duration in light of safety. In the context of limited 
clinical data/study subpopulation, there is no obvious increased risk for specific TEAEs in subjects 
receiving >14 days of daptomycin as compared to those receiving >14 days of comparator IV antibiotics.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The MAH justified the proposed treatment duration, also in light of safety in the youngest age group 1-6 
year of age for which the highest dosing is proposed.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. 
For details refer to the Product Information adopted by the CHMP on 12 October 2017. 
Most important change, extension of indication shown hereafter: 
“Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) 
when associated with RIE or with cSSTI. In adults, use in bacteraemia should be associated with 
RIE or with cSSTI, while in paediatric patients, use in bacteraemia should be associated with 
cSSTI.” 
The full indications for Cubicin will be as follows: 
“Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
•  Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections 
(cSSTI). 
Assessment report  
EMA/683418/2017 
Page 47/51 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is 
recommended that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial 
susceptibility of the organism and should be based on expert advice. See sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
•  Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). 
In adults, use in bacteraemia should be associated with RIE or with cSSTI, while in paediatric patients, 
use in bacteraemia should be associated with cSSTI.” 
In addition, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the product 
information in line with the latest QRD template version 10 and to combine the SmPCs for both strengths 
(350 and 500 mg). The MAH also updated the RMP, from last approved version 9.1 to the current version 
10.1. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed, nor required.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Infections due to resistant Gram-positive bacteria are increasingly common in paediatric patients. Serious 
infections due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular, 
are a major health problem worldwide.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Few antibiotics with activity against MRSA or other serious Gram-positive bacteria are currently available, 
and fewer still have had their safety and efficacy carefully evaluated in paediatric patients. 
Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent, shows rapid in vitro bactericidal activity with 
concentration-dependent killing for Gram-positive organisms, such as MRSA and methicillin-susceptible 
S. aureus (MSSA). 
Clinical trials in adults demonstrated that daptomycin was safe and efficacious in complicated skin and 
skin structure infections (cSSSI) and bloodstream infections (bacteraemia) caused by S. aureus, 
including right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE). Additionally, in a recently completed clinical trial 
(DAP-PEDS-07-03), daptomycin was shown to be safe and well tolerated in paediatric subjects (ages 1 to 
17 years) with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens and was similarly effective as standard of care 
(SOC) therapy. 
The purpose of this submission is to support the efficacy and safety of daptomycin in the treatment of S. 
aureus bacteraemia (SAB) in paediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age).

3.1.3.  Main clinical study 
A prospective, 2:1 randomized paediatric Phase 4 study ([DAP-PEDBAC-11-02] was performed, wherein 
the safety, efficacy, and PK of age-specific, weight-based dosing of intravenous (IV) daptomycin was 
specifically evaluated in 82 paediatric subjects with SAB, including 55 subjects who received daptomycin. 
Comparators included intravenously administered medications as follows: vancomycin, clindamycin, 
semi-synthetic penicillins [nafcillin, oxacillin, or cloxacillin], or first-generation cephalosporins. 
The study in paediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years aimed to confirm the safety of daptomycin at 
exposures similar to those reported for adults treated for bacteraemia (90% of adult subjects had mean 
steady state systemic exposures [AUC] between 270 to 1151 μg*h/mL; mean AUC 622 μg*h/mL; median 
AUC 543 μg*h/mL). In paediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, children showed progressively higher 
daptomycin clearance and higher volume of distribution with decreasing age compared to that of adult 
subjects. Thus, to achieve similar exposures in children to those seen in adults, different doses (mg/kg) 
were evaluated by age groups. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the mMITT population at TOC clinical success were obtained in 45 (88.2%) in the daptomycin group 
and 17 (77.3%) in the comparator group. The majority were defined as “cured” in both treatment groups. 
At end of IV treatment (EOIV) 48 (91. 4%) patients in the daptomycin group were categorised as clinical 
success, defined as “cure” or “improved”. Of these 14 (27.4%) were cured. In the comparator group 19 
(95%) patients obtained clinical success of which only 4 (18.2%) patients were being defined as cured.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The enrolled population is heterogeneous with regard to primary infection, and only a limited number of 
enrolled patients belong to the cSSTI category. Furthermore, the efficacy at TOC/safety visit in the mMITT 
population is based on variable duration of daptomycin treatment (range 1-44 days), as well as, different 
subsequent oral treatments. Moreover, no patients below the age of two years have been included.  
The study population in each of the paediatric studies was quite small, with even smaller numbers in the 
sub groups and therefore some caution would be advisable. However the dosing regimens are supported 
by both PK modelling and clinical data, which is reassuring. There were also a high number of major 
protocol violations but these were considered not to have influenced the interpretation of the results. 
There is still a lack of data in renal impairment (flagged in SmPC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No new adverse events have been identified and the safety profile for daptomycin in children appears to 
be in line with what has been previously reported. The need for monitoring the potential increase in 
creatine phosphokinase is mentioned in the SmPC and administration in children below 1 year age is not 
recommended due to adverse effects seen in neonatal dogs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
For the proposed posology, the safety profile in patients below 2 year of age is unknown but the 
recommended 12 mg/kg daptomycin dosage administered as 60-minute infusion for paediatric SAB 
patients, 1 to <2 years is supported from PK/exposure considerations and safety considerations, 
including CPK elevations. Data for the recommended maximum treatment duration is limited and, hence, 
Assessment report  
EMA/683418/2017 
Page 49/51 
 
  
  
for the requested indication of SAB with cSSTI in paediatric population, the duration of therapy should be 
in accordance with available official recommendations.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Infections due to resistant Gram-positive bacteria are increasingly common in paediatric patients. Serious 
infections due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in particular, 
are a major health problem worldwide. Few antibiotics with activity against MRSA or other serious 
Gram-positive bacteria are currently available, and fewer still have had their safety and efficacy carefully 
evaluated in paediatric patients. Hence, there is an undisputable medical need for further treatment 
options for the paediatric patient population. 
The submitted documentation offers very limited data on the clinical efficacy for the applied indication 
(SAB in association with cSSTI). Due to uncertainties of the main study, the interpretation of the results 
is somewhat hampered. Although study DAP-PEDBAC-11-02 was not powered to demonstrate efficacy in 
the applied indication, exposure (AUC) matching with adults was demonstrated for all age groups. 
Consequently, the efficacy previously shown for treatment of SAB in adults can be extrapolated to the 
paediatric population based on PK data.  
No new adverse events of concern have been identified. The safety data from the paediatric patients in 
this study were consistent with the known safety profile of daptomycin.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
These data support an extension to the approved prescribing information for Cubicin to include paediatric 
(1 to 17 years of age) patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB). In paediatric patients, use 
in bacteraemia should be associated with cSSTI. 
In line with requirements outlined in the guidance document on environmental risk assessment 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), a Phase II environmental risk assessment (ERA) should be 
submitted as a post authorisation measure (REC) by end of March 2019. 
4.  Recommendations

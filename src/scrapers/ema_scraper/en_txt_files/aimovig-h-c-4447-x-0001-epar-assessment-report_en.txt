2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Migraines are headaches that can involve significant pain and may be preceded by sensory warning 
symptoms or signs (auras).  Migraine is seen as a spectrum disorder, although it has been arbitrarily 
classified as either episodic migraine (EM), characterized by fewer than 15 headache days per month, or 
chronic migraine (CM), characterized by 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 days being 
migraine days (International Classification of Headache Disorders [ICHD 3], 2013). 
Erenumab (also named Erenumab-aooe, Aimovig, AMG 334) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds 
to the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor. The CGRP receptor is located at sites that are 
relevant to migraine pathophysiology, such as the trigeminal ganglion. Erenumab potently and 
specifically competes with the binding of CGRP and inhibits its function at the CGRP receptor, and has no 
significant activity against other calcitonin family of receptors. 
About the product 
Erenumab-aooe (Erenumab/AMG 334) is indicated for the preventative treatment of migraine in adults 
with 2 dose options of 70 mg and 140 mg monthly (every 4 weeks), delivered subcutaneously (SC) as 
either 1 or 2 injections, respectively, of 70 mg/mL autoinjector pen (AI/pen) or prefilled syringe (PFS). 
The 140 mg dose administered as two 1 mL injections of 70 mg/mL in the 2 pivotal migraine studies were 
included in the original submission (Studies 20120295 and 20120296). 
The proposed commercial formulation is AI/pen or PFS with 1-mL injection of 140 mg/mL which supports 
one subcutaneous injection of 1ml for the 140mg dose in addition to two subcutaneous injections of 1ml 
70-mg/mL (AI/pen or PFS) for140 mg dose or single injection of 1ml 70-mg/mL (AI/pen or PFS) for 70 mg 
dose treatment. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a line extension to register an addition of a new strength of 140 mg, to Aimovig 
70 mg for which marketing authorisation was obtained in July 2018.  
The new solution for injection will be presented in both a pre-filled syringe and a prefilled pen: 
- 
- 
Aimovig 140mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
Aimovig 140mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The new strength, Aimovig 140mg solution for injection, is also an aqueous solution for subcutaneous 
injection with same pharmaceutical excipients as the approved product, Aimovig 70 mg solution for 
injection. 
Two type IB variations to reflect the data for drug substance manufacturing site transfer will be submitted 
for 70 mg/ml strength during the review period of this line extension procedure and for 140 mg/ml 
strength after approval of the line extension. 
The development program regard for new 140mg strength has been informed by regulatory interactions 
during the discussion with United States FDA, the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency (MPA) and the 
French National Agency for the Safety of Medicine and Health Products (ANSM).

During the pre-submission meeting on Feb 2017 with the MPA (Rapporteur) and the ANSM 
(co-Rapporteur) for the EU MAA of Aimovig, the proposed bioequivalence study design (study 20140477 
synopsis) to support the registration of the 140 mg/mL formulation was agreed. In line with this 
agreement, study 20160349 was conducted. The evaluation of the local tolerability with this new 
formulation as part of this bioequivalence study were also discussed and agreed that additional local 
tolerability testing will not be required since the local injection site tolerability has been evaluated in a 
phase I study (20150149) in which a 140 mg/mL formulation (PFS) was compared against a single 2 mL 
syringe injection and two 1 mL injections (PFS) of the 70 mg/mL formulation.  
Study 20160442 was initiated at risk prior to knowing regulatory bioequivalence requirements. The study 
was terminated before planned study completion following United States FDA confirmation that this study 
was not required to support registration of the erenumab-aooe 140-mg/mL PFS or AI/pen drug product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Novartis submitted an application for extension of marketing authorisation for the addition of a new 
finished product presentation. The currently approved commercial presentations for the erenumab 
finished product include a pre-filled syringe (PFS) and pre-filled auto-injector/pen (AI/Pen) containing a 1 
mL deliverable volume of 70 mg/mL erenumab solution for subcutaneous injection. The purpose of this 
application is to add a new finished product presentation as a 140 mg/mL PFS or AI/Pen supplied as a 
sterile, single-use, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous  injection.  
The qualitative composition in excipients in the proposed 140 mg/mL presentation remains unchanged: 
sucrose, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), glacial acetic acid and water for 
injections. 
The 140 mg/mL was developed to reduce the number of injections required from two injections to a single 
injection for a 140 mg dose. 
The nature and contents of the container for 70 mg/mL and 140 mg/mL is as follows: 
• 
Pre-filled syringe: 
Aimovig is supplied in a pre-filled syringe (1 ml, Type 1 glass) with a stainless steel needle and a needle 
cover (rubber containing latex). Aimovig is available in packs containing 1 pre-filled syringe. 
• 
Pre-filled pen: 
Aimovig is supplied in a pre-filled pen (1 ml, Type 1 glass) with a stainless steel needle and a needle cover 
(rubber containing latex). 
Aimovig is available in packs containing 1 pre-filled pen and in multipacks containing 3 (3x1) pre-filled 
pens. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Erenumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) antibody expressed in a Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cell line. Erenumab specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the calcitonin 
gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) and prevents its interaction with the neuropeptide CGRP. 
Module 3.2.S remains unchanged compared to the initial erenumab marketing authorisation application 
for the 70 mg/mL presentation (EMEA/H/C/4447, EU/1/18/1293/001-003). 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is supplied as a sterile, single-use, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous 
injection in either a PFS or a pre-filled AI/Pen. The AI/Pen is a disposable, handheld, mechanical (spring 
-based) delivery device that is provided ready-to-use, pre-assembled with the PFS. The primary container 
closure system for the PFS and AI/Pen is the same, except the PFS uses a regular wall (RW) needle and 
the AI/Pen uses a special thin wall (STW) needle. 
The quantitative and qualitative composition of the finished product is provided. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product contains a target concentration of 140 mg/mL erenumab, formulated in an aqueous 
solution with acetate, sucrose and polysorbate 80, pH 5.2. 
The applicant has previously developed an Aimovig finished product formulation which contains a 70 mg 
presentation (70 mg/ml) for subcutaneous administration in either a pre-filled syringe (PFS) or a 
pre-filled pen/auto-injector (AI) (EMEA/H/C/4447). This line extension application concerns a 140 mg 
presentation (140 mg/ml) of Aimovig including both PFS and pen/AI. The 140 mg presentation includes 
the same excipients as the 70 mg presentation but with slightly different quantities. 
Formulation development 
The 140 mg/mL formulation was designed to support the target product profile, focusing on development 
of a liquid formulation with a high protein concentration, stable at 2°C to 8°C, and compatible with 
injection. 
A formulation robustness study has been conducted to investigate the relationship between several 
formulation variables and finished product stability. The data presented demonstrate robustness of the 
140 mg/ml finished product formulation with an acceptable stability. The section on formulation 
development describes and justifies the chosen formulation and is sufficiently comprehensive. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial manufacturing process of erenumab finished product has been characterised through 
development studies. Process characterization studies have been performed for all process steps from 
active substance thaw to filling and stoppering. Process characterization details have been provided. The 
process characterization studies demonstrated that the finished product process is robust and can deliver 
the required product quality and process consistency when manufacturing is conducted within the 
prescribed operating ranges. The section on manufacturing process development has been sufficiently 
described and justifies the commercial manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199629/2019  
Page 8/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Product comparability 
Comparability was performed in accordance with ICH Q5E and has been sufficiently demonstrated in the 
comparison of 140 mg/mL pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen/AI finished product with 70 mg/ml finished 
product manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site.  
This is found acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The development of the container closure system is sufficiently presented and demonstrated safety and 
suitability for use to deliver the erenumab 140 mg/ml finished product. Detailed information has been 
provided for the primary container closure system as well as for the pre-filled pen/auto-injector (AI).  
The primary container closure consists of a 1 mL Type I glass syringe with a stainless steel staked needle 
closed with an elastomeric needle shield and a bromobutyl elastomeric plunger-stopper laminated with a 
fluoropolymer film on the product contact surface and is the same for the 140 mg/mL presentation as for 
the already approved 70 mg presentation of Aimovig (EMEA/H/C/4447). 
The erenumab 140 mg/ml pre-filled pen (auto-injector) contains a Type 1 glass pre-filled syringe (PFS). 
There is a slight difference in the auto-injector spring force required for the 140 mg/ml presentation 
compared to the already approved 70 mg/ml presentation. However, the pre-filled pen/AI for erenumab 
140 mg/ml is the same as the SureClick pre-filled pen/AI that is marketed in another centrally authorised 
medicinal product. 
Data has been presented on compatibility, Protection of Finished product Integrity, 
Performance/Functionality, Deliverable volume and hold-up volume. In addition, protection of the 
finished product by the container closure system is demonstrated by container closure integrity, stability 
of finished product and transport qualification. Protection of the finished product from light by the 
secondary packaging has also been demonstrated as well. 
All container closure components meet the appropriate specifications in the Ph. Eur.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The description of manufacturing process and process controls and control of critical steps and 
intermediates of the finished product is sufficiently described. 
Process controls 
The critical IPCs for the manufacturing process of the 140 mg/ml finished product have been presented. 
Process validation 
The manufacturing process is well described and documented. 
The validation data presented demonstrate that the process is robust and performs as intended, giving a 
finished product which meets the quality requirements when conducted within the defined ranges.  
Product specification 
Specifications include control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199629/2019  
Page 9/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The specifications are found acceptable. Batch analyses data demonstrates acceptable batch-to-batch 
consistency and reproducibility of the manufacturing process proposed for Aimovig. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were performed as per the ICH Q5C and Q1A guidelines. The acceptable shelf-life is 
24 months (2°C-8°C). The pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen should be kept in the outer carton in order 
to protect from light. After removal from the refrigerator, Aimovig must be used within 14 days when 
stored at room temperature (up to 25°C), or discarded. If it is stored at a higher temperature or for a 
longer period it must be discarded. 
Adventitious agents 
The active substance used for the 140 mg/mL presentation is the same as the active substance used for 
the already approved 70 mg/mL presentation (EMEA/H/C/4447, EU/1/18/1293/001-003). Therefore, the 
quality information in 3.2.A remains unchanged. 
This is found acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Module 3.2.S is not affected by this application. 
The dossier is of good quality. No major objections were identified. Very few issues were raised and were 
mainly related to information on the finished product manufacturing process description and validation 
data for the pre-filled pen assembly process at the commercial manufacturing site. Following the 
applicant’s responses, the issues are considered resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the extension of marketing authorisation 
for Aimovig is approvable from the quality point of view.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data was submitted in this application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Table 1 - Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Study 20160442 was terminated before planned study completion based on Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) feedback that this study was not necessary to support approval of the 140-mg 
single-injection delivery system (AI/pen or PFS). In Europe, the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) 
and the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicine and Health Products (ANSM); Rapporteur and 
co-Rapporteur for the EU MAA, respectively, agreed that Study 20160349 was appropriate on its own to 
bridge the new 140-mg/mL formulation with currently approved product presentations. Safety data for 
Study 20160442 were summarized but the PK and anti-erenumab-aooe antibody samples collected were 
not tested and analyses were not conducted.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 20160349 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel group study conducted in healthy 
volunteers to assess the bioequivalence, pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
profile of a single dose of AMG 334 administered by 1x140 mg or 2x70 mg prefilled syringe subcutaneous 
(SC) injections, administered by a healthcare provider in the abdomen. Blood samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis were taken pre-dose and up to 98 days post-dose. 
Test and reference products 
• Treatment A (test): AMG 334 140 mg (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL) prefilled syringe. 
• Treatment B (reference): AMG 334 140 mg (2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL) prefilled syringe. 
Population studied 
A total of 211 healthy male and female volunteers were enrolled and randomized to receive either the test 
or the reference product. Of these, 201 subjects completed the study. Ten subjects discontinued the 
study and the primary reason was lost to follow-up. 
Analytical methods 
AMG 334 concentration in human serum was determined using a validated ELISA method. 
Anti-AMG 334 binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies were determined according to validated 
analytical procedures. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  and statistical methods 
Standard non-compartmental methods were used. Primary endpoints were Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf. 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in order to compare PK parameters between treatments. 
Results 
The results from the comparative bioavailability study are presented below.

Immunogenicity 
Study 20160349 
Development of binding antibodies against erenumab-aooe was observed in 35 subjects (16.9%) 
post-baseline in the total erenumab-aooe group, including 16 subjects (15.8%) in the erenumab-aooe 1 
x 1 mL 140-mg/mL PFS (test) group and 19 subjects (17.9%) in the erenumab-aooe 2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL 
PFS (reference) group. Of the 35 subjects that tested positive for binding antibodies, 4 were transient (ie, 
negative result at the last time point tested). 
Neutralizing antibodies against erenumab-aooe developed in 1 subject (0.5%) after administration of 
erenumab-aooe 2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL PFS; the subject was positive for anti-erenumab-aooe neutralizing 
antibodies at the end of study visit, but reverted to neutralizing antibody negative at the 3-month 
antibody follow-up.  
No notable differences in the development of anti-erenumab-aooe antibodies between the1 x 1 mL 
140-mg/mL PFS (test) group and 2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL PFS (reference) group. The applicant claimed that 
the presence of anti-erenumab-aooe antibodies was not associated with immune disorder-related 
adverse events. 
The presence of ADA did not influence the exposure of AMG334. This is in accordance with results from 
the original application. The incidence of ADAs was 16.9% in the total erenumab 140mg treated group 
which is somewhat higher compared to that in the studies in the original MAA. It is noted that the same 
immunoassays as in the original application were used.  
Study 20160442: Blood samples were collected, but analysis of ADAs was not performed. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This line extension concerns a new strength of Aimovig, 140 mg to be administered as a single monthly 
injection. The drug product consists of a solution of injection filled in either a pre-filled syringe (PFS) or an 
autoinjector pen (AI/pen). Study 20160349, in which the bioavailability of the new 140 mg PFS was 
compared to the already approved PFS given as 2x70 mg, is pivotal for the application. 
Study 20160442 in which the bioavailability of the AI/pen was evaluated was terminated early and only 
safety results were reported. The PK samples were not analysed and thus bioequivalence not evaluated. 
The PFS and the AI/pen are both filled with the same solution for injection. It is therefore considered 
sufficient to establish bioequivalence with the PFS only. In the original application bioequivalence was 
demonstrated between the 70 mg PFS and AI/pen, which further supports that a study with the PFS is 
sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199629/2019  
Page 13/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pivotal study 20160349 and its statistical evaluation were in accordance with accepted standards for 
bioequivalence testing, as stated in the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1/Corr). The bioanalytical methods were adequately validated. The 90% 
CI of the test/reference ratio for both AUClast and Cmax was within the conventional acceptance range for 
bioequivalence, 80.00-125.00%. Hence, the new 140 mg prefilled syringe is considered bioequivalent to 
2x70 mg of the already approved prefilled syringe. 
Development of binding antibodies against erenumab-aooe and neutralizing antibodies against 
erenumab-aooe were similar between the 1 x 1 mL 140-mg/mL PFS (test) group and 2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL 
PFS (reference) group. The presence of ADA did not influence the exposure of AMG334. This is in 
accordance with results from the original application. The incidence of ADAs was 17.9% in study 
20160349 which is somewhat higher compared to that in the original application. The incidence of ADAs 
during the double-blind treatment phase of the clinical studies is 6.3% (56/884) among subjects 
receiving a 70mg dose of erenumab and 2.6% (13/504) among subjects receiving a 140mg of erenumab. 
In the day 120 AR, the applicant was asked to discuss the discrepancy of the ADA data.  
In the response, the applicant briefly discusses the causes of the discrepancy of the ADA data in clinical 
trials such as inclusion of different clinical trial scenarios, dosing regimens and ADA assessment 
schedules, arguing that the occurrence of ADAs is often associated with a substantial inter-study 
variability.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the presented comparative bioavailability study (20160349) the new 140 mg prefilled syringe 
was bioequivalent to 2x70 mg of the already approved prefilled syringe. The results of study 20160349 
can be extrapolated to the 140 mg autoinjector pen. 
The incidence of ADAs was 17.9% in study 20160349 which is somewhat higher compared to that in the 
original application. No new safety concern of immunogenicity was identified based on the ADA data 
submitted in this application.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No new clinical efficacy studies of erenumab administered as a single 140-mg/mL dose by PFS or AI/pen 
delivery system were conducted for this line extension application. The 140 mg dose administered as two 
1 mL injections of 70 mg/mL in the 2 pivotal migraine studies were included in the original submission 
(Studies 20120295 and 20120296). Since the posology for Aimovig will not be changed, a new efficacy 
study is not required. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study 20160349:  
In total, 211 subjects were enrolled in the study in which 105 subjects received 1 SC injection of 140 mg 
(ie, 1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL PFS [test] and 106 subjects received 2 SC injections of 70 mg (ie, 2 x 1 mL 70 
mg/mL PFS [reference] (Table 9-1 of Study 20160349 CSR). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199629/2019  
Page 14/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
201 of the 211 enrolled subjects (95.3%) completed the study; 10 subjects (4.7%) discontinued the 
study for the following reasons: loss to follow-up (7 subjects [3.3%]), withdrawal of consent from study 
(2 subjects [0.9%]), and decision by sponsor (1 subject [0.5%]) 
Study 20160442 (terminated early as previous described):  
In total, 104 subjecs were enrolled in the study in which 52 subjects received 1 SC injection of 140 mg (ie, 
1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL PFS [test] and 52 subjects received 2 SC injections of 70 mg (ie, 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL 
PFS [reference] (Table 14-1.1 of Study 20160442 CSR). 
60 of the 104 enrolled subjects (57.7%) completed the study and 44 subjects (42.3%) discontinued the 
study. The most frequently reported reason for study discontinuation was withdrawal of consent from 
study (41 subjects). All of these subjects withdrew consent within 1 to 2 months of study termination 
notification (these subjects were followed for a mean of 38 days [range, 22 to 68 days] after receiving 
investigational product. In addition, 3 subjects were lost to follow-up. 
For both studies, no subjects discontinued the study due to AEs. In study 20160442, the majority of the 
subjects discontinued in the study by withdrawal of consent which is likely due to early study termination. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs collected in the single dose bioequivalent studies 
20160349 and 20160442 is summarized in Table 4:

In general, treatment-emergent adverse events and the frequency of these AEs were similar across 
treatment groups in study 20160349. Among the treatment-emergent Adverse Events reported by 
Preferred Term Occurring in ≥ 2 Subjects (Study 20160349 and Study 20160442), constipation and 
injection site reactions has already been identified as ADR and is listed in SmPC 4.8. Device-related 
Adverse Events/Injection site reactions are described in the section below. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study 20160349 
No fatal adverse events were reported. Serious adverse events were reported by 3 subjects (1.4%), 
including 2 subjects (1.9%) in the 1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL PFS (test) group and 1 subject (0.9%) in the 2 x 
1 mL 70 mg/mL PFS (reference) group.  These events are further discussed below.

Set)
Serious adverse event (DILI): 
A case of drug-induced liver injury concerning a 51 year old Hispanic female was reported from study 
20160349. In brief, 10 days after single administration of AMG334 (1x1 140 mg/mL), the subject was 
noted to have elevated liver tests with AST 1713 U/L, ALT 1626 U/L, total bilirubin (TBL) 1.3 mg/dL and 
direct bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL. At day 12, repeat liver function tests were AST 2065 U/L, ALT 6025 U/L, TBL 
4.9 mg/dL and direct bilirubin 3.1 mg/dL. The subject reported nausea and decreased appetite and was 
hospitalized for elevated liver tests and discharged 4 days later by which time liver test results were 
decreasing: AST 162 U/L, ALT 1528 U/L, TBL 3.3 mg/d, direct bilirubin 2.24 mg/dL. The liver tests 
returned to normal on study day 43. Medical history included cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy and a 
positive urine screen for benzodiazepines. Additional laboratory testing showed a normal hepatitis panel, 
furthermore, an EBV panel performed on study day 29 was suggestive of a past EBV infection. The subject 
did not meet the criteria for Hy’s Law. 
This event was initially reported as an SAE  of acute liver failure and later was updated by the investigator 
to drug induced liver injury due to investigator’s concern related to concomitant medications (namely 
Augmentin, taken for 10 days, approximately 6 weeks prior to liver enzyme elevations;the subject had 
also taken chlordiazepoxide). The investigator’s final causality assessment was not related to AMG 334. 
The subject completed the study.  
Based on the review of the information provided for this case report, a conclusive causality assessment 
could not be established due to multiple confounding factors.  
Other SAEs 
In addition, two serious adverse events from study 20160349 were reported which included a 35 year old 
male experienced left side hearing loss and laceration left axilla after a motor vehicle accident while 
driving. The events resolved after treatment. The investigator considered the SAEs was not related to 
both AMG 334 and the device and the subject completed the study. One subject,  a 24 year old male 
experienced left hand septic arthritis, metacarpophalangeal joint and cellulitis following an infection 
secondary to a spider bite. The events resolved after treatment. The investigator considered the SAEs was 
not related to both AMG 334 and the device and the subject completed the study.

Laboratory findings 
Data from serum chemistry, haematology laboratory values in general were consistent with the original 
marketing application dossier. The subject with abnormal lab values at or above CTCAE grade 3 and one 
SAE were reviewed in detail: 
Study 20160349 (N= 211 subjects):  
A total of 7 subjects had laboratory values at or above CTCAE grade 3, one of which occurred during 
screening.  
Six subjects following erenumab treatment include: 2 subjects with creatine kinase elevation (Grade 4,), 
1 subject with creatine kinase elevation + decrease in magnesium (Grade 4,) and 1 subject with decrease 
in neutrophils (Grade 3) in the 1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL PFS (test) group; 1 subject (Subject 34966007090, 
see SAE section) reported as drug-induced liver injury in the 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL PFS (reference) group. 
One additional subject in study 20160349 had transient AST (Grade 1, <2ULN) and ALT (<3 ULN) 
increase at day 10-day 23 after erenumab 140 mg treatment, the subject had evaluated ALT (<2 ULN) at 
baseline. Very limited information was provided. 
Study 20160442 (N=104 subjects):  
A total of 4 subjects had laboratory values at or above CTCAE grade 3 ,4 subjects including sodium 
elevation (Grade 3, 1 subject) and elevation in creatine kinase (grade 3, 1 subject) in the erenumab 1 x 
1 mL 140 mg/mL AI/pen (test) group; magnesium elevation(Grade 3, 1 subject) and elevation in creatine 
kinase (Grade 4, 1 subject) in the erenumab 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL AI/pen (reference) group. 
Vital signs 
Based on the review of the Vital signs data for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart and respiratory 
rates, and temperature provided in the CSR, no new safety concerns were identified. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Device-related Adverse Events/Injection site reactions 
Device-related treatment-emergent adverse events defined as any adverse event related to the use of a 
medical device were reviewed and discussed by the applicant. 
Study 20160349 
Adverse events mapping to the injection site reaction Amgen Medical Query (AMQ) occurred in 5 subjects 
(2.4%) including 3 subjects (2.9%) in the erenumab 1 x 1 mL 140-mg/mL PFS (test) group and 2 subjects 
(1.9%) in the erenumab 2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL PFS (reference) group. Injection site reaction events 
included injection site hemorrhage, injection site pain (2 subjects [0.9%] each); and injection site 
swelling (1 subject [0.5%]). None of these events were considered serious and all were mild in severity 
(CTCAE grade 1).  
Study 20160442 
Adverse events mapping to the injection site reaction AMQ occurred in 12 subjects (11.5%), 6 subjects in 
each group.  
Injection site reaction events included injection site hemorrhage in 5 subjects (4.8%, 4 subjects in 1 x 1 
mL 140 mg/mL AI/pen group and 1 subject in 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL AI/pen group); injection site pain in 3 
subjects (2.9%, all in 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL AI/pen group); vessel puncture site hemorrhage in 3 subjects

(2.9%, 2 subjects in the 1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL AI/pen group and 1 subject in the 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL 
AI/pen group); and injection site bruising, injection site rash, and injection site reaction (1 subject [1.0%] 
each). None of these events were considered serious and all were mild in severity (CTCAE grade 1). The 
overall incidence of injection site reactions was the same for each formulation 
Safety in special populations 
Safety data relative to the following special groups and situations were not evaluated aspart of the 
erenumab 140-mg dose single-injection delivery system clinical studies: intrinsic factors, extrinsic 
factors, drug interactions, overdose, drug abuse, withdrawal and rebound, and effects on ability to drive 
or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation  
As of 31 January 2018 across the clinical development program, a total of 34 pregnancies have been 
reported in which subjects or their partners were exposed to erenumab or blinded investigational product 
before or during pregnancy. 
Table 7 – Cumulative Birth outcomes for Pregnancies in the Erenumab-aooe Clinical Program 
Through 31 January 2018 
NOS = not otherwise specified 
Pregnancies in subjects who were unblinded as having received placebo are not included in cumulative tabulations. 
 aSubject XXXXXXXXXXX: the baby had no reported birth complications or congenital anomalies but was admitted to the neonatal        
intensive care unit for 4 days. The reason for admission was not provided. 
The pregnancy outcomes are listed in Table 7 above. There have been no reports of infants receiving 
breast milk from mothers who were being treated with erenumab. 
In Study 20160349, there were 4 pregnancies reported in 3 subjects. One subject had 2 pregnancies: the 
first pregnancy was electively terminated, and the outcome of the subsequent pregnancy was lost to 
follow-up. For the remaining 2 subjects, 1 pregnancy was lost to follow-up (last contact indicated elective 
termination was planned), and the remaining pregnancy outcome was unknown with an anticipated date 
of delivery in March 2018. Narratives for pregnancies from Study 20160349 are also provided.

In Study 20160442, no pregnancies were reported. 
Overall, the numbers of pregnancies, information and outcomes reported are too limited to evaluate and 
conclude on the effects of erenumab on pregnancies. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials <and post-marketing> have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The new safety data were derived from the Phase 1 Study 20160349 evaluating the safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity profile, and PK of a single SC dose of 140 mg erenumab-aooe delivered by PFS as either 
1 injection of 140 mg (test) or 2 injections of 70 mg (reference) to healthy volunteers. The safety 
population included 211 subjects. In addition, safety data from a terminated phase 1 study (Study 
20160442) were included in the submission. This study was similar to 20160349 except that 
erenumab-aooe 140 mg was delivered by prefilled AI/pen. The safety population included 104 subjects. 
In study 20160349, treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups and were 
reported in 33.0% and 29.5% of subjects in the AMG 334 140 mg (2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL) and AMG 334 140 
mg (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL) groups respectively. The most common treatment-emergent AEs were 
headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and pain in extremity. Most AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. SAEs were reported in 1 (0.9%) and 2 (1.9%) subjects in the respective groups.  
One subject in the AMG 334 140 mg (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL) group with normal baseline aminotransferase 
experienced an SAE of drug-induced liver injury. The subject developed grade 4 ALT and AST elevations 
at day 10 after a single dose of AMG 140mg. The subject did not meet the criteria for Hy’s Law. This case 
was reviewed in detail given the close temporal relationship between the administration of Aimovig and 
the onset of the events. However, confounding factors were identified including concomitant medications 
(such as coamoxicillin/clavulanate and chlordiazepoxide) and medical history which precluded drawing 
conclusions on causality.  
In the original MAA for AMG334, a small number of subjects with normal baseline LFTs showed elevations 
to > 3 times ULN or > 5 times ULN during the 12-month AMG 334 treatment period. It was recommended 
that the risk of increased hepatic enzymes should be further monitored in the future PSUR. Based on the 
current DILI case, it is considered that this recommendation is still adequate, to which the applicant has 
agreed.  In this response, the applicant also agreed to continue to collect the necessary information on 
reported suspected adverse liver reactions with established PV practices which include written or verbal 
follow-up. This is considered acceptable at the current stage and this issue will be further monitored.  The 
applicant should ensure an adequate analysis of reports of increased hepatic enzymes and suspected 
adverse liver reactions cases for assessment in future PSURs. 
In study 20160442, treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 32.7% and 23.1% of subjects in the AMG 
334 140 mg (2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL) and AMG 334 140 mg (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL) groups, respectively. 
Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between treatment groups. The most 
frequently reported AEs were headache (5 subjects [4.8%] overall) and nausea (2 subjects [1.9%]). No 
SAEs were reported.  
In both studies, there were subjects who reported increased blood creatinine phosphokinase after 
receiving 140mg treatment (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL AI/pen or 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL AI/pen). In total, 5 of the 
315 subjects treated with erenumab reported Grade 3 (4 subjects) or Grade 4 (1) elevations. This should 
be further monitored in the future PSUR in line with the recommendation of the original MAA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199629/2019  
Page 20/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Device-related AEs and injection site reactions were generally similar between the erenumab-aooe (2 x 
1-mL 70 mg/mL) and the erenumab-aooe (1 x 1-mL 140 mg/mL) groups.  
The  results of the comparative  study (20160349) demonstrated that development of binding antibodies 
against erenumab-aooe and neutralizing antibodies against erenumab-aooe were similar between the 1 x 
1 mL 140-mg/mL PFS (test) group and 2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL PFS (reference) group. The presence of ADA 
did not influence the exposure of AMG334. This is in accordance with results from the original application. 
However, the incidence of ADAs was 17.9% in the present study which is somewhat higher compared to 
6.7% (56/884) among the subjects receiving a 70mg dose of erenumab and 2.6% (13/504) among 
subjects receiving a 140mg dose of erenumab in the original application although the same immunoassay 
was used.  No new safety concern of immunogenicity was identified based on the ADA data submitted in 
this application.  It is considered that the overall incidence of ADAs for Aimovig specified in the Current 
SmPC does not evoke new safety concerns. See also Discussion in PD section 3.3.5.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Studies 20160349 and 20160442 were submitted to support a line extension for the addition of a new 
strength of 140 mg, to Aimovig 70 mg. The safety data from these studies is consistent with the original 
application and no new concerns have been identified. The application may be approvable from a safety 
point of view.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Erenumab (AMG 334), Aimovig, is indicated for the preventative treatment of migraine in adults who have 
at least 4 migraine days per month. There are 2 dose options of 70 mg and 140 mg monthly (every 4 
weeks), delivered subcutaneously (SC) as either 1 or 2 injections, respectively, of 70-mg/mL 
autoinjector.  
The recommended dose is 70 mg erenumab every 4 weeks. Some patients may benefit from a dose of 
140 mg every 4 weeks. 
To avoid 2 separate injections for the 140-mg erenumab-aooe dose, a single-injection delivery system 
(AI/pen or PFS) has been developed.  
The proposed indication and recommended dose for Aimovig is the same as that already approved for 
Aimovig in EU.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Studies 20160349 and 20160442 were submitted to support a line extension for the addition of a new 
strength of 140 mg, to Aimovig 70 mg. These were phase 1, multicenter, open-label, randomized, 
parallel-group studies in healthy subjects studies comparing the new 140 mg strength with the already 
authorised 70 mg strength. 
Study 20160349 was conducted to assess the bioequivalence, pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity profile of a single dose of AMG 334 administered by 1x140 mg or 2x70 mg prefilled 
syringe subcutaneous (SC) injections, administered by a healthcare provider in the abdomen. Blood 
samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken pre-dose and up to 98 days post-dose. 
Study 20160442 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity profile, and PK of a 
single SC dose of 140 mg erenumab-aooe delivered by prefilled AI/pen as 1 injection (test) or 2 injections 
of 70 mg (reference). This study was initiated at risk prior to knowing regulatory bioequivalence 
requirements and was terminated before planned study completion. The results from Study 20160349 
are aimed to bridge the new 140 mg/mL formulation with currently approved product presentations. 
Safety data for Study 20160442 were summarized but the PK and anti-erenumab antibody samples 
collected were not tested and analyses were not conducted. This is considered as acceptable. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on the presented comparative bioavailability study (20160349), the new 140 mg prefilled syringe 
was bioequivalent to 2x70 mg of the already approved prefilled syringe. The results of study 20160349 
can be extrapolated to the 140 mg autoinjector pen. The 140 mg dose administered as two 1 mL

injections of 70 mg/mL in the 2 pivotal migraine studies were included in the original submission (Studies 
20120295 and 20120296).  
No new efficacy studies were conducted. The efficacy profile of Aimovig remains unchanged. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
N/A 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the results from Study 20160349 and Study 20160442 are quite consistent with the safety 
demonstrated in the original application.  
Study 20160349: injection site reaction events were reported in 5 subjects (2.4%) including 3 subjects 
(2.9%) in the erenumab 1 x 1 mL 140-mg/mL PFS (test) group and 2 subjects (1.9%) in the erenumab 
2 x 1 mL 70-mg/mL PFS (reference) group, which included injection site hemorrhage, injection site pain 
(2 subjects [0.9%] each); and injection site swelling (1 subject [0.5%]). All were mild in severity. 
Study 20160442: injection site reaction events were reported in 12 subjects (11.5%), 6 subjects in the 1 
x 1 mL 140 mg/mL AI/pen group and/or the 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL AI/pen group, which included injection 
site hemorrhage in 5 subjects (4.8%); injection site pain in 3 subjects (2.9%); vessel puncture site 
hemorrhage in 3 subjects (2.9%); and injection site bruising, injection site rash, and injection site 
reaction (1.0%). All were mild in severity.  
Among the treatment-emergent Adverse Events reported by Preferred Term Occurring in ≥ 2 Subjects 
(Study 20160349 and Study 20160442), constipation was reported in 2 subjects (1.9%) in the erenumab 
1 x 1 mL 140-mg/mL PFS  in Study 20160349.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In this application, one subject in the AMG 334 140 mg (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL) group with normal baseline 
aminotransferase experienced an SAE of drug-induced liver injury. The subject developed grade 4 ALT 
and AST elevations at day 10 after a single dose of AMG 140mg. The subject did not meet the criteria for 
Hy’s Law. This case was reviewed in detail given the close temporal relationship between the 
administration of Aimovig and the onset of the events. However, confounding factors were identified 
including concomitant medications (such as coamoxicillin/clavulanate and chlordiazepoxide) and medical 
history which precluded drawing conclusions on causality.  
It was recommended that the risk of increased hepatic enzymes should be further monitored in the future 
PSUR. Based on the current DILI case, it is considered that this recommendation is still adequate. The 
applicant also agreed to continue to collect the necessary information on reported suspected adverse liver 
reactions with established PV practices which include written or verbal follow-up to ensure an adequate 
analysis of increased hepatic enzymes reports and suspected adverse liver reactions cases for 
assessment in future PSURs. 
In both studies, there were subjects who reported increased blood creatinine phosphokinase after 
receiving 140mg treatment (1 x 1 mL 140 mg/mL AI/pen or 2 x 1 mL 70 mg/mL AI/pen). In total, 5 of the 
Assessment report

315 subjects treated with erenumab reported Grade 3 (4 subjects) or Grade 4 (1) elevations. This should 
be further monitored in the future PSUR in line with the recommendation of the original MAA. 
Overall, the results from Study 20160349 and Study 20160442 are quite consistent with the safety 
demonstrated in the original application. No new safety concerns were identified. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
This line extension concerns a new strength of Aimovig, 140 mg to be administered as a single monthly 
injection. Based on the assessment of the pivotal study 20160349, it is concluded that the new 140 mg 
prefilled syringe is considered bioequivalent to 2x70 mg of the already approved prefilled syringe. The 
results of study 20160349 can be extrapolated to the 140 mg autoinjector pen.  
No major objections were identified that would preclude this extension of marketing authorization from 
quality perspective and this line extension of Aimovig is approvable from the quality point of view. 
The safety profile from Study 20160349 and Study 20160442 are quite consistent with the safety 
demonstrated in the original application. No new safety concerns were identified.  
The proposed indication and recommended dose for Aimovig is the same as that already approved for 
Aimovig in EU. In principle, provided data are considered to support the approval of Aimovig 1ml 
140mg/ml formulation in addition to the already approved Aimovig 1ml 70mg/ml. 
3.6.2.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Aimovig (Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 140 mg and Solution for injection in 
pre-filled pen 140 mg) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, pharmacokinetics and safety the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Aimovig new strength  is favourable in the following indication: 
Aimovig is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Aimovig subject to 
the following conditions:

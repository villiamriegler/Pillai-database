1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 3 March 2022 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for tislelizumab, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
Tislelizumab, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/20/2357 on 13 November 2020 in 
the following condition: treatment of adult patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or 
metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior chemotherapy. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Tevimbra as monotherapy is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma after prior chemotherapy. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0142/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance tislelizumab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

1.5.  Scientific Advice  
The applicant received the following protocol assistance on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application: 
Date 
Reference 
SAWP co-ordinators 
14 December 2017  EMEA/H/SA/3646/2/2017/II 
Dr Paolo Foggi and Dr Kolbeinn 
Gudmundsson 
The Scientific Advice pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
• 
The Design and elements of the proposed pivotal study 302 including eligibility criteria, 
stratification factors, geographic distribution, comparator, primary endpoint, interim analysis and 
statistical plan; the appropriateness of said study to support approval in the sought indication was 
in particular discussed.  
• 
• 
• 
In their advice, the CHMP overall acknowledged the design (open label monotherapy vs ICC) and 
the main elements of the study, including most eligibility criteria, the comparators, primary 
endpoint (OS) and the proposed statistical methodology. It was pointed out that the results of a 
single trial should be compelling to support approval. It was further recommended to the 
applicant to ensure representativeness of EU patients, to explore other stratification factors, to 
plan in advance for biomarker subgroup analyses and to consider generating comparative data vs 
best supportive care for less fit patients. The planned interim analysis of study 302 as proposed 
was discouraged on the basis of immaturity. A general comment to justify the dose and schedule 
of the product for further clinical development also ensued. 
The size of the safety database to be generated (approximately 300 oesophageal squamous cell 
cancer patients and approximately 1000 patients with various tumour types with monotherapy) to 
support a future approval. The CHMP considered it of reasonable size to allow assessment.  
The safety management plan. This was also endorsed by the CHMP. 
The appropriateness of the proposed instruments to measure quality of life (EORTC QLQC30, 
EORTC OES-18 and EQ-5D). These were considered adequate for the proposed patient population 
and line of treatment. 
It may be noted that the main clinical study 302 subject of this MAA (refer to section 2.6.5) is 
overall compliant with the above advice received, as the Applicant has retained the design, 
introduced other stratification factors, used OS as primary and removed the interim analysis. 
In the interest of transparency, it is also noted here that the Applicant, either directly or through 
its co-developer also received Scientific advice in other indications that are not discussed in this 
report. These include first line hepatocellular carcinoma (EMEA/3646/1/2017/II) first line 
unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer (EMEA/SA/3646/3/2018/II) 
esophageal cancer, first line gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma 
(EMA/SA/3646/4/2018/II) as well as advice in solid tumours in general (EMA/SA/0000121172).

20 July 2023 
(NAS) status of the active substance contained in the medicinal product  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially claimed therapeutic indication was: “Tevimbra as monotherapy is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma after prior chemotherapy.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Oesophageal cancer (OC) is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth most common cause of 
cancer-related death worldwide, with an estimated 604,100 new cases and 544,076 deaths (5.5% of 
all cancer mortality) observed in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 2020, accessed 04 March 2021). In 2018, the 
highest mortality rates of EC were found in Eastern Asia (with an age-standardized rate of 10.7), 
Eastern Africa (8.2), Southern Africa (7.2), and Northern Europe (4.3) (Huang et al 2021). Although 
EC is a rare disease in Europe (annual incidence approximately 1/13,300, according to Orphanet), it 
remains a highly fatal disease and a major cause of cancer mortality.  
Oesophageal cancers are histologically classified as squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) or 
adenocarcinoma (EAC), which differ in their pathology, tumour location, and prognosis. Although OSCC 
accounts for 
90% of cases of oesophageal cancer worldwide (Abnet et al. 2018), mortality rates 
associated with EAC are rising and have surpassed those of OSCC in several regions in the EU (Castro 
et al. Ann Oncol 2014). Esophageal carcinoma is rare in young people and increases in incidence with 
∼
age, peaking in the seventh and eighth decades of life. EAC is three to four times as common in men 
as it is in women, whereas the sex distribution is more equal for OSCC (Rustgi et al. N Engl J Med 
2014). The main risk factors for OSCC in Western countries include tobacco and alcohol consumption. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
OSCC is usually asymptomatic until an advanced disease stage with common presenting symptoms 
being dysphagia (at first with solids then progressing to fluids) and weight loss. Thus, diagnosis is 
often made late in the disease course in countries where screening programs for early detection of EC 
are not in use or are impractical because of low incidence rates. According to the National Cancer 
Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (SEER 2021), one-third of US 
patients with OSCC had lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes, and 39% had distant metastases at 
the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival for localized disease is 32.0% but drops to 24.0% for 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023

regional disease and 6.1% for patients with distant metastases. Patients diagnosed or treated once 
OSCC has progressed face a very poor prognosis (Abraham et al 2020). 
2.1.4.  Management 
Depending on the clinical situation, patients with advanced (metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent 
after curative therapy) OSCC have different palliative treatment options. Platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy (cisplatin/oxaliplatin/carboplatin plus fluoropyrimidines or taxanes) is usually offered as 
first-line palliative therapy aiming at an extension of survival of patients with good performance status 
(Lordick et al. 2016, Muro et al. 2019, NCCN 2020). Unfit patients (ECOG PS >1) are treated with best 
supportive care. Localized treatments such as radiotherapy (including external radiation or 
brachytherapy) and endoscopic therapies (stents) are applied for the symptomatic treatment of 
obstruction and dysphagia. 
At the time of the initiation of the pivotal study (Study 302) for this submission, there were no 
approved therapies for patients with advanced or metastatic OSCC after failure of 1st line therapy. 
Back then, single-agent palliative chemotherapy (taxanes, irinotecan) was recommended and 
commonly used in medical practice for patients with good PS scores (0 or 1) following 1st line systemic 
therapy worldwide (NCCN 2017). 
Nivolumab received a positive opinion from EMA in October 2020 as monotherapy for the treatment of 
patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic OSCC after prior fluoropyrimidine- and 
platinum-based combination chemotherapy based on the results of ATTRACTION-3 (Kato et al 2019).  
Unmet medical need 
Efficacy of palliative systemic chemotherapy used in the 2nd line setting of advanced and/or metastatic 
OSCC has been described to be limited with fewer than 20% of patients responding to treatment and 
poor long-term survival (median OS of approx. 3 to 7 months). On the other hand, single-agent 
palliative chemotherapy is associated with substantial haematological, gastrointestinal, and 
neurological toxicities. As such, there was an urgent need for efficacious therapies for OSCC with 
improved tolerability in the 2nd line setting (Burkart et al 2007, Mizota et al 2011, Shirakawa et al 
2014, Song and Zhang 2014). 
PD-1 inhibitors have demonstrated survival improvement over chemotherapy in patients with advanced 
or metastatic OSCC previously treated with systemic therapy (Kato et al 2019, Kojima et al 2020). 
2.2.  About the product 
Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody that binds to the T-cell surface receptor 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) with high specificity and affinity (KD = 0.15 nM). It 
competitively blocks the binding of both PD-L1 and PD-L2, inhibiting PD-1-mediated negative 
signalling. As such, upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumours and signalling through this 
pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumours, which is 
counteracted by the administration of PD-1 inhibitors like tislelizumab. The antibody does not bind to 
Fc gamma receptors and C1q and therefore does not induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity. 
Tislelizumab belongs to the therapeutic subgroup L01 (antineoplastic agents) of the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical Classification System.

multipacks containing 2 (2 x 1) vials. 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
Tislelizumab  is  a  Fc  engineered  humanised  immunoglobulin  G4  (IgG4)  variant  monoclonal  antibody 
produced in recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The antibody binds to the programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor on the T-cell surface, preventing interaction with PD-1 ligands PD-
L1 and PD-L2, thereby blocking PD-1-mediated inhibitory signalling. 
Tislelizumab consists of two heterodimers, each composed of a heavy and a light polypeptide chain. The 
amino acid sequences of the light chain (LC) and heavy chain (HC) in tislelizumab are shown in Figure 
1.  The  theoretical  molecular  weight  calculated  from  the  amino  acid  sequence  is  144,080  Dalton. 
Tislelizumab is composed of 1318 amino acid residues, 445 in the HC and 214 in the LC. Each HC contains 
one N-glycosylation site at asparagine 295. Post-translational modifications concern the N-termini with 
a  N-term  pyroglutamate,  or  Pyr-Q,  and  the  C-termini  with  a  C-term  lysine  clipped,  -K,  as  well  as  a 
glycosylation at the conserved Fc glycosylation site. Due to the modulations in the Fc region, tislelizumab 
does not bind to Fc gamma receptors and C1q. Therefore, it does not include antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity  (ADCC),  antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP)  and/or complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC). 
The physicochemical properties of tislelizumab active substance are provided in the dossier. The general 
information is considered sufficient.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The  active  substance  is  manufactured,  tested  and  released  in  accordance  with  Good  Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP). The site responsible for the manufacture of the active substance is Boehringer Ingelheim 
Biopharmaceuticals (China) Ltd., 1090 Halei Road Pilot Free Trade Zone, 201203 Shanghai, China. 
During the procedure, a Major Objection (MO) was raised for the lack of proof of EU GMP compliance for 
several of the active substance manufacturing sites. Following remote inspection and/or agreement to 
conduct a post-approval inspection at the concerned sites from the responsible Supervisory Authorities, 
EU GMP compliance for the active substance manufacturing sites has been confirmed. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The  overall  active  substance  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  presented  in  the  dossier.  The 
tislelizumab active substance is expressed in the CHO cell expression system. The manufacturing process 
is divided into cell culture/harvest (upstream) and purification (downstream) steps. 
To initiate the tislelizumab cell culture process, working cell bank (WCB) is thawed and cells are cultivated 
under controlled conditions. After vial thaw, a series of sequential passages are performed to expand 
and scale-up the tislelizumab cell culture before being finally transferred into the production bioreactor. 
During the harvest unit operation, cells and cell debris are separated from the cell culture fluid of the 
production bioreactor containing tislelizumab active substance to provide harvested cell culture fluid for 
purification. The purification of the active substance starts with a Protein A affinity chromatography to 
remove process-related impurities. Viral reduction follows during a virus inactivation and pH adjustment 
step. Turbidities are removed by depth filtration subsequently. Process-related impurities are removed 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 15/165 
 
  
 
 
 
further by several other chromatography techniques. Virus filtration is conducted as a second orthogonal 
method specifically dedicated for viral clearance that provides additional assurance of viral safety by the 
physical  removal  of  potential  adventitious  viruses  by  size.  After  ultrafiltration  and  diafiltration  during 
tangential  flow  filtration,  the  tislelizumab  active  substance  is  supplemented  with  spike  buffer  and 
formulation buffer to achieve the target product concentration and excipient composition. 
Lastly, the filtration and storage unit operation includes filtration of the active substance into a mixing 
bag with subsequent transfer into bags for long-term storage.   
The container closure system (CCS) for tislelizumab active substance is a single-use pre-sterilized bag 
that  complies  with  the  compendial  requirements.  Sufficient  details  on  the  CCS,  including  materials, 
dimensions and technical drawings are provided in the dossier. 
Adequate definition of a batch of tislelizumab active substance is included in the dossier. Reprocessing 
is claimed for several manufacturing steps and the proposed approach is considered acceptable. 
An  extractables  assessment  was  performed  based  on  extractables  study  data  to  identify  potential 
leachables present in both tislelizumab active substance and finished product manufacturing processes, 
which  may  adversely  affect  patient  safety.  Polymeric  materials  used  throughout  the  manufacturing 
processes  were  assessed  by  review  of  associated  extractables  data  available  for  each  material.  The 
leachable study results, by all analyses, detected no elemental impurities with a concentration greater 
than or  equal to  the  corresponding  Permitted  Daily Exposure  (PDE)  limits  and  no  organic  compounds 
with a concentration greater than or equal to the corresponding Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET) 
limits. Therefore, the leachables study supports the conclusion that potential leachables present in the 
tislelizumab active substance/finished product manufacturing processes and/or in the active substance 
CCS pose no risk to patient safety. 
Overall, the active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described and the in-process 
controls (IPCs) are indicated for each step, with adequately justified acceptance criteria. It is mentioned 
that a deviation procedure, which includes an investigation, is followed when any normal operating range 
(NOR)  or  proven  acceptable  range  (PAR)  limits  for  process  parameters  (PP)  are  exceeded  or  when 
excursions for critical (CPP), key (KPP) and non-key (non-KPP) process parameters occur. This approach 
is endorsed.  
In conclusion, the active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Control of materials  
Sufficient information on raw materials has been submitted by the applicant. Raw materials and reagents 
for  the  manufacture  of  tislelizumab  active  substance  are  commercial  or  prepared  from  commercially 
available  materials  and  are  qualified.  Compendial  raw  materials  comply  with  their  respective 
monographs. None of the raw materials of the manufacturing process are of animal or human origin. 
The  composition  of  media  for  cell  banking,  growth  and  production,  feed  is  provided  and  process 
parameters for media preparation are indicated.  
Tislelizumab is expressed in CHO cells. Sufficient information regarding cell line development has been 
presented in the dossier. Master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB) and end-of-production cell 
banks (EOPCBs) were tested for identity, sterility, mycoplasma, endogenous and adventitious viruses. 
The  limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age  (LIVCA)  has  been  established  for  the  tislelizumab  production  cell  line  in 
accordance with ICH Q5B.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A  comprehensive  overview  of  critical  in-process  controls  and  critical  in-process  tests  performed 
throughout the tislelizumab active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 16/165 
 
  
 
 
been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing 
process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. Actions 
taken if limits are exceeded are specified. The critical manufacturing controls are supported by process 
characterization  studies,  additional  supportive  studies  and  manufacturing  experience.  Hold  time  CPPs 
through both harvest and purification processes are established and considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
Process validation follows a master validation plan to control consistent and robust quality of the active 
substance.  A  three-stage  approach  to  validation  was  followed:  Stage  1  -  Process  Design,  Stage  2  - 
Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) and Stage 3 - Continued Process Verification.  
Process  characterization  studies  and  scale  down  models  were  conducted  to  support  the  commercial 
manufacturing  process  control  strategy  and  to  ensure  robust  process  performance  and  consistent 
product  quality.  Quality  attributes  (QA)  are  established  and  the  criticality  of  each  quality  attribute  is 
assessed  with  respect  to  impact  on  biological  activity,  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  and 
immunogenicity and safety, which are directly linked to product efficacy and safety. 
Impact  of  non-conformities  to  the  product  quality  or  to  the  validation  execution  was  assessed  and 
corrective  and  preventive  actions  (CAPAs)  were  initiated  as  appropriate.  Results  of  the  process 
performance  qualification  (PPQ)  demonstrated  that  the  tislelizumab  manufacturing  process  is 
consistently  capable  of  producing  product  meeting  predefined  criteria  for  each  PPQ  batch,  including 
repeatability and consistency of all PPQ batches manufactured. Reprocessing, hold times and resin reuse 
are validated within supporting validation studies.  
In conclusion, the active substance manufacturing process is adequately validated. 
Manufacturing process development  
The  commercial  active  substance  manufacturing  process  was  developed  in  parallel  with  the  clinical 
development program. Several important changes have been introduced during the development of the 
manufacturing process. These include changes to manufacturing site, scale and to the process itself.  
The tislelizumab final manufacturing process (FMP) is the process intended for commercial manufacturing 
and was the only source of active substance used in the pivotal study for the Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA). 
Comparability studies were performed at every major stage of development to assure product quality 
and  performance.  The  comparability  assessment  showed  no  impact  to  purity  and  potency.  All  active 
substance  batches  met  the  predetermined  comparability  criteria.  The  additional  characterization 
confirmed  the  consistent  higher-order  structure  and  biophysical  properties.  Slight  differences  in 
glycosylation were observed, which were attributed to variability in the cell culture medium used. Despite 
these  differences,  no  changes  in  functional  attributes  were  correlated  to  an  increase  or  decrease  of 
specific  glycan  forms  or  charge  variant  groups.  Therefore,  tislelizumab  manufacturing  process  was 
demonstrated to be comparable throughout development.  
Characterization 
Structure, physicochemical characteristics and biological properties of tislelizumab were elucidated by 
release  tests  and  additional  characterization  assays.  The  analytical  results  are  consistent  with  the 
proposed structure.  
Primary,  secondary  and  higher  order  structure  has  been  thoroughly  characterised  applying  various 
orthogonal methods, revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a human IgG4-
type  antibody.  Furthermore,  heterogeneity  of  the  active  substance  was  adequately  characterised  by 
analysing size and charge variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 17/165 
 
  
 
 
Biological characterization of tislelizumab indicates that this antibody has a high affinity for human PD-
1 and binds to the extracellular domain of PD-1, as well as to the native PD-1 expressed on cell surface, 
in a dose-dependent manner. Binding activities of tislelizumab to Fc gamma receptors and C1q protein 
were analysed and results show that tislelizumab does not bind to different Fc gamma receptors and has 
little or no binding to C1q. ADCC and CDC activity of tislelizumab was characterized by cell-based assays 
and  neither  ADCC,  nor  CDC  activity  were  detected,  as  expected  for  IgG4  construct.  Process-related 
impurities  comprise  of  impurities  originating  from  the  cell  substrates,  cell  culture  and  purification 
processing.  During  process  characterisation  studies  and  process  validation  campaigns,  sufficient 
clearance of certain process-related impurities was shown. Based on the provided data, it is acceptable 
that  tests  for  these  impurities  are  not  included  as  in-process  controls  or  in  the  tislelizumab  active 
substance  release  specification.  In  summary,  the  characterisation  data  presented  are  considered 
appropriate for this type of molecule. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The  release  and  stability  specification  for  tislelizumab  active  substance  are  set  based  on  regulatory 
guidelines,  analytical  capability,  process  capability  and  clinical  experience.  The  tislelizumab 
release/stability  specification  includes  general  tests,  test  for  identity,  purity  and  impurity  tests  for 
product-related impurities, test for process-related impurities, test for protein content, biological activity, 
as well as tests for safety parameters.  
During the assessment, the applicant was requested to tighten the acceptance criteria for several quality 
attributes (bacterial endotoxin and biological activity). Additionally, inclusion of a quantitative acceptance 
criteria  for  glycan  content  was  requested.  A  recommendation  to  monitor  the  glycan  content,  until  a 
sufficient  number  of  active  substance  batches  is  manufactured  to  document  manufacturing  process 
consistency and determine if the quantitative control of glycan content for tislelizumab release testing is 
required, has been given (Recommendation). 
Overall, the parameters included in the active substance release and shelf-life specification are found 
adequate to control the quality of tislelizumab.  
Analytical methods 
Method  descriptions  for  all  non-compendial  analytical  procedures  are  provided  and  validations  are 
performed according to ICH Q2(R1). The compendial methods have been verified to demonstrate the 
suitability for the intended purpose. The biological activity of tislelizumab is determined by a cell-based 
assay, measuring the ability of the active substance to block PD-1 receptor from engaging with the target 
ligand PD-L1. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided, cover early-stage batches produced by the 
original manufacturing process and late-stage batches produced by the final manufacturing process. All 
batch  analysis  data  were  in  line  with  the  acceptance  criteria  that  applied  at  the  time  of  testing.  The 
results for batch release demonstrate a high level of batch-to-batch consistency.  
Reference materials 
A 2-tiered reference standard (RS) system has been established with a primary reference standard (PRS) 
and a working reference standard (WRS).  
The  information  provided  is  found  sufficient  and  the  extent  of  the  qualification  of  the  standards  is 
adequate.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 18/165 
 
  
 
 
Future  WRS  will  be  prepared  form  representative  commercial  active  substance  batches.  A  detailed 
protocol for the characterisation and qualification of future WRS has been provided, including sufficient 
description of potency assignment. Requalification protocols for the PRS and WRS have been included 
and are found acceptable. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The proposed shelf-life for the tislelizumab active substance is 24 months in the defined CCS and at the 
proposed long-term storage condition. 
The active substance stability program is conducted according to ICH Q1A (R2) and ICH Q5C. Primary 
data are derived from PPQ batches and from additional representative clinical batches, manufactured at 
the  proposed  commercial  site.  All  primary  stability  batches  were  manufactured  using  the  final 
manufacturing  process  and  the  CCS  used  is  representative  of  the  commercial  container  closure.  In 
addition to data from the primary stability studies, data from supportive stability batches manufactured 
using the original manufacturing process are also provided. 
In  summary,  the  stability  data  demonstrate  that  the  active  substance  is  stable  at  the  recommended 
long-term storage condition for all attributes tested, supporting the proposed shelf-life of 24 months. All 
stability data remain within the clinical specifications in place at the time of testing, indicating that there 
have been no significant changes in terms of potency, quality or purity of the  active substance when 
stored at the long-term condition. No change has been observed relative to the initial time point and the 
results meet the acceptance criteria for all analytical procedures applied. In addition, data from stability 
studies conducted under accelerated and stressed conditions are also included in the dossier and results 
are adequately discussed. 
Additionally, forced degradation studies were performed to further characterize the active substance and 
to build knowledge around specific molecular degradation pathways and resilience of the molecule under 
various  stressed  conditions.  The  results  obtained  demonstrate  that  selected  analytical  methods  are 
stability  indicating.  The  applicant  commits  to  conduct  and  complete  the  ongoing  long-term  stability 
studies of the primary batches, which includes stability studies for process validation batches, according 
to the stability protocols. This approach is endorsed.

secured  with  aluminium  flip-off  seal  caps.  The  finished  product  CCS  complies  with  compendial 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 19/165 
 
  
 
 
requirements. Suitability of the CCS is supported by the chemical resistance of the selected components, 
container  closure  integrity  testing  (CCIT)  and  stability  data.  In  addition,  extractable  and  leachables 
studies were performed, in line with ICH Q3D guideline. The extractables study identified no extractables 
requiring  further  investigation.  The  leachables  study  results  indicate  that  all  elemental  analyses  were 
below the PDE and all organic compounds were below the AET, with the exception of two substances of 
interest. However, as both compounds were detected at levels well below the safety threshold, no further 
toxicology evaluation was needed. In summary, test results support the conclusion that the selected CCS 
is compatible with the finished product and adequate for the intended use of the product throughout the 
shelf-life.  
The  commercial  formulation  of  the  finished  product  was  established  in  formulation  screening  and 
robustness  studies.  The  objective  of  the  finished  product  formulation  development  program  was  to 
develop  a  formulation  sufficiently  stable  and  robust  for  manufacturing,  storage,  transportation  and 
administration of tislelizumab by intravenous infusion. There have been no changes in the formulation 
of  tislelizumab  finished  product  between  the  toxicology  batches  used  for  nonclinical  safety  studies, 
clinical batches and the planned commercial batches.  
Over  the  course  of  manufacturing  process  development,  the  manufacturing  process  has  undergone 
several changes as appropriate for each development stage. These changes were primarily associated 
with the transfer to the commercial manufacturing site, process scale-up and change of the CCS. Process 
characterization, process transfer and comparability studies were conducted to support the commercial 
manufacturing  process  control  strategy  and  to  ensure  robust  process  performance  and  consistent 
finished product quality. 
The clinical dose of 200 mg is delivered using two 100 mg vials via intravenous administration with a 
0.22 µm filter, upon dilution with saline solution. Compatibility with representative infusion bags, infusion 
lines  and  in-line  filter  has  been  investigated  in-use  stability  studies  and  results  demonstrate  that  the 
diluted tislelizumab injection solution is stable for 24 hours at refrigerated conditions (2°C to 8°C), as 
well as 4 hours at 25°C ± 2°C, when in contact with clinically representative plastics. Further studies 
demonstrate  that  no  microbial  proliferation  occurred  in  spiked  0.9%  saline  bags  for  48  hours  at  the 
refrigerated conditions (2°C to 8°C) and for 8 hours at room temperature conditions (25°C ± 2°C). The 
proposed in-use period and storage conditions stated in the SmPC are therefore supported. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacture,  control,  packaging  and  release  of  tislelizumab  finished  product  is  performed,  in 
accordance with GMP. The sites responsible for the batch release of the finished product are: Novartis 
Farmacéutica, S.A., Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 764, 08013 Barcelona, Spain and Novartis Pharma 
GmbH, Roonstrasse 25, 90429 Nuremberg, Germany. 
During the procedure, a Major Objection (MO) was raised for the lack of proof of EU GMP compliance for 
several  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  sites.  The  MO  was  resolved,  reference  is  made  to  the 
active substance section. 
The  tislelizumab  finished  product  manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  unit  operations: 
thawing, bioburden reduction filtration and pooling, sterile filtration, filling and stoppering, capping and 
visual inspection.  
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  includes  no  additional  formulation  steps,  hence  all 
physicochemical and biological properties of the finished product are the same as those for the active 
substance. Controls for CPPs and IPCs (including microbiologic contamination control) with process limits 
and  acceptance  criteria  are  established  for  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  to  ensure 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 20/165 
 
  
 
 
consistent process performance and product quality. Hold times for thawing and pooled active substance 
have been adequately defined.  
A three-stage approach to validation of the finished product manufacturing process was followed: Stage 
1 - Process Design, Stage 2 - Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) and Stage 3 - Continued Process 
Verification. The predefined PPQ requirement of the finished product batches was determined based on 
platform  experience,  process  development  knowledge  and  manufacturing  history.  PPQ  batches  are 
subject to increased scrutiny of process performance and extended sampling and testing, and encompass 
all  unit  operations  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process.  The  PPQ  campaign  was  performed 
under  cGMP  conditions,  with  defined  targets  and/or  ranges  for  process  parameters  equivalent  to  the 
NORs. All CPPs and KPPs were assessed per PPQ protocol. All process parameters were within all NORs 
and all outputs met all process validation limits and acceptance criteria. As a consequence, all validated 
ranges or limits are implemented as the commercial process NORs, PARs and IPCs process limits or IPC 
acceptance criteria. The consistency and reproducibility of the intermediate hold times were successfully 
validated during the PPQ campaign with the demonstration that the intermediate hold validation batches 
met all predefined validation criteria.  
Taken  together,  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  is  considered  validated  and  it  has  been 
demonstrated that the process is capable of producing a product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.  
Results  of  shipping  qualification  for  non-simulated  shipment  over  a  worst-case  distance  of  the  bulk 
finished product between China and a site in the US and back to China for testing have been further 
provided. It is concluded that there is no adverse effect on the tislelizumab finished product. The same 
conclusion results upon risk assessment of the second shipping configuration and associated shipment 
of bulk finished product from China to a secondary packaging site in Switzerland. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specification includes general tests, test for protein content, test for identity, 
purity and impurity tests for product-related impurities and heterogeneity, biological activity, as well as 
tests  for  safety  parameters.  Polysorbate  20  content  is  tested  at  both  release  and  stability.  Further, 
container closure integrity is tested during stability.  
The general approach for selection of the attributes included in the finished product release and stability 
specification  is  based  on  clinical  safety,  efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  statistical  analysis  of 
release and stability data and historical understanding of the finished product performance/formulation 
robustness  studies.  Further,  compendial  requirements  are  considered.  Overall,  the  selection  of 
specification  attributes  and  setting  of  the  acceptance  criteria  are  in  line  with  ICH  Q6B  and  are  found 
adequate  to  control  the  quality  of  the  tislelizumab  finished  product.  However,  similar  to  the  active 
substance specification, some adjustments/tightening of the acceptance criteria for biological activity, 
visible particles and bacterial endotoxin were performed upon request.  
No additional process or product-related impurities are introduced or expected to form as a result of the 
finished product manufacturing. Therefore, finished product impurities are expected to be the same as 
those described in the active substance section.  
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004-  Nitrosamine 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 21/165 
 
  
 
 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted  that  no  risk  was  identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance  or  the  related  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control  measures  are  deemed 
necessary. In addition, the risk of extractable, leachables and elemental impurities is found sufficiently 
addressed and no additional controls are necessary, as stated in the active substance section. 
Analytical methods 
The finished product is tested using both compendial and non-compendial methods. Many of the methods 
used to test the finished product are equivalent to the methods used to test the active substance, since 
there is no compositional difference between the active substance and the finished product with respect 
to  protein  concentration  or  formulation.  The  only  non-compendial  method  which  is  unique  to  finished 
product is determination of polysorbate 20 content, for which appropriate validation data in accordance 
with ICH guidelines have been provided. 
The applicant has declared that a new method employing a demasking procedure coupled with endotoxin 
determination is currently under development. Therefore, the applicant is recommended to communicate 
the outcome of method evaluation to the authority immediately upon finalisation (Recommendation). 
Batch analysis 
The data for all tislelizumab finished product batches used during clinical development and manufactured 
at the commercial manufacturing facility, demonstrate that all batches met the specifications in place at 
the time of release, are comparable across production sites and scales and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Reference materials  
Reference is made to the corresponding active substance section. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The applicant claims a shelf-life for the finished product of 36 months when stored at 2°C to 8°C in the 
defined CCS. 
Stability results for tislelizumab finished product stored under recommended long-term conditions (5°C 
± 3°C) and under accelerated conditions (25°C ± 2°C, 60% ± 5% RH) are provided. Primary stability 
data  are  derived  from  finished  product  PPQ  batches  and  from  representative  clinical  finished  product 
batches, all batches being manufactured at the commercial site and packaged in the CCS. Data from 
supportive stability clinical batches are also provided. All the primary and supportive stability finished 
product batches have the same formulation composition and protein concentration.  
A photostability study was conducted in line with ICH Q1B and data obtained show no significant impact 
on the finished product quality after exposure to light. Nevertheless, the SmPC statement “Store in the 
original carton in order to protect from light” is kept as a precaution due to optimal storage. This approach 
is considered acceptable. 
As discussed in the Pharmaceutical Development section, in-use stability of the diluted finished product 
solution has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. The 24 hours include storage of the diluted 
solution under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C) for no more than 20 hours, time required for returning to room 
temperature (25°C or below) and time to complete the infusion within 4 hours.  
In  summary,  the  stability  data  demonstrate  that  the  tislelizumab  finished  product  is  stable  at  the 
recommended  long-term  storage  condition  of  2°C  to  8°C,  as  mentioned  in  the  SmPC,  supporting  the 
proposed shelf-life of 36 months.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 22/165 
 
  
 
 
The  applicant  commits to conduct  and  complete the  ongoing  stability  studies,  which includes  stability 
studies for process validation batches, according to the stability protocols. This approach is endorsed. 
2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
Two post-approval change management protocols (PACMPs) are included in Module 3.2.R of the dossier. 
The protocols concern: 
1. Introduction of an additional active substance manufacturing and testing site.  
2.  Introduction  of  an  additional  finished  product  manufacturing  site,  as  well  as  introduction  of  two 
additional finished product testing sites. 
Overall, the strategies provided in both PACMPs are considered adequate. Provided that the PACMPs are 
fulfilled and successfully implemented, it is agreed that the changes can be accepted. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) compliance 
No animal-derived or human-derived components were used in the manufacture of the MCB and WCB. 
No animal-derived or human-derived components were used during cell line development and generation 
of the MCB. None of the raw materials used during manufacturing of active substance or finished product 
are of animal or human origin. No human or animal-derived excipients are used at formulation of the 
finished  product.  One  animal-derived  material,  sheep-wool–derived  cholesterol,  was  used  in  the 
development  of  the  MHCB,  which  was  transfected  to  generate  MCB,  for  which  a  TSE  Certificate  was 
provided.  
In  summary,  compliance  with  “Note  for  guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal 
spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products (EMA/410/01 rev.3)” 
requirement has been demonstrated. 
Virus safety 
The antibody is produced in a cell culture medium, free of animal or human-derived components. MCB 
and WCB and cells from end of production have been sufficiently tested for adventitious and endogenous 
viruses.  The  tests  demonstrate  the  absence  of  viral  contaminants.  Only  retrovirus-like  particles  have 
been detected,  which  is  expected  for this  type of  cells.  A retroviral  risk  assessment  demonstrated  an 
excess reduction capacity for retroviral particles within manufacturing process. The presence of retroviral 
particles is therefore justified. The purification process includes four steps, including virus filtration, which 
all have been validated for their virus removal capacity of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.  
Overall, sufficient virus inactivation/removal capacity has been demonstrated. 
2.4.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 23/165 
 
  
 
 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  active  substance  and/or  finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing 
process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
One Major Objection was raising during the assessment for the lack of valid EU GMP certificates for active 
substance and finished product sites, which has been adequately addressed by the end of the procedure. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  a  number  of  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  having  no 
impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product,  which  pertain  to  the:  1)  requirement  to  continue 
monitoring the glycan content at the active substance level until a sufficient number of batches has been 
manufactured to document manufacturing process consistency and 2) requirement to update the dossier 
with  an  optimized  endotoxin  test  procedure  once  validation  of  the  new  procedure  is  finalised.  These 
points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The Applicant proposes to monitor glycan content through a continued process verification protocol 
in  which  glycan  content  can  be  quantitatively  monitored  in  all  commercially  manufactured  active 
substance lots for the first year of manufacture, and trending analysis performed to ensure levels 
are not drifting or changing in a meaningful manner over time. A determination can then be made 
after the first year as to whether continued quantitative control of glycan content for active substance 
release testing is required. This approach is supported, provided that a sufficient number of active 
substance batches is manufactured to document manufacturing process consistency. The Applicant 
is recommended to follow this approach and submit a suitable variation application when sufficient 
data is available to support discontinued quantitative control of glycan content for active substance 
release testing. 
2.  For  the  determination  of  bacterial  endotoxin,  low  endotoxin  recovery  (LER)  was  observed  in  the 
finished product. The Applicant has declared that a new method employing a demasking procedure 
coupled  with  endotoxin  determination  is  currently  under  development.  The  Applicant  is 
recommended  to  communicate  the  outcome  of  method  evaluation  to  the  authorities  immediately 
upon finalisation.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 variant antibody derived from a murine hybridoma clone. The 
proposed mode of action consists in binding to the check-point molecule PD-1, blocking its signal 
transduction and consequently enhancing immune cell functions, possibly leading to inhibition of 
tumour growth in vivo.  
Non-clinical studies are based on the requirements of the ICH S6 and S9 guidelines; therefore, a 
reduced package of studies was submitted. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology  
2.5.3.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant performed a wide panel of in-vitro studies to characterise tislelizumab binding to its 
target PD-1 and its subsequent whished effect (i.e. re-activation of immune response). From the 
results shown, tislelizumab seems to specifically bind to PD-1 (and to cynomolgus PD-1, but not to 
murine PD-1) with KD in the order of 0.1-0.2 nM. EC50 values were calculated with different methods 
and in different experimental settings (e.g. ELISA and FACS) and they were in low nM order. 
Competition with PD-L1 and PD-L2 molecules was also tested with IC50 values of approximatively 
0.5nM. Functional assays showed variable activity but with IC50 or EC50 again in low nM order (0.4-
1.5 nM).  
The activity of tislelizumab was investigated in several in vivo experiments (reports 126-128, 135). 
The experiments include also allogeneic xenograft models of epidermioid carcinoma, colon and lung 
cancers (Studies 126, 127 and 128). In all studies presented treatment with tislelizumab (10mg/kg, i.p 
QW or less) showed a decrease in tumour growth compared to controls. Although, animal survival was 
not an endpoint, in most of the studies tumour regression (not always long lasting) could be noticed in 
some animals (Reports: R01-vivo-127 and 125 colon cancers; R01-vivo-126 epidermoid carcinoma; 
R01-vivo-128 lung cancer). Of note, tumour inoculation had only marginal effect on animal weight and 
no significant difference could be noted between treated animals and controls. 
2.5.3.1.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Since tislelizumab contains mutations to reduce Fc effector functions, several experiments were 
performed to verify a reduced binding to FcγRs and lack of ADCC and CDC activity. 
Dahan et al. 2015 report that Fcγ receptor engagement augments the anti-tumour activity of anti-PD-
L1 antibodies (Abs), but compromises the anti-tumour activity of anti-PD-1 Abs. These findings provide 
rationale for Fc engineering of these Abs to optimize anti-tumour efficacy. Lack of binding of 
tislelizumab to FcγR as compared to pembrolizumab and nivolumab was demonstrated in vitro. These 
interactions between anti-PD-1 antibodies with competent Fc have shown to significantly reduce their 
therapeutic efficacy for cancer treatment, likely due to the killing of T cells by antibody-mediated 
effector functions (such as ADCC). However, how this would pan out in a disease animal model is not 
known. Therefore, a comparative study with Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab in an animal model to 
determine the lack of antibody effector function in vivo would have been supportive of the nonclinical 
proof of concept of tislelizumab.

2.5.3.2.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology parameters were assessed during the toxicology studies, please refer to the 
Toxicology section. 
2.5.3.3.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic interactions studies were submitted as part of this application. 
2.5.4.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  PK  behaviour  of  tislelizumab  was  investigated  after  single  or  repeat  intravenous  infusion 
administration to cynomolgus monkeys. The study P14-057-YD included three groups with single dose 
administrations  of  3/10/30  mg/kg  tislelizumab  and  one  group  with  repeat-dose  administration  of 
tislelizumab 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks with a total of five doses. There was no control group 
in this study. In the single dose groups, Cmax and exposure increased dose-proportionally. In the repeat-
dose group, some accumulation could be noticed between d1 and d289, at least in male animals. Slight 
differences in PK parameters between female and male animals were observed. ADA were detected in 
the vast majority of the animals with possible impact on tislelizumab concentration.  
Toxicokinetics: In the single dose study in monkeys, tislelizumab Cmax and AUC increased slightly more 
than dose-proportionally. T ½ ranged from 7-11 days, approximatively. In the first 13-week repeat-dose 
study  in  monkeys  (P14-057-CD),  tislelizumab  Cmax  and  AUC  increased  approximatively  dose 
proportional at day 1. Slight accumulation between d1, d29 and d71 could be seen in the mid and high 
dose groups. In the second 13-week repeat-dose study in monkeys (2270246), tislelizumab Cmax and 
AUC increased approximatively dose proportional at day 1. Light accumulation between d1 and d71 could 
be  seen  especially  in  male  animals.  Serum  exposure  in  male  and  female  monkeys  was  generally 
comparable after a single dose on Day 1 across the two IV dose groups. Serum exposure to tislelizumab 
in female monkeys was generally lower compared with those measured for male monkeys after repeated 
once every two weeks IV bolus doses on Day 71 across the two IV dose groups. 
Distribution 
No specific tissue-cross reactivity with tislelizumab was noted in cynomolgus monkey or human tissues. 
(study Nos O14-057-2ZJ and O14-057-1ZJ).A Retrogenix assay, was also performed, please refer to the 
section “other toxicity studies” 2.5.5.8..   
Metabolism and excretion 
No metabolism and excretion studies were submitted as part of this application.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
As there is minimal involvement of the cytochrome P450 system in the metabolism of monoclonal 
antibodies it is endorsed that no in vitro drug interaction studies with tislelizumab are conducted.

2.5.5.  Toxicology 
2.5.5.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The Applicant performed a single-dose toxicology study in the non relevant species mice (M14-057-
JD), where 0/30/100 mg/kg tislelizumab was administered IV once to 10 female and 10 male 
animals/group and followed by a 28-day recovery period. The following parameters were analysed: 
clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, upon necropsy: macroscopic evaluation (gross 
findings), and no sign of toxicity was observed. No TK analysis was performed so the exposure is not 
known in this study.  
Moreover, the Applicant performed a single-dose toxicology study in monkeys (P14-057-JD), where 
0/10/30/100 mg/kg tislelizumab was administered IV once to one female and one male animal/group 
and followed by a 28-day recovery period. The Applicant did not observe any sign of toxicity and set 
the MTD at 100mg/kg. ADA were detected in about 50% of the animals. 
2.5.5.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The  Applicant  performed  a  first  repeat-dose  toxicology  study  in  monkeys  (P14-057-CD),  where 
0/3/10/30 mg/kg tislelizumab was administered IV once biweekly for 13 weeks to 6 animals/sex/group 
followed by a 6-week recovery period (The first 4 monkeys/sex/group were euthanized after 13-week of 
dosing on Day 91 and the remaining 2 monkeys/sex/group were euthanized on Day 133) following a 6-
week  recovery  period.  No  sign  of  toxicity  was  observed  and  the  NOAEL  was  set  at  30  mg/kg.  Safety 
pharmacology  parameters  were  incorporated  in  the  toxicology  studies  and  no  effects  were  noted  on 
parameters evaluating respiratory, neural or cardiovascular system. Results of an additional repeat-dose 
toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys were submitted during the procedure. Doses of 0/30/60 mg/kg 
tislelizumab was administered IV once every two weeks for 13 weeks to 3 animals/sex/group or as two 
single doses (14 days apart to 3 males only) via subcutaneous injection (SQ). No sign of toxicity was 
observed at 30mg/kg, which was confirmed to be the NOAEL.  However, in the 60 mg/kg IV group, a 
female had to be euthanised early at day 31. The causes were possibly attributed to immunogenicity. 
2.5.5.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were submitted as part of this application. 
2.5.5.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted as part of this application. 
2.5.5.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No dedicated in vivo reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were submitted as part of this 
application. The applicant submitted a literature review on the effects of PD-1/PD-L1 on embryo-foetal 
toxicity. The risk-assessment highlighted the important role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axes in pregnancy and 
foetal loss. Tislelizumab may cause foetal harm, increase rates of abortion or stillbirth or altering the 
normal immune response in foetuses if administered to a pregnant woman. Moreover, the effects of 
PD-1/PD-L1 on prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function, suggest that 
inhibition of PD-1/PD-L pathway during pregnancy may cause or potentiate autoimmune diseases in 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023

infants. Examination of reproductive organs was performed during the 13-week repeat dose study, 
where no findings were reported. 
2.5.5.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
See section 2.5.4. 
2.5.5.7.  Tolerance 
Local tolerance endpoints were included in the repeated dose toxicity study and no findings were 
reported. 
2.5.5.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Other  in  vitro  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  order  to  evaluate  tislelizumab  antigenicity, 
immunotoxicity and potential to induce cytokine release.  
The Applicant performed two tissue cross-reactivity studies on 30 human normal tissues (O14-057-1ZJ) 
and 30 monkey normal tissues (O14-057-2ZJ). The GLP TCR studies submitted in the original application 
were not considered GLP compliant therefore the study results were replaced with Retrogenix assay The 
Applicant performed a Retrogenix assay showing binding of tislelizumab to PD-1 on fixed and live human 
cells  (HEK293  transfectants).  The  positive  signals  were  further  verified  by  FACS.  Although  for 
tislelizumab an Ab concentration much higher than the one of the positive control Rituximab was used 
(20µg/ml versus 1µg/ml respectively), the signal appears to be strong and specific. The results of the 
Retrogenix  assay  identified  a  specific,  although  weak,  off-target  binding  to  TREML1,  which  was  not 
sufficiently  addressed  in  the  current  answer  and  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  further  investigate.  In 
response, the Applicant provided an additional study investigating the potential binding of tislelizumab 
to TREML-1 via SPR. Two different assay formats were tested, one format had the antigen in solution 
(monovalent format) the other format had the antigen bound to the surface (avid format). None of the 
formats could confirm tislelizumab binding to TREML-1. Of note, the respective positive controls resulted 
in  positive  signals,  as  expected.  Therefore,  the  Applicant’s  conclusion  that  “it is  unlikely  that  VDT482 
shows  significant  competition  against  the  natural  ligand  of  TREML1  and  thus  the  weak  interaction 
observed in the Retrogenix in vitro assay is not expected to have any physiological implication.“ is found 
acceptable.  
2.5.6.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has provided a justification for not performing an environmental risk assessment. As 
tislelizumab is a protein composed of natural amino acids, proteins are expected to biodegrade in the 
environment and not pose a significant risk. Therefore, tislelizumab is exempt from preparation of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as per the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.5.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 variant antibody derived from a murine hybridoma clone. The 
proposed mode of action consists in binding to the check-point molecule PD-1, blocking its signal 
transduction and consequently enhancing immune cell functions, possibly leading to inhibition of 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 28/165 
 
  
 
 
tumour growth in vivo. Tislelizumab has been mutated in the Fc region, in order to minimise the 
binding to Fc gamma receptors. 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided evidence that tislelizumab can bind to PD-1 
receptor and can prevent the interaction with PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, avoiding PD-1-mediated 
inhibitory signalling. Although most experiments were performed in very artificial conditions using 
transfectants and complex cell-based assays, the Applicant appropriately addressed the question 
raised. Importantly, in the responses, the Applicant provided additional figures showing a weak 
positive staining for PD-1 on resting T cells and an increase of the positive population in the same 
donor following stimulation, as expected. This is considered an important proof that tislelizumab is able 
to bind to naïve PD-1 and together with the new data (from the Retrogenix assay) contributes to clear 
up the doubts about tislelizumab possible insufficient binding. In several experiments, the Applicant 
compared tislelizumab binding or activity to other anti-PD-1 mAbs such as nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab. Most of the results seem to indicate at least equal performance of tislelizumab, but 
the variability of the methods and missing statistical analysis do not allow a conclusive statement on 
the comparison.  
Lack of binding of tislelizumab to FcγR as compared to pembrolizumab and nivolumab was 
demonstrated in vitro. These interactions between anti-PD-1 antibodies with competent Fc have shown 
to significantly reduce their therapeutic efficacy for cancer treatment, likely due to the killing of T cells 
by antibody-mediated effector functions (such as ADCC). However, how this would pan out in a disease 
animal model is not known. Therefore, a comparative study with Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab in an 
animal model to determine the lack of antibody effector function in vivo would have been supportive of 
the non-clinical proof of concept of tislelizumab. In vivo studies using murine xenograft tumour models 
and human PBMCs showed tislelizumab efficacy against several tumour cell lines.  
The pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab were assessed in cynomolgus monkeys in a single-dose PK study 
and in an initial repeat-dose toxicity study after IV administration. This is appropriate as it reflects the 
clinical route of administration. ADA were detected in most of the animals and determined to be mostly 
neutralising. An impact on Cmax and AUC was evident especially in the low dose group and potentially 
also on AUC for the mid and high-dose group, nevertheless exposure was still present. Overall, these 
studies indicate that tislelizumab has pharmacokinetics typical for a mAb.  Although for none of the 
newly developed validation methods GLP compliance was claimed, the new methods are considered fit 
for purpose and suitable to be used in support of the pivotal GLP toxicology study. 
Of note a REC has been made, since the Applicant committed to communicate the results of the long-
term stability study for the bioassay samples (stability of tislelizumab in monkey serum), by 
amendment to the PK bioanalysis method (BAL-22-031-1470 REP). 
As tislelizumab is expected to be degraded to small peptides and individual amino acids, the omission 
of metabolism and excretion studies is supported.  
The toxicity of tislelizumab was assessed in several studies in cynomolgus monkeys, the relevant 
species.  
The GLP TCR studies submitted in the original application were not considered GLP compliant therefore 
the study results were replaced with Retrogenix assay Given the totality of evidence presented, the 
validity and the GLP compliance of the two TCR studies was questioned and a GLP inspection triggered. 
The Applicant was asked to answer the various criticisms presented above and to perform the studies 
again, selecting a more adequate positive control (e.g. tissue slides with inflamed tonsils). The 
Applicant preferred to perform a Retrogenix assay instead.  Results from this assay show binding to 
tislelizumab to PD-1 on fixed and live human cells (HEK293 transfectants). The positive signals were 
further verified by FACS. Although for tislelizumab an Ab concentration much higher than the one of 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 29/165 
 
  
 
 
the positive control Rituximab was used (20µg/ml versus 1µg/ml respectively), the signal appears to 
be strong and specific. These results, together with the data provided for answer 45 contribute to clear 
up the doubts about tislelizumab possible insufficient binding. The major objection is therefore 
considered solved. However, the results of the Retrogenix assay identified a specific, although weak, 
off-target binding to TREML1, which was not sufficiently addressed in the current answer and the 
Applicant was asked to further investigate. In response, the Applicant provided an additional study 
investigating the potential binding of tislelizumab to TREML-1 via SPR. Two different assay formats 
were tested, one format had the antigen in solution (monovalent format), the other format had the 
antigen bound to the surface (avid format). None of the formats could confirm tislelizumab binding to 
TREML-1. Of note, the respective positive controls resulted in positive signals, as expected. Therefore, 
the Applicant’s conclusion that “it is unlikely that VDT482 shows significant competition against the 
natural ligand of TREML1 and thus the weak interaction observed in the Retrogenix in vitro assay is not 
expected to have any physiological implication“ is found acceptable.  
In repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys with intravenous dose administration for 
13 weeks at doses of 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 13 weeks (7 dose administrations), no 
apparent treatment-related toxicity or histopathological changes were observed at doses up to 
30 mg/kg every 2 weeks, corresponding to 4.3 to 6.6 times the exposure in humans with the clinical 
dose of 200 mg.  
Importantly, despite the Applicant declared the pivotal toxicology study as GLP-compliant, the outcome 
of the triggered GLP inspection was negative.  The Applicant acknowledged this conclusion and 
proposed several actions to mitigate the negative inspection outcome. In particular, the Applicant 
communicated the initiation of a new in vivo 13-week repeat dose toxicology study for tislelizumab in 
an OECD-GLP-compliant facility. Although this new in vivo study was not requested by the CHMP its 
results needed to be evaluated within the totality of data. Considering the new study results confirming 
the NOAEL at 30mg/kg, the results of additional tests confirming the specific binding of tislelizumab to 
PD-1, the well-known target and that “nonclinical toxicity studies in nonhuman primates have been 
poor in predicting clinical toxicities for antibodies mediating immune checkpoint blockade (Wang et al 
2014)” the GLP and the specificity findings have been resolved. 
In conclusion, in repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys with intravenous dose 
administration for 13 weeks at doses of 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 13 weeks (7 dose 
administrations), no apparent treatment-related toxicity or histopathological changes were observed at 
doses up to 30 mg/kg every 2 weeks, corresponding to 4.3 to 6.6 times the exposure in humans with 
the clinical dose of 200 mg.  
Other in vitro toxicity studies were performed in order to evaluate tislelizumab antigenicity, 
immunotoxicity and potential to induce cytokine release. Beside the potential of tislelizumab to induce 
neutralising ADA and to possibly induce an enhanced recall response to the re-challenge antigen, no 
other toxicities were detected. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with tislelizumab. In line 
with ICH S9, omission of fertility/early embryonic development studies and of pre-/post-natal 
development studies is accepted. A weight of evidence approach, as outlined in ICH S6(R1) was 
applied to describe the potential risk of tislelizumab to human pregnancy, which is acceptable. Given 
the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in maintaining materno-fetal tolerance, treatment with 
tislelizumab during pregnancy may lead to abortion or still births. This risk is reflected in the SmPC. No 
developmental and reproductive toxicity studies or animal fertility studies have been conducted with 
tislelizumab. 
No studies have been performed to assess the potential of tislelizumab for carcinogenicity or 
genotoxicity in line with ICH guideline S9. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023

Regarding ecotoxicity, the active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, considering the above 
data, tislelizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.8.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the Applicant performed an adequate package of in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies with 
tislelizumab.  A  study  specific  GLP-inspection  was  triggered  for  studies  P14-057-CD  (13-week  repeat-
dose  toxicity  in  monkeys),  O14-057-2ZJ  (TCR  in  monkey  tissues)  and  O14-057-1ZJ  (TCR  in  human 
tissues) because of doubts about the plausibility of the results reported in the respective study reports 
and the negative inspection history of the facility. A remote inspection was performed from 14/11/2022 
to  18/11/2022.  The  final  inspection  report,  dated  20/01/2023,  indicated  several  critical  and  major 
findings  and  declared  all  the  three  studies  as  non-OECD-GLP-compliant.  The  Applicant  acknowledged 
this conclusion and proposed several actions to mitigate the negative inspection outcome. In particular, 
the  Applicant  communicated  the  initiation  of  a  new  in  vivo  13-week  repeat-dose  toxicology  study  for 
tislelizumab in an OECD-GLP-compliant facility. Although this new in vivo study was not requested by 
the CHMP its results needed to be evaluated within the totality of data. Therefore, the Applicant provided 
the  final  report  of  the  additional  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  as  requested. 
Considering  the  new  study  results  confirming  the  NOAEL  at  30mg/kg,  the  results  of  additional  tests 
confirming  the  specific  binding  of  tislelizumab  to  PD-1,  the  well-known  target  and  that  “nonclinical 
toxicity  studies  in  nonhuman  primates  have  been  poor  in  predicting  clinical  toxicities  for  antibodies 
mediating immune checkpoint blockade (Wang et al 2014)”.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical studies that contributed to the characterization of the clinical pharmacology properties of 
tislelizumab are presented in Table 1-1. Dose ranges from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 2 and 5 mg/kg Q3W, 
and 200 mg Q3W, all administered as intravenous infusions over 30 to 60 minutes were studied. 
Sparse PK samples were collected in Phase I, II, and III studies that tested the recommended dose of 
200 mg Q3W. PK data from the studies presented in Table 1-1 were also used in the popPK analysis 
and to characterize ER relationships.

The number of patients by age group for the 12 studies of the PopPK dataset is provided in the table 
below. 
Analytical methods 
Two quantitative indirect enzyme immunoassay methods were validated and used for measurement of 
tislelizumab in human serum. The first analytical laboratory method in serum was developed and fully 
validated at Australia CPR Pharma Service (VAL136). This method was then transferred to Covance and 
fully validated at their Shanghai laboratory (8354-363). In addition, a formal cross-validation has been 
performed to verify that PK data obtained at different laboratories (method VAL136 and method 8354-
363) are reliable and comparable. 
A validated antidrug antibody (ADA) electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay utilizing the Meso 
Scale Discovery (MSD) technology was used for determination of anti-tislelizumab antibodies in human 
serum from clinical studies. Detection of ADAs was performed in 3 steps: a screening assay; a 
confirmation assay and a titration assay to estimate the level of antibody in confirmed positive 
samples.  
A validated competitive ECL ligand-binding assay utilizing MSD technology was applied for detection of 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to tislelizumab. 
PK data analysis 
In the early studies (BGB-A317-001 and BGB-A317-102), PK parameters were derived using standard 
noncompartmental methods with WinNonlin Professional or SAS®. 
In addition, a popPK model was developed from the full PK analysis dataset consisting of 12 studies 
(Studies 001, 102, 203, 204, 205, 206, 208, 209, 302, 303, 304, and 307, see Table 1-1 above) to

quantitatively describe the PK properties of tislelizumab and identify sources of interindividual 
variability. 
A 3-compartment model with first order elimination from the central compartment, and redistribution 
into the peripheral compartments best characterised tislelizumab PK following IV administration (Figure 
3). 
Parameter estimates for the final PopPK model for tislelizumab are presented in Table 11. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 35/165 
 
  
 
 
 
In Amendment 1 to the popPK report, discrepancies regarding the baseline body weight of two subjects 
from BGB-A317-302 study were corrected and PK parameters were re-estimated using the final PopPK 
model and the updated PopPK dataset with corrected weights. The estimated PK parameters using 
updated dataset were almost identical to those reported in the original PopPK report, with some minor 
differences in second decimal place. 
Evaluation and Qualification of popPK model  
The final PopPK model was evaluated with multiple model qualification/validation methods, including 
goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC), numerical predictive 
check (NPC), bootstrap, and shrinkage assessments. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 36/165 
 
  
 
 
 
The general goodness-of-fit plots of the final PopPK model are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, where a 
good agreement between the predicted concentrations and the observed concentrations was observed 
and no apparent bias was observed in the residuals plots over time and across predicted 
concentrations. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 37/165 
 
  
 
 
 
The ability of the final popPK model to reproduce the distribution of the tislelizumab concentration data 
over time was evaluated using pcVPC based on 1000 simulated replicates of the original dataset. The 
pcVPC plots showed that the observed median, 2.5th and 97.5th %tiles of the concentration-time 
profiles were generally contained within the simulation-based 95% confidence intervals for the 
corresponding model predicted median and 2.5th and 97.5th %tiles. These results suggest that the 
final popPK model adequately predicted the central tendency and variability of the serum tislelizumab 
concentrations following IV administration.

Absorption  
In study 001, noncompartmental PK analysis revealed a Cmax after the first dose of tislelizumab (200 
mg Q3W) of 76.1 µg/mL. In Cycle 4 or Cycle 5, Cmax was determined to be 89.5 µg/mL. In study 102, 
Cmax in Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 was determined to be 66.5 µg/mL and 126 µg/mL, respectively. 
The estimate for steady-state Cmax derived by population PK analysis was 110 μg/mL. 
100% bioavailability is expected as tislelizumab is administered by iv infusion. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023

Distribution 
Noncompartmental analysis: 
In study 102, gemotric mean VSS (Cycle 5) was determined to be 4.04 L. 
Population PK analysis: 
The steady-state volume of distribution is 6.42 L. Vc, V2, and V3 were estimated to be 3.05 L, 1.27 L, 
and 2.10 L, respectively. 
Elimination 
Noncompartmental analysis: 
After 200 mg intravenous tislelizumab dosing, mean CL determined in Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 of study 001 
were 0.186 and 0.242 L/day. The apparent terminal t½ estimated in Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 was 15.9 
days and 14.9 days, respectively. 
In study 102, clearance values determined in Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 after dosing with 200 mg 
tislelizumab Q3W were 0.233 and 0.186 L/day, respectively. The apparent half-lives (t½ values) 
estimated in Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 were 12.9 and 16.6 days, respectively.  
Population PK analysis: 
The geometric mean elimination half-life was estimated to be 23.8 days with a coefficient variation 
(CV) of 31%. Clearance was estimated to be 0.153 L/day with an inter-individual variability of 26.3%. 
Tislelizumab as monoclonal antibody is metabolized by protein catabolism via the reticuloendothelial 
system or target-mediated disposition. Due to its large molecular size, renal excretion of intact 
tislelizumab is unlikely. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study 001, drug exposure (Cmax and AUC0-14d) increased in a dose-proportional manner from 0.5 
mg/kg to 10 mg/kg both after the first dose administration and at Cycle 4/5, corresponding to steady 
state. 
The accumulation indices in study 001 were 1.21 and 1.60 determined by the ratio of steady-state and 
first dose of Cmax and AUC0-tau, respectively. In study 102, the accumulation index ranged between 
1.87 and 2.13 determined by PK exposures (ratio of steady-state and first dose of AUC0-tau, Cmax, 
and predose Ctrough). Referring to the population PK analysis, the accumulation ratios are 2.14, 1.62, 
and 2.49 for AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss. 
PK in target population 
Study BGB-A317-302 (Study 302) 
A Randomized, Controlled, Open-label, Global Phase 3 Study Comparing the Efficacy of the Anti-PD-1 
Antibody Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) Versus Chemotherapy as Second Line Treatment in Patients with 
Advanced Unresectable/Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma. 
A total of 255 patients received tislelizumab at a dose of 200 mg administered intravenously Q3W. 
Study treatment was administered until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or another treatment 
discontinuation criterion was met. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 40/165 
 
  
 
 
As of the data cutoff date, geometric means of predose (Cycle 1, 2, 5, 9, and 17) and postdose (Cycle 
1 and 5) serum concentrations after the intravenous doses of tislelizumab 200 mg Q3W, stratified by 
regions up to Cycle 17, are presented in Table 2-9. A total of 254 patients were included in the PK data 
analysis set, one patient was excluded from the PK summary. The serum concentrations observed in 
the ESCC patients from this study were generally consistent with those observed in patients from other 
studies after receiving treatment with tislelizumab at 200 mg Q3W. Results in the Asia and 
Europe/North America subgroups were similar and consistent with those of the overall population. 
PK in special populations 
In the population PK model, baseline body weight, albumin level, tumour size of solid tumours, ADA 
status (treatment-emergent ADA), and tumour type were identified as significant covariates on CL. 
Baseline body weight, sex, and age were identified as significant covariates on Vc.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023

Impaired renal function 
Renal function was not identified as a significant covariate. No dedicated studies of tislelizumab have 
been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the population PK analyses of tislelizumab, no 
clinically relevant differences in the clearance of tislelizumab were found between patients with mild 
renal impairment (CLCr 60 to 89 ml/min, n = 1 046) or moderate renal impairment (CLCr 30 to 59 
ml/min, n = 320) and patients with normal renal function (CLCr ≥90 ml/min, n = 1 223) (Figure 3-5).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 42/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Impaired hepatic function 
No dedicated studies of tislelizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. The 
liver function laboratory tests (AST, ALT, or total bilirubin) were not found to be significant covariates 
on tislelizumab PK in the popPK analysis. The mean simulated exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss and 
Cmin,ss) in mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment were up to 8.71% lower, 15.4% lower, and 
9.12% lower, respectively, compared with those of subjects with normal hepatic function. Comparing 
popPK model-predicted exposures between different impairment groups, no clinically relevant effect of 
hepatic function was noticeable on the PK of tislelizumab (Figure 3-6).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 43/165 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Gender 
Gender was found to be a significant covariate on the Vc (volume of distribution in the central 
compartment). The typical Vc estimate was 11% lower for female than male patients. The geometric 
mean of simulated exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) in female subjects was 14.7% to 19.0% 
higher compared with those of in male subjects (Figure 3-1).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 44/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Race 
The popPK analysis showed that race was not a significant covariate on the PK parameters (CL and Vc) 
of tislelizumab and had no clinical relevance on tislelizumab PK exposure.  
Subsequent simulations indicated that overall range of tislelizumab exposure after 200 mg Q3W is 
largely overlapped between the Asian and white patients, as shown in Figure 3-3. The simulated 
geometric mean exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) of the Asian patient population (the 
majority of Asian patients are Chinese) from 12 studies were approximately 12% to 21% higher than 
those of white patients.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 45/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Weight 
Body weight was identified as a significant covariate on the CL, and Vc of tislelizumab in the final 
PopPK model. Increased body weight was associated with increased CL and Vc values. Therefore, 
subjects with higher body weight are predicted to have lower exposure. The geometric mean simulated 
exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) in the lowest and highest quartile of body weight were up to 
14.5% higher and 17.3% lower, respectively, compared with those of the overall population (Figure 
16).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 46/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Because body weight was identified as a significant covariate on clearance, simulations were performed 
to compare the exposure produced with the 200 mg Q3W flat dose regimen with those produced with a 
hypothetical 3 mg/kg Q3W body weight based dose to further understand the effect of body-weight 
distribution on dosing. 
The overall difference in geometric means of all summary exposure measures between the two dosing 
scenarios was <4%, with similar variability (% CV) (Table 16). Although predicted exposures were 
higher in patients with lower body weight receiving the flat dosing regimen, the median and 90% 
prediction intervals of tislelizumab summary exposures across the body weight range was maintained 
well within the range of 2 -5 mg/kg Q3W (therapeutic range established in FIH study 001), and well 
below the corresponding median exposures observed with tislelizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, the clinically 
established highest, safe and tolerable dose.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 47/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Additionally, the predicted steady state exposures stratified by body weight quartiles are presented in 
Table 17. The geometric mean simulated exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) in the lowest or 
highest quartile of body weight were up to 14.5% higher and 17.3% lower, respectively, compared 
with those of the overall population.  
Elderly 
Baseline age was identified as a significant covariate on the Vc of tislelizumab in the final popPK model. 
The estimates of Vc at 10th and 90th percentile of age distribution (45 to 71-year-old) were within 3% 
of the typical estimate of Vc at median age of 60. The predicted steady-state exposures after 200 mg 
Q3W dosing for subjects stratified by age groups are presented in Figure 3-4. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 48/165 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Children 
Tislelizumab has no study conducted in pediatric subjects. In the presentation of variability in special 
populations, the Applicant notes in several instances that "These differences were small relative to the 
overall variability of exposures and are not considered clinically significant". The variability values were 
obtained by taking the largest differences between the 5th and 95th percentile exposures in the overall 
population compared to the typical individual, which are ~ 55.8%, 47.3%, and 70.8% for AUC,ss, 
Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss, respectively. Based on the data provided, it is agreed that the variability in the 
special populations is small compared to the overall variability.  
Impact of ADA on PK 
In the Phase III Studies 302, 303, 304, and 307, patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent 
ADA had slightly lower trough tislelizumab concentrations as compared to patients who were ADA 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 49/165 
 
  
 
 
 
negative. However, the serum concentrations in the treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients were 
within the range observed in ADA-negative patients. 
The effect of immunogenicity (ADA) on PK was further evaluated by treatment-emergent ADA status in 
the popPK model. The subject-level ADA status was identified as a significant covariate on the CL of 
tislelizumab in the final PopPK model, where ADA positive status was associated with a slightly 
increased CL compared with ADA negative status. The predicted steady state exposures following 200 
mg Q3W dosing stratified by ADA are presented in Table 21 and Figure 23.  
The geometric mean simulated exposures (AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) in ADA positive subjects were 
up to 20.5% lower compared with those of in ADA negative subjects (Table 21).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tislelizumab. The drug interaction 
potential of tislelizumab is expected to be low based on the nature of therapeutic antibody drugs and 
the knowledge on antibodies of the same class of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. 
Population PK analysis: 
Single or combination therapy was not tested during the PopPK covariate model development because 
multiple chemotherapeutic combination regimens were included in many tumour types (i.e. NPC, GC, 
EC, and NSCLC) and studies (i.e. 205, 206, 304, 307, and 309). The impact of combination therapy on 
the covariate-adjusted tislelizumab PK parameters (CL and Vc) were evaluated in post hoc analysis 
based on the final model are illustrated in Figure 30. The result suggested a significant correlation (p < 
0.0001) between the covariate-adjusted CL and therapy. In order to evaluate the impact of therapy on 
tislelizumab exposure, the predicted steady state exposures following 200 mg Q3W dosing were 
summarized and plotted by therapy (Table 27 and Figure 31). The mean simulated exposures (AUCss, 
Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) in subjects with combotherapy were up to 8.79% higher compared with those of 
subjects with monotherapy in the overall population (Table 27). These differences were very small 
relative to the overall variability of exposures and are not considered clinically significant.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Throughout the clinical studies, no specific pharmacodynamic endpoints were investigated. 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were performed to understand the relationships between PK and 
efficacy, as well as safety parameters. These analyses mainly support the proposed dosing regimen of 
200 mg Q3W.  
The immunogenicity profile of tislelizumab and its impact on PK, safety, and efficacy in the ESCC 
population has been characterized. 
Mechanism of action 
Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody against PD-1, binding to the 
extracellular domain of human PD-1 with high specificity and affinity (KD = 0.15 nM). It competitively 
blocks the binding of both PD-L1 and PD-L2, inhibiting PD-1-mediated negative signaling, and 
enhancing the functional activity in T-cells in in vitro cell-based assays. Tislelizumab does not bind to 
Fc gamma receptors and C1q and therefore does not induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity data are available from 10 clinical studies of tislelizumab administered as a 
monotherapy (Studies 001, 102, 203, 204, 208, 302, and 303) or in combination with chemotherapy 
(Studies 206, 304, and 307) in patients with different tumour types. 
Monitoring of antidrug antibodies (ADA) to tislelizumab and titer determination for confirmed positive 
ADA samples has been performed. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were evaluated in the confirmed 
positive ADA samples. 
Tislelizumab monotherapy 
Among 1424 evaluable patients treated with tislelizumab 200 mg Q3W as monotherapy, 232 (16.3%) 
had treatment-emergent ADA, of which 224 (15.7%) had treatment-induced ADA, and 8 (0.6%) had 
treatment-boosted ADA, and 11 (0.6%) had neutralizing antibodies (Table 5-3). 
Tislelizumab combination therapy 
Among 492 evaluable patients treated with tislelizumab 200 mg Q3W in combination with platinum-
containing chemotherapy (Studies 206, 304, and 307), 118 (24.0%) had treatment-emergent ADA, of 
whom 114 (23.2%) had treatment-induced ADA and 4 (0.8%) had treatment-boosted ADA, and 7 
(1.4%) had NAb (Table 5-3).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 54/165 
 
  
 
 
Higher ADA incidence rates were observed in White vs. Asian patients (21.0% vs. 14.3%) and also in 
Europe/North America vs. Asia (24.4% vs. 15.2%), although exposure-response analyses revealed 
that the difference in ADA incidence rates between White and Asian patients is not associated with 
altered clinical efficacy and safety. 
Onset and duration 
The onset and duration of treatment-induced, persistent, and transient ADA were comparable across 
the studies (Table 5-9). Most patients with treatment-induced ADA, persistent or transient, developed 
the ADA by the second dose (Cycle 2 Day 1; Study Day 22 ± 4 days) and before the third dose of the 
Q3W regimen (Table 5-9).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 55/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Median titer levels 
The median titer levels generally fluctuated between 10 and 100 over time. Higher titers ≥1000 were 
observed in some patients in Studies 304 and 307 at isolated timelines during treatment with 
tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy.  
Individual titer values for most patients did not increase over the course of the studies.

To further estimate the causal treatment effects on survival in subgroups defined based on a post-
baseline variable, the principal stratum strategy was applied to the primary endpoint of OS in Studies 
302 and 303, and PFS in Studies 304 and 307. Comparable survival benefits favouring tislelizumab 
arm compared to the adjusted control arm were observed in both ADA-positive and ADA-negative 
subgroups of the Phase III studies, confirming the lack of causal impact of ADA on survival (data not 
shown). 
The impact of transient versus persistent ADA response as well as Nab positivity on evaluated efficacy 
parameters were investigated (data not shown). 
Impact of ADA on safety 
Overall, the incidence of immune-mediated AEs and AESIs (comprising immune-mediated AEs and 
infusion-related reactions) were comparable between patients who developed ADA and those who 
tested negative for ADA. AEs causing treatment discontinuation or dose modification also showed no 
notable differences by ADA status. There was no apparent relationship between AEs and ADA titers in 
ADA-positive patients, with most AEs occurring in patients with low titers <40 or <80. 
A higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs in treatment-emergent ADA-positive patients compared with ADA-
negative patients was observed in all studies, with the exception of Study 307 which showed similar 
incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs in the two ADA subgroups (Table 5-14).  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 63/165 
 
  
 
 
 
The imbalance in Grade ≥ 3 AEs observed between the ADA subgroups was driven mainly by Grade 3 
AEs, of which the majority in both ADA subgroups were considered not related to study treatment. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 64/165 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Across all Phase III studies, the Grade ≥ 3 events had no impact on the continuation of tislelizumab as 
confirmed by the comparable rates of AEs leading to discontinuation between the ADA subgroups. In 
general, there was no obvious temporal association between Grade ≥ 3 AEs and ADA onset (although 
limited by sparse ADA sampling), no correlation between toxicity grade and ADA titer, and no clinically 
relevant relationships between tislelizumab exposure and safety endpoints. Importantly, immune-
mediated AEs and infusion-related reactions, which may be potentially attributable to ADA, showed no 
differences between treatment-emergent ADA positive and ADA-negative patients.  
Upon request, treatment-emergent AEs by ADA status in a pooled dataset for patients treated with 
tislelizumab monotherapy at a dose of 200 mg Q3W and pooled for the combination therapy studies 
were provided separately for immune-mediated AEs, IRRs, Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs causing 
treatment discontinuation/dose modification. The ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups had 
comparable rates of immune-mediated AEs, IRRs, AEs causing treatment discontinuation and AEs 
causing dose modification, while the ADA-positive group showed higher rates of Grade ≥ 3 AEs (50.9% 
vs. 39.3% for monotherapy and 85.6% vs. 78.2% for combination therapy) and SAEs (37.1% vs. 
29.7% for monotherapy and 45.9% vs. 38.2% for combination therapy). 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs in monotherapy studies 
In the pooled monotherapy studies, the following SOCs showed numerical differences >2% between 
the treatment-emergent ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups: 
• 
Investigations SOC (12.9% vs. 10.3%), with PTs that were generally low and comparable 
between the ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups. 
•  Metabolism and nutrition disorders (11.6% vs. 7.3%), with small differences of 1-2% 
between ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups in PTs of hyponatremia (4.3% vs. 2.0%) and 
hypokalemia (2.6% vs. 1.3%). 
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders (9.9% vs. 5.3%), with small differences of 1-3% in 
anemia (7.8% vs. 4.2%) and thrombocytopenia (1.3% vs. 0%). 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (9.1% vs. 5.7%), with no single PT driving this difference. 
•  General disorders and administrative site conditions (6.5% vs. 3.9%), with no single PT 
driving this difference. 
•  Hepatobiliary disorders (4.7% vs. 2.1%), with PTs that occurred at very low and comparable 
rates (≤0.9% in either ADA group). 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs in combination therapy studies 
In the pooled combination therapy studies, the following SOCs showed numerical differences >2% 
between the treatment-emergent ADA-positive and ADA-negative: 
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders (53.2% vs. 44.2%), mainly driven by anemia (21.6% 
vs. 13.0%), leukopenia (18.9% vs. 14.8%) and thrombocytopenia (13.5% vs. 9.7%), and 
febrile neutropenia (4.5% vs. 1.8%). These hematological events are common with 
chemotherapy and the majority of such events were considered related to the chemotherapy 
rather than to tislelizumab [Study 304-Table 14.3.1.2.5.3], [Study 307- Table 14.3.1-2.5.3]. 
• 
Infections and infestations (15.3% vs. 8.2%), mainly due to pneumonia (9.0% vs. 3.9%). In 
the overall populations of the NSCLC studies, Grade ≥3 pneumonia occurred with comparable 
rates between tislelizumab + chemotherapy and chemotherapy arms [Study 304-Table 
14.3.1-2.4.2], [Study 307-Table 14.3.1.2.4.2]. 
•  Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (10.8% vs. 8.2%), with a small difference 
seen in hemoptysis (3.6% vs. 1.2%). 
•  Metabolism and nutrition disorders (9.9% vs. 6.7%), with small differences seen in decreased 
appetite (2.7% vs. 1.2%) and hypokalemia (2.7% vs. 0.9%). 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 65/165 
 
  
 
 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (4.5% vs. 2.4%), with a small difference 
seen in malaise (2.7% vs. 0.3%). 
SAEs in monotherapy studies 
In the pooled monotherapy studies, the following SOCs showed numerical differences >2% between 
the treatment-emergent ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups: 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (9.1% vs. 4.5%), with differences in dysphagia (2.2% vs. 0.5%) 
and diarrhea (1.3% vs. 0.1%). All other PTs occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in either group. 
•  Hepatobiliary disorders (3.9% vs. 1.8%), with PTs that occurred at very low and comparable 
rates  
(≤0.9% in either ADA group). 
SAEs in combination therapy studies 
In the pooled combination therapy studies, the following SOCs showed numerical differences >2% 
between the treatment-emergent ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups: 
•  Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (17.1% vs. 11.2%), driven primarily by 
pneumonitis (8.1% vs. 5.2%) and hemoptysis (5.4% vs. 1.2%). Pneumonitis is a known 
imAE of immune checkpoint inhibitors (Wu et al 2017) and was more common in the 
tislelizumab + chemotherapy arm vs. chemotherapy arm in the NSCLC studies: 5.9% T+PP 
vs. 0.9% PP [Study 304-Table 27], and 2.5% T+PC, 1.7% T+nPC vs. 0% PC [Study 307-
Table 25]. 
• 
Infections and infestations (12.6% vs. 7.9%), driven by pneumonia (9.0% vs. 5.5%). In the 
overall populations of the NSCLC studies, the incidence of serious pneumonia was comparable 
between tislelizumab + chemotherapy and chemotherapy arms [Study 304- Table 27], [Study 
307-Table 25]. 
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders (10.8% vs. 4.8%), with differences in 
thrombocytopenia (4.5% vs. 1.5%) and anemia (3.6% vs. 0.3%). 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (6.3% vs. 3.3%) due mainly to malaise 
(1.8% vs. 0%). 
•  Cardiac disorders (3.6% vs. 0.9%), with all PTs occurring as single events (≤0.9% in either 
ADA group). 
•  Skin and connective tissue disorders (2.7% vs. 0.6%) due mainly to rash (1.8% vs. 0%). 
•  Hepatobiliary disorders which were more common in the ADA-negative group (2.1%) than in 
the ADA-positive group (0%). 
Most SOCs and PTs of SAEs listed above are not known to be mediated by ADA. On the other hand, 
ADA-related immune complexes have been shown to induce release of inflammatory cytokines and 
complement activation, leading to inflammation and breakdown of self-tolerance (Krishna and Nadler 
2016). While it is unclear what role, if any, ADA may play in the pathogenesis of imAEs such as 
pneumonitis, the incidence of pneumonitis in tislelizumab studies in NSCLC is similar to those reported 
for other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, including nivolumab and atezolizumab which have comparable or 
higher ADA incidences as tislelizumab (Wu et al 2017, Rittmeyer et al 2017). 
The majority of the 18 patients with NAb (0.8% of 2277 ADA evaluable patients; Table 5-3) across the 
10 clinical studies did not experience immune-mediated AEs or AESIs, and none had hypersensitivity 
AEs. 
Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-efficacy analysis: 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 66/165 
 
  
 
 
Exposure-OS Analysis: Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by quartiles of model-predicted 
Cavg,dose1 for tislelizumab-treated subjects (N = 254) showed that subjects in the highest exposure 
quartile had longer OS compared to subjects in the lower exposure quartiles (Figure 3-8 [1]). To 
further investigate the relationship between exposure and OS, a Cox proportional hazards model 
analysis was performed using Cavg,dose1, baseline subject characteristics (tumour size, ECOG 
Performance Status score, albumin level, LDH, AST, ALT, bilirubin, eGFR, ADA status, PDL1, age, 
weight, race, and sex) and tumour growth rate. This Cox regression analysis results showed that 
albumin, tumour growth rate, and tislelizumab Cavg,dose1 were significant predictors for OS (p < 
0.01) (Figure 3-8 [2]). 
Since tislelizumab exposure appeared to have a significant effect on OS, 2 sensitivity analyses were 
performed using the OS data from the (1) Tislelizumab Arm only and (2) both Tislelizumab and Control 
(ICC) Arms against exposure as a categorical variable (quartiles). Both sensitivity analyses identified 
albumin level, tumour growth rate, and the highest exposure quartile as significant predictors of OS 
(Figure 3-9). These analyses also showed that the effect on OS is not consistent across the exposure 
quartiles as the lowest exposure quartile had a smaller hazard ratio compared to the second and third 
exposure quartiles. 
Further analysis of the OS data from Study 302 identified confounding baseline factors and imbalances 
in prognostic factors favouring subjects in the highest exposure quartile. For instance, longer OS was 
observed in subjects with smaller baseline tumour size, higher baseline albumin level and the 
imbalances in distribution of these factors favouring the highest exposure quartile over the lowest 
exposure quartile are presented in Figure 3-10. Of note, albumin and baseline tumour size were also 
significant covariates on tislelizumab clearance, which indicates that exposure is not an independent 
variable and the observed E-R relationship is likely confounded by these baseline disease-related 
factors. 
There is no meaningful association between the exposure and efficacy across the exposures evaluated 
in Study 302 population.

Exposure-ORR Analysis: Analysis of exposure with the secondary endpoint of ORR showed that the 
range of tislelizumab exposure values was similar between responders (subjects with objective 
response, N = 52) and non-responders (N = 184) in Study 302. The mean tislelizumab Cavg,dose1 
was 30.3 ± 4.30 μg/mL in responders compared with 29.0 ± 5.16 μg/mL in non-responders, 
respectively (Figure 3-11).

Exposure-safety analysis: 
No consistent and clinically relevant ER relationship was observed between tislelizumab exposure 
metrics and the safety endpoints of probability of any AEs ≥ Grade 3, imAEs, AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, IRRs, AESIs, AEs leading to dose modification, and SAEs among tislelizumab-treated 
subjects (N = 254) in Study 302 (Figure 3-15 and Figure 3-16).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package of tislelizumab comprised 12 clinical studies contributing to the 
characterization of tislelizumab pharmacokinetics. Doses ranging from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 2 and 5 
mg/kg Q3W, and 200 mg Q3W, all administered as intravenous infusions over 30 to 60 minutes, were 
investigated. 
The proposed dosing regimen for tislelizumab is 200 mg administered IV once every 3 weeks. 
Analytical methods 
For the quantitation of tislelizumab concentrations, a quantitative indirect ELISA method was 
developed and validated. A formal cross-validation has been performed to verify that PK data obtained 
at different laboratories (method VAL136 and method 8354-363) are reliable and comparable.  
For determination of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to tislelizumab, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) 
immunoassay method using the Meso Scale Discovery (technology) was developed and validated 
(8354-373). A standard 3-tiered approach was applied, comprising a screening assay followed by 
confirmation of ADA status and determination of ADA titer. Assay sensitivity was determined to be 
21.7 ng/mL relative to surrogate ADA and drug tolerance was 200 μg/mL in the presence of 100 ng/mL 
of surrogate ADA.  Two different antibodies (mAb and pAb) were used as positive controls during the 
ADA assay validation in order to provide a complete characterization of assay parameters. The mAb PC 
(“reference antibody 1”) was used for the whole method validation (to prepare positive control samples 
used in the whole method validation process and validation samples, except for the drug tolerance 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 74/165 
 
  
 
 
 
samples), while the pAb PC (“reference antibody 2”) was used only in the drug tolerance evaluations 
(to prepare drug tolerance samples). This is considered to be acceptable. 
A competitive ECL ligand-binding assay utilizing MSD technology to detect neutralizing antibodies 
(NAbs) to tislelizumab was also developed and validated (8369-215). The NAb assay sensitivity was 
173 ng/mL. Drug tolerance was 100 μg/mL and 10 µg/mL in the presence of 1000 ng/mL and 500 
ng/mL of surrogate NAb in the serum which is considered too low for adequate detection of Nab in a 
relevant number of study samples with tislelizumab concentrations >10µg/mL. Thus, confirmed ADAs 
against tislelizumab might be not correctly classified as neutralizing. No Hook effect and no 
interference with PD-1 concentrations up to 4000 pg/mL was observed. Selectivity of the assay was 
not demonstrated in disease state matrix. However, to test the selectivity, additional experiments were 
performed in pre-dose samples from clinical studies 302 and 303. Therefore, 10 samples for each 
patient population were analyzed in the NAb assay unspiked as well as spiked with LPC and HPC 
concentration of the positive control. The results of the additional experiments currently provided were 
in accordance with the acceptance criteria of the EU guidance and are considered acceptable.  
Population PK model 
The final population PK model was a 3-compartment model with first order elimination. The dataset 
consisted of 14,473 observed serum concentrations from 2,596 subjects enrolled in 12 clinical studies 
of tislelizumab. In the PopPK model dataset, there are 52 BLQ samples, approximately 0.36% of the 
total 14525 samples, which were excluded from the analysis. Due to the small percentage of BLQ data, 
exclusion of these data is not considered to affect the overall conclusions of the PopPK analysis and is 
thus considered to be acceptable. In addition, 11 PK samples, which were outside the proven stability 
timeframe, were included in the population PK dataset. However, these 11 PK samples are not 
considered to have a significant impact on the population PK modelling and parameter estimation 
because the number of samples (11) is very small compared to the entire dataset and only accounted 
for 0.076% of the total number of population PK data points. In addition, these data points do not 
have extreme values nor are they outside the range of samples that were within the proven stability 
timeframe.  
In the final PopPK model, WT, age, sex, ALB, TUMSZ, TUMTP, and ADA were identified as statistically 
significant covariates on the PK of tislelizumab, while covariate sensitivity analysis showed that body 
weight was the most influential covariate on tislelizumab exposure. This is in line with what has been 
described for other monoclonal antibodies in the past. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) and prediction-corrected 
visual predictive check (VPC) plots showed good agreement between the observed and the simulated 
exposure supporting the structural model. However, more details on the included population regarding 
to BW were required to ensure that the data are representative of the EU population. Although, with 
the proposed 200 mg Q3W dosing regimen, the observed exposure and the simulated overall exposure 
(AUC) at steady state were lower in patients with BW ≥89 kg than in patients with BW < 89 kg, this 
difference is not considered clinically meaningful, based on the data provided.  
Referring to the above presented pcVPC plots by treatment regimen, model-fit for the Q2W treatment 
regimen is slightly worse, as a tendency towards slight underprediction of observed values is shown. 
EC PK (observed exposure profiles) seem similar to NSCLC which constitutes the majority of data 
(44.3%), thus the combined diagnostics are adequate to describe the fit of EC subjects as well. For 
further confirmation, VPCs stratified per cancer type and for Study 302 were presented upon request. 
The model fit was less good than for the VPCs reported for “All subjects” mainly driven by data from 
NSCLC patients, and underpredicted concentrations <21 days after dosing whereas overpredicting was 
observed at later time points. In addition, diagnostic goodness-of-fit plots stratified for Study 302 and 
for EC were provided upon request. Based on the data provided, the current model appears to have 
acceptable descriptive and predictive performance.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 75/165 
 
  
 
 
No exposure differences (simulated) were observed based on tumour subtype. 
Incidence of ADAs and NAbs were low and seem to have a lowering effect on exposure. Even the mean 
exposure was lower than the mean for ADA negatives, all ADA/Nab positive data were within the range 
of data points of ADA negatives, thus the effect is not considered clinically relevant. The submitted Pop 
PK model can adequately describe the PK of tislelizumab in patients with EC and other cancer 
types/subtypes included in the analysis.  
ADME 
Tislelizumab is presently intended to be solely administered via the IV route, which implies that the 
drug will be 100% bioavailable. Cmax ranged between 89.5 µg/mL and 126 µg/mL. Central volume of 
distribution and clearance of tislelizumab estimated by population PK analysis was 3.05 L and be 0.153 
L/day, respectively. These values correspond to typical values described for V and CL of monoclonal 
antibodies in the past. 
No time-varying CL has been observed for tislelizumab, which was concluded from the investigation of 
an empirical model of time-varying clearance that did not improve model fit of the initial base model. 
This is considered somewhat unexpected, given that other checkpoint inhibitors currently approved 
which target PD-1/PD-L1 have all been described to exhibit time-varying CL (decrease in CL when 
tumour burden declines and disease state improves, presumably due to TMDD). In line with this, 
tumour size was determined to be a significant covariate affecting tislelizumab CL (lower tumour size 
resulted in decreased CL and higher AUC, large tumour size resulted in increased CL and decreased 
AUC). Although most published popPK models for other checkpoint inhibitors exhibited time varying 
CL, based on the currently updated information provided, it appears that the time-varying clearance of 
tislelizumab has no strong meaningful impact on the PK characteristics of tislelizumab. Both assessed 
popPK models with or without time-varying clearance appear to be largely comparable in the PK 
metrics (e.g. geometric mean of AUC, Cmax and Cmin after dose 1 or at steady state (ss)). Therefore, 
the current approach and conclusion of a 3-compartment model without time-varying CL appears to be 
valid and appropriate based on the currently provided data.  
The estimate for the terminal half-life of tislelizumab derived from population PK analysis (which is also 
stated in the SmPC) differs from the result obtained for t1/2 in noncompartmental analyses (i.e. study 
001 and study 102). However, it was clarified, that the terminal half-life (t1/2) of tislelizumab from the 
PopPK model was derived from the PK concentration time profiles for the original 2596 patients (from 
12 studies), that were simulated following 200 mg Q3W IV for 17 doses. The steady state t1/2 was 
then estimated by non-compartmental analyses (NCA) based on the simulated concentration time 
profile from day 336 to day 347. However, the observed post-treatment PK concentration samples for 
NCA were limited (n = 5 for study 001 and n=10 for study 102 at the flat dose level of 200 mg Q3W) 
and the variability in study 001 for the apparent terminal half-life at a flat dose 200 mg Q3W was quite 
high (127%). In addition, the applicant clarified that the Q2W and Q3W dosing intervals in study 001 
and Q3W intervals in Study 102 limited the sampling time windows for PK profiles after the first dose, 
therefore were not sufficient to robustly characterize the t1/2 of tislelizumab using NCA. The approach 
of using the estimated terminal half-life of tislelizumab derived from the population PK analysis based 
on sparse samples from a large patient population pooled from all studies with evaluable PK data, is 
considered acceptable. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
PK of tislelizumab was shown to be linear and dose-proportional at dosing regimens of 0.5 mg/kg to 10 
mg/kg once every 2 or 3 weeks and 200 mg Q3W. Steady-state accumulation ratio of tislelizumab PK 
exposure is approximately 2-fold. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 76/165 
 
  
 
 
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Data from patients 
with severe renal impairment are too limited to make dosing recommendations for this population. 
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Data from 
patients with severe hepatic impairment are too limited to make dosing recommendations for this 
population. 
Variability 
Inter-individual variability with regard to PK parameters of tislelizumab was moderate, e.g. the popPK-
derived estimate of inter-individual variability for tislelizumab CL was 26.3%. Higher inter-individual 
variability (74.7%, and 99.9%) was observed for V2 and V3. 
The variability values were obtained by taking the largest differences between the 5th and 95th 
percentile exposures in the overall population compared to the typical individual, which are ~ 55.8%, 
47.3%, and 70.8% for AUC,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss, respectively. 
Exposure in patient population 
In study 001, PK of tislelizumab at dose levels ranging from 0.5 mg/kg – 10 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W was 
assessed by noncompartmental analysis. PK was determined after the first dose and in Cycle 4 (for 
Q2W regimen) or Cycle 5 (for Q3W regimen), corresponding to steady state. However, PK at steady 
state (Cycle 4 or Cycle 5) was derived from a rather limited number of patients (at 200 mg flat dose 
Q3W, 5 patients have contributed to PK results), therefore, reliability of those data is considered 
questionable. Geometric means of AUC0-21d, Cycle 1, and AUC0-inf, Cycle 1, were 644 and 1075 
μg•day/mL, respectively. At steady state (Cycle 4 or Cycle 5), geometric mean AUC0-tau was 825 
μg•day/mL. 
In the Phase 1 part of study 101, further noncompartmental PK analyses were performed for 
tislelizumab dosed at 200 mg Q3W. The number of patients after the first dose (Cycle 1) and after 
multiple dosing at Cycle 5 was 20 patients and 12 patients, respectively. Overall, PK results were 
similar to those obtained in study 001. The geometric means of AUC0-tau in Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 were 
582 and 1073 μg•day/mL, respectively. 
After doses of tislelizumab at 200 mg once every 3 weeks, the geometric mean of AUCss was 
estimated by population PK analysis to be 1283 μg•day/mL. The estimate is similar to results for 
AUCtau at Cycle 4 or Cycle 5 derived by noncompartmental PK analyses in studies 001 and 102. 
No meaningful discrepancies resulted from re-analysis of the population PK model as described in 
popPK report amendment 1. 
Special populations 
The effects of various covariates on tislelizumab PK were assessed in population PK analyses. The 
following factors had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of tislelizumab: age (range 18 to 
90 years), weight (range 32 to 130 kg), gender, race (White, Asian and other), mild to moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCr] ≥30 ml/min), mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin ≤3 times ULN and any AST), and tumour burden. 
Mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of tislelizumab and no dose 
adjustment is needed for these patients. Based on the limited number of patients with severe renal 
impairment (n = 5), the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab is 
not conclusive. As for other mAbs, there is no mechanistic rationale for an increase in exposure with 
reduced renal function. Based on currently available information it is not suggested that the observed 
increase in tislelizumab exposure in patients with severe renal impairment (50.5% higher as compared 
to subjects with normal renal function) resulted in any clinically relevant impact on efficacy or safety 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 77/165 
 
  
 
 
parameter however no dosing recommendations can be made for these patients (see sections 4.2 and 
5.2 of the SmPC).  
Tislelizumab has no study conducted in pediatric subjects. 
In the population PK analyses of tislelizumab, no clinically relevant differences in the clearance of 
tislelizumab were found between patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST >ULN 
or bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST, n = 396) or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1.5 
to 3 x ULN and any AST; n = 12), compared to patients with normal hepatic function (bilirubin ≤ ULN 
and AST = ULN, n = 2 182) No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). Based on the limited number of patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin >3 x ULN and any AST, n = 2), the effect of severe hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab is unknown and no dosing recommendations for 
this population can be made. 
The weight is similar in the different hepatic function groups and therefore not a potential confounder 
of the influence of hepatic impairment on tislelizumab PK. The use of AST, ALT, or total bilirubin as 
markers of metabolic liver function is questioned but will not be further pursued since tislelizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody for which the elimination is not expected to depend on the hepatic function.   
Interactions 
The impact of combination therapy on the covariate-adjusted tislelizumab PK parameters (CL and Vc) 
were evaluated in post hoc analysis based on the final popPK model. Again, accounting for the overall 
variability of exposures, differences were not considered clinically significant, which is agreed. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacodynamic parameters were investigated in the clinical development program for 
tislelizumab. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was analysed in 10 clinical studies of tislelizumab administered either as monotherapy 
or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with different tumour types. Anti-drug antibodies 
were determined by screening and confirmatory assays, followed by the analysis of ADA titer. 
Of 1 916 antidrug antibodies (ADA)-evaluable patients treated at the recommended dose of 200 mg 
once every 3 weeks, 18.3% of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA, and neutralising 
antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 0.9% of patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that 
ADA status was a statistically significant covariate on clearance; however, the presence of treatment-
emergent ADA against tislelizumab appears to have no clinically relevant impact on pharmacokinetics 
or efficacy. 
Among ADA-evaluable patients, the following rates of adverse events (AEs) have been observed for the 
ADA-positive population compared to the ADA-negative population, respectively: grade ≥3 AEs 50.9% 
vs. 39.3%, serious adverse events (SAEs) 37.1% vs. 29.7%, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
10.8% vs 10.2%. Patients who developed treatment-emergent ADAs tended to have overall poorer 
health and disease characteristics at baseline which can confound the interpretation of the safety 
analysis. Available data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on possible patterns of adverse drug 
reactions. 
Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses were performed specifically for the ESCC study 302 to understand 
the relationships between PK and efficacy, as well as safety parameters.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 78/165 
 
  
 
 
Exposure-efficacy analyses 
The exposure-efficacy relationship of OS in the ITT population was explored by Kaplan-Meier curves 
stratified by exposure (Cavg,dose1) quartiles. A longer OS was observed in the highest tislelizumab 
exposure quartile compared to those patients in the lower three quartiles. The median survival in the 
tislelizumab arm for patients with the highest quartile of exposure was 14.65 months. 
In order to investigate the potential confounding effects of baseline patient characteristics and tumour 
growth rate (TGR) on the observed E-R relationship of OS, a Cox proportional hazards model for OS 
was developed based on tislelizumab treated patients in study BGB-A317-302. Albumin, tumour 
growth rate, and tislelizumab Cavg,dose1were found to be significant covariates in this analysis. Since 
patients’ baseline prognostic factors are known to confound E-R relationships for monoclonal antibodies 
and statistically significant E-R relationship was observed in this analysis, a Cox proportional hazards 
model was developed with tislelizumab exposure quartile instead of continuous exposure as a 
sensitivity analysis. The results show that besides ALB and TGR, only the highest exposure quartile 
(Q4) was a significant predictor relative to the lowest exposure quartile (Q1) in the final model. 
Another set of sensitivity analysis was performed using the OS data from both arms of the study and 
tislelizumab exposure as a categorical variable (quartiles). Along with tumour size, albumin and TGR, 
only the highest exposure quartile was significant. However, due to lack of consistency in drug effect at 
different exposures quartiles the applicant considers the E-R relationship likely confounded by the 
imbalance in baseline factors. Overall, patients in the highest Cavg,dose1 quartile (Q4) exhibited more 
favorable prognostic factors (median tumour size 30 mm in Q4 vs 58 mm in Q1; 28.1% female in Q4 
vs 10.9% in Q1; 29.7% patients with ECOG = 0 in Q4 vs 25% in Q1; 0% patients with ALB<35 g/L in 
Q4 vs 17% in Q1) compared with patients in the lowest Cavg,dose1 quartile (Q1). Taken together, 
these results suggest that tislelizumab exposure is not an independent predictor variable of OS. This 
assumption is further supported by sensitivity analyses excluding patients with missing tumour growth 
rate values, extremely low albumin, high eGFR or small baseline tumour size showing tislelizumab 
exposure is not significant Comparable results were obtained for the overall ESCC population including 
studies 001, 102 and 302.: There appears to be a positive trend between exposure and efficacy, this 
trend is not statistically significant after adjusting for CL and other baseline characteristics.  
The phenomenon of E-R confounding has been broadly observed for monoclonal antibody cancer 
therapies (including immune checkpoint inhibitors) and is believed to relate to cancer cachexia and/or 
inflammation causing more rapid protein turnover and thus mAb catabolism in patients with poor 
prognosis. In the current analysis, the observed tislelizumab E-R relationship for OS was likely a result 
of increased tislelizumab clearance in patients with poorer prognosis rather than a true exposure effect 
on the drug efficacy.  
The exposure-response relationship of the ORR was explored by exposure boxplots and the probability 
of response plots. The mean exposure values were similar between responders and non-responders. 
The mean Cavg, dose1 values were 30.3 µg/mL in responders compared with 29.0 µg/mL in non-
responders. The probability of response plots showed that a slight trend between tislelizumab exposure 
and the ORR. However, logistic regression models for the ORR indicated that neither tislelizumab Cavg, 
dose1 nor race has a significant effect on E-R relationship for the ORR. 
Exposure-safety analyses 
The relationship between tislelizumab exposure and clinical safety endpoints was explored based on 
data from study BGB-A317-302. This analysis results showed that there was no evidence of higher 
tislelizumab exposure leading to increased rates of any AE ≥ grade 3, immune-mediated AE, AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation, infusion-related reaction, AEs of special interest, and AEs leading 
to dose modification. In Amendment 2 of the ER Report, the relationship between tislelizumab 
exposure and serious AEs was also investigated. No increased incidence of SAEs with increasing 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 79/165 
 
  
 
 
exposure was observed. Also, no significant differences or consistent trends were observed between 
Asians and Whites for the safety events tested. Hence, it is concluded that no clinically relevant 
exposure-safety relationship was observed based on the selected safety endpoints from the study 
BGB-A317-302. This is agreed. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, i.e. immunogenicity and exposure-response 
relationships, of tislelizumab have been adequately characterized.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical studies providing efficacy data in support of the application of tislelizumab for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ESCC after prior 
systemic therapy are presented in Table 3-3-1. Study 302, a pivotal, open-label, multicenter, 
randomized Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab vs. ICC in patients with 
unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ESCC is the principal basis for the submission. 
Supportive data derive from the early, uncontrolled single-arm studies 001 and 102. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose-response study 
Study 001 was 2-stage open-label study consisting of a Phase 1A dose escalation and dose-finding 
component to establish the MTD or RP2D(s) followed by a Phase 1B component to investigate efficacy 
and safety of the RP2D in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours.  
Dose levels investigated were 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg Q2W and 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 200 mg 
flat Q3W.  
The recommended dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W was selected based on the claimed similarity of 
preliminary efficacy and safety results at the 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg dose levels, dose-proportional PK 
characteristics of tislelizumab across a range of 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg with no correlation between 
clearance and body weight, and the 200 mg Q3W flat dosing regimen Q3W showing tislelizumab 
concentrations within the range of concentrations observed from the 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg doses. 
Further support for the selected dosing regimen derives from the exposure-response analysis which 
comprised data from the early clinical studies 001, 102, 203, and 204. No significant or clinically 
meaningful ER relationships were observed between exposure and efficacy (ORR) or safety endpoints 
based on the data including dose ranges up to 10 mg/kg.

However, a trend towards increased efficacy (ORR) with increasing tislelizumab concentrations was 
seen in the ESCC population.

This trend was consistently observed in the exposure-efficacy analysis (both for OS and ORR) 
conducted for Study 302 separately (see section 3.3.1). In both analyses, p-value was only slightly 
above 0.05. Upon request, the applicant provided exposure-response analyses for the overall ESCC 
population by developing a model that includes data from Studies 001, 102 and Study 302.

Also, with these analyses a positive relationship between exposure and efficacy response was 
determined. To adjust for baseline characteristics and the potential confounding effect of CL, stepwise 
covariate search based on AIC was conducted on baseline characteristics and the base model. As a 
result, in addition to CL and Cavg,dose1 several other baseline covariates were retained in the final 
model. While the association between Cavg,dose1 and efficacy outcomes is statistically significant in 
the base model, after adjusting for CL and other baseline covariates, the association between 
Cavg,dose1 and efficacy outcome is no longer statistically significant in the final model. 
For discussion of exposure-response analyses for efficacy, see section 2.6.3.  
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
Pivotal Study 302 
Study 302 is an open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety 
of tislelizumab versus ICC (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan) in patients with unresectable recurrent 
locally advanced or metastatic ESCC after prior systemic therapy. The study design schematic is 
presented in Figure 3-3-4.

The overall study design is endorsed. Given the choice of treatments in the comparator arm, the open-
label study design is considered acceptable. The selected stratification factors (region, ECOG PS, ICC 
option) are considered adequate; however, it is noted that the Applicant has chosen to stratify by three 
regions in Asia (Asia excluding Japan vs Japan vs US/EU).The Applicant should clarified that the 
inclusion of Japan as a separate factor was to ensure that baseline characteristics in Japanese patients 
were balanced between treatment arms to support future regulatory activities in Japan.  
Study treatment continued until occurrence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity or other 
discontinuation criteria were met. In certain circumstances (patient is stable and deriving clinical 
benefit), the investigator was allowed to decide that patients randomized to receive tislelizumab could 
be treated beyond initial progression.

Overall, the key eligibility criteria for participation in Study 302 are deemed acceptable. The study 
population was deemed adequate by CHMP (Scientific Advice Procedure No.: 
EMEA/H/SA/3646/2/2017/II). However, it is noted that the population is somewhat selected 
accounting for the fact that approx. 50% of ESCC patients have ECOG PS 2-4 at the time of initiation 
of 2nd line treatment (Jaffe et al. Thorac Cancer, 2022). 
The provision of tumour tissue was not mandatory for enrolment in this study; PD-L1 status was 
missing for approx. 30% of patients (please see section 3.3.4.5). 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 86/165 
 
  
 
 
Treatments 
Tislelizumab 
Tislelizumab was administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle at a dose of 200 mg by intravenous 
infusion (see Table 3-3-2). The initial infusion (Cycle 1, Day 1) was delivered over 60 minutes. If this 
was well-tolerated, subsequent infusions were administered over 30 minutes. 
Investigator-Chosen Chemotherapy 
The choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan) and treatment regimen was based on 
local and/or country-specific guidelines and investigators’ discretion, taking into account prior therapy 
and the performance status of the patient. The first dose of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan was 
dependent upon the patient’s baseline body surface area. Subsequent doses were recalculated if the 
change of body surface area (increase or decrease) from baseline was ≥ 10%. 
Table 3 - 3 - 1 Dosing regimen of tislelizumab and investigator-chosen chemotherapy 
The selected ICC options were standard of care at the time of initiation of Study 302 and are 
considered acceptable as active comparator. Treatment schedules and doses are in line with 
recommendations in current treatment guidelines (2022 NCCN Guidelines, Lordick et al. 2016). 
Dose Delay or Modification  
Tislelizumab 
No dose reductions of tislelizumab were allowed in this study. Dose delay or interruption of < 12 weeks 
was permitted. If the delay of tislelizumab was > 12 weeks, treatment was stopped permanently. 
Toxicity management guidelines were in place that requested withholding or permanent 
discontinuation in case of immune-related adverse events or infusion-related reactions. Respective 
guidance has been implemented in the SmPC. 
ICC 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 87/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Guidance on dose delay, interruption or modification for paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan was 
provided in the protocol. 
Chemotherapy treatment might be delayed up to 21 days if the reason for the delay was 
toxicity/adverse event. If any chemotherapy agent was held for > 6 weeks from the anticipated 
treatment date, or the dose level -2 was not tolerated, chemotherapy was permanently discontinued. 
Concomitant medication 
Most concomitant medications and therapies were allowed if deemed necessary in keeping with the 
local standards of medical care at the discretion of the investigator for the supportive care (e.g., 
antiemetics, antidiarrheals, pain medications, and nutritional support) and in a patient’s well-being. 
The following medications were prohibited or restricted at the time of screening and during the 
administration of tislelizumab: 
• 
Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug-related adverse event) 
•  Systemic corticosteroids > 10 mg daily (prednisone or equivalent), except to treat or control a 
drug-related adverse event or for short-term use as prophylactic treatment 
• 
Live vaccines ≤ 28 days before the first dose of tislelizumab and 60 days after the last dose of 
tislelizumab 
•  Herbal remedies with immune-stimulating properties (eg, mistletoe extract) or that were 
known to potentially interfere with liver or other major organ functions (eg, hypericin). 
During all study treatment, concurrent antineoplastic therapy and extensive radiation therapy were 
prohibited or restricted at the time of screening and during the administration of study treatment.  
Permitted and prohibited concomitant medication at screening and during study treatment is 
considered adequate. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To compare the overall survival (OS) in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set after treatment with 
tislelizumab versus ICC when given as second-line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable or 
metastatic ESCC. 
Key Secondary Objective: 
• 
To compare OS in the PD-L1-Positive Analysis Set (PD-L1 expression status of visually-
estimated Combined Positive Score [vCPS] ≥ 10%, based on Ventana  PD-L1 (SP263) assay) 
after treatment with tislelizumab versus ICC when given as second-line treatment in patients 
with advanced unresectable or metastatic ESCC 
Other Secondary Objectives: 
•  To compare the following endpoints as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) between tislelizumab and chemotherapy 
treatments: objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of 
response (DOR) 
•  To compare Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) between tislelizumab and chemotherapy 
treatments, assessed by 3 patient-reported outcome questionnaires, including the European

Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 
(EORTC QLQ-C30), the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Oesophageal Cancer Module 
(EORTC QLQ-OES18), and the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-5L) 
•  To compare the safety and tolerability between tislelizumab and chemotherapy treatments 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was overall survival in the ITT Analysis Set, defined as the 
time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. In the absence of death on 
or before the data cutoff date, overall survival was censored either at the date that the patient was last 
known to be alive or the date of data cutoff, whichever occurred earlier. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Overall survival in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% 
•  Objective response rate, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, in the ITT Analysis 
Set and patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% 
•  Duration of response for responders (patients who achieved a CR or PR), as assessed by the 
investigator per RECIST v1.1, defined as progression/death event-free time counted from the 
date that the response criteria were first met to the date of first documented radiological 
progressive disease or death (whichever occurred first) 
• 
PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of 
disease progression assessed by the Investigators per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, 
whichever occurred first 
•  Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): Questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-OES18, 
and EQ-5D-5L 
Sample size 
The study was planned to enrol 500 patients in order to observe 400 deaths. This was expected to 
provide 82% power to detect an overall survival HR of 0.75 at the 1-sided significance level of 
α=0.025, corresponding to an improvement in median overall survival from 6 months to 8 months, in 
the ITT Analysis Set. Assumptions were based on recently published results of anti-PD-1 therapies in 
second-line treatment of ESCC (Kojima et al 2020; Kato et al 2019; Huang et al 2020).  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
In total, 512 patients were randomized 1:1 to tislelizumab treatment or ICC treatment. Stratification 
was conducted by region (Asia [excluding Japan] versus Japan versus US/EU), ECOG performance 
status (0 versus 1), and ICC option (paclitaxel versus docetaxel versus irinotecan). The choice of ICC 
was determined by the investigator before randomization. ICC option was included as further 
stratification factor to minimize any potential impact of local clinical practice on study outcome and 
data interpretation.

Statistical methods 
No estimand was defined for this study. It is rather clear that the primary analysis of OS targets a 
treatment policy estimand (see below), however for secondary analyses the estimand is less clear.  
The primary analysis population was planned to be the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set including 
all randomized patients. 
The PD-L1 positive analysis set was planned to include patients whose tumour and immune cell score 
(TIC score) met the pre-defined cut-off (specified in the statistical analysis plan) using VENTANA PD
L1 
(SP263) CDx Assay. TIC score is the total percentage of the tumour area covered by tumour cells with 
PD-L1 membrane staining and tumour
‑
associated immune cells with PD-L1 staining at any intensity. 
The primary endpoint of OS was planned to be compared between tislelizumab and ICC arms in the ITT 
‑
analysis set by means of a stratified log-rank test, stratified by selected stratification factors of ECOG 
performance status (0 vs 1) and ICC option (paclitaxel vs docetaxel vs irinotecan), using a significance 
level of one-sided 0.025.  
In the absence of death, patients were planned to be censored either at the date that the patient was 
last known to be alive or the date of data cut-off, whichever comes earlier. 
The primary analysis was stratified only by selected stratification factors of those used in randomized 
treatment allocation. This is not fully in line with current regulatory guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/295050/2013, EMA/CHMP/ICH/453276/2016 Rev.1). However, the applicant provided an 
analysis stratified for all strata of randomization and this analysis provided consistent results.  
It was planned that, if the null hypothesis for OS in the ITT analysis set is rejected, the key secondary 
endpoint, OS in the PD-L1 positive analysis set, would be tested sequentially. The familywise type I 
error was planned to be strongly controlled at the one-sided level 0.025. Only OS in the ITT and in the 
PD-L1 positive analysis sets were planned with multiplicity control, all further analyses are descriptive. 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for selected stratification factors (ECOG and ICC option) 
in the ITT analysis set and the PD-L1 positive analysis set was planned to be provided for ORR per 
RECIST v1.1. The two-sided 95% CIs for the odds ratio in ORR was planned to be calculated, as well as 
Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs of ORR for each treatment arm. 
A log-rank test stratified by selected stratification factors (ECOG and ICC option) was planned to be 
used to analyse the PFS differences between two treatment arms. The stratified Cox regression was 
planned to be used to estimate the hazard ratio of PFS. A 95% confidence interval (CI) of HR in PFS 
was planned to be constructed. Data for patients without disease progression or death at the time of 
analysis was planned to be censored at the time of the last tumour assessment. Data for patients who 
are lost to follow-up prior to documented disease progression was planned to be censored at the last 
tumour assessment date when the patient is known to be progression-free. Data for patients who start 
to receive new anti-cancer therapy was planned to be censored at the last tumour assessment date 
prior to the introduction of new therapy. The applicant provided sensitivity analyses with different 
censoring rules. 
In order to avoid excessive reliance on unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves, the applicant was asked to 
provide restricted mean survival time (RMST) over the study period, adjusting for the stratification 
factors and PD-L1. Given the baseline imbalance noted for Europe and North America this may provide 
a useful supplement to the KM analyses and inform the benefit-risk assessment. 
Initially an interim analysis was planned, but it was removed in amendment 4. A simple design without 
the interim analysis is supported. The applicant clarified the reasons that led to removal of the interim 
analysis in the responses to the LoQ as requested, please see study conduct below.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 684 patients from 132 sites in 11 countries/regions (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
Korea, Mainland China, Spain, Taiwan, UK, and the US) signed informed consent forms. Patient 
disposition of all enrolled study participants is presented in Figure 3-3-5.

More patients in the ICC as compared to the tislelizumab arm were randomized but not treated or withdrew from the study, 
which is presumably a consequence of the open-label design of the study. The higher proportion of patients in the control 
group who were not treated at all or discontinued treatment early due to withdrawal of consent could have had an impact 
on the performance of the control arm. Sensitivity analyses provided reassurance that this did not substantially impact 
study results (see below).   
By the data cutoff date (01 Dec 2020), more than 90% of patients had discontinued study treatment, 
mostly due to radiographic progression. Approximately 80% of patients discontinued the study due to 
death (77% vs. 83.2% in the tislelizumab vs. ICC arm). At the data cutoff date, 20% of patients in the 
tislelizumab arm and 10% of patients in the ICC arm remained on study. 
Recruitment 
The first patient enrolled in Study BGB-A317-302 was randomized on 26 January 2018. In Asia, the 
randomization of the last patient occurred on 11 September 2019; in Europe/North America, the 
randomization of the last patient occurred on 04 March 2020. Data cutoff is 1 December 2020.  
The median study follow-up time was 8.49 months (range: 0.2 to 31.7 months) for the tislelizumab 
arm and 5.80 months (range: 0.0 to 30.8 months) for the ICC arm.

Protocol deviations 
In the ITT analysis set, 11.7% of patients had important protocol deviations, of whom approximately 
2% of patients had critical (=important protocol deviations with significant impact on efficacy and/or 
safety analyses) protocol deviations.

Protocol amendments 
The original global protocol for this study was dated 13 July 2017. Key changes to the protocol are 
summarized below. 
Amendment Version 1.0 (Global, Dated 07 November 2017) 
• 
• 
Evaluation of objective response rate, PFS, and duration of response using immune-related 
RECIST was removed because the tool had not been validated. 
The stratification factors were modified (gender was replaced with ECOG PS score and ICC 
option) per the request from the US FDA. 
•  Alternative paclitaxel and docetaxel treatment regimens were added to provide Japan-specific 
regimens per the request from the PMDA. 
•  Clarified that patients who had received ≥ 2 prior systemic treatments for advanced 
unresectable or metastatic ESCC were excluded. 
•  Management guidance for infusion-related reactions, severe hypersensitivity reactions, flu-like 
symptoms, and renal function abnormalities were added. 
• 
The guidance for the immune-mediated adverse event management was modified and 
updated. 
Amendment Version 2.0 (Global, Dated 06 December 2017) 
• 
The requirement of treatment beyond radiographic progression was further clarified per the 
request from the US FDA. 
•  Criteria for dose modification of paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan and permanent 
discontinuation of chemotherapy regimens were clarified, and dose modifications guidelines for 
specific adverse events and other toxicities were provided, per request from the US FDA. 
Amendment Version 3.0 (Global, Dated 08 November 2018) 
• CK (creatine kinase) and CK-MB (creatine kinase cardiac muscle isoenzyme) tests and 
management guidance were added to monitor the risk of myocarditis more closely. 
• Incorporated the US FDA request of implementing measures to further decrease the potential for 
viral reactivation: Continuous treatment for 6 months after treatment discontinuation was 
required for patients with detectable HBsAg or HBV DNA; continuous effective antiviral therapy 
was required for patients who had detectable HCV and were receiving treatment at screening. 
• The criterion to exclude patients who had a history of anterior organ transplant, including stem-
cell allograft, was added per the request from the French National Agency for the Safety of 
Medicines and Health Products (ANSM). 
• Immune-mediated adverse event management guidelines were updated: “Tislelizumab must be 
permanently discontinued for any onset of Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 immune-mediated 
adverse events.” 
• A new appendix of “Determining Line of Therapy in ESCC” was added to further clarify the 
definition of first-line systemic treatment in inclusion criteria, and first-line or front-line systemic 
treatment was defined as “platinum-based regimen.” 
Amendment Version 4.0 (Global, Dated 20 March 2020) 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 93/165 
 
  
 
 
• Updated the statistical estimation of the sample size to increase the sample size from 450 to 500 
and increase target number of death events from 336 to 400, with the following consideration: 
(1) overall survival HR was adjusted from 0.73 to 0.75 based on recently published results of 
anti-PD-1 therapies in second-line treatment of ESCC and (2) addition of a dropout rate of 5%. 
• The predefined interim analysis was removed due to the lack of geographically representative 
population for the analysis, which resulted from the disparity in global enrollment rates. 
• The overall survival in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% was added as the key secondary endpoint 
of this study to reflect the clinical relevance and importance of the PD-L1 biomarker in ESCC 
observed in competitors’ published data. (Note: PD-L1 assessment [by Ventana PD-L1 SP263 CDx 
Assay] was not started before the key secondary endpoint was added in this protocol 
amendment, and PD-L1 status of each patient was unknown.)

Source: Excerpt from Tables 14.1.2.1a and 14.1.5.1a CSR Study 302; updated after PD-L1 status reclassification 
Patients in the Asia subgroup were younger as compared to those in the Europe/North America 
subgroup (median age of 61.0 years versus 65.0 years, respectively), had a higher percentage of 
males (88.9% versus 67.6%), and had a higher percentage of ECOG PS scores of 1 (79.0% versus 
62.0%). While percentages of patients with a PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% were similar in the Asia subgroup 
(27.5%) and Europe/North America subgroup (28.7%), the percentages of patients with PD-L1 vCPS < 
10% were higher in the Europe/North America subgroup (55.6%) than in the Asia subgroup (40.1%). 
This difference may be explained by the equally higher percentage of patients with missing PD-L1 
status in the Asian population (32.4% vs. 15.7% in Europe/North America). Nevertheless, it cannot be 
excluded that a higher rate of patients with PD-L1 vCPS < 10% was enrolled in Europe/North America 
as compared to Asia in Study 302. Fewer patients in the Europe/North America subgroup had neo-

/adjuvant therapy as first-line anticancer systemic therapy (Europe/North America: 2.8% vs. Asia: 
19.8%). This different proportion of neo-/adjuvant treatment obviously reflects regional differences in 
standard clinical practise. Generally, the imbalances observed between the Asia and Europe/North 
America subgroups yield uncertainties as regards to the external validity of the study.  
In addition, imbalances observed in PD-L1 expression and ECOG performance status specifically 
between treatment arms of the Europe/North America subgroup (PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10%: tislelizumab = 
40.0% vs. ICC = 17.0% and ECOG PS 1: tislelizumab = 58.2% vs. ICC = 66.0%) yield uncertainties 
with regard to the validity and credibility of study results in the EU population.

The applicant conducted a post-hoc analysis of confirmed objective response rates (ORR), which 
revealed slightly lower ORR as compared to the unconfirmed analysis but generally supported 
unconfirmed ORR results. The confirmed ORR was higher in the Tislelizumab Arm than in the ICC Arm 
(15.2% [95% CI: 11.1% to 20.2%] versus 6.6% [95% CI: 3.9% to 10.4%], respectively), with an 
objective response rate difference of 8.6% (95% CI: 3.3% to 13.9%) and an odds ratio of 2.57 (95% 
CI: 1.40 to 4.71) between the 2 arms.  
Health-Related Quality of Life 
Changes from baseline to Cycle 6 (mean change [standard deviation]) in HRQoL outcome scores 
showed a trend in favor of the Tislelizumab Arm versus the ICC Arm: 
•  A numerically smaller reduction in physical functioning was observed in the Tislelizumab Arm 
compared with the ICC Arm (Tislelizumab: -1.9 [10.33]; ICC: -5.7 [12.05]) (Figure 3-10, left) 
•  Global health status (GHS) improved from baseline in the Tislelizumab Arm but worsened in 
the ICC Arm (Tislelizumab: 1.9 [16.45]; ICC: -6.3 [14.82]) 
• 
There were slight numerical improvements in the overall symptoms, as measured by index 
score of QLQ-OES18, in the Tislelizumab Arm compared with a worsening in the ICC Arm 
(Tislelizumab: -0.6 [8.63]; ICC: 3.0 [12.05]) (Figure 3-10, right)

•  A numerically lower risk of clinically meaningful worsening was observed in the Tislelizumab 
Arm compared with the ICC Arm in physical functioning (stratified HR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.45 to 
1.00]) per EORTC QLQ-C30 and overall symptoms of reflux (stratified HR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.32 
to 0.80]), dysphagia (stratified HR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.53 to 1.07]), and pain (stratified HR: 0.89 
[95% CI: 0.59 to 1.35]) per EORTC QLQ-OES18 
•  Clinically meaningful differences in GHS between the Tislelizumab Arm compared with the ICC 
Arm were not observed (stratified HR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.65 to 1.41]) 
Accounting for the margin of the described differences in HRQoL outcomes, improvements in QoL are 
not considered clinically meaningful. In addition, the reliability of HRQoL results is hampered by the 
open-label design of Study 302. As such, patient-reported outcomes are not included in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were provided with alternative censoring rules in line with European guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1).

Data cutoff: 01DEC2020. Data extraction: 15JAN2021.  
Abbreviations: ICC = investigator chosen chemotherapy: paclitaxel vs docetaxel vs irinotecan; vCPS: visually-estimated combined 
positive score. Hazard ratio was based on unstratified Cox regression model including treatment as covariate. 
The race subcategory Other includes Black or African American, Not Reported, Unknown and Other. 
PD-L1 positive is defined as vCPS ≥ 10%, PD-L1 negative is defined as vCPS < 10%, Missing refers to the patients without sample 
collection or not evaluable at baseline. 
The applicant provided further subgroup analyses splitting patients by prior first-line systemic therapy 
(neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy, definitive chemoradiotherapy and other=palliative chemotherapy), 
which was considered of interest due to the higher proportion of patients treated with neo-adjuvant 
therapy in Asia (19.8%) than in Europe/North America (2.8%).

Further post-hoc efficacy analyses in subgroups by PD-L1 expression status and region were conducted 
(data not shown). Exploratory analyses do not indicate a meaningful impact of the imbalances 
observed between treatment groups in patients from the Europe/North America subgroup. Overall, 
efficacy subgroup analyses by region do not raise concerns regarding a differential treatment effect in 
the European population.

318 patients (62.1%), 166 patients (32.4%), and 28 patients (5.5%) were aged < 65 years, 65 to < 
75 years, and ≥ 75 years at baseline, respectively. No further survival analysis was performed for the ≥ 
75-year age group as the number of patients was small.  
Treatment with tislelizumab was associated with favourable improvements in OS compared with ICC 
across subgroups of age (< 65 years and ≥ 65 years), with unstratified HRs of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58 to 
0.97) and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.03) for patients from Asia and unstratified HRs of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.29 
to 1.15) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.96) for patients from Europe/North America, respectively. 
Besides, no significant differences in PFS and ORR were observed between the different age groups 
investigated. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric patients, as these have not been studied in the clinical trials.  
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Data for patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment are limited. Overall, 5 patients with severe 
renal impairment and 2 patients with severe hepatic impairment were included in the clinical trials. 
2.6.5.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Analytical validation 
Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) CDx assay and the algorithm of vCPS measure the total percentage of the 
tumour area covered by tumour cells with PD-L1 membrane staining and tumour
associated immune 
cells with PD-L1 staining at any intensity. 
‑
Shipping, storage, and handling of archival tumour, fresh tumour, and residual tumour tissue for the 
assessment of biomarkers were managed through a central laboratory. As confirmed with the 
responses, the involved sites are CAP/CLIA-certified, which is considered as a sufficient accreditation 
standard. 
Archival tumour tissues were required for central biomarker analysis, such as immunohistochemistry 
analysis of PD-L1 status, if available. In the absence of available archival tumour tissue samples, the 
collection of a fresh tumour biopsy at baseline was recommended, if accessible. Tumour tissues 
collection was not mandatory for eligibility evaluation for enrolment. 
As requested, he Applicant provided the analytical validation report for Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) CDx 
assay that showed that the assay is suitable (i.e. sufficiently analytically validated) to detect PD-L1 
expression in in ESCC tissue at the defined cut-off and applying the defined scoring algorithm (i.e. 
10% vCPS).  
Clinical Validation: 
Selection of PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% as the cutoff for the key secondary endpoint PD-L1 is expressed in 
tumour and tumour-infiltrating immune cells in ESCC at a prevalence of 18.4% to 82.8% (Guo et al 
2017), which may vary by different detecting antibodies, scoring methods, and cutoffs chosen. PD-L1 
expression level showed a trend of correlation with the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in 
multiple studies, including KEYNOTE-181, ATTRACTION-3, and ESCORT (Kojima et al 2020; Kato et al 
2019; Huang et al 2020). In these studies, PD-L1 prevalence for PD-L1 positive population ranged 
from 40% to 50%.  
In this study, overall survival in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% was selected as the key secondary 
endpoint to explore the predictive role of PD-L1 expression in ESCC. PD-L1 expression of the ESCC 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 112/165 
 
  
 
 
tumour was determined using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) CDx assay and the algorithm of vCPS, which 
measures the total percentage of the tumour area covered by tumour cells with PD-L1 membrane 
staining and tumour
associated immune cells with PD-L1 staining at any intensity. 
A 10% cutoff was selected based on post-hoc analysis of tumours from patients with ESCC who were 
‑
treated with tislelizumab (ESCC cohort from BGB-A317_Study_001 and BGB-A317-102 studies) based 
on pathological feasibility, assay reproducibility, assay performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value, and negative predictive value), and clinical outcomes in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 
10%, as well as PD-L1 positive prevalence. In these phase I/II studies, vCPS ≥ 10% has been 
analytically validated for ESCC before PD-L1 scoring in Study 302.  
Since the terminology (vCPS) may lead to confusion with the IP protected term “CPS” used by Merck, 
the Applicant is going to change the terminology from “vCPS” to “TAP (Tumour Area Positive) Score”. 
The Applicant confirmed that only the terminology is to be changed, there are no modifications 
regarding the scoring algorithm or the PD-L1 assay. 
Efficacy results by PD-L1 status: 
Please refer to “subgroups by PD-L1 expression”  
Testing of PD-L1 status – missing data 
In the original submission, PD-L1 status was missing for 99 patients (19.3%). As collection of tumour 
tissue for PD-L1 testing was not an enrolment eligibility criterion, tumour tissue samples were not 
submitted for 59 patients. Reasons for missing PD-L1 status among the remaining 40 patients included 
mostly testing failures (n=34) with insufficient or no tumour cells for 21 patients, unacceptable sample 
types (n=4) and withdrawal of informed consent (n=4).  
With the responses, the Applicant informed that further review of PD-L1 expression data after CSR 
finalization identified the use of unsuitable samples. Based on the sample eligibility criteria specified in 
the Ventana PD-L1 diagnostic protocol, 49 samples had to be considered invalid for the data analyses. 
Thus, the proportion of study patients with missing PD-L1 status increased from 19.3% (n=99) to 
28.9% (n=148) for the corrected analyses. Reasons for reclassification as “missing” included that cut 
slide dates were outside of stability window or unknown (n=27), unknown or inappropriate fixative 
(n=20) and fine needle aspiration (n=3). Both treatment arms were equally affected (numbers of 
reclassified samples n=24 and n=25, respectively).   
The Applicant provided updated results based on reclassified PD-L1 status. 
PD-L1 expression was not used as stratification factor, consequently imbalances regarding PD-L1 
expression status between the treatment groups in the ITT (vCPS ≥10% in 31.3% patients of the 
tislelizumab arm vs. 24.2% of patients in the ICC arm) could be seen. The Applicant provided further 
OS analysis to address this problem, however, in total those imbalances could have an impact on the 
credibility of the results.  
The Applicant was asked to further clarify the rationale for the vCPS ≥10% cut-off selection. A cutoff of 
CPS ≥10 with the Dako 22C3 antibody was used in KEYNOTE-181 and in KEYNOTE-590, in patients 
with esophageal cancer. In these studies no clinically meaningful benefit could be demonstrated in the 
CPS <10 population. The Applicant was asked to further justify his vCPS ≥10% cutoff and clinical 
validation data were submitted with the responses (derived from Studies 001 and 102). Validation data 
support the vCPS>=10% cutoff selection.

Not applicable. 
2.6.5.7.  Supportive studies  
Study 001 
This was a 2-stage open-label study consisting of a Phase 1A dose escalation and dose-finding 
component to establish the MTD or RP2D(s) followed by a Phase 1B component to investigate efficacy 
in selected tumour types and to further evaluate safety and tolerability of tislelizumab at RP2D(s). 
Study population: 
Eligible patients were male or female, ≥ 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed 
advanced or metastatic solid tumours for which no effective standard therapy was available, an ECOG 
PS score ≤ 1, adequate organ function, and ≥ 1 evaluable lesion per RECIST v1.1 without limit to the 
number of prior treatment lines. Patients who had received prior PD-1 or PD-L1 directed treatment, 
had active autoimmune disease, had a condition requiring systemic treatment with 
immunosuppressives, or had a history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis were 
excluded. 
Treatment:  
Patients with ESCC received tislelizumab 5 mg/kg IV Q3W until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
informed consent, or no evidence of continued clinical benefit. 
Endpoints:  
Efficacy was a secondary objective of Phase 1A and the primary objective of Phase 1B. Response to 
treatment was evaluated by each investigator. Efficacy measures included ORR, defined as the 
percentage of patients in the study whose best overall response was either CR or PR based on RECIST 
v1.1, PFS and DCR as assessed by RECIST v1.1, CBR, and DOR for responders. 
Study 102 
Study 102 was a Phase 1/2 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary antitumour 
activity of tislelizumab in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumours. Once the RP2D was 
determined in Phase 1, Phase 2 was conducted as an indication-specific expansion study for 11 arms of 
indications. 
Study population: 
Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or 
metastatic solid tumours whose disease had progressed or who were intolerant to last standard 
antitumour treatment or had no available standard treatment or had refused standard therapy. 
Patients had an ECOG PS score ≤ 1, adequate organ function, and ≥ 1 evaluable lesion per RECIST 
v1.1, with no limit to the number of prior treatment lines. Patients who had received prior PD-1 or PD-
L1 directed treatment, had active autoimmune disease, had a condition requiring systemic treatment 
with immunosuppressives, had a history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis, or 
had significant cardiovascular diseases were excluded. 
Treatment:  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 114/165 
 
  
 
 
All patients received 200 mg of tislelizumab IV once every 3 weeks. All patients continued to receive 
tislelizumab until they had no evidence of continued clinical benefit, had unacceptable toxicity, or 
withdrew informed consent. 
Endpoints:  
The study included only preliminary assessments of efficacy. The primary efficacy endpoint in Phase 2 
was ORR, defined as the percentage of patients in the study with either CR or PR, as assessed by 
investigators based on RECIST Version 1.1. There was no formal statistical testing for the efficacy 
endpoints; the efficacy analyses were descriptive only.  
Further efficacy endpoints evaluated comprised BOR, ORR, CBR, DCR, PFS, OS, and DOR. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics (supportive studies 001 and 102) 
The demographics and other baseline characteristics of patients with ESCC who were enrolled in 
Studies 001 and 102 reflected a population that was at a more advanced or metastatic disease stage 
and that had been heavily treated previously (the majority had received ≥ 2 lines of prior systemic 
therapy). In Study 001, the median age of the 26 ESCC patients was 61.5 years and 26.9% of patients 
were ≥ 65 years of age. Most patients were male (65.4%), Asian (73.1%), and had a baseline ECOG PS 
score of 1 (73.1%). Six patients (23.1%) had never smoked. In Study 102, the median age of the 26 
ESCC patients was 62.5 years, and 34.6% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. Most patients were male 
(88.5%) and had a baseline ECOG PS score of 1 (88.5%). Ten patients (38.5%) had never smoked.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for approval of tislelizumab for the treatment of 2L+ ESCC is based on the open-label, 
randomized, ICC-controlled single pivotal Phase 3 study BGB-A317-302 conducted in patients with 
unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic ESCC who progressed on or after prior systemic 
treatment. Overall, the study design is endorsed. Given the choice of chemotherapies in the 
comparator arm and considering that OS was selected as primary endpoint, the open-label study 
design is considered acceptable. Stratification factors for this study were region (Asia [excluding 
Japan] vs. Japan vs. EU/US), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and ICC option (paclitaxel vs. docetaxel vs. 
irinotecan), which are deemed adequate. 
In general, the applied inclusion and exclusion criteria selected an adequate population of patients with 
advanced or metastatic ESCC eligible for 2nd line treatment, although the population may be 
considered somewhat selected due to exclusion of patients with ECOG PS ≥ 2. Patients were enrolled 
regardless of their tumour PD-L1 expression level, which is generally acceptable. However, it would 
have been beneficial to analyse PD-L1 expression in all patients enrolled and to stratify patients by PD-
L1 expression status. Patients with active brain or leptomeningeal metastases, tumour invasion into 
adjacent organs and prior receipt of anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy were excluded from the study. 
Investigator-chosen chemotherapy was used for the comparator arm and included either paclitaxel, 
docetaxel or irinotecan monotherapy. These treatment options are considered acceptable as active 
comparator, since they were standard of care at the time of study initiation and still recommended as 
preferred options by current ESCC treatment guidelines (2022 NCCN Guidelines, Lordick et al. 2016). 
The respective treatment regimen was determined by the physicians prior to randomization. 
Overall survival was selected as primary endpoint and is endorsed, as OS represents the most 
persuasive outcome – both from a clinical and methodological point of view – and is adequate 
especially considering the dismal prognosis of ESCC patients having failed prior therapy. The selection 
of OS in the PD-L1-Positive Analysis Set (vCPS ≥ 10%) as key secondary endpoint is considered 
acceptable, but has been introduced late during the conduct of the study (see below). Other secondary 
efficacy endpoints (PFS, ORR, DOR, HRQoL, and DCR) are standard in oncology trials and generally 
acceptable, although an independent central review of PFS, ORR and DOR instead of the sole 
assessment by investigator would have been more persuasive and thus preferred. Nevertheless, since 
OS was selected as primary endpoint, the lack of independent central assessment of imaging endpoints 
can be considered acceptable.

The study was planned to enrol 500 patients in order to observe 400 deaths. This was expected to 
provide 82% power to detect an overall survival HR of 0.75 at the 1-sided significance level of 
α=0.025, corresponding to an improvement in median overall survival from 6 months to 8 months, in 
the ITT Analysis Set. Assumptions were well justified at the time of planning. It was originally planned 
to enroll 450 patients and this was amended in a late protocol amendment. 
In total, 512 patients were randomized 1:1 to tislelizumab treatment or ICC treatment.  
No estimand was defined for this study. The primary endpoint of OS was planned to be compared 
between tislelizumab and ICC arms in the ITT analysis set, by means of a stratified log-rank test, using 
a significance level of one-sided 0.025. The ITT set was planned to comprise all randomised subjects. 
The analysis was planned to be stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs 1) and ICC option 
(paclitaxel vs docetaxel vs irinotecan). 
In the absence of death, patients were planned to be censored either at the date that the patient was 
last known to be alive or the date of data cut-off, whichever comes earlier. 
The key-secondary endpoint OS in the PD-L1 positive analysis set was planned to be tested 
hierarchically after the primary endpoint. Only OS in the ITT and in the PD-L1 positive analysis sets 
were planned with multiplicity control, all further analyses are descriptive. 
A log-rank test stratified by selected stratification factors (ECOG and ICC option) was planned to be 
used to descriptively analyse the PFS differences between two treatment arms. Censoring rules are not 
fully supported, but sensitivity analyses were planned, some of which (sensitivity analysis II) are 
considered closer to a treatment policy estimand and are preferred. 
Recruitment and conduct of the study 
Study 302 was a global study which recruited patients from 11 countries/regions, including Asia, 
Europe and North America. The majority of patients was enrolled in China. In the ITT Analysis Set, a 
total of 512 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tislelizumab or ICC. More patients in the ICC arm 
as compared to the tislelizumab arm were randomized but not treated (6.3% vs. 0.4%) or withdrew 
from the study (11.3% vs. 2.3%) and more patients in the ICC arm (23.8%) as compared to the 
tislelizumab arm (11.4%) were exposed to study treatment for less than 1 month. While this is not 
ideal, tipping-point analyses provided reassurance that even with pessimistic assumptions the 
interpretation of the study would not have been substantially affected by this imbalance. 
At the data cutoff date of 1 December 2020, the median follow-up duration was longer in the 
tislelizumab as compared to the ICC arm (8.49 months vs. 5.8 months, respectively), which can be 
explained by patients in the ICC arm having more frequently discontinued the study early (e.g. due to 
death, withdrawals). 
The Applicant committed to provide the final analyses of OS post-authorization. The estimated 
timeframe for this submission is currently Q3 2024. 
There were 4 global amendments of the clinical study protocol for Study 302. The last amendment 
(Amendment Version 4.0, dated 20 March 2020 that introduced the removal of the interim analysis, an 
increase in sample size, and the addition of OS in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% as key secondary 
endpoint) was implemented after the last patient was randomized on 4 March 2020. The Applicant 
clarified the reasons for the late changes. (The Applicant clarified that these decisions were discussed 
with the Study Steering Committee in Jun-2019. As of 23-May-2019, only 17 patients were 
randomized in Europe/North America as compared to 330 patients in Asia. Due to concerns that the 
lack of geographically diverse population would likely not be acceptable for global registrational 
purposes, the decision was made to remove the interim analysis and to increase the sample size in 
order to allow enrolment of 100 patients from Ex-Asia. Moreover, the sample size was increased to

accumulate more OS events because the assumption of an OS HR was updated from 0.73 to 0.75 
based on KEYNOTE-181 data (published in Jan-2019). Investigators were informed about these 
changes via a Protocol Communication Letter; however, the implementation of the protocol 
amendment was delayed because further results from ongoing trials in advanced esophageal 
carcinoma were awaited to avoid multiple versions of protocol amendments within a limited period. 
Subgroup results of ATTRACTION-3 and ESCORT studies (published in Sep-2019 and Nov-2019) 
provided further information on the predictive relevance of PD-L1 expression status that had already 
been suggested by results from KEYNOTE-181. Following these publications, Protocol Amendment v4.0 
was released on 20-Mar-2020 that included the addition of OS in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% as a 
key secondary endpoint together with the removal of the interim analysis and the increase in sample 
size in the same version of the protocol amendment. 
It is clearly not endorsed that the former Sponsor BeiGene implemented changes (removal of interim 
analysis and increase in sample size) prior to the approval of the respective protocol amendment. 
However, the above presented rationale that is supported by reasonable documentation (“BeiGene 
Steering Committee Meeting Minutes” and “Protocol Communication Letter”) can be followed and do 
not raise concerns that the changes have been introduced based on knowledge of BGB-A317-302 study 
data. The Applicant confirmed that the PD-L1 cutoff selection of vCPS 10% using the Ventana PD-L1 
(SP263) assay was based on analyses of response data from ESCC cohorts from Studies_001 and 102 
and that PD-L1 expression levels in Study 302 were retrospectively evaluated by central laboratories 
after implementation of Protocol Amendment 4. ). Moreover, the Applicant provided an exploratory OS 
analysis according to Protocol Amendment v3.0 (dated 08-Nov-2018), i.e. before critical late changes 
had been introduced with Protocol Amendment v4.0. The results showed that statistical significance 
would have been also met with this analysis.  
Baseline characteristics 
The study population included in Study 302 was predominantly male (84.4%) and had a median age of 
62.0 years. The majority of patients was recruited at sites in Asia and thus, 79.7% of patients were 
Asian versus 18.9% being of White or Caucasian race. As the provision of tumour tissue (either 
archival tissue or fresh biopsy) was not strictly required for enrolment in this study, 19.3% of study 
participants presented with missing PD-L1 status.  
The applicant was seeking approval for tislelizumab for “the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after 
prior chemotherapy”. Considering that prior treatment with a platinum-based regimen was required for 
inclusion in Study 302 and that platinum-based therapy was ultimately used in 97.3% of patients, the 
Applicant agreed to revise the indication wording to read: “Tradename as monotherapy is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma after prior platinum-based chemotherapy”.  
Only 5% of patients included in Study 302 was diagnosed with locally advanced ESCC, the remaining 
patients had metastatic disease at the time of study entry. Accounting for the small sample size of 
patients with locally advanced disease, it is probably not possible to draw reliable conclusions on 
efficacy results of subgroup analyses, which are therefore not requested. The extrapolation of efficacy 
results from the metastatic setting is however deemed acceptable and the inclusion of locally advanced 
disease stage in the indication wording is agreed. Similarly, although no data are available for patients 
with advanced or metastatic ESCC beyond the 2nd line therapy setting (99.6% of patients included in 
Study 302 had received exactly 1 prior therapy), the extrapolation of efficacy results from 2nd line 
ESCC to later lines of therapy is considered acceptable and no strict limitation in the indication wording 
is warranted.

Several imbalances in baseline characteristics of patients have been identified between treatment 
groups and specifically in relevant subgroups by region (Asia vs. Europe/North America). In the ITT 
Analysis Set, the percentage of patients with PD-L1 expression status vCPS ≥10% was higher in the 
tislelizumab arm (31.3%) as compared to the ICC arm (24.2%). In contrast, PD-L1 expression in the 
ITT population was < 10% in 39.1% and 47.7% of patients in the tislelizumab and the ICC arm, 
respectively. Since higher response rates of checkpoint inhibitors have been described in patients with 
high(er) PD-L1 expression in the past, this imbalance might have biased measures of efficacy, 
resulting in favouring the tislelizumab over the ICC comparator arm.  
Comparing the Asia and Europe/North America population (see Table 3-3-6), patients in the Asia 
subgroup were younger as compared to those in the Europe/North America subgroup (median age of 
61.0 years versus 65.0 years, respectively). In addition, the Asian subgroup of patients included a 
higher percentage of males (88.9% versus 67.6%), a higher percentage of patients with ECOG PS 
scores of 1 (79.0% versus 62.0%), a lower percentage of patients with PD-L1 vCPS < 10% (47.5% vs. 
59.3%) while the percentage of patients with missing PD-L1 status was equally higher (21.5% vs. 
11.1%) and a higher percentage of patients having received neo-/adjuvant prior therapy (19.8% vs. 
2.8%) as compared to the Europe/North America subgroup. In general, these imbalances may yield 
uncertainties as regards to the external validity of the study.  
Finally, further imbalances were identified between treatment arms of the Europe/North America 
subgroup (PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10%: tislelizumab = 40.0% vs. ICC = 18.9% and ECOG PS 1: tislelizumab = 
58.2% vs. ICC = 66.0%), which could have confounded the results in the EU population.  
In order to address uncertainties deriving from above discussed imbalances in patients’ baseline 
characteristics, the applicant conducted a variety of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. These 
suggested a benefit of tislelizumab throughout the different subgroups investigated and mitigate 
concerns regarding a meaningful confounding impact of imbalances in patient characteristics. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary analysis of OS in the ITT population demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of 
tislelizumab over ICC control with an event rate of 77% and 83.2%, respectively (stratified HR = 0.7 
[95% CI: 0.57 – 0.85], p = 0.0001, median OS 8.6 months for tislelizumab vs. 6.3 months for ICC). 
Given the poor prognosis of patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC, an increase in median OS of 
2.3 months can be considered clinically meaningful. Reassurance was provided through tipping-point 
analyses that study results are robust despite the imbalance regarding drop-outs and withdrawals 
observed in this open-label study, an OS effect persisted even in very pessimistic scenarios of the 
tipping-point analysis. 
In contrast to the primary OS analysis, no significant benefit could be demonstrated for investigator-
assessed PFS in the ITT population (stratified HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.67 – 1.01; with p = 0.0292). 
Median PFS was shorter for tislelizumab (1.6 months) than for ICC (2.1 months), but KM curves 
separated late in favour of tislelizumab. More patients treated with tislelizumab had events of 
progressive disease (tislelizumab: 74.6% vs. ICC: 56.6%). Based on the number of events in the PFS 
and OS analyses, it can be concluded that a relevant portion of subjects died, but was censored in PFS 
analyses.  Contingency tables do not support the same interpretation as Kaplan-Meier curves and 
hazard ratios. It was concluded that an imbalance in (early) censoring may be the reason for the 
apparent contradiction of time-to-event analyses and contingency tables. Sensitivity analyses 
investigating the robustness of results from time-to-event analyses against potentially informative 
(early) censoring provided reassurance. The point estimate for the PFS effect remained positive even in 
very pessimistic scenarios. However, some uncertainty remains associated with censoring for new 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 119/165 
 
  
 
 
anticancer treatment or missed tumour assessments. When not censoring for either of these, the PFS 
point estimate was substantially reduced. 
In the ITT population, the investigator-assessed unconfirmed ORR was higher in the tislelizumab arm 
as compared to the ICC arm (20.3% vs. 9.8%). A relatively high percentage of patients in the ICC arm 
(24.6%) with BOR “could not be determined” is noted. Although the high proportion of missing values 
in the ICC arm is considered unfortunate, the number of patients with indeterminable response in the 
ICC arm may be explained by the number of patients randomized but not treated or withdrawn from 
study treatment (N = 45) and by the number of patients exposed to ICC for less than 1 month (N = 
57). Sensitivity analyses addressing this imbalance are requested. The applicant further conducted a 
post-hoc analysis using the confirmed response for assessment of ORR and BOR. Confirmed ORR was 
slightly lower as compared to unconfirmed ORR (15.2% in the tislelizumab arm vs. 6.6% in the ICC 
arm with an ORR difference of 8.6%). However, both analyses revealed higher response rates in 
patients treated with tislelizumab as compared to patients treated with ICC. In section 5.1 of the 
SmPC, only confirmed ORR is described, which is supported. 
Outcomes of HRQoL did not show clinically meaningfully differences between treatment arms in the ITT 
population.  However, results might be confounded by the knowledge of treatment assignment in the 
open-label study. 
Efficacy by region 
As discussed above, only 20% of patients in Study 302 were enrolled in Europe/North America. In 
order to allow an assessment of the adequacy of extrapolation of efficacy data to the EU population, 
subgroup analyses of the efficacy data in the ITT population by region were provided. For the primary 
endpoint OS, both the Asia and Europe/North America subgroup favoured the tislelizumab over the ICC 
arm. Median overall survival in the Asia subgroup was 8.5 months in the tislelizumab arm as compared 
to 6.3 months in the ICC arm (HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.90) and median overall survival in the 
Europe/North America subgroup was 11.2 months in the tislelizumab arm as compared to 6.3 months 
in the ICC arm (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.87). Similar results were obtained comparing subgroups 
of White and Asian race. Although the sample size in the subgroup of White patients or patients from 
Europe/North America was rather low (N = 44 - 55) and the study was not adequately powered for 
these subgroup analyses, the results obtained are reassuring and suggest a clinically relevant benefit 
of tislelizumab vs. ICC also for the EU population primarily relevant for this submission.  
Efficacy by PD-L1 status 
OS in patients with PD-L1 vCPS ≥ 10% was analysed as key secondary endpoint and showed a 
statistically significant and more pronounced treatment effect of tislelizumab with a stratified HR of 
0.49 (p = 0.0003) and a 4.9-month difference in median OS in favour of tislelizumab. Subsequently, 
post-hoc analyses of OS in patients with PD-L1 vCPS < 10% and missing status were performed. 
Hazard ratios in both subgroups favoured tislelizumab over ICC; however, the benefit of tislelizumab 
was apparently lower in the lower PD-L1 expression group (vCPS <10%: HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.62,1.12; 
missing: HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.49, 1.06). In view of the large sample size of the vCPS < 10% subgroup 
(62% of PD-L1 evaluable study population), the Applicant was asked to further evaluate the benefit in 
patients with PD-L1 negative or weak expressing tumours to justify a PD-L1 unrestricted indication. 
One of the concerns was related to the high proportion of missing PD-L1 status for 99 patients 
(19.3%). As collection of tumour tissue for PD-L1 testing (by Ventana PD-L1 SP263 assay) was not 
part of the eligibility criteria, no tumour tissue samples were submitted for 59 patients. Reasons for 
missing PD-L1 status among the remaining 40 patients included mostly testing failures. 
Further review of PD-L1 expression data after CSR finalization identified the use of additional 
unsuitable samples.  Based on the sample eligibility criteria specified in the Ventana PD-L1 diagnostic 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 120/165 
 
  
 
 
protocol, 49 samples had to be considered invalid for the data analyses. Thus, the proportion of study 
participants with missing PD-L1 status increased to 28.9% (n=148).  
Although retrospective reclassification of tissue samples as unsuitable cannot be endorsed, updated 
results by corrected PD-L1 expression status did not change meaningfully; thus, conclusions on 
efficacy by PD-L1 subgroups did not necessarily change. However, it is considered relevant that the 
numbers in small PD-L1 subgroups diminish further with increasing number of patients with missing 
data, making any conclusions on small subgroups even less reliable. 
Although only a marginal benefit was observed for the subgroup of patients with vCPS <10%, a 
positive B/R balance can be considered in view of the different and potentially more favourable safety 
profile as compared to the alternative chemotherapy options. Despite the methodological uncertainties 
related to cross-trial comparisons, it is notable that the data for the PD-L1 negative population in the 
pivotal study for nivolumab in 2L OSCC showed a similar outcome (results for PD-L1 TPS <1%: OS HR 
0.84; 95% CI 0.62, 1.14; PFS HR 1.3; 95% CI 0.97, 1.73; ORR 14% vs 18% for nivolumab vs 
chemotherapy control; ATTRACTION-3, Kato et al, Lancet Oncology, 2019). The reported prevalence of 
both PD-L1 negative populations were in the same range (62% for vCPS <10% in Study 302 based on 
the Ventana SP263 assay and 52% for TPS <1% in Study ATTRACTION-3 based on the PD-L1 IHC 28-
8 pharmDx assay). To further inform on the efficacy of tislelizumab in the PD-L1 negative subgroup, 
the Applicant provided additional subgroup analyses by baseline PD-L1 expression status with 
additional cutoffs (including vCPS levels of 5% and 1%).  
Tislelizumab data for the < 5% cutoff (OS HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.61, 1.3) could be seen as marginally 
worse compared to the < 10% cutoff (when comparing the upper 95% CI of the OS HR and the slightly 
less prominent separation of the OS KM curves) but cannot be considered relevantly different.  
In contrary, OS data for patients with a PD-L1 expression level of vCPS <1% indicate a detrimental 
effect (OS HR 1.32; 95% CI 0.65, 2.70; median OS 5.2 months vs 7.4 months for tislelizumab vs ICC). 
PFS HR is 0.9 (95% CI 0.44, 1.87) for the vCPS <1% subgroup. PFS KM curves beyond 2 months are 
minimal in favour of tislelizumab; however, with only very few patients still at risk after 2 months. Of 
note, there are 3 responses (including 1 CR) in the tislelizumab treatment group vs no response in the 
ICC group. Nonetheless, the large ORR difference of 18.8% appears to be impacted by the small 
sample size, considering the smaller ORR differences in the other subgroups (maximal 10.7% for vCPS 
≥10%). Drawing satisfactory conclusions on these data is considered difficult.  
A detrimental effect in OS as the clinically most relevant endpoint is observed in the subgroup with the 
lowest PD-L1 expression level. Given the large external evidence of a predictive value of PD-L1 
expression status in ESCC, the lack of benefit for patients without PD-L1 expression appears biological 
plausible. This is considered an important point in favour of a possible restriction of the indication to 
patients with at least a minimum PD-L1 expression of vCPS ≥ 1%. This would be also supported by the 
exploratory OS modelling approach which identified a “switch-to-efficacy’ point for patients with a PD-
L1 expression >0.5%.  
On the other hand, there are many factors that make such a decision questionable based on the 
available dataset. The subgroup of patients with vCPS <1% comprised 7.6% of the PD-L1 evaluable 
study population (n=16 in the tislelizumab arm vs n=23 in the ICC arm). A similarly low prevalence of 
10% has been also observed in the ESCC population of the Phase I/II studies. This is mainly due to the 
fact that data for the Ventana SP263 assay allowed a further discrimination in subgroups of patients 
with lowest PD-L1 expression level (as opposed to the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay used in the 
pivotal nivolumab study with a prevalence of 52% for the lowest cutoff of CPS <1%).  Nonetheless, as 
already discussed, the number of patients is further diminished as a consequence of deficiencies in the 
study designs. Given the predictive value of PD-L1 status in this disease setting, mandatory collection 
of tumour tissue, central testing and stratification for PD-L1 expression would have been appropriate to 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 121/165 
 
  
 
 
ensure adequate results by PD-L1 status. However, PD-L1 expression data were missing for about 30% 
of the study population.  
The number of patients with vCPS <1% are limited to 16 patients in the tislelizumab arm and no 
reliable conclusions can be drawn. Based on the given study design, PD-L1 status was not a 
stratification factor, the 1% cutoff was not pre-specified in the protocol, is not analytically validated, 
and differences in prognostic relevant baseline/disease characteristics are observed between the 
treatment arms in the vCPS < 1% subgroup which might have had an impact on the OS outcome. 
While OS data indicated a detrimental outcome, this was not replicated for the secondary endpoint of 
PFS (HR 0.9; 95% CI 0.44, 1.87) nor for ORR (formally response rates of 18.8% reported with 3 
responses in 16 patients). Finally, the different and overall slightly more favourable safety profile of 
tislelizumab as monotherapy can be taken into account and the fact that the study included an active 
comparator, even though the activity of chemotherapy seems rather modest in this disease setting 
(ORR of only 6.6% in the control arm).  
Based on the above considerations, a restriction of the indication to exclude patients with vCPS<1% is 
not appropriate. This refers also to the presented vCPS <5% cutoff, where no detrimental effect was 
observed. In addition, a positive B/R balance can be considered for the pre-specified vCPS <10 % 
cutoff considering the different (more favourable) safety profile as compared to the alternative 
chemotherapy options and the precedent unrestricted indication for nivolumab monotherapy in OSCC.  
Further to this, for the sake of improved readability, the term “recurrent” is removed from the initially 
applied indication wording. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
A clinically meaningful benefit in overall survival was demonstrated in the intended target population of 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic OSCC after prior platinum-based therapy.  
As Study 302 mainly enrolled patients from China (approx. 80%) and a variety of additional 
imbalances in baseline characteristics of patients were identified, uncertainties arose regarding the 
external validity of the study and the applicability of extrapolation of efficacy results to the EU 
population. However, the provided sensitivity and subgroup analyses within this submission are 
deemed to have sufficiently addressed these issues. In conclusion, there is currently no evidence of a 
meaningful differential treatment effect of tislelizumab in the European OSCC population eligible for 2nd 
line therapy. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety of tislelizumab monotherapy for the treatment of unresectable recurrent locally advanced or 
metastatic OSCC after prior systemic therapy (abbreviated as “2L+” in the following) is supported by 
safety data from the following 3 patient populations:

The pivotal Study 302 enrolled patients from 132 sites in 11 countries/regions. At the time of 
submission, Study 302 was ongoing with a cutoff date of 01 December 2020; randomization was 
completed on 11 Sep 2019 in Asia and 04 Mar 2020 in Europe/North America. For the tislelizumab arm 
median study follow-up was 8.49 months versus 5.80 months in the ICC arm. 6.3% (tislelizumab arm) 
vs. 0.4 % (ICC arm) remained on study treatment at the cutoff date (Source: CSR Table 9).

Analysis of adverse events 
In Study 302 all randomized patients having received at least 1 dose of study treatment are included 
in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS).  
All AEs were reported until 30 days after study treatment discontinuation or initiation of a new 
anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first, with the exception of imAEs that were reported for 90 
days after last dose of tislelizumab, regardless of whether or not the patient started a new anticancer 
therapy. 
The following tables are provided for the Safety Analysis Sets described above. Treatment emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) were coded by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) 
using MedDRA version 23.0. AEs were graded by the investigators using NCI CTCAE v4.03. Dose 
modification includes either dose interruption or dose delay for tislelizumab and dose interruption or 
dose delay or dose reduction for ICC. Patients with multiple events for a given PT and SOC were 
counted only once. For each row category, a patient with two or more adverse events in that category 
is counted only once.

Adverse drug reactions 
Selection of ADRs 
The clinical database of the studies where tislelizumab was administered either as monotherapy or 
combination therapy were screened for ADR candidates using an ADR screening tool. ADR candidates 
include two types of events namely pre-qualified ADR candidates and ADR candidates identified 
through numerical screening rules. 
• 
Pre-qualified ADR candidates 
Pre-qualified ADR candidates are events that are associated with the drug based on current knowledge. 
Pre-qualified ADR candidates were identified using the eCRS and Excel files produced by the Statistical 
programming and Quantative Safety groups. 
•  Numerical screening rule to identify other non-pre-qualified ADR candidates 
Other ADR candidates are events for which an excess (based on medical review) versus comparator is 
observed or for which reasonable frequency is observed under tislelizumab. These were identified using 
a numerical screening rule (i.e. algorithmically), based on all TEAEs. Within the randomized period 
subset of each pivotal study at MedDRA HLT and PT level the following selection criteria were applied: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
AEs with >2% higher incidence for tislelizumab vs. respective comparator arm 
AEs with lower bound of relative risk (between tislelizumab arm and comparator arm) 95% 
confidence interval >1.0. 
SAEs with >0.5% difference in incidence for tislelizumab vs. respective comparator arm. 
Drug-related AEs (any drug component) with >0.5% difference in incidence for tislelizumab 
vs. respective comparator arm. 
In addition, based on the respective monotherapy and the combination therapy safety pools, the 
following rules were applied to flag potential ADR candidates: 
• 
• 
AEs with >2% incidence 
AEs leading to tislelizumab discontinuation with >0.5% incidence. 
A medical assessment was also made on the laboratory toxicities from the laboratory data. 
All identified ADR candidates underwent medical review using the Bradford Hill criteria to assess the 
plausibility of a causal association between tislelizumab and these candidate ADRs. Event severity, 
relationship, pharmacological action, and the safety profile of other drugs with similar mechanism of 
action where all considered in relation to the Bradford Hill Criteria. 
Once a causal association has been medically established, the eCRS (case retrieval strategy) was 
updated with the proposed ADRs and an ADR table generated.  
Frequency of ADRs 
ADRs identified with tislelizumab in the monotherapy pool are shown in the following table.

•  Methodology to determine immune-related AEs (imAEs) – Study 302 
All reported immune-mediated treatment-emergent adverse events (imAEs) in Study 302 were 
confirmed. The process of identification of confirmed imAE followed a 2-step process: 
•  Step 1: Generation of Potential imAE List 
Potential imAEs were identified using a predefined list of MedDRA preferred terms (“Look-Up List”) 
based on imAE terms from other approved checkpoint inhibitors and published literature.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 141/165 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs in the tislelizumab arm with a coded MedDRA PT of the Look-Up List are forwarded for medical 
review provided the following criteria were met: 
o  The TEAE started on or after the date in which the first dose of tislelizumab was 
administered. 
o  The TEAE was linked with treatment with systemic corticosteroids, endocrine therapy, or 
other immunosuppressants recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF page. 
o  The systemic corticosteroids, endocrine therapy, or other immunosuppressants linked to 
the TEAE, must have started on or after the start date, and no later than the end date for 
the TEAE. With the exception of TEAEs of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, systemic 
corticosteroids must have started within 30 days of the TEAE start date. 
•  Step 2: Medical Evaluation of Potential imAE 
All potential imAEs are reviewed by two medical reviewers, or individuals with appropriate training and 
experience in performing medical review. The medical review is performed to rule out clear alternative 
etiologies of potential imAE cases identified in Step 1. The two reviewers evaluate potential imAE cases 
independently. They considered use of systematic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy, outcome of 
rechallenge, existence of alternative explanation and the investigator´s assessment of the immune-
related check box. If there were discrepancies between the 2 reviewers, adjudication was to be made 
by a third qualified medical reviewer. 
•  Methodology to determine imAEs in supportive studies 
The process for immune-mediated adverse event identification that was followed in Study 302 was 
different from the process followed for individual CSRs for supportive Studies 102, 001, 208, 204, and 
203. This difference derives mainly from different guidelines being used for identification in Step 1. 
Grade 1 and 2 events, AE considered as unrelated by investigator and most events not treated with 
corticosteroids were excluded. 
•  Methodology to determine adverse events of special interest (AESI) – Study 302 
The term ‘adverse events of special interest’ is used for both treatment arms to report ‘potential’ 
immune-mediated adverse event cases (corresponding to the above described Step 1). This is opposed 
to reported imAEs outputs which include only ‘confirmed’ (or ‘adjudicated’) immune-mediated adverse 
event cases that include the above described Step 2 and are reported only for the tislelizumab arm.  
In addition, infusion-related reactions are reported as adverse events of special interest.

Resolved includes both ‘Recovered/resolved’ and ‘Recovered/resolved with sequelae’ in the CRF. 
a A patient was considered as resolved in a category if, and only if, all events in the category from this patient 
were resolved. Percentage was based on the number of patients with at least one immune-mediated adverse 
event in the category. 
b Percentages were based on the number of immune-mediated adverse events in the category. 
Although the majority of imAE were observed within the first three months, there is a relevant 
proportion of events occurring later (with onset of single events even beyond 1 year after the first dose 
of treatment). Overall, 36.8% of imAEs had resolved in Study 302 at the time of data cutoff. In the all 
Doses All Indications populations, for 45.7% of patients at least one imAE category resolved (i.e. 
concurrent imAEs of other imAE categories might be ongoing), and in 39.1% of patients all imAEs 
resolved.

n is the number of patients with worsen toxicity grade compared with baseline. m is the number of patients with 
baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment.  
Laboratory data are reported up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Overall, no consistent, clinically meaningful differences could be observed by analyses of subgroups 
across age, gender, body weight, and mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment; however, 
interpretation of safety data by gender and hepatic impairment is hampered by the small proportions 
of subgroups with females (15.3%) and patients with hepatic impairment (9%) (please see clinical AR 
for additional tables of TEAEs by subgroups).

The majority of patients was Asian (about 80% in Study 302 and 70% in the All Doses All Indications 
Group). Numerically higher incidences of laboratory-related adverse events were reported in the Asian 
subgroup than in the White subgroup (incidence of investigations 58.2% for Asian vs. 21.1% for White 
in the tislelizumab arm of Study 302).  
TEAE by region 
More patients in Study 302 were enrolled in Asia compared with Europe/North America (78.8% versus 
21.2%); The two subgroups by region, Asia and Europe/North America*, were almost identical to the 
two subgroups by race, Asian and white. The findings for adverse events by region were very similar 
with that by race (please see clinical AR for Tables). * 1 patient enrolled in NA 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
For tislelizumab monotherapy, 18.3% of patients were tested positive for treatment emergent antidrug 
antibodies (ADA), and neutralising antibodies (NAb) were detected in 0.9% of patients of 1,916 ADA 
evaluable patients treated at the recommended dose of 200 mg Q3W. For tislelizumab combination 
therapy, ADA was detected in 24.0% of 492 evaluable patients and NAb in 1.4% of patients. Please 
see section 3.3.1.2 for a detailed assessment of immunogenicity.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data to support the MAA for tislelizumab monotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are based on the randomized, controlled, open-label 
Study 302. The pivotal study evaluated tislelizumab versus investigator´s choice of chemotherapy 
(ICC: paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan) in patients after 1 line of prior systemic therapy. Safety data 
are available from 255 patients in the tislelizumab arm and 240 patients in the ICC arm. 2L ESCC data 
are further complemented by 52 previously treated ESCC patients from two phase 1/2 studies (n=307 
2L+ ESCC in total) and a pooled safety dataset from patients treated with tislelizumab monotherapy in 
different dosing regimens and across different indications (n=1972; including ESCC, NSCLC, HCC, UC 
und r/r cHL). Of these 1534 patients were treated with tislelizumab in the dose regimen of 200 mg 
Q3W, the 200 mg Q3W All Indications pool that form the basis for most of the presented safety 
analysis. 
In principle, this amount of safety data can be considered adequate to describe the toxicity profile of 
tislelizumab. It is however noted that the pivotal Study 302 mainly recruited Asian patients (about 
80%) and did not enrol patients with more than one prior line of systemic chemotherapy (whereas the 
proposed 2L+ ESCC indication refers to patients after prior chemotherapy without restricting the use of 
tislelizumab to 2L).   
Median exposure to tislelizumab in Study 302 was longer than exposure to ICC (2.76 months vs. 1.49 
months, respectively). A notably higher number of patients received treatment for less than 1 month in 
the ICC arm (24%) compared to 11% in the tislelizumab arm. Reasons for treatment discontinuation 
during the first month were disease progression/deterioration, AEs and withdrawal by subject, all 
higher in the ICC arm. 
The safety of the medicinal product as monotherapy is based on pooled data in 1 534 patients across 
multiple tumour types who received 200 mg tislelizumab every 3 weeks. The most common adverse 
reaction was anaemia (29.2%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse reactions were anaemia (5.0%) 
and pneumonia (4.2%). 1.17% of patients experienced adverse reactions leading to death. The 
adverse reactions leading to death were pneumonia (0.78%), hepatitis (0.13%), pneumonitis (0.07%), 
dyspnoea (0.07%), decreased appetite (0.07%) and thrombocytopenia (0.07%). Among the 
1 534 patients, 40.1% were exposed to tislelizumab for longer than 6 months, and 22.2% were 
exposed for longer than 12 months. 
Most common AEs in the tislelizumab monotherapy group of Study 302 (≥ 15%) were anemia 
(31%), weight decreased (23%), cough (17%), pyrexia (16%), decreased appetite (16%), and 
constipation (15%). Lower incidences (difference ≥ 10%) compared to the ICC arm were reported for 
decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhoea, alopecia and haematological toxicities.   
The safety profile was overall comparable between the tislelizumab monotherapy groups (in 
Study 302, the 2L+ ESCC pool and the All Indications pools; differences reported in the All Indications 
population could be attributed to the different tumour types (e.g. lower rates for gastrointestinal 
disorders, but higher rates in renal and urinary disorders in the All Indications Population).  
Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported at lower incidences for tislelizumab than for ICC (46% vs 68%), mainly 
driven by lower rates of haematological toxicities. Dysphagia was the most common severe events in 
the tislelizumab arm (6.3%) and occurred at a higher rate than in the ICC arm (2.9%); similarly, other 
less frequent oesophageal PTs, such as oesophageal obstruction / stenosis and fistula were numerically 
higher in the tislelizumab arm than the ICC arm. However, as outlined in the responses to the LoQ, 
imbalances in baseline/disease characteristics might have impacted the frequencies of dysphagia and 
related esophageal PTs. 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 153/165 
 
  
 
 
 
Serious adverse events were reported at similar incidences between both treatment arms (42% and 
44%). Most common serious AEs for tislelizumab were pneumonia (7.1%), dysphagia (4.7%), 
oesophageal obstruction and pneumonitis (each 2.0%). Pneumonia occurred at the same frequency 
across both arms. Numerical higher incidences for tislelizumab compared to ICC were observed in the 
SOC of respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (11.4% vs 7.9% of patients) with differences 
driven by pneumonitis and immune-mediated pneumonitis (together 3.2% vs 0.8%), and dyspnoea 
and pneumonia aspiration (both 1.2% vs 0.4%); in addition, dysphagia (4.7% vs. 1.7%) and 
oesophageal obstruction / stenosis (together 3.2% vs. 0.4%) were observed at higher rates in the 
tislelizumab compared to the ICC arm. As expected for the ICC arm, higher incidences compared to the 
tislelizumab arm were mainly reported for serious haematological events.  
In Study 302, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported at a lower rate in the 
tislelizumab arm than in the ICC arm (19.2% vs 26.7%). The most frequent AEs in the tislelizumab 
arm were pneumonia (2.0%), pneumonitis, immune-mediated pneumonitis, and upper gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage (each 1.2%). Dose modifications occurred also less frequent in the tislelizumab arm 
(23%) than in the ICC arm (48%).  
TEAE leading to death were reported for 13.7% of patients in the tislelizumab arm and for 11.7% in 
the ICC arm (including AEs related to disease progression); in about 6% of patients in both arms an 
adverse event was reported as primary cause of death. Grade 5 AEs in at least 2 patients in the 
tislelizumab arm were pneumonia, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, general physical health 
deterioration, multiple organ dysfunction and death. Only a low proportion of approximately 3% of AEs 
leading to death were considered related by the investigators in both treatment arms.  
The incidences of related AEs are lower in the tislelizumab group of Study 302 compared to ICC 
across all categories (with the exception of related AEs leading to death that were reported with similar 
rates). Overall, tislelizumab related AEs in Study 302 reflected the AEs that were observed regardless 
of treatment relationship; however, there appeared to be a trend for investigators to consider AEs to 
be more frequently related to chemotherapy as opposed to tislelizumab. With the responses, the 
Applicant discussed that the knowledge about incidences of ADRs that were more frequently reported 
for chemotherapy than for checkpoint inhibitors likely impacted the causality assessment of specific 
AEs. Examples from other studies with checkpoint inhibitors confirmed a similar pattern.   
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for tislelizumab monotherapy that are included in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC are based on the “200 mg Q3W All Indications” dataset (N=1534). This dataset also includes 
indications for which no approval is currently foreseen in the EU. Nonetheless, given the same 
posology of tislelizumab, a pooled analysis across suitable studies is usually considered to provide the 
best estimate of frequency and thus, this approach can be considered acceptable.  
The methodology to determine ADRs (as described in the dossier) and the final selection of ADRs cis 
considered acceptable.   
In general, laboratory findings in Study 302 reflected the known safety profiles of each drug; 
haematological toxicities were reported more frequently for patients treated with chemotherapy, while 
increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP), CK and creatinine were more common for tislelizumab 
treated patients. 
Immune-related AEs 
Incidences of imAE 
22.4% of the patients in the tislelizumab group of Study 302 had an immune-mediated TEAE (18% in 
the pooled 200 mg Q3W dataset across indications). The most common imAEs (≥ 2%) in the 
tislelizumab arm of Study 302 were hypothyroidism (9%), pneumonitis (7.1%) and skin adverse 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 154/165 
 
  
 
 
 
reactions (2%). For 6.7% of patients imAEs were serious. 4.7% of patients experienced Grade ≥ 3 
imAEs (pneumonitis 1.6%, hepatitis and myositis/rhabdomyolysis each 0.8% and myocarditis and 
hypothyroidism each 0.4%). No imAE was fatal. ImAEs led to discontinuation of tislelizumab in 3.5%, 
in most patients ([20% of discontinuations]) due to pneumonitis; further reasons were 
myositis/rhabdomyolysis and myocarditis.   
As per the Applicant´s definition, all patients with immune-mediated hypothyroidism were treated with 
hormone therapy. All other patients with imAEs were treated with corticosteroids, none received an 
immunosuppressant. Among the 54 patients who experienced immune-mediated adverse events in the 
tislelizumab arm of Study 302, the events had resolved in 21 patients (38.9%) at the data cutoff date; 
similarly, for 39.1% of patients in the All Indication pool all imAEs resolved.  
Immune-related adverse reactions have been reported, including fatal cases, during treatment with 
tislelizumab (see section 4.8). The majority of these events improved with interruption of tislelizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune-related adverse reactions have also 
been reported after the last dose of tislelizumab. Immune-related adverse reactions affecting more 
than one body system can occur simultaneously. 
For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude 
alternative aetiologies, including infection, should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse 
reaction, tislelizumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered (see section 4.2 of the 
SmPC). Based on limited data from clinical studies, administration of other systemic 
immunosuppressants can be considered in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions are not 
controlled with corticosteroid use (see sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC). Upon improvement to 
grade ≤1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. 
Immune-related pneumonitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving 
tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Patients with 
suspected pneumonitis should be evaluated with radiographic imaging and infectious or disease-related 
aetiologies should be ruled out. 
Patients with immune-related pneumonitis should be managed according to the treatment 
modifications as recommended in Table 1-see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Immune-related hepatitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with 
tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis and changes in liver 
function. Liver function tests should be performed at baseline and periodically during treatment. 
Patients with immune-related hepatitis should be managed according to the treatment modifications as 
recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Immune-related skin rash or dermatitis have been reported in patients receiving tislelizumab. Patients 
should be monitored for suspected skin reactions and other causes should be excluded. Based on the 
severity of the skin adverse reactions, tislelizumab should be withheld or permanently discontinued as 
recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have been reported in patients receiving 
tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of SCARs (e.g. a prodrome of fever, 
flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions or progressive skin rash) and other causes should be excluded. For 
suspected SCARs (including severe erythema multiforme [EM], SJS or TEN), tislelizumab should be 
withheld and the patient should be referred to specialised care for assessment and treatment. If 
SCARs, including SJS or TEN, is confirmed, tislelizumab should be permanently discontinued (see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Immune-related colitis, frequently associated with diarrhoea, has been reported in patients treated 
with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis. Infectious and 
disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. 
Patients with immune-related colitis should be managed according to the treatment modifications as 
recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Immune-related endocrinopathies, including thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and 
type 1 diabetes mellitus, have been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. These may require 
supportive treatment depending on the specific endocrine disorder. Long-term hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT) may be necessary in cases of immune-related endocrinopathies. 
Patients with immune-related endocrinopathies should be managed according to the treatment 
modifications as recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Thyroid disorders, including thyroiditis, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, have been reported in 
patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored (at the start of treatment, periodically 
during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) for changes in thyroid function and 
clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Hypothyroidism may be managed with HRT without 
treatment interruption and without corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism may be managed symptomatically 
(see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of adrenal function and 
hormone levels should be considered. Corticosteroids and HRT should be administered as clinically 
indicated (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Hypophysitis has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. Monitoring of pituitary function and hormone 
levels should be considered. Corticosteroids and HRT should be administered as clinically indicated (see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been reported in patients treated with 
tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia and other signs and symptoms of 
diabetes. Insulin should be administered for type 1 diabetes. In patients with severe hyperglycaemia or 
ketoacidosis (grade ≥3), tislelizumab should be withheld and anti-hyperglycaemic treatment should be 
administered (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). Treatment with tislelizumab may be resumed when 
metabolic control is achieved 
Immune-related nephritis with renal dysfunction has been reported in patients treated with 
tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function (elevated serum creatinine), 
and other causes of renal dysfunction should be excluded. 
Patients with immune-related nephritis with renal dysfunction should be managed according to the 
treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Other clinically important immune-related adverse reactions were reported with tislelizumab: myositis, 
myocarditis, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, pericarditis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (see 
section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients with other immune-related adverse reactions should be managed according to the treatment 
modifications as recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated 
with PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with tislelizumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 156/165 
 
  
 
 
transplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with tislelizumab versus the risk of possible organ 
rejection should be considered in these patients. 
Severe infusion-related reactions (grade 3 or higher) have been reported in patients receiving 
tislelizumab as a single agent (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of infusion-related reactions. 
Infusion-related reactions should be managed as recommended in Table 1 -see section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded from clinical studies: baseline ECOG 
performance score greater than or equal to 2; active brain or leptomeningeal metastases; active 
autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that may relapse; any condition requiring 
systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other 
immunosuppressants within the 14 days prior to study treatment; active or untreated HIV; untreated 
hepatitis B or hepatitis C carriers; history of interstitial lung disease; administration of live vaccine 
within the 14 days prior to study treatment; infection requiring systemic therapy within the 14 days 
prior to study treatment; history of severe hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody. In the 
absence of data, tislelizumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. 
Methodology to determine imAEs 
Above reported incidences of immune-mediated TEAEs were confirmed events based on a 2-step 
process. Potential imAEs were identified by a prespecified list of MedDRA PT but were only taken into 
further consideration and forwarded to medical review if the TEAEs were treated with systemic 
corticosteroids, other immunosuppressants or endocrine therapy. Potential imAEs underwent a medical 
review to assess possible alternate aetiology in a second step.  
Deficiencies in the algorithm that were used to select potential imAEs were identified.  Insulin was 
inadvertently not included as endocrine therapy in Step 1 and, as a result, cases of diabetes treated 
with insulin were not captured. Moreover, fatal (grade 5) events which were not treated were not 
captured. Finally, events treated more than 30 days after the start date were not captured in Step 1 
nor were events where concomitant medication was administered prior to the event start date. The 
Applicant performed a targeted re-adjudication to correct the above identified gaps and provided 
updated results.  
The methodology of the determination of imAEs itself remained unchanged despite the corrections. The 
Applicant plans to implement a revised single, global methodology for tislelizumab imAE identification 
that will be based on a fully automated algorithmic methodology. This would address many of the 
concerns raised during the assessment of the imAEs. Applying this approach, all grade imAE were 
identified in about 30% of patients in the tislelizumab monotherapy pool in contrary to 17% with the 
currently used methodology (the proportion of patients with serious imAEs remained similar).  
Different approaches are currently used for the identification of imAEs across different ICIs with the 
consequence of partially relevant differences across imAE frequencies. Thus, an adaption of the 
methodology with the aim to identify imAEs more correctly (and ideally more consistently) is endorsed. 
It is however considered acceptable that the currently submitted imAE data are based on the original 
methodology, acknowledging that this approach has been also accepted for other ICIs approved in the 
EU.  
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 157/165 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Safety in special populations  
Overall, no consistent, clinically meaningful differences could be observed by analyses of subgroups 
across age, gender, body weight, and mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment; however, 
interpretation of safety data by gender and hepatic impairment is hampered by the small proportions 
of subgroups with females (15.3%) and patients with hepatic impairment (9%). Overall, it can be 
agreed that the safety profile of tislelizumab monotherapy does not appear to be significantly different 
between patients aged < 65 years and patients aged between 65 and 74 years. However the safety 
data for tislelizumab monotherapy in patients ≥ 75 years are limited (n=104 of 1972 patients in the All 
Doses All Indications monotherapy pool). This has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Race and region: The majority of patients treated with tislelizumab monotherapy was Asian (about 
80% in Study 302 and 70% in the All Doses All Indications Group). Higher incidences of laboratory-
related adverse events were reported in the Asian subgroup than in the White subgroup (incidence of 
investigations 58.2% for Asian vs. 21.1% for White in the tislelizumab arm of Study 302). A similar 
trend was observed in patients treated with chemotherapy and in the pooled dataset across 
indications. The Applicant was asked to discuss possible reasons such as worse tolerability of Asian 
patients or a possible underreporting in the White subgroup.  As outlined in the responses, no 
significant differences in the “more objective” laboratory safety evaluations were detected despite the 
lower frequency of laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs in White patients vs. Asian patients. 
Therefore, the apparent discrepancies observed are more likely explained by regional differences in 
interpretation of the clinical relevance of laboratory abnormalities and data do not sustain a different 
pattern of tolerability in different races. It is considered reassuring that, for example, incidences of 
leukopenia and neutropenia, which were reported with a notably lower frequency in the White 
subgroup compared to the Asian subgroup, were consistent between the pooled monotherapy 
population and a meta-analysis of studies with PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy. Frequency of AEs, 
other than laboratory abnormalities, was generally similar across regions which is not suggestive of a 
general pattern of underreporting in study sites enrolling White patients. Overall, the totality of the 
reported safety data does not further support concerns that the mainly in Asian patients derived 
results would not be applicable to European patients. 
2.7.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data for tislelizumab for the treatment of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC) generally reflect the known toxicity profile of checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy. No new 
safety issues have been identified.

The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.9.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 159/165 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The active substance is not included in the EURD list and a new entry will be required. The 
requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26-Dec-1019. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tevimbra (tislelizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
-it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
-it is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 
2011; 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Approved indication: Tevimbra as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Oesophageal cancer (OC) is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth most common cause of 
cancer-related death worldwide, with an estimated 604,100 new cases and 544,076 deaths (5.5% of 
all cancer mortality) observed in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 2020, accessed 04 March 2021). ECs are divided in 
two major histological subtypes: oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) or oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma (OAC). Although ESCC accounts for 
90% of cases of oesophageal cancer worldwide 
∼
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 160/165 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
(Abnet et al. 2018), mortality rates associated with EAC are rising and have surpassed those of OSCC 
in several regions in the EU (Castro et al. Ann Oncol 2014). Oesophageal carcinoma is rare in young 
people, while the incidence peaks in the seventh and eighth decades of life. The main risk factors for 
OSCC in Western countries include tobacco and alcohol consumption. 
Patients are often diagnosed late in the disease course and as such, most patients present with 
advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival for localized disease is 
32.0% but drops to 24.0% for regional disease and 6.1% for patients with distant metastases. Patients 
diagnosed or treated once OSCC has progressed face a very poor prognosis (Abraham et al 2020) and 
patients with advanced and/or metastatic disease having failed initial therapy are solely treated with 
palliative intent. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin/oxaliplatin/carboplatin plus fluoropyrimidines or 
taxanes) is usually offered as first-line palliative therapy aiming at an extension of survival (Lordick et 
al. 2016, Muro et al. 2019, NCCN 2020) of patients with good performance status. Unfit patients 
(ECOG PS > 1) are treated with best supportive care. 
In the 2nd line disease setting, single-agent palliative chemotherapy (taxanes, irinotecan) was 
commonly used in medical practice for patients with PS scores 0 - 1 (NCCN 2017) in the past. 
Response rates were however low with less than 20% of patients responding to treatment and median 
OS ranging from 3 to 7 months. Recently, nivolumab was approved (October 2020) as monotherapy 
for the treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic OSCC after prior 
fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The open-label study BGB-A317-302 randomly assigned 512 patients with advanced unresectable or 
metastatic OSCC who had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either tislelizumab or investigator’s choice chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan). All 
patients had received 1 prior standard of care chemotherapy regimens. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary analysis of OS in the ITT population demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of 
tislelizumab over ICC control with an event rate of 77% and 83.2%, respectively (stratified HR = 0.7 
[95% CI: 0.57 – 0.85], p = 0.0001, median OS 8.6 months for tislelizumab vs. 6.3 months for ICC). 
OS in in PD-L1 positive analysis set vCPS ≥10% was analysed as key secondary endpoint and showed 
a statistically significant and more pronounced treatment effect of tislelizumab with a stratified HR of 
0.49 (95% CI: 0.33 – 0.74; p = 0.0003) and a 4.9-month difference in median OS in favour of 
tislelizumab. 
A subgroup analysis of OS in the Europe/North America subgroup favoured the tislelizumab over the 
ICC arm with a median overall survival of 11.2 months in the tislelizumab arm compared to 6.3 
months in the ICC arm (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.87). 
EMA/CHMP/359838/2023  
Page 161/165 
 
  
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the PD-L1 negative subgroup (PD-L1 score <10%), the magnitude of effect was lower compared to 
PD-L1 positive subgroup with a stratified HR for OS of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.62 to 1.12), and a median 
overall survival of 7.5 months (95% CI: 5.5 to 8.9 months) and 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.8 to 6.9 
months) for the tislelizumab and ICC arms, respectively. This was reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidences of treatment-related AEs (73.3% vs 93.8%), all cause and treatment-related Grade ≥ 3 
AEs (46.3% vs 67.9% and 18.8% vs. 55.8%), treatment-related SAEs (14.5% vs 19.6%) and AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuations or dose modification (19.2% vs 26.7% and 22.7% vs 47.9%) 
were less frequent in the tislelizumab arm of Study 302 than in the investigator´s choice of 
chemotherapy (ICC) arm. Similar frequencies in both treatment arms were reported for all cause SAEs 
(41.6% vs 43.8%) and AEs leading to death (13.7% vs 11.7%).  
Most common AEs in the tislelizumab group of Study 302 (≥ 15%) were anaemia (30.6%), weight 
decreased (23.1%), cough (16.9%), pyrexia (16.1%), decreased appetite (15.7%) and constipation 
(15.3%).  
22.4% of patients in the tislelizumab arm of Study 302 had an immune-mediated TEAE. The most 
common imAEs (≥ 2%) in the tislelizumab arm were hypothyroidism (9%), pneumonitis (7.1%) and 
skin adverse reactions (2%). For 6.7% of patients imAEs were serious. 4.7% of patients experienced 
Grade ≥ 3 imAEs (pneumonitis 1.6%, hepatitis and myositis/rhabdomyolysis each 0.8% and 
myocarditis and hypothyroidism each 0.4%). No imAE was fatal. ImAEs led to discontinuation of 
tislelizumab in 3.5%. In the tislelizumab arm of Study 302, the events had resolved in 38.9% at the 
data cutoff date; similarly, for 39.1% of patients in the All Indication pool all imAEs resolved. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No safety data are available for tislelizumab in patients with ECOG PS >1 and after more than 1 prior 
line of therapy in Study 302 (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
There are only limited safety data in patients with ≥ 75 years (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.8.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study BGB-A317-302 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 
overall survival for tislelizumab compared to treatment with investigator’s choice chemotherapy in the 
overall study population of advanced or metastatic ESCC patients after prior platinum-based therapy. 
The benefit of tislelizumab is correlated with PD-L1 expression status; nonetheless a favourable B/R 
can be accepted in a PD-L1 unrestricted indication considering the different and potentially more 
favourable safety profile in comparison to the chemotherapy options in this disease setting.  
The described safety profile of tislelizumab monotherapy in the sought indication was as expected for 
PD-1 inhibitors without new safety concerns.

3.8.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the improvement in overall survival in the overall study population, the benefit of treatment 
with tislelizumab is considered to outweigh its associated risks.  
3.8.2.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Prior regulatory decisions and evaluations of B/R balance in this disease setting are considered relevant 
for this procedure.  
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Tevimbra as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior 
platinum-based chemotherapy is considered positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tevimbra is favourable in the following indication: 
Tevimbra as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally 
advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy.

information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Tevimbra in each Member State, the MAH must agree about the content and 
format of the Patient Card, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other 
aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority. 
The Patient Card is aimed at increasing the awareness of patients on the signs and symptoms relevant 
to the early recognition/identification of the potential immune-related ARs and prompt them about 
when to seek medical attention. It also contains prompts to enter the contact details of the physician 
and to alert other physicians that the patient is being treated with Tevimbra. The Patient Card is 
designed to be carried by the patient at all times and presented to any healthcare professional who 
may help them.

immune-related ARs) and infusion-related reactions, and the importance of notifying their 
treating physician immediately if symptoms occur. 
The importance of not attempting to self-treat any symptoms without consulting their healthcare 
professional first. 
The importance of carrying the Patient Card at all times and to show it at all medical visits to 
healthcare professionals other than the prescriber (e.g. emergency healthcare professionals). 
A warning message to inform healthcare professionals treating the patient at any time, including 
in emergency conditions, that the patient is being treated with Tevimbra. 
A reminder that all known or suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can also be reported to 
local regulatory authorities. 
The contact details of their Tevimbra prescriber. 
The Patient Card reminds patients about key symptoms that need to be reported immediately to the 
physician.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

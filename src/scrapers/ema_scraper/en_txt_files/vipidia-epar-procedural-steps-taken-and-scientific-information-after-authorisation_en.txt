Please refer to Scientific Discussion ‘Vipidia 
in order to update paediatric information following 
positive opinion of procedure P46/013 and 
confirmation of full compliance of PIP EMEA-000496-
PIP01-08-M08 (PIP decision: P/0257/2020) based on 
reports from study studies SYR-322_104 and SYR-
H/C/002182/II/0035’ 
A summary of paediatric studies agreed as part of the PIP 
is included in the SmPC. Use of Vipidia in the paediatric 
population is not recommended. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Results from study 402, a phase 3b, randomised, double-

results of study 402, a phase 3b, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study, 
designed to demonstrate that no excess risk of a 
major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) exists 
following treatment with alogliptin compared with 
placebo when added to standard of care in adults 
with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS). 
The MAH took this opportunity to propose 
consequential amendments to the RMP and to update 
its structure according to the new European Union 
(EU) template for RMPs.

blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study, which was

adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) exists following 
treatment with alogliptin compared with placebo when 
added to standard of care in adults with type II diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), are 
included in the SmPC. The primary endpoint of the study 
was achieved, demonstrating non-inferiority of alogliptin 
compared with placebo for the primary MACE composite. 
Therefore, in general, alogliptin was not associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Jyseleca is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Jyseleca may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX).

Ulcerative colitis 
Jyseleca is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with filgotinib should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis. 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
The recommended dose of filgotinib for adult patients is 200 mg once daily. 
In adults at increased risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy (see section 4.4), the recommended dose is 
100 mg once daily and may be escalated to 200 mg once daily in case of insufficient disease control. 
For long term treatment, the lowest effective dose should be used. 
Ulcerative colitis 
Induction treatment 
The recommended dose for induction treatment is 200 mg once daily. 
For patients with ulcerative colitis who do not show an adequate therapeutic benefit during the initial 
10 weeks of treatment, 12 additional weeks of induction treatment with filgotinib 200 mg once daily 
may provide additional relief of symptoms (see section 5.1). Patients who have not shown any 
therapeutic benefit after 22 weeks of treatment should discontinue filgotinib. 
Maintenance treatment 
The recommended dose for maintenance treatment is 200 mg once daily. 
In adults at higher risk of VTE, MACE and malignancy (see section 4.4), the recommended dose for 
maintenance treatment is 100 mg once daily. In case of flare of the disease, the dose may be escalated 
to 200 mg once daily. For long term treatment, the lowest effective dose should be used. 
Laboratory monitoring, and dose initiation or interruption 
Guidance for laboratory monitoring, and dose initiation or interruption is provided in Table 1. 
Treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is 
controlled (see section 4.4).

treatment and thereafter 
according to international clinical 
guidelines for hyperlipidaemia 
Elderly 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 65 years of age and older, the recommended dose is 100 mg 
once daily and may be escalated to 200 mg once daily in case of insufficient disease control (see 
section 4.4). For long term treatment, the lowest effective dose should be used.  
Ulcerative colitis 
In patients with ulcerative colitis aged 65 years of age and older, the recommended dose is 200 mg 
once daily for the induction treatment and 100 mg once daily for maintenance treatment (see 
section 4.4). In case of flare of the disease, the dose may be escalated to 200 mg once daily. For long 
term treatment, the lowest effective dose should be used. Filgotinib is not recommended in patients 
aged 75 years and older as there is no data in this population. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
[CrCl] ≥ 60 mL/min). A dose of 100 mg of filgotinib once daily is recommended for patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to < 60 mL/min). Filgotinib has not been studied in 
patients with end stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min) and is therefore not recommended for use in 
these patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A 
or B). Filgotinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) and is 
therefore not recommended for use in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of filgotinib in children under the age of 18 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available.

Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Jyseleca can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). It has not been studied if tablets can be 
split, crushed, or chewed, and it is recommended that tablets are swallowed whole. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Filgotinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available in patients: 
-65 years of age and older; 
-patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors 
(such as current or past long-time smokers); 
-patients with malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy) 
Immunosuppressive medicinal products 
Combination of filgotinib with other potent immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, tacrolimus, 
biologics or other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors is not recommended as a risk of additive 
immunosuppression cannot be excluded. 
Infections 
Infections, including serious infections, have been reported in patients receiving filgotinib. The most 
frequent serious infection reported with filgotinib was pneumonia (see section 4.8). Among 
opportunistic infections, TB, oesophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis were reported with 
filgotinib. 
The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating filgotinib in patients: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
with chronic or recurrent infection 
who have been exposed to TB 
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection 
who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses; or 
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. 
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infections during 
and after filgotinib treatment. If an infection develops during treatment with filgotinib, the patient 
should be carefully monitored and filgotinib treatment should be temporarily interrupted if the patient 
is not responding to standard antimicrobial therapy. Filgotinib treatment may be resumed once the 
infection is controlled. 
As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly and in the diabetic populations in general, 
caution should be used when treating the elderly and patients with diabetes. In patients 65 years of age 
and older, filgotinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available (see section 
4.2).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tuberculosis 
Patients should be screened for TB before initiating filgotinib. Filgotinib should not be administered to 
patients with active TB (see section 4.3). In patients with latent TB, standard antimycobacterial 
therapy should be initiated before administering filgotinib. 
Patients should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients 
who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating treatment. 
Viral reactivation 
Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in 
clinical studies (see section 4.8). In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the risk of herpes zoster 
appeared to be higher in female patients, Asian patients, patients ≥ 50 years of age, patients with a 
medical history of herpes zoster, patients with a medical history of chronic lung disease and patients 
treated with filgotinib 200 mg once daily. If a patient develops herpes zoster, filgotinib treatment 
should be temporarily interrupted until the episode resolves. 
Screening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed in accordance with 
clinical guidelines before starting and during treatment with filgotinib. Patients who were positive for 
both hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus RNA were excluded from clinical studies. Patients who 
were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B virus DNA were excluded from clinical 
studies. 
Malignancy 
Lymphoma and other malignancies have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including 
filgotinib. In a large randomised active-controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, 
a higher rate of malignancies, particularly lung cancer, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC) was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
In patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, or with other 
malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy), filgotinib should only be 
used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.  
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with filgotinib. Periodic skin examination is 
recommended for all patients, particularly those who are at increased risk for skin cancer. 
Haematological abnormalities 
ANC < 1 × 109 cells/L (see section 4.8) and ALC < 0.5 × 109 cells/L were reported in ≤ 1% of patients 
in the rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies and in < 3% of patients in the ulcerative colitis clinical 
studies. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with an 
ANC < 1 × 109 cells/L, ALC < 0.5 × 109 cells/L or haemoglobin < 8 g/dL observed during routine 
patient management (see section 4.2). 
Vaccinations 
Use of live vaccines during, or immediately prior to, filgotinib treatment is not recommended. It is 
recommended that immunisations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, be updated in 
agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating filgotinib treatment. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lipids 
Treatment with filgotinib was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters, including 
total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, while low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
levels were slightly increased (see section 4.8). LDL cholesterol returned to pre-treatment levels in the 
majority of patients who started statin therapy while taking filgotinib. The effect of these lipid 
parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined (see 
section 4.2 for monitoring guidance). 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
Events of MACE have been observed in patients taking filgotinib. 
In a large randomised active-controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients 50 years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate 
of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke, was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF 
inhibitors. 
Therefore, in patients 65 years of age and older, patients who are current or past long-time smokers, 
and patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors, 
filgotinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
Events of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in 
patients receiving JAK inhibitors including filgotinib.  
In a large randomised active-controlled study of tofacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients 50 years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a dose 
dependent higher rate of VTE including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
(PE) was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
In patients with cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors (see also section 4.4 “Major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE)” and “Malignancy”) filgotinib should only be used if no suitable 
treatment alternatives are available.  
In patients with known VTE risk factors other than cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors, 
filgotinib should be used with caution. VTE risk factors other than cardiovascular or malignancy risk 
factors include previous VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, use of combined 
hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, inherited coagulation disorder.  
Patients should be re-evaluated periodically during filgotinib treatment to assess for changes in VTE 
risk. 
Promptly evaluate patients with signs and symptoms of VTE and discontinue filgotinib in patients 
with suspected VTE, regardless of dose. 
Use in patients 65 years of age and older 
Considering the increased risk of MACE, malignancies, serious infections, and all-cause mortality in 
patients 65 years of age and older, as observed in a large randomised study of tofacitinib (another JAK 
inhibitor), filgotinib should only be used in these patients if no suitable treatment alternatives are 
available.

Lactose content 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on filgotinib 
Filgotinib is primarily metabolised by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2), which can be inhibited in vitro by 
medicinal products such as fenofibrate, carvedilol, diltiazem or simvastatin. The clinical relevance of 
this interaction is unknown. 
Effect of filgotinib on other medicinal products 
Filgotinib is not a clinically relevant inhibitor or inducer of most enzymes or transporters commonly 
involved in interactions such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 
(UGT). 
In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of filgotinib to induce CYP2B6. In vivo 
induction cannot be excluded. 
In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of filgotinib to induce or inhibit CYP1A2. No 
clinical studies have been performed to investigate interactions with CYP1A2 substrates and therefore 
the potential in vivo effect of concomitant induction and inhibition of CYP1A2 by filgotinib is 
unknown. Caution is recommended when filgotinib is co-administered with CYP1A2 substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index. 
In a clinical pharmacology study, there was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the combined 
contraceptive ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel when co-administered with filgotinib; thus no dose 
adjustment of oral contraceptives is required. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 1 week 
after cessation of filgotinib treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgotinib in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Based on findings in animals, filgotinib may cause foetal harm and is therefore contraindicated during 
pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether filgotinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to breastfed newborns/infants 
cannot be excluded. Therefore, Jyseleca should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
In animal studies, decreased fertility, impaired spermatogenesis, and histopathological effects on male 
reproductive organs were observed (see section 5.3). The data from two dedicated Phase 2 clinical 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies (MANTA and MANTA RAy, n=240) to evaluate the human testicular safety in men with 
inflammatory arthritis diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases did not reveal a difference between 
treatment groups in the proportion of patients who had a 50% or more decrease from baseline in semen 
parameters at week 13 (pooled primary endpoint: filgotinib 6.7%, placebo 8.3%) and at week 26. 
Further, the data did not show any relevant changes in sex hormone levels or change from baseline in 
semen parameters across treatment groups. Overall, these clinical data were not suggestive of 
filgotinib-related effects on testicular function. 
Animal studies did not indicate effects with respect to fertility in females. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Filgotinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients 
should be advised that dizziness has been reported during treatment with Jyseleca (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea (3.5%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(URTI, 3.3%), urinary tract infection (UTI, 1.7%), dizziness (1.2%) and lymphopenia (1.0%). 
Ulcerative colitis 
In general, the overall safety profile observed in filgotinib-treated patients with ulcerative colitis was 
generally consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions are based on clinical studies (Table 2). The adverse reactions are 
listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100).

Laboratory changes 
Creatinine 
An increase in serum creatinine occurred with filgotinib treatment. At week 24 in the Phase 3 studies 
(FINCH 1, 2, and 3), the mean (SD) increase from baseline in serum creatinine was 0.07 (0.12) and 
0.04 (0.11) mg/dL for filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg, respectively. Mean creatinine values remained 
within the normal range. 
Lipids 
Treatment with filgotinib was associated with dose-dependent increases in total cholesterol and HDL 
levels, while LDL levels were slightly increased. LDL/HDL ratios were generally unchanged. Lipid 
changes were observed within the first 12 weeks of filgotinib treatment and remained stable thereafter. 
Serum phosphate 
Generally mild, transient or intermittent, and dose-dependent decreases in serum phosphate levels 
occurred during treatment with filgotinib and resolved without discontinuation of treatment. At 
week 24 in the Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1, 2, and 3), serum phosphate values of less than 2.2 mg/dL 
(the lower limit of normal) were reported in 5.3% and 3.8% of subjects receiving filgotinib 200 mg 
and 100 mg, respectively; no values below 1.0 mg/dL were reported. 
In placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies with background DMARDs (FINCH 1 and FINCH 2) through 
12 weeks, serum phosphate levels of less than 2.2 mg/dL were reported in 1.6%, 3.1%, and 2.4% in 
the placebo, filgotinib 200 mg, and filgotinib 100 mg groups, respectively. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
In placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs (FINCH 1, FINCH 2, DARWIN 1, and 
DARWIN 2), the frequency of infection over 12 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg group was 18.1% 
compared to 13.3% in the placebo group. In the MTX-controlled study FINCH 3, the frequency of 
infection over 24 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy and filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX groups 
was 25.2% and 23.1%, respectively, compared to 24.5% in the MTX group. The overall 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of infections for the filgotinib 200 mg group across all seven 
Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies (2,267 patients) was 26.5 per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE). 
In placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, the frequency of serious infection over 
12 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg group was 1.0% compared to 0.6% in the placebo group. In the 
MTX-controlled study FINCH 3, the frequency of serious infection over 24 weeks in the filgotinib 
200 mg monotherapy and filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX groups was 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, 
compared to 1.0% in the MTX group. The overall EAIR of serious infections for the filgotinib 200 mg 
group across all seven Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies (2,267 patients) was 1.7 per 100 PYE. The most 
common serious infection was pneumonia. The EAIR of serious infections remained stable with 
long-term exposure. 
In rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, there was a higher incidence of serious infections in patients 
aged 65 years and older. 
In placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, the frequencies of infectious ADRs over 
12 weeks for filgotinib 200 mg compared to placebo were: URTI (3.3% versus 1.8%), UTI (1.7% 
versus 0.9%), pneumonia (0.6% versus 0.4%), and herpes zoster (0.1% versus 0.3%). Most of the 
herpes zoster events involved a single dermatome and were non-serious. The overall EAIR of herpes 
zoster across all seven Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies (2 267 and 1 647 total patients for 200 mg and 
100 mg, respectively) was 1.6 and 1.1 per 100 PYE in the 200 mg group and 100 mg group, 
respectively.

Ulcerative colitis 
The types of serious infections in the ulcerative colitis clinical studies were generally similar to those 
reported in the rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies with filgotinib monotherapy treatment groups. 
Across the two placebo-controlled induction studies, the frequency of serious infections was 0.6% in 
the filgotinib 200 mg group, 1.1% in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 1.1% in the placebo group. In 
the placebo-controlled maintenance study, the frequency of serious infections in the filgotinib 200 mg 
group was 1%, compared to 0% in the respective placebo group. In the maintenance study filgotinib 
100 mg group, the frequency of serious infections was 1.7%, compared with 2.2% in the respective 
placebo group. 
Opportunistic infections (excluding TB) 
In rheumatoid arthritis placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, there were no 
opportunistic infections over 12 weeks in the filgotinib 200 mg group or the placebo group. In the 
MTX-controlled study FINCH 3, the frequency of opportunistic infections over 24 weeks was 0, 0.2%, 
and 0 in the filgotinib 200 mg monotherapy, filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX, and MTX groups, 
respectively. The overall EAIR of opportunistic infections for the filgotinib 200 mg group across all 
seven Phase 2 and 3 rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies (2 267 patients) was 0.1 per 100 PYE. 
Nausea 
Nausea was generally transient and reported during the first 24 weeks of filgotinib treatment. 
Creatine phosphokinase 
Dose-dependent increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) occurred within the first 12 weeks of 
filgotinib treatment and remained stable thereafter. At week 24 in the Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1, 2, 
and 3), the mean (SD) increase from baseline in CPK was -16 (449), 61 (260), and 33 (80) U/L for 
placebo, filgotinib 200 mg and 100 mg, respectively. 
In placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies with background DMARDs (FINCH 1 and FINCH 2) through 
12 weeks, CPK elevations > 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.3% 
of patients in the placebo, filgotinib 200 mg, and filgotinib 100 mg groups, respectively. Most 
elevations > 5 × ULN did not require treatment discontinuation. 
Experience from long-term extension studies 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
In the long-term extension study DARWIN 3, among patients enrolled from DARWIN 1 (N = 497), 
238 patients received filgotinib 200 mg once a day for a median duration of 4.4 years; among patients 
enrolled from DARWIN 2 (N = 242), 234 patients received filgotinib 200 mg once a day for a median 
duration of 4.4 years. In the long-term extension study FINCH 4, 1,530 patients received filgotinib 
200 mg once daily and 1,199 patients received filgotinib 100 mg once daily for a median duration of 
1.5 years. The safety profile of filgotinib was similar to that in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. 
Ulcerative colitis 
In the long-term extension study (SELECTION LTE) in patients who participated in the SELECTION 
study, patients received filgotinib 200 mg (N = 871), filgotinib 100 mg (N = 157), or placebo 
(N = 133) for median durations of 55, 36, and 32 weeks, respectively. The safety profile of filgotinib 
was similar to that in the SELECTION induction and maintenance studies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Filgotinib has been administered in clinical studies following single and once daily administration up 
to 450 mg without dose-limiting toxicity. Adverse reactions were comparable to those seen at lower 
doses and no specific toxicities were identified. Pharmacokinetic data following a single dose of 
100 mg filgotinib in healthy subjects indicate that approximately 50% of the administered dose is 
eliminated within 24 hours of dosing and 90% of the dose is eliminated within 72 hours. In case of an 
overdose, it is recommended that a patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. 
Treatment of overdose with filgotinib consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of 
vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. It is unknown whether filgotinib 
can be removed by dialysis.

L04AA45 
Mechanism of action 
Filgotinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and reversible inhibitor of the JAK family. 
JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor 
interactions on the cellular membrane. JAK1 is important in mediating inflammatory cytokine signals, 
JAK2 in mediating myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis and JAK3 plays critical roles in immune 
homeostasis and lymphopoiesis. Within the signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate 
signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity 
including gene expression. Filgotinib modulates these signalling pathways by preventing the 
phosphorylation and activation of STATs. In biochemical assays, filgotinib preferentially inhibited the 
activity of JAK1 and showed > 5-fold higher potency of filgotinib for JAK1 over JAK2, JAK3 and 
TYK2. In human cellular assays, filgotinib preferentially inhibited JAK1/JAK3-mediated signalling 
downstream of the heterodimeric cytokine receptors for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-15, 
JAK1/2-mediated IL-6, and JAK1/TYK2-mediated type I interferons, with functional selectivity over 
cytokine receptors that signal via pairs of JAK2 or JAK2/TYK2. GS-829845, the primary metabolite 
of filgotinib, was approximately 10-fold less active than filgotinib in in vitro assays, while exhibiting a 
similar JAK1 preferential inhibitory activity. In an in vivo rat model, the overall pharmacodynamic 
effect was predominantly driven by the metabolite. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT1 phosphorylation 
Filgotinib administration resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT1 
phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects. Filgotinib administration did not affect 
JAK2-associated GM-CSF induced STAT5 phosphorylation. 
Immunoglobulins 
In FINCH 1, 2, and 3, the median and interquartile ranges for serum IgG, IgM, and IgA values 
remained largely within the normal reference ranges through 24 weeks of treatment with filgotinib in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis and through 58 weeks of treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
Haematologic effects 
In FINCH 1, 2, and 3 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with filgotinib was associated 
with a small, transient increase in mean ALC that remained within normal reference ranges and 
gradually returned to at or near baseline levels with continued treatment by week 12. In FINCH 1, 2, 
and 3, median haemoglobin values remained stable within the normal range through 24 weeks of 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
filgotinib treatment. A slight decrease in median platelet counts occurred within the first 4 weeks of 
filgotinib treatment and remained stable thereafter through 24 weeks. Median platelet counts remained 
within the normal range. 
In SELECTION, in patients with ulcerative colitis, median haemoglobin values remained stable 
through 58 weeks of filgotinib treatment. 
C-reactive protein 
Decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed as early as 2 weeks after starting 
treatment with filgotinib and were maintained through 24 weeks of treatment in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis and through 58 weeks of treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
The efficacy and safety of filgotinib once daily were assessed in three Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1, 2, 
and 3). These were randomised, double-blind, multicentre studies in patients with moderate to severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 criteria. 
FINCH 1 was a 52-week study in 1 755 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate 
response to MTX. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily, filgotinib 100 mg once daily, 
adalimumab every 2 weeks, or placebo, all added to stable background MTX. At week 24, patients 
receiving placebo were re-randomised to filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg once daily through week 52. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 12. 
FINCH 2 was a 24-week study in 448 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate 
response to bDMARDs. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily, filgotinib 100 mg once daily, 
or placebo, all with a continued stable background dose of conventional synthetic DMARD(s) 
(csDMARD[s]: MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide). The primary endpoint was 
the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 12. 
FINCH 3 was a 52-week study in 1 249 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were naïve to MTX 
therapy. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily plus MTX once weekly, filgotinib 100 mg once 
daily plus MTX once weekly, filgotinib 200 mg (monotherapy) once daily, or MTX (monotherapy) 
once weekly. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response 
at week 24. 
Clinical response 
Higher response rates versus placebo or MTX were seen at week 2 for ACR20, and responses were 
maintained through week 52. 
Treatment with filgotinib 200 mg resulted in improvements in all individual ACR components, 
including tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessments, Health 
Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), pain assessment and high sensitivity CRP, 
compared to placebo or MTX. In two of the Phase 3 studies (FINCH 1 and FINCH 2), the comparison 
(versus placebo) was carried out on top of MTX or csDMARD(s) (see above). 
Low disease activity and remission 
Across the Phase 3 studies, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg 
plus MTX or other csDMARD achieved low disease activity and/or remission (DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 and 
DAS28-CRP < 2.6) at weeks 12 and 24 as compared to placebo or MTX. Filgotinib 200 mg was 
non-inferior to adalimumab at week 12 for DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2 in FINCH 1 (Table 3).

Radiographic response 
Inhibition of progression of structural joint damage was assessed using the modified Total Sharp Score 
(mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score, at weeks 24 and 52 in 
FINCH 1 and FINCH 3. 
In patients who had an inadequate response to MTX, treatment with filgotinib plus MTX resulted in 
statistically significant inhibition of progression of structural joint damage compared to placebo plus 
MTX at week 24 (Table 4). Analyses of erosion and joint space narrowing scores were consistent with 
the overall scores.

Health status outcomes were assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). Patients treated with 
filgotinib 200 mg plus MTX or other csDMARD demonstrated numerically greater improvement from 
baseline in the physical component summary score of SF-36 as well as in the Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score (FACIT-F) at weeks 12 and 24 compared to placebo plus 
MTX/csDMARD or MTX. 
Long-term efficacy 
In a long-term Phase 2 open-label extension study (DARWIN 3), continued and durable responses 
were observed, with ACR20/50/70 responses maintained for up to 3 years in patients who received 
filgotinib 200 mg as monotherapy or with MTX. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ulcerative colitis 
The efficacy and safety of filgotinib once daily were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled combined Phase 2b/3 study (SELECTION) in patients with moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis (Mayo Clinic Score 6 to 12; endoscopy subscore ≥ 2; rectal bleeding 
subscore ≥ 1; stool frequency subscore ≥ 1; and Physician’s Global Assessment subscore ≥ 2). 
SELECTION included two induction studies (UC-1 and UC-2) followed by a maintenance study 
(UC-3), with a total duration of 58 weeks of therapy. Patients were permitted to use stable doses of 
concomitant therapies for ulcerative colitis, including oral aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids 
(prednisone equivalent dose up to 30 mg/day), and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-MP, or 
methotrexate). 
UC-1 was an 11-week induction study in 659 patients with ulcerative colitis who were naïve to 
biologic therapy and had an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to corticosteroids or 
immunomodulators. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily (N = 245), filgotinib 100 mg once 
daily (N = 277), or placebo (N = 137). At baseline, 56% of patients had an endoscopic subscore of 3; 
24% were receiving oral corticosteroids only, 23% immunomodulators only, 7% corticosteroids and 
immunomodulators, and 47% neither corticosteroids nor immunomodulators. 
UC-2 was an 11-week induction study in 689 patients with ulcerative colitis who were 
biologic-experienced and had an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to a tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) blocker or vedolizumab. Patients received filgotinib 200 mg once daily 
(N = 262), filgotinib 100 mg once daily (N = 285), or placebo (N = 142). At baseline, 78% of patients 
had an endoscopic subscore of 3; 85% had failed at least 1 prior TNF blocker, 52% had failed 
vedolizumab, and 43% had failed at least 1 TNF blocker and vedolizumab; 36% were receiving oral 
corticosteroids only, 13% immunomodulators only, 10% corticosteroids and immunomodulators, and 
41% neither corticosteroids nor immunomodulators. 
The primary endpoint for UC-1 and UC-2 was the proportion of patients who achieved clinical 
remission at week 10. Clinical remission was defined as MCS endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 
(endoscopy subscore of 0 defined as normal or inactive disease and subscore of 1 defined as presence 
of erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and no friability), rectal bleeding subscore of 0 (no rectal 
bleeding), and at least a one point decrease in stool frequency subscore from baseline to achieve 0 or 
1. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included MCS remission, endoscopic remission, and histologic 
remission at week 10. 
UC-3 was a 47-week maintenance study in 558 patients with ulcerative colitis who achieved clinical 
response or remission at week 10 from filgotinib in UC-1 (N = 320) or UC-2 (N = 238). Clinical 
response was defined as a decrease in MCS of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% decrease from baseline, with an 
accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore 
of 0 or 1. Patients were re-randomised at week 11 to receive their induction dose of filgotinib or 
placebo through week 58. As in UC-1 and UC-2, patients were permitted to use stable doses of oral 
aminosalicylates or immunomodulators; however, corticosteroid tapering was required three weeks 
after entering this study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved clinical 
remission at week 58. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were MCS remission, sustained clinical 
remission, 6-month corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and histologic 
remission at week 58. 
Clinical outcomes 
Across the UC-1 and UC-2 studies, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving filgotinib 
200 mg achieved clinical remission at week 10 as compared to placebo (Table 6). A significantly 
greater proportion of biologic-naïve patients (UC-1) receiving filgotinib 200 mg achieved MCS 
remission, endoscopic remission, and histologic remission at week 10 as compared to placebo 
(Table 6). 
Efficacy in the filgotinib 100 mg group as compared to placebo was not statistically significant at 
week 10 in either UC-1 or UC-2.

Endoscopic response 
Endoscopic response was defined as an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1. The proportion of patients in 
UC-1 and UC-2 achieving an endoscopic response was 33.9% and 17.2%, respectively, for patients 
receiving filgotinib 200 mg compared with 20.4% and 7.7%, respectively, for patients receiving 
placebo, at week 10. In UC-3, 40.7% of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg versus 15.3% of patients 
receiving placebo achieved endoscopic response at week 58. 
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes 
Patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg reported increases (improvements) in the total and all four domain 
scores of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ([IBDQ] bowel symptoms, systemic 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
function, emotional function, and social function) at week 10 in UC-1 and UC-2, and at week 58 in 
UC-3. 
Long-term extension study 
Patients who did not achieve clinical response or remission at week 10 in UC-1 or UC-2 had the 
option to receive open-label filgotinib 200 mg in the SELECTION LTE study. After 12 weeks of 
additional treatment with filgotinib 200 mg in the SELECTION LTE study, the proportion of patients 
from UC-1 and UC-2 achieving partial MCS remission was 17.1% (12/70) and 16.7% (15/90), 
respectively and partial MCS response was achieved by 65.7% (46/70) and 62.2% (56/90), 
respectively. Partial MCS remission was defined as partial MCS ≤ 1 and partial MCS response was 
defined as a reduction of ≥ 2 in partial MCS and at least 30% reduction from the induction baseline 
score, with an accompanying decrease of ≥ 1 in the rectal bleeding subscore or an absolute rectal 
bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
filgotinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of chronic idiopathic 
arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis) and in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, filgotinib was absorbed quickly and its median peak plasma 
concentration was observed 2 to 3 hours postdose after multiple dosing; the median peak plasma 
concentrations of its primary metabolite GS-829845 were observed 5 hours postdose after multiple 
dosing. Filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures (AUC) and Cmax were similar in healthy adult subjects 
and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures 
(AUC) and Cmax are dose-proportional over the therapeutic dose range. Steady-state concentrations of 
filgotinib are achieved in 2 - 3 days with negligible accumulation after once daily administration. 
Steady-state concentrations of GS-829845 are achieved in 4 days with approximately 2-fold 
accumulation after once daily dosing of filgotinib. 
There were no clinically relevant differences in exposures when filgotinib was administered with a 
high-fat or low-fat meal as compared to a fasted state. Filgotinib can be administered with or without 
food. 
Steady-state exposures of filgotinib and GS-829845 are provided in Table 8.

Distribution 
Filgotinib and GS-829845 binding to human plasma proteins is low (55 - 59% and 39 - 44% bound, 
respectively). The blood-to-plasma ratio of filgotinib ranged from 0.85 to 1.1 indicating no preferential 
distribution of filgotinib and GS-829845 into blood cells. Filgotinib and GS-829845 are substrates of 
the P-gp transporter. 
Biotransformation 
Filgotinib is extensively metabolised with approximately 9.4% and 4.5% of an orally administered 
dose recovered as unchanged filgotinib in urine and faeces, respectively. Filgotinib is primarily 
metabolised by CES2, and to a lesser extent by CES1. Both CES2 and CES1 form GS-829845, an 
active circulating metabolite that is approximately 10-fold less potent than the parent compound. In a 
clinical pharmacology study, filgotinib and GS-829845 accounted for the majority of radioactivity 
circulating in plasma (2.9% and 92%, respectively). No other major metabolites were identified. 
As both filgotinib and GS-829845 contribute to efficacy, their exposures were combined into a single 
parameter, AUCeff. AUCeff is the sum of the AUC of filgotinib and GS-829845, corrected for their 
respective molecular weights and potencies. 
Elimination 
Approximately 87% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine as filgotinib and its 
metabolites, while about 15% of the dose was eliminated in the faeces. GS-829845 accounted for 
approximately 54% and 8.9% of dose recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. The mean terminal 
half-lives of filgotinib and GS-829845 were approximately 7 and 19 hours, respectively. 
Other special populations 
Weight, gender, race, and age 
Bodyweight, gender, race, and age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics 
(AUC) of filgotinib or GS-829845. 
Elderly 
There were no clinically relevant differences in mean filgotinib and GS-829845 exposures (AUC and 
Cmax) between older patients aged ≥ 65 years relative to adult patients aged < 65 years. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and GS-829845 were unaffected in subjects with mild renal 
impairment (CrCl 60 to < 90 mL/min). Increases in exposures (AUC) of filgotinib, GS-829845, and 
combined AUCeff (≤ 2-fold), were observed in subjects with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 
< 60 mL/min). In subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min), filgotinib exposure 
(AUC) increased by 2.2-fold and GS-829845 exposure significantly increased by 3.5-fold leading to a 
3-fold increase in AUCeff. The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib has not been studied in subjects with end 
stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min). 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinically relevant changes in the exposures (AUC) of filgotinib and GS-829845 individually, or 
their combined exposure (AUCeff), were observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh B). The pharmacokinetics of filgotinib has not been studied in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

6  As both filgotinib and GS-829845 contribute to efficacy, their exposures were combined into a single parameter, AUCeff. 
AUCeff is the combined AUC of filgotinib and GS-829845, adjusted for their respective molecular weights and potencies. 
Potential for filgotinib to affect other medicinal products 
In vitro data indicate that filgotinib and GS-829845 do not inhibit the activity of the following: 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and 
UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations. The potential for filgotinib to induce CYP2B6 
constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) mediated metabolism in vivo is unknown. No conclusion can 
be drawn from the in vitro data regarding the potential of filgotinib to inhibit or induce CYP1A2. 
In vivo data demonstrated no inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. 
In vitro studies indicate that filgotinib and GS-829845 are not inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, BSEP, 
OAT1, OAT3 or OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology. 
The carcinogenic potential of filgotinib was evaluated in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study and 
a 2-year rat study. Filgotinib was not carcinogenic in mice at up to 150 mg/kg/day, which resulted in 
exposures of approximately 25 and 12 times the exposures in humans at the 100 mg and 200 mg once 
daily doses, respectively. In the 2-year rat study, filgotinib treatment resulted in an increase in 
incidence and decrease in latency of benign Leydig cell tumours at the highest dose of 45 mg/kg/day 
(exposures of approximately 4.2 times exposures in humans at the 200 mg once daily dose); the 
clinical relevance of this finding is low. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Filgotinib was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro 
chromosome aberration assay, and in vivo rat micronucleus assay. 
Adverse findings of degeneration/necrosis of incisor ameloblasts were observed in rats at exposures 
21- to 28-fold greater than clinical exposures at the 200 mg filgotinib dose, with exposure margins at 
the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) ranging from 3.5- to 8-fold. The human relevance of 
these dental findings is considered low since in contrast to adult patients, ameloblasts in rats persist 
into adulthood to support lifelong continuous incisor growth. 
Impaired spermatogenesis and histopathological effects on male reproductive organs (testes and 
epididymis) were observed with filgotinib in rats and dogs. At the NOAELs in dogs (the most 
sensitive species), the exposure margin is 2.7-fold at the 200 mg once daily dose in humans. The 
severity of the histological effects was dose-dependent. Spermatogenic and histopathological effects 
were not fully reversible at exposure margins of approximately 7- to 9-fold the exposure at the 200 mg 
once daily dose in humans. 
Embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated embryolethality and 
teratogenicity at exposures comparable to 200 mg filgotinib once daily dosing in humans. Visceral and 
skeletal malformations and/or variations were observed at all dose levels of filgotinib. 
Filgotinib was administered to pregnant rats at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day. Dose-related 
increases in the incidence of internal hydrocephaly, dilated ureters, and multiple vertebral anomalies 
were seen at all dose levels. At 100 mg/kg/day, an increased number of early and late resorptions were 
noted together with a decreased number of viable foetuses. In addition, foetal body weights were 
decreased. 
In rabbits, filgotinib caused visceral malformations mainly in the lungs and cardiovascular system, at a 
dose level of 60 mg/kg/day. Filgotinib caused skeletal malformations affecting the vertebral column 
region at dose levels of 25 and 60 mg/kg/day, mainly in vertebra, ribs and sternebrae. Fused sternebrae 
also occurred at 10 mg/kg/day filgotinib. Retarded skeletal ossification was evidenced at 
60 mg/kg/day. 
No adverse effects on pre-/postnatal development were observed in rats in a pre- and postnatal 
development study of filgotinib and GS-829845. Filgotinib and GS-829845 were detected in nursing 
rat pups after administration of filgotinib to lactating female rats from gestation day 6 through 10 days 
post-partum at dose levels of 2, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day, likely due to the presence of filgotinib in milk. 
At the highest tested dose, maternal systemic exposure (AUC) to filgotinib in rats was approximately 
2 times the exposure in humans at the 200 mg once daily dose; exposures in nursing pups were less 
than 6% that of maternal exposure on day 10 post-partum. Due to the low exposure of the animals, the 
pre-/postnatal development study was considered inconclusive.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Jyseleca is and what it is used for 
Jyseleca contains the active substance filgotinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus kinase 
inhibitors, which help reduce inflammation. 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Jyseleca is used to treat adults with rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease of the joints. It can 
be used if previous therapy did not work well enough, or was not tolerated. Jyseleca can be used on its 
own, or together with another arthritis medicine, methotrexate. 
Jyseleca reduces inflammation in your body. It helps to reduce pain, tiredness, stiffness and swelling 
in your joints, and it slows down damage to the bone and cartilage in the joints. These effects can help 
you to perform your normal daily activities, and improve your quality of life. 
Ulcerative colitis 
Jyseleca is used to treat adults with ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory disease of the bowel. It can be 
used if you did not respond well enough or did not tolerate previous therapy. It helps to reduce the 
signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis and to reduce your need for steroids. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Jyseleca

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have an infection, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor if you get symptoms 
such as fever, wounds, feeling more tired than usual or dental problems as these can be signs of 
infection. Jyseleca can reduce your body’s ability to fight infections and may make an existing 
infection worse or increase the chance of you getting a new infection. If you have diabetes or 
are aged 65 years or older you may have an increased chance of getting infections. 
if you have ever had tuberculosis (TB), or have come into contact with somebody with TB. 
You may need tests to check for tuberculosis before and during treatment with Jyseleca. 
if you have had a herpes zoster infection (shingles) in the past, Jyseleca can allow it to come 
back. Tell your doctor if you get a painful skin rash with blisters during Jyseleca treatment as 
these can be signs of shingles. 
if you have ever had hepatitis B or C. 
if you have or have had cancer, smoke or have smoked in the past, because your doctor will 
discuss with you if Jyseleca is appropriate for you.

recommend that you have regular skin examinations while taking Jyseleca. If new skin lesions 
appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor.

are not recommended while using Jyseleca. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you start 
Jyseleca. They may want to make sure that you are up to date with your vaccinations. 
if you have, or have had, heart problems, because your doctor will discuss with you if 
Jyseleca is appropriate for you.  
if you have previously had blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or 
lungs (pulmonary embolism) or have an increased risk for developing this (for example: if you 
had a recent major surgery, if you use hormonal contraceptives\hormonal replacement therapy, 
if a coagulation defect is identified in you or your close relatives). Your doctor will discuss with 
you if Jyseleca is appropriate for you. Tell your doctor if you get sudden shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, chest pain or pain in upper back, swelling of the leg or arm, leg pain or 
tenderness, or redness or discoloration in the leg or arm as these can be signs of blood clots in 
the veins.

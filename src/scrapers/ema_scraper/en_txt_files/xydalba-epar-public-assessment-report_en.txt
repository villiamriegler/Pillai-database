2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are among the most common infections in both hospitals and community 
settings, and remain a significant source of morbidity and mortality. These infections can range in severity from 
uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTIs), such as simple folliculitis, to complicated skin and soft 
tissue  infections  (cSSTIs),  including  very  serious  conditions  such  as  necrotizing  fasciitis  and  Fournier's 
gangrene. Complicated skin and soft tissue infections involve deeper soft tissue than uncomplicated infections, 
and may require significant surgical intervention and parenteral antibiotic therapy. Within the hospital or long 
term  care  setting,  cSSTIs  are  generally  a  consequence  of  surgery  or  regarded  as  a  secondary  infection 
associated  with  an  underlying  disease.  Within  the  community,  they  are  most  often  associated  with  the 
consequences of trauma. 
Because of the great variation in seriousness and need of antibiotic treatment other interventions, diagnostic 
criteria and expected time to healing, it has been suggested that treatment of necrotizing fasciitis and burn 
wounds should be studied separately from other skin and soft tissue infections. Abscesses needing immediate 
incision  and  drainage  may  also  be  unsuitable  for  testing  the  effect  of  antibiotic  treatment  as  the  surgical 
procedure may be sufficient alone. 
Systemic risk factors which predispose patients to severe forms of SSTI include diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, 
immune deficiencies, sensory neuropathies, chronic systemic illness, high age and smoking. 
The pivotal studies supporting this application enrolled patients who complied with the definition of the term 
“acute  bacterial  skin  and  skin  structure  infections  (ABSSSI)”,  which  practically  encompasses  patients  with 
cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections and major cutaneous abscesses with a lesion area size of at least 75 cm2 
(possibly lower for areas that involve certain body surface sites, such as the face). The CHMP was of the opinion 
that  the  use  of  this  term  was  more  appropriate  than  cSSTI,  as  it  better  described  the  patient  populations 
enrolled in the clinical trials. The applicant agreed with this conclusion. In this report, the two terms are however 
used interchangeably. 
Studies on the effect of antibiotics need to be well defined with documentation of both local and systemic signs 
of infection. Infections immediately treated with incision and drainage is less suitable for studies and one or 
more signs of systemic infections should be required (European guidelines for clinical evaluation of anti-infective 
drug product 1993, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Stevens DL & al., 2005). 
Furthermore, it is important that the type of infection is well characterized. The validity of the results requires 
also that a significant number of each type of infection is included. 
Although skin and soft tissue infections include a vast array of clinical entities, they are most often caused by two 
single microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.  
In the setting of continuing emergence of resistance among Gram-positive pathogens worldwide, there is an 
increasing medical need for new antibacterial agents with enhanced Gram-positive activity. While S. pyogenes 
remains susceptible to penicillins, the emergence of resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics in S. aureus raises 
a tremendous threat to public health. In recent years methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become a major 
concern, not just with respect to nosocomial infections, but also because a community-acquired (CA) variant has

appeared, unrelated to the hospital acquired strains. Glycopeptides such as vancomycin and teicoplanin are 
often  the  choice  of  drug  for  treating  most  serious  infections  due  to  methicillin-resistant  strains;  however, 
concerns  over  increases  in  the  rates  of  heteroresistance  and  tolerance  to  vancomycin,  combined  with  its 
pharmacodynamic and clinical shortcomings, have motivated the development of newer agents.  
Dalbavancin is a second generation semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic structurally related to teicoplanin. 
Its  mechanism  of  action  involves  the  interruption  of  cell  wall  synthesis  by  binding  to  the  terminal 
D-alanyl-D-alanine  of  the  stem  peptide  in  nascent  cell  wall  peptidoglycan,  thereby  preventing  cross-linking 
(transpeptidation  and  transglycosylation)  of  disaccharide  subunits.  This  disruption  of  the  cell  wall  results  in 
bacterial cell death. Dalbavancin is active against important groups of Gram-positive bacteria, including strains 
of  methicillin  resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA)  and  some  S.  aureus  with  reduced  susceptibility  to 
glycopeptides (GISA). Its potent in vitro activity has been substantiated in various animal models of infection 
and it possesses a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile which allows once-weekly intravenous (IV) dosing. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing dalbavancin 
hydrochloride as active substance equivalent to 500 mg of dalbavancin.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol (E421), lactose monohydrate, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. 
The product is available in single-use 48 ml type I glass vials with an elastomeric stopper and a flip off seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Dalbavancin is a semi-synthetic cyclic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic consisting of a mixture of five closely related 
homologues that can be grouped into two structural families, designated dalbavancin A and dalbavancin B. The 
dalbavancin A familyconsists of two subtypes: dalbavancin A0 and A1. Dalbavancin B, is comprised of three 
subtypes: B0, B1, and B2. 
These homologues share the core structure and all have the same stereochemistry. They differ from one another 
primarily in the length and/or branching of their respective fatty acid side chains on the N-acylaminoglucuronic 
acid moiety (designated as R1) and/or the presence of an additional methyl group (designated as R2) on the 
terminal amino group.  
Dalbavancin drug substance is a hydrochloride salt. 
The structure and chemical IUPAC name of the homologues are:

Dalbavancin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 18 chiral centres. The configuration of the 
asymmetric carbons is controlled by the microorganism in the fermentation process. The core structure of the 
active substance has been elucidated by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV, MS and 1H- 
and 13C NMR) and powder X-ray diffraction.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for dalbavancin. 
The active substance is a white to tan hygroscopic amorphous solid. It is insoluble in acetone; freely soluble in 
water (with higher solubility at pH ≤ 5.5), dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide; practically insoluble in 
chloroform, n-butanol and n-octanol; and soluble in methanol.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Dalbavancin is a semi-synthetic cyclic lipoglycopeptide manufactured by fermentation of a selected strain of 
Nonomuraea species followed by chemical modification. 
The fermentation steps comply with the Ph. Eur. monograph on “Products of fermentation”. The process has 
been described in sufficient detail covering primary and secondary seeds, primary fermentation, microfiltration, 
deacetylation, and purification. The absolute chirality of the intermediate and therefore dalbavancin’s chirality, 
is controlled by the microorganism in the fermentation process.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities have been well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. All impurities observed above the reporting threshold of 0.10% have been 
identified. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), component 
distribution (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), microbial limit (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), chloride content (potentiometry), heavy metals 
(ICP-MS), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 12/103 
  
  
The Guideline on Setting Specifications for Related Impurities in Antibiotics 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/199250/2009) has been followed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on several pilot scale and 6 commercial scale batches of the active substance have been 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 7 commercial-scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in a 
container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 48 months under long term 
conditions at -20°C±5°C, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 5 ºC according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. In addition, stability data from 3 commercial scale batches stored at 25°C/60% RH 
have been submitted. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.  Results from forced 
degradation studies under basic, acid, oxidative and heat conditions were also provide on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, component distribution, related substances, water 
content, pH and microbial limits. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No trends were observed for any of the parameters tested in the batches stored at -20 ºC, and all results 
remained within the proposed specification. A decrease on assay and increase on related substance levels was 
observed at 5 ºC, but all results were within the predefined specifications during 6 months. However, after 6 
months at 5 ºC, and under storage at 25 ºC/60% RH, some parameters were outside of the predefined 
specification.  
The photostability study showed that dalbavancin is susceptible to light, but is adequately protected by the 
primary packaging.  
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a sterile intravenous formulation containing 
dalbavancin hydrochloride as active substance and since the main degradation pathway for dalbavancin involves 
hydrolysis, a solution formulation was not feasible and the development focused on the development of a 
lyophilised dosage form.  
The solubility and stability of dalbavancin at different pH were evaluated in order to determine the optimal pH of 
the formulation. 
During early development, two drug product strengths, 200 mg/vial and 250 mg/vial (varying only in fill 
volume), were used in clinical trials (Phase 1, Phase 2 and the first three Phase 3 studies). As development 
progressed, based upon the therapeutic dosing requirements, formulation development focused on the 
Assessment report

improvement of the dosing convenience (by producing a 500 mg/vial) and the enhancement of the long-term 
stability of the finished product. This 500 mg/vial formulation was utilised for all Durata clinical trials, including 
two pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
The choice of sterilization method was adequately justified.The primary packaging is single-use type I glass vial 
with an elastomeric stopper and a green flip off seal. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and compatibility with the 
formulation has been demonstrated with extraction and leachable studies. 
Dalbavancin finished product requires two preparatory steps prior to administration: reconstitution with sterile 
water for injection to form the reconstituted product, and subsequent dilution with an appropriate diluent prior 
to infusion. A compatibility screening study with different diluents was conducted.  Based on the results of this 
study, 5% glucose is the recommended diluent for this formulation.  This diluted infusion is chemically and 
physically stable at room temperature (20 to 25 °C) and under refrigerated conditions (2 to 8 °C) for at least 48 
hours after reconstitution.  The use of sodium chloride should be avoided as it caused precipitation of 
dalbavancin when used at 9 mg/ml. The finished product is not physically compatible with Lactated Ringer’s 
solution for infusion, and 5% glucose in Lactated Ringer’s solution for infusion. The compatibility of dalbavancin 
with 5% glucose with 0.45% sodium chloride and other intravenous substances, additives, or medications has 
not been established. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: dissolution of dalbavancin and pH adjustment, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated at commercial scale by a number of studies. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form description 
(lyophilised and reconstituted), identification (IR, HPLC), reconstitution time, constituted solution clarity (Ph. 
Eur.), assay (HPLC), drug components (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. 
Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (weight variation) (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.) 
and bacterial endoxotins (Ph. Eur.).  
Batch analysis results from 6 batches manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site confirming 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification 
have been provided. 
The proposed limits for the drug components (homologs A0, A1, B0, B1, and B2) are well in agreement with the 
batch results presented, and can be accepted considering the limited manufacturing experience at the time of 
opinion and the similarity of the different homologs.  However, as these limits are wider than the levels obtained 
in the clinical batches, the applicant is recommended to revise these limits when additional data have been 
generated.

The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 pilot scale and 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for up to 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 
ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Additional supportive stability data from 3 pilot scale batches and stored for 36 months at 5°C, for up to 42 
months at 25°C/60% RH, for up to 18 months at 30°C/65% RH and  for 6 months at 40°C/75% RH  were 
submitted. 
Samples were tested for description (solid and reconstituted solution), constituted solution clarity, assay, 
component distribution, impurities, reconstituted time, pH, water content, particulates, sterility and 
reconstituted stability. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The results from these studies complied with the proposed specifications.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. All results remained within the predefined specification limits. 
An in-use stability testing was performed on batches of dalbavancin finished product after reconstitution with 
water for injection to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml the vials were stored at 5 ºC and 30 ºC / 75 % RH for 48 
hours and tested for assay, degradation products, solution clarity, pH of reconstituted solution and particulate 
contamination. The results indicate that reconstituted dalbavancin powder for solution for infusion is stable 
when stored for 48 hours at 5 °C or 30 °C/75 % RH.  
In addition, dalbavancin finished product was reconstituted with sterile water for injection and further diluted 
with 5 % glucose into infusion bags. Samples were evaluated for appearance, pH, potency/purity at initial (room 
temperature 20 to 25 °C), 24 hours (room temperature) and 48 hours (ambient and refrigerated conditions). 
The diluted infusion was shown to be chemically and physically stable at room temperature (20 to 25 °C) and 
under refrigerated conditions (2 to 8 °C) for at least 48 hours after reconstitution.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give reassurance 
on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant is recommended to revise the limits for the drug components (homologs A0, A1, B0, B1, and B2) 
in the finished product specification once additional batch analysis data have been generated. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies were performed according to Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
For primary Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships please see the clinical part of 
the CHMP AR. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects of dalbavancin may not be expected since dalbavancin specifically inhibits 
bacterial  cell  wall  synthesis  via  interaction  with  the  bacterial  cell  wall  components  and  since  similar 
peptidoglycan  components  are  not  found  in  eukaryotic  cells.  However,  a  broad  in  vitro  screening  of  120 
receptors, ion channels, transporters and enzymes revealed several targets with IC50 values that were below the 
plasma Cmax levels obtained in clinical studies (Cmax =~250-300 µg/mL (165 µM)). Even though plasma levels 
declined rapidly the levels still reached ~55 µM 12 hours and ~10 µM 13 days after a single IV dose of 1000 mg 
infused over 30 min and the clinical 1000/500 mg weekly regimen may give plasma levels higher than 20 µM 
(~40mg/L) for ~14 days. Due to the short t 1/2 alpha phase for dalbavancin, it is agreed that Cavg, and not only 
Cmax,  is  relevant  in  this  context  and  the  estimated  Ki/IC50  levels  are  approximately  ≥2-fold  the  Cavg  for  all 
secondary pharmacological targets identified.

An overview of data on expression, physiological function, and known agonists/antagonists, for the secondary 
pharmacological targets where an IC50 level less than 2-fold the human unbound Cmax for dalbavancin has been 
identified (e.g. the glucocorticoid receptor, caspase-3, ACE, CaMK2alpha, FLT-1, and P38alpha) revealed no 
specific concerns. CaMK2alpha is the target where the lowest IC50/Cavg ratio has been identified (1.9), raising a 
potential cause for concern related to interference within in the CNS in particular. The applicant refers to clinical 
data from 2 patients where dalbavancin levels in the CSF were below LoQ.  Although limited, these data are 
considered useful and reassuring. Furthermore, a review of the Phase 2/3 integrated safety database has not 
revealed any specific drug-drug interactions in dalbavancin-treated subjects, or a safety profile different from 
the comparators. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  CNS  and  autonomic  nervous  system  safety  of  dalbavancin  was  evaluated 
according to guidelines at doses above or equal to the human dose. No effect was seen on the central nervous 
system (Irwin screen and body temperature in mice), autonomic nervous system (cardiac baroreflex function in 
rats) or respiratory function (respiratory parameters in rats) at doses up to 20 mg/kg IV. Plasma exposure at 
these single dose administrations is expected to have been substantially lower than expected human clinical 
exposure. However, based on the available clinical safety data this is not considered to be critical. 
Possible cardiovascular effects of dalbavancin was studied in vitro (no effect on hERG at 16.9 µg/mL, ~equal to 
human fu plasma Cmax level and inconclusive study with rabbit Purkinje fibres) and in several in vivo studies. An 
intermittent non-dose-dependent decline in blood pressure and small increase in heart rate occurred during or 
immediately  after  infusion  of  dalbavancin  at  doses  ≥30  mg/kg  in  dogs.  These  hemodynamic  changes  were 
associated with hives, skin swelling and erythema, indicating a possible involvement of histamine release. Doses 
greater than 30 mg/kg in dogs resulted in Cmax values greater than the ~300 µg/mL observed in clinical trials.

A dose-dependent antiplatelet effect on collagen induced aggregation was seen in vitro in rabbit plasma but no 
statistically significant effect on bleeding time was detected in vivo in rat, suggesting that the detected in vitro 
effect is not likely to be of clinical relevance. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clearance and volume of distribution of dalbavancin scale allometrically by species body weight. Concentrations 
and exposures were dose  proportional within species and long residence times were observed in all species 
investigated.  Volume  of  distribution  was  approximately  0.2  L/kg  (similar  to  the  extracellular  water  volume) 
indicating an interstitial distribution of dalbavancin. 
Dalbavancin was widely distributed throughout the body and was slowly cleared from all of the 40 tested tissues 
and organs in rats administrated 3H-dalbavancin. Concentrations and half-lives of drug-derived radioactivity in 
most tissues of rat were comparable to that observed in plasma over a period of 70 days, suggesting that the 
drug is well-distributed, in equilibrium between tissues and plasma, and do not accumulate substantially in any 
specific tissue/organ. Low but detectable concentrations of drug-derived radioactivity were found in the CNS. It 
may be noted that tissue concentrations in some tissues (e.g. adrenals, spleen and lymph nodes) seemed to 
have a longer half-life compared to plasma. A possible accumulation of dalbavancin in these tissues after repeat 
dose administration can thus not be excluded, which also might be a contributing factor for the histopathological 
changes  seen  in  dogs  in  adrenals,  spleen  and  lymph  nodes  after  prolonged  administration  and  also  after 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015

recovery  (see  repeat  dose  toxicology).  However,  no  such  histopathological  changes  were  reported  for  rat. 
Considering the administration of only two doses to humans, one week apart, possible accumulation and related 
histopathological changes are not likely to be of relevance for the human situation.  
In dogs, dalbavancin clearance from the liver after a single dose in a mass balance study was slower than in rats. 
However, qualitatively the distribution of drug-derived radioactivity within the liver was the same for rats and 
dogs. In rats and minipigs, dalbavancin penetrated the skin with concentrations above pharmacological target 
levels. Plasma protein binding was high and were similar across species (94.16±0.43 in rat; 93.06±1.46 in dog 
and  92.60±1.58  in  human  plasma).  For  both  rats  and  dogs,  the  ratio  of  blood  to  plasma  concentrations  of 
drug-derived radioactivity was constant and <1 throughout 70 and 42 days, respectively. 
Dalbavancin  can  be  characterized  as  a  cationic  amphiphilic  drug,  and  evidence  from  mass  balance  studies 
suggest that it preferentially distributes to tissues with high phospholipid content (e.g., kidney, liver) and in vitro 
incubation  of  a  mouse  macrophage  cell  line  with  14C-dalbavancin  showed  that  most  of  the  cell-associated 
radioactivity was membrane associated rather than cytoplasmic. Based on radiolabeled mass balance studies in 
rats  and  dogs,  dalbavancin  is  relatively  slowly  released  from  these  tissues,  which  may  contribute  to  the 
extensive terminal t 1/2 of the drug. 
Because of dalbavancin's long residence time, estimates of terminal t1/2 across studies were highly dependent 
on assay sensitivity relative to the dosage administered and time elapsed between the dose and last quantifiable 
observation. The predominant t 1/2 values for drug-derived radioactivity were 14 and 24 hours in rats and dogs, 
respectively, as compared to an estimated terminal t 1/2 of ~26 days in both rat and dog and 16 days (range 14 
to 17 days) in humans. 
Dalbavancin was shown to be stable in vitro in incubations with rat, dog, and human liver microsomes, as well 
as in presence of rat, dog, and human hepatocytes. Hydroxydalbavancin (OH-dalbavancin), which was found in 
in  vivo  studies  was  not  observed  in  liver  microsomal  or  hepatocyte  incubates.  Only  low  or  undetectable 
concentrations of OH-dalbavancin and mannosyl aglycone (MAG) were found in plasma, suggesting that the 
metabolite kinetics are formation rate limited, that is, the excretion rate constant is faster than formation rate 
constant. The biotransformation pathways of dalbavancin to its major metabolites, OH-dalbavancin and MAG 
have not been elucidated. It is thus not known if MAG is a “true” metabolite or not. However, based on the higher 
total amount of MAG in excreta as compared to the total amount administered via the batches used in studies in 
dog  and  rat,  MAG  is  concluded  to  be  formed  in  vivo  via  secondary  biotransformation  and/or  chemical 
modification/degradation.  
In rat and dog mass balance studies, radiochemical profiling was performed for urine, faeces, and plasma. All 
peaks in dog urine corresponded to either dalbavancin homologues already present in the drug substance or 
metabolites  (OH-dalbavancin  and  MAG).  Similar  results  were  seen  in  human  and  dog  urine  profiled  by 
LC/MS/MS and radioprofiled rat urine. Metabolites and intact drug are excreted in animal urine and intact drug 
is excreted in animal faeces (only very low levels of metabolites were found in faeces). Metabolite concentrations 
in human plasma were below or close to the limit of quantitation and similar results were observed in animals 
given clinically relevant doses. The presence of metabolites in excreta, especially within the first days after the 
dose,  but  not  in  plasma  suggests  that  metabolites  are  rapidly  eliminated.  Plasma  measures  of 
dalbavancin-equivalent (radioactivity) and dalbavancin in mini-pig were similar, suggesting that radioactivity 
was associated with dalbavancin throughout the 4-week study and that no significant amounts of metabolites 
were  formed,  further  supporting  the  metabolic  stability  of  dalbavancin.  Radiochemical  profiling  was  also 
conducted  on  livers  excised  from  rats  and  dogs  administered  14C-dalbavancin  showed  a  majority  of  the 
radioactivity in the liver of rats associated with intact dalbavancin and no prominent metabolites. 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 18/103 
  
  
Dalbavancin has dual routes of excretion, renal and faecal. In rat, 42%, 26%, and 10% of the drug-derived 
radioactivity was found in urine, faeces, and cage wash, respectively, over 120 days. Corresponding values from 
a dog mass balance study were 63%, 9%, and 5% over 70 days. Both intact dalbavancin and metabolites were 
excreted in these animal studies. In the rat and dog mass balance studies 80% and 90% of the administered 
radioactivity  was  recovered,  respectively.  Dalbavancin  metabolites  were  eliminated  primarily  in  urine. 
Hydroxydalbavancin excreted in urine over 70 days represented ~10% of the dose in rat and ~23% in dog. 
Minor amounts of MAG (~5% of the dose) were also found in urine. In rats, dogs, and humans the only major 
component  found  in  faeces  was  dalbavancin.  MAG  and  OH-dalbavancin  together  accounted  for  only  minor 
amounts (~1%) of the dose in faeces.  In rats, a comparison of drug-derived radioactivity in faeces and in bile 
showed that faecal excretion occurs by both biliary and non-biliary routes. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of dalbavancin was evaluated in standard toxicology studies in mice, rats, dogs, rabbits 
and guinea pigs. Single dose toxicology studies in rats and mice and repeat dose toxicity studies up to 3 months 
in rats and dogs were performed. Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed in rats and 
rabbits and included studies in juvenile rats. Based on the pharmacokinetic data and the similarity in metabolic 
profile between humans, rats and dogs together with the high metabolic stability of dalbavancin in all species 
investigated, the non-clinical species used are considered to be acceptable. Although a human mass balance 
study  has  not  been  performed  a  formation  of  an  unknown  human  specific  metabolite  of  significance  for  the 
toxicological evaluation of dalbavancin is considered to be highly unlikely.  
The proposed dalbavancin clinical dosage regimen is a 1000 mg intravenous (IV) dose on Day 1, followed by a 
500 mg IV dose one week later. In most nonclinical toxicology studies in vivo, dalbavancin was administered 
intravenously.  Because  of  pharmacokinetic  differences  between  animals  and  humans,  daily  dosing  was 
performed in test animals for the duration of the treatment period in order to obtain sufficient exposures. 
Single dose toxicity 
Approximate  LD50-values  after  intravenous  administration  was  approximately  200  mg/kg  for  both  rat  and 
mouse, while the estimated oral lethal dose was greater than 2000 mg/kg in both species.  Adverse clinical signs 
included sedation/hypoactivity, shallow breathing, piloerection and clonic convulsions seen immediately after 
dosing. Recovery of clinical signs was seen within 24 h in surviving animals in mice and after 4-6 days in rats. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In repeat dose toxicology studies (up to 3 months exposure) dalbavancin was shown to induce similar systemic 
toxicity in both rats and dogs with the main target organs being kidneys, liver and the haematological system. 
Local  and  systemic  toxicological  changes  partially  reversed  in  parallel  with  decreasing  plasma  dalbavancin 
concentrations and in proportion to the length of the recovery interval. 
•  Kidney 
Renal toxicity was dose-dependent and evident at ≥20 mg/kg/day in 4-week studies and ≥10 mg/kg/day in 
90-day studies in rats and dogs. Histopathological changes included dilatation, degeneration and necrosis of 
epithelial cells associated with regenerative basophilia, interstitial inflammation, and pigments in histiocytes. 
Increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and findings of blood and epithelial cells in urine were also 
seen. The NOAELs for kidney were 10 mg/kg/day for 28 days of dosing and 5 mg/kg/day for 90 days of dosing. 
Renal  toxicity  was  reversible,  but  residual  renal  fibrosis  (also  referred  to  as  sclerosis)  was  observed  after 
administration of doses higher than 40 mg/kg/day for more than 28 days. “Nephrotoxicity” is included as an 
“Important potential risks” in the RMP. 
• 
Liver 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 19/103 
  
  
Liver toxicity was also dose-dependent and evident at ≥40 mg/kg/day in 4-week studies and ≥10 mg/kg/day in 
90-day  studies  in  rats  and  dogs.  Histopathological  changes  (e.g.  hepatocellular  centrilobular  necrosis)  were 
seen  together  with  clinical  chemistry  changes  (particularly  increased  AST  and  ALT,  but  also  increased 
cholesterol, triglyceride, total bilirubin and GGT or decreases in albumin levels). The NOAELs for liver were 20 
mg/kg/day  for  28  days  of  dosing  and  5  mg/kg/day  for  90  days  of  dosing.  Liver  toxicity  was  reversible,  but 
hepatic fibrosis was observed after administration of 40 mg/kg/day for 90 days in dogs. “Hepatic disorders” is 
included as an “Important potential risks” in the RMP. 
•  Haematological system 
Several  signs  of  haematological  toxicity  were  observed  in  the  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  in  dogs  (more 
pronounced) and rats with reduced RBC, haemoglobin, haematocrit and increased number of platelets in rats or 
decreased in dogs. In the 3-month toxicity study in dogs values for these haematological parameters were still 
affected after 2 month of recovery and did not reverse into baseline until an even more prolonged recovery. 
Haematological  undesirable  effects  (anaemia,  thrombocytosis,  eosinophilia,  leucopenia,  neutropenia)  are 
included as “uncommon adverse reactions” in the SmPC (section 4.8) and haematology effects are included as 
“important potential risks” in the RMP. 
• 
Pigmentation 
In addition, vacuoles and/or dark pigment were observed in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells in a variety of 
tissues (hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelium, mammary gland, pancreatic acinar epithelium, lymph nodes, 
adrenal glands, heart, lung, spleen, and thymus) and in macrophages from several tissues. However, there was 
no  correlation  to  cellular  damage  or  organ  dysfunction  and  the  presence  of  pigment  vacuoles  and/or  dark 
pigment is interpreted as evidence of increased cell membrane turnover and accumulation of lipofuscin and not 
considered  to  be  adverse.  Findings  diminished  in  incidence  but  did  not  completely  reverse  after  recovery. 
Dalbavancin  was  shown  not  to  be  immunotoxic  and  a  potential  effect  on  macrophage  function  is  thus  not 
expected.  The  applicant  concludes  that  these  changes  are  attributed  to  tissue  phospholipidosis  as  a 
consequence  of  the  cationic  amphiphilic  structure  of  dalbavancin  and  its  metabolites.  However,  since  no 
histological analysis has been performed in order to identify phospholipidosis after treatment with dalbavancin 
there are no data to support this conclusion. This lack of data is not considered to be of any concern and no 
further studies are thus needed. 
• 
Pancreas 
The possibility of dalbavancin effect on endocrine pancreas was addressed during the previous submission and 
Glucose Homeostasis has been discussed by the applicant as part of this submission. Nonclinical toxicity studies 
up to 90 days duration in the dog and rat have shown no changes in serum glucose concentrations except in the 
study  on  juvenile  rats  in  which  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  plasma  glucose  was  detected  (20  and  40 
mg/kg/day), although only in male rats.  In the 90-day dog study there were no treatment-related findings of 
the pancreas of either the islets or acini while microscopic findings of vacuolization were observed at all doses (5, 
10, and 40 mg/kg/day) in the 90-day rat study. There were no treatment-related findings in pancreatic islet cells 
in rats at any dose.  
The  vacuolization  of  acinar  pancreas  is  not  considered  to  be  of  relevance  for  a  possible  effect  on  glucose 
homeostasis, as also concluded during the previous assessment. In addition, based on the mild and reversible 
effects  seen  in  the  rat,  the  small  and  variable  differences  in  GI-effects  seen  between  dalbavancin  and 
comparator treated patients in the clinic, and the limited duration of clinical administration of dalbavancin, the 
effects on the acinar pancreas seen in the rat are concluded likely to be of less clinical importance.  
• 
Injection site 
Local injection site toxicity was commonly seen in both rats and dogs characterized by macroscopic skin swelling 
and thickening at the injection site(s) that corresponded to microscopic perivascular inflammation and fibrosis 
and  vascular  degeneration/thrombosis.  It  may  be  attributed  to  local  irritation  related  to  extravasation  of 
dalbavancin. In relation to the infusion, clinical signs of cutaneous swelling and/or erythema, particularly of the 
face and paws were seen in dogs, together with mucosal pallor, salivation, vomiting, sedation, and declines in 
Assessment report

blood  pressure  and  increases  in  heart  rate,  effects  which  may  be  attributed  to  histamine  release. 
“Infusion-related reactions” is included as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
•  Recovery 
Local  and  systemic  toxicologic  changes  partially  reversed  in  parallel  with  decreasing  plasma  dalbavancin 
concentrations and in proportion to the length of the recovery interval. Renal and liver toxicity was reversible, 
but  residual  renal  fibrosis  (also  referred  to  as  sclerosis)  was  observed  after  administration  of  doses  ≥40 
mg/kg/day for ≥28 days and hepatic fibrosis was observed after administration of 40 mg/kg/day for 90 days in 
dogs. 
NOAEL 
The NOAELs for dogs are agreed to be 10 mg/kg/day after 28 days, and 5 mg/kg/day after 90 days of daily 
dosing (1.0 and 0.6 x therapeutic dosing regimen, respectively, based on a 14-day cumulative AUC). Although 
vacuolar degeneration (vacuolization) was seen at all dose levels in rat, also in recovery animals, the applicants 
proposed NOAEL levels in rat (10 mg/kg/day after 28 days, and 5 mg/kg/day after 90 days, equal to 0.7 and 0.6 
x  therapeutic  dosing  regimen,  respectively,  based  on  a  14-day  cumulative  AUC)  is  also  considered  to  be 
acceptable based on the mild effects seen. 
Tissue distribution and toxicity 
The toxicity of dalbavancin correlated with its tissue distribution. Dalbavancin and its metabolites are cationic 
amphiphilic molecules.  Lipophilic amine molecules like dalbavancin distribute into tissues primarily by highly 
favourable and nonsaturating partition and subsequently bind to the phospholipid components of membranes 
and concentrations of dalbavancin in tissue correlate with tissue concentrations of acidic phospholipids (highest 
concentrations  in  kidney  >liver  >lung  >spleen  >thymus).    In  studies  with  radiolabeled  dalbavancin  in  dogs 
about 14% of the dose was recovered in the liver 70 days post dose while only about 0.2% of the dose was 
recovered in the liver at 70 days post dose in a similar study in rat. Dalbavancin thus seem to be present in 
higher  concentrations,  for  longer  periods  of  time,  in  dog  liver  compared  to  rat  liver.  This  higher  hepatic 
concentration in dogs may explain the observation that morphologic hepatic effects were primarily seen in dogs, 
while the predominant effect in rats was transaminase elevations. 
Genotoxicity 
Dalbavancin was evaluated in a battery of genotoxicity assays including a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in 
vitro mammalian cell assays for gene mutation and chromosomal damage and an in vivo mouse micronucleus 
assay. Dalbavancin was concluded not to have any genotoxic potential. 
Exposure levels in vivo and in particular exposure to bone marrow have been discussed by the applicant during 
the  procedure.  CHMP  agreed  that  metabolism  and  formation  of  metabolites  were  expected  to  be  similar  in 
mouse as in other species (despite this was not studied) and that extrapolation of exposure data obtained in 
mice  indicated  that  an  acceptable  exposure  to  dalbavancin  and  its  metabolites  was  achieved  in  the  in  vivo 
micronucleus assay. 
Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted.  This  is  considered  acceptable  based  on  the  short  clinical 
dosage regimen (2 doses separated by 1 week and expected treatment not more than once a year) and based 
on the negative results from the genotoxicity assays performed with dalbavancin. 
Reproduction and Developmental Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development were studied in male and female rats dosed with IV dalbavancin up 
to 45 mg/kg. At this dose level, general toxic effects were observed in males (mortality, clinical signs, reduced 
body weights, body weight gains, food consumption, and nephrotoxicity) and in females (reduced body weight 
gain and food consumption).

In  rats,  the  paternal  and  maternal  NOELs,  as  well  as  NOELs  for  mating  and  fertility  and  embryo  foetal 
development, were 15 mg/kg/day (~1-1.5x therapeutic dosing regimen, based on a 14-day cumulative AUC). 
The NOEL for viability and growth in offspring was 30 mg/kg/day. At 45 mg/kg/day in rats (~3 x therapeutic 
dosing regimen, based on a 14-day cumulative AUC) there was reduced fertility and an increased incidence of 
embryo  lethality,  reductions  in  foetal  weight  and  skeletal  ossification  and  increased  neonatal  mortality.  The 
reduced fertility at 45 mg/kg/day is concluded to be secondary to the renal impairment based on published 
studies in rats  with surgically induced renal impairment and stable uraemia. A similar conclusion  was  made 
during the assessment of the previous submission. 
In  rabbits,  the  maternal  NOEL  was  5  mg/kg/day.  The  highest  dose  tested,  15  mg/kg/day,  was  the 
developmental  NOEL,  but  abortion  occurred  at  this  dose  in  conjunction  with  maternal  toxicity.  The  14-  day 
cumulative AUC in the rabbit developmental and reproduction toxicity study (15 mg/kg/day dose) is estimated 
to  be  approximately  equal  to  the  cumulative  AUC  for  the  therapeutic  dosing  regimen    in  human  (based  on 
extrapolation of the AUC determined in the single dose rabbit PK study). 
No evidence of a teratogenic effect was found.  
In the pre-/postnatal development study reproduction toxicity (reduced pup survival) as well as dystocia and 
prolonged gestation were observed in association with maternal toxicity in the high dose group (30 mg/kg). No 
adverse findings related to dalbavancin were observed in surviving rats of the F1 generation. Dalbavancin was 
found to cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of rats. 
The toxicity profile observed in juvenile rats is consistent with that previously observed in adult rats at the same 
dose levels.  
Local Tolerance 
Dalbavancin  is  considered  to  be  a  non-irritant  for  the  skin  and  eye,  as  well  as  after  intravenous  injection. 
Perivenous injection of dalbavancin gave edema and erythema.  
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Dalbavancin did not have any skin sensitizing capacity in the Guinea-pig maximization test. 
A  decrease  in  humoral  immune  response  and  NK  cell  numbers  were  seen  at  40  mg/kg/day  but  since  no 
functional  effects  on  innate  immunity  or  activity  was  seen,  the  decreases  seen  is  not  considered  clinically 
relevant. In addition no effect on cell mediated immunity was seen. 
The lymphoid depletion or necrosis observed in spleen, lymph nodes and thymus of dogs treated at doses of ≥10 
mg/kg/day for at least 4 weeks were considered secondary to other manifestations of systemic toxicity and are 
not considered to indicate a specific immunotoxic effect of dalbavancin. Similar changes were not observed in 
rats. 
Phototoxicity 
The molar extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption at 284 nm is below 1000 L/M/cm, and dalbavancin 
do not have any significant absorption within the range 290 – 700 nm. The absence of phototoxicity testing is 
therefore considered to be acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dalbavancin  PECSURFACEWATER  value  is  indicated  to  be  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L  and  is  not  a  PBT 
substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Dalbavancin is thus not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 22/103 
  
  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro screening of 120 receptors, ion channels, transporters and enzymes , revealed several targets with IC50 
values that were below the plasma Cmax levels obtained in clinical studies (Cmax =~250-300 µg/mL (165 µM)). 
However, an overview of data on expression, physiological function, and known agonists/antagonists, for the 
secondary  pharmacological  targets  where  an  IC50  level  less  than  2-fold  the  human  unbound  Cmax  for 
dalbavancin revealed no specific concerns. In addition a review of the phase 2/3 integrated safety database has 
not revealed any specific drug-drug interactions in dalbavancin-treated subjects, or a safety profile different 
from the comparators. 
Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on cardiovascular, respiratory, CNS and autonomic nervous systems 
were also concluded not to indicate any effects, except effects on blood pressure and small increase in heart rate 
which were associated with hives, skin swelling and erythema, indicating a possible involvement of histamine 
release. (“Infusion-related reactions” is included as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC.) Plasma exposure at 
single dose administrations used in e.g. studies on respiratory, CNS and autonomic nervous systems is expected 
to have been substantially lower than the expected human clinical exposure. However, based on the available 
clinical safety data this is not considered to be critical. 
Clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  of  dalbavancin  scale  allometrically  by  species  body  weight  and 
concentrations and exposures were dose proportional within species and long residence times were observed in 
all species investigated. Volume of distribution was approximately 0.2 L/kg (similar to the extracellular water 
volume) indicating an interstitial distribution of dalbavancin. Dalbavancin was widely distributed throughout the 
body and was slowly cleared from all of the 40 tested tissues and organs in rats. Tissue concentrations in some 
tissues  (e.g.  adrenals,  spleen  and  lymph  nodes)  seemed  to  have  a  longer  half-life  compared  to  plasma. 
Considering the administration of only two doses to humans, one week apart, possible accumulation and related 
histopathological changes seen in repeat dose toxicology studies are not likely to be of relevance for the human 
situation. Dalbavancin was shown to be stable in vitro in incubations with rat, dog, and human liver microsomes, 
as well as in presence of rat, dog, and human hepatocytes. OH-dalbavancin which was found in in vivo studies 
was not observed in liver microsomal or hepatocyte incubates. The biotransformation pathways of dalbavancin 
to  its  major  metabolites,  OH-dalbavancin  and  MAG  have  not  been  elucidated.  MAG  is  also  an  impurity  and 
present in the drug substance and drug product and it is thus not known if MAG is a “true” metabolite or not. 
However, based on the higher total amount of MAG in excreta as compared to the total amount administered via 
the  batches  used  in  studies  in  dog  and  rat  MAG  is  concluded  to  be  formed  in  vivo  via  secondary 
biotransformation and/or chemical modification/degradation. 
In repeat dose toxicology studies (up to 3 month exposure) dalbavancin was shown to induce similar systemic 
toxicity in both rats and dogs with the main target organs being kidneys, liver and the haematological system. 
“Nephrotoxicity” and “Hepatic disorders” are included as “Important potential risks” in the RMP. Haematological 
undesirable  effects  (anemia,  thrombocytosis,  eosinophilia,  leucopenia,  neutropenia)  are  included  as 
“uncommon adverse reactions” in the SmPC (Section 4.8) and are included as “important identified risks” in the 
RMP.    In  addition,  vacuoles  and/or  dark  pigment  were  observed  in  the  cytoplasm  of  parenchymal  cells  in  a 
variety of tissues, but since there was no correlation to cellular damage or organ dysfunction and the presence 
of pigment vacuoles and/or dark pigment is interpreted as evidence of increased cell membrane turnover and 
accumulation of lipofuscin and not considered to be adverse. The applicant concluded that these changes were 
attributed to tissue phospholipidosis, but no data to support this conclusion were presented. 
Vacuolization and cellular apoptosis were identified in the acinar pancreas of rats and the possible effect on 
endocrine  pancreas  and  glucose  homeostasis  was  addressed  during  the  previous  submission  and  were  also 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 23/103 
  
  
discussed by the applicant. The vacuolization of acinar pancreas was not considered to be of relevance for a 
possible  effect  on  glucose  homeostasis,  as  also  concluded  previously.  In  addition,  based  on  the  mild  and 
reversible effects seen in the rat, the small and variable differences in GI-effects seen between dalbavancin and 
comparator treated patients in the clinic, and the limited duration of clinical administration of dalbavancin the 
effects on the acinar pancreas seen in the rat were concluded to likely be of less clinical importance. Dalbavancin 
is concluded not to be genotoxic based on results from bacterial and mammalian cell assays for gene mutation 
and  chromosomal  damage  and  an  in  vivo  mouse  micronucleus  assay.  No  carcinogenicity  study  has  been 
performed which was considered acceptable by the CHMP based on the short clinical dosage regimen and the 
negative results obtained in the genotoxicity studies performed. 
In the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies a reduced fertility and an increased incidence of embryo 
lethality, reductions in foetal weight and skeletal ossification and increased neonatal mortality were seen. In 
addition abortion occurred at doses inducing maternal toxicity in rabbits. No evidence of a teratogenic effect was 
found in either rats or rabbits. Dalbavancin was found to cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of rats. 
The toxicity profile observed in juvenile rats was consistent with that previously observed in adult rats at the 
same dose levels. The reduced fertility at 45 mg/kg/day was concluded to be secondary to the renal impairment 
based on published studies in rats with surgically induced renal impairment and stable uraemia. 
Local tolerance, immunotoxicity and phototoxicity have also been addressed and no issues have been identified. 
Dalbavancin drug substance and its corresponding drug product contain several impurities which have  been 
toxicologically qualified and/or are specified at acceptable levels. Dalbavancin is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical part of the dossier is considered to be sufficient. No objection or concern was raised by the CHMP 
at the non-clinical level. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The administration of dalbavancin is intravenous. 
Distribution 
As already mentioned, dalbavancin is administered intravenously and its pharmacokinetics was best described 
by a three-compartment model: an initial distributive phase characterized by a t1/2 of ~2.5 h, a beta phase 
accounting for the majority of drug elimination with a t1/2 of ~5 days, and a terminal t ½ of approximately 16 
days  (range  14  days  to  17  days)  (see  below  figure).  The  plasma  protein  binding,  investigated  over  a 
concentration range covering the therapeutic concentrations of dalbavancin, was on average 93% and does not 
differ  between  subjects  with  normal  renal  and  hepatic  function,  and  subjects  with  severe  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment. The protein binding of MAG (a component of the drug substance) and OH-dalbavancin (metabolite 
found in urine and plasma) was determined to 87% and 72%, respectively. These compounds display in vitro

activity, but only OH-dalbavancin has been detected in plasma and at concentrations close to the lower limit of 
quantification. 
Figure  1 
 Mean dalbavancin plasma concentration versus time on a linear scale with sd. 
Table 1 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of dalbavancin in plasma after single iv dose (1000 mg) 
Dalbavancin  single-dose  pharmacokinetics  appeared  to  be  linear  in  the  range  140-1120  mg,  as  were 
maintenance regimens ranging from 300/30 to 1000/100 mg, and there was no indication of time-dependent 
kinetics. 
Metabolism and elimination 
There are no mass balance data for dalbavancin in  human subjects. Following single dosing of dalbavancin, 
~30% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged drug and ~20% of the dose in faeces. Results from two 
renal  impairment  studies  and  from  the  population  pharmacokinetic  (PPK)  analysis  suggested  that  the  CL 
associated with renal function accounts for approximately 30% of the total CL for an individual with a normal 
renal function. 
One  metabolite,  OH-dalbavancin,  was  detected  in  urine  (8-12%  of  the  dose)  and  at  low  levels  in  plasma. 
Mannosyl aglycone (MAG), a component of the drug substance and a degradation product, was also detected in 
small amounts in urine. This compound had a faster clearance into urine than dalbavancin, which suggests that 
MAG is not formed in vivo from dalbavancin. The data presented on faecal recovery, OH-dalbavancin present in 
urine,  and  the  estimated ~30%  contribution  of  non-renal  elimination  to  the  total  CL,  suggest  that  the  liver 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 38/103 
  
  
 
 
 
 
contributes  to  the  elimination  of  dalbavancin.  Dalbavancin  was  metabolically  stable  in  in  vitro  assays 
(hepatocytes, liver and kidney microsomes). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
•  Dose proportionality 
Dose  linearity  was  evaluated  from  pharmacokinetic  data  in  study  VER001-2,  a  phase  1,  randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple dose escalation study designed to assess the safety and 
pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  dalbavancin  administered  intravenously  over  30  minutes  to 
normal, healthy subjects. Fasting was not required and there were no dietary restrictions or requirements.  
Fifty-two subjects were randomized to double-blind treatment with dalbavancin (39) or placebo (13). Fifty-one 
subjects  completed  the  study  and  one  subject  (dalbavancin  multiple-dose)  prematurely  discontinued  at  the 
request  of  the  subject.  In  the  single  dose  evaluation  doses  ranged  from  140  mg  to  1120  mg.  In  the 
multiple-dose phase of the study, dosing consisted of a loading dose (LD), administered as two equal doses 
given 12 hours apart (q12h), followed by a once daily (qd) maintenance dose (MD) and ranged from 300/30mg 
to 1000/100 mg.  
Linear regression analyses were conducted for the individual Cmax and AUC values versus dose. Both analyses 
showed a linear relationship between Cmax/AUC and dose.  
•  Time dependency 
Time  dependency  was  evaluated  in  study  VER001-1,  a  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  single-  and 
multiple-dose, dose escalation study in healthy volunteers. Subjects in the single dose group were administered 
a single dose of dalbavancin via IV infusion at a starting dose of 70 mg on Day 1. Subjects in the multiple-dose 
group received dalbavancin once daily for 7 days via IV infusion at a starting dose of 70 mg. Dose escalation for 
both  single  and  multiple-dose  groups  proceeded  to  140,  220,  360,  560,  and  900  mg  and  all  subjects  were 
observed for 28 days. 
The t 1/2 of dalbavancin following a single dose ranged from 166 to 212 hours. Following multiple IV infusion 
doses of 70 mg dalbavancin once daily for 7 days, significant accumulation occurred. The 24-hour trough values 
following multiple-dose administration of 70 mg showed an approximate 5-fold increase from Day 1 to Day 7, 
6.8 mg/L and 32.5 mg/L, respectively. The mean Cmax value on Day 7 after multiple doses of dalbavancin was 
48.5 mg/L and the mean t 1/2 following the last dose was 194 hours, similar to that observed following single 
doses. The CHMP agreed that there was no indication of time-dependent kinetics. Furthermore, as dalbavancin 
is intended as a two-dose regimen, a time-dependence in kinetics would unlikely be clinically significant. 
Special populations 
The  effect  of  renal  impairment  was  investigated  in  studies  specifically  targeting  a  population  with  renal 
impairment (mild, moderate, severe and ESRD) as well as in the PPK analysis. In subjects with moderate renal 
impairment, there was a 50% increase in dalbavancin AUCinf and the CL was 35% slower compared to subjects 
with normal renal function. AUCinf of dalbavancin increased approximately 2-fold in subjects with severe renal 
impairment, and mean CL was reduced by ~50%. In patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 ml/min), 
the dose of dalbavancin will be reduced. The dosage regimen was based on simulations performed with the PPK 
model, qualified against the data obtained in subjects with renal impairment. The dose adjustment aimed at 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 39/103 
  
  
 
minimizing  the  overall  exposure  of  drug  (AUCinf),  while  maintaining  concentrations  above  the  same  levels 
observed for subjects with normal renal function throughout the 14-day treatment interval. 
Subjects with ESRD receiving haemodialysis had a less marked increase in AUCinf compared to subjects with 
severe renal impairment. It is not fully understood why the plasma exposure to dalbavancin seemed to be less 
affected in these patients. Dalbavancin was not detected in the dialysate samples, but dalbavancin may have 
been present in the dialysate at concentrations below the lower limit of quantification. The increased exposure 
to dalbavancin in subjects with severe renal impairment could also in part be driven by changes in non-renal 
clearance (changes in activity of enzymes and transporters) secondary to accumulation of uremic toxins. This 
effect may be less pronounced in patients with ESRD undergoing haemodialysis, due to the beneficial effects of 
haemodialysis. The conclusion not to dose adjust dalbavancin in subjects who are on regular haemodialysis was 
nevertheless based on a small number of subjects. 
The study in patients with hepatic impairment suggested that patients with a moderate to severe impairment 
had  a  ~30%  lower  exposure  compared  to  healthy  subjects.  The  cause  and  the  clinical  significance  of  the 
decreased exposure in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic function are unknown, which is addressed in 
the Xydalba SmPC. Use of dalbavancin in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is also included 
in the RMP as missing information. 
In  addition  to  the  effect  of  reduced  renal  and  hepatic  function,  a  number  of  covariates  were  identified  as 
statistically  significant,  but  not  clinically  relevant,  predictors  of  dalbavancin  exposure  in  the  population 
pharmacokinetic analysis (gender, age, BSA and albumin). Race was examined as a possible covariate, but did 
not  have  any  statistically  significant  effects  on  the  pharmacokinetic  model  and  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
dalbavancin  seemed  to  be  similar  in  healthy  Japanese  subjects  as  compared  to  North  American/European 
subjects. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  dalbavancin  in  subjects  aged  12  to  16  years  were  investigated  in  a  clinical  study. 
Overall exposure and Cmax appeared to be slightly lower than that observed in adults. Apparent terminal t ½ was 
relatively consistent with what was seen in adults. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Dalbavancin  is  not  metabolised  by  CYP450  enzymes  in  vitro,  therefore  co-administered  P450  inducers  or 
inhibitors are unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin. The CHMP requested the applicant to 
perform  in  vitro  experiments  investigating  dalbavancin  as  a  substrate  of  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  BCRP  and 
P-glycoprotein as post-authorisation measures. 
The interaction potential of dalbavancin on medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes is expected to 
be low since the compound did not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes in vitro. It is not known if dalbavancin is 
an inhibitor of transporters. The CHMP requested the applicant to also address this post-approval. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dalbavancin  is  a  semi-synthetic  glycopeptide  antibiotic,  structurally  related  to  teicoplanin.  Like  other 
glycopeptide antibiotics, dalbavancin interferes with cell wall formation by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine 
(D-ala-D-ala)  terminus  of  the  peptidoglycan,  preventing  cross-linking.  Dalbavancin  is  active  against  most 
relevant groups of Gram-positive bacteria for cSSTI, including strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 40/103 
  
  
aureus (MRSA). Compared with typical glycopeptides, dalbavancin is said to be active against VanB and VanC 
enterococci  and  to  possess  enhanced  activity  against  staphylococci,  particularly  coagulase-negative 
staphylococci (CoNS) and some S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA). 
The  mechanism  of  action  is  bacteria-specific,  and  there  were  no  data  from  the  safety  pharmacology  and 
toxicology studies and clinical trials which indicated any secondary pharmacodynamic effects. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The  in  vitro  antibacterial  activity  of  dalbavancin  was  tested  on  more  than  70.000  clinical  isolates  of 
Gram-positive bacteria worldwide collected from 2007-2012. The activity was also studied in several animal 
models  of  infection.  The  majority  of  isolates  tested  were  staphylococci  and  streptococci.  MIC  ranges  were 
narrow with MIC90 values generally below or at 0.06 mg/L for staphylococci and streptococci.

The susceptibility studies demonstrated that the in vitro potency of dalbavancin was in almost all cases equal to 
or greater than comparators, including vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid.

However, the activity against enterococci are more variable with MIC ranging up to >4 mg/L for vancomycin 
resistant isolates, generally due to the presence of the vanA determinant.  
Data  from  Europe  for  key  pathogens  are  consistent  with  the  US  susceptibility  patterns,  MIC90  values  for 
Gram-positive aerobic cocci do not exceed 0.12 mg/L, except for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 
Table 3 
Dalbavancin Susceptibility of Key Pathogens Collected in European Hospitals from 2006 to 2009.  
Resistance  to  dalbavancin  among  Gram-positive  bacteria  appears  to  be  limited  to  certain  intrinsically 
glycopeptide-resistant species and to bacteria expressing the VanA phenotype. No emergence of resistance to 
dalbavancin was detected in animal infection experiments, or in vitro studies designed to detect development of 
resistance, or in the clinical studies. 
Any  efficacy  benefits  of  dalbavancin  compared  to  the  older  glycopeptides  would  heavily  depend  on  clinical 
activity against isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin. Although higher activity of

dalbavancin based on in vitro data compared to other glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) there seem to 
be a certain degree of cross-resistance within this class.

The  dalbavancin  MIC  range  for  phenotypically  VanA  (teicoplanin-resistant)  enterococci  is  quite  broad,  with 
dalbavancin showing greater activity against some isolates. 
In vivo PK/PD relationship of dalbavancin was investigated using the thigh infection model in neutropenic mice, 
using S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. Dalbavancin produced in vivo bactericidal activity against both bacteria and 
its efficacy was dose-dependent. Data from animal studies and human PK data as well as Phase 2 data indicate 
that dalbavancin should be dosed at less frequent intervals, which was the basis for dosage regimen (once a 
week) in the Phase 3 studies.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
During the procedure, the validation of the bioanalytical methods was discussed and agreed by the CHMP after 
supplementary information provided by the applicant.  
The applicant was requested to perform a  number of post-authorisation measures, aiming at improving the 
understanding of potential drug-drug interactions with dalbavancin. In vitro investigations of dalbavancin as a 
substrate  for  hepatic  uptake  and  efflux  transporters  will  be  performed,  and  the  inhibitory  potency  against 
transport proteins will also be addressed.

Pharmacodynamics 
Clinically relevant glycopeptide resistance occurs in Enterococcus spp. and very rarely in Staphylococcus spp. 
Glycopeptides  do  not  exhibit  complete  cross-resistance,  e.g.  some  vancomcyin-resistant  enterococci  (VRE) 
phenotypes are susceptible to teicoplanin and most teicoplanin-intermediate CoNS susceptible to vancomycin. 
Teicoplanin-resistant  CoNS  have  usually  decreased  susceptibility  to  vancomycin.  According  to  the applicant, 
dalbavancin is active against strains that are susceptible to either teicoplanin or vancomycin, i.e. it is active 
against teicoplanin-susceptible VRE (VanB and VanC phenotypes) and also against teicoplanin-resistant CoNS. 
Teicoplanin-resistant  vanB  enterococci  might  be  expected  to  also  be  resistant  to  dalbavancin.  Additionally, 
dalbavancin  has  in  general  a  somewhat  reduced  susceptibility  against  vancomycin-intermediate  S.  aureus 
(VISA) strains.  
The  maintenance  of  bactericidal  levels  of  dalbavancin  throughout  the  treatment  period  with  proposed 
dalbavancin doses in humans, may contribute to a reduced potential for resistance emergence in pathogens at 
the site of infection. However, considering the slow elimination of dalbavancin and the fact that at least 20% is 
excreted unchanged in faeces, it seems that an ideal situation for emergence and/or selection of glycopeptide 
resistance would be created in the intestinal tract, with extensive periods of sub-inhibitory concentrations. The 
results from studies performed hitherto indicate however that there is possibly low probability of selection for 
glycopeptide resistance. 
The  susceptibility  breakpoints  determined  by  the  EUCAST  are  0.125  mg/L  for  both  staphylococci  and 
streptococci. Based on present clinical data, no pattern of decreased clinical success of decreased pathogen 
eradication associated with high MIC values could be identified. This may be due to the high eradication rate 
overall and the lack of isolates with high MIC values. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacokinetic  program  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  To  further  improve  the 
understanding  of  the interaction  potential  of  dalbavancin,  the  Applicant has  been  requested  to  perform  two 
post-authorisation measures. 
The clinical pharmacodynamic part of the file was considered sufficient by the CHMP. In vitro data, animal data 
and  outcome  of  clinical  studies  imply  that  dalbavancin  exerts  potent  activity  against  the  major  pathogens 
causing ABSSSI. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  dalbavancin  for  the  targeted  treatment  indication  was  evaluated  in  3  phase  3  studies 
(DUR001-301, DUR001-302, and VER001-9). Patients with infections consistent with ABSSSI were eligible for 
enrolment  into  the  3  pivotal  studies.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  study  VER001-9  was  only  to  be 
considered as a supportive study for the current application. Additionally, 3 supportive studies (VER001-16, 
VER001-8, and VER001-5) evaluated the use of dalbavancin in SSTI subjects. 
It should be noted that another marketing authorisation application was submitted in 2007 via the centralised 
procedure  for  dalbavancin  and  contained  study  VER001-9  as  a  single  pivotal  study.  This  application  was 
withdrawn following the CHMP conclusion that the external validity of the study population of this trial was not 
convincingly demonstrated. The applicant now provides data from two new phase 3 studies, DUR001-301 and 
DUR001-302, in addition to the above mentioned study VER001-9 to support the current application.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal dose finding program has been submitted.  The rationale for the dosage regimen chosen (1000 mg on 
day 1 followed by 500 mg on day 8) for studies DUR001-301 and -302 are based on data from neutropenic 
murine thigh infection model, a Monte Carlo simulation on PK/PD data, as well as clinical data from a Phase 2 
study (VER001-05) and the earlier performed Phase 3 study VER001-9 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Design and conduct of main clinical studies 
Each of the pivotal phase 3 studies was randomized, double-blind (third party unblinded), multi-centre study. 
Patients with infections consistent with cSSTI, defined as infections involving deeper soft tissue or requiring 
significant  surgical  intervention,  were  eligible  for  enrolment.  Studies  DUR001-301  and  DUR001-302  have 
similar design and were performed according to current EU guidelines. 
The  inclusion  criteria  for  these  more  recently  performed  studies  were  patients  with  cSSTI  such  as  major 
cutaneous abscess (in total < 30% of this type could be included), surgical site or traumatic wound infection, or 
cellulitis (the total affected area should involve at least 75 cm2 of erythema, except if it involved the central face, 
then the area should be at least 50 cm2),  all characterised in line with existing FDA guidelines; and at least one 
clinical  systemic  sign  of  infection  (elevated  body  temperature  ≥38°C/100.4°F  as  measured  by  the 
patient/caregiver  or  investigator  within  24  hours  of  baseline;  white  blood  cell  count  >12,000  cells/mm3;  a 
manually performed white blood differential count with ≥10% band forms, regardless of peripheral white blood 
cell  count),  as  well  as  infection  severity  such  that  a  minimum  of  3  days  of  IV  therapy  is  appropriate  for 
management of the cSSTI. According to the EMA scientific advice from 2010, the applicant  was advised to aim 
for a considerable proportion of subjects meeting at least 2 SIRS criteria, as well as patients with co-morbidities 
such a diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disorders, concomitant bacteraemia, as these patients are more 
likely to have severe infection.  
Patients with skin infections like superficial/simple cellulitis/erysipelas, impetiginous lesion, furuncle, or simple 
abscess that only required surgical drainage for cure were excluded. This was also the case for patients with 
infections that involved diabetic foot ulceration, a perirectal abscess or a decubitus ulcer. Exclusion of entities 
like diabetic foot infection and infected decubitus ulcer are considered acceptable as these are often associated 
with  Gram-negative  pathogens.  The  exclusion  of  diabetes  foot,  which  would  be  considered  a  complicated 
infection, is also in line with the Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of bacterial infections EMA/CHMP/351889/2013). Diabetes foot infections are advised to be evaluated 
in separate dedicated studies. 
Eligible subjects in studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 were randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with IV 
dalbavancin or IV vancomycin. Dalbavancin was administered as an initial 1000-mg dose, followed by a 500-mg 
dose on day 8. The dose of i.v. vancomycin was 1000 mg or 15 mg/kg (depending on the study site standard of 
care) q12h for 3 days (6 doses) to 14 days. Dosages were adjusted for renal insufficiency. 
Seventy-two  hours  after  study  drug  initiation,  investigators  had  the  option  of  switching  subjects  in  the 
comparator regimen from IV vancomycin to oral linezolid 600 mg administered q12h provided that the criteria 
for  a  switch  to  oral  therapy  were  met  (i.e.,  in  the  previous  24  hours,  the  patient  had  4  temperature 
measurements,  each  separated  by  approximately  6  hours,  in  which  all  4  measurements  were  37.6°C  and 
unequivocal improvement in some or all of the clinical signs of the SSSI under study; if some signs had not 
improved, none should have worsened). The duration of treatment was 10 to 15 calendar days.

Systemic aztreonam could have been administered empirically at randomization for a presumed Gram-negative 
contribution to the cSSTI or to treat a culture-confirmed infection at any time during the study; empirical use of 
aztreonam post randomization was not permitted. Metronidazole (IV. or oral) could be used in both treatment 
groups for suspected anaerobic pathogens and Clostridium difficile infections. 
The applicant has presented separate statistical analysis plans (SAP) for the two pivotal studies DUR001-301 
and DUR001-302, as the US and European regulatory requirements are different regarding the primary efficacy 
endpoints.  In  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  indicated  for 
Treatment of Bacterial Infections (CPMP/EWP/558/95 rev 2), the EMA primary endpoint is the clinical response 
(i.e. success or failure) at the test-of-cure, as assessed by investigators, while the US regulators support an 
early efficacy endpoint at 48-72 hours after initiation of therapy comprised of presence/absence of fever and 
cessation of spread of erythema.  
In the SAP presented to the EU regulators, the primary endpoint was the clinical response (success or failure) in 
the Clinically Evaluable (CE) patient population at the End-of Treatment (EOT) evaluation (study day 14-15). 
Dalbavancin was to be considered non-inferior to the comparator vancomycin/linezolid if the lower margin of the 
confidence interval for the difference in success rates between treatment groups was above 10%. 
It is important to point out that all sample size and power calculations as well as the interim analyses for sample 
size re-calculation were based on the FDA primary endpoint in the ITT population, not the EMA primary endpoint 
in the CE-EOT population.  
It should furthermore be noted that in several EMA guidelines, including the EMA ‘Points to consider on switching 
between superiority and non-inferiority’ (CPMP/EWP/842/99), the choice of analysis sets is described as follows: 
‘In a non-inferiority trial, the full analysis set and the PP analysis set have equal importance and their use should 
lead to similar conclusions for a robust interpretation’. Whether non-inferiority has been proven should therefore 
be judged on both, the primary analysis on the CE-EOT analysis set and the results from the secondary efficacy 
analysis performed on the ITT analysis set. 
CHMP noted that there were numerical differences in the success rates for the EMA primary endpoints at the 
time point of the interim analysis and in the final analysis. The applicant has provided additional clarification on 
these  aspects.  These  were  discussed  by  CHMP,  which  agreed  that  despite  no  clear  explanations  for  the 
differences  have  been  provided,  these  differences  were  not  statistically  significant  and  they  were  therefore 
judged not to affect the overall efficacy conclusions.

Clinical success at EOT in patients randomized prior to and post interim analysis (CE-EOT and 
Differences  were  also  noted  between  the  study  protocols  of  the  two  pivotal  studies  DUR001-301  and 
DUR001-302 regarding the criteria for inclusion into the CE-EOT populations. The applicant explained that these 
were needed based on the experience from the DUR001-301 study. CHMP agreed that the number of excluded 
patients by applying these criteria was small and was not considered to have significantly impacted the overall 
study results.  
Study populations 
In the 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy of dalbavancin in cSSTI, the following main patient populations 
were identified for the efficacy analyses, as follows: 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population:  
•  Studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302: All randomized patients regardless of whether or not they 
received study drug. 
•  Study VER001-9: All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
Safety Population (for studies DUR001-301 and 302):  
•  All patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of dalbavancin or active comparator study 
drug. For Study VER001-9, the safety population was the same as the ITT population. 
Microbiological Intent-to-treat (MicroITT) Population:  
•  All patients in the ITT population with at least 1 Gram-positive pathogen identified at baseline. 
Clinically Evaluable (CE) Population:  
• 
Patients with a cSSTI at baseline who did not violate the protocol in such a way that precluded clinical 
evaluability, according to specific protocol violation definitions. A CE population was identified for each 
visit, ie, end-of-therapy (EOT) visit and short-term follow-up (SFU) visit or test of cure (TOC; VER001-9 
visit; 14 ± 2 days after completion of therapy); TOC in Studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 was 
equivalent to the EOT visit on Day 14. 
Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) Population:  
•  Met all the criteria for the CE population and had a Gram-positive causative pathogen at baseline. An ME 
population was identified for each visit (EOT, SFU, TOC). 
The CE population was the primary population for the analysis of clinical status at EOT. However according to the 
Guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial  infections, 
CPMP/EWP/558/95 rev 2, the CE and all treated populations should be viewed as co-primary, i.e. consistency in 
outcome between the CE and the ITT populations is considered crucial.

Clinical endpoints 
Studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 
Endpoints for assessment of clinical response were: 
- 
Early clinical response (defined as cessation of spread and absence of fever) at 48-72 hours post-study 
drug initiation in the ITT population 
End-of-treatment (EOT) visit (Day 14-15) in the CE-EOT population.  
- 
-  Short-term follow-up (SFU) visit (Day 28 ±2 days) in the CE-SFU population. 
- 
Long-term follow-up (LFU) visit; targeted for Day 70, but the visit could have occurred from Day 60 
through Day 88, in the CE-LFU population. 
Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable measure in Studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 was clinical status at the EOT 
in the clinical evaluable (CE) population. A patient was defined as a clinical success based on the following:  
−  The patient’s lesion size, as defined by erythema, had decreased from baseline;  
−  The patient’s temperature was ≤37.6o C (by any measurement method).  
− 
− 
− 
Local signs of fluctuance and localized heat/warmth were absent; 
Local signs of tenderness to palpation and swelling/induration were no worse than mild; and  
For patients with a wound infection, the severity of purulent drainage was improved and no worse than 
mild relative to baseline.  
−  No need for further systemic antibacterial treatment for the SSTI. 
In Study VER001-9, the primary efficacy variable was the clinical response (success, indeterminate, or failure, 
as assessed by investigator) in the CE population at TOC (Day 28).  
−  Clinical success was defined as sufficient resolution of the local and systemic signs and symptoms of 
SSTI such that the patient did not receive new systemic antibacterial treatment for SSTI. 
Regarding the timing of the assessment of the primary endpoint in the studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302, 
this  was  discussed  in  the  previously  mentioned  CHMP  scientific  advice  (2010).  Although  usually  the 
recommended time point for studies in cSSTI/ABSSSI is 7-10 days after the last day of treatment (Addendum to 
the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial  infections, 
EMA/CHMP/351889/2013), it was agreed that the exceptionally slow elimination of dalbavancin may lead to 
unbalances between the treatment arms regarding active substance in the body at this time point. CHMP agreed 
in the above mentioned scientific advice that the primary efficacy variable should be evaluated at EOT. However, 
consistency between the outcome collected at EOT (=TOC) and at short-term follow-up (SFU) (day 28) in the 
different patient populations was considered essential. In general, the primary and secondary efficacy variables 
are endorsed and in line with current EU guidance, emphasising sufficient resolution of local and systemic signs 
and symptoms, such that the patient did not need any further systemic antibacterial treatment for the skin and 
skin structure infections. 
Efficacy data and additional analysis 
Demographic characteristics 
The  demographic  characteristics  were  evenly  distributed  between  the  two  treatment  groups  in  both  of  the 
studies and also across the studies. The majority of the patients were males, whites, had creatinine clearance 
≥ 30 mL/min, an elevated mean BMI and fever at baseline. 
The number of patients hospitalised at study entry was:

DUR001-301: Dalbavancin group: 173 patients (75.2%) vs. vancomycin/linezolid group: 177 patients 
(75.0%). 
DUR001-302: Dalbavancin group: 242 patients (70.1%) vs. vancomycin/linezolid group: 249 patients 
(71.8%). 
Disease characteristics 
Local signs of infection at baseline 
DUR001-301: in the ITT population, local signs of infection at baseline were similar between the two treatment 
groups (table below). 
Table 6

DUR001-302: 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015

Overall,  in  the  ITT  population,  local  signs  of  infection  at  baseline  were  generally  similar  between  the  two 
treatment groups. 
Table   7 
DUR001-302 – Local signs of infection at baseline (ITT and CE-EOT populations) 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  in  study  DUR001-301  had  absence  of  purulent 
drainage/discharge and fluctuance. The signs of erythema, heat/localised warmth, tenderness to palpitation and 
swelling/induration were all classified as severe in most subjects. 
For DUR001-302 the results were quite similar, except that compared to DUR001-301 the percentage of patients 
classified as moderate did not differ from the percentage categorised as severe for erythema, heat/localised 
warmth and swelling/induration. It therefore seems that the local signs of infection might be of lesser severity 
in this study compared to the observations made in DUR001-301.

Table   9 
DUR001-302 - Systemic signs of infection at study entry (ITT and CE-EOT populations) 
For both studies DUR001-301 and 302 the results show that almost all patients had 1 of the systemic signs in 
both treatment groups. Around 30-40% had 2 signs and app. 10% had 3 signs in both treatment groups in 
DUR001-301. For DUR001-302 the corresponding numbers were app. 30% and around 5-6%, respectively. In 
study DUR001-301 around 60% met the SIRS criteria (both treatment groups) while this was the case for ca. 
40%  in  DUR001-302.  When  looking  at  the  infection  type  cellulitis,  major  abscess  and  wound  infection  the 
majority of patients fulfilled the temperature criterion in both treatment groups for both studies. Across infection 
types  patients  with  major  abscess  were  least  likely  to  fulfil  this  criterion  in  both  treatment  groups  in  both 
studies.  
Low  numbers  of  patients had  all  3  signs  of  systemic  infection  and  this  was  similar  between  infection  types, 
treatment groups and studies. 
In order to ensure that the included infections could be defined as complicated, not only the size of the lesion 
area  is  of  importance,  also  the  depth  of  the  soft  tissue  involvement  (subcutaneous  tissue,  fascia  plane  and 
muscle) is a critical parameter. The applicant has clarified that the depth of the infections was assessed only in 
a minority of the included patients. It was also noted that no requirement to provide specific information on this 
is mentioned in the CHMP guideline on antibacterials. 
Outcome 
In  studies  DUR001-301  and  DUR001-302,  approximately  90%  of  subjects  within  each  treatment  group 
completed the study and the percentages of subjects either discontinuing from the study or withdrew from study 
drug were relatively well balanced across treatment groups within each study. In study VER001-9, there were 
however  some  imbalances  regarding  subjects  who  were  withdrawn  due  to  worsening  of  clinical  status, 
disfavouring the dalbavancin group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015

When  assessing  data  from  a  clinical  phase  3  study,  the  issue  whether  the  external  validity  of  the  study  is 
acceptable, i. e. that a sufficient number of patients with representative disease entities and severe disease 
requiring IV therapy was included and is accessible for evaluation, is crucial. 
CHMP noted that a considerably higher proportion of patients in studies DUR001-301 and -302 were recruited in 
Europe (close to 60%) compared to the first Phase 3 study, VER001-9 (approximately 15%). 
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects in each population by pivotal study is shown below:

The reasons for exclusion from the clinically evaluable populations in studies DUR001-301 and -302 were similar 
in  all  treatment  groups.  In  study  VER001-9,  there  was  higher  proportion  of  patients  excluded  from  the  CE

population in the dalbavancin group leading to indeterminate response, and of patients who received <72 hours 
of study drug (6.3% vs. 1.4% at TOC). Besides any potential effect on the outcome of the primary endpoint 
caused by this imbalance, this also indicates that many of the patients were not severally ill enough at baseline, 
since they required less than 3 days IV therapy. 
Study drug exposure 
Due to the short half-life of dalbavancin, each dose of dalbavancin was assigned a duration of 7 days’ worth of 
treatment in  the  phase  3 program.  Subjects  receiving  dalbavancin  were  more  likely  than  subjects  receiving 
vancomycin/linezolid to receive a shorter duration of blinded treatment (i.e., including placebo), with a greater 
proportion of dalbavancin subjects than vancomycin/linezolid subjects receiving 10 days of treatment (20.8% 
vs.  15.3%).  Of  those  subjects  completing  10  to  14  days  of  therapy,  fewer  dalbavancin  than 
vancomycin/linezolid subjects received more than 10 days of therapy (27.2% vs. 34.3%). 
The pooled data from the DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 studies showed that 1260 (96.6%) of patients received 
≥  72 hours of intravenous study drug therapy.  
Characteristics of patient populations 
In the phase 3 studies DUR001-301 and -302 the most common category of infection was cellulitis (52% to 
55%) in contrast to study VER001-9 where little less than 30% were categorized as cellulitis. In that study there 
was a category of deep soft tissue infection (approximately 16%). Major cutaneous abscess constituted 24% to 
30% in the two more recent studies, similar as in the older study (major abscess approximately 30%), which is 
in  line  with  current  CHMP  guidance  (Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products 
indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial  infections,  EMA/CHMP/351889/2013)  which  recommends  that  the 
proportion of patients enrolled with abscess should be limited to approximately 30%. Further, the Addendum 
requires  that  patients  should  demonstrate  a  protocol-defined  minimum  number  of  signs  and  symptoms 
associated  with  an  ongoing  acute  infectious  process;  this  criterion  was  generally  fulfilled  for  the  patients 
included  in  these  two,  more  recently  performed  studies.  See  further  discussion  on  outcome  based  on  the 
presence of systemic signs of infection and SIRS criteria. 
The number of patients with Gram-positive bacteraemia was low in both treatment groups in each of the two 
pivotal  studies.  In  DUR001-301  a  total  of  8  cases  in  the  dalbavancin  group  vs.  6  cases  in  the 
vancomycin/linezolid  group  were  observed.  The  corresponding  numbers  for  DUR001-302  were  a  total  of  21 
cases in the dalbavancin group compared to 11 in the vancomycin/linezolid group. In study VER001-9 there 
were 12 bacteraemic cases in the dalbavancin group and 6 patients in the comparator group. 
In study DUR001-301 around 15% in the dalbavancin group vs. ca. 10% in the vancomycin/linezolid group had 
an  established  diagnosis  of  diabetes  mellitus.  In  DUR001-302  there  were  fewer  patients  in  the  dalbavancin 
group with this diagnosis (around 10% vs. ca. 17% in the comparator group).  
In both studies the number of patients with peripheral arterial disease was also scarce (1%).  
In study VER001-9, 23% of the overall population had diabetes, and vascular disease was present in 9% of the 
overall  VER001-9  population.  These  figures  are  higher  than  for  studies  DUR001-301  and  DUR001-302. 
Nevertheless,  the  inclusion  criteria  did  not  specifically  require  adequate  systemic  signs  of  infection,  and  no 
detailed  data  for  e.g.  SIRS  were  presented,  which  led  the  CHMP  to  question  at  the  time  of  the  previous 
marketing authorisation the adequacy of the included patients in terms of severity in the former MAA procedure. 
This  is  the  reason  why  the  results  of  this  study  could  only  be  considered  as  supportive  for  this  marketing 
authorisation application. 
Distribution of pathogens 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 54/103 
  
  
The most commonly isolated pathogen in the three pivotal studies was Staphylococcus aureus, of which MRSA 
ranged from 65 to 81%, followed by Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition other isolated pathogens belonging to 
various species, were judged as pathogens and associated with the skin and skin structure infections by the 
applicant. This is generally consistent with what is expected from this target population. Of note, the number of 
S. pyogenes was unexpectedly low in particular in study DUR001-301 and VER-001-9. During the procedure, the 
CHMP asked the applicant to discuss this rather low number of S. pyogenes and it was accepted and supported 
by external evidence that a lower yield of S. pyogenes can be expected in the cultures. The serological data 
confirmed that dalbavanicn was effective in these cases. The distribution of the pathogens isolated from the 
primary site of infection at baseline was similar in both treatment groups.

The  CHMP  advised  the  company  in  the  scientific  advice  given  to  focus  the  recruitment  in  areas  with  high 
prevalence of MRSA. Despite the fact that this recommendation seems to have been fulfilled as in several of the 
listed countries the probability of finding patients with infections caused by MRSA is expected to be rather high, 
the final results showed a relatively low frequency of MRSA in both pivotal trials (< 30%). Nevertheless, CHMP 
agreed that the frequency of MRSA was not lower than what had been accepted earlier from similar marketing 
authorisation applications for approved in the same indication. 
The patients in the two studies had mainly monomicrobial infections. However, in DUR001-301 this comprised 
more patients in the dalbavancin group (87.6%) compared to the comparator group (77.4%) and also when 
compared to both treatment groups in study DUR001-302 (dalbavancin group 71.2% of patients and in the 
vancomycin/linezolid group 71.3% of patients). This could potentially favour the result of the dalbavancin arm 
in DUR001-301.

Microbiological response by pathogen 
By-pathogen microbiological response at EOT in the ME population is summarized for each phase 3 study below 
for Gram-positive aerobes (including S. aureus, MRSA, MSSA) and Gram-positive anaerobes. The by-pathogen 
microbial response provides additional important data, indicating non-inferiority to the comparator in important 
species, as supported by in vitro microbiology data.

There  was  no  indication  on  differences  in  clinical  outcome  between  treatment  groups  in  respect  of  baseline 
demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race or ethnicity.  
Lower success rates were seen in countries outside North America and the European Union, specifically in some 
countries from Asia and South Africa, though the number of patients in those countries was small.

Short-term follow-up (SFU) and long-term follow-up (LFU) visits 
The  proportion  of  patients  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  a  clinical  success  at  EOT  or  SFU  in  any  of  the 
populations analyzed were similar between the two treatment groups for both studies. 
Very few patients were deemed as relapse/recurrence at the LFU visit; in DUR001-301 one patient from the 
vancomycin/linezolid  was  considered  a  relapse/recurrence  while  in  DUR001-302  one  patient  from  the 
dalbavancin group was considered the same.  
Based on these results it seems that for the remaining patients that were clinical successes at SFU the effect 
persists also until LFU for both dalbavancin and vancomycin/linezolid in both pivotal studies. 
The applicant stated that at the LFU assessment serum levels of dalbavancin would be approximately 3 mg/L. 
Considering  that  MIC90s  of  0.06  mg/L  for  staphylococci  and  0.03  –  0.06  mg/L  for  streptococci  have  been 
observed for dalbavancin, this implies that at the time point for LFU, therapeutic levels of dalbavancin are still 
present in the body. The potential for relapses when therapeutic levels of dalbavancin are no longer present was 
therefore not studied. However, this is not considered necessary because the slow elimination of dalbavancin 
would likely decrease the risk for relapses. Furthermore, the timing of the evaluation has been agreed by the 
CHMP in previous scientific advice.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no clinical efficacy studies in special populations.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
In two of the three pivotal studies (DUR001-301 and VER001-9), the point estimates for the primary endpoint 
were  numerically  lower  in  the  dalbavancin  arms,  whereas  in  study  DUR001-302  the  point  estimate  for  the 
primary endpoint was higher in the dalbavancin arm as opposed to the comparator arm. In all studies, the lower 
value of the 95% CI was within the predefined range.

Supportive studies 
There  were  three  supportive  studies  (VER001-16,  VER001-8  and  VER001-5)  which  were  conducted  in  the 
indication complicated or uncomplicated SSTI. All these studies were assessed during the former MAA procedure 
in 2007-2008. Apart from study VER001-8, which was a phase 3 study performed in patients with uncomplicated 
SSTIs,  the  other  two  studies  were  smaller  phase  2  studies,  partly  including  subjects  with  cSSTIs.  Similar 
concerns to those expressed for the pivotal study VER001-9 with regard to the patients included with cSSTI were 
also expressed for these two studies. , namely that the external validity of the studied populations was not clear 
since the severity of the cSSTIs was uncertain, and that it was questionable whether the patients were really in 
need of IV antibiotic therapy. CHMP agreed nevertheless that although the clinical and microbiological outcome 
data from these supportive studies are in line with that of the pivotal studies, the supportive studies did not have 
a major impact on the assessment of efficacy of dalbavancin for the applied indication.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The rationale for the dosage regimen chosen (1000 mg on day 1 followed by 500 mg on day 8) for studies 
DUR001-301  and  -302  was  based  on  data  from  a  neutropenic  murine  thigh  infection  model,  a  Monte  Carlo 
simulation  on  PK/PD  data,  as  well  as  clinical  data  from  a  phase  2  study  (VER001-05)  and  from  the  earlier 
performed  phase  3  study  VER001-9.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  chosen  dose  regimen  can  be  considered 
reasonable. 
Both  studies  DUR001-301  and  DUR001-302  were  phase  3,  randomised,  double-blind,  multicentre, 
double-dummy studies aiming to demonstrate non-inferior efficacy and to compare the safety of dalbavancin to 
a  comparator  regimen  (vancomycin  with  the  option  to  switch  to  oral  linezolid)  for  the  treatment  of  acute 
bacterial skin and skin structure infections known or suspected to be caused by Gram-positive bacteria. In these 
studies, patients with cSSTI such as major cutaneous abscess, surgical site or traumatic wound infection, or 
cellulitis, and at least one clinical systemic sign of infection, were included, in accordance with the definition of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive in a 1:1 ratio either two IV doses of dalbavancin (one on Day 1 and 
one on Day 8) or 10 to 14 days of IV vancomycin/oral linezolid. A total of 20 to 28 doses of vancomycin/linezolid, 
either active or placebo depending on randomization group, were to be administered. Following at least 72 hours 
of study drug treatment, patients could have been switched from q12h IV study drug (either dalbavancin and 
placebo or vancomycin and placebo) to oral therapy for patients in the vancomycin/linezolid treatment group or 
matching placebo for patients in the dalbavancin treatment group if clinical signs of infection had improved. 
The applicant received CHMP Scientific Advice regarding the inclusion criteria of the pivotal studies. To reduce 
the  risk  of  including  non-severe  infections,  CHMP  recommended  that  a  considerable  proportion  of  subjects 
should meet at least 2 SIRS criteria and that patients should be considered to require a period of 7 days of IV 
therapy. In addition, CHMP advised the company to include a sufficient number of patients with co-morbidities 
such as diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disorders, concomitant bacteraemia, and that the number of signs 
of systemic infection required for enrolment should be increased. The applicant, however, decided to include 
patients based on at least one sign of systemic infection and a minimum of 3 days of IV therapy for both studies. 
It has been clarified that a sufficiently large portion of the patients included in the pivotal studies had severe 
infections. 
The applicant envisaged that dalbavancin would be primarily used in the treatment of MRSA. In accordance with 
the scientific advice received, the studies were therefore performed in regions where a high prevalence of MRSA 
would  be  expected.  Despite  this,  less  than  30%  of  the  patients  in  the  pivotal  studies  were  diagnosed  with 
infections caused by MRSA. Nevertheless, the CHMP agreed that the frequency of MRSA was not lower than what 
had been accepted earlier in similar marketing authorisation applications of medicinal products for the same 
indication. 
Vancomycin is a suitable comparator for cSSTI due to MRSA but not considered as effective in treating cSSTI due 
to MSSA or streptococci. In those cases where cSSTI is caused by MSSA semisynthetic penicillins would be a 
more  appropriate  choice.  Therefore  vancomycin/linezolid  might  not  be  an  ideal  comparator  in  this  setting 
considering  the  rather  low  number  of  MRSA  infected  patients  included  in  the  pivotal  studies.  CHMP  agreed 
however that the chosen comparator could be considered acceptable since the pivotal studies were performed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 69/103 
  
  
 
areas with an expected high prevalence of MRSA. Furthermore, the high response rates in the control arm are 
noted. 
The primary objective for the analysis to be presented to the CHMP was to show non-inferiority in the rate of 
clinical success at EOT of dalbavancin compared to the comparator regimen vancomycin/linezolid. This strategy 
of  aiming  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  towards  an  appropriate  reference  regimen  is  in  line  with  the 
recommendations of the CHMP guideline and was considered acceptable. 
The primary outcome of the pivotal trials was the clinical status (success or failure) in the CE-EOT population at 
the  EOT  Visit  (study  day  14-15).  The  criteria  for  clinical  success  (decrease  in  erythema,  temperature, 
tenderness, swelling/induration and purulent drainage) were in line with what had been accepted for similar 
applications. According to the CHMP guideline, clinical response (i.e. success or failure) at Test of Cure (TOC) 
should be the primary efficacy endpoint. In this application, the TOC visit corresponds to the End of Treatment 
(EOT) visit, i.e. at study day 14-15. Considering the long terminal half-life (approx. 16 days) of dalbavancin the 
timing of EOT is not considered optimal, since therapeutic levels of dalbavancin would still be present in the 
blood at EOT. However, this timing was agreed upon in the CHMP Scientific Advice, but it was considered that  
the consistency in outcome of the additional endpoint, clinical success at short-term follow-up (SFU) visit (day 
28 +/-2 days) would be crucial. Therapeutic levels of dalbavancin would also be present at the SFU visit (Day 28) 
and even at the long-term follow-up (LFU) visit (Day 70). This is based on information by the applicant that 
serum levels of dalbavancin would be approximately 3 mg/L at the LFU assessment. In addition, MIC90s of 0.06 
mg/L  for  staphylococci  and  0.03  –  0.06  mg/L  for  streptococci  have  been  observed  for  dalbavancin,  further 
confirming  that  therapeutic  levels  of  dalbavancin  would  still  be  present  in  the  body  at  LFU.  Despite  some 
concerns that patients receiving dalbavancin might risk relapsing at a later time point, the CHMP overall agreed 
that this risk seemed remote and it was therefore considered that it would not have a significant impact for the 
assessment. The applicant has presented two separate statistical analysis plans (SAP) for the two pivotal studies 
DUR001-301 and DUR001-302; one for the FDA and one for the EMA (clinical success at 48-72 hours and at test 
of  cure,  respectively).  Different  statistical  analyses were  needed because  the  two  agencies  require  different 
primary  efficacy  endpoints.  This  approach  is  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of 
Medicinal Products indicated for Treatment of Bacterial Infections (CPMP/EWP/558/95 rev 2) and the Addendum 
to this guideline (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013).  
The non-inferiority margin of -10% for studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 was considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The majority of the enrolled patients in the two pivotal studies were males, whites, had creatinine clearance ≥  
30 mL/min, an elevated BMI and fever at baseline. The proportion of patients hospitalised at study entry was 
around 70%. 
In both studies the most common type of infection was cellulitis (approximately 50-60%) and major cutaneous 
abscess (< 30%). Few subjects with surgical site infections were included. The mean values for the erythema 
areas affected were well above 75 cm2 for all infection types in the ITT population in both treatment groups in 
both studies. In order to ensure that the included infections could be defined as complicated, not only the size 
of  the  lesion  area  is  of  importance,  also  the  depth  of  the  soft  tissue  involvement  is  a  critical  parameter. 
Regarding the local signs of infection, these were classified as severe in the majority of patients in DUR001-301. 
In DUR001-302 the percentage of patients with moderate signs of local infection were similar to the percentage 
with severe local signs. It therefore seems that the local signs of infection might be of lesser severity in this 
study compared to the patients in DUR001-301.  
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 70/103 
  
  
For both studies the results show that almost all patients had one systemic sign of infection (fever, WBC > 
12,000  cells/mm3  or  bands  >  10%)  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  DUR001-301  around  60%  met  the  SIRS 
criteria (both treatment groups) while this was the case for approx. 40% in DUR001-302. The proportion of 
patients classified as having a severe infection is in line or exceeds that agreed by CHMP in other recent studies 
used for the approval of medicinal products for cSSTI.  
A  high  rate  of  success  was  observed  in  both  treatment  arms  in  DUR001-301,  i.e.  87.0%  of  patients  in  the 
dalbavancin arm versus 91.4% of patients in the vancomycin/linezolid arm. Compared to study DUR001-301 an 
even  higher  success  rate  was  found  in  DUR001-302,  i.e.  clinical  success  was  93.5%  and  92.7%  in  the 
dalbavancin  arm  and  vancomycin/linezolid  arm,  respectively.  Non-inferiority  of  dalbavancin  compared  to 
vancomycin/linezolid for the primary end point clinical success at EOT in the CE population was demonstrated in 
studies DUR001-301 and DUR001-302. The lower limit of the 95% CI was within -10%, although a tendency to 
lower success rate was noticed in study 301. The outcome in the ITT population was well in line of that of the CE 
population. 
The majority of patients had IV treatment for 72 hours or longer.  
The  most  commonly  isolated  pathogen  in  the  three  pivotal  studies  was  Staphylococcus  aureus,  of  which  a 
various part consisted of MRSA (range 65-81%), followed by Streptococcus pyogenes. Notably, the number of 
S. pyogenes was low in particular in study DUR001-301 and VER-001-9. A rather low proportion of cultures 
positive for Streptococcus pyogenes can be expected in cSSTI. The frequency of MRSA was relatively low, but 
this  was  deemed  to  be  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  patients  in  the  two  studies  had  mainly  monomicrobial 
infections. However, in DUR001-301 more patients in the dalbavancin group had monomicrobial infections when 
compared both to the vancomycin/linezolid group and to each of the two treatment groups in DUR001-302. This 
could potentially favour the result of the dalbavancin arm in DUR001-301. 
Clinical  success  rates  in  patients  with  S.  aureus  (regardless  of  methicillin  resistance)  and  streptococcal 
ABSSSIwere  approximately  90%  in  both  treatment  groups,  which  is  considered  in  line  with  the  expected 
outcome as per previously conducted cSSTI studies.  
Clinical success rates at EOT were similar in the dalbavancin and vancomycin/linezolid groups for all infection 
types. The numerically highest response rate was generally demonstrated for major abscesses, regardless of 
treatment. There were some imbalances within each of the two studies regarding clinical success rates in the CE- 
population in patients who met SIRS criteria, at SFU, but looking at the pooled data, the outcome was deemed 
reassuring.  
In study VER001-9, the outcome for the primary endpoint (clinical cure at TOC) demonstrated non-inferiority to 
linezolid, with a treatment difference of -2.2% (95% CI -7.28, 2.86). Due to an imbalance of indeterminate 
response in the ITT population, the study was also analysed when indeterminate response were excluded, as a 
post-hoc analysis, and the observed treatment difference was -2.20 (95% CI -6.7, 2.3). Nevertheless., the fact 
that excluding all indeterminates gave results which were more similar to the CE population was not unexpected. 
Median time to switch to oral therapy was 2 days, which seems to be a relatively short time, further indicating 
that a substantial part of the patients were not seriously ill. 
In general, the analyses of the secondary outcomes for DUR001-301 and DUR001-302, i.e., clinical success at 
EOT in the ITT population, clinical success at SFU in the ITT and CE-SFU populations, microbiological success at 
EOT, eradication rates for individual pathogens and clinical efficacy by individual pathogens in the microITT and 
ME populations, supported the results observed in the primary efficacy analysis. This was also the case with the 
additional outcomes, i.e., clinical success at EOT, SFU and LFU based on the investigator’s assessment and early 
clinical response at 48-72 hours in the ITT population.

There is no concern on efficacy in the subset of patients with bacteraemia associated to ABSSSI.  The number 
of bacteraemic cases and the clinical outcome is deemed sufficient to omit a cautionary statement in section 4.4 
of the SmPC regarding the numbers of cases of bacteraemia that have been treated.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study populations included in the new pivotal trials DUR001-301 and DUR001-302 are judged to be clinically 
relevant and representative for the applied indication. It is concluded that non-inferiority vs. the comparator has 
been sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of dalbavancin has been evaluated in 12 phase 1 studies (8 studies in healthy subjects, 4 studies in 
special populations), 2 phase 2 studies and 5 phase 3 studies. The clinical safety population consisted of all 
subjects who received any amount of study drug (defined as dalbavancin, comparator, or placebo). The program 
consisted  of  a  total  of  3442  subjects  (3431  adults  +11  adolescents),  2092  of  whom  were  treated  with 
dalbavancin and 1350 of whom were treated with a comparator (1276 active comparator and 74 placebo).  
For  the  3  double-blind  phase  3  studies,  VER001-9,  DUR001-301  and  DUR001-302,  safety  parameters  were 
monitored on treatment, at the end of treatment (EOT) and at test of cure (TOC). For study VER001-9, EOT 
occurred  on  day  14-17  And  TOC  in  study  VER001-9  occurred  on  day  28  .For  the  studies  DUR001-301  and 
DUR001-302, EOT was scheduled on day 14-15 and SFU on day 28 and LFU on day 70. 
Adverse events 
In the integrated phase 1 studies, the incidences of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation of study drug were higher 
in the total dalbavancin group compared to the comparator group and similar between the 3 dalbavancin dose 
groups (<500, 500-1000, and >1000 mg). 
In the phase 2/3 integrated analysis set, fewer subjects treated with dalbavancin experienced at least 1 TEAE, 
treatment-related TEAEs, and treatment-related SAEs than in the comparator group. The incidence of subjects 
experiencing  TEAEs  and  SAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug,  were  similar  between  the  total 
dalbavancin and total comparator treatment groups (see table below).

Table  22 
Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events: Phase 2/3 Integrated Analysis Set 
TEAEs reported for dalbavancin occurred in a majority (62.9%) of the study subjects in the phase 1 integrated 
analysis  set  vs.  29.5  %  in  the  comparator  group  (59.0%  were  given  placebo,  the  remaining  subjects  were 
administered a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin). The most common AEs include headache, infusion site pain, 
nausea, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infection, the latter probably not related to the drug.

Table  23 
1 Integrated Analysis Set 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in >2.0% of Total Dalbavancin Subjects: Phase 
In the phase 2/3 analysis set, the number of subjects with at least 1 TEAE among dalbavancin-treated subjects 
(44.9%)  was  slightly  lower  than  that  of  comparator-treated  subjects  (46.8%),  Table  21.  The  proportion  of 
subjects with at least 1 treatment-related TEAE was lower among dalbavancin-treated subjects (18.4%) than 
that of comparator-treated subjects (20.1%). The system organ class (SOC) most commonly affected by TEAEs 
was gastrointestinal disorders, where 15.5% of dalbavancin-treated subjects and 16.5% of comparator-treated 
subjects experienced TEAEs of this SOC.  
Nausea, diarrhoea and headache were the most common AEs related to the use of dalbavancin, occurring in 
2.8%, 2.5% and 1.5% of the subjects, respectively. 
There seem to be systematically lower incidences of almost all observed events (TEASs,  SAEs, withdrawals, 
deaths) in the phase 3 DUR001-301/302 Integrated analysis set compared to phase 2/3 integrated analysis set. 
There is also a trend towards lower incidences of AEs in the dalbavancin treatment arm compared to comparator 
within each integrated data set. The applicant has discussed the possible reasons for the observed differences in 
the  reported  AE  frequencies,  and  suggests  that  the  observed  difference  in  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse 
events  between  clinical  studies  may  include  varying  practices  of  reporting  adverse  events  in  individual 
geographic regions and indications studied in each group. However, the incidence was approximately similar 
between the treatment arms within the sets.

Phase 2/3 Integrated Analysis Set 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in >2% of the Subjects in Any Treatment Group: 
Adverse events of specific interest 
Renal adverse events 
In the phase 2/3 integrated analysis set, the frequency of renal AEs and treatment-related renal and urinary AEs 
was similar between subjects treated with dalbavancin (1.9% and 0.2%, respectively) and subjects treated with 
a comparator (2.0% and 0.4%, respectively).  
Of the 16 cases of renal failure (PTs of acute pre-renal failure, renal failure, and acute renal failure), none of the 
6 cases in dalbavancin-treated subjects were considered by the investigator to be related to treatment, and 3 
(0.2%) of the 10 cases in comparator-treated subjects were considered by the investigator to be possibly or 
probably related to treatment.  
The frequency of serious renal and urinary disorder AEs was similar between subjects treated with dalbavancin 
(0.2%)  and  subjects  treated  with  a  comparator  (0.5%).  Serious  renal  disorder  AEs  in  subjects  treated  with 
dalbavancin  included  hydronephrosis,  nephrolithiasis,  renal  failure,  and  renal  failure  acute,  each  of  which 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 75/103 
  
  
 
occurred in 0.1% of subjects. None of the serious renal disorder AEs in subjects treated with dalbavancin were 
considered related to treatment.  
When subjects were categorized by baseline CrCl, the percent of subjects with at least 1 AE was similar amongst 
the 3 groups categorized by baseline creatinine clearance. The percent of subjects with at least 1 AE in the renal 
and urinary disorders SOC was higher in subjects with a baseline CrCl below 60 mL/min (3.5%) compared with 
subjects with a baseline value of 60-89 (2.0%) and ≥90 mL/min (1.1%). 
Auditory and vestibular effects 
Audiology was evaluated in the 6 phase 1 studies (VER 001-1,-2,-3,-10,-12,-13) where audiology was part of 
the studies. In the dalbavancin development program, a total of 105 phase 1 subjects dosed with dalbavancin 
have undergone stringent audiologic testing according to the applicant.  
A careful review of the audiology results for VER001-3, VER001-10, VER001-12 and VER001-13, which included 
subjects > 65 years of age and patients with renal impairment (mild and moderate RI), did not find the results 
to be suggestive of any pattern of ototoxic change associated with dalbavancin.  
In the phase 2/3 set, 6 dalbavancin-treated subjects (0.4%), experienced vertigo (3 subjects), tinnitus (2) and 
hypoacusis (1), whereas one (0.1%) in the comparator group reported a hearing adverse event. 2 events of 
tinnitus and 1 of vertigo were considered possibly related to the study drug (all dalbavancin). A few patients 
experience dizziness events that possibly were related to dalbavancin treatment.  None of the cases of dizziness 
(related and unrelated cases) in the dalbavancin treatment group were associated with hearing impairment. 
Overall, there seems to be no pattern of ototoxic change associated with dalbavancin at the proposed dosing 
regimen. However, dalbavancin is chemically related to the glycopeptides teicoplanin and vancomycin which 
both are associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, thus, a potential ototoxicity effect cannot be excluded 
after prolonged treatment and repeated treatment of dalbavancin. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
The frequency of individual hepatobiliary AEs in the phase 2/3 set was similar between subjects treated with 
dalbavancin (0.1-1.7%) and subjects treated with a comparator (0.1-1.6%). The frequency of hepatobiliary AEs 
was comparable between subjects who received 1 dose or 2 doses of dalbavancin. 
The frequency of treatment-related AEs in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC was similar between subjects treated 
with dalbavancin (0.3%) and subjects treated with a comparator (0.1%). The frequency of serious hepatobiliary 
disorder AEs was similar between subjects treated with dalbavancin and subjects treated with a comparator 
(0.2% in each group). None of the serious hepatobiliary disorder AEs were considered related to treatment and 
none had an outcome of death. 
Adverse events potentially related to haematology effects 
The  AEs  related  to  haematology  effects  are  summarized  for  the  phase  2/3  subjects  in  the  following  table. 
Dalbavancin seems to be associated with anaemia to the same extent as the drugs in the comparator regimens 
(including  the  myelosuppressive  agent  linezolid),  1.9%  vs.  1.6%.  The  corresponding  figures  for 
treatment-related anaemia were 0.3% vs. 0% respectively. The frequency of anaemia was comparable between 
subjects who received 1 dose or 2 doses of dalbavancin.

Results  from  a  thorough  QT  trial  (TQT),  study  DUR001-102  was  provided.  Study  DUR001-102  was  a 
single-centre, randomized, single-dose, placebo- and positive controlled, partially double-blind, parallel-group 
ECG study on 198 subjects. The results of the adequately designed and conducted thorough QT study on 99 
healthy subjects given a therapeutic (1000 mg) or supratherapeutic (1500 mg) dose of dalbavancin (99 subjects 
received placebo or moxifloxacin), indicate that dalbavancin does not prolong the QTc interval and the drug had 
no effect on the heart rate, PR or QRS interval. 
The ECG results of the phase 2/3 integrated analysis set demonstrated that dalbavancin does not exhibit any 
impact on heart rate, PR or QRS interval.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No  subject  died  during  the  phase  1  clinical  studies.  All  together  during  the  phase  2/3  studies,  10 
dalbavancin-treated subjects (of 1778 patients) and 15 comparator-treated (of 1224 patients) subjects died. All 
of the 10 deaths that occurred in the dalbavancin arms in the phase 2/3 set and were all considered as unrelated 
or unlikely related to the drug.  
Serious adverse events 
The proportion of subjects experiencing SAEs was low and similar in the dalbavancin and comparator groups in 
the phase 1 set (1.4% vs. 0%) and the phase 2/3 (6.1% vs. 6.5%) set (see following table). There were no 
severe AEs that were related to the dalbavancin treatment in the phase 1 set.  
Three of 1778 patients (0.2%) treated with dalbavancin and 9/1224 (0.7%) patients treated with a comparator 
agent were reported to have treatment-related SAEs in the Phase 2/3 integrated analysis set. 
The proportions of dalbavancin-treated subjects and comparator-treated subjects who had at least 1 SAE that 
led to discontinuation of study drug were similar, 1.2% vs. 1.1%. 
Cellulitis, experienced by 4 (0.2%) dalbavancin-treated subjects and 2 (0.2%) comparator-treated subjects, 
was the most frequently occurring SAE that led to discontinuation of study drug for subjects in the phase 2/3 set. 
Necrotising fasciitis and subcutaneous abscess were SAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug for 2 (0.1%) 
dalbavancin-treated  subjects  each;  no  comparator-treated  subject  experienced  necrotizing  fasciitis  or 
subcutaneous abscess leading to discontinuation of study drug. These SAE’s may also be considered therapeutic 
failure.

The  incidences  of  subjects  with  potentially  clinically  significant  (PCS)  hematology  values  that  were  also 
potentially  clinically  significant  changes  (PCSC)  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  in  the  phase  1 
integrated analysis set, phase 2/3 integrated analysis set, and phase 3 DUR001-301/302 integrated analysis 
set, see table below. At TOC, the number of tested subjects was substantially lower. 
Thrombocytosis also occurred in both treatment groups (dalbavancin 0.6%) in the phase 2/3 set.

The majority of subjects in both treatment groups with hepatobiliary abnormalities had elevations in ALT and 
AST that were >ULN to 3×ULN. Less or equal to 2% of dalbavancin-treated and comparator-treated subjects 
had ALT or AST abnormalities that were >3×ULN.  
The frequency of subjects with very high levels (>10xULN) of aminotransferases noted post- baseline was low 
and similar between treatment groups (3 subjects in each treatment group). There was no evidence of altered 
liver function accompanying or promptly following elevation of aminotransferases such as an increase in serum 
total bilirubin unexplained by other causes. There were no cases of Hy's law seen in the dalbavancin clinical 
program.  
Out  of  the  subjects  that  had  an  ALT  <ULN  at  baseline,  ALT  was  still  elevated  in  6.0%  (47/778)  of  the 
dalbavancin-treated subjects at TOC. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Females more frequently reported adverse events than males, but there were no major differences between the 
dalbavancin-treated group vs the comparator group of study subjects related to gender. 
Age 
All causality adverse events were more common among dalbavancin treated subjects ≥ 65 years of age than in 
the  younger  age  group,  50.5%  of  subjects  vs.  43.8%.  But  treatment-related  TEAEs  and  treatment-related 
TEAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  did  not  differ  between  the  2  age  groups.  In  the  phase  2/3 
integrated analysis set, gastrointestinal disorders SOC were the most commonly reported TEAEs in subjects ≥65 
years  of  age  and  <65  years  of  age  in  the  dalbavancin  group  (17.9%  and  14.9%,  respectively),  and  in  the 
comparator group (14.8% and 16.9%, respectively).  
Adverse event rates based on various age categories for dalbavancin-treated patients and comparator-treated 
patients in the Phase 2/3 database are presented in the tables below. As expected, the AE rate for older patients 
in  both  treatment  groups  is  generally  higher  than  that  observed  in  younger  patients.  An  exception  is  the 
observed frequency of SAE’s in dalbavancin-treated subjects older than 75 years of age which is slightly lower 
than that observed in subjects 65 to 74 years of age, however, the number of patients in the oldest age group 
is small.

Subjects with impaired renal function. 
Phase1 integrated analysis set  
There were two phase 1 studies (VER001-11 and VER001-13) that evaluated the safety of 500 mg or 1000 mg 
of dalbavancin in a single dose in subjects with mild (CrCl 50-79 mL/min), moderate (30-49 mL/min), or severe 
renal impairment (<30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (haemodialysis-dependent), and in healthy subjects 
with normal renal function (CrCl ≥80 mL/min).  
28  subjects  with  renal  impairment  were  included;  6  had  mild,  6  had  moderate  and  16  had  severe  renal 
impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease.  Overall,  dalbavancin  was  well  tolerated  in  subjects  with  renal 
impairment. 
Phase 2/3 integrated analysis set  
A total of 1436 patients with different degrees of renal impairment (Dalbavancin; mild RI: N=504, moderate RI:

In  subjects  that  received  dalbavancin  or  comparator  in  the  30  to  59,  60  to  89,  and  ≥90  mL/min  groups, 
incidences of subjects with TEAEs were similar between treatment groups. Although, due to the small sample 
sizes  for  subjects  with  baseline  CrCl  values  <30  mL/min,  there  were  insufficient  data  to  make  meaningful 
comparisons by baseline renal impairment that include these subjects. 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were the most commonly reported TEAEs for subjects in the dalbavancin group 
with baseline CrCl values in each of the CrCl value categories and ranged from 14.3 % to 18.8 %.  
Subjects with impaired hepatic function 
In the phase 1 set, dalbavancin was well tolerated in 17 subjects with mild to severe hepatic impairment that 
were given 1000 mg on day 1 and 500 mg on day 8.  
Immunological/allergic/skin-associated events 
Phase 1 integrated analysis set 
In  the  dalbavancin  phase  1  set,  15  events  of  various  skin  reactions  occurred  including  one  with  respiratory 
symptoms.  Two  cases  were  considered  as  possibly  or  probably  related  to  dalbavancin  (urticaria  and  facial 
flushing combined with respiratory symptoms) and there were another 13 events of skin reactions (e.g. rash, 
erythema and red man syndrome) reported to be associated with the use of the drug.  
Phase 2/3 integrated analysis set 
The frequency of individual AEs representing potential allergic reactions was similar between subjects treated 
with dalbavancin (0.1-2.1%) and subjects treated with a comparator (0.1-1.8%), see table below. Subjects who 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 87/103 
  
  
 
 
 
 
received 2 doses of dalbavancin doses experienced slightly more allergic reactions than those who received 1 
dose: 58/1440 (4.0%) vs. 11/338 (3.3%), respectively.   
One event of anaphylactoid reaction occurred in a dalbavancin-treated subject. The applicant has proposed to 
include the following sentence in Section 4.4 “If an allergic reaction to Xydalba occurs, administration should be 
discontinued and appropriate therapy for the allergic reaction should be instituted” which is endorsed. 
The duration of treatment-related skin rash in the dalbavancin treatment group was roughly similar (or possibly 
shorter) to that observed in the comparator treatment group (median: 7 days vs 7 days; mean: 5.6 days vs 9.8 
days). There does not seem to be any indication of a longer duration of the skin reactions when compared to the 
comparator. Skin events accounted for 48% of the events that led to premature discontinuation of dalbavancin. 
However, the premature discontinuation rate was low as such and occurred to a similar extent in the dalbavancin 
and comparator groups.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The limited clinical information obtained on concomitant drug therapy during dalbavancin treatment does not 
indicate any important drug-drug interactions. The safety of combining dalbavancin with drugs that are nephro- 
or ototoxic (class-related concerns for glycopeptides) has not been fully clarified.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of subjects who had at least 1 TEAE that resulted in discontinuation of study drug was similar 
between subjects treated with dalbavancin (3.0%) and subjects treated with the comparator (2.9%), see table 
below.

Adverse Events Resulting in Discontinuation of Study Drug in ≥2 Subjects in any Treatment 
Group: Phase 2/3 Integrated Analysis Set  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  size  of  the  safety  database  for  dalbavancin  exceeds  ICH  suggestions,  (1230  subjects  in  3  double-blind 
pivotal studies on the sought indication cSSSI/ABSSSI, but also another 859 subjects in 17 Phase 1, 2 and 3 
studies).  
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 89/103 
  
  
 
 
The  most  common  adverse  events  occurring  during  dalbavancin  treatment  are  nausea  (5.5%),  headache 
(4.7%), diarrhea (4.4%), constipation (2.9%) and vomiting (2.8%). The symptoms were of mild to moderate 
intensity in almost all subjects. The median duration of nausea, headache and diarrhoea was 1.0 to 2.0 days.  
Three of 1778 patients (0.2%) treated with dalbavancin and 9/1224 (0.7%) patients treated with a comparator 
agent were reported to have treatment-related SAEs in the Phase 2/3 integrated analysis set. In the pool of the 
phase  2/3  studies  a  total  of  10  deaths  (0.56%)  were  reported  in  the  dalbavancin-group  compared  with  15 
deaths (1.2%) in the comparator group. All of the 10 deaths that occurred in the dalbavancin arms in the phase 
2/3 set and were all considered as unrelated or unlikely related to the drug. 
The frequency of individual potential allergic reactions (mainly skin events) was 0.1-2.1% for subjects treated 
with  dalbavancin.  Subjects  given  2  dalbavancin  doses  developed  slightly  more  allergic  reactions  than  those 
administered 1 dose. One event of anaphylactoid reaction occurred in a dalbavancin-treated subject and an 
adequate  warning  has  been  included  in  SmPC  section.  The  duration  of  treatment-related  skin  rash  in  the 
dalbavancin  treatment  group  was  roughly  similar  (or  possibly  shorter)  to  that  observed  in  the  comparator 
treatment group (median: 7 days vs 7 days; mean: 5.6 days vs 9.8 days). There does not seem to be any 
indication  of  a  longer  duration  of  the  skin  reactions  when  compared  to  the  comparator.  The  premature 
discontinuation rate was low as such and occurred to a similar extent in the dalbavancin and comparator groups. 
The hepatobiliary effects noted during dalbavancin treatment are mild to moderate elevations of the hepatic 
enzymes. No cases fulfilling Hy's law criteria were seen. Hepatobiliary events and elevations of ALT, AST and 
gamma-glytamyl transferase occur more frequently after 2 doses of dalbavancin than after 1 dose of the drug. 
The frequency of individual hepatobiliary AEs was for the dalbavancin group 0.1-1.7% vs. for the comparator 
group  0.1-1.6%,  and  the  frequency  of  treatment-related  hepatobiliary  events  was  0.3%  in  the  dalbavancin 
phase  2/3  set  compared  to  0.1%  for  the  comparator  drugs.  There  were  no  serious  liver  adverse  events 
considered to be related to dalbavancin. To conclude, the use of dalbavancin is associated with a small risk of 
mild to moderate hepatobiliary effects. The SmPC section is considred adequate.  
Regarding potential hematology effect, a similar number of patients were reported to have an AE of anaemia in 
the  dalbavancin  (1.9  %)  and  comparator  (1.6%)  treatment  groups  in  the  phase  2/3  dataset,  and  the  shift 
analysis  shows  that  also  similar  frequencies  of  patients  treated  with  dalbavancin  had  haematocrit  or 
haemoglobin values lower than the normal range post-baseline relative to the comparator-treated group (in 
patients having normal values at baseline). Only one treatment-related SAE of myelosuppression was reported 
in the dalbavancin treatment group. This was a mild transient case of leukopenia. In addition similar frequencies 
in dalbavancin-treated patients had significant haemoglobin and haematocrit changes postbaseline relative to 
comparator-treated patients. Thus, there is no apparent evidence of myelosuppression or of anaemia associated 
with dalbavancin in this clinical setting and at the duration of treatment in the present clinical studies. 
Three  subjects  had  a  C.  difficile  diarrhoea/colitis  of  moderate  intensity  that  was  considered  related  to 
dalbavancin and an adequate warning has been included in SmPC section 4.4. 
The frequency of all renal and urinary events in the phase 2/3 set was similar between subjects treated with 
dalbavancin and the comparator group, 1.9% vs. 2.0%, and the corresponding figures for treatment-related 
renal  and  urinary  events  were  0.2%  and  0.5%  respectively.  Only  dysuria  and  pollakiuria  were  considered 
related to dalbavancin. Six events of renal failure occurred among dalbavancin-treated subjects although none 
of  the  cases  are  considered  to  be  related  to  dalbavancin  treatment.  No  serious  renal  adverse  event  was 
considered related to dalbavancin treatment.  
Audiology assessment was included in a sufficient number of subjects. A careful review of the audiology results 
for VER001-3, VER001-10, VER001-12 and VER001-13, which included subjects > 65 years of age and patients 
Assessment report

Page 90/103 
  
  
with renal impairment (mild and moderate RI), did not find the results to be suggestive of any pattern of ototoxic 
change associated with dalbavancin. In the phase 2/3 set, 6 dalbavancin-treated subjects (0.4%), experienced 
vertigo (3 subjects), tinnitus (2) and hypoacusis (1), whereas one (0.1%) in the comparator group reported a 
hearing adverse event. Two events of tinnitus and 1 of vertigo were considered possibly related to the study 
drug (all dalbavancin). A few patients experienced dizziness events that possibly were related to dalbavancin 
treatment. None of the cases of dizziness (related and unrelated cases) in the dalbavancin treatment group were 
associated with hearing impairment. Overall, there seems to be no pattern of ototoxic change associated with 
dalbavancin at the proposed dosing regimen. However, dalbavancin is chemically related to the glycopeptides 
teicoplanin  and  vancomycin  which  both  are  associated  with  nephrotoxicity  and  ototoxicity,  thus,  a  potential 
ototoxicity effect can not be excluded after prolonged treatment and repeated treatment of dalbacancin. 
Regarding drug interaction studies the limited clinical information obtained on concomitant drug therapy during 
dalbavancin  treatment  does  not  indicate  any  important  drug-drug  interactions.  The  safety  of  combining 
dalbavancin with drugs that are nephro- or ototoxic (class-related concerns for glycopeptides) has not been fully 
clarified. 
The overall incidences of TEAEs in the subpopulations, i.e. sex, age, renal and hepatic function were analysed. 
There was no large difference noted in the subgroups. Although it is emphasised that only few (N=32) subjects 
with  severe  renal  impairment  were  included  which  preclude  any  meaningful  comparisons  by  baseline  renal 
impairment that include these subjects. 
Overall,  the  available  safety  data  indicate  that  dalbavancin  is  tolerated  to  the  same  extent  as  the  used 
comparator drugs, mainly linezolid, vancomycin and cefazolin. Gastrointestinal symptoms, headache and rash 
of  mild  to  moderate  intensity  are  common  adverse  reactions.  Hematology  effects  and  mild  to  moderate 
hepatobiliary effects are uncommon reactions, but elevations of various hepatobiliary parameters are common. 
However, dalbavancin is chemically related to the glycopeptides teicoplanin and vancomycin. The adverse effect 
profile of dalbavancin is similar to these drugs with 2 important exceptions: vancomycin and teicoplanin are both 
associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity; dalbavancin on the other hand, has not clearly been associated 
with such toxicities. In clinical practice, a need for prolonged treatment and repeated treatment of dalbavancin 
can be foreseen, thus there is a potential risk for off-label use.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of dalbavancin is as expected for a glycopeptide antibiotic. There was no apparent 
safety issues for which dalbavancin were markedly worse than the comparators. The available clinical safety 
data of dalbavancin indicate that the safety profile of dalbavancin in the applied indication of cSSTI may be 
considered acceptable.

The use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. If 
superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.” 
Section 5.1: 
“Mechanism of resistance 
All Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to dalbavancin. 
Resistance to dalbavancin in Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. is mediated by VanA, 
a genotype that results in modification of the target peptide in nascent cell wall. Based on in 
vitro studies the activity of dalbavancin is not affected by other classes of vancomycin 
resistance genes. 
Dalbavancin MICs are higher for vancomycin-intermediate staphylococci (VISA) than for fully 
vancomycin susceptible strains. If the isolates with higher dalbavancin MICs represent stable 
phenotypes and are correlated with resistance to the other glycopeptides, then the likely 
mechanism would be an increase in the number of glycopeptide targets in nascent 
peptidoglycan.  
Cross-resistance between dalbavancin and other classes of antibiotics was not seen in in vitro 
studies. Methicillin resistance has no impact on dalbavancin activity.”

subsequent to the treatment with dalbavancin (see section 4.8). In such circumstance, the 
discontinuation of dalbavancin and the use of supportive measures together with the 
administration of specific treatment for Clostridium difficile should be considered. These

chronic renal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who are not 
receiving regular haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).” 
Section 4.2: 
“Renal impairment 
Dose adjustments are not required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to 79 ml/min). Dose adjustments are not required for patients 
receiving regularly scheduled haemodialysis (3 times/week), and dalbavancin may be 
administered without regard to the timing of haemodialysis. 
In patients with chronic renal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who

dalbavancin doses of 1000 mg and 15 mg/kg, with mean values of 227 and 202 hours, 
respectively. The safety profile of dalbavancin in the subjects aged between 12 and 16 years

SmPC wording 
Section 4.6: 
“Pregnancy 
None proposed 
There are no data from the use of dalbavancin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Xydalba is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether dalbavancin is excreted in human milk. However, dalbavancin is 
excreted in the milk of lactating rats and may be excreted in human breast milk. Dalbavancin 
is not well absorbed orally; however an impact on the gastrointestinal flora or mouth flora of 
a breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made  whether to 
continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Xydalba taking 
into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown reduced fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown.” 
Section 5.3: 
“Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of a teratogenic effect. 
In rats, at exposures approximately 3 times above clinical exposure, there was reduced 
fertility and an increased incidence of embryo-lethality, reductions in foetal weight and 
skeletal ossification and increased neonatal mortality. In rabbits abortion occurred in 
conjunction with maternal toxicity at exposures below the human therapeutic range.”

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Dalbavancin is a second generation semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic structurally related to teicoplanin. 
Its mechanism of action, like that of other glycopeptides, involves the interruption of cell wall synthesis which 
results  in  bacterial  cell  death.  Dalbavancin  is  active  against  important  groups  of  Gram-positive  bacteria, 
including  strains  of  methicillin  resistant  Staphylococcus  aureus  (MRSA)  and  some  S.  aureus  with  reduced 
Assessment report

susceptibility  to  glycopeptides  (GISA),  as  well  as  pathogenic  streptococci.  Its  in  vitro  activity  has  been 
substantiated in various animal models of infection and it possesses a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile which allows 
once-weekly intravenous (IV) dosing. Dalbavancin is administered as an initial 1000-mg dose, followed by a 
500-mg dose one week later. This might be an advantage for the patients compared to other antibiotics used for 
treating the same infection type and which have to be injected more frequently (typically every 12th or 24th 
hour). Dosages should be adjusted for renal insufficiency. 
The  efficacy  of  dalbavancin  for  the  targeted  treatment  indication  cSSTI  was  evaluated  in  3  phase  3  studies 
(DUR001-301,  DUR001-302,  and  VER001-9).  Patients  with  infections  consistent  with  cSSTI,  defined  as 
infections involving deeper soft tissue or requiring significant surgical intervention, were eligible for enrolment 
into the 3 pivotal studies. 
A sufficiently large proportion of patients enrolled in the two recent pivotal studies had severe infections as 
judged by SIRS criteria. Non-inferiority of dalbavancin compared to vancomycin/linezolid for the primary end 
point, clinical success at EOT in the CE population,  was demonstrated in study DUR001-301 (87.0% versus 
91.4%) and DUR001-302 (93.5% versus 92.7%). The lower limit of the 95% CI was well within -10%, although 
a tendency to lower success rate was noticed in study DUR001-301. The outcome in the ITT population was well 
in  line  of  that  of  the  CE  population.  Consistency  in  secondary  endpoints,  clinical  response  at  48-72  hours 
post-study drug initiation in the ITT population; study DUR001-301 (83.3% versus 81.8%) and DUR001-302 
(76.8% versus 78.3%), as well as for clinical success at SFU (day 28) in the CE population; study DUR001-301 
(93.8%  versus  96.1%)  and  DUR001-302  (96.3%  versus  94.5%),  for  dalbavancin  and  vancomycin/linezolid, 
respectively.  
In study VER001-9 the outcome for the primary endpoint clinical cure at TOC demonstrated non-inferiority to 
linezolid.  Primary  endpoint  clinical  response  rate  at  TOC  in  the  CE  population  (88.9%  versus  91.2%, 
respectively, treatment difference -2.2, 95%CI -7.28, 2.86).  
In the phase 3 studies DUR001-301 and -302, the most common categories of infection were cellulitis (52% to 
55%) in contrast to study VER001-9 where little less than 30% were categorized as cellulitis. In that study there 
was a category of deep soft tissue infection (approximately 16%). Major cutaneous abscess constituted 23.6% 
to 30.2% in the two more recent studies, similar as in the older study, which is in line with current EU guidance. 
Further, the Addendum to the antibacterial guideline states that patients should demonstrate a protocol-defined 
minimum  number  of  signs  and  symptoms  associated  with  an  ongoing  acute  infectious  process,  which  was 
generally fulfilled for the patients included in these two more recently performed studies.  
The CHMP agreed to a change of the wording of the proposed indication from “treatment of complicated skin and 
soft tissue infections (cSSTI)” to “treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI)” that 
describes better the patient population enrolled in the pivotal trials, namely that the types of infections treated 
were confined to cellulitis/erysipelas, abscesses and wound infections. 
The most commonly isolated pathogen in the three  phase 3 studies  was Staphylococcus aureus, of which a 
various  part  consisted  of  MRSA  (range  65-81%),  followed  by  Streptococcus  pyogenes.  The  by-pathogen 
microbial response data from the phase 3 studies indicate non-inferiority to the comparators in key species, as 
supported by in vitro microbiology data. 
Clinical success rates at EOT were similar in the dalbavancin and vancomycin/linezolid groups for all infection 
types. The numerically highest response rate was generally demonstrated for major abscesses, regardless of 
treatment.  
There  was  no  indication  on  differences  in  clinical  outcome  between  treatment  groups  in  respect  of  baseline 
demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race or ethnicity, severity of illness, presence of bacteraemia 
or by a history of diabetes mellitus.  Also, the number of bacteraemic cases and the associated clinical outcome 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 99/103 
  
  
 
are deemed sufficient to omit a cautionary statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the numbers of cases 
of bacteraemia that have been treated. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Efficacy  data  of  dalbavancin  beyond  two  weeks  treatment  is  limited.  Also,  there  is  no  experience  with 
dalbavancin in the treatment of severely immunocompromised patients. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of dalbavancin is as expected for a glycopeptide antibiotic. There were no apparent 
safety issues for which dalbavancin was markedly worse compared to comparators. 
The most frequent unfavourable effects associated with dalbavancin are nausea, diarrhoea and headache. These 
adverse reactions were of mild to moderate intensity, the median duration was 2 days, and they were therefore 
not considered to be of considerable clinical importance. 
The most important unfavourable effects associated with the use of dalbavancin are skin-associated reactions 
(0.1-1%) which occurred to a similar extent in the comparator group. Subjects given two dalbavancin doses 
developed slightly more allergic reactions than those administered one dose. The duration of treatment-related 
skin rash in the dalbavancin treatment group was roughly similar (or possibly shorter) than that observed in the 
comparator treatment group. The premature discontinuation rate was low as such and occurred to a similar 
extent  in  the  dalbavancin  and  comparator  groups.  One  event  of  anaphylactoid  reaction  occurred  in  a 
dalbavancin-treated subject and as a result an adequate warning has been included in the SmPC. 
The use of dalbavancin is associated with a small risk of mild to moderate hepatobiliary effects. There is no 
apparent evidence of myelosuppression or of anaemia associated with dalbavancin in this clinical setting and at 
the duration of treatment in the present clinical studies. Relevant information is included in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Renal adverse effects are considered important potential unfavourable effects, because dalbavancin belongs to 
the group of nephro-and ototoxic glycopeptides.  
The frequency of all renal and urinary events in the phase 2/3 set was similar between subjects treated with 
dalbavancin and the comparator group, 1.9% vs. 2.0%, and the corresponding figures for treatment-related 
renal  and  urinary  events  were  0.2%  and  0.5%  respectively.  Only  dysuria  and  pollakiuria  were  considered 
related  to  dalbavancin.  No  serious  renal  adverse  event  was  considered  related  to  dalbavancin  treatment. 
Although it is emphasised that only few (N=32) subjects with severe renal impairment were included which 
preclude any meaningful comparisons by baseline renal impairment that include these subjects. 
Significant auditory effects have not been detected in the clinical trials, but are considered as important potential 
unfavourable effects, because dalbavancin belongs to the group of nephro-and ototoxic glycopeptides. Even 
though there seems to be no pattern of ototoxic change associated with dalbavancin at the proposed dosing 
Assessment report  
EMA/39820/2015 
Page 100/103 
  
  
 
 
 
regimen, a potential ototoxicity effect cannot be excluded after prolonged treatment and repeated treatment of 
dalbavancin. 
In clinical practice, a need for prolonged treatment and repeated treatment of dalbavancin can be foreseen, thus 
there  is  a  potential  risk  for  off-label  use.  There  is  limited  data  on  dalbavancin  dosed  to  steady  state  and, 
available data show that weekly administrations (for up to eight weeks) do not result in dramatically elevated 
maximum concentrations through accumulation. 
There is a concern regarding development of resistance in bacterial isolates due to long half-life of dalbavancin. 
The results from studies performed hitherto indicate however that there is possibly low probability of selection 
for glycopeptide resistance. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In the era of escalating antimicrobial resistance world-wide, leading to an increasing number of patients that 
cannot be successfully treated for severe infections, there is a clear need of new antibacterial agents targeting 
multi-drug resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA and MRSE) as well as staphylococci 
with decreased susceptibility to currently available glycopeptides cause a real clinical threat in many settings. 
Dalbavancin  seems  to  have  the  potential  to  add  an alternative treatment  option  to other  glycopeptides and 
oxazolidinones, in terms of increased potency to certain resistance phenotypes and possibly by an improved 
safety profile. The characteristics of dalbavancin of once weekly dosage, may be convenient in clinical practice, 
but also a disadvantage from a safety perspective in case of toxic reactions. It might also pose concerns in 
regards to development of resistance in bacterial isolates and a potential risk of relapse in the longer term. 
The populations included in the two pivotal studies are considered to be representative for the target population. 
The adverse effect profile of dalbavancin is similar to those of other glycopeptides, with important exceptions: 
vancomycin and teicoplanin are both associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity; dalbavancin on the other 
hand, has not clearly been associated with such toxicities at the proposed dose regimen. However, in clinical 
practice, the occurrence of repeated treatment with dalbavancin cannot be excluded, necessitating the need to 
further monitor this. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP agreed that the overall benefit-risk balance of Xydalba is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Dalbavancin is considered to be a valuable addition to available treatment alternatives considering the potential 
extended  activity  against  glycopeptides  intermediate  susceptible  staphylococci  (GISA)  along  with  a  more 
convenient  dosage  regimen  of  Xydalba  compared  to  older  glycopeptides.  The  safety  characteristics  are 
sufficiently well characterised.

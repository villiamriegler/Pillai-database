1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited submitted on 14 October 2019 an application 
for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kaftrio, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on  
13 December 2018. 
Kaftrio was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/18/2116 on 14 December 2018 in the 
following condition: Treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
 “Kaftrio  is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0091/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-002324-PIP01-17 was not yet completed as 
some measures were deferred.  
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
New active Substance status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is a new active substance as elexacaftor is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union and it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any EU authorised active substance. 
Protocol assistance 
The applicant received the following Protocol assistance on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application:

The Protocol Assistance pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
•  Adequacy of the proposed clinical development plan to support an initial marketing authorisation 
application (MAA) for CF patients aged 12 and older heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a 
“MF” mutation, including a single 24-week pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 study in approximately 360 F/MF subjects with the primary endpoint absolute change in 
ppFEV1 at Week 4. The study would also assess the effect on pulmonary exacerbation rate. 
Specific questions were raised on the use of an interim analysis of the 4-week primary endpoint to 
support the MAA submission, and the proposed safety database. 
•  Acceptability of the proposed clinical development plan to support an expansion of the MAA 
indication to patients with CF aged 12 years and older who have the F508del mutation on at least 
1 allele, including a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled (TEZ/IVA), 4-week 
Phase 3 study in CF subjects, aged 12 years and older, with the F/F genotype with the primary 
endpoint absolute change in ppFEV1 at Week 4.

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene 
that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an 
epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and 
secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF.  
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein results in the 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, 
impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
F508del, is the most common disease-causing mutation (84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% 
of the individuals in Europe)1,2. With the proposed indication, this would result in treatment possibility 
in a vast majority of the patients.  
2.1.1.  Epidemiology 
CF affects approximately a total of 31,000 individuals in the US and a total of 42.000 in the EU 
(excluding the data from Russia, Turkey and Israel)1,2. The incidence and prevalence of CF varies 
between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North 
America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. In Europe, the median age of all CF 
patients is 18.5 years (with youngest patient being diagnosed just after birth and the oldest patients 
being 88.4 years of age). Despite advances in treatment, the current median age of death in a patient 
with CF was approximately 31 years in 2018, and the future predicted median age of survival is 
approximately 47 years1,2. 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (CL-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene 
have been identified.  
CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Class I mutations: Defective protein production  
Class II mutations: Defective protein processing  
Class III mutations: Defective regulation  
Class IV mutations: Defective chloride conduction  
Class V mutations: Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein (less transcription) 
Class I, II and III usually lead to a classic (severe) CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. 
Class IV and V are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.

The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR), which is considered a Class II 
mutation: it prevents most of the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no 
chloride transport. The decrease in the amount of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in 
the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR 
protein that reaches the cell surface also has defective channel gating and a decreased stability at the 
cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with F508del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at 
the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form of CF disease.  
More than 2000 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified. Most of these mutations are not 
associated with CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 database (an online resource that 
provides clinical and nonclinical data about CF-associated CFTR mutations) contains information on 412 
of these identified mutations, with sufficient evidence to define 346 mutations as disease causing. 
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport 
caused by the mutation. In general, a complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is 
referred to as “minimal function” of CFTR (class I, II and III). A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated 
chloride transport is referred to as “residual function” of CFTR (class IV and V). 
The applicant uses slightly different definitions, especially when considering “minimal function” 
mutations.  
•  Gating mutations (G) result in a CFTR protein with a primary defect of low channel open 
probability compared to normal CFTR. (comparable to Class III)  
•  Residual function (RF) mutations result in a more modest reduction in CFTR-mediated chloride 
transport than Class I mutations or minimal function mutations. (comparable to Class IV) 
•  Minimal function (MF) mutations produce (1) no CFTR protein or (2) a CFTR protein that is not 
responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro. (comparable to Class I) (see Table 8 overview of MF 
mutations used in study 102) 
For convenience, in this assessment report the definitions of the Applicant will be used, and 4 different 
CF population are described: 
•  Homozygous for F508del (F/F) 
•  Heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) 
•  Heterozygous for F508del and a gating mutation (F/G) 
•  Heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF) 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis. 
CF is diagnosed when both of the following criteria are met: 
•  Clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system (CLASSIC), or positive newborn 
screen or genetic testing for siblings of patients with CF  
AND 
•  Evidence of CFTR dysfunction (any of the following): 
o  Elevated sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L (CLASSIC) 
o  Presence of two disease-causing mutations in CFTR, one from each parental allele 
o  Abnormal nasal potential difference 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 11/12 
 
 
 
 
Around 2 % of patients lack one or more of the “CLASSIC” features. They may have milder clinical 
symptoms and/or normal to intermediate sweat chloride results. These patients can still be diagnosed 
with CF if they meet genetic or functional criteria3.  
2.1.4.  Management 
Existing treatments for CF can be broadly classified in 2 groups: (1) therapies that manage the 
symptoms, complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy) and (2) CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) which target 
the underlying cause of the disease. Concomitant administrations of these two groups is recommended 
to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and improve 
quality of life. 
(1)  CF therapies currently available, including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, 
target the downstream consequences and symptoms of the disease. These therapies are 
predominantly generic medicines authorized at a national level, apart from agents for the 
management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
(2)  CFTR modulators are small molecules that target specific defects caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene. Correctors (tezacaftor and lumacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
CFTR to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators (ivacaftor) increase the 
channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface 
to enhance chloride transport. A combination of a corrector and a potentiator, should results in 
sufficient levels of CFTR at the surface, which is then enhanced for its gating function. Kalydeco 
(ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, 
TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations. Not all CFTR 
genotypes are indicated for approved modulator therapies, and not all patients are able to tolerate 
the therapy. 
Therefore, the applicant continued to develop additional modulators that would drive higher levels of 
CFTR function from F508del-CFTR mutation. According to the Applicant, if a CFTR modulator regimen 
had a large enough effect on F508del-CFTR, then the presence of a single F508del allele alone would 
be sufficient to derive significant clinical benefit. That single regimen would be effective in all patients 
with at least one F508del allele, regardless of the mutation on the second allele. If the second allele is 
also responsive, any benefit derived from that allele would be in addition to the substantial benefit 
derived from the robust effect on F508del-CFTR. Importantly, for patients who have one F508del allele 
and are currently being treated with CFTR modulators (i.e. F/G and F/RF patients), their F508del allele 
seems not being fully leveraged because approved regimens primarily target the gating (IVA) or RF 
(IVA and TEZ/IVA) allele with limited modulation of the single F508del allele; these patients too would

Kaftrio belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of other respiratory system products with ATC code 
R07AX. Kaftrio is a triple combination product which contains the new CFTR modulator elexacaftor (VX-
445), and the known CFTR modulators ivacaftor and tezacaftor.  
Tezacaftor, as CFTR corrector, facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR (including 
F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, 
resulting in increased chloride transport. Ivacaftor, as a CFTR potentiator, potentiates the channel-

open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride transport. Elexacaftor, as 
next-generation CFTR corrector, also facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR. The 
product is considered to have a different chemical structure and a different mechanism of action as the 
first generations of CFTR correctors (TEZ, LUM) and potentiator (IVA).  
The combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor should result in increased quantity and 
function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport, airway surface liquid 
height, and ciliary beat frequency.  
The proposed posology for Kaftrio is as follows: 
-  Morning dose: 2 fixed-dose combinations (FDC) tablets (each containing elexacaftor 100 
mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg), supplied as an orange, film-coated tablet.  
- 
Evening dose: 1 tablet containing 150 mg of ivacaftor, supplied as a blue, film-coated tablet.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest in two subpopulations (F/MF and F/F) of the intended 
indication. 
This was based on: 
1)  Unmet need: Although for a majority of the intended target population approved treatment are 
available, these treatments can limit disease progression to a certain extent. Therefore, an unmet 
need could still be present. For the F/MF population, no modulator treatment is approved and 
therefore the unmet need could be acknowledged. 
2)  Efficacy: In the F/MF and F/F population benefits are observed for the triple combination 
compared to placebo, for lung function, sweat chloride and CFQ-R RD. These data appeared to 
support the claim that the triple combinations will be able to address the unmet need in these 
populations. No efficacy data were presented for the F/G and F/RF populations. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, since the applicant requested a 3 months clock stop ultimately reduced to 2 
months. Therefore, the conditions for accelerated assessment could no longer be met.

Of note, the ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances are identical to those used in Kalydeco 
(ivacaftor) tablets and granules (EMEA/H/C/002494), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) tablets 
(EMEA/H/C/003954) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) tablets (EMEA/H/C/004682), already approved 
in the EU. During the manufacture of the finished product, ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances 
are fully dissolved in a spray-drying solvent system and spray-dried to stabilise their amorphous forms 
into an intermediate, known as the spray-dried dispersion (SDD).  The ivacaftor and tezacaftor SDDs 
used in the manufacture of Kaftrio are the same as those used in the manufacture of the named 
approved products. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Ivacaftor 
Full information has been provided in the dossier for this active substance.  
The applicant has confirmed that “the quality data supporting the ivacaftor active substance and SDD 
used in the manufacture of the Kaftrio FDC finished product is identical to that submitted and currently 
approved for Kalydeco (EMEA/H/C/002494) and Symkevi (EMEA/H/C/004682)”. Therefore, detailed 
assessment of the already approved data supporting ivacaftor active substance and SDD has not been 
conducted within this marketing authorisation review. 
General information 
The  chemical-pharmaceutical  documentation  provided  for  ivacaftor  in  this  marketing  authorisation 
dossier is the same as provided and accepted for Kalydeco and Orkambi dossiers.  
The chemical name of ivacaftor is: N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-
3-carboxamide N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide.  
The compound has the following molecular structure: 
Figure 1: ivacaftor structure 
Molecular formula: C24H28N2O3                            Molecular weight: 392.49 g·mol-1 
Ivacaftor has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
The structure of ivacaftor has been confirmed by elemental analysis, 1H-, 13C- and two-dimensional 
NMR spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and crystallographic analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline slightly hygroscopic solid which is practically 
insoluble in water and buffers with pH 1.0-7.0, slightly soluble in ethanol, methanol and acetone and 
soluble in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran.   
Ivacaftor active substance shows polymorphism. Development studies resulted in the discovery of 25 
forms, 2 hydrates, and 19 solvated forms.  Techniques and approaches used to generate polymorphic 
forms included crash cooling, rapid solvent evaporation, anti-solvent addition precipitation, slurry 
techniques, thermal treatment of amorphous material, and chemical process development. XRPD, solid

state NMR, and synchrotron radiation were used to distinguish the forms. Spectroscopic methods 
(FTIR, Raman, solid state NMR), thermal analyses (thermal gravimetric analysis, differential scanning 
calorimetry), and moisture sorption/desorption analysis were used to characterize the individual neat 
polymorphs.  
The active substance produced by the proposed manufacturing process consists of a mixture of two 
major crystalline neat polymorphic forms. This is attributed to the fact that both forms nucleate under 
the process conditions used during the final crystallization step and conversion of one form into the 
other is slow and not typically completed before isolation of the active substance. The control of the 
final isolation and drying conditions ensures that mixtures of the neat crystalline forms is consistently 
produced. Nevertheless, the polymorphic form of ivacaftor during the synthesis of the active substance 
is not a critical quality attribute (CQA) since during the manufacture of the finished product, ivacaftor 
is fully dissolved in a spray-drying solvent system to provide an amorphous intermediate, the SDD, 
which is then converted to the final finished product. Therefore, ivacaftor’s physical form is only a CQA 
for ivacaftor SDD (spray dried dispersion) and the final tablets, since it is critical to maintain the 
amorphous form to ensure bioavailability.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A Quality by Design (QbD) approach was also used for the development of ivacaftor.  
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps using two commercially available well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications 
The starting materials were agreed during the assessment of the approved Kalydeco dossier. The 
synthetic routes for the starting materials have been described in detail and all potential related 
impurities or degradation products have been described and characterized. There are different 
suppliers for each starting material. However, the same synthetic route is used by the different 
suppliers of the same starting material. Description of the manufacturing process of the active 
substance including the in-process controls is adequate. 
A QbD approach has also been used in product and process development of ivacaftor. For the active 
substance synthesis, a combination of multivariate analyses and range-finding studies was used to 
define a design space for each step. All parameters with a potential impact on CQAs of the active 
substance were identified and thoroughly investigated. The applicant has proposed a combination of 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and design spaces for the manufacturing process of the active 
substance.  
Although the design spaces were developed at small laboratory scales, a design space verification 
protocol providing demonstration of the risk of scale dependence of the parameters which define each 
design space was submitted. For the first three design spaces the assessment concluded that there is 
low risk of scale dependence and, therefore, the ranges defined at laboratory scale are applicable to 
commercial scale. This is supported by confirmatory experiments and scale up/down calculations 
conducted at pilot scale at the higher risk points in the design space. For the fourth design space, the 
engineering-based assessment determined that there is a higher risk of scale dependence than for 
the other three design spaces. Data were collected from the commercial scale and multiple 
confirmatory experiments, supported by appropriate engineering modelling, and scale up/down 
calculations were conducted. The robustness of the process has been confirmed with the manufacture 
of fifteen large-scale batches of ivacaftor active substance, which have consistently met the 
acceptance criteria for all active substance CQAs. The available development data, the proposed 
control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed 
design spaces. 
Ivacaftor active substance is packaged inside a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag and secured with 
an appropriate closure (twist tie or equivalent). The bag is then placed inside a second LDPE bag and

secured appropriately; the closed LDPE bags are placed into a secondary container suitable for storage 
and shipping. The LDPE is compliant with the Directive 2002/72/EC and the European Pharmacopoeia 
Monograph 3.1.3 “Polyolefins”. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identification 
(FTIR), assay (HPLC), organic impurities (HPLC), acetamide (GC-MS), inorganic impurities-sulphated 
ash (Ph. Eur.), and residual solvents (GC).  
A detailed study on the potential, theoretical and observed organic impurities has been presented. 
Impurity limits in the specification are justified and found safe. The limit proposed for acetamide in the 
active substance has been established according to the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities. 
Limits for polymorphic form and particle size are not included; this is not necessary considering that 
the active substance is completely dissolved as part of the finished product manufacturing process. 
The limits set for specification parameters are acceptable and in line with batch results, stability 
studies and CHMP guidelines. Analytical methods used are sufficiently described and fully validated in 
line with the CHMP requirements.   
All batch results (including those of the batches used in the clinical studies) are in compliance with the 
proposed specification. 
Stability 
The stability data are the same as approved to date. Stability data on three pilot scale batches of 
active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for 60 
months under long term conditions at 30 °C / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 °C / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, related substances, water content, physical 
form, microbial limits and water activity. The analytical methods used were the same as for release, 
with the addition of XRPD for physical form determination, and were stability indicating. 
No trends in the assay or water content data were observed through 60months of storage at 30 °C / 
65% RH. Although a statistically significant trend was observed for these parameters on samples 
stored at 40 °C / 75% RH through 6 months, all results remained well within the commercial 
specification acceptance limit. The XRPD stability data show that ivacaftor remains crystalline at all test 
points under all storage conditions. In addition, data presented show no increase on water activity 
levels and no change in microbial content after storage for 12 months at 30 °C /6 5% RH. Thus, all 
tested parameters remained within the commercial specification acceptance limits.  
Ivacaftor active substance was also subjected to stress conditions including exposure to heat and heat 
combined with humidity for up to 21 days, treatment under acidic, basic, neutral and oxidative 
conditions for up to 14 days, exposure to pH 4 and pH 7 for up to 7 days and exposure to light 
conforming to ICH Q1B option 2 requirements. Ivacaftor was found to be the least stable under basic 
conditions and when in solution exposed to light. No degradation was observed when ivacaftor was 
exposed to the other stress conditions. Analysis of the stressed samples confirmed that the commercial 
HPLC method for assay and organic impurities determination in ivacaftor active substance is stability 
indicating. 
In addition, photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.   
The data, showing no changes in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, confirm that 
ivacaftor active substance is photostable and therefore does not require light protective packaging.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months in the proposed 
container closure system, which is the one authorised in Kalydeco and Orkambi. 
Tezacaftor 
Full information has been provided in the dossier for this active substance. The applicant has confirmed 
in their cover Letter that “the quality data supporting the tezacaftor active substance and SDD used in 
the manufacture of the Kaftrio FDC finished product is identical to that submitted and currently 
approved for Symkevi 100/150 mg film-coated tablets (EMEA/H/C/004682 - EU/1/18/1306/001)”. This 
has been supplemented in Kaftrio dossier with additional batch analysis and stability data. Therefore, 
detailed assessment of the already approved data supporting tezacaftor active substance and SDD has 
not been conducted within this marketing authorisation review. 
General information 
The chemical name of tezacaftor is: 1-(2,2-difluoro-2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-{1-[(2R)-2,3-
dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-1Hindol-5-yl}cyclopropane-1-
carboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula C26H27N2F3O6. It has a molecular weight of 
520.50 g/mol and the following molecular structure: 
Figure 2: tezacaftor structure  
Tezacaftor exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The active substance is 
the R-isomer. The chirality of the active substance is assured by chiral control of the starting materials. 
The downstream chemistry does not promote racemization of the stereocenter.  This was supported by 
spiking and stability studies. 
The chemical structure of tezacaftor was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 1H, 13C, 
and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, IR and Raman spectroscopy, high resolution mass 
spectrometry and crystallographic analysis.  
Tezacaftor is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white crystalline solid. The substance is practically 
insoluble in aqueous solvents and more soluble in organic solvents. Because of its poor solubility in 
water, a SDD, where the active substance is in an amorphous form to provide sufficient oral 
bioavailability was developed (see finished product section). 
Physical characterization of tezacaftor was conducted by X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning 
calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis and dynamic vapour sorption. The physical form of tezacaftor 
active substance manufactured by the proposed commercial process is the most thermodynamically 
stable crystalline neat form. To understand the polymorph landscape of tezacaftor, a comprehensive 
polymorph screening for neat forms, solvates, and hydrates was conducted. Two neat forms were 
found. No hydrate has been found from multiple aqueous-based solvent systems.  
During the manufacture of the SDD, tezacaftor is completely dissolved in methanol process solvent, 
therefore polymorphic form and particle size are not CQAs.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing process for the synthesis of tezacaftor involves seven steps from 
commercially available well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications and several 
crystallizations.   
The selected starting materials in the synthesis are approvable, in view of ICH Q11 and its Q&A, and 
the CHMP guideline on chemistry of the active substance (EMA/454576/2016); sufficient justification 
and discussion for the choice of these compounds is provided. The names and addresses of the starting 
material manufacturers/suppliers are laid down in the dossier. This also holds regarding the synthesis 
routes of the starting materials applied by the manufacturers/suppliers. Two active substances 
manufacturers which use the same route of synthesis are proposed. After the initial marketing 
authorisation for Symkevi, the applicant submitted a variation to make some changes to the 
manufacturing process of tezacaftor while maintaining consistent solution yields. The procedure for 
downstream steps remained the same. This change does not have any effect on the quality of the 
active substance. 
Following  an  enhanced  QbD  quality  approach,  the  tezacaftor  active  substance  manufacturing  process 
was risk assessed to determine which process parameters had the potential to have the greatest impact 
on tezacaftor CQAs. On this basis, both critical and non-critical parameters have been defined to describe 
the  manufacturing  process  and  process  controls.  Design  spaces  have  been  established  for  several 
process steps, based on Designs of experiments (DoE) studies performed.  
The DoE studies to support the design spaces were based on full factorial and fractional factorial 
designs with resolutions at mainly levels IV, based on the risk assessments as done for Orkambi 
development. The resulting design spaces are considered acceptable. 
Design space verification was completed for each unit operation in line with EMA “Questions and 
Answers on Design Space Verification” (EMA/603905/2013). This design space verification and lifecycle 
management were based on a risk assessment of potential scale dependent phenomena for each step 
along with the control strategy demonstrated during development studies.  As a result, none of the 
design spaces were categorized as high risk but as medium scale-up risk. Thus, well-established 
chemical engineering science and scale-up principles (e.g. heat transfer, solids suspension, liquid 
blending) and correlations were used to examine potentially scale-dependent phenomena and confirm 
that they do not impact process performance, and that the design spaces developed at laboratory scale 
apply to (are verified for) commercial scale.  The consistency of commercial scale batches (15 batches) 
with lab scale predictions provided further support for the design space scale verification conclusions.  
Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The tezacaftor active substance control strategy comprises the starting materials, reagents and 
solvents specifications, the active substance synthesis design spaces, IPCs and active substance 
specification. The impurity data and justifications (including purge and fate studies) support the control 
strategy; absence of carry-over of impurities through the synthesis has sufficiently been demonstrated 
and the control strategy is in line with the guidelines (e.g. ICH Q3A, Q3C, M7, Q11).  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
Detailed information regarding the manufacturing process development of tezacaftor active substance 
has been presented.  The changes made during development are considered minor and are not 
expected to impact on the quality of the active substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

The active substance is packaged inside a LPDE bag and secured with an appropriate closure (twist tie 
or equivalent). The bag is then placed inside a second LDPE bag and secured appropriately; the closed 
LDPE bags are placed into a secondary container suitable for storage and shipping which complies with 
the European Guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials (CPMP/QWP/4359/03). The LDPE 
resin used to manufacture the bags is suitable to be in contact with food and complies with the 
requirements of Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and the Ph.Eur. Monograph 3.1.3 
“Polyolefins”. 
Specification 
Tezacaftor  specification  includes  tests  and  limits  for  appearance,  identification  (IR),  assay  (HPLC), 
organic impurities (HPLC), inorganic impurities: palladium (Ph. Eur.) and residue on ignition/ sulphated 
ash (Ph. Eur.) and, residual solvents (GC). 
The active substance specification is based on the active substance CQAs. The CQA identified are 
appearance, identification, assay, organic impurities, chiral purity, inorganic impurities, residual 
solvents, palladium and copper. A justification for the absence of control of chiral purity, copper, heavy 
metals, residual trimethylamine, water content, physical form, particle size and microbial count has 
been provided and is considered acceptable. 
Specifically, the absence for a control of chiral purity has been justified on the basis that tezacaftor 
contains a single chiral center, which is a secondary carbinol. The tezacaftor enantiomer, arises from 
an enantiomeric impurity in one of the starting materials. The downstream chemistry does not 
promote racemization of the stereocentre, and no racemization was observed during tezacaftor active 
substance stability studies. In order to accomplish racemization, a multi-step procedure with specific 
conditions would be required. Therefore, the control of chiral purity of tezacaftor active substance is 
established according to ICH Q6A (decision tree #5) by applying limits in the starting material as 
supported by development studies. The carry over studies and design spaces studies showed that the 
stereo-chemical enantiomers, if formed, do not carry through the synthesis and that the limit 
established at starting material level is adequate. This justification is acceptable. 
Elemental impurities are controlled in line with ICH Q3D. 
All solvents are control well below the option 1 limit in draft ICH Q3C (R6). 
Water content is not a CQA of tezacaftor because the crystalline active substance is non-hygroscopic , 
and water does not affect active substance stability or finished product manufacture. 
With regards to active substance polymorphism, physical form has been monitored during all 
development and stability studies. To date, there has been no change in the tezacaftor polymorphic 
form. In addition, the active substance fully dissolves in organic solvents at the beginning of the spray-
drying process. Form A is freely soluble at the maximum solids load in the spray drying solvent system 
For this reason, polymorphic form is not a CQA of the tezacaftor active substance and it is not included 
in its specification. 
Likewise, particle size of tezacaftor is not a CQA because the active substance is completely dissolved 
in the spray drying solvent system as the first step of the SDD manufacture. 
Tezacaftor has not been shown to be bactericidal or bacteriostatic. However, the active substance 
manufacturing process follows classic chemical synthesis which is hostile to microorganisms. In 
addition, the microbial limits and water activity test results from 3 representative active substance lots 
presented show very low bioburden, absence of specified microorganisms using validated compendial 
microbial limits methods, and water activities less than 0.6 (consistent with the fact that the active 
substance has low hygroscopicity and indicating the material is not likely to support microbial growth). 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 19/20 
 
 
 
 
The primary stability showed that water activity levels remain below the threshold for microbial growth 
promotion (0.6), and no change in microbial content after storage for 12 months at 25°C/60% RH in 
the intended container closure system. These combined data indicate that tezacaftor active substance 
possesses very low risk of microbial contamination and microbial testing of commercial lots is not 
necessary. 
The tests and limits in the specifications are considered appropriate for controlling the quality of this 
active substance. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
All batch results (including those of the batches used in the clinical studies) are in compliance with the 
proposed specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standard used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 21 pilot or commercial scale batches of the active substance used for non-
clinical studies, clinical studies, and formal stability studies, or intended for future clinical or 
commercial use were provided for the approval for Symkevi. In addition, data from 11 commercial 
scale batches manufactured using the revised manufacturing process have been provided in the MAA 
dossier for Kaftrio. All the results are within the proposed specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from one of the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, organic impurities, chiral purity (HPLC), 
water content (KF titration), physical form (XRPD), microbial limits (USP <61> and <62>), specified 
microorganisms (E. coli) and water activity (USP <1112>). All results met the acceptance criteria for 
the attributes evaluated and no trends were observed. Water activity levels remained below the 
threshold for microbial growth promotion (0.6), and no change in microbial content after storage for 24 
months at 25°C/60% RH in the intended container closure system was observed. The stability data 
show that tezacaftor active substance is stable when packaged in the intended container closure 
system under all storage conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B option 2 was performed on one batch. Samples 
were tested for appearance, assay, organic impurities and chiral purity. The data, showing no changes 
in the fully exposed test sample and the covered control, confirm that tezacaftor active substance is 
photostable and does not require light protective packaging.  
Results on stress studies including heat (80°C), heat/humidity (80°C/75%RH), treatment under acidic 
(0.2N HCl, ambient), basic (0.2N NaOH, ambient), and oxidative (0.02% H2O2, ambient) conditions for 
up to 14 days, and exposure to UV and visible light (solid and solution) were also provide on one 
batch. Tezacaftor was found to be the least stable under the oxidative condition and when exposed to 
light stress conditions in solution. Results from the primary stability studies demonstrate that none of 
the degradation products observed under these stress conditions are found at or above the reporting 
threshold when the active substance is packaged and stored according to label requirements. No 
degradation was observed when tezacaftor was exposed to the other stress conditions listed above.

All tezacaftor samples from this study were tested for spectral peak purity. The tezacaftor peak was 
found to be spectrally pure in all stressed samples demonstrating that the commercial HPLC method 
for assay and organic impurities determination of tezacaftor active substance is stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored in 
the proposed container at no more than 30°C. 
Elexacaftor 
General information 
The chemical name of elexacaftor (also known as VX-445) is N-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonyl)-
6-[3-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2,2-dimethylpropoxy)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-2-[(4S)-2,2,4-trimethylpyrrolidin-1-
yl]pyridine-3-carboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula C26H34F3N7O4S. It has a molecular 
weight of 597.66 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 3: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of elexacaftor was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, MS, NMR 
(1H and 13C), IR, Raman and UV-Vis. XRD, DSC, TGA and DVS were used to determine the physical 
characteristics of elexacaftor. 
Elexacaftor is a crystalline non-hygroscopic white solid. Elexacaftor is practically insoluble in water and 
buffer solutions from pH 1.0 to pH 8.0. It is also practically insoluble in fasted and fed states simulated 
intestinal fluid at room temperature and 37 ⁰C. 
Elexacaftor exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre (with S-configuration). 
The asymmetric centre is a saturated hydrocarbon with no proximal functionality, hence it does not 
support or stabilize a transition state to promote racemization. Additionally, enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC in one of the starting materials. This has been adequately justified 
in line with ICH Q6A (see specifications section).  
With regards to polymorphism the physical form of elexacaftor is the crystalline neat form.  
The screening conducted showed that VX-445 forms solvates with methanol, ethanol and isopropyl 
acetate. No hydrate was found to form in multiple aqueous based solvent systems. The physical form 
selected for elexacaftor is the thermodynamically stable form and stable during the proposed 
manufacturing process.

This active substance is synthesized in six chemical steps using four well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specificationswhich have been adequately justified in line with ICH Q11.    
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, DOE studies, and kinetic modelling. The materials and 
process for the manufacture of elexacaftor were assessed as part of the initial risk assessment. When 
the assessment indicated a medium or high risk, further experimentation and assessment on the 
Assessment report

effects of parameters on elexacaftor CQAs were conducted. Based on the results from these studies, 
the critical parameters for this process were defined and the design spaces were established. 
The scale dependent phenomena for steps with design space or a known scale-up risk for each step, 
have been discussed and considered acceptable. These included solids suspension, liquid blending and 
liquid-liquid dispersion. All were within the design space limits on a commercial scale; the QbD studies 
to define limits and assess criticality are deemed appropriate. , it is concluded that adequate 
methodology for design space scale verification has been used and confirm the adequacy of the 
proposed design spaces for commercial manufacture. The available development data, the proposed 
control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed 
design spaces. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. The 
relevant spike/purge experiments have been undertaken and adequate limits have been set for each 
impurity. 
In-silico analysis was performed and identified six compounds as potential or known genotoxic 
impurities. Risk assessments using purge factor calculations were performed demonstrating that these 
are eliminated by the process and justifying their control strategy. 
Elemental impurities are controlled to the ICH Q3D limit in intermediate specification and indirectly 
controlled via the specification for residue on ignition in the active substance.  
Solvents used early in the process are controlled according to ICH Q3C in the relevant intermediate 
specification after their last use. All solvents used in latter stages are controlled in the final active 
substance specification in line with ICH Q3C. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program.  The proposed commercial manufacturing process uses the same bond 
making and breaking steps as the original process. Changes included change of some reaction 
solvents, addition of water swashes, addition of some IPC and changes to the crystallization conditions, 
among others. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. It 
has been demonstrated that the change(s) did not have a significant impact on the quality of the 
product. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged inside a LPDE bag and secured with an appropriate closure (twist tie 
or  equivalent).  The  clear  translucent  bag  is  then  placed  inside  a  second  black  opaque  LDPE  bag  and 
secured appropriate. The closed LDPE bags are placed into a secondary container suitable for storage 
and shipping. The LDPE resin used to manufacture the bags is suitable to be in contact with food and 
complies with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and the Ph.Eur. Monograph 
3.1.3 “Polyolefins”.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (IR, Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), organic impurities (HPLC), residue on ignition/sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), residual solvents (GC), 
physical form (Ph. Eur.) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). These are the CQAs of 
elexacaftor.

The acceptance criteria for the specified enantiomeric impurity supported by atoxicology study (refer to 
non-clinical part). The acceptance criteria for other organic impurities have been in line with the ICH 
Q3A qualification threshold for active substances with a maximum daily dose of ≤2g.  
ICH Q3C option 1 limits are used for all solvents except for solvents where no ICH limits are provided. 
For solvents without ICH limits, limits were established as per ICH Q3C calculation for a 10g daily dose 
and literature PDE data of 6.2mg/day. 
Physical form is confirmed by IR spectroscopy. This is the thermodynamically stable form, which has 
been consistently manufactured. 
The particle size is controlled by the manufacturing process conditions and was measured throughout 
development by laser light diffraction. As requested by the CHMP the applicant tightened the 
specification limit and included a 3-tier limit in line with active substance particle size data for batches 
used in pivotal clinical trials along with ongoing clinical studies.  
The absence for a test for chiral purity has been justified based on the fact that it is controlled at the 
level of the starting material. Additionally, during the manufacturing process or storage the conditions 
needed for racemization do not occur. This strategy is supported by development studies and release 
and stability data. 
Aluminum is used as a reagent in the preparation of an intermediate. According to ICH Q3D, 
aluminium is considered to have low inherent toxicity and low risk to human health therefore it is not 
included in the specification and it is indirectly controlled through the residue on ignition specification 
in the intermediate and the active substance. Other elemental impurities used in the process are 
controlled to ICH Q3D limits. 
Water content has been omitted from the specification since it is not a critical quality attribute of 
elexacaftor, which is a crystalline non-hygroscopic active substance. 
The absence of specification for microbial purity has been justified by the low water activity <0.6 and 
the low bioburden results in four active substance stability batches. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurity testing has been presented. The method for assay 
and organic impurities by HPLC have been demonstrated to be stability indicating based on forced 
degradation studies 
Batch analysis data has been provided from multiple batches of the active substance used in non-
clinical, clinical and stability studies as well as four commercial size batches manufactured at the 
production site. All batches comply with specification including the additional quality attribute chiral 
purity which is not included in the specification. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale and one supportive pilot scale batches of active substance 
from the proposed manufacturer(s) stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months 
under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, organic impurities, chiral purity (HPLC), 
water content (KF titration), physical form (Ph. Eur.), microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC, E.coli) (Ph. Eur.), 
and water activity. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. The results indicate that the chiral purity and polymorphic form remain the same on

stability. All results remained well within the acceptance limits and no trends were observed. The  re-
test period is justified. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one pilot scale batch. Samples 
were tested for appearance, assay, organic impurities and chiral purity. Changes in appearance and 
unspecified impurities were observed in the exposed sample therefore the active substance has to be 
stored in light protective packaging (outer LDPE black bag) for long term storage.  
Elexacaftor was subjected to stress conditions including heat and heat/humidity for 21 days, treatment 
under acidic, basic and oxidative conditions for 7 days and exposure to UV and visible light. Samples 
were tested for assay and total impurities. Samples were most sensitive to acidic and oxidative 
conditions The results demonstrated that the methods for assay and organic impurities determination 
are stability indicating. 
Vertex has committed to monitoring the stability of the primary lot and one supportive lot of the active 
substance through 60 months under the protocol.  
Vertex has also committed to monitoring the stability of 3 commercial lots from the first commercial 
campaign of VX-445 from each site under the stability protocol and thereafter a minimum of 1 lot per 
year at each site according to the post approval stability protocol provided.  
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored in the 
proposed container in order to protect from light. The active substance does not need a specific 
storage temperature condition. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Kaftrio is an immediate-release film coated tablet for oral administration. The tablet is a fixed dose 
combination (FDC) of the active ingredients ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor. The 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor FDC tablets contain 75 mg of ivacaftor, 50 mg of tezacaftor, and 100 
mg of elexacaftor and have a total tablet target weight of 502.64 mg. They are orange film coated 
tablets, debossed with “T100” on one face and plain on the other face. 
The QbD strategy applied to the finished product is the same as that for Orkambi and Symkevi.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was to develop immediate release FDC tablets of 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (100mg/50mg/75mg) for oral administration, bioavailable, safe and 
efficacious and with at least 24-month shelf-life at room temperature in the proposed container. 
Potential CQAs for the elexacaftor substance, tezacaftor SDD, ivacaftor SDD and the FDC tablet were 
described. The CQAs for the FDC tablets are: appearance, identification, assay, degradation products, 
dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, physical form, residual solvents, microbial limits, elemental 
impurities and chiral purity. 
Upon CHMP request, the applicant has provided a justification regarding the acceptability of the dosage 
form and its physical properties to the intended patient population. 
Both ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances are provided as individual amorphous SDDs. 
Elexacaftor is provided as a crystalline powder. As indicated above, the applicant declared that 
ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances and SDDs used in this Kaftrio submission are identical to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 24/25 
 
 
 
ones used and approved for Kalydeco (ivacaftor), Orkambi (ivacaftor/lumacaftor) and Symkevi 
(ivacaftor/tezacaftor). 
Ivacaftor is a stable crystalline material of high purity with well characterized physical and chemical 
properties. While crystalline ivacaftor is chemically and physically stable, it practically insoluble in 
aqueous media and has low bioavailability. Various approaches to obtain materials with better aqueous 
solubility were explored including salts, co-crystals, and an amorphous form. Given the acceptable 
chemical and physical stability of the neat amorphous form combined with its significantly improved 
dissolution rate and bioavailability as compared to a crystalline form, the amorphous form was selected 
as the most appropriate active substance form for development. The physical stability of amorphous 
ivacaftor in aqueous systems is significantly improved when a molecular amorphous dispersion is 
formed with a stabilizing polymeric material. The crystalline active substance is therefore spray dried 
to make an amorphous SDD prior to manufacturing the final tablet. As mentioned above, this is the 
same approach used in the approved Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symkevi products.  
Ivacaftor is compatible with the processing solvents and excipients used in the SDD as confirmed by 
stability studies. 
Binary excipient compatibility studies were conducted with development ivacaftor SDD formulations 
mixed with common tableting excipients. These studies were conducted under open dish conditions at 
40°C/75%RH and showed no changes to the physical or chemical stability of ivacaftor with any of the 
excipients tested. In addition, no physical or chemical stability changes have been noted with any 
finished product lot on stability. 
Tezacaftor active substance is provided as a crystalline solid which is practically insoluble in water and 
buffer solutions from pH 1.0 to pH 9.0. The amorphous form of tezacaftor was selected as the most 
appropriate physical form for development due to increased solubility as compared to a crystalline 
form. The physical stability of amorphous tezacaftor in solution is significantly improved with the 
addition of a polymer to the amorphous dispersion. The crystalline active substance is therefore spray 
dried with a polymerto produce an amorphous SDD finished product intermediate. Tezacaftor SDD is 
packaged inside a LDPE bag/liner which is placed inside a second LDPE bag/liner. The closed LDPE 
bag/liners are then sealed in a foil laminated bag with desiccant. 
Elexacaftor active substance is the new active substance (NAS) component of the proposed FDC 
tablets. The clinically relevant physicochemical properties of this active substance were discussedAs 
indicated in the active substance section, the crystalline form is the most thermodynamically stable 
form and was selected for development. This form is stable during finished product manufacture.  
The applicant has not discussed rationale for the choice of excipients and their content in the finished 
product; however, it can be accepted that prior knowledge has been used to help define the qualitative 
and quantitative composition. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. Compliance with EU colouring in medicinal products 
regulation is confirmed for the colours. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report.The impact of critical material attributes (CMAs) has been discussed, and the applicant has 
confirmed that there are no expected impacts to product CQAs or process dynamics, material flow, 
diversion, or process performance when excipients are used within their respective specifications and 
defined by the product composition. 
Multiple lots of each excipient were used during development and clinical manufacture with no impact 
observed on processability or product quality due to lot-to-lot variation. This lack of observed impact is 
also supported through prior knowledge gained during the development, clinical, and commercial 
manufacturing experience with Symkevi and Orkambi, which share many of the same excipients.

As with Symkevi and Orkambi NIR final blend chemometric models, the Kaftrio FDC final blend NIR 
chemometric model calibration sets include spectra obtained throughout the design space using 
multiple lots of excipients. Models are robust against normal excipient lot to lot variability. 
The rationale supporting Avicel grades is presented and it is agreed that compendial specifications are 
sufficient, considering the degree of (parametric) control exerted by the equipment and the equipment 
configuration details registered. 
Compatibility was investigated by placing proposed Kaftrio FDC tablets on an open dish stability study 
at 40ºC/75%RH for 6 months. The results demonstrate the chemical and physical compatibility of all 
components of the FDC tablet. 
A summary of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivacaftor, and deuterated ivacaftor formulations used in clinical 
development, along with the trials they were used in has been provided. The final FDC formulation 
proposed for commercial use was evaluated in a bioavailability study (Study VX17-445-005) and dosed 
in Phase 3 studies.  
The FDC finished product was developed using a continuous manufacturing (CM) process on a 
Continuous Manufacturing Development and Launch Rig (DLR). The FDC tablet is manufactured using a 
dry granulation process  
Similarly to Orkambi and Symkevi, initial clinical supplies were manufactured using a discontinuous 
process, and both the discontinuous and continuous processes were used to manufacture material for 
pivotal clinical trials. Both tablets have the same composition and utilize the same manufacturing 
process (process steps), although one was made using a discontinuous process and the other the 
continuous process. Several of the unit operations utilize exactly the same equipment (roller 
compactor, press and film coater). The continuous blending process utilizes a different mechanism for 
blending compared to the discontinuous process, however both blending processes produce uniform 
blends, as demonstrated by blend uniformity testing, and result in comparable FDC finished product. 
The continuous process has been used for development and Phase 3 clinical resupply batches, formal 
stability batches, QbD DOE experiments, and is the proposed commercial process. 
The in-vitro dissolution methods for each active substance were independently developed. Extensive 
investigations were performed to ensure the methods were adequately discriminating. This included 
evaluation of actives solubility in various media (considering surfactant, buffer, pH, and paddle speed), 
selection of media that ensure sink conditions and show discrimination with respect to material/tablet 
attributes and processing parameters and selection of media that enable the selection of an 
appropriate reporting time point. The discriminatory power of each method was evaluated with respect 
to material attributes and tablet properties, including the active bulk density and crystallinity, excipient 
level, active particle size, ribbon solid fraction, granule particle size and tablet hardness. 
It is acknowledged that the methods for ivacaftor and tezacaftor are identical to those for already 
approved products. 
The dissolution methods have collectively shown discriminating ability against meaningful 
manufacturing and material attribute variations and are considered suitable for their intended use as 
primary release and stability quality control methods for the FDC tablets.  
The submitted dossier is the third CM dossier for the applicant. The CM process starts with the 
introduction of formulation components and ending with film coated tablets. The FDC product was 
developed using dry granulation on Vertex’s continuous manufacturing platform (DLR) already used for 
Orkambi and Symkevi manufacture.  
The DLR is controlled by a process control system responsible for user access control. The process 
control system displays active unit operations, the status of IPCs and CPPs, process trends, and alerts.

All principles of continuous manufacturing (from the stages feeding, materials handling, blending, dry 
granulation, milling, compression, and film-coating), material flow through the system and residence 
time distribution (RTD) have been described. 
The start-up and shut-down procedures as they cascade through the process have also been 
described.  
In the continuous process, material is tracked using the Product Key (PK) concept. It is explained that 
specific PKs having IPC results outside the acceptance criteria will be removed from the process. 
Segregation points have been presented and justified. The segregation approach has also been 
described taking into consideration the RTD and the equipment design.  
Specific aspects of the process have been discussed in more detail, including process and equipment 
design considerations, feedback loops, etc. Specific operational considerations have also been 
described. 
The CM process control strategy consists of four levels: unit operation control(s) to set point, design 
space monitoring, in-process controls and product specifications.  
The DLR is equipped with process analytical technology with some being used for in-process control 
(IPC),. Process parameters and design space limits are monitored in real-time, and any excursions are 
detected and alerted in real-time. In-process controls and limits are defined, as is the finished product 
specification.  
The primary mechanism by which the quality of the finished product is assured is parametric control.  
A key part of the control strategy is ‘typical final blend potency’ IPC method to control homogeneity 
and potency of the blend prior to compression.  
During the review a major objection on the ability of the NIR method to correctly categorise samples 
was raised. CAPAs have been implemented, and the initial risk assessment has been updated and 
mitigation steps implemented. The applicant confirmed that parallel testing has been performed and 
100% agreement between the HPLC results and NIR results was achieved for each of the models.  The 
applicant was requested and committed to perform it on all five batches in the next campaign.  It will 
be extended to additional five batches if any of the initial five do not meet the parallel testing 
acceptance criteria. 
The NIR model principles, development and validation, maintenance and life-cycle management are all 
discussed. A PACMP has been submitted to manage NIR model updates. The model is critical to 
product quality and is considered a high-impact model. The PACMP has been agreed. 
The IPC sampling plan is discussed and justified, and is driven primarily by parametric control; 
therefore, equipment and process design and operational considerations as well as input materials 
controls feature more prominently. 
Risk assessment, prior knowledge, and DOEs were subsequently used to design multivariate 
experiments that evaluate main effects and interactions on the CQAs. These experiments consider the 
desired manufacturing range (DMR) as well as incoming material specifications and equipment 
capability. Any differences in scale or equipment between the experiments conducted and the 
commercial equipment were considered (scale-up and engineering risk assessment) to ensure results 
are representative of the commercial process.  
Experimental designs were conducted in a multivariate manner for the granulation and compression 
unit operations. Separately, a unit-operation specific experiment was conducted for the film-coating 
process. Intragranular and extragranular blending speeds were fixed, based on initial risk assessment 
evaluation, and considered of low risk to the resulting finished product quality, on standard rotations.

The  primary  packaging  is  a  blister  consisting  of  PCTFE  (polychlorotrifluoroethylene)/PVC  (polyvinyl 
chloride)  with  a  paper  backed  aluminium  foil  lidding.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  tezacaftor  SDD  and  ivacaftor  SDD  is  the  same  as  for 
Symkevi and Kalydeco. 
Briefly, the preparation of the ivacaftor SDD consists of three steps: mixture preparation, spray drying 
and secondary drying, followed by packaging. 
The manufacture of the tezacaftor SDD is a multi- step process comprising solution preparation, spray 
drying, secondary drying and sieving and bulk packaging. 
A second PACMP to manage specific design spaces changes for the tezacaftor SDD spray-drying step 
resulting from equipment and/or site changes or modifications has been submitted. The protocol 
defines the experiments, testing, acceptance criteria, and regulatory reporting strategy based on the 
specific proposed change. This PACMP is identical to that included in Symkevi dossier. 
As mentioned above, Kaftrio FDC tablets are manufactured using a CM process. The process steps 
include feeding, blending, dry granulation and milling, compression, and coating. A fixed line rate has 
been defined and is used. During the review the CHMP raised a major objection since the level of detail 
of the manufacturing process description and control strategy was considered insufficient, taking into 
consideration the parametric control strategy and the findings during development. This was 
satisfactorily addressed by the applicant. Vertex has confirmed that all batches supplied to European 
markets will meet and be released to all specifications for incoming materials, starting materials, 
elexacaftor, and finished product agreed upon during review and reflected in the final dossier. 
As described in the previous section, the manufacturing process was developed in accordance with the 
enhanced approach in ICH Q8. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and 
batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space for 
compression and coating. The design space is specific to the equipment train and equipment 
configuration. 
A third PACMP to manage changes to the FDC tablets design space and sites of manufacture during the 
product lifecycle has been provided and is acceptable. 
Comprehensive information regarding process controls has been provided. The NIR method is a 
qualitative method, used to discriminate between samples inside and outside the limits. The limits 
reflectthe proposed finished product assay specification. The NIR acquisition method is adequately 
described and supported. The model justification is extensive and is intended to ensure that adequate 
variability is incorporated. The content uniformity method defined in the specification is used for 
reference analyses. Model validation considers ICH Q2 and the EU NIR Guidelines. The model is 
considered high impact, directly affecting product quality. 
The intended commercial batch size has been defined.   
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies.  
The manufacturing process is considered to be non-standard. A continuous process verification (CPV) 
approach as per the EMA Guideline on Process Validation for Finished Products–Information and Data to 
be  Provided  in  Regulatory  Submissions  (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1,  Corr.1)  has 
been followed. A CPV scheme is provided in 3.2.R.

It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution for the three active substances (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed release specifications are typical for an oral solid dose product and comply with ICH Q6A 
and P. Eur. Monograph for tablets.  
The applicant adopted a QbD approach to set specifications for the FDC finished product. Under this 
approach, specifications are not considered the primary means of control and are not solely based on 
historical data available. FDC tablet quality is achieved and assured by design of a well-controlled, 
robust manufacturing process. The tests included in the specification provide additional verification 
that specific CQAs have been met.  
The specified organic impurities in the FDC tablet are degradation of elexacaftor. The acceptance 
criterion for one of the specified impurities is supported by a toxicology study. The acceptance criterion 
for additional specified and unspecified degradation products are in line with ICH Q3B.  In addition, no 
other degradation products have been observed.  
Water content is determined at release only. Water content is not a CQA of the FDC tablets. However, 
an acceptance criterion at release ensures that the FDC tablets will have a water activity of not more 
than 0.6, and will therefore not support microbial growth. Water content is not monitored on stability 
since CQAs that could potentially be impacted, including microbial limits, are tested directly. 
The microbiological testing strategy for the FDC tablets follows the decision trees presented in ICH Q6A 
and the requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.1.4. The justification for not controlling microbial attributes on 
release is presented: this leverages cGMP controls, physicochemical properties of components and the 
final active substance, control of water content in the finished product and water activity 
determination, which together provide sufficient justification for the proposed approach. Microbial 
testing will be performed on commercial FDC tablet stability lots.  
Justifications are provided for the omission of the following: physical form, chiral purity, residual 
solvents and elemental impurities. 
The FDC tablets are comprised of crystalline elexacaftor, the most thermodynamically stable form, as 
well as amorphous tezacaftor and ivacaftor SDDs. Physical form for the FDC tablet is controlled via 
specifications on the incoming elexacaftor active substance, tezacaftor SDD, and ivacaftor SDD per ICH 
Q6A (decision tree #4). This is supported since it has been confirmed that physical form 
transformation does not occur within the manufacturing process design space nor on storage. All 
batches manufactured for clinical use as well as stability conform to the expected physical forms 
throughout storage. 
In addition, physical form stability was also evaluated during forced crystallization studies of the FDC 
tablet. The study results demonstrate that the long-term physical form stability of the actives is 
maintained at the intended storage conditions. 
The control of chiral purity of elexacaftor and tezacaftor have been established according to ICH Q6A 
(decision tree #5) by applying limits to the enantiomeric impurity in the stereogenic starting materials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 29/30 
 
 
 
In addition, it has been demonstrated that the stereochemical integrities of elexacaftor and tezacaftor 
are maintained, within method variability, throughout the FDC tablet manufacturing process. 
With regards to residual solvents, their levels are controlled via ICH Q3C (R7) option 1 limits for 
residual solvents used in the manufacturing of the elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor active 
substances, and ivacaftor and tezacaftor SDD. All SDD and tablet excipients also meet ICH Q3C (R7) 
Option 1 limits for residual solvents.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in FDC tablets was assessed according to the ICH Q3D 
(R1) using a risk-based approach and taking into account the dosing regimen. The risk assessment 
considered the potential contributions from the three active substances, the tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
SDDs (including solvents, reagents, excipients), water, tablet excipients, and manufacturing 
equipment. The elemental impurities intentionally added in the active substances manufacturing 
processes are controlled in the respective active substance to levels that ensure the FDC tablets 
conform to ICH Q3D (R1) requirements. 
The risk assessment of the content of Class 1/2A impurities in the active substances and SDDs, 
demonstrates that the risk of elemental impurities in these materials is low. Confirmatory testing of 
representative batches including nine elexacaftor active substance development batches, ten 
commercial tezacaftor active substance batches, eight commercial ivacaftor active substance batches, 
three commercial tezacaftor SDD batches, and four commercial ivacaftor SDD batches confirmed that 
the Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities is consistently below 30% of the ICH Q3D (R1) Option 1 
limits. The same was shown for all tablet excipients with the exception of Opadry Orange film coating 
system. For Opadry Orange, the Option 2b summation approach was employed to demonstrate that 
the maximum daily intake of each elemental impurity is well below 30% of its respective permitted 
daily exposure. 
Using the Option 1 and Option 2b approaches, it has been demonstrated that all Class 1/2A elemental 
impurities will be consistently below 30% of the established permitted daily exposures (PDEs). 
Confirmatory testing results on three representative development batches of FDC tablets were in 
alignment with the risk assessment. Therefore, no additional controls on elemental impurities in the 
finished product are required. 
Following a major objection from the CHMP, a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substances and finished product was provided. Based on EMA guidance, a risk 
evaluation has been performed for the presence of nitrosamines in the three active substances and the 
finished product including the packaging. The applicant has deemed there is no risk for nitrosamines 
with respect to the main conditions for nitrosamine formation. In relation to the synthesis of the 
elexacaftor active substance it is agreed with the applicant that in the synthesis a nitrosating agent is 
not present so there is no risk. The applicant has adequately explained the introduction of nitro group 
in the molecule of concern and justified that there is no risk of nitrosating agents being present in the 
starting material (. Therefore, it is concluded that there is no risk of nitrosamine formation in the 
product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH Q2(R1). Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for 
assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for two commercial scale and one pilot scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life and storage condition for the ivacaftor SDD is 24 months when stored in the 
intended container closure system. This is the same approved for Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symkevi, 
and the same data has been submitted in Kaftrio dossier. 
The proposed shelf life for tezacaftor SSD is 36 months when stored in the intended container closure 
system at not more than 30°C. This is the same approved for Symkevi, and the same data has been 
submitted in Kaftrio dossier. 
With regards to the stability of the FDC tablets, stability data from one pilot and two commercial scale 
batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and 
intermediate (30 ºC / 75% RH) conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Kaftrio are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  chiral  purity,  dissolution,  water 
content, physical form of all active substances (XRPD), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) and water activity (USP 
<1112>).  
The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  All  results  met  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the 
attributes evaluated. Although water content increased during real-time studies, it remained significantly 
below the proposed specification limit. All other parameters remained stable with either no change or 
changes attributable to method variability. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines4, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In  addition,  one  commercial  scale  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance, 
assay, degradation products and chiral purity. No changes were observed in the exposed tablet samples 
as  compared  to  the  covered  control,  confirming  that  FDC  tablets  do  not  require  light  protective 
packaging. 
Forced degradation studies were also conducted. FDC tablets were subjected to stress conditions, 
which included heat, heat/humidity, treatment under acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions, and 
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. The elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor peaks were 
found to be spectrally pure in all stressed samples demonstrating that the commercial HPLC methods 
for assay and degradation products determination of FDC tablets are stability indicating. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substances and the finished 
product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the 
manufacture of the active substances and finished product.   
Since ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances and SDDs are common components in Kalydeco 
(ivacaftor) tablets and granules (EMEA/H/C/002494), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) tablets 
(EMEA/H/C/003954) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) tablets (EMEA/H/C/004682), already approved 
in the EU, the same information on ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances and SDDs already 
registered has been presented for this product.  
This is the third CM application from the same applicant and the DLR equipment used for the 
manufacture of Kaftrio tablets is similar to that used for the manufacture of Orkambi and Symkevi 
tablets. However, the overall control strategy is significantly different in that the primary mechanism 
by which the quality of the product is assured is parametric control. This has been supported by 
pharmaceutical development studies and the design elements, manufacturing process description, 
process parameters, in-process controls and end-product testing specification described in the dossier. 
Three PACMP have been included in this dossier. One to manage NIR IPC model updated, and two to 
manage post approval changes to tezacaftor SDD and Kaftrio FDC tablets manufacturing process design 
spaces, respectively. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant is recommended and has committed to further perform parallel HPLC testing to 
demonstrate the NIR in-process control for final blend potency on all five batches in the next 
campaign. It will be extended to additional five batches if any of the initial five do not meet the 
parallel testing acceptance criteria. The Rapporteur should be informed if any criteria are not met 
during the parallel/confirmatory testing agreed to. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant applied for a marketing authorization for the combination of CFTR modulators 
elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor (Kaftrio). Two correctors (elexacaftor and tezacaftor) are 
combined with a potentiator (ivacaftor) to facilitate the processing of mutant CFTR forms (correctors) 
and support of the chloride transport function of the mutant CFTR (potentiator) upon arrival at the 
plasma membrane.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
There is no validated animal model for CF that fully mimics the human multi organ affected disease. 
Furthermore, the proposed treatment is specific for mutated CFTR proteins. All three components bind 
specifically to CFTR aiming at increasing the levels of mutated CFTR on the cell membrane and 
improving its channel gating functionality when present at the plasma membrane. Therefore, the use 
of in vitro systems has been proposed to study the pharmacology of elexacaftor alone or in 
combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.   
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant chose to use Primary Human Bronchial Epithelial (HBE) cells, isolated from the upper and 
lower bronchi of CF patient, that can be cultured for 90 days, as an in vitro model system. Primary 
cultures of fully differentiated HBE from CF lung explants exhibit many of the morphological and 
functional characteristics observed in CF airway epithelia in vivo, including the presence of ciliated and 
mucus-secreting cells, reduced salt and fluid transport, impaired cilia beating, and the formation of a 
thick mucus layer. As the ion channel activity and cellular function of primary CF HBE cultures are 
similar to in vivo airway tissue and as HBE cells from CF patients with a mutant CFTR expresses many 
characteristics associated with CF pathogenesis, including defective ion and fluid transport, the primary 
HBE cells of CF patients with known CFTR mutations can be regarded as relevant model system to 
study the pharmacological action of CFTR modulators. 
The applicant included a graphical comparison of the amount of chloride transport in HBE cells 
expressing wildtype or a mutated CFTR variant and clinical parameters such as Δ (change in) Sweat 
Chloride and ppFEV1 in healthy subjects or patients expressing mutated CFTR variant. The plot may 
suggest translatability of the in vitro results towards the clinical setting however, underlying data is 
lacking.  
For the in vitro studies, the applicant used two groups of HBE cells to study the effect of elexacaftor on 
top of tezacaftor and or ivacaftor. One group consisted of HBE cells from three different donors all 
harbouring two F508del alleles (F/F group). The other group consisted of HBE cells from four donors, 
all harbouring one F508del allele and one allele with a minimal function (MF) mutation (F/MF group). 
Among these four F/MF donors; two donors harbour a G542X mutation, one donor harbours a 
3905insT mutation and one donor harbours an E585X mutation.  
In vitro binding specificity of elexacaftor and/or tezacaftor to CFTR 
A saturation binding experiment using a thermostabilized variant of CFTR (TS-CFTR) reconstituted into 
a nanodisc was used to measure specific binding of elexacaftor and tezacaftor by Mass Spectrometry. 
Also, the effect of specific binding of elexacaftor to TS-CFTR upon addition of tezacaftor and vice versa 
was analysed to support the hypothesis that elexacaftor and tezacaftor bind TS-CFTR at different sites. 
The apparent Kd of elexacaftor is 72 ± 47 nM and of tezacaftor is 127 ± 59 nM for dissociation from 
CFTR-TS. The addition of tezacaftor at 500 nM did not change the apparent Kd of elexacaftor and the 
amount of bound tezacaftor remained unchanged when increasing concentrations of elexacaftor were 
added.  
These results support the conclusion that both molecules bind simultaneously to TS-CFTR. These 
observations show that both molecules bind to different, non-competing binding sites on TS-CFTR. 
Protein binding studies with elexacaftor to F508del-CFTR protein is technically not feasible as this form 
is less stable and would not result in sufficient purified protein. 
The synergistic effect of tezacaftor and elexcaftor in the chloride increase assay on double F508del 
mutants however suggested that both compounds bind also the F508del mutant CFTR on a different 
Assessment report

region (e.g. do not compete for binding). Elexacaftor binds to both MSD1 and MSD2, which is different 
to tezacaftor, which binds MSD1 only.  
Effect of the extra corrector (elexacaftor) on the processing of mutant CFTR in HBE cells 
According to the applicant, elexacaftor is a CFTR corrector. It implies that elexacaftor can help to 
improve the folding process and subsequently escape to the plasma membrane of CFTR mutants that 
are not efficiently and/or correctly folded in the Endoplasmatic reticulum. To investigate the effect of 
elexacaftor on top of tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor, the applicant analysed on western blot the amount of 
CFTR and glycosylated CFTR (that has travelled through the Golgi) upon incubation of the cells with 
elexacaftor all or not in combination with tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor. 
The results showed that elexacaftor incubation of the cells results in an increase of glycosylated CFTR 
compared to untreated, tezacaftor treated and ivacaftor treated cells. Treatment with tezacaftor and 
elexacaftor resulted in a synergistic effect. This effect seems to be dampened by the co-incubation with 
ivacaftor, but the potentiator ivacaftor is very likely needed to improve the function of the channels 
that have reached the membrane. Overall, the incubation with the combination of the three active 
compounds resulted in a higher increase in glycosylated mutant CFTR as compared to incubation with 
one corrector and one potentiator, thus with tezacaftor and ivacaftor or elexacaftor and ivacaftor.  
Effect of the extra corrector (elexacaftor) on chloride transport by mutant CFTR in HBE cells 
In addition to the effect on the processing, the effect on chloride transport of elexacaftor alone or in 
combination with tezacaftor and or ivacaftor was tested in F/F HBE cells or F/MF HBE cells. The plots 
consisted of data pooled per group, thus the F/F CFTR mutants together and the F/MF CFTR mutants 
together. In the report itself the data was also presented separately for each different donor. The 
results of this chloride transport assay showed better results for the triple combination than the 
combination of elexacaftor with either tezacaftor or ivacaftor alone or tezacaftor with ivacaftor when 
compared per donor. Thus, addition of elexacaftor yielded for HBE cells from all donors a relative 
increase in chloride transport.   
Variation in the results was observed for the F/F group but an even larger variation was seen in the 
F/MF group. The variation in the F/F group may point towards the fact that CF is a multifactorial 
disease and that other genetic factors than the CFTR variant underlying the disease and may play a 
role in the response to treatment. The more pronounced variation in the F/MF group rather suggests 
that MF CFTR mutants are responding differently to the treatment and that MF mutants cannot be 
regarded as non-functional mutants or not responding to the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. ln 
addition, cells of one of the F/MF donors showed a similar increase in chloride transport compared to 
cells of the best performing F/F donor suggesting that in this donor the MF CFTR contributes to the 
final result in an increase of chloride transport.  
Effect of the extra corrector (elexacaftor) on channel gating in FRT cells expressing F508del CFTR 
Single-channel, patch-clamp electrophysiology is an established laboratory technique to measure ion 
channel gating activity. 
Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing one allele of the F508del CFTR mutant were pre-incubated 
with elexacaftor or elexacaftor / tezacaftor. Baseline channel gating activity was determined. 
Afterwards, an acute stimulus with elexacaftor & elexacaftor plus ivacaftor or elexacaftor / tezacaftor & 
elexacaftor / tezacaftor plus ivacaftor were given. After spiking with the corrector(s) alone, channel 
opening was only very minimal. After spiking with the corrector(s) and the potentiator channel opening 
was achieved efficiently, supporting the use of ivacaftor in the triple combination.

In addition, it is noted that VX-445 and TEZ appear to work in an additive way based on results from 
the processing and trafficking and chloride transport assays; while the patch clamp assay suggests no 
additive effect of tezacaftor on top of elexacaftor with respect to channel gating. Although a necessary 
presence of both correctors is not directly clear from the patch clamp study, requirement for two 
correctors is justified by studies presented by the applicant. Furthermore, different concentrations of 
TEZ and VX-445 were used in the FRT cells and similar results were observed for VX-445 with and 
without TEZ. Prior to assessing gating activity, the cells were incubated with 1 μM VX-445 and 3μM 
TEZ in the presence of 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). It would be assumed that considering the high 
protein binding of VX-445 and TEZ, nonspecific binding to serum proteins would occur, thereby 
reducing the effective concentration of the compounds. The applicant clarified that 25% human serum 
(HS) was used in the chloride transport study and 10% FBS was used in the channel gating study 
explaining the 2.5-fold difference in the used concentration of elexacaftor and tezacaftor in the two 
experiments. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A-specific action of VX-445 on other mutated proteins sharing similar trafficking pathways as CFTR 
(G601S-hERG), sharing the same CFTR superfamily(G268V-Pgp), being endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-
arrested misfolded proteins (zAAT and N370S-β-glucosidase), or being unrelated misfolded proteins 
presenting nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates (mHTT Q145) was not observed. These results suggest 
that VX-445 is a selective corrector for CFTR as compared to other misfolded protein classes. 
The IC50 of elexacaftor for CysLT1 receptor antagonism is 0.71 μM in a protein free condition; this 
value is 7-fold higher than the clinical Cmax (14.5 μM total or 101 nM protein free) suggesting a 
minimal risk to human safety. 
Thus, elexacaftor poses only a minimal risk to human safety from potential VX-445 interaction with 
this receptor or other secondary, non-CFTR targets.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In in vivo safety pharmacology studies, the effects of elexacaftor on the central nervous system (CNS) 
and the respiratory system were assessed upon single dosing in the female rat. Up to a dose of 30 
mg/kg no effects on neurobehavioral endpoints, unscheduled deaths, clinical observations, or 
respiratory effects were observed, making 30 mg/kg the NOAEL for CNS and respiratory effects.  
Effects of elexacaftor on the cardiovascular system were assessed in telemetered dogs. A single dose 
of elexacaftor up to a nominal dose of 30 mg/kg (24.78 mg/kg actually measured) did not result in any 
changes in body temperature, blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate, or ECGs. Therefore, the 
NOEL for cardiovascular effects was determined to be 24.78 mg/kg. 
In vivo safety pharmacology for tezacaftor and ivacaftor was addressed in studies that were submitted 
with the previous MAA procedures for Kalydeco and Symkevi. Results suggested a low potential for 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor to elicit effects on CNS, respiratory or cardiovascular parameters at clinically 
relevant exposures. Effects on the gastro-intestinal (GI) system were limited to ivacaftor at higher 
doses (≥ 500 mg/kg), did not result in any GI motility dysfunction at lower doses in chronic rat and 
dog repeat-dose toxicity studies and were considered not relevant at therapeutic doses in humans. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies are submitted. This can be agreed since all 
components of Kaftrio are very specific for CFTR and it is not anticipated that Kaftrio will be

Page 35/36 
 
 
 
administered with another therapy directly affecting CFTR. The interaction with the three components 
of Kaftrio has been assessed in the in vitro pharmacology studies. Ivacaftor may interfere slightly with 
the increase of mature CFTR levels due to tezacaftor and elexacaftor incubation, however this would 
have minimal impact and is acceptable considering the need to add ivacaftor in order to open the 
chloride channels.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of VX-445 were investigated in a series of in vitro and in vivo 
studies. The PK properties of tezacaftor, ivacaftor and the combination tezacaftor/ivacaftor were 
previously assessed in the registration programs for Symkevi and Kalydeco respectively and results are 
discussed where relevant for the triple combination. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods for the quantitation of VX-445 and the pharmacologically active metabolite 
M23-445 in rat, mouse and dog plasma and VX-445 in rabbit plasma were validated in GLP studies.  
The validation results showed that the method for the quantitative determination of VX-455 in 
cynomolgus monkey plasma by HPLC followed by MS/MS detection VX-445 in plasma of monkeys has 
been sufficiently validated.  
The metabolite M23-445 in cynomolgus monkey plasma has been measured only as part of the in-vitro 
binding study to plasma proteins, showing by LC-MS/MS analysis that VX-445 and M23-445 protein 
binding was high (≥99%) in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human plasma and that both compounds 
bound mainly to human serum album. The LC-MS/MS analysis method used to measure M23-445 in 
protein binding assays in monkey plasma has been described with sufficient detail in the study report. 
The analytical methods for the determination of tezacaftor, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, ivacaftor, M1-IVA and 
M6-IVA in plasma of the nonclinical species were validated to support the registration of 
Symdeko/Symkevi and Kalydeco and remain unchanged. 
Permeability and transport 
VX-445  
VX-445 showed high permeability in a Caco-2 cell monolayer assay. The apparent permeability values 
at 5 μM were 3.08 x 10-6 cm/sec and 1.41 x 10-6 cm/sec for A>B and B>A assays, respectively. Using 
MDCK cells overexpressing human MDR1, it was shown that VX-445 is a substrate for Pg-P at 1 µM. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
TEZ and IVA showed high permeability in Caco-2 cells. The apparent permeability values at 5 µM were 
3.37 x 10-6 cm/sec (TEZ) and 11.9 x 10-6 cm/sec (IVA) for the A>B assays and 1.9 x 10-6 cm/sec 
(TEZ) 36.1 x1 10-6 (IVA) cm/sec for the B>A assays. In the MDCK-MDR1 assay, TEZ was shown to be 
a substrate P-gp, but IVA not. 
Single dose pharmacokinetics 
VX-445 
VX-445 showed good oral bioavailability in rats (84%), dogs (88%) and monkeys (68%). In the 
therapeutic dose range, the exposure increased as the dose increased. At higher doses, the increase in 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 36/37 
 
 
 
exposure increased in a less than dose proportional manner. Sex difference was observed for VX-445 
in rats (exposure in female > male), but not in dogs. 
There was no apparent food effect following oral administration of VX-445 to fed and fasted beagle 
dogs at 10 mg/kg. The volume of distribution was 0.32 L/kg in mice, 0.62 L/kg in rats, 0.28 L/kg in 
dogs and 0.30 L/kg in monkeys. These values are lower than the total body water (0.5-0.7L/kg). 
VX-445 showed a low plasma clearance. Values ranged from 0.22 mL/min/kg (dog) up to 
1.05 mL/min/kg (mouse), 1.48 mL/min/kg (monkey) and 1.55 mL/min/kg (rats). These values 
correspond with values less than 1%, 3.8% and 5% of the hepatic blood flow in dogs, monkeys and 
rats, respectively. The values for half-life ranged from 3.1 h in mice, 4.4 up to 4.9 h in rats, 2.8 up to 
3.7 h in monkeys up to 12.3 h in dogs. 
The bioavailability of VX-445 in human was about 34% in the fasted state and about 80% following 
administration with food (Study 001, see clinical AR). The volume of distribution was 53.7 L (~ 1 
L/kg), clearance was 1.18 L/h (~0.5 mL/min/kg) and half- life was 24 h. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
The bioavailability of tezacaftor ranged from ~40% to ~50% (rat, dog). The absorption of tezacaftor 
may be improved by the intake of food. Food increased absorption, as determined in dog studies. The 
volume of distribution ranged from 0.48-0.66 L/kg (dog, monkey) up to 1.6-1.9 L/kg (mouse, rat). The 
systemic clearance was lower than hepatic blood flow (mouse, rat, dog, monkey). 
The bioavailability of ivacaftor ranged from ~30% to ~60% (mouse, rat, dog). Food improved the 
absorption at high dose levels, whereas it was similar at lower dosages in suspension formulation. 
The volume of distribution ranged from 0.72 L/kg (dog) up to 2.2 L/kg (monkey), 2.7 L/kg (mouse) 
and 3.3-3.9 L/kg (rat). Systemic clearance following intravenous administration was lower than hepatic 
blood flow (mouse, rat, dog, monkey). 
Repeated dose pharmacokinetics 
VX-445 
Repeated dose PK of VX-445 was investigated in mice (28 days, 26 weeks), rats (7 days, 28 days, 26 
weeks), dogs (7 days, 28 days, 39 weeks), pregnant rats (GD 6 to 17) and pregnant rabbits (GD 7 to 
20). 
In mice, the exposure to VX-445 (AUC, Cmax) increased with dose in an approximately dose proportional 
manner, whereas the exposure to the major metabolite M23-445 (AUC, Cmax) increased more than dose 
proportional. Some accumulation was observed. In the 6-month study, VX-445 exposures on Day 182 
were 1.3 to 1.8-fold higher and the M23-445 exposure was 1.25 to 3.43-fold higher than on Day 1 across 
all doses. There were no consistent differences in exposure between males and females. 
In rats, systemic exposure (AUC, Cmax) increased with increasing dose in an approximately dose-
proportional manner in males and in an approximately dose-proportional or greater than the dose-
proportional manner in females. In the 6-month study, accumulation (AUC, Cmax) ratios increased 1.5 
to 4-fold with dose and time from Day 14 to Day 180 in females. Accumulation ratios for males 
generally did not change with dose and appeared to increase 1.5 to 4-fold with time from Day 14 to 
Day 180. The exposures (AUC, Cmax) to the metabolite M23-445 was up to 25-fold lower in males and 
up to 15-fold lower in females as compared to the exposures to VX-445 at these time points. 
In dogs, the exposure values for VX-445 (AUC, Cmax) increased with increasing dose in dose-
proportional to greater than dose-proportional manner. In the 39-week study, VX-445 showed a 3-to 
7-fold accumulation for AUC and a 3- to 5-fold accumulation was observed for Cmax. The accumulation

ratios did not appear to change with increasing dose. The exposure values for M23-445 (AUC, Cmax) 
increased with increasing dose in a greater than dose-proportional manner but remained low as 
compared to the exposures for VX-445. Relevant differences between males and females were not 
observed. 
Toxicokinetic evaluations in pregnant rats on GD 6 and GD 17 and in rabbits on GD 7 to GD 20 
revealed no new findings. Exposures to VX-445 (AUC, Cmax) increased dose proportional or slightly 
more than dose proportional and increased with time.  
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
The non-clinical PK of tezacaftor and ivacaftor after repeated administration are known. Tezacaftor 
showed no apparent accumulation of tezacaftor in mice, rats and dogs. Ivacaftor showed some 
accumulation in plasma at the higher dose levels in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. 
VX-445 combined with tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Several combination studies of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor were conducted, including a 7-day 
study, a 28-day study, and a 13-week study in rats, and a 28-day study in dogs. These studies were 
performed with VX-445 alone, or as a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, or in 
combination with tezacaftor or ivacaftor as a dual combination. 
In these studies, the systemic exposures (AUC and Cmax) to VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor were 
generally similar to the exposures observed when these compounds were dosed individually. The 
exposure of VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor generally increased as the dose increased. For VX-445, 
the increase in exposure was generally dose proportional or slightly more than dose proportional. For 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor, the increase in exposure was dose proportional at lower dose levels and was 
less than dose proportional at higher dose levels. Sex difference in pharmacokinetics was observed for 
VX-445 in rats (exposure in female > male), but not in dogs. No relevant differences (<2-fold) 
between males and females were observed for either tezacaftor or ivacaftor in rats or dogs. 
Plasma protein binding 
VX-445 
Binding of VX-445 and its metabolite M23-445 to plasma proteins is high (>99%) in mouse, rat, dog, 
monkey and human plasma. At the tested concentration of 3.3 µM, human albumin was the major 
protein for binding, whereas the binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein was minimal. The high degree of 
protein binding suggests that variation in albumin concentrations associated with age or disease may 
have minimal impact on the clinical pharmacokinetics of VX-445. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Tezacaftor binds for more than 98% to protein in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma. Human serum 
albumin was the main component involved in the binding in human plasma, whereas alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein played a minimal role. The metabolites M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ also highly bound to 
plasma proteins and similar across species (>97.5%), except M2-TEZ which is less protein bound in 
mouse plasma (93.6%). 
Plasma protein binding of ivacaftor and its major metabolites (M1-IVA and M6-IVA) was greater than 
98% in vitro in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma. Protein binding of ivacaftor to human plasma 
components, human serum albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and human gamma globulin, was and 
to most proteins in human plasma components. Human serum albumin was the main plasma 
component involved in the binding of ivacaftor or its metabolites in human plasma.

Distribution to red blood cells 
VX-445 
VX-445 did not preferentially distribute into red-blood cells. In humans orally administered 200 mg VX-
445, the average blood to plasma concentration ratio of radioactivity ranged from 0.581 to 0.723.  
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor showed no preferential partition into red-blood cells.  
Tissue distribution 
VX-445 
The tissue distribution of VX-445 was studied in rats. Quantitative whole body autoradiography showed 
that orally administered 14C-VX-445 was widely distributed throughout the body with the majority of 
tissues showing the highest concentrations at 4 h post-dose. The highest exposures were measured in 
the liver, bile tract and contents of the gastrointestinal tract. Lower exposures were observed in the 
mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, adrenals, pancreas, heart, kidneys, harderian gland, lachrymal 
glands and salivary glands. VX-445-related radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier, but measured 
concentrations in the brain were about 3-fold lower relative to plasma.  
A tissue distribution study in Long-Evans rats showed no significant distribution to melanin-containing 
tissues (skin, eyes), indicating that VX-445 did not preferentially associate with melanin.  VX-445 
distributes to the respiratory tract during the first 6 hours. 
In a tissue distribution study with non-radiolabelled VX-445, tissue concentrations of VX-445 were 
determined from brain, lung, heart, kidney, liver, and plasma at Tmax (4-6 h). The mean tissue to 
plasma concentration ratios were 0.185-0.219 in the brain, 0.421-0.505 in the lung, 0.971-1.13 in 
heart, and 1.04-1.37 in the kidney. The liver to plasma concentration ratios (2.9-5.3) for all doses was 
higher than the other tissues. 
The exposure of the male reproductive organs was about 2-fold lower relative to plasma, whereas the 
exposure of the female reproductive organs was in the same range.  
The distribution in pregnant animals was not significantly different from non-pregnant animals. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Tezacaftor is rapidly distributed across all tissues in rats, with detectable amounts noted in all tissues 
at 1 hour post dose. The gastrointestinal tract and liver showed the highest levels. Ivacaftor is rapidly 
distributed across all tissues in rats.  
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor also distribute to the respiratory tract. For tezacaftor, at Tmax (2-8 h), the 
exposure of the lung was 2.5-fold greater than the exposure in plasma, indicating that the retention of 
M1-TEZ was somewhat higher than of tezacaftor in lung tissue and plasma. For ivacaftor, at 4 h after 
oral administration, the ratio of the exposure in the lung was 3.8-fold greater than in plasma. 
Placental transfer and excretion in milk 
VX-445 
A 14C radiolabel study in pregnant rats showed that after a single oral dose of 10 mg VX-445 at GD 13 
and GD 18 small amounts of VX-445-related material passes the placenta and reaches the foetus. At 
these time points, at the Tmax of 8 h, the exposure of the foetus was 0.5–fold (at GD 13) and 0.7-fold 
(at GD 18) lower, relative to the exposure of blood.  
In lactating rats, the exposure of VX-445 in milk at LD 6-10 was approximately 43% of the exposure in 
plasma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 39/40 
 
 
 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
14C radiolabel studies showed that placental transfer of tezacaftor in rats and ivacaftor in rats and rabbits 
was minimal and the exposures in foetuses were low. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor are also excreted in the milk of lactating rats. The exposure to tezacaftor in 
milk was up to 3-fold greater and the exposure to ivacaftor was about 1.5-fold greater as compared to 
the exposures in plasma. 
Metabolism 
VX-445 
VX-445 is primarily metabolized by oxidation, mediated by CYP3A4- and CYP3A5. 
Metabolite profiling of VX-445 was performed in vitro (rat, dog, monkey and human liver 
microsomes/hepatocytes) and in vivo in rats, dogs and monkeys.  
The in-vitro metabolite profiles were qualitatively similar across rat, dog, monkey and human. No 
human-specific metabolites were observed. 
In hepatocytes and microsomes, the metabolites were M14 (pyrrolidine methyl oxidation), M15 (left 
hand side methyl oxidation), M22 (pyrazole methyl oxidation), M23 (pyrazole N-demethylation) and 
M24 (pyrrolidine cyclization) in microsomes, and M25 (amide hydrolysis and cyclization with the 
pyrrolidine) in hepatocytes. 
Metabolite profiles from plasma samples of rat, dog, and monkey were qualitatively and quantitatively 
similar. The major observed metabolites were M15 (left hand side methyl oxidation), M23 (pyrazole N-
demethylation, and M25. M22 (pyrazole methyl oxidation) was also observed. 
In rats, VX-445 accounted for the majority (86.7%) of the total exposure to VX-445 and related 
material in plasma, followed by M15 (6.2%), M23 (4.1%) and M25 (1.7%), and unknown 16 (1.3%) in 
decreasing order of abundance. None of the metabolites alone accounted for more than 10% of total 
circulating radioactivity, indicating that none of these metabolites is considered a major metabolite in 
rats. 
In human, VX-445 accounted for 80.7% of the total exposure to VX-445 and related material in 
plasma, followed by M23 (17.3%), M25 (1.6%) and unknown (0.4%). M23-445 is a major metabolite 
in humans. 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the predominant cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of 
tezacaftor, M1-TEZ, ivacaftor and M1-IVA. 
Excretion 
VX-445 
Metabolism followed by biliary excretion of metabolites was the primary route of elimination for VX-445 
in rats and dogs, and likely in humans. 
The excretion balance of in bile duct cannulated rats and humans showed that the main route of 
excretion occurs via the faeces (82% in rats and 87.3% in human), whereas the excretion in urine 
plays a minor role (0.63% in rats and 0.23% in human).  
In bile-duct cannulated rats, 20.18%, 61.87%, and 0.63% of the oral administrated dose was found in 
faeces, bile, and urine, respectively up to 72 hours. When dosed IV in the rats, there was 8.67% of the 
dose was recovered in faeces, potentially through intestinal secretion. This suggests that enterohepatic 
circulation plays a minor role. 
Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor 
Tezacaftor is mainly excreted into the faeces in rats (75-79%), dogs (58%) and humans (72%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 40/41 
 
 
 
The major part of faecal excretion was due to excretion via the bile in rats (53%) and dogs (50%). 
Excretion via the urine was low in rats and dogs (< 10%) and humans (14%). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A comprehensive non-clinical package was submitted to evaluate the safety of elexacaftor. The rat was 
the pivotal rodent species in repeat dose toxicity studies with elexacaftor alone or in combination with 
tezacaftor or ivacaftor. The dog was the pivotal non-rodent species. One combined 5-day and 28-day 
repeat dose toxicity study with elexacaftor was conducted in mice. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Studies in mice 
Doses beyond 150 mg/kg/day with elexacaftor were poorly tolerated requiring the early termination of 
all animals included in these groups. A cause of death could not be attributed. At doses of 100 
mg/kg/day the only notable elexacaftor related changes were an increase in total protein, albumin and 
globulin. In the absence of any correlates, these changes are considered not toxicologically relevant 
and the NOAEL in this study is 100 mg/kg/day. At this dose, animals were exposed to 27-fold of the 
intended clinical exposure. 
Studies in rats with elexacaftor alone 
Clear gender exposure differences were identified in rats, where plasma AUC was supra dose 
proportionally increased in females. Therefore, in the pivotal 4-week and 26-week study, female 
animals received approximately half the dose that males did.  
In a 28 day repeat dose toxicity study in rats, only minimal changes were observed. The most notable 
change was a small decrease in body weight gain in all groups, but the body weight gain decrease was 
only significant in the high dose male group. Terminal body weight remained lower compared to 
control animals even though animals receiving elexacaftor continued to steadily gain weight. 
Reticulocytes were reduced in males receiving elexacaftor 25mg/kg/day onwards and cholesterol was 
reduced in males and females in the highest dose group (50mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day, 
respectively). Reticulocytes were still slightly reduced in males receiving 50mg/kg/day elexacaftor and 
cholesterol remained reduced in this group. In the absence of correlating findings and the modest 
severity grade of the changes, these findings are not considered to be toxicologically relevant. The 
NOAEL in the 28 day repeat dose toxicity study in rats was the highest dose tested: 30mg/kg/day in 
females and 50 mg/kg/day in males. It represents 3-and 2-fold clinical exposure multiples. 
In the pivotal long term (26 week) repeat dose toxicity study, all animals at 75 mg/kg/day (m) and 30 
mg/kg/day (f) were terminated early (d26) due to moribundity and rapidly declining condition, which 
was preceded by decreased food consumption, severe body weight loss and one or more of the 
following observations: thin body condition, hunched posture, loss of skin elasticity, skin cold to touch, 
material around nose, and/or piloerection. The cause of death/moribund condition in most of these 
animals was erosion of the glandular mucosa of the stomach, some of which were visible as brown or 
black foci in the stomach at necropsy.  
Among animals that survived to scheduled necropsy after 26 weeks of dosing, there were no notable 
changes in clinical or anatomic pathology results. Minor elexacaftor-related decreases in red blood cells 
(RBC), HGB and HCT at 40 mg/kg/day were noted which were not toxicologically relevant. There were 
no test article-related effects on urinalysis/urine chemistry parameters or ophthalmoscopic 
examinations. Total bilirubin was increased in males from 15 mg/kg/day onward and in females given 
15 mg/kg/day (with a trend to increase in females given 7.5mg/kg/d). ALT was increased in males at 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 41/42 
 
 
 
40 mg/kg/day, likely due to stress and/or reduced food intake since triglycerides and cholesterol levels 
were somewhat decreased in males and females (40 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively).  
There were no elexacaftor related findings in gross pathology. Histopathological changes included 
moderate erosion of the stomach in 1 male and minimal erosion in 1 female at 40 mg/kg/day and 15  
mg/kg/day, respectively. Minimal to marked degeneration of seminiferous tubules was noted in 
40mg/kg/day males and correlated with minimal to severe aspermia. In females, mild to moderate 
increases in corpora lutea were noted in animals given 7.5mg/kg/day elexacaftor onwards. None of the 
observed changes were still present in the interim recovery animals. In conclusion, once daily oral 
gavage dosing of elexacaftor to rats for up to 26 weeks was tolerated at dose levels of 15 mg/kg/day 
in males and females, which is also the NOAEL. This represents a 4-fold and 13-fold clinical exposure 
multiple, respectively.  
Differences seen in the toxicology studies are attributed to the pharmaceutical form of elexacaftor (i.e. 
jet milled vs non-jet milled, where jet milled elexacaftor improves systemic exposure). Body weight 
changes are primarily attributed to tezacaftor and more importantly were not seen in the clinical 
setting. Weight gain in rats is an indicator of general well-being, the clinical relevance of decreased 
weight gain is not anticipated to manifest directly in weight loss in the clinical population and may 
indicate uncharacterised behavioural and/or metabolic change in these animals. It is accepted this is 
not a new finding, as noted, decreased weight gain has been observed in studies assessing the toxicity 
of TEZ and VX-445 administered alone. Furthermore, it is accepted that further mechanistic studies 
examining this finding are not warranted. 
Studies in dogs with elexacaftor 
With the exception of effects on male reproductive organs and correlating clinical observations 
(decreased food consumption, thin appearance), none of the adverse findings seen in rats were 
observed in dogs. In dogs receiving up to 30 mg/kg/day for up to one month, no adverse changes in 
clinical observations, body weight, and food consumption, ophthalmoscopic examinations, ECG 
examinations, clinical pathology, and macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed that could be 
related to elexacaftor. The NOAEL in this study was 40mg/kg/day, which is 11 times above the 
intended clinical exposure. In the long term (39-week) repeat dose toxicity study, elexacaftor was 
relatively well tolerated at doses up to 14 mg/kg/day (approximately 19 times above the intended 
clinical exposure). There was no observed mortality and there were no elexacaftor related effects on 
macroscopic necropsy observations, urinalysis, urine chemistry, ophthalmoscopic or 
electrocardiographic examinations. All elexacaftor related changes were observed at 14 mg/kg/day, 
the highest dose tested. These included inappetence, thinning condition and animals being cold to the 
touch. Food consumption was reduced up to week 26. The liver was the main target organ for 
observed changes, likely due to enzymatic induction. In both males and females, minimal-mild 
hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed. In males, this was accompanied by mild vacuolation of the 
gallbladder epithelium due to local irritation. The liver changes were further correlated with increased 
absolute and relative liver weight and slightly increased ALT in males. In both males and females, total 
bilirubin was slightly increased. In the testes, minimal or mild, bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the 
seminiferous tubules was present in males administered 14 mg/kg/day that did not resolve during the 
recovery period. There were no noticeable changes in qualitative decreases in sperm content in the 
epididymides lumina, nor was there cellular debris noted. Nevertheless, the male reproductive organ is 
a target organ based on findings in both rat and dog. 
Studies in rats with combinations of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Dosing for 28 days with high dose triple combination (TC) in male rats 40/45/30 mg/kg/day 
(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) resulted in similar adverse microscopic gastric and bone marrow and 
body weight findings to those described with elexacaftor alone at 150 mg/kg/day. Adverse decreases

in body weight gains were noted in male rats administered the low dose TC 20/45/30 mg/kg/day 
(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor), which was consistent with an additive effect of elexacaftor and 
tezacaftor. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor -related organ weight changes were present in the 
following organs in males only: adrenal glands, prostate gland, seminal vesicles with coagulating 
glands, and thyroid/parathyroid gland at 20/45/30 and 40/45/30 mg/kg/day, and epididymides and 
thymus at 40/45/30 mg/kg/day. Microscopic correlates consisted of cortical hypertrophy/vacuolation in 
the adrenal glands, atrophy in the prostate, secretory depletion in the seminal vesicles/coagulating 
glands, germ cell debris/oligospermia in the epididymides, and lymphoid depletion in the thymus. Male 
reproductive organs are considered a target organ for toxicity. The higher thyroid/parathyroid gland 
weights did not have any microscopic correlates. Organ weight changes noted in the thymus and 
adrenal gland were considered to be stress-related secondary to test article administration and not 
toxicologically relevant.   
No new or synergistic adverse findings were observed with the triple combination after one month. 
However, the adverse body weight effects in males already at the lowest dose result in a NOAEL that 
cannot be determined for male animals. In females, the NOAEL is 7.5/45/30 mg/kg/day 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. However, potential synergistic effects on fertility were not investigated 
with the triple combination which is acceptable by CHMP since the observation in rat occurs at 
exposures above those reached in clinic. 
A subsequent study evaluated elexacaftor alone, in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor or with 
tezacaftor and D-ivacaftor for 13 weeks. The latter group was not assessed as it does not represent 
the present clinical application under review. Of 13 deceased animals (early euthanasia or found dead), 
the unscheduled deaths of two main study males at 35/45/30 mg/kg elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
and one male at 35/45/25 mg/kg elexacaftor/tezacaftor/D-ivacaftor were considered likely to be drug-
related based on clinical signs of hunched posture and reduced body weight gains. Effects on clinical 
pathology parameters seen in these animals euthanized early were generally similar in nature, 
although of a greater magnitude, to changes seen in male and female rats at the end of the 13-week 
dosing period at equivalent dose levels. In addition, there were a number of effects in animals 
euthanized early that were indicative of stress/loss of body condition and/or inflammation and were 
generally consistent with the microscopic findings in these animals.    
In animals surviving until the end of the study, test article-related clinical observations were noted and 
consisted of hunched posture, thin body condition and piloerection, which were only noted in male rats 
given 35mg/kg/day and in female rats given 12.5mg/kg/day elexacaftor alone.   
Test article-related body weight effects were noted in males and females given the triple combination 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor or D-ivacaftor and in females given the dual combination 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor. None of the body weight effects seen in males or females in this study were 
considered to be clinically relevant, since animals steadily gained weight over the duration of the study 
and the overall health of the animals was not affected. Similarly, decreased food consumption was 
noted in animals given the triple combination elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. This was not 
toxicologically relevant because animals steadily gained weight and there were no adverse effects on 
final mean body weights. Small epididymides and testes at 35/45/30 mg/kg/day 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was observed in 1 animal and was test article related. These findings 
correlated microscopically to severe seminiferous tubule atrophy in the testes and oligospermia with 
cellular debris in the epididymides. In other animals, reduced testes and epiydimides weight were 
observed in males given the triple combination elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Microscopically this 
correlated with degeneration/atrophy in the testes, and increased germ cell debris and/or oligospermia 
in the epididymides.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 43/44 
 
 
 
A number of other microscopic changes were considered to be secondary to effects on body weight 
and/or food consumption, stress, or metabolic enzyme induction. These included effects on the liver, 
adrenal glands, and thymus. Except for the testicular changes, none of these findings were 
toxicologically relevant based on the absence of correlating observations, and/or low incidence and/or 
severity.  In conclusion, this study did not reveal adverse synergistic effects of combining elexacaftor 
and ivacaftor and tezacaftor. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for males given the triple 
combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was considered to be 20/45/30 mg/kg/day, and the 
NOAEL for females given the triple combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was considered to 
be 12.5/40/30 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure multiple of 4/1/9-fold over the intended 
clinical exposure for males, and 7/2/16 fold for females. 
Studies in dogs with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Elexacaftor was tested in combination with tezacaftor and as a triple combination of elexacaftor, 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor in dogs receiving either combination daily for 28 days. There were no test 
article related effects on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmoscopic and electrocardiographic examinations, haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, 
urinalysis, organ weight, or macroscopic evaluations. The only finding was minimal to mild dilated 
lacteals in the duodenum, ileum and jejunum of male and female dogs. This finding has already been 
observed in safety studies with tezacaftor and is considered tezacaftor-related. However, in the 
absence of correlated findings, this finding was not considered to be toxicologically relevant. The 
NOAEL in this study was the highest dose tested, 15/50/10 mg/kg/day 
elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. However, as this study was limited to one month in duration and did 
not contain a recovery period, a true dose response could not be established due to the doses 
selected. 
Genotoxicity 
Elexacaftor was not genotoxic in a bacterial and a mammalian in vitro assay in the presence or 
absence of S9 metabolizing mix. Elexacaftor was also not genotoxic in a chromosomal aberration assay 
in vivo. Similarly, ivacaftor and tezacaftor are not genotoxic, as previously established. 
Carcinogenicity 
A 6-month explorative study in Tg-RasH2 mice was conducted with elexacaftor with mice receiving up 
to 50 mg/kg/day. This study is in accordance with relevant international guidelines. There were no 
neoplastic lesions noted at any dose, suggesting that elexacaftor is likely not carcinogenic. However, 
given that the Tg RASH2 mouse data are only a rough measure of carcinogenic potential, are not fully 
reliable and are difficult to translate, whether elexacaftor is not carcinogenic for humans should be 
determined in a formal carcinogenicity study, which is currently ongoing. As previously established, 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor are non-carcinogenic. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Elexacaftor was evaluated in a rat fertility study. Males and females in the high dose group (75/35 
mg/kg/day, respectively) showed decreased bodyweight which was more pronounced in males than in 
females. Considering bodyweight loss remained below 10% this was not adverse. There were no other 
notable clinical changes that could be attributed to elexacaftor. 
Elexacaftor had effects on male and female reproductive parameters in the fertility and early 
embryonic development (FEED) study, as 6 breeding pairs in the high-dose groups for males and 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

females did not produce a litter. One of the females that was nongravid had prolonged diestrus, and 2 
of the males that did not sire a litter showed lower sperm motility. This resulted in lower male and 
female fertility, male copulation, and female conception indices in the 75 mg/kg/day group males and 
35 mg/kg/day group females. The changes are considered adverse, and in females likely due to 
alterations in estrous cycling. No embryonic toxicity was identified. The NOAEL for fertility for males is 
therefore 55 mg/kg/day and for females 35 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for embryonic toxicity for males is 
55 mg/kg/day and for females 35 mg/kg/day. 
In an embryofetal development study with elexacaftor in rats, maternal toxicity in the form of body 
weight loss was noted in the highest dose group (40 mg/kg/day) and resulted in the early euthanasia 
of 2 females. Pathology in these animals showed enlarged, dark red discoloured adrenal glands in both 
females, and dark red areas in the stomach and a small spleen and thymus gland were noted in 1 
female. Body weight loss was also observed in the 25 mg/kg/day group but was limited and not 
adverse. Nevertheless, fetal bodyweight was adversely reduced in both 25mg/kg/day and 40 
mg/kg/day groups. There were no other adverse fetal findings. The maternal NOAEL in this study was 
25mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for the offspring was 15 mg/kg/day. 
In an embryofetal development study with elexacaftor in rabbits, maternal toxicity in the form of body 
weight loss was noted in the highest dose group (125 mg/kg/day) and resulted in the early euthanasia 
of 2 females. There were no notable pathology changes in these animals. Decreased defecation 
correlated to decreased food consumption was also noted in the high dose females. Decreased 
defecation without weight loss or decreased food consumption was noted in the 50 mg/kg/day and 100 
mg/kg/day group. There were no meaningful changes on post-implantation loss, number and 
percentage of viable fetuses, mean fetal body weights, and fetal sex ratios. Mean numbers of corpora 
lutea and implantation sites and the mean litter proportions of pre-implantation loss were similar 
across all groups. There were no differences in fetal morphology, and skeletal, external or visceral 
malformations or variations compared to controls. The maternal NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day. The fetal 
NOAEL was 125mg/kg/day. 
A peri- and postnatal development study with elexacaftor was conducted in rats. No adverse effects on 
F0 maternal clinical observations, body weights, or food consumption were noted during gestation or 
lactation maternal clinical observations, body weights, or food consumption were noted during 
gestation or lactation for females at any dose level. No elexacaftor-related effects were noted on mean 
gestation lengths or the process of parturition for F0 females, and no elexacaftor-related macroscopic 
findings or effects on the mean number of former implantation sites and unaccounted-for sites were 
noted at any dose level. There were no elexacaftor-related effects on the mean number of F1 pups 
born, live litter size, percentage males at birth, postnatal survival, pup clinical observations, or 
necropsy findings. In the highest dose group tested (10 mg/kg/day) male and female pup body weight 
was reduced but were not toxicologically meaningful. Lower mean absolute body weights persisted up 
to PND 112. There were no other notable effects that could be attributed to elexacaftor. The NOAEL for 
F0 animals and F1 offspring is considered to be 10 mg/kg/day. 
Elexacaftor was assessed in a juvenile toxicity study in rats. Male rats were given 7.5, 15, or 30 
mg/kg/day and female rats given 5, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg/day from PND 7 through PND 70. Transient but 
considerable changes in body weight were noted in males given 30mg/kg/day elexacaftor. Reduced 
body weight was 27.4% of control values on PND24, corresponding with reduced food consumption. 
Over time, these changes improved and at PND70 body weight was 7.6% lower than the control group. 
Due to the rapid loss of weight, this change is considered adverse despite being transient. There were 
no other remarkable elexacaftor related changes in males apart from a minor non-adverse reduction in 
cholesterol levels. In females, notable changes included minor increases in total bilirubin and ALT. In 
females with increased ALT, creatinine kinase was increased in 4/5 animals with or without increases in 
AST. These changes are indicative of muscle damage, likely due to the study procedure in the absence 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

of correlating signs to suggest liver injury. However, no histopathology was conducted and this study is 
only supportive. The NOAEL in males is considered to be 15 mg/kg/day due to rapid, adverse but 
transient body weight loss and 15 mg/kg/day in females, the highest dose tested. 
For tezacaftor, the overall conclusions from reproductive and developmental toxicity studies indicate 
that it is not a reproductive and/or developmental toxicant. tezacaftor did not result in toxicity to male 
or female reproductive systems or have effects on early embryonic development. Effects on fetal 
development and growth of offspring (lower F1 generation survival/lactation indices, decreased pup 
body weights pre- and post-weaning and lower reproductive capacity in F1 generation rats) were only 
noted at significantly maternally toxic dose levels. For ivacaftor, the overall conclusions from 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies indicate it is not teratogenic; moreover, it has only 
minimal effects on female reproduction and fetal development in rats, attributable to significant 
maternal toxicity. 
Local tolerance 
A series of in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to assess the local tolerability of elexacaftor to 
support limited human IV administration. Elexacaftor is well tolerated, is non-irritant to skin or eye, is 
not phototoxic and is compatible with human whole blood. As part of the development and registration 
of Symkevi and Kalydeco, both tezacaftor and ivacaftor were assessed in similar package of handler 
safety studies (irritation potential in dermal and ocular tissues and the potential for skin sensitization), 
which concluded both tezacaftor and ivacaftor to be a non-irritant and non-sensitizing in dermal 
studies and that tezacaftor and ivacaftor were both reported as a mild irritant in ocular irritancy. 
Tezacaftor did not demonstrate phototoxic potential in this assay and therefore does not appear to 
present any risk of phototoxicity in humans. Ivacaftor was not tested for phototoxicity however the 
safety profile is characterised also based on the existing post marketing experience since approval.  
Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites and impurities 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to assess independent metabolites of elexacaftor. This is 
sufficiently justified. Impurities in the elexacaftor drug substance are sufficiently qualified.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
As there is no validated animal model for CF that fully mimics the human multi organ affected disease 
and all three components bind specifically to CFTR, the use of in vitro systems to study the 
pharmacology of elexacaftor only or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor can be accepted. 
Use of HBE cells as model for in vitro pharmacology 
As the ion channel activity and cellular function of primary CF HBE cultures are similar to in vivo airway 
tissue and as HBE cells from CF patients with a mutant CFTR expresses many characteristics 
associated with CF pathogenesis, including defective ion and fluid transport, the primary HBE cells of 
CF patients with known CFTR mutations can as such be regarded as relevant model system to study 
the pharmacological action of CFTR modulators. 
Upon request by CHMP and to further support the use of HBE cells as model for in vitro pharmacology 
analysis, the applicant included a graphical comparison of the amount of chloride transport in HBE cells 
expressing wildtype or a mutated CFTR variant and clinical parameters such as Δ (change in) Sweat 
Chloride and ppFEV1 in healthy subjects or patients expressing mutated CFTR variant. This plot (see 
below), shows a correlation between the in vitro performance of HBE cells, with regard to chloride 
transport and clinical performance (Δ Sweat Chloride and ppFEV1). The plot suggests translatability of 
the in vitro results towards clinical results and would thus provide further support for the use of HBE 
cells to study in vitro pharmacology, but underlying data is missing, hampering a definitive conclusion 
on in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC). 
Assessment of the in vitro data supporting IVIVC and the Applicant F508Del only hypothesis: 
In  initial graphs the different CFTR mutations were grouped together, but the applicant was asked to 
derive the correlation on a per mutation basis. The applicant was furthermore requested to provide 
information on a non-clinical vs clinical comparison with data upon clinical treatment, including in vitro 
data (untreated, Symkevi & Kaftrio treated) of the different F/F (3) and F/MF (4) obtained in chloride 
transport assay and clinical in vivo data of these mutants in untreated fashion and in treated fashion 
(with Symkevi and Kaftrio), and as well plot these data, to support the use of HBE cells for the in vitro 
pharmacology analysis as well as the translatability of the results to the clinic (thus the in vitro in vivo 
correlation).

Figure 4:Relationship Between In Vitro and In Vivo Measures of CFTR function 
.
The HBE cells are considered appropriate to investigate the effect on CFTR processing and conductance 
upon incubation with (different combinations of) the three components of Kaftrio. However, the IVIVC 
relationship seems disproportional for the in vitro components. Furthermore, the applicant did not 
attempt to provide a IVIVC on a per mutation basis. The answer falls short in that respect. In addition, 
combining the different MF mutants into one F/MF group is not sufficiently substantiated with in vitro 
data. 
From HBE cells from each donor, the incubation with Kaftrio results in an increase in chloride transport 
as compared to DMSO, Symkevi, VX-445 alone, VX-445 & ivacaftor and VX-445 & tezacaftor. Thus, for 
all donors, Kaftrio seems to result in improvement in chloride transport. However, it is not clear how 
this can be extrapolated to other F/MF patients. Extrapolation of the results within clinical tested F/MF 
genotypes to other F/MF genotypes may be more relevant from the clinical data. 
Upon request by CHMP, the applicant provided adequate data to demonstrate the binding of 
elexacaftor to both MSD1 and MSD2, which is different to TEZ, which binds to MSD1 only. In order to 
be functional in CF patients, the corrector should also be able to bind to mutant forms of CFTR 
resulting in CF. It can be agreed that not all mutant CFTR proteins leading to CF can be assessed but 
assessing binding of elexacaftor and/or tezacaftor to the F508del mutant and for example one 
representative of each of the 4 or 5 classes of MF CFTR mutants would have been informative. The 
applicant was asked to justify why binding of elexacaftor and/or tezacaftor was tested only on a non-
mutated CFTR variant and not on a mutated CFTR variant and explain the relevance for further non-
clinical and clinical assessment. The applicant explained that protein purification of the much less 
stable F508del-CFTR protein form is challenging and the yield will not be sufficient for protein binding 
studies. The synergistic effect of tezacaftor and elexacaftor in the Chloride increase assay on double 
F508del mutants indeed suggests that both compounds bind also the F508del mutant CFTR on a 
different region (e.g. do not compete for binding). 
Rationale for pooling in vitro data of F/F and F/MF mutants and extrapolation to all mutations 
As mentioned above, the applicant pooled the data for the three F/F mutants and the four F/MF 
mutants into two groups: F/F and F/MF. From the Peak Forskolin (FSK) Stimulated Cl- Transport data 
separated per mutant; it becomes clear that there is a substantial difference between the MF mutants 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 50/51 
 
 
 
 
 
concerning the effect of elexacaftor on the improvement of Chloride transport. A conclusion on this 
finding cannot be drawn as it remains unclear whether this is due to the difference in the effect of 
ivacaftor with respect to the different MF CFTRs or whether this may be due to the fact that the MF 
mutants do not all respond to the same extent to elexacaftor. Due to these observed differences in the 
chloride transport for the various F/MF mutants it cannot be agreed with the applicant that the data 
provided are sufficient to address the effect on processing where only one F/F donor and only one F/MF 
mutant (F/G542X) are studied. The applicant was asked to provide data on the effect of tezacaftor 
and/or ivacaftor and/or elexacaftor on CFTR processing on cells of each different MF donor separately. 
This question was raised to gain more insight in the likeness or similarity of the different MF variants 
and whether one MF variant could represent a whole group of MF as stated by the applicant. However, 
more data was not provided by the Applicant in the answer to the LoI and the discussion of the 
applicant was ultimately considered not satisfactory. Further details are provided below for 
completeness: 
In its response, the applicant explained that the G542X mutant results, due to its mutation, in a 
truncated variant which, together with a (mutant specific) severe reduction in the amount of mRNA will 
yield minimal protein levels that in the most optimal case will result in low levels of abnormal protein. 
The likeliness that this protein will add to the response upon Kaftrio incubation is low. From the 
provided data it is indeed clear that the western blot studies were only performed with cells from one 
donor from each of the afore set groups; F/F and F/MF (G542X). As one mutant is not regarded 
representative for the whole group, the applicant was requested by CHMP to provide clarifications, but 
this was not addressed. The applicant instead argued that these experiments were not designed to 
demonstrate differences between donors and different genotypes within the F/MF group. The CHMP is 
of the opinion that this information could have importantly contributed to informing on the 
resemblance of the different MF variants and support the grouping of these variants into a F/MF group 
and subsequently derive support for the requirement of the F508del allele only hypothesis with in vitro 
data. Instead, the applicant referred to clinical data to support the F508del-allele-only hypothesis in 
clinical data. This approach can be accepted by CHMP as non-clinical data are considered too limited 
and inconclusive to support such a hypothesis.  
In addition, as a percentage of total CFTR in both cell lines, the effect of the combination of tezacaftor 
and elexacaftor is additive, resulting in approximately 70% of total CFTR appearing as the mature 
CFTR from. This percentage is however reduced by the addition of ivacaftor. Decrease in the mature 
CFTR form upon treatment with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor compared to elexacaftor and 
tezacaftor alone in F/F, although not a significant difference, it is also noted for tezacaftor and 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor implying a ivacaftor mediated reduction in improvement in processing and 
trafficking, and a negative pharmacodynamic relationship. The applicant was asked to comment on the 
consistent reduction of the amount of CFTR at the membrane following treatment with ivacaftor and 
further agreed that ivacaftor does causes a reduction in the magnitude of CFTR processing and 
trafficking by elexacaftor/tezacaftor but is required to restore the defective gating. This is regarded is 
an acceptable explanation and the issue was considered solved. 
The results of the chloride transport assay show that the triple combination gave better results than 
the combination of elexacaftor with either tezacaftor or ivacaftor alone or tezacaftor with ivacaftor 
when compared per donor. Thus, addition of elexacaftor yielded for HBE cells from all donors a relative 
increase in chloride transport. However, whether this increase is substantial or not, remains a topic of 
discussion. It can be partially agreed with the applicant that ‘In vitro evidence demonstrated 
‘substantially’ increased efficacy and potency of the triple combination (TC) on HBE cells from the 
seven tested donors with mutated CFTRs when compared to mono or dual therapies with these same 
cells. The superiority of the triple combination is thus based on the relative increase in chloride 
transport per donor. It has however to be noted that in vitro the improvement of Kaftrio and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 51/52 
 
 
 
treatment with a combination of elexacaftor and ivacaftor is not very large when both are compared to 
untreated condition. Furthermore, as already reflected above, in vitro treatment with 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor gives an improvement for both the three F/F mutants (one geneotype) and the 
four F/MF mutants (three different genotypes), which was not observed in the clinic, at least not for 
the F/MF mutants. This would suggest that in vitro results cannot be directly translated to in vivo data. 
It remains unclear whether the small difference observed with Kaftrio over the combination of 
elexacaftor/ ivacaftor would translate to a clinical benefit and it is therefore questionable whether this 
difference can be considered ‘substantial’ as claimed by the Applicant.  
With regards to the effect of incubation with elexacaftor on chloride transport in CF HBE cells, the 
results are also presented per donor and show a minimal variation between results for the F/F group, 
but a more pronounced variation in the results from the F/MF group, suggesting that MF CFTR mutants 
are responding differently to the treatment with the triple combination. Three donors were used for the 
F/F group, which is limited but can be accepted considered that the variation is minimal in F/F in 
comparison to the F/MF group. MF mutations are variable and provide also a variation in the result 
(increase in chloride transport upon treatment with CFTR modulators), strongly suggesting that some 
of the MF CFTR will also respond to the triple combination. The final response to the triple combination 
may thus not be determined by the F508del allele only.  Furthermore, in vitro data that all MF mutants 
respond to the combination treatment of tezacaftor with ivacaftor (Symkevi). Therefore, the CHMP 
concluded that based on this information, MF mutants cannot be regarded as non-functional mutants 
or as not responding to the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination as defined in MF patient definition for the 
102 clinical study.  
In vitro evidence supporting the F508del single allele Applicant hypothesis: 
According to the applicant, strong in vitro evidence supports the hypothesis that the presence of a 
single F508del allele would be sufficient to provide substantial clinical benefit to CF patients with an 
F508del on one allele and a mutant CFTR on the other allele resulting in either no CFTR protein or an 
allele that does not respond to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro (minimal function [F/MF] genotype). Currently 
approved CFTR modulators failed to show benefit in this population. The CHMP did not agree with the 
applicant that this has been demonstrated for all three F/MF genotypes used in the in vitro study. In 
vitro data is thus not regarded as supportive for the above hypothesis. The applicant was therefore 
asked during the assessment to further explore their hypothesis as detailed below: 
A) provide data supporting the claim that the chosen mutations tested in the studies do not produce 
any CFTR protein and/or do not respond to TEZ or TEZ/IVA and discuss whether these three donors/ 
mutations are truly representative of all MF mutations.   
G542X is a truncation mutant, that has a truncation in the middle of the first cytosolic domain, the 
NBD1 domain. E585X is a truncated mutant as well, but here the truncation is right after the NBD1 
domain, in the linker to the R domain. Both truncation mutants have a correct first membrane 
spanning domain. The 3905insT (on DNA level) -induced shift in the reading frame results in a 
premature termination codon (PTC) mutation after five triplets, in exon 20 (L1258X). It was observed 
that the PTC introduced by the mutation does neither elicit a degradation of the mRNA through NMD 
nor an alternative splicing through NAS, but a significantly reduced amount of CFTR at the apical 
membrane in nasal epithelial cells was observed, providing a possible molecular explanation for the 
more severe phenotype observed in F508del/3905insT compound heterozygotes compared with 
F508del homozygotes. (Sanz et al., 2009*). This suggests that PTC will not always result in decrease 
of mRNA by NMD. 
The applicant refers to a publication that recalls that truncated variants are often accompanied by low 
levels of mRNA due to nonsense mediated decay (NMD) (Richards et al., Genet Med 17:404-424, 
2015). In a publication from Roy et al, it was shown that CFTR G542X, when tried to be expressed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 52/53 
 
 
 
in HEK293T cells, did not yield protein. Although the applicant did not attempt to provided experiment 
evidence of the absence of G542X CFTR protein in HBE cells, the referred publication provide 
suggestion that indeed, no protein is produced.  
For E585X, NMD might occur but is not shown for this particular mutation. As the truncation leaves the 
first cytoplasmic NBD1 domain intact, the truncated protein may be more stable than the G542X or the 
R553X mutation, the latter being referred to by the applicant. For that latter mutation (R553X), for the 
decrease of mRNA was referred to a publication. Although NMD is a process shown to occur for 
proteins with a PTC, it seems not to occur for all variants with a PTC (Sanz et al., 2009). Referring to 
proof for NMD with another CFTR mutant (R553X) is not considered supportive for a potential decrease 
in mRNA for the E585X mutation.   
There could be another scenario possible. The truncated form may be expressed as a protein 
consisting only MSD1 and NBD1 domain. This form may be can form a complex with the expressed 
F508del mutant that is expressed from the other allele, a process called trans complementation, which 
is observed and published by Liudmila Cebotaru et al. (2013** & 2014**) and Bergbower et al 
(2019****). The E585X and the F508del mutants may together be stabilized by the CFTR modulators 
as such form more function protein than one F508del allele alone. Of course, this is a hypothesis that 
currently also lack proof. However, lacking empirical proof, it is currently regarded not conclusive 
whether or not the E585X CFTR allele contributes to the increase in Chloride transport or not.  
The response to Symkevi as measured in FRT cells may not be representative for the clinical situation. 
For the Symkevi dossier, the applicant also used FRT cells. The in vitro results with the FRT cell line did 
not correlate sufficiently and not for all mutants to the clinical obtained results. Thus, information on 
the response to Symkevi for certain genotypes should be rather derived from clinical data.  
It is acknowledged that patients harbouring the three F/MF genotypes as discussed above have a 
comparable clinical profile with regard to sweat chloride levels and pancreatic insufficiency and suggest 
minimal CFTR function. Furthermore, the applicant refers to the clinical phenotype of 124 genotypes 
with additional MF mutations (nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice) of which ~98% having sweat 
chloride levels of >86 mmol/L. However, this clinical feature is not regarded to provide proof for the 
potential lack protein expression of the three F/MF genotypes analysed in vitro. Also, because of this 
data does not take into consideration the potential for improvement upon incubation or treatment with 
the modulators for the three F/MF genotypes. Real data before and after treatment of several patients 
with F/F and several patients with the three different F/MF genotypes could have evaluated for their 
supportiveness for the current hypothesis.   
B)  Provide information on the MF mutation for each of the F/MF donors. The applicant provided the 
requested data as requested above. 
C) to justify and explain the rationale for the combination of different F/MF mutants that react 
differently to the three Kaftrio components into one group.  
The applicant considered the result in chloride increase upon Kaftrio for each of the F/MF genotypes 
comparable. It is agreed with the applicant that all genotypes profit from Kaftrio treatment relatively to 
their own background chloride transport value. But, the response to Kaftrio is not comparable for all 
genotypes. As already discussed, the F/MF carrying the E585X is standing out in its response. The 
statement of the applicant that all genotypes result in truncated CFTR protein is considered confusing 
as earlier is posited that there is no protein produced.  
D) Discuss the variability in response to the triple combination of the different F/MF cell lines including 
relevant clinical data from patients with the corresponding MF genotypes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

The applicant was asked to explain the variability in the results for the different F/MF donors in the 
Chloride transport assay. The applicant noted that the observed variability is explained by the 
biological variability from the single F508del allele, which is also observed in F/F-HBE cells, and the 
inherent variability in the biological assay. However, this is not considered the case. The EC90 for the 
F/F donors are 74.2, 83.7 and 89.3 UA/cm2. The EC90 for the F/MF donors are 56.1, 55.3, 84 and 
39.8 UA/cm2. The variance between F/F ranges from 74.2-89.3 and the variance between F/MF ranges 
from 39.8-84, the latter variance being much higher than the first one. The third one in the row of 
F/MF donors (donor carrying a F508del/E585X mutation) performed better than two of the F/F donors 
in the in vitro assay. Based on the observed, relatively small variation between the three F/F donors it 
is rather unlikely that the relatively high chloride increase obtained with cells from donor 
(F508del/E585X) can be explained solely by biological variation. As the SD is rather small, the 
relatively high increase in chloride transport is also not likely due to technical variation. It rather 
suggests that the E585X CFTR mutant, which has an PTC, may produce certain level of abnormal 
protein that could, potentially become partially functional upon treatment with Kaftrio. Furthermore, 
this mutant also profits in vitro from the Symkevi treatment. This MF mutant (E585X) could thus 
potentially produce a truncated protein, as it seems that the mutant is adding to the Cl transport 
result, nor is it a mutant that is not responding to Symkevi. The suggestion from the applicant that the 
variability is either caused by the single F508del or by the technical variation of the assay seem not 
likely as the technical variation of the assay is expected to be rather small (low SD) and the biological 
variation is not observed to be that large with two F508del alleles. The conclusions of the applicant 
that none of the MF mutants will contribute to the measured increase in chloride transport is not 
agreed by CHMP.  
E) Elaborate on the consequence that the hypothesis (a single F508del allele will be sufficient to 
provide substantial clinical benefit to CF patients) is not yet agreed to be supported by in vitro data as 
these data show that MF allele contributes to the in vitro results.  
The applicant’ response suggest that the applicant is rather seeking support in clinical data for their 
hypothesis that the presence of a single F508del allele would be sufficient to provide substantial clinical 
benefit to CF patients clinical data. This approach is supported as non-clinical data are considered too 
limited and not sufficient to definitely support such hypothesis. 
Overall the applicant aims at providing evidence that all three F/MF genotypes are similar in the sense 
that they do not produce protein because of the PTC that results in decrease mRNA levels by NMD (sub 
question a). But, in contradiction the applicant notes in the response to sub question c, that truncated 
protein is formed. Empirical analysis would have been supportive to show absence of expression of the 
CFTR MF variant.  With regard to the absence of a response to Symkevi treatment, the use of invitro 
results with the FRT cell line is not supported as correlation to clinical results appeared to be rather 
weak and sometimes not occurring at all. Thus, information on the response to Symkevi for certain 
genotypes should be rather derived from clinical data. Furthermore, they argue that these genotypes 
result in the same clinical disease phenotypes and are comparable to 124 other MF mutations 
(nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice). However, this is not of support for the question whether 
different F/MF genotypes respond in the same way to Kaftrio treatment. Clinical data in treated and 
untreated fashion as requested could have been helpful. But this attempt was not made. This and the 
omission of empirical supportive data for the lack protein is regarded as a limitation. The issue is not 
further pursued. The support for the F508del only hypothesis should be retrieved from clinical data.

After spiking with the corrector(s) alone, channel opening was only very minimal. After spiking with 
the corrector(s) and the potentiator channel opening was achieved efficiently, supporting the use of 
ivacaftor in the triple combination. However, in the chloride transport assay, it appears that for one 
F/MF donor absolute level of chloride transport upon incubation with the triple combination is lower 
than the absolute level of chloride transport for two F/F donors upon incubation with the two correctors 
alone, thus lacking potentiator ivacaftor. This suggests that two correctors together may already do a 
good job, in case the (poor) result with the triple combination for that certain F/MF variant is regarded 
sufficient as an absolute result. The absolute necessity of the potentiator for channel gating activity 
seems to contradict with this observation in the assay measuring the chloride transport upon 
incubation with CFTR modulators. The applicant was asked to explain. The applicant responded that for 
each donor the addition of the potentiator contributed to the result and is therefore of value for each 
type of the donor cells. 
Additionally, there is no difference in Po values in cells treated with VX-455/IVA and VX-455/TEZ/IVA, 
0.89 ± 0.019 (VX-445-treated) and 0.86 ± 0.024 (VX-445/TEZ-treated). Both treatment groups 
increased Po to levels greater than that of normal CFTR, corresponding to 189% (VX-445-treated) and 
183% (VX-445/TEZ-treated) of normal CFTR gating activity. No data was provided for TEZ alone. 
Although VX-445 and TEZ appear to work in an additive fashion in the processing experiment (M379) 
above the gating data suggests that there is no difference between VX-445 and VX-445+Tez. Based on 
this, the applicant was asked to justify the necessity for two correctors in combination with IVA. The 
applicant responded that the experimental process in patch clamp studies does not allow for the 
contribution of VX-445 and/or TEZ in bringing CFTR to the membrane surface to be accounted for, 
which is accepted. The necessity for two correctors is justified by other studies presented by the 
applicant. Furthermore, different concentrations of TEZ and VX-445 were used in the FRT cells and 
similar results were observed for VX-445 with and without TEZ. An explanation was requested. The 
applicant’s response is not accepted as the study report states, that prior to assessing gating activity 
the cells were incubated with 1 μM VX-445 and 3μM TEZ in the presence of 10% FBS. It would be 
assumed that considering the high protein binding of VX-445 and TEZ, nonspecific binding to serum 
proteins would occur, thereby reducing the effective concentration of the compounds. The applicant 
clarified that 25% human serum (HS) was used in the chloride transport study and 10% foetal bovine 
serum (FBS) was used in the channel gating study explaining the 2.5-fold difference in the used 
concentration of elexacaftor and tezacaftor in the two experiments. 
Conclusion on In vitro in vivo correlation and in vitro demonstration supporting Applicant hypothesis  
HBE cells are considered appropriate to investigate the effect on CFTR processing and conductance 
upon incubation with (different combinations of) the three components of Kaftrio. The applicant 
submitted data underlying the IVIVC plots, however the IVIVC relationship seems disproportional for 
the in vitro components and this was supported by clear discussion on the translatability of the results 
to the clinical setting. Furthermore, as discussed above, a per mutation basis comparison has not been 
submitted nor an attempt has been made by the applicant to solve this issue with concrete data.  
The applicant did also not provide satisfactory rationale for combining the different MF mutants, which 
result in variable results in the chloride transport assay, suggesting that F/MF mutants differ are not all 
the same.  
Overall, non-clinical data are too limited and identified shortcomings were not sufficiently addressed by 
the Applicant to definitely support the Applicant hypothesis that the presence of a single F508del allele 
would be sufficient to provide substantial clinical benefit to CF patients has not been sufficiently

demonstrated in vitro. It is therefore concluded by CHMP that it is not possible to establish in vitro in 
vivo correlation and therefore clinical data are required to demonstrate the Applicant hypothesis. 
Secondary pharmacology 
It is agreed with the applicant that secondary pharmacology for tezacaftor and ivacaftor and M6-
ivacaftor are covered with the application for Kalydeco and Symkevi. 
Toxicology 
In the pivotal long term (26 week) rat repeat dose toxicity study, all animals at 75 mg/kg/day (m) and 
30 mg/kg/day (f) were terminated early (d26) due to moribundity and rapidly declining condition, 
which was preceded by decreased food consumption, severe body weight loss and one or more of the 
following observations: thin body condition, hunched posture, loss of skin elasticity, skin cold to touch, 
material around nose, and/or piloerection. The cause of death/moribund condition in most of these 
animals was erosion of the glandular mucosa of the stomach, some of which were visible as brown or 
black foci in the stomach at necropsy. This is striking considering the modest effects in females dosed 
at 30 mg/kg/day in the pivotal 28-day study. It should be noted that in rats, exposure multiples were 
low (sub 5-fold), particularly so in males. The findings are therefore potentially clinically relevant. The 
safety profiles of tezacaftor and ivacaftor have been established previously and are known.   
Differences seen in the toxicology studies are attributed to the pharmaceutical form of elexacaftor (ie 
jet milled vs non-jet milled, where jet milled elexacaftor improves systemic exposure). Body weight 
changes are primarily attributed to tezacaftor and more importantly were not seen in the clinical 
setting. However, the clinical relevance of decreased weight gain may manifest directly in weight loss 
in the clinical population. Sporadic lower consumption was noted in this treatment group which likely 
was associated with the observed decrease in body weight gain. It is accepted this is not a new finding 
as decreased weight gain has been observed in studies assessing the toxicity of TEZ and VX-445 
administered alone. Furthermore, it is accepted that further mechanistic studies examining this finding 
are not warranted.  
The male reproductive organ is a target organ based on findings in both rat and dog. In rat, small 
testes and epidydimides and reduced testes and epidydimides weight has been observed in animals 
exposed to elexacaftor or a combination of elaxacaftor/tezacaftor and ivacaftor. This correlated with 
degeneration of seminiferous tubules and atrophy, to oligo/aspermia and cellular debris in 
epididymides. In dog testes, minimal or mild, bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous 
tubules was present in males administered 14 mg/kg/day that did not resolve during the recovery 
period. There were no noticeable changes in qualitative decreases in sperm content in the 
epididymides lumina, nor was there cellular debris noted. The Applicant was requested to provide a 
mechanistic discussion on the findings, considering that reduced fertility was noted in the FEED study 
and considering the patient population, which may include more juvenile patients in the future.  
No mechanistic explanation was given by the applicant in their response. The applicant suggested that 
despite the fact that effects on male reproductive organs were seen in 2 species, human relevance is 
limited because the observations occurred at 6 times higher exposures than in clinical studies. 
However, the CHMP considered that a 5-fold multiple is generally considered as clinically relevant. 
Furthermore, a definitive statement on the resolution of the adverse findings in dog cannot be made 
because the recovery period was not long enough. While microscopic changes themselves may not be 
considered adverse within the study setting, the test-article related impairment in fertility is considered 
clinically relevant. Nevertheless, the reduced fertility was only observed in the high dose (75 
mg/kg/day in males and 35 mg/kg/day in females, respectively) with no notable findings in the low 
and mid dose groups. The applicant’s comment that synergistic testicular toxicity was not observed in 
the 13-week triple combination rat study is not endorsed. No test article related microscopic changes

were noted in any animals in the elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor or metabolites groups in this 
study whereas effects were noted in the TC at the same dose level. The functional effects of these 
findings have not been assessed considering the limited incidence and severity of the findings. The 
potential for synergistic toxicity on male reproduction has not been characterised and this is reflected 
in the SmPC.   
The 2-year elexacaftor rat carcinogenicity bioassay is ongoing and will be completed in 2020 and 
reported out in 2021, following the initial application submission. The results should be submitted by 
end 2021. 
ERA 
VX-445 (elexacaftor) is not PBT, nor vPvB. PECsurface water is above the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and thus 
a phase II environmental risk assessment should be conducted as a post-marketing commitment.  
The applicant is requested by CHMP to perform the following studies with VX-445 (elexacaftor) as 
follow-up measures according to the EMA guideline on ERA (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2): 
-  Adsorption-desorption using a batch equilibrium method (OECD 106) using 3 soil types and 2 types 
of sewage sludge; 
-  Ready biodegradability test (OECD 301); 
-  Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308); 
Algal growth inhibition test (OECD 201); 
-  Daphnia sp. reproduction test (OECD 211, use version 2012); 
-  Fish, early life stage (E.L.S.) toxicity test (OECD 210, use version 2013); 
-  Activated sludge, respiration inhibition test (OECD 209, use version 2010) 
From all requested chronic toxicity studies and the OECD 209 test, a NOEC and/or EC10 is needed for 
the risk assessment. In case a limit test is performed, the OECD guidelines should be followed: if the 
limit test results in a statistically significant effect, a new test to determine a dose-response 
relationship should be performed, from which a NOEC and/or EC10 should be reported.  
The applicant is also reminded to harmonise the data for the Fpen refinement of VX-445 and VX-661, 
i.e. to use the same source, preferably with the most recent data and to use the same value for both 
actives. This should be the value for the Member State with the highest prevalence, as per the EMA 
guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 (Rev. 1), in order to make the ERA protective for all MS. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data suggests that elexacaftor is safe for use in patients when used in the 
approved indication. No novel or synergistic adverse effects have been identified in combination 
studies with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. A 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats is being conducted and will 
be submitted as a post marketing commitment by 31 December 2021. The ERA will be completed as a 
post marketing commitment by December 2022. A letter of commitment has been provided by the 
Applicant.

VX-445 is considered a BCS class 2 (low solubility/high permeability) compound. The product has a 
single chiral centre, however, in light of the assumed stability of the chiral configuration, chiral 
interconversion in vivo is not expected. 
The pharmacokinetics of VX-445 (and tezacaftor and ivacaftor in combination with VX-445), as well as 
its major metabolites were investigated both in healthy subjects and CF patients.  
VX-445 as well as tezacaftor and ivacaftor were analysed in plasma and urine using liquid 
chromatography with MS/MS detection. Analytical methods for VX-445 and its major metabolite M23-

445 were indicated by the Applicant to be adequately validated, with accuracy, specificity and stability 
meeting appropriate requirements.  
Physiology-based PK (PBPK) model. A PBPK model was developed to simulate the VX-445 PK profile in 
the presence of moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (typical inhibitors used: fluconazole, erythromycin and 
verapamil). For this purpose, SimCyp was used, a PBPK platform that has been shown to yield 
acceptable prediction of the effect of inhibition of CYP3A4 by mild, moderate and strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 for a number of known CYP3A4 substrates. For the specific purpose of this application, the VX-
445 PBPK model was validated by simulating VX-445 exposure in the absence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, 
and in the presence of the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole, and comparing this exposure with that 
obtained in the actual VX-445 PK studies and in the itraconazole-VX-445 drug-drug interaction study. 
The baseline VX-445 PK profiles without CYP3A4 inhibitors, as well as the interaction results on VX-445 
AUC and Cmax, appeared to be mimicked adequately by the PBPK simulations, and validation of the 
PBPK model is considered sufficiently in line with requirements stated in the Guideline on the reporting 
of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and simulation for this High regulatory 
impact situation (i.e., to waive a clinical DDI study with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors). On this basis, 
the VX-445 PBPK model is considered qualified for CYP3A interaction predictions related to moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A based on interpolation between the validated situations without and without a 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. The same SimCyp PBPK platform was accepted for Symkevi 
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor) Marketing Authorisation Application for prediction of the effect of moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors on the PK of ivacaftor and tezacaftor.  
Population-PK model. A two-compartment model with zero-order delivery to the absorption 
compartment and a first-order absorption model, including four transit compartments, provided a 
reasonable description of the PK for VX-445. The PK model for M23-445 was developed sequentially 
using the empirical Bayes estimates from the VX-445 final model, assuming that 57.4% of parent is 
metabolized to M23-445, although changes in the amount of drug assumed to be metabolised did not 
change the predicted AUC for M23 AUC-445. Although especially the M23-445 popPK model appears to 
underestimate especially the higher exposures to M23-445, the models appears to yield a reasonable 
description of the data.  
The typical estimate (95% CI) of the VX-445 clearance for a reference subject (70 kg, white, CF 
subject receiving a triple combination of VX-445 200mg qd/TEZ 100mg qd/IVA 150mg q12h in fixed-
dose combination formulation) was 1.05 (1.01, 1.09) l/h, which is in reasonable agreement with the 
observed clearance in healthy subjects which ranged from 1.23 to 1.97 l/h (Study 001 and 003). 
During the exploratory graphical analysis, it was evident that the absorption phase was different in 
healthy subjects and CF patients, with a mean transit time of 2.36 hours in healthy volunteers and 
0.81 hour in CF patients. Consequently, adding a disease status adjustment on the transit rate 
improved the model fit and reduced the bias. 
Absorption 
Following administration of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA FDC tablet under fed conditions, maximum plasma 
concentrations for VX-445 were obtained after approximately 6 (4 to 12) hours. The absolute 
bioavailability of VX-445 under the proposed posology with food is approximately 80%. The absorption 
of VX-445 from a single agent tablet and the final VX-445/TEZ/IVA FDC tablet under fed conditions 
appears similar. 
Exposure to VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in CF patients was comparable to that in healthy 
volunteers. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 59/60 
 
 
 
The AUC of VX-445 administered as separate tablets in the fed state increased approximately 2.5-fold 
relative to administration in the fasted state. Based on the MAAs for IVA (Kalydeco) and TEZ/IVA 
(Symkevi), it is known that the bioavailability of IVA increases approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when 
administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted conditions, while food has no effect on 
exposures of TEZ and its metabolites. As for Kalydeco and Symkevi, it is proposed to administer VX-
445/TEZ/IVA FDC tablets with a moderate-fat meal. All phase 3 studies for VX-445/TEZ/IVA FDC 
tablets have indeed been conducted with dosing under fed conditions. 
Distribution  
VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, VX-445 and 
tezacaftor primarily bind to albumin and ivacaftor to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. After 
single oral administration of VX-445 200 mg in combination with tezacaftor 100 mg and ivacaftor 150 
mg in healthy subjects under fed conditions, the mean (SD) for apparent volume of distribution of VX-
445, TEZ, and IVA was 53.7 (17.7), 82.0 (22.3), and 293 (89.8) L, respectively. Neither VX-445, 
tezacaftor nor ivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells.  
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism data of VX-445 demonstrated that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the CYP isozymes 
involved in VX-445 metabolism. Based on the provided mass-balance Study 003, M23-445 was 
identified as the only major metabolite circulating in plasma, which accounted for 17.3% of the total 
circulating radioactivity, with a mean metabolite-to-parent (M23-445/VX-445) AUC ratio in plasma of 
26% after single dose administration. The mean metabolite-to-parent AUC ratio at steady-state in 
healthy subjects ranged from approximately 35% to 50%. M23-445 has similar potency to VX-445 in 
F/MF-HBE cells and is considered pharmacologically active. Overall, VX-445 is considered responsible 
for the major part (50-65%) of its clinical activity, however, there is a significant contribution (35-
50%) of metabolite M23-445. 
Elimination 
The mean effective t1/2 of VX-445, administered as monotherapy, and its major metabolite M23-445 in 
healthy subjects were reasonably comparable, i.e. 20 and 23 hours, respectively. Following 
administration of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA FDC tablets in healthy subjects, the mean (SD) effective 
elimination t1/2 of VX-445 was 24.7 (4.9) hours and in the Phase 3 studies 102 and 103, this was 
similar, being 27.4 (9.31) hours. Apparent clearance of VX-445 in healthy subjects ranged from 1.23 
to 1.97 l/h. 
The majority of VX-445 related radioactivity was recovered in faeces (87.3% in 14 days), with minimal 
renal excretion (approximately 0.23% radioactivity in urine). The concentrations of unchanged VX-445 
in urine were generally below the limit of quantification, indicating that renal excretion of VX-445 is 
negligible in humans. VX-445 is mainly cleared by metabolism in humans, as the mean unchanged 
parent recovered in faeces accounted for about 22.7% of the administered radioactive dose. 
PK of metabolites. Pharmacokinetics of the active and major VX-445 metabolite M23-445 has been 
investigated to a reasonable extent. M23-445 has a t1/2 that is comparable to that of VX-445. Under 
steady-state, exposure to M23-445 is comparable to somewhat lower than that of VX-445.  
Dose proportionality, time-dependency and accumulation. Exposure to VX-445 (administered as 
monotherapy or in combination with TEZ and IVA) increase in an approximately dose-proportional 
manner with increasing doses from 60 mg to 340 mg once daily. Major metabolite M23 445 exposure 
increased slightly more than dose proportional from 100 to 280 mg qd. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 60/61 
 
 
 
The accumulation ratio of 2-3.7 for VX-445, when given once daily, is in line with the VX-445 t1/2 at 
steady-state, ranging from 17.6 to 27.9 hours. Steady-state exposures are achieved within 
approximately 7 days for both VX-445 and M23-445 after the start of dosing. VX-445 exposure mean 
accumulation ratio, and t1/2 were similar when VX 445 was administered in combination with TEZ and 
IVA relative to the administration as monotherapy.  
Variability. Overall, VX-445 and M23-445 had a moderate (34%) and high (53%) intersubject 
variability, respectively.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment  
In light of the minimal renal excretion observed for VX-445 (approximately 0.23% of the radioactivity 
in urine) the pharmacokinetic data in renally impaired patients is considered acceptable, and no dose 
adjustment for renal impairment in the SmPC is considered necessary. 
In human pharmacokinetic studies of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor, there was minimal 
elimination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor in urine (only 0.23%, 13.7% [0.79% as unchanged 
medicine], and 6.6% of total radioactivity, respectively). 
Hepatic impairment 
A large proportion of VX-445 related radioactivity was recovered in faeces (87.3% in 14 days), and 
metabolism plays an important role in the clearance of VX-445. Therefore, hepatic function is expected 
to have an important effect on VX-445 clearance. VX-445 pharmacokinetics has not yet been studied 
in subjects with hepatic impairment. The Applicant argues that an increase in exposure of VX-445 
similar to TEZ and IVA is expected in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and 
therefore applies the dose-recommendation for subjects with hepatic impairment as is in place for 
tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Symkevi) also for Kaftrio.  
Gender, race, weight and age 
Based on popPK Study O401, in which data from 244 male subjects and 174 female subjects were 
included, gender did not affect VX-445 exposure. In the same popPK study, M23-445 clearance in 
females was 22.4% lower (95% CI 13.8-31%) compared to male CF patients. Although the exposure 
of the active metabolite M23-445 appears somewhat increased in females as compared to males, 
bearing in mind that the majority of the clinical activity (50-65%) appears to be governed by parent 
VX-445, it is agreed that the observed 28.9% higher M23-445 AUC in females is unlikely to be 
clinically relevant. 
In the popPK simulations, in which data from 373 White, 30 Black or African American, 1 multiple and 
14 with other ethnic backgrounds (no Asian) were included, about 22% decreased exposure to VX-445 
was noted in African-American subjects as compared to White subjects. Based on PopPK/PD 
simulations, this ~22% decrease in VX-445 AUC in African-American subjects did not translate into 
differences in the pharmacodynamics endpoints of ppFEV1 and SwCl. No relevant difference in 
exposure in other races on VX-445 exposure was noted. 
No relevant effect of weight on VX-445 exposure was observed in CF subjects >40 kg or <90 kg. 
In the popPK analysis, age 12 to <18 years (n=72) or ≥18 years (n=346) did not to appear to affect 
VX-445 nor M23-445 exposure to a significant extent. No subjects over the age of 59 were included. 
Data in patients <12 years may be provided at a later stage via the paediatric development 
programme.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Interactions in vitro 
Substrate in vitro. Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4/5 are the main CYP isoforms involved in VX-445 
metabolism. With regard to drug transporters, in vitro, VX-445 and M23-445 are substrate for the 
efflux transporter P-gp. VX-445 and M23-445 are no substrates for OATP1B1 and OATP 1B3. However, 
exposure to VX-445 is not expected to be affected significantly by concomitant inhibitors of P-gp due 
to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact.  
Inhibition/induction in vitro  
Based on the outcome of the in vitro tests, indicating low in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 and lack of induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 
by VX-445 and M23-445, no in vivo inhibition or induction of CYPs by VX-445 nor M23-445 is expected. 
Based on in vitro data, VX-445 and M23 are substrates for (Breast cancer resistance Protein) BCRP, 
however, in vivo inhibition of BCRP is unlikely to result in relevant changes in the VX-445 or  
M23-445 PK.  
With regard to drug transporters, based on in vitro data, the potential of VX-445/M23-445 to inhibit P-
gp efflux in vivo is predicted to be low, however, it cannot be excluded that VX-445 and M23-445 
inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vivo. Further, based on in vitro data and on simulation using a 
mechanistic static model (for AOT3), the DDI potential of VX-445 and M23-445 through their inhibition 
of OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K is predicted to be low. However, VX-445 possibly 
inhibits BCRP in vivo to such extent that an increased exposure to BCRP substrates like rosuvastatin 
may be expected, and this is indicated in the SmPC section 4.5.  
Effect of co-administered drugs on VX-445/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in vivo 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole caused a substantial increase in the 
exposure of VX-445 (2.8-fold increase in AUC0-24h). It was already known that co-administration of the 
strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole resulted in a 4-fold increased AUC0-24h for TEZ and a 16-fold 
increase in AUC0-12h for IVA.  
Further, based on the results of PBPK modelling, co-administration of the moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
fluconazole, erythromycin, and verapamil on VX-445 exposure was predicted to yield an approximate 
1.9- to 2.3-fold increase in the AUC of VX-445. 
Therefore, a reduction in the dose of VX-445/TEZ/IVA combination therapy is recommended for co-
administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The proposed dose modifications are as 
follows and consistent with those of TEZ/IVA combination therapy: 
• When co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin), the dose should be reduced to only 2 
tablets of VX-445 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg taken approximately 3-4 days apart (i.e. 2 tablets 
twice a week). The evening dose of IVA should not be taken. This dose adjustment provides a 3.5-fold 
lower dose of VX-445 and TEZ and 7-fold lower dose of IVA and is consistent with the recommendation 
for TEZ/IVA and IVA during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors.  
• When co-administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, 
verapamil), the dose should be reduced to 2 tablets of VX-445 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg in the 
morning of every other day and a dose of IVA 150 mg should be taken in the morning, every other 
day, alternating with the VX-445/TEZ/IVA dose. The evening dose of IVA should not be taken. This 
Assessment report

dose adjustment provides a 2-fold lower dose of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA, and is consistent with the 
recommendation for TEZ/IVA and IVA during co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
Co-administration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA with grapefruit juice, which contains 1 or more components that 
moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA. Therefore, food containing 
grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 
Based on the provided data, the dose adjustment and the recommendation against the concomitant 
use of CYP3A inducers are considered acceptable. 
Effect of VX-445/TEZ/IVA on co-administered drugs in vivo 
 In light of the low in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and 
CYP3A4 and lack of induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 by VX-445 or M23-445, no dose 
adjustment is necessary when co-administering VX-445 with any CYP substrate. However, ivacaftor 
may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during co 
administration of warfarin with VX-445/TEXZ/IVA and IVA is recommended. Other medicinal products 
for which exposure may be increased due to this DDI include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal 
products should be used with caution. 
Due to the potential inhibition of P-gp by IVA, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended 
when co-administering VX-445/TEZ/IVA with sensitive P-gp substrates, e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine, 
everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or other medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp with narrow 
therapeutic windows.  
No clinically significant DDI between ethinyl estradiol (EE)/ levonorgestrel (LN) and VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
(i.e., <33% increased exposure in EE/LN) was observed when the oral contraceptive was co-
administrated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA in healthy subjects. These results indicate that co-administration 
with TEZ/IVA is not expected to reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. 
Overall, VX-445, as well as tezacaftor and ivacaftor pharmacokinetics have been investigated to a 
reasonable degree.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology  
Sweat chloride concentration is a direct measure of CFTR function in the sweat gland that is used as a 
PD marker of on-target activity of CFTR modulators. The design, methodology and results of the sweat 
chloride test will be described and discussed with the pivotal trials.  
Secondary pharmacology  
The effect of VX-445 on QT/QTc interval was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and 
active-controlled, parallel with nested crossover, multiple-dose ECG study following doses of 200 and 
400 mg qd. A total of 64 healthy male and female subjects were randomized 2:1:1 to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups. Group 1 received VX-445 200 mg qd for 7 days, followed by 400 mg qd for 7 days. A nested 
crossover design was utilized for moxifloxacin and placebo in Groups 2A and 2B.  
Serial ECGs and matching PK samples were collected for assessment of VX-445, M23-445, and 
moxifloxacin plasma concentrations. Continuous ECGs were extracted in up to 10 replicates predose on 
Days -1, 1, 8, 15, and 16, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 23.5 hours postdose (Days 2, 9, and 
17). The primary analysis of ∆QTcF for therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of VX-445 was based 
on C-QTc analysis of VX-445 and M23-445. Assay sensitivity was evaluated by C-QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin on ∆QTcF.   
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 63/64 
 
 
 
VX-445 did not have an effect on the QTc interval in Study 009. Mean ∆QTcF values following VX-445 
were negative at all postdose time points and mean ∆∆QTcF ranged between -2.7 and 1.4 msec on 
Day 8 for 200 mg qd and between -4.1 and -0.6 msec on Day 15 for 400 mg qd.  
In the C-QTc analysis, a full model including both VX-445 and M23-445 and their interaction was 
initially fit. After the model selection procedure, the final model included M23-445 only, and this model 
represented the data reasonably well. The estimated slope of the C-QTc relationship was very shallow 
and slightly negative (-0.0004 msec per ng/mL [90% CI: -0.00080, -0.000004]), with a small, not 
statistically significant treatment effect-specific intercept of 0.1 msec (90% CI: -2.61, 2.86). Based on 
this C-QTc analysis, a QTcF effect above 10 msec for both VX-445 and M23-445 can be excluded up to 
VX-445 plasma concentrations of approximately 32.7 µg/mL and M23-445 plasma concentrations of 
approximately 14.0 µg/mL. 
Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by the moxifloxacin C-QTc relationship with a statistically 
significant slope and by demonstrating that the predicted effect at Cmax was above 5 msec. 
VX-445 at the studied doses did not have an effect on PR and QRS intervals.  
At the studied VX-445 doses of 200 and 400 mg qd, there was an increase in HR, with a largest mean 
placebo-corrected change from baseline HR (∆∆HR) of 3.2 beats per minute (bpm) at 1 hour postdose 
on Day 8 (200 mg qd) and 7.0 bpm at 8 hours postdose on Day 15 (400 mg qd).  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of VX-445 and tezacaftor and ivacaftor in combination with VX-445, as well as 
its major metabolites, were investigated both in healthy subjects and CF patients.  
VX-445 as well as tezacaftor and ivacaftor were analysed in plasma and urine using liquid 
chromatography with MS/MS detection. In general, analytical methods for VX-445 and its major 
metabolite M23-445 were adequately validated, with accuracy, specificity and stability meeting 
appropriate requirements. Adequate revalidation data for the applied analytical methods, including an 
additional QC covering the 30-50% range of the calibration curve, were provided. 
Distribution and excretion. The volume of distribution of TEZ in Study 005 of 82 (22.3) L was much 
smaller than the TEZ volume of distribution observed for Symkevi, i.e.  271 (157) L. Further, based on 
the previous MAA for Symkevi, in CF patients, tezacaftor t1/2 was 156 (52.7) hours, whereas in the 
current dossier, the mean (SD) elimination t1/2 of TEZ following administration of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
FDC tablets in healthy subjects was 60.3 (15.7) hours, and in the currently provided Phase 3 studies 
102 and 103, the effective t1/2 of TEZ under steady state conditions in CF subjects was approximately 
12 hours. The observed differences in Vd and t1/2 reported for TEZ are most likely due to the shorter 
sampling period in the Kaftrio Study 005 (6 days) than in the Symkevi Study 661-101 (4 weeks). 
Presumably, the effective volume of distribution as well as the effective t1/2 are better predicted using 
the relatively shorter sampling period, whereas the terminal t1/2 is likely better estimated using the 
longer sampling period. There are no indications that the TEZ t1/2 or Vd is affected by simultaneous 
administration of VX-445. To avoid confusion upon comparison of the TEZ t1/2 for Symkevi and Kaftrio, 
the effective TEZ t1/2 (11.9 h) as well as the terminal TEZ t1/2 (156 h) is indicated in the SmPC section 
5.2. 
Genetic variants. VX-445 is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. For this enzyme, a relevant and relatively 
abundant variant with reduced activity has been reported, i.e. CYP3A4 *22. No data are available for 
VX-445, however, for TEZ and IVA, also being substrates for CYP3A4, the range of exposures in 
heterozygous CYP3A4*22 was increased by 20% and 11%, respectively, as compared to non-
CYP3A4*22 subjects and comparable results may be expected for VX-445. No data are available for 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 64/65 
 
 
 
homozygous CYP3A4*22 subjects however the effects are expected to be stronger than for the 
heterozygous population. This has been indicated in the SmPC.  
Variability. Overall, VX-445 and M23-445 had a moderate (34%) and high (53%) inter-subject 
variability, respectively. The actual intrasubject variability, based on repeated administrations are 
unknown. However, considering the relatively wide therapeutic margin for Kaftrio, no issues are 
expected regarding the intraindividual variability.  
Hepatic impairment. A large proportion of VX-445 related radioactivity was recovered in faeces (87.3% 
in 14 days), and metabolism plays an important role in the clearance of VX-445. Therefore, hepatic 
function is expected to have an important effect on VX-445 clearance. VX-445 pharmacokinetics has 
not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). In 
Study 007, following multiple doses of VX-445, TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately 
impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had an approximately 25% higher AUC 
and a 12% higher Cmax for VX-445, 73% higher AUC and 70% higher Cmax for M23-445, 20% higher 
AUC but similar Cmax for tezacaftor, 22% lower AUC and 20% lower Cmax for TEZ-M1, and a 1.5-fold 
higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for 
demographics. Based on these data, according to the Applicant, use of VX-445/TEZ/IVA is not 
recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. However, for patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment, considering the high medical need for treatment of CF patients with 
hepatic impairment use of VX-445/TEZ/IVA could be considered when there is a clear medicinal need 
and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, VX-445/TEZ/IVA should be used with 
caution at an approximately 25% reduced dose, as follows: two VX-445/TEZ/IVA tablets alternating 
with one VX-445/TEZ/IVA tablet taken in the morning, on alternate days. The evening dose of the 
ivacaftor tablet should not be taken.  
Although the dose advice for CF patients with moderate hepatic impairment appears reasonable and 
can at this stage be accepted, no information has been provided by the Applicant on the effect of the 
proposed dose-reduction on the exposure to the active metabolite M1-TEZ. The Applicant should 
provide such analysis and subsequently re-discuss/refine the dose-recommendation in moderately 
hepatic impaired patients. This discussion is proposed to be provided at the time that the CSR from 
Study 007 is submitted as Post Approval Measure.  
Age. No subjects over the age of 59 were included in the clinical studies supporting this application. 
Based on extrapolation, no indication for a pronounced difference in VX-445 PK in subjects aged >59 
years was apparent.  
Weight. No relevant effect of weight on VX-445 exposure was observed in CF subjects >40 kg or <90 
kg. The lowest weight included in the POP-PK analyses was 29 kg but there were insufficient data in CF 
subjects <40 kg in the Phase 3 studies to make a conclusion about exposure at lower extremes of 
weight. Further data on PK in low weight patients is expected in due course from the ongoing open 
label PK/safety study (VX18-445-106) in children aged 6-11 years (both F/F and F/MF genotypes), 
where half the adult dose is being tested in patients under 30 kg. 
The results of the exposure-response (PK/PD) model O401 for SwCl and ppFEV1 support the 
hypothesis that the exposures to VX-445 obtained upon administration of a 200mg qd dose is on the 
plateau region of the exposure-response curve for SwCl and ppFEV1 in both F/MF and F/F subjects. In 
addition, this PK/PD analysis shows that the triple VX-445/TEZ/IVA combination therapy caused a 
larger absolute increase in ΔppFEV1 and a larger absolute decrease in SwCl than TEZ/IVA in CF 
subjects with the F/F genotype. 
VX-445 was assessed for QT prolongation as monotherapy. IVA and TEZ have been evaluated 
previously in dedicated thorough QT studies; the results showed that treatment with IVA or TEZ at 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 65/66 
 
 
 
therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses did not have clinically significant effects on QTc. The assessment 
of the mono-component is considered acceptable based on the ICH guideline E14, that states that, in 
general, combinations of two or more drugs are unlikely to need a thorough QT/QTc study or intensive 
late stage monitoring, if the component drugs have been demonstrated to lack relevant effects in 
thorough QT/QTc studies.  
Mean ΔQTcF values were negative at all post-dose time points in the active treatment group. For mean 
ΔQTcF values and mean placebo corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF), the 90% CI did not exceed 10 ms at any 
timepoint. A QTcF effect (ΔΔQTcF) above 10 msec based on the upper bound of the 90% CI can be 
excluded up to a VX-445 plasma concentration of approximately 32.7 μg/mL and up to an M23-445 
plasma concentration of approximately 14.0 μg/ml. These concentrations are approximately 3.7-fold 
and 4.9-fold higher, respectively, than VX-445 and M23-445 Cmax values in subjects with CF following 
VX-445 200 mg qd (8.74 μg/mL and 2.88 μg/mL). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, VX-445, as well as tezacaftor and ivacaftor pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have 
been investigated satisfactorily.  
However, studies have not been conducted with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, patients with 
severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio as indicated in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Kaftrio is not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In these patients, its use 
should only be considered if there is a clear medical need and with caution at a reduced dose as 
mentioned in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The Applicant agreed to submit results of the clinical study report of study 007 in patients with 
moderate impairment as Post Approval Measure (PAM) by end of Q3 2020. At the same time, the 
Applicant should re-discuss/refine the dose-advice in moderate hepatically impaired patients, taking 
into account the expected exposure of the active M1-TEZ metabolite. This information is important in 
support of the dose advice in patients with hepatic impairment. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The VX-445/TEZ/IVA development program was based on in vitro evidence demonstrating increased 
efficacy and potency of the triple combination (TC) regimen on the F508del-CFTR protein compared to 
previous IVA (Kalydeco) monotherapy or lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi) and TEZ/IVA (Symdeko, 
Symkevi) dual therapies. A clinical program was designed to assess whether the presence of a single 
F508del allele would be sufficient for CF patients to benefit from the TC regimen.  
The core efficacy data are from 2 controlled Phase 3 main studies: 
•  Study 102: a 24-week study in subjects with a single F508del allele (F/MF) 
•  Study 103: a 4-week study in subjects with two F508del alleles (F/F) 
Supportive efficacy data are from: 
• 
Phase 1/2 Study 001 in F/MF (Part D) and F/F subjects (Part E) 
•  Study 105, an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating long-term safety and 
efficacy for 96 weeks in subjects who participated in Studies 102 and 103.  
Additionally, results of a European Medicines Agency Paediatric Committee (PDCO)-requested cross-
study comparison using data from Studies 103 and 105 and Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA (Symkevi) 
Assessment report

provide supportive efficacy data. This comparison is also referred to as the Meta-analysis (paediatric

Study 001 (Parts D and E) was a Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group, 
multicentre study in F/MF and F/F subjects 18 years of age and older. The study evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy and safety of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
combination. 
• 
• 
In Part D, F/MF subjects received the triple combination (TC) of VX-445 (either 50, 100, or 200 
mg once daily [qd]) with TEZ/IVA (or placebo) for 4 weeks, followed by TEZ/IVA (or placebo) 
only for 1 week (VX-445 Washout Period).  
In Part E, F/F subjects received TEZ/IVA for 4 weeks during the Run-in Period, followed by the 
TC of VX-445 200 mg qd with TEZ/IVA (or placebo + TEZ/IVA) for 4 weeks, followed by 
TEZ/IVA only for 4 weeks (VX-445 Washout Period). 
A total of 123 subjects were enrolled in Parts D, E, and F. Part D was enrolled as 2 sequential cohorts. 
Subjects in Part D1 and D2 were pooled for analysis purposes and are summarized together in this

Since the dose range in the CF patients was limited (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg qd), simulations 
were conducted to extrapolate the VX-445 dose beyond the range of 50 to 200 mg in order to visualize 
the effect on ppFEV1 or SwCl. Results of the simulations (for ppFEV1 and SwCL) are also displayed in 
Figure 6 and Figure 7, where TEZ/IVA treatment corresponds to a 0-mg dose of VX-445.

Overall, the results of study 001, the dose-response and the exposure-response analyses show that 
the triple VX-445/TEZ/IVA combination therapy caused a larger absolute increase in ΔppFEV1 and a 
larger absolute decrease in SwCl than placebo in F/MF and TEZ/IVA in F/F CF patients. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two main studies have been presented in this application as follows: 
Study VX17-445-102: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study Evaluating the 
Efficacy and Safety of VX-445 Combination Therapy in Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis Who Are 
Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation and a Minimal Function Mutation (F/MF). 
Study VX17-445-103: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled Study Evaluating the 
Efficacy and Safety of VX-445 Combination Therapy in Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis Who Are 
Homozygous for the F508del Mutation (F/F). 
Methods 
Study VX17-445-102 
Subjects with F/MF genotypes were randomized (1:1) to either VX-445/TEZ/IVA or placebo (Figure 7).

Study VX17-445-103 
After a 4-week TEZ/IVA Run-in Period to establish an on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for comparison 
with the Treatment Period, subjects with the F/F genotype were randomized (1:1) to either 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA or TEZ/IVA (Figure 8). Randomization was stratified by ppFEV1 determined during the 
TEZ/IVA Run-in Period (<70 versus ≥70) and by age (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) at screening.

(105) 
Study Participants  
The key inclusion criteria were in both studies, aged 12 years and older, FEV1 value ≥40% and ≤90% 
of predicted mean for age, sex, and height, a confirmed diagnosis of CF by the investigator and stable 
CF disease as judged by the investigator. 
Study 102 included patients heterozygous for F508del and an MF mutation (F/MF). The eligible MF 
mutations were pre-specified. Previous clinical studies of TEZ/IVA and LUM/IVA in F/MF patients have 
failed to demonstrate efficacy.  
MF mutations on that list were determined by the applicant to qualify as an MF mutation if meeting one 
of the following 2 criteria:  
(1) biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete absence of 
CFTR protein), or 
(2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA, and evidence of 
clinical severity on a population basis (as reported in large patient registries).  
Inclusion of MF Mutations Based on In Vitro Testing 
Mutations that were considered to be MF mutations based on in vitro testing met the following criteria 
in in vitro experiments: 
• baseline chloride transport that was <10% of wildtype CFTR 
• an increase in chloride transport of <10% over baseline following the addition of TEZ, IVA, or 
TEZ/IVA in the assay 
These mutations also had evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (per CFTR2 patient 
registry; accessed on 15 February 2016). Patients with these mutations on one allele and F508del on 
the other allele exhibited evidence of clinical severity as defined as: 
• average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, and 
• prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50% 
These clinical severity criteria do not apply to the individual subjects to be enrolled in the study but 
were used to categorize each mutation on a population level. 
Eligible MF Mutations 
The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by an FDA-cleared 
genotyping assay or other method (e.g., sequencing); however, this list may not include every 
eligible mutation, and investigators should contact the medical monitor regarding other 
mutations that may also meet study eligibility criteria.

Study 103 included patients homozygous for F508del (F/F). Although currently approved CFTR 
modulator therapies are available for F/F patients, these patients continue to have progressive lung 
disease. 
The main exclusion criteria were similar in both trials, being:  
1.  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: 
a.  Hemoglobin <10 g/dL 
b.  Total bilirubin ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
c.  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥3 × ULN 
d.  Abnormal renal function defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation) for subjects ≥
18 years of age and ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the Counahan-Barratt 
equation) for subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive) 
2.  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation (PEx), or changes in 
therapy (including antibiotics) for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the first dose of 
study drug (Day 1, study 102) or before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in the Run-in Period (Day -
28, Study 103) 
3.  Lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status 
(including, but not limited to, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and 
Mycobacterium abscessus). For subjects who had a history of a positive culture, the 
investigator applied the following criteria to establish whether the subject was free of infection 
with such organisms: 
a.  The subject did not have a respiratory tract culture positive for these organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent. 
b.  The subject had at least 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for such organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent, with the first and last of these 
separated by at least 3 months, and the most recent one within the 6 months before 
the date of informed consent.

aThe TEZ/IVA dosages for the control group were the same as those used in the TC regimen (the commercial 
doses of TEZ and IVA). 
Study drug was taken within 30 minutes of the start of a fat-containing meal or snack, such as a 
standard “CF” meal or snack or a standard meal. 
For both studies use of any other CFTR modulator therapy for the study duration was not permitted. 
For Study 102 use of CFTR modulators needed to be stopped at least 28 days before the first dose of 
study drug on Day 1.  
For Study 103 patients taking Vertex CFTR modulators right up to the time of screening could be 
recruited, and they only needed to stop these modulators at the start of the TEZ/IVA run-in period.  
The patients on non-Vertex CFTR modulators had to have a wash out period pre-screening.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and secondary efficacy and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints evaluated in Studies 102 
and 103 are provided in Table 8. 
In Study 102, the primary endpoint in the global protocol was absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 at Week 4. Subsequently, the CHMP requested a primary endpoint of absolute change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24, thus a Europe-specific protocol amendment was made to 
accommodate the request.

For the F/F population, endpoints that require a longer follow-up than 4 weeks were assessed in the 
open-label extension of the study: study 105 (i.e., pulmonary exacerbations [PEx], body mass index 
[BMI], and weight). 
Spirometry was performed according to the internationally recognized American Thoracic Society 
Guidelines/European Respiratory Society Guidelines.5 
The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) was used to capture and evaluate the impact of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA on patient-reported respiratory symptoms and other aspects of health-related quality of 
life. In children of 12 and 13 years of age (at baseline) the CFQ-R for children was used, and a CFQ-R 
for Parents/Caregivers version. 
PEx was defined as a clinical deterioration in respiratory status necessitating a change in antibiotic 
therapy (intravenous [IV], inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of the following signs or symptoms: 
change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough; increased dyspnoea; malaise, 
fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38°C (equivalent to approximately 100.4°F); anorexia or 
weight loss; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; change in physical examination of 
the chest; decrease in lung function by at least 10%; or radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary 
infection. 
Sample size 
Study 102 (F/MF) 
Power calculations were based on 180 subjects and a 10% dropout rate in each treatment group at the 
final analysis and 70 subjects and a 5% dropout rate in each group at the IA.

For the primary endpoint of mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 4, assuming a 
within group SD of 7 percentage points, the study was estimated to have approximately 98% power at 
the IA and approximately 99% power at the final analysis to detect a treatment difference of 5.0 
percentage points, with a 2 sided alpha of 0.044 and 0.01, respectively, at the IA and final analysis.  
For the key secondary endpoint of number of PEx through Week 24, the sample size of 180 subjects 
per group was estimated to have approximately 80% power to detect a 40% reduction in PEx rate for 
the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to the placebo group, assuming a PEx rate for the placebo group 
of 0.6 over 24 weeks. 
Study 103 (F/F) 
Power calculations were based on 100 subjects and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4.  
For the primary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 4, assuming a within-
group SD of 7 percentage points, this study with 100 subjects was estimated to have approximately 
93% power to detect a difference of 5.0 percentage points for the primary endpoint, with a 2-sided 
alpha of 0.05. 
Randomisation 
For Study 102 (F/MF), subjects with F/MF genotypes were randomized (1:1) to either VX 
445/TEZ/IVA or placebo. Randomization was stratified by percent predicted forced expiratory volume 
in 1 second (ppFEV1) determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening 
Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus female). 
For Study 103 (F/F), subjects with the F/F genotype were randomized (1:1) to either VX 445/TEZ/IVA 
or TEZ/IVA. Randomization was stratified by ppFEV1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period 
(<70 versus ≥70) and by age (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
For study 102 (F/MF) and study 103 (F/F), all subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site 
personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the 
Vertex study team were blinded to the treatment codes until the final database lock, with the following 
main exceptions: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in the 
event of a life-threatening medical emergency or to ensure the safety of the subject and her foetus in 
the event of a pregnancy. 
• For SAE processing and reporting regulations, for preparing the final (production) randomization list 
and for preparing the unblinded analysis for the IDMC. 
• Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analysing PK samples and the Vertex Bioanalytical 
personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the Bioanalytical CRO.  
For study 102 only: 
• Vendor for modelling and simulations performing population PK modelling in preparation for 
regulatory submission(s). For the purpose of regulatory submissions in certain regions, a limited 
Vertex team may be unblinded to the IA results. The IA was performed by an external independent 
biostatistician who was not involved in and did not influence study conduct. The analyses generated by 
the external independent biostatistician were reviewed by the IDMC. Only after the IDMC declared that 
the study had crossed the prespecified efficacy boundary was the study unblinded by a limited Vertex

team to prepare a regulatory submission. Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be 
involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the 
study. 
Statistical methods 
For study 102, the Applicant describes two protocols: The Global protocol and the European protocol. 
The difference between these two protocols is that the primary efficacy endpoint for the global protocol 
was evaluated at 4 weeks, while for the European protocol, relevant to the current assessment, the 
primary endpoint was evaluated at 24 weeks. For the description of the statistical methods, the 
information from the global protocol will be used with any differences relevant to European assessment 
identified. In both studies (102 and 103), analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of absolute change 
from baseline in ppFEV1 was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). 
A similar MMRM was used for all key secondary endpoints with the exception of the number of PEx (in 
Study 102) which used a negative binomial regression model.  
An underlying assumption of the MMRM method is that data are missing at random. To minimize the 
amount of missing data, subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment were continued 
to be followed up for all scheduled study visits for spirometry and other efficacy assessments. To 
assess the impact of missing data and the assumption that data are missing at random, a multiple 
imputation algorithm was planned to be used if ≥10% of the subjects had missing change in 
ppFEV1 at Week 24 in any treatment group. In this case, missing absolute change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 assessments will be imputed starting from the first visit with missing values, for which all 
subsequent visits through Week 24 are also missing. For intermediate missing data, i.e., missing 
values that fall between two non-missing ones, it is reasonable to assume that they are missing at 
random and therefore will not be imputed. An MMRM analogous to that for the primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be applied to imputed datasets and the relevant MI 
estimators will be reported. 
Multiple Imputation will be dependent on classification of randomized subjects into one of three 
categories based on the following rules:  
•  Non-missing category: Subjects who have a percent predicted FEV1 assessment at Week 24 
(i.e., subjects who have a non-missing absolute change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 at Week 24).  
•  Missing category 1: Subjects with missing absolute change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 at Week 24, who discontinued treatment because of adverse events, non-compliance 
with study drug, death, or physician decision, or because the subject refused further dosing or 
required prohibited medication. 
•  Missing category 2: Subjects who discontinued treatment for any reason not listed in Category 
1 and have missing absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 24, or subjects who 
have completed 24 weeks treatment duration but are missing the absolute change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 at visit Week 24. 
Control of Overall Type I Error and Testing Hierarchy 
Studies 102 and 103 each included a hierarchical testing procedure to control the type I error rate for 
the multiple key secondary endpoints which were tested at an alpha of 0.05. For a test at any step to 
be considered statistically significant within the testing hierarchy, it must have been statistically 
significant, and all previous tests (if any) within the hierarchy must have been statistically significant 
at the 0.05 level.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 79/80 
 
 
 
 
In the global protocol of Study 102, an interim analysis (IA) was planned for the testing of absolute 
change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 4. For this, a Lan and DeMets alpha spending function was 
applied such that an alpha of 0.01 was preserved for the final analysis. Because all subjects were 
included in the IA, the information fraction was 100% and thus, the primary endpoint was tested at an 
alpha of 0.05 during the IA. This IA was not relevant to the European protocol because the primary 
endpoint for the European protocol regarded change through week 24.  
Results 
Participant flow 
In study 102 (F/MF), of the 403 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 3 (0.7%) 
subjects (all in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group) prematurely discontinued treatment (2 due to an AE, 1 due 
to a pregnancy). A total of 13 (3.2%) had an important protocol deviation (IPD), related to prohibited 
medication, acute illness, safety assessment and study drug. 
The following analysis sets are defined:  
All Subjects Set: all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose of study drug;  
FAS: all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutations and received at least 1 
dose of study drug;  
iFAS: all subjects in the FAS whose scheduled Week 4 Visit was on or before the IA data cut-off date; 
Safety Set: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug

For both studies overall compliance was high. In Study 102, 98% of the treatment group, and 99.5% 
of the placebo group had a compliance rate of over 80%. In Study 103 all patients in both groups had 
a compliance rate of 80% or more.  
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
For study 102 and 103, the demographic and baseline characteristics are provided in Table 14 and 
Table 15, respectively. In general, the demographic and baseline characteristics are balanced between 
the two treatment groups. 
Concomitant medications 
The most common concomitant medications (continued and newly received) were medications typically 
used for management of CF.  
For study 102, three antibiotic treatments were used more often in the placebo group. Tobramycin 
was used in 55.7% in the Placebo group and 39% in the active group. Ciprofloxacin was used in 35% 
in the placebo group and 16% of the active group. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were used in 
26.1% of the placebo group and 17.0% of the active group.

Numbers analysed 
The efficacy analyses of study 102 (n=403) and 103 (n=107) were performed on the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS): all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutations and have received at 
least 1 dose of study drug.  
The modified FAS (m-FAS) excluded patients that did not meet the eligibility criteria or with significant 
deviations of study drug administration. In study 102, 2 patients were excluded (from placebo arm 
only) for the m-FAS and 8 patients (5 placebos, 3 active arm) were excluded from the mFAS analysis 
of SwCl (pre-dose SwCl value <60.0 mmol/L). In 103, no m-FAS analysis was performed, as all 
patients met the criteria. 
From study 102, all 400 patients that complete dosing rolled over to the open-label study (Study 105). 
From study 103, all 107 patients rolled over to the open-label study (Study 105). 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
Primary endpoint – Absolute change in ppFEV1 
In Study 102, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in ppFEV1 through Week 24 compared to placebo, with a treatment difference of 14.3 
percentage points (P<0.0001). Improvements in ppFEV1 were already seen at week 4 (secondary 
endpoints), with a statistically significant treatment difference of 13.7 percentage points (p<0.0001)  
(Table 17 and Figure 9). 
In Study 103, following a 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in absolute change in ppFEV1 at Week 4 
compared to TEZ/IVA, with a treatment difference of 10.0 percentage points (p<0.0001) (Table 18  
and Figure 10).

•  Key secondary endpoint – SwCl 
In Study 102, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in SwCl through Week 24 with a treatment difference of -41.8 mmol/L (p<0.0001) 
compared to placebo (Table 19 and Figure 11).  
In Study 103, following a 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in, statistically, significant improvements were also 
observed at Week 4 with a treatment difference of -45.1 mmol/L for VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to 
TEZ/IVA (p<0.0001) (Table 20 and Figure 12).

•  Key secondary endpoint – Respiratory Symptoms 
In Study 102, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
absolute change in CFQ-R RD score through Week 24 with a treatment difference of 20.2 points 
(p<0.0001) compared to placebo Table 21).  
In Study 103, statistically significant improvements were also observed at Week 4 with a treatment 
difference of 17.4 points for VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus TEZ/IVA (p<0.0001) (Table 22).

•  Key secondary endpoint – Pulmonary Exacerbations (only study 102) 
In Study 102, VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant reduction in PEx through Week 24, 
with a PEx rate that was 63% lower in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than the placebo group (rate ratio = 
0.37 [p<0.0001; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55]). The annual event rate was 0.37 in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
versus 0.98 in the placebo group.  
Analysis of time-to-first PEx through Week 24 showed that a greater proportion of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group remained free of PEx than the proportion of subjects in the placebo group. The risk 
of a PEx is reduced when treated with the triple combination (HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; 
p<0.0001).

•  Key secondary endpoint – Nutritional status (only study 102) 
In Study 102, statistically significant improvements were observed for absolute change from baseline 
in BMI, with a treatment difference of 1.04 kg/m2 (p<0.0001) for VX-445/TEZ/IVA versus placebo at 
Week 24. Substantial improvements were also observed for absolute change from baseline in BMI z-
score and body weight at Week 24, with a treatment difference in BMI z-score of 0.30 (nominal 
P<0.0001) and a treatment difference in body weight of 2.9 kg (nominal p<0.0001) for VX-
445/TEZ/IVA versus placebo (Table 24).  
For subject included in study 103, results on nutritional status will be displayed at study 105.

Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy subsets (m-FAS) 
For study 102, results from the M-FAS were consistent with the analysis performed by the FAS.  
For study 103, no analyses were done using subset of subjects in the FAS. 
Subgroup analyses 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline were performed in a 
manner similar to that of the primary analysis. For both studies, the results of the subgroup analyses 
were consistent with the results of the primary analyses. Due to the small size of study 103, some 
subgroups have a limited number of subjects (Figure 13 and Figure 14).

To further explore the Applicant’ hypothesis that a single F508del allele is sufficient to provide 
substantial clinical efficacy, an ad hoc analysis was performed to assess outcomes in F/MF subjects in 
Study 102 with a Class I MF mutation (n = 314, ~78% of the overall study population) (criterion 1) 
and patients not responding in vitro to IVA or TEZ/IVA (missense or in-frame deletion, criterion 2). 
Treatment of these subjects with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in an absolute change from baseline in 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

ppFEV1 through Week 24 of 14.8 percentage points when compared to placebo for patient included 
based on criterion 1 and of 12.9 percentage points for patients included based on criterion 2.  
The outcome of this analysis was similar to the overall study outcome (14.3 percentage points)  
(See Table 25).

through Week 24 by Genotype (FAS) 
Source: Ad hoc Table 14.2.8.11 
In addition, the Applicant further subdivided these subgroups, and provided post-hoc analyses in the 
subgroups. For the Class I (criterion 1) mutations, a subdivision was made for Nonsense mutations, 
Canonical splice mutations and insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift. For missense and in-frame 
deletions (criterion 2) a subdivision was made for mutations that were responsive or not to the triple   
therapy. The outcome of this analyses was similar to the overall study outcome.

Analysis description  Ancillary analysis 
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
effect for VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. 
Analysis performed across trials (meta-analysis) 
A PDCO-requested cross-study comparison (PIP Study C9 Meta-analysis) was performed to provide at 
least 24 weeks of comparative efficacy data for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA regimens in F/F 
subjects.  
This cross-study comparison included data from  
•  2 studies evaluating VX-445/TEZ/IVA (Studies 103 and OLE 105) and  
•  2 studies evaluating TEZ/IVA (Studies 661-106 and OLE 661-110) (used to support the MA for 
TEZ/IVA in F/F patients).  
Baseline in Study 103 was defined after 4 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA (TEZ/IVA Run-in Period). 
In contrast, baseline in Study 661-106 was defined relative to a period without CFTR modulator 
treatment. To enable a comparison of efficacy, the first 4 weeks of TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 661-
106 were considered a nominal TEZ/IVA Run-in Period to match the 4-week TEZ/IVA Run-in Period in 
Study 103. As a result, baseline values of efficacy endpoints for subjects in Study 661-106 were re-
derived as measured at the Week 4 Visit (Figure 15).

Figure 15: Meta-analysis baseline and analysis period for efficacy endpoints 
For the efficacy analysis, subjects from the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in Study 103 and the TEZ/IVA 
group in Study 106 were compared; the control groups i.e. TEZ/IVA group in Study 103 and the 
placebo group in Study 106 were not included. 
Overall the demographics and baseline characteristics of subjects in the meta-analysis were very 
similar between the VX-445/TEZ/IVA patients and the TEZ/IVA patients in terms of age, sex, baseline 
ppFEV1, and baseline SwCl. In terms of the numbers analysed for the efficacy analysis, 55 were 
included from the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 246 from the TEZ/IVA group in the FAS.  
Following the 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in, treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 24 weeks in F/F 
subjects resulted in robust and clinically meaningful improvements in pulmonary and non-pulmonary 
endpoints. Statistically significant improvements in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to the 
TEZ/IVA group were observed for ppFEV1 through 28 weeks of treatment (10.7 percentage points), 
PEx rate (55% reduction), SwCl (-43.8 mmol/L), CFQ-R RD score (16.5 points), and BMI (1.19 
kg/m2). These results provide further support for the superiority of VX 445/TEZ/IVA versus TEZ/IVA. 
Responder analysis performed across trials 
Analysis Methods 
Responder analyses for ppFEV1 were conducted using data from 7 pivotal Phase 3 studies of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA (Studies 102 and 103), TEZ/IVA (Studies 661-106 and 661-108), or IVA (Studies 770-
102, 770-110, and 770-111). An individual subject in Study 102 was classified as a responder based 
on 2 different thresholds, either ppFEV1 ≥2.5 or ≥5.0 percentage points, if the average of Week 4, 
Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 24 is greater than or equal to 2.5 or 5.0, respectively. 
Subjects in whom all Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 24 ppFEV1 data were missing 
were classified as non-responders. An individual subject in Study 103 was classified as a responder in 
a similar fashion, using absolute change from base in ppFEV1 at Week 4. Because of the difference in 
study design, the baseline in Study 103 is defined after the 4-week TEZ/IVA run-in; thus, caution 
should be taken when comparing Study 103 versus other studies. The responders for TEZ/IVA or IVA 
studies are defined similarly to Study 102, based on the primary ppFEV1 endpoint. 
The number and percentage of subjects who had improvements in ppFEV1 of ≥2.5 and ≥5.0 
percentage points are summarized in Table 30. To account for differences in study populations, the 
placebo-adjusted proportion of subjects with improvements in ppFEV1 of ≥2.5 and ≥5.0 percentage 
points was calculated as the mathematical difference between the percentage of responders in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 101/102 
 
 
 
 
active treatment group and the placebo group (with the exception of Study 103, which was adjusted 
using the TEZ/IVA comparator group as there was no placebo group in that study). 
Results 
These analyses show that a larger proportion of subjects responded to VX445/TEZ/IVA treatment 
versus placebo in Study 102 than in the pivotal studies for TEZ/IVA and IVA. This is consistent with the 
substantial magnitude of benefit observed with VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
F/G and F/RF patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA will benefit from fully leveraging both alleles. For 
the reasons outlined above, a greater proportion of F/G and F/RF patients will respond to VX-
445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA and IVA, respectively.

Real world Data 
Upon request from CHMP, the applicant provided additional information from the US Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) on F/MF, F/F, F/G and F/RF patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
in the post-authorization setting.   
Data collected by the CFFPR were provided to the Applicant as aggregate data report(s) only. Because 
the CFFPR is governed by the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the applicant does not have access to 
patient-level data in the registry.  
F/MF and F/F 
Population 
CF patients who met the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) had a CFFPR record of 
initiating treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019, (2) were 
aged 12 years and older on the date of treatment initiation, (3) had a F/MF or F/F genotype, and (4) 
had ppFEV1 assessments available both within 90 days before (baseline) and any time after (follow-
up) treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. F/MF subjects included in this analysis had MF 
mutations that were defined consistently with those in Study 102.

The analysis population is summarized in Figure 16 below. 
Figure 16: Patient population included in the CFFPR analyses 
Individual patient-level genotype data for the analysis population were not available in this data cut. 
From 21 October 2019 through 31 December 2019, a total of 1,448 F/MF and 3,178 F/F patients had a 
record of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation in CFFPR; of those patients, 995 (68.7%) and 2,200 
(69.2%) respectively had lung function measurements available both at baseline and follow-up and 
were included in these analyses. 
Outcomes and Data Analysis 
Improvement in lung function, as assessed by ppFEV1 (calculated using Global Lung Initiative 
standards [Quanjer et al 2012]), was used to determine the treatment effect with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 
Other efficacy parameters (e.g., SwCl, CFQ-R) are not routinely collected in the clinical practice and/or 
not captured in the CFFPR and thus were not evaluated in this analysis. 
The most recent measurement obtained within 90 days before VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation 
served as the baseline value. The last measurement available in the period following therapy initiation 
on or before 15 March 2020 served as the follow-up value. The change in ppFEV1 was calculated as a 
difference between the follow-up and baseline value for each patient, and data were summarized for 
F/MF and F/F subgroups using summary statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], 95% confidence 
intervals [CI]). 
Patients who were initiated on VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment in 2019 were followed from the date of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. Treatment duration was calculated for each 
patient as the difference in days between the date of treatment initiation and the date of the last 
available post-treatment ppFEV1. Mean treatment durations were calculated for the F/MF and F/F 
subgroups separately. 
Mean patient age at the time of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation was summarized for the F/MF and 
F/F subgroups separately. 
Recent use of CFTR modulator therapy prior to VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation was defined as 
any record in the registry of exposure to CFTR modulator therapy in 2019 prior to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
treatment initiation date; the actual CFTR modulator therapy used prior to VX-445/TEZ/IVA was not 
available in this data cut. Precise start and stop dates for LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA are not available in the 
CFFPR and the exposure status was determined based on the presence or absence of the treatment 
record at each patient encounter. In 2019, in anticipation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA, CFFPR introduced a new 
data collection element to capture the approximate date the patient started taking therapy, which 
allowed more precise estimation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA initiation date in this analysis.

Results 
The F/MF patients had a mean age of 26.3 years and a mean treatment duration of 65.6 days. The F/F 
patients had a mean age of 26.7 years and a mean treatment duration of 65.4 days. 
As expected, based on the market availability of CFTR modulators indicated for patients with F/F 
genotype (LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA), the vast majority of the F/F patients included in this analysis were 
receiving CFTR modulator therapy prior to initiating VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment (91.5% were exposed 
to at least one other CFTR modulator in 2019). In contrast, consistent with the lack of approved CFTR 
modulator therapy for the F/MF population, only 2.9% of F/MF patients had a record of receiving CFTR 
modulator therapy prior to initiating VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
Mean baseline ppFEV1 values were 65.7 for the F/MF patients and 65.8 for the F/F patients. An 
improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline was observed for both genotype groups: mean of 10.9 
percentage points (95% CI: 10.0, 11.8) for the F/MF patients and 9.0 percentage points (95% CI: 8.6, 
9.4) for the F/F patients (Table 17 and Table 18). 
The data from CFFPR in F/MF and F/F patients demonstrate the transformational benefit of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA in these patients. The results are consistent with results from the pivotal clinical studies 
in F/MF and F/F (Table 32).

Population 
CF patients who met the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) had a CFFPR record of 
initiating treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019, (2) were 
aged 12 years and older on the date of treatment initiation, (3) had a F/G or F/RF genotype, and (4) 
had ppFEV1 assessments available both within 90 days before (baseline) and any time after (follow-
up) treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. The gating and RF mutations included were consistent 
with the eligible population in Study 104, and reflect the gating mutations for which Kalydeco is 
indicated and the RF mutations for which both Kalydeco and Symdeko (Symkevi) are indicated in the 
US.

Individual patient-level genotype data for the analysis population were not available in this data cut. 
From 21 October 2019 through 31 December 2019, a total of 521 F/G or F/RF patients had a record of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation in CFFPR. Of these patients, 297 patients (57%) had lung function 
measurements available both at baseline and follow-up and were included in these analyses. 
Results 
Their mean treatment duration was 63.4 days. Of these patients, there were 136 F/G patients who had 
a mean age of 32.3 years and a mean treatment duration of 62.8 days. There were 161 F/RF patients 
who had a mean age of 40.3 years and a mean treatment duration of 63.8 days. As expected, based 
on the market availability of CFTR modulators indicated for patients with gating (IVA) and RF (IVA, 
TEZ/IVA) mutations, the vast majority of the F/G and F/RF patients included in this analysis were 
receiving CFTR modulator therapy prior to initiating VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment (97.8% of F/G patients 
and 89.4% F/RF patients were exposed to at least one other CFTR modulator in 2019). 
Mean baseline ppFEV1 values were 69.0 for the F/G patients and 66.6 for the F/RF patients. An 
improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline was observed for both genotype groups: mean of 4.3 
percentage points (95% CI: 2.7, 5.9) for the F/G patients, and 2.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.7, 
3.7) for the F/RF patients (Table 33). 
Table 33: CFFPR data for F/G and F/RF patients 
Clinical studies in special populations 
All trials included adolescents and adults. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed 
using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed consistent changes 
in ppFEV1 regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function, geographic region, prior use of common CF 
medications, and P. aeruginosa colonization.  
Studies 102 and 103 excluded pregnant and lactating women, and also excluded subjects with a 
history of any illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an additional safety risk 
(e.g. clinically significant hepatic cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension). 
Both studies did not include any patients aged 65 years and older; thus, it is not known whether they 
respond differently from adults who are younger than 65 years of age.

Supportive study 
VX17-445-105 
Open-label extension study in subjects that completed study treatment in study 102 and 
103.  
Subjects who completed Studies 102 (n=400) and 103 (n=107) and met all eligibility criteria were 
eligible to enrol in OLE Study 105. All subjects receive the same dose of VX 445/TEZ/IVA as the VX 
445/TEZ/IVA arms of Studies 102 and 103. The treatment duration in Study 105 is 96 weeks. This 
duration is considered sufficient for the evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy. 
The primary objective of Study 105 is safety. The secondary efficacy endpoints in Study 105 are 
similar to Studies 102 and 103 (e.g. ppFEV1, PEx, SwCL, CFQ-R RD, BMI). 
Updated Interim Analysis study data (IA2) were provided for F/MF (study 102) and F/F subjects (study 
103) through the data cut-off date of 31 October 2019 from Study 105.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
VX 445 (elexacaftor) is a new-generation CFTR corrector, which facilitates the cellular processing and 
trafficking of CFTR. Elexacaftor has a different chemical structure and a different mechanism of action 
compared to the first-generation of CFTR correctors (TEZ, LUM) and potentiators (IVA). 
The Applicant initially applied for the following indication:  
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
There is no other currently approved CFTR modulator therapy in the EU with such a broad indication 
requiring only the presence of one F508del allele, and with the potential to treat such a large 
percentage of the CF population (80-90%). The initially proposed indication includes patients with 
F508del and a so called ‘minimal function’ mutation i.e. F/MF genotypes, a group which has not 
responded to the currently approved CFTR modulating options. It also includes patients with the F/F 
genotype, as well as patients with F/G (F508del with a gating mutation) and F/RF (F508del with a 
residual function mutation) genotypes. Essentially the argument of the applicant is that this triple drug 
combination targets and exerts its effect entirely by correcting the CFTR defect caused by the F508del 
allele, regardless of the second allele present, and sees this as a new treatment approach. This 
F508del-only hypothesis may be a plausible and clinically applicable model for treatment; however, 
uncertainties remain precluding definite conclusion. Details are provided below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 112/113 
 
 
 
 
 
Design and conduct of the studies 
Dosing of VX-445 was investigated in one Phase 1/2 study (Study 001). In healthy volunteers, single 
and multiple ascending doses were tested ranging from 20 mg – 340 mg per dose. In F/MF patients, 
different doses (50mg, 100mg and 200mg) daily were tested while in F/F patients, only the final 
200mg dose was tested.  
Efficacy and safety have been evaluated in three phase 3 studies in CF patients aged 12 years and 
older. Study 102 in subjects heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) and 
study 103 in subjects homozygous for F508del (F/F) are the core efficacy studies. These studies were 
randomised double-blind, controlled multicentre studies. Study 105 was designed to support 
persistence of efficacy and long-term safety. Results are currently submitted as an interim analysis 
(IA2). The study is ongoing and further analyses will be submitted post approval. 
Furthermore, upon request by PDCO, a cross-study comparison “the Meta-analysis”, was performed in 
which the results of Studies 103 and 105 and the phase 3 studies for Symkevi (studies 106 and 110) 
were pooled and compared.  
Upon request by CHMP, real world data (from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 
CFFPR) from a post-authorization setting were also provided. 
Comparator  
In the F/MF patient population (study 001 and 102), placebo was used as the comparator. This is 
considered to be an acceptable treatment arm because no other approved regimens have shown 
clinical efficacy in the F/MF populations, justifying the absence of TEZ/IVA or LUM/IVA arm.  
In the F/F population (study 001 and 103), TEZ/IVA was used as the comparator, in patients already 
treated with TEZ/IVA. This is also considered acceptable because it is the best approved regimen in the 
F/F population.  
The choice of only placebo in F/MF or TEZ/IVA in F/F as a comparator can be questioned. According to 
the applicant, the added effect of VX-445/TEZ/IVA over VX-445 monotherapy or VX-445/IVA is 
demonstrated by in vitro and mechanistic data. These data suggest that the triple combination 
provides additional benefit over all mono/dual therapies in both F/MF and F/F cells. The applicant also 
indicated that TEZ and VX-445 can bind simultaneously to the CFTR protein (only wild-type CFTR 
tested). Nevertheless, clinical evaluation of VX-445 monotherapy and VX-445/IVA compared with the 
TC, was strongly recommended in Scientific Advices (SA) given by CHMP and national authorities. This 
is also in line with the recommendations provided in the Guideline for Fixed Dose Combinations 
(EMA/CHMP/158268/2017) which states that “clinical trials demonstrating efficacy/safety of the new 
active substance as monotherapy” should be performed. While information on the safety of VX-445 can 
be derived from the currently provided and previously submitted clinical studies performed with 
placebo and TEZ/IVA; it is considered that clinical efficacy data would be required, in particular, 
compared to the VX-445/IVA combination. It is considered however that in vitro results, confirming the 
added benefit of the combination of two correctors (VX-445 and TEZ) over VX-445 alone provides 
valuable information and demonstrates that both correctors VX-445 and TEZ are required in 
combination with potentiator (IVA). 
The HBE cells used to generate in vitro data can be regarded as a relevant model system to study the 
pharmacological action of CFTR modulators. Three donors with an F/F genotype were analysed and 4 
donors with an F/MF genotype (2x G452X (non-sense); 3905InsT (small insertion); E585X (non-
sense). In study 102; 65, 5 and one patient with this genotype were included respectively.

The in vitro data demonstrate that: 
- 
The combinations of TEZ and VX-445 (with or without IVA) results in increased processing and 
trafficking of CFTR protein to the membrane compared to monotherapy VX-445 or VX-445/IVA. 
An added benefit (minimal 20% - maximal 60%) of VX-445/TEZ/IVA is seen in all donors on chloride 
transport for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA combination compared to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Symkevi, VX-
445 alone, VX-445 & ivacaftor and VX-445 & tezacaftor in F/MF (4 donors) and F/F cells (3 donors).  
-  VX-445 and TEZ can bind simultaneously to a thermostabilized variant of CFTR. 
The in vitro data suggest that the triple combination does provide a benefit over all mono and dual 
combination of VX-445, TEZ and IVA in all tested donors. 
Uncertainties remain on the contribution of all components, as not all combination are tested in a 
clinical setting and the FDC guideline is not followed. Nevertheless, the in vitro data, the highly 
clinically relevant benefit and well-tolerated safety profile of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA in the F/MF and F/F 
population are considered relevant enough to outweigh these uncertainties on the contribution of the 
mono-components in a clinical setting.  
Duration 
The duration of the dose finding study 001 of 28 days is acceptable for the objective. The 24-week 
treatment period of pivotal study 102 is in line with the EMA guideline on CF and according to CHMP’s 
SA. However, the 4-week treatment period of pivotal study 103 is not in line with guidelines and SA 
given, and robust conclusion cannot be drawn on the sustainability of the effect of the triple 
combination. In the view of the Applicant, the short duration is acceptable because a sustained benefit 
from day 15 towards week 24 has always been shown in clinical studies of the other CFTR modifiers. 
Although this has indeed been observed, the results from the in between time were fluctuating and not 
completely stable. Furthermore, important efficacy parameters such as exacerbations and BMI cannot 
be reliably measured in a study with a duration of 4 weeks. Therefore, a 4-week study is too short to 
establish a long-term clinical benefit. The open label extension phase (Study 105) provides further 
data on the maintenance of efficacy and long-term safety, which is considered acceptable. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
The in-and exclusion criteria for the dose-response study 001, and pivotal studies 102 and 103 were 
largely similar, except for age (dose response only adult patients, pivotal also adolescents) and the 
genotype mutations. Patients had to have FEV1 ≥40% and ≤ 90% and stable CF. Diagnosis of CF was 
confirmed by the investigator. In previous trials, the CF diagnosis was confirmed by a sweat chloride 
value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis, or when this 60 mmol/L was not met a 
patient must have had documented evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease manifested (for milder 
phenotypes of CF (genotype F/RF). In the current studies, no pre-specified criteria exist for the CF 
diagnosis. Only a limited number of patients with a SwCl of < 60 mmol/L were included in the trial 102 
(and sensitivity analysis without these patients show consistent results). No patients with a SwCl of 
< 60 mmol/L at baseline were included in study 103. 
F/F and F/MF population 
In study 102 the definition of an MF mutation used by the applicant is considered to be unusual. The 
Applicant defines an MF mutation as follows:  
(1) no CFTR protein or (2) a CFTR protein that is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro. For study 
102 a mutation was considered an MF mutation if it meets at least 1 of the following 2 criteria: 
(1) biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete absence of 
CFTR protein). A list of eligible MF mutations was specified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 114/115 
 
 
 
(2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA, and evidence of 
clinical severity on a population basis (as reported in large patient registries). 
• 
In vitro baseline chloride transport of < 10% of WT CFTR and increase of chloride transport 
<10% over baseline after TEZ, IVA or TEZ/IVA. 
•  Clinical severity (CFTR2 patients registry)  average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L and 
prevalence of pancreatic insufficiently (PI) > 50%.  
With regard to (1), the pre-specified list contains mutations that are very likely to have no CFTR 
translated protein. The position of the Applicant that VX-445/TEZ/IVA only requires one F508del allele 
is based on the fact that the (included) MF mutations in study 102 have no protein and therefore the 
effect seen has to be caused by the F508del allele. Although plausible and likely, it is theoretically still 
possible that some of the MF mutants may have a minor contribution to the CFTR-mediated chloride 
transport upon treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA.  
With regard to (2), the 10% cut-off seems acceptable as it has been used and justified in previous 
procedures. The criterion (2) mutations were tested for non-responsiveness to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In 
FRT cells, 8 mutations (3199del16, A559T, I507del, L467P, N1303K, R1066C, R560T, V520F) did not 
respond to VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment, while 4 mutations (G85E, M1101K, L1077P and R347P) did 
show responsiveness. However, the inclusion and responsiveness data are based on the assumption 
that in vitro data do correlate with in vivo data, while an IVIVC has not been established.   
Therefore, the results from mainly the patients included based on criterion (1), which is 78% of the 
patients, is considered of value (provided as an ad-hoc analysis). The efficacy in this subset and in 
genotype subgroups could be used to draw conclusions on the acceptability of the “new paradigm” i.e. 
only one single F508del allele is required. The totality of evidence generated in the pivotal clinical 
studies could be considered to draw a conclusion on whether the F508del allele is the main target of 
action (see further discussion below). 
In terms of F/F patients entering Study 103 some patients may have already been on therapy at the 
time of screening, and indeed could continue therapy right up to the start of the TEZ/IVA run in, while 
others may have been naïve to Vertex CFTR modulators (of note, those on non-Vertex CFTR 
modulators had a wash out prior to screening). Stratification according to ppFEV1 was applied on the 
ppFEV1 measurements taken after at least 13 days of TEZ/IVA run-in, rather than the screening 
ppFEV1 values. A subgroup analysis for Vertex CFTR modulator naïve versus treatment-experienced 
patients indicates that the magnitude of the observed treatment effect (LS mean 7.8%, 95% CI 
(4.8,10.8)) for CFTR modulator experienced patients is less than that for CFTR modulator naïve 
patients (LS mean 13.2%, 95% CI (8.5,17.9)). Overall various subgroup analyses requested do not 
suggest a major differential treatment effect for CFTR-modulator naïve and CFTR-modulator 
experienced patients. However, subjects who were CFTR modulator naïve had a lower mean baseline 
ppFEV1 value (58.5 for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 57.2 for the TEZ/IVA group) than subjects who 
were CFTR modulator experienced (63.8 for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 61.8 for the TEZ/IVA 
group). Although the small sample size in these subgroups is acknowledged, comparison of the week 4 
and week 8 ppFEV1 values across these four subgroups suggests that the screening period of 4 weeks 
may not have been sufficient for CFTR-modulator naïve patients randomized to TEZ/IVA to derive the 
full benefit of this treatment by time of baseline ppFEV1 assessment. Consequently, it is considered 
that the magnitude of the treatment effect of VX-445/TEZ/IVA vs TEZ/IVA in the overall study 103 
population may be overestimated and that the treatment effect estimate obtained in the CFTR-
modulator experienced patients is relevant to prescribers (LS mean 7.8%, 95% CI (4.8,10.8)).  
This information is considered relevant for the prescribers and is mentioned in Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC.

Study 105 is an extension study and enrolled subjects who participated in study 102 and 103.  
Endpoints 
The parameters ppFEV1 and SwCl endpoints were used in the dose response study 001. These 
parameters are acceptable endpoints to define the Dose-Response relationship. 
For the pivotal studies 102 and 103, the primary endpoint was an absolute change in LS mean ppFEV1 
(through week 24 and at week 4, for study 102 and 103 respectively). FEV1 is the advocated primary 
endpoint in EMA’s guideline on CF (CHMP/EWP/9147/08). The key secondary efficacy endpoints in 
study 102 (number of pulmonary exacerbations, absolute change in SwCl, absolute change in CFQ-R RD 
Score and absolute change in BMI) and study 103 (absolute change in SwCl and absolute change in 
CFQ-R RD Score) are all accepted endpoints in clinical studies on CF.  
In extension Study 105, the same endpoints were used. 
Efficacy on other organs could have been explored by analysing faecal elastase-1, plasma IRT, bile 
acids C4 and FGF. However, such data were not collected as the included subjects are likely to have 
progressive damage to their exocrine pancreas that is irreversible.  
Statistical Analyses 
For study 102, the primary analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) with change from baseline at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 as the 
dependent variable. The model included treatment group, visit, and treatment by visit interaction as 
fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) and 
sex (male versus female) as covariates. Type I error was controlled through a hierarchical testing-
procedure.  
For study 103, a MMRM was also used, but with Day 15 and Week 4 as the dependent variable and 
with continuous baseline ppFEV1 and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates. 
The use of a MMRM for the evaluation of the primary endpoint in both studies is acceptable. The 
analyses used to examine the secondary endpoints are also acceptable.  
In extension study 105, a MMRM was also used to estimate the change from baseline in ppFEV1 at 
each time point.  
A limited part of study team was unblinded following the evaluation of results from an interim analysis 
by the IDMC. This was only done when the efficacy boundary was crossed and the Vertex team 
members who were unblinded were not involved in the conduct of the remaining part of the study. It is 
considered that the unblinding of (senior) members of the Vertex team could still be a risk to the 
integrity of the study, although the approach of the applicant seems acceptable and the study was not 
subject to several changes after the first interim analysis (IA), this issue will remain an uncertainty. 
In both studies (102 and 103), a sensitivity analysis was performed for the evaluation of the primary 
endpoints. This sensitivity analysis was based on the classification of patients with missing data into a 
number of missing categories and may not have been sufficiently sensitive to assess departures from 
the missing at random assumption. However, the rate of missing data is low.  
Efficacy and additional analyses 
Dose regimen and posology 
Adults 
For CF patients 18 years and older with an F/MF mutation, three doses (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) 
of VX-445 were tested in combination with the approved dosage of TEZ/IVA. A difference in ppFEV1 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 116/117 
 
 
 
 
compared to placebo was seen for all doses tested strengths (11.1, 7.8 and 13.8, for 50, 100 and 200 
mg respectively). An improvement (decline) compared to placebo was also detected for SwCl (-36.1, -
31.0, -36.9 mmol/Lfor 50, 100 and 200 mg, respectively). However, no clear dose response has been 
seen, as the 100 mg arm shows a response lower than the 50 mg and 200 mg (possibly due to pooling 
of D1 and D2 data which occurred in the 100 mg only).  
The difference on the most sensitive and less variable parameter SwCl, between the 50 mg and 
200 mg was only 0.8 mmol/L. For the ppFEV1 a difference of 2.7% was observed between the 50 mg 
and the 200 mg. This result could be considered as a relevant difference, but such a conclusion is 
hampered because the sample size (especially in the 50 mg arm) is small and the parameter therefore 
more variable. These results could suggest a rather flat dose-response curve. The response seen with 
lower doses of VX-445, could be of importance for patients with hepatic impairment as discussed in the 
clinical pharmacology section. 
For CF patients 18 years and older with an F/F mutation only the 200 mg dose was investigated. A 
benefit with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA was seen, but from this population no dose-
response information can be extracted. For ivacaftor and tezacaftor the approved dosing strengths 
were used (TEZ 100 mg qd, and IVA 150mg q12h). This is considered acceptable, as the VX-445 does 
not affect the TEZ or IVA PK and because steady-state exposures of TEZ and IVA are similar in the 
absence or presence of VX-445 in CF subjects. 
When considering the efficacy data, the exposure-response models and the simulated efficacy data for 
ppFEV1 and SwCL, the 200-mg provides the best effect in all analyses.  
Therefore, the intended dosing regimen in Adults (VX-445 200 mg qd, TEZ 100 mg qd and IVA 150 mg 
q12h), is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Adolescents 
There were no Phase 1/2 PK adolescent data to inform the dose choice, nor was there 
modelling/simulation of Phase 1/2 data in advance of Phase 3. VX-445 PK in 12 to <18 years-old was 
predicted to be similar to the PK parameters in adults; hence, the same adult dose was used in 
adolescents in the pivotal studies.   
The Applicant justified that the recommended dose of IVA and TEZ/IVA is the same for adults and 
adolescents, and like TEZ and IVA, VX-445 is a CYP3A substrate and hence the impact of CYP ontogeny 
is expected to be similar for all 3 drugs. CYP enzyme maturity is also similar between adults and 
adolescents. In addition, based on historical data on weight and age in CF subjects, body weights in 
the adolescent population are only slightly lower than those of adults with CF. Consequently, Pop-PK 
analysis of PK data from Phase 1/2 and 3 confirmed that age and weight were not significant co-
variates, and clearance in adults and adolescents was similar. However, while the lowest weight 
included in the Pop-PK analysis was 29kg, there are a limited data in CF subjects weighting <40 kg in 
the Phase 3 studies. Further data on PK in low weight patients is expected in due course from the 
ongoing open label PK/safety study (VX18-445-106) in children aged 6-11 years (both F/F and F/MF 
genotypes), where half the adult dose is being tested in patients under 30 kg. 
Pivotal studies 
•  CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF genotype (study 102) 
In pivotal study 102, the demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two 
treatment groups. In terms of the F/MF genotypes represented in the clinical study, across the 403 
F/MF subjects in the FAS, 79 different MF mutations have been represented. 314/403 patients had 
Class I (i.e. no CFTR) mutation; in total 67 Class I mutations were recruited. In terms of mutations 
that are not Class I, (i.e. qualified under Criterion 2), 12 MF mutation types were recruited (missense 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 117/118 
 
 
 
or in frame deletion mutations) in 89 patients. Due to the genetic variability of CF as a disease, it is 
acknowledged by CHMP that not all genotypes will be able to be tested. 
The inclusion of patients with ppFEV1 <40 (34/403) did not comply with the inclusion criteria. The 
inclusion criterion pertaining to screening ppFEV1 was met in all enrolled subjects in Study 102, but 
the ppFEV1 decreased at their baseline study visit. 
Three concomitant antibiotic treatments were used more often in the placebo group (Tobramycin: 
55.7% vs 39%; Ciprofloxacin: 36% vs 16%; Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim: 26.1% vs 17.0%). 
This difference can be attributed to the imbalance in the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) 
(numerically higher in the placebo group). These antibiotic usage differences are a consequence of the 
effectiveness of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA regimen. 
Missing data for the repeated measurements data was not an issue (less than 10%).  
Primary endpoint: 
For the primary endpoint, the LS mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 through 
week 24 between the VX-445TEZ/IVA and placebo groups was 14.3% (95% CI 12.7 – 15.8; 
p<0.0001) in favour of the triple combination. The obtained difference was above the predefined 
threshold (5.0%) and considered highly clinically relevant (Please refer to the report of the workshop 
on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/769571/2012)). Approximately 80% patients treated 
with the TC have a benefit of ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 15% in the placebo group. The result of the 
sensitivity analysis, a MMRM based on multiple imputations (MIs), was consistent with the primary 
analysis.  
Secondary endpoints: 
The key secondary endpoint, absolute change in ppFEV1 in 4 weeks, was in line with the results of the 
primary endpoint at 24 weeks (13.7 %; P<0.0001; 95% CI: 12.0, 15.3). This suggests a stable 
improvement from 4 weeks on.  
For the key secondary endpoints pulmonary exacerbations, the rate ratio was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25 – 
0.55, p<0.0001) in favour of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. This corresponds to a reduction of 63% of pulmonary 
exacerbations, which is considered clinically relevant. The reductions in pulmonary exacerbations 
requiring hospitalization and/or IV antibiotic treatment were also statistically and clinically significant. 
The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation was also in favour of the triple combination 
(HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; p<0.0001). 
For the key secondary endpoint, changes in SwCl from baseline, the stable reduction of -41.8 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -44.4 to -39.3; p< 0.0001) through week 24 compared to placebo is considered clinically 
relevant (MCID:-10 mmol/L). Approximately 95% of the patients treated with the TC had clinically 
relevant benefit, compared to only 5% in the placebo group.   
Also, a key secondary endpoint, change in CRQ-R RD score, improved significantly in the TC arm 
compared to the placebo arm (20.2 points; 95% CI 17.5,23.0; p<0.0001). With an MCID of 4 points, 
this increase in considered clinically relevant. All other CFQ-R domains indicated an improvement with 
the TC compared to placebo. 
The key secondary endpoint, absolute change in BMI, presented also a benefit of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
arm over placebo. A change of 1.04 kg/m2(95% CI: 0.85, 1.23; p<0.0001) compared to placebo was 
observed; considered to be clinically relevant.  
At baseline, median BMI baseline was 20.80 kg/m2 (min, max: 14.42, 33.80) in the placebo group and 
21.36 (15.01, 30.86) in the TC group. In total, study 102 recruited 50 overweight patients, and 17 
undernourished patients. Therefore, there were an unknown number of underweight subjects as well 
as of overweight/obese patients. An analysis of BMI was provided for undernourished and overweight 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 118/119 
 
 
 
subjects according to the WHO thresholds. Both overweight and underweight patients treated with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA showed gains in BMI consistent with the overall population. 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline 
use of common CF medications.  
Additional analysis 
An ad-hoc subgroup analysis was performed on patients included based on genetic criterion 1 (likely to 
have no CFTR protein translated) and on criterion 2 (missense not responding the TEZ and/or IVA in 
vitro). Class 1 (MF) mutant patients show an absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 14.8% 
comparing the triple combination with placebo. The missense mutant patients showed a difference in 
ppFEV1 of 12.9%. Furthermore, for the criterion 1 mutations, a subdivision was made for Nonsense 
mutations, Canonical splice mutations and insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift. For missense 
and in-frame deletions (criterion 2) a subdivision was made for mutations that were responsive or not 
to the triple therapy. The outcomes of these analyses were similar to the overall study outcome.  
Within the IA2 from study 105, the efficacy data were presented for patients from parent study 102. 
These data showed that the positive treatment effect continues to be maintained with continued 
treatment. In general, the data indicate that for MF patients from the “placebo” group, treatment with 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA results in a similar benefit for all efficacy parameters when compared to the group 
that received already the triple combination in study 102. When comparing the data from week 24 and 
week 48 for the patients that received already the triple combination in study 102, all the efficacy 
parameters still seemed to slightly improve. Subgroup analyses for FEV1 and SwCL for the different MF 
genotypes were also performed for the “placebo” group of study 102. The outcomes of these analyses 
were similar to the overall study outcome.    
•  CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype (study 103/105) 
In the pivotal study 103, the demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two 
treatment groups. Missing data for the repeated measurements data was not an issue (less than 
10%).  
Primary endpoint: 
For the primary endpoint, the LS mean treatment difference in absolute change in ppFEV1 at week 4 
between the VX-445TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups was 10.0% (95% CI 7.4 – 12.6; p<0.0001) in 
favour of the triple combination. The obtained difference was above the predefined threshold (5.0%) 
and considered clinically relevant. Approximately 70% patients treated with the TC have a benefit of 
ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 13% in the TEZ/IVA group.  
Secondary endpoint: 
For the key secondary endpoint, change in SwCl from baseline, a positive effect is observed after 
treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA. A stable reduction of -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -
50.1 to -40.1; p< 0.0001) at week 4 is considered clinically relevant. Approximately 95% of the 
patients had a clinically relevant reduction in SwCl, when treated with the triple combination. 
Also, key secondary endpoint, change in CRQ-R RD score, improved significantly in the TC arm 
compared to the TEZ/IVA arm (17.4 points; 95% CI 11.8,23.0; p<0.0001). Also, all other CFQ-R 
domains indicated an improvement with the TC compared to TEZ/IVA. 
Although no robust conclusion can be drawn, ad-hoc analyses on BMI and weight also seem to 
demonstrate the beneficial effect of the TC over TEZ/IVA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 119/120 
 
 
 
Consistent benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline use of 
common CF medications. 
• 
Extension study 105 
Because of the short 4-week duration of study 103, results from the extension study 105 were also 
analysed to identify whether the effects seen at 4 weeks, remained stable up to 24 weeks of 
treatment. All patients rolled over to study 105, in which the patients from the TEZ/IVA group also 
received the triple combination. 
The results for the change in ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-R RD showed a maintenance of response when 
treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Subjects treated with the TC in the parent study continued to have a 
similar benefit at 4 weeks and through 24 weeks of treatment, respectively (ppFEV1: 10.4 vs 10.9 
percentage points; SwCL: -43.4 vs -47.2 mmol/l; CFQ-R RD: 14.3 vs 16 points).   
With a longer follow-up, data for pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and the nutritional status also 
became available. 
For the number of PEx, an estimated event rate per year of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.18-0.48) and a 
probability of event-free survival of 0.859 (95% CI: 0.777-0.912) was anticipated. For this endpoint, 
no control-group, or event rate at baseline was present, therefore, the benefit over TEZ/IVA is difficult 
to determine. When comparing the observed PEx data for study 103/105 to the data from the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group in study 102 (event rate per year 0.37 (0.25, 0.55); the probability of event-free 
survival 0.842 (0.783, 0.886) is considered similar. Therefore, the presented exacerbation results for 
F/F patients from study 105, appear supportive of the benefit observed with the TC.  
With regard to the nutritional status, a benefit compared to baseline was observed for all parameters 
(change in BMI, BMI z-score and body weight). 
Overall, the efficacy results from the F/F patients in study 105, confirmed that in this patient 
population a long-term benefit was observed after treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. These results 
overcome the uncertainties that went along with the 4-week study duration of study 103. However, to 
ensure that these positive treatment effects continue to be maintained updated data of study 105 
should be provided in the post authorization setting. Within these analyses, the applicant is also 
requested to perform subgroup analysis for weight, BMI, and their respective z-scores confined for 
adolescents. 
Cross study comparison/Responder analysis 
In addition, a responder analysis was performed for the 7 pivotal Phase 3 studies of VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
(Studies 102 and 103), TEZ/IVA (Studies 661-106 and 661-108), or IVA (Studies 770-102, 770-110, 
and 770-111). The comparison between the placebo controlled studies in patients with at least one 
F508del allele (study 661-108 (F/RF), study 661-106 (F/F) and study 102 (F/MF) could suggest that at 
least an additional 20% of patients will have a clinically relevant response to VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
compared to TEZ/IVA. However, this would be a useful comparison if the F/any paradigm would be 
well demonstrated (which currently is not), and therefore by extension that it could be accepted that 
all genotypes with one F can be assumed to respond sufficiently. 
Moreover, the comparisons are based on cross-study comparisons with different populations, which 
introduces uncertainties and these comparisons cannot be considered as additional evidence for the 
F/any paradigm or to support extrapolation of findings in the F/MF population to the F/G and F/RF 
populations. The CHMP maintained that the F/any hypothesis has not been conclusively demonstrated. 
As such, the F/G and F/RF require their own demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety. It is 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 120/121 
 
 
 
considered that these comparisons while interesting, do not obviate the need for robust, comparative, 
clinical data in F/G and F/RF patients from clinical trials. 
Real world clinical data 
Upon request by CHMP, the Applicant provided real world data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Patient Registry (CFFPR) for F/RF and F/G and also F/F and F/MF patients treated with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA.  
F/RF and F/G patients who started with VX-445/TEZ/IVA therapy between 21 October 2019 and 31 
December 2019 (n=521), who had a lung function measurement at baseline and follow-up (n=297, 
57%) were included in the analyses. Only ppFEV1 values were provided, as other efficacy parameters 
are not routinely measured. The registry data from the F/MF and F/F patient population showed results 
in line with the effects observed in studies 102 and 103. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. CFFPR data presented are in itself limited and not sufficiently detailed, and as 
such raised several questions such as the exact modulator therapy used, the duration of use which is 
not known, as well as included specific genotypes and individual patient efficacy data which are not 
presented. Unavailability of such information is inherent to registry data but does introduce 
uncertainties. It can also be questioned whether the patients in the analysis set can be considered 
sufficiently representative of the overall F/G and F/RF populations to draw conclusions on these 
populations.  
Based on the available data, improvements in ppFEV1 were seen in the 136 F/G and 161 F/RF 
populations of 4.3% and 2.7% respectively. These improvements are observed on top of approved 
therapies as at least 90% of the patients were exposed to at least one other CFTR modulator. 
However, it appeared that patients only needed record of exposure to CFTR modulators in 2019; hence 
it is possible that some patients may not have been current users of CFTR modulators at the time of 
starting triple therapy, and as such the ‘experienced’ figures presented may be an overestimation.  
Bearing in mind the limitations and questions arising from the registry data, the magnitude of the 
additional response from treatment with VX445/TEZ/IVA over prior CFTR therapies is limited. It is 
unexpected that the F/G group had greater efficacy compared to the F/RF population. Indeed, in view 
of the limited efficacy observed in clinical trials for F/RFs patients treated with TEZ/IVA compared  
patients with G/any mutations treated with IVA, it would be considered that F/RF group should have 
had more potential for improvement with VX445/TEZ/IVA by treating the F allele.   
It is however agreed that effect size estimates in these real-world analyses are not directly comparable 
to results from a clinical study in which data are collected in a controlled setting. For example, the 
ppFEV1 data from the pivotal clinical studies were captured and analysed after a 4-week treatment 
duration (Studies 102 and 103) and a 24-week treatment duration (Study 102). In contrast, ppFEV1 
measurements used in this analysis of CFFPR data were captured at different time points following 
initiation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment reflecting the real-world nature of data collection in routine 
clinical practice (from <28 days to over 90 days, with the mean exposure duration of 65.6 days for 
F/MF patients and 65.4 days for F/F patients, as noted above). Additionally, spirometry data collected 
in the CFFPR has greater variability because the assessment is performed at a local site using local 
equipment compared to the standardized equipment and protocols used in a clinical study.  
An Oral Explanation was held in June 2020 CHMP meeting, in order to discuss the F/any hypothesis 
and efficacy data supporting the broad indication applied for F/any population.  
The CHMP welcomed the registry data but considered these data inherently limited and hence subject 
to bias. Furthermore, the data are not complete enough to reliably demonstrate the efficacy and safety 
of VX445/TEZ/IVA in F/G and F/RF patients. In conclusion the CHMP was of the view that the registry 
Assessment report

Page 121/122 
 
 
 
data do not obviate the need for robust, comparative, clinical efficacy and safety data in F/G and F/RF 
patients from randomized controlled clinical studies.In conclusion, the cross-study comparison 
responder analysis and the registry data on its own without the ongoing clinical trial (study 104) data 
in F/G and F/RF mutations do not sufficiently support the added benefit over approved modulator 
therapies. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the efficacy has been demonstrated only in patients 
with F/F and F/MF mutations where randomized clinical trial data are available.  
Study 104 
The data of study 104 in F/G and F/RF patients should contribute to the understanding of the efficacy 
in the F/RF and F/G patient populations. The Applicant was therefore encouraged to submit results of 
the clinical study 104 as soon as possible in a variation procedure for further assessment to which, 
they agreed. 
There is a positive B/R identified both for F/MF patients with unmet medical need due to absence of 
treatment available and for (F/F) patients. Therefore, the CHMP did not agree with the request of the 
Applicant to wait for the data of study 104 as any further delay in CHMP opinion is considered not 
feasible/acceptable. 
Proposed indication 
Indication 
The Applicant requested the following indication: “Kaftrio (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) is indicated in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 
aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.” 
Within the current submission, the applicant only provided clinical trial data for the F/MF and F/F 
patient populations. Clinically relevant improvements were reached in both patient populations with 
the VX-445/TEZ/IVA triple combination. Considering the absence of a VX-445 monotherapy and VX-
445/IVA therapy as control arms, the demonstration of efficacy of each of the components of the triple 
combination cannot be established in a clinical setting. Although uncertainties remain on the 
contribution of all components, as not all combination were tested in a clinical setting in line with the 
FDC guideline, the in vitro data, the highly relevant clinical benefit and the well-tolerated safety profile 
of this product were considered relevant enough to outweigh this particular uncertainty in the F/MF 
and F/F populations. 
The Applicant introduced a new “paradigm”. They consider that if a CFTR modulator has a large effect 
on the F508del-CFTR, then the presence of only a single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a 
clinical benefit. The Applicant considers that “CF patients with an F508del allele (F) and a minimal 
function allele (MF) that does not produce protein provide the key test for this hypothesis because any 
benefit can only be derived from the F508del allele.” 
Assessment of qualification under “criterion 2”, required a robust validated in vitro in vivo correlation 
per mutation so that we can be confident that patients with that specific mutation will also not 
respond. The applicant assumed that if in the FRT cells no response is seen, also clinically the mutation 
will not be corrected by the triple combination. Whether such a “negative” IVIV correlation exists is not 
known and has not been demonstrated.  
Overall, it is acknowledged that criterion 1 and criterion 2 patients both showed a relevant effect on 
ppFEV1 in subgroup analysis. Furthermore, significant and consistent improvements were seen in each 
mutation subcategory within MF Class I (splice, nonsense, and indel-frameshift). In subgroup analysis 
of clinical results (and even though numbers are small), in criterion 2 F/MF patients showed clinically 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 122/123 
 
 
 
relevant improvement in ppFEV1 and sweat chloride, regardless of whether the MF mutation responded 
or didn’t respond to VX-445/TEZ/IVA in FRT testing.  
Theoretically, it is still possible that some of the MF mutants may make a minor contribution to the 
CFTR-mediated chloride transport upon treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The totality of evidence 
consists of:  
-  Majority of the mutations in study 102 are Class I mutations and show improved ppFEV1 and SwCl. 
o  87% of the class I mutants has a PTC before the NBD2 domain and are likely not to form a 
functional protein. In this subgroup the ppFEV1 improvement is 13.2% (10.4, 16.0) which is 
consistent with the overall study population. 
o  G542X (n=65 in study 102) and R553X (used in HBE cells) do not form a protein. These alleles 
form half of the nonsense mutations subgroup which shows similar clinical benefit as the FAS. In 
a subgroup analysis for G542X specifically an ppFEV1 improvement of 13.6% (9.4, 17.7) is seen. 
-  CF patients with the F/MF criterion 2 show substantial clinical benefit, derived by the F508del allele. 
o  Clinical results of non-responsive and responsive criterion 2 mutations suggest that effect is 
mediated by the F508del allele. 
-  Result in different studies, with specific collection of MF mutants, show consistent efficacy results.  
o  Results seen in the different studies in which F/MF CF patients were participating show highly 
consistent efficacy results (within group). 
o  The subgroups in genotypes and FRT responsiveness show highly similar results. 
o  Result is consistent with effect seen in the F/F population. 
Overall, based on the pre-clinical data, clinical data and the lack of evidence that all criterion 1 MF 
mutations do not form a protein, it is not accepted by CHMP that all MF Class I mutations are equal 
and that no protein is produced in each and every case. Therefore, the F508del-only treatment 
paradigm has not been adequately substantiated.  
Considering the vast number of Class I mutations and the impracticality of providing empirical 
evidence for each case due to the nature of obtaining sufficient independent HBE cell lines from 
transplant donors, no further preclinical data is requested in this regard for the F/MF and F/F 
populations to explore the Applicant hypothesis.  
The consistent results in the F/MF population subgroups, together with the magnitude of the efficacy 
observed indicate that extrapolation to untested MF mutations can however be accepted. Additionally, 
it is considered important for the prescriber to mention the list of mutations studied in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC and that not all mutations have been clinically tested in studies 102 and 103. 
 In addition, the Applicant agreed to expand the efficacy information of VX-445/TEZ/IVA (overall and 
per genotype subgroup) by providing registry data from a PASS. 
Extrapolation to the F/RF and F/G CF patients.  
The proposed indication includes all patients with at least one F508del allele (independent of the 
second allele), which is based on the above-mentioned F508del only paradigm. Therefore, also patients 
for whom already an approved modulator regimen exists will be included in the indication (F/RF and 
F/G). As indicated above, the Applicant hypothesis is not considered sufficiently demonstrate to allow 
for extrapolation in F/RF and robust, comparative clinical trial data are required. Furthermore, the 
additional benefit of Kaftrio over existing licensed treatments for F/G and F/RF patients has not been 
quantified in these populations.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Clinically relevant improvement is achieved in both the F/MF and F/F patient populations with the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA triple combination compared to placebo or TEZ/IVA, respectively. Due to the absence 
of a VX-445 monotherapy and VX-445/IVA therapy as control arms, the requirement of demonstration 
of efficacy for all three compounds as required in the FDC guideline cannot be established based on 
clinical data. However, the in vitro data, the highly relevant clinical benefit and the well-tolerated 
safety profile could be considered relevant enough to outweigh this uncertainty in the F/MF and F/F 
patient populations. 
It is theoretically still possible that some of the MF mutants may make a minor contribution and the 
F508del-only treatment paradigm has not been definitively substantiated. Nevertheless, the consistent 
results in the F/MF population subgroups indicate that extrapolation to untested MF mutations can be 
accepted.  
Clinical data on the F/RF and F/G are limited to registry data with its inherent limitation and bias and is 
therefore not considered to reliably demonstrate the efficacy and safety of VX445/TEZ/IVA in F/G and 
F/RF patients. 
Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that the added benefit of Kaftrio in the F/RF and F/G population 
over approved therapies has not been sufficiently justified. Any further delay in CHMP opinion (and 
awaiting the results of study 104) is not agreed in the context of patients for which there is a positive 
B/R identified (F/F and F/FM) and absence of treatment available (F/MF). The data of study 104 are 
necessary to be able to conclude on a B/R for this patient population and to support the broad 
F508del/any indication. Whether these future data are sufficient will be a matter of assessment. The 
applicant agreed to submit those data in the post-marketing setting (type II variation).  
In conclusion, positive clinical efficacy is only considered demonstrated in the F/MF and F/F 
populations. The final indication granted by CHMP is as follows:  
“Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the 
CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation.” 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety database included 10 clinical studies with VX-445 as a monotherapy or as part of a 
TC regimen, including 5 completed Phase 1 studies (Study 002 (OC DDI), 003 (ADME), 005 (FDC BA), 
006(DDI) and 009 (QT/QTc), 1 completed Phase 1/2 study (Study 001), 2 completed Phase 3 studies 
(102 and 103), and 2 ongoing Phase 3 studies (study 105 - long term safety and study and 106 -
safety and PK). 
Core Safety Analyses 
The core safety analyses in CF subjects evaluated data from Study 102, Study 103, and an interim 
analysis (IA) of the open-label extension Study 105. A second interim analysis (IA2) was submitted 
with the response to the first CHMP LoQ.  
Safety data from Studies 102 and 103 were not pooled in the core safety analysis because of the 
substantial differences in the designs of the 2 studies. These differences involve especially treatment 
duration, use of different comparator groups i.e. a placebo group in Study 102 and an active 
comparator in study 103.  Because of these differences, pooling the data could confound the 
comparison between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo in Study 102.

The Study 102 Safety Set contains all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The Study 103 Safety Set for the Treatment Period (hereafter the Study 103 Safety Set) 
includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Study 103 Treatment 
Period (i.e., does not include subjects who were only dosed in the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period). 
The Study 105 Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in 
Study 105. 
The Cumulative Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA during the parent Studies 102 or 103 and/or during Study 105. 
−  Selected safety analyses were performed for the subset of subjects in the Cumulative 
Safety Set who received ≥48 weeks of treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 
In addition, supportive safety analyses were submitted for various doses of VX-445 and multiple 
treatment regimens (different TC regimens) in study 001 and ongoing Study 106 in CF subjects 6 
through 11 years of age.  
All data are from the second interim analysis (IA2), unless otherwise indicated.  
Patient exposure 
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups in both 
Study 102 (VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo groups) and Study 103 (VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA 
groups). The demography and baseline characteristics of these Phase 3 study populations were also 
representative of the CF population for the proposed indication. 
Exposure data 
The mean exposure duration to VX-445/TEZ/IVA was 23.6 weeks in Study 102, 4.0 weeks in Study 
103 and 21.5 weeks in Study 105.  
Over 700 unique subjects received at least 1 dose of VX-445 as monotherapy or as part of a TC 
regimen.  
At the time of IA1 (study 105), in the Cumulative Safety Set (parent Studies 102 or 103 and/or during 
Study 105), 146 subjects had an exposure of ≤ 24 weeks, 307 subject > 24 ≤ 48 weeks, 58 subjects 
≥ 48 weeks and 56 subjects > 48 weeks. 
The Study 105 IA2 Safety Set included 506 subjects, who had a mean exposure duration of 37.2 
weeks, representing 392.2 patient-years of exposure. The Cumulative Safety Set included 510 subjects 
who had a mean exposure duration of 46.7 weeks, representing 496.6 patient-years of exposure. A 
subset of 271 subjects received ≥48 weeks of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment and had a mean exposure of 
57.2 weeks. 
The safety profile of VX-445 in combination with TEZ/IVA was derived primarily from Study 102, a 24-
week, placebo-controlled study in CF subjects, with the largest exposed population and the longest 
treatment duration. In addition, safety data from two interim analyses (IA1 and IA2) of the ongoing 
OLE Study 105 (as of the data cut-off date of 10 July 2019 and 31 October 2019, respectively) are also 
summarized.

Notes: Total exposure was defined as the sum total of the VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure across all subjects in the applicable IA2 
Safety Set (Study 105 or Cumulative). Duration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (weeks) = ([last dose date – first dose date] in the 
applicable Treatment-emergent Period + 1)/7, regardless of any interruptions in dosing. For subjects who were still on VX-
445/TEZ/IVA at the IA2 data cutoff date, this date was used as the last dose date to calculate the duration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
exposure. Duration of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (years) = duration of VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (weeks)/48; 1 year = 48 weeks. 
Adverse events 
The overview of AEs in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 Safety Set (OLE) is presented in Table 
37. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 93.1% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 96.0% in the 
placebo group. Twenty-eight (13.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 42 (20.9%) subjects 
in the placebo group had serious AEs (SAEs). The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or 
moderate in severity. Nineteen (9.4%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 10 (5.0%) subjects 
in the placebo group interrupted study drug due to AEs.  
Two (1.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and no subjects in the placebo group discontinued 
study drug due to AEs. There were no deaths, and no subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had life-
threatening AEs. 
Study 103 Safety Set 
The incidence of subjects with at least 1 AE was 58.2% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the 
TEZ/IVA group. Two (3.6%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the 
TEZ/IVA group had SAEs. The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. No 
subjects had AEs that led to study drug interruption or discontinuation. There were no deaths or life-
threatening AEs.

Overall, results from the Cumulative Safety Set were consistent with the safety data presented 
individually for Studies 102 and 103, as well as for Study 105.  
Safety in Subjects Who Received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for At Least 48 Weeks 
In IA1, a total of 57 (98.3%) subjects had at least 1 AE.  
In IA2, a total of 265 (97.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE. The exposure-adjusted event rates for the 
majority of AEs were similar or lower than in the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The majority of 
subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity (63 mild (23.2%), 161 moderate (59.4%), 41 
severe (15.1%)). There were no life-threatening AEs.   
A total of 50 (18.5%) subjects had at least 1 SAE. The exposure-adjusted rates for SAEs were similar 
or lower than in the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group.  
No subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation; 26 (9.6%) subjects had AEs that led to 
treatment interruption. 
Overview of AEs in Healthy Subjects 
In the pooled analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects, 43 (22.5%) subjects in the Any VX-445 
group and 13 (24.1%) subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 AE. In both groups, the majority of 
AEs were mild in severity; there were no SAEs or deaths. One (1.9%) subject in the placebo group had 
a severe AE.  
There were 2 (1.0%) subjects in the Any VX-445 group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the placebo group who 
had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. There were no AEs that led to treatment interruption in 
any group. 
Common AEs 
The AEs with an incidence of ≥5% of Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 Safety Set (OLE) is 
presented in Table 40. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common 
illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. 
AEs occurring in ≥8% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher than in 
the placebo group were headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, alanine 
transaminase (ALT) increased, aspartate transaminase (AST) increased, blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased, nasal congestion, rash, and rhinorrhoea; each occurred in ≤20% of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group.  
Among the AEs with an incidence of ≥5% in any group, AEs occurring in < 8% of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher than in the placebo group were, sinusitis, rhinitis, 
influenza, and blood bilirubin increased.  
Blood bilirubin increased was observed with VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment; this finding is consistent with 
the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter inhibition effect by VX-445.  
The study was conducted through the winter season, and most of the AEs of influenza occurred during 
that time. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, none of the AEs of influenza were considered related to study 
drug and all subjects continued study drug dosing, except 2 subjects who resumed treatment after an 
interruption.

Lastly, there was a lower rate of AEs reported in the infections and infestations SOC overall in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group compared with the placebo group. 
Study 103 Safety Set,  
In the Study 103 Safety Set, Study 105 Safety Set and Cumulative Safety Set, among the AEs with an 
incidence of ≥5% in any group, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF 
disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. Table 40 presents the AEs 
with an incidence of ≥5% in any group. 
Table 40: AEs With an Incidence of At Least 5% in Any Group by PT: Study 103 Safety Set

The exposure-adjusted event rates for the majority of AEs were similar or lower in Study 105 than in 
the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. 
In IA2, 471 (93%) subjects experienced an AE. The AEs were mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. 
The exposure-adjusted event rates for the majority of AEs were similar or lower in Study 105 than in 
the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. Table 41 presents the AEs with an incidence of ≥5%.

The AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in 
CF subjects 12 years of age and older. Overall, results from the Cumulative Safety Set were consistent 
with the safety data from parent Studies 102 and 103, as well as for Study 105. 
Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In the set of subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks, 57 (98.3%) subjects had at 
least 1 AE. In IA2, a total of 265 (97.8%) subjects had at least 1 AE. The AEs were mostly consistent 
with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age 
and older or with the safety profile for VX-445/TEZ/IVA of study 102 and study 105.   
AEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks cumulatively

Study 105 Safety Set 
In Study 105, in IA1 143 (28.3%) subjects had AEs considered related or possibly related to study 
drug. In IA2, 169 (33.4%) subjects had AEs considered related or possibly related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA.  
Related AEs that occurred in ≥5 subjects in Study 105 IA2 are summarized in Table 44. The most 
common related AEs were generally consistent with common manifestations and complications of CF 
disease or with the established safety profile for VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Related AEs of photosensitivity 
reaction occurred in 7 subjects.  
Table 44: Related AEs Occurring in At Least 5 Subjects by PT: OL (Study 105) Safety Set 
Cumulative Safety Set and Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In both the overall cumulative analysis and the 48-week cumulative exposure analysis, the most 
common related AEs were generally consistent with common manifestations and complications of CF 
disease or with the established safety profile for VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In addition, exposure-adjusted 
analyses of event rates in Study 102 compared with Study 105 showed a decrease in the rates of the 
majority of related AEs with longer-term treatment.

Safety Set are presented in Table 46. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
The majority of subjects overall had AEs that were mild (29.8%) or moderate (56.3%) in severity. 
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 19 (9.4%) subjects had severe AEs and no subjects had life-threatening 
AEs. In the placebo group, 14 (7.0%) subjects had severe AEs and 1 (0.5%) subject had a life-
threatening AE of neuroglycopenia. 
Study 105 Safety Set 
In IA1, 31 (6.1%) subjects had severe (Grade 3) AEs and 2 (0.4%) subjects had life-threatening 
(Grade 4) AEs.

In IA2, 51 (10.1%) subjects had severe (Grade 3) AEs and 2 (0.4%) subjects had life-threatening 
(Grade 4) AEs. The exposure-adjusted event rate for Grade 3/4 AEs was lower in Study 105 than in 
the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (19.84 versus 27.95 events/100PY).  
Brief descriptions of the 2 subjects who had life-threatening AEs are provided below.  
•  One subject with a medical history of depression had a life-threatening AE of suicide attempt, 
which was considered by the investigator to be not related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The event 
resolved without change to VX-445/TEZ/IVA dosing. 
•  One subject with a medical history of recurrent haemoptysis had a life-threatening AE of 
pulmonary haemorrhage, which was considered to be possibly related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The 
event resolved with interruption of VX-445/TEZ/IVA, which has since been resumed.

Study 103 Safety Set 
The majority of AEs in both the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA groups were mild (41.1%) or moderate 
(18.7%) in severity. No subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA 
group had a severe AE (musculoskeletal pain). There were no life-threatening AEs. 
Cumulative Safety Set 
Two (0.4%) subjects had life-threatening AEs (as in Study 105).  
Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
The majority of subjects had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity (63 mild (23.2%), 161 
moderate (59.4%).   
A total of 41 (15.1%) subjects had at least 1 AE that was Grade 3 or 4 in severity. Grade 3/4 events 
that occurred in ≥2 subjects were infective PEx of CF (10 subjects), blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased (8 subjects), DIOS (4 subjects), AST increased (4 subjects), ALT increased (3 subjects), GGT 
increased (2 subjects), gastritis (2 subjects), and influenza (2 subjects).  
There were no life-threatening AEs. 
The majority of events were assessed by the investigator as unrelated (not related or unlikely related) 
to VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment and generally resolved without changes to study drug dosing.  
The overall exposure-adjusted rate for Grade 3/4 AEs was similar between the population who received 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks as of Study 105 IA2 and the placebo group in Study 102 (21.07 
and 23.02 events per 100PY, respectively.

Deaths  
There were no AEs leading to death during the clinical program.  
Serious adverse events  
The SAEs of at least 2 subjects in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 IA2 Safety Set (OLE) are 
presented in Table 47. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Twenty-eight (13.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 42 (20.9%) subjects in the placebo 
group had at least 1 SAE . 
Overall, the SAEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common 
illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. 
SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects in any group and were more common in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
than the placebo group included rash and influenza. Rash events are further discussed below. The 3 
SAEs of influenza in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were all assessed by the investigator as not related to 
study drug. 
The majority of SAEs were assessed by the investigator as unlikely related or not related to study 
drug.

Study 105  
In IA1, a total of 55 (10.9%) subjects had SAEs. In IA2, 80 (15.8%) subjects had SAEs. Overall, the 
SAEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in 
CF subjects 12 years of age and older.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for SAEs was lower in Study 105 than in the Study 102 VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group (27.47 versus 36.93 events/100PY). 
SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects are summarized in Table 47. 
Table 47:Serious AEs Occurring in At Least 2 Subjects by PT: Study 105 Safety Set 
Study 103 Safety Set 
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.6%) subjects had SAEs: 1 subject had an SAE of infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF and 1 subject had an SAE of rash. In the TEZ/IVA group, 1 (1.9%) 
subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF. 
Cumulative Safety Set 
SAEs were reported in 72 (14.1%) subjects. SAEs that occurred in > 2 subjects were infective PEx of 
CF, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, haemoptysis, influenza, and rash. In IA2, additionally 
vascular device infection, ALT increased, and AST increased occurred. All other SAEs occurred in a 
single subject each. 
Safety in subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In IA2, 50 (18.5%) subjects had at least 1 SAE. SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects were infective PEx 
of CF, influenza, DIOS, haemoptysis, rash, and vascular device infection; 
Related serious adverse events  
Study 102 Safety Set, Study 105 IA2 Safety Set, Cumulative Safety Set  
Cumulatively across the parent Studies 102 and 103 and Study 105 IA2, 20 (3.9%) subjects who 
received any VX-445/TEZ/IVA had related SAEs: 6 subjects with related SAEs in Study 102, and 1 
subject with a related SAE in Study 103 and 13 subjects with related SAEs in Study 105.

Related SAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects in the Cumulative TC Safety Period were haemoptysis, rash, 
distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), infective PEx of CF, alanine transaminase (ALT) 
increased, and aspartate transaminase (AST) increased; all other related SAEs occurred in 1 subject 
each. 
Overall, the incidence of related SAEs was low across studies. The majority of these events were 
consistent with common manifestations and complications of CF disease or with the established safety 
profile for VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Many of these events had plausible alternative aetiologies and/or 
confounding factors (e.g., pre-existing medical history, concurrent infections or illnesses), and most of 
the subjects were able to maintain or successfully resume study drug dosing.  
The findings of Study 102 Safety Set, Study 105 IA2 Safety Set, Cumulative Safety Set are presented

No results of related serious events were provided for subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at 
least 48 weeks.  
Study 103 Safety Set 
The SAE of rash in VX-445/TEZ/IVA was assessed by the investigator as related. 
Events of specific interest 
Prespecified events of special interest are transaminase elevation events and rash events. In addition, 
data relevant to the assessment of blood bilirubin and creatine kinase are also discussed. 
Transaminase Elevations 
Liver function test (LFT) elevations have been seen in CF patients, including some receiving IVA 
monotherapy, TEZ/IVA, and VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of liver-related 
data in VX-445 clinical studies was performed. 
The Liver function test (LFT) elevations in Study 102 Safety Set, and Study 105 IA2 Safety Set (OLE) 
are presented in Table 49 and Table 50. The details are provided per safety set.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Twenty-two (10.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 8 (4.0%) subjects in the placebo 
group had at least 1 elevated transaminase event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
severity and were associated with ALT/AST elevations <5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN).  
There were no elevated transaminase events that led to treatment discontinuation. Two (1.0%) 
subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (1.5%) subjects in the placebo group had elevated 
transaminase events that led to treatment interruption: 1 of the subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group 
resumed treatment; the other subject enrolled in the open-label extension study while still on study 
drug interruption and eventually discontinued from the open-label extension study without resuming 
study drug. A narrative is provided in Study 102 CSR/Section 14.3.3. 
No subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 subject (0.5%) in the placebo group had a serious 
elevated transaminase event. 
The median time to onset of first elevated transaminase event was 57.0 days (range: 1, 176) in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 58.0 days (range: 1, 169) in the placebo group. The median duration of 
elevated transaminase events was 17.0 days (range: 4,153) in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 17.0 
days (range: 5, 52) in the placebo group.  
Additional relevant hepatic AEs occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (hepatic 
cirrhosis, hepatocellular injury, and portal hypertension) and 1 (0.5%) subject in the placebo group 
(hepatocellular injury). Events in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
The event of portal hypertension was an SAE in a subject with a medical history of hepatic 
cirrhosis that led to discontinuation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment; it was assessed by the 
investigator as being of moderate severity and possibly related to study drug. 
The event of hepatocellular injury was a non-serious AE that was associated with mildly elevated 
transaminases (<2 × ULN) and was assessed by the investigator as being of mild severity and 
related to study drug. There was no change to study drug dosing. 
The event of hepatic cirrhosis was a non-serious AE that was associated with mildly elevated 
transaminases (<2 × ULN) and was assessed by the investigator as being of mild severity and 
unlikely related to study drug. There was no change to study drug dosing.

• 
The AE of hepatocellular injury in the placebo group was associated with transaminase elevations 
>8 × ULN and resulted in study drug interruption. 
Mean concentrations of transaminase parameters were variable over time in both groups. In the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group, increases from baseline in mean ALT and AST were observed. The mean (SD) 
increases in ALT ranged from 4.8 (20.5) U/L at Week 16 to 8.2 (28.9) U/L at Week 24. The mean (SD) 
increases in AST ranged from 3.2 (13.5) U/L at Week 16 to 6.6 (31.6) U/L at Week 24. In the placebo 
group, there were no trends in ALT or AST.  
An overview of subjects with ALT and/or AST elevations by predefined thresholds and of subjects with 
ALT and/or AST elevations >3 × ULN and total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN is presented in Table 49. 
The ALT/AST and bilirubin elevations did not have to be concurrent and could occur at any time in the 
Treatment-emergent Period, regardless of baseline levels. 
The majority of subjects had ALT and AST values that remained within the normal range. More 
subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had ALT or AST >3×, 5× and 8× ULN, respectively, compared 
to subjects in the placebo group. No subject had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN concurrent with a 
newly occurring elevation in total bilirubin >2 × ULN. Two subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had 
ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN during the study; in 1 subject, the elevations were 
not concurrent (ALT and AST >3 × ULN occurred at the Day 15 Visit; total bilirubin >2 × ULN occurred 
at the Week 24 Visit). The other subject had a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome and an elevated 
total bilirubin at screening >2 × ULN that remained high throughout the study.

a 
Study 103 Safety Set 
Two (3.6%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA group had at 
least 1 elevated transaminase event. All events were mild in severity, and none were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption.

Increases from baseline in mean (SD) ALT and AST were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (9.0 
(16.5) U/L for ALT and 1.6 (13.9) U/L for AST), but not in the TEZ/IVA group (-3.1 (13.1) U/L for ALT 
and -2.0 (8.4) for AST). 
The incidences of maximum transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 ×, >5 ×, or >8 × ULN in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were 7.3%, 3.6%, and 0%, respectively. No subjects in the TEZ/IVA group had 
ALT or AST elevations >3 × ULN or ALT or AST >3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN. 
Study 105 Safety Set 
In IA1, a total of 23 (4.6%) subjects had at least 1 elevated transaminase event, while currently in IA2 
36 (7.1%) subjects had at least 1 elevated transaminase event.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate for elevated transaminase AEs was lower in Study 105 than in the 
Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (16.53 versus 42.92 events/100PY).  
The majority of these events were mild or moderate in severity and were associated with ALT/AST 
elevations <5 × ULN. Elevated transaminase events led to treatment interruption in 11 (2.2%) 
subjects and led to treatment discontinuation in 3 (0.6%) subjects; 2 of the discontinuations were 
SAEs, and no other subjects had serious elevated transaminase events. 
In IA2, the incidences of subjects with maximum on-treatment transaminase elevations (ALT and/or 
AST) above thresholds of >3 ×, >5 ×, and >8 × ULN were 6.3%, 2.2.% and 0.6%, respectively. One 
subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN during the study (not concurrent).  
One additional subject had AST and ALT >3 × ULN concurrent with bilirubin >2 × ULN due to an SAE 
of acute cholecystitis, that were not captured in the clinical database nor included in the Study 105 IA 
tables and listings. This subject recovered quickly following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin parameters returned to the subject’s baseline levels (<2 × ULN).  
Overall, the data related to transaminase elevations in Study 105 were consistent with those in the 
parent studies (refer to Table 50).

Cumulative Safety Set 
Ten (2.0%) subjects discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA due to AEs, with 4 (0.8%) subjects discontinuing 
due to LFT elevations and 2 (0.4%) subjects discontinuing due to rash events.  
Subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
Elevated transaminase AEs occurred in 36 (13.3%) subjects, no events were serious.  
Laboratory elevations in ALT and/or AST >3 ×, 5 ×, and >8 × ULN occurred in 30 (11.1%) subjects, 7 
(2.6%) subjects, and 4 (1.5%) subjects. No subjects had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN 
concurrent with a newly occurring elevation in total bilirubin >2 × ULN. Three (1.1%) subjects had ALT 
or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN during Studies 102 or 105; in 2 subjects, the elevations 
were not concurrent. The third subject had a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome and an elevated 
total bilirubin at screening >2 × ULN that remained high throughout the study. 
Pooled Analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
No subjects had transaminase elevation events. There were no trends in mean ALT or AST in the Phase 
1 studies. In the Any VX-445 group, 1 (0.5%) subject had AST >3 × to ≤5 × ULN at the Safety 
Follow-up Visit. 
Bilirubin Elevation Events 
Blood bilirubin is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and VX-445 is an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
inhibitor based on in vitro results; as such, blood bilirubin levels could be increased with VX-
445/TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
AEs of bilirubin elevation occurred in 10 (5.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.0%) 
subjects in the placebo group. 
None of the AEs of bilirubin elevation were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. One subject in 
the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had an AE of blood bilirubin increased that led to treatment interruption; 
the AE resolved, and study drug was resumed. 
Increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin (up to 4.0 μmol/L) were observed in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group, with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin (up to 2.7 μmol/L) than in direct 
bilirubin (up to 1.3 μmol/L; Study 102 CSR/Table 14.3.4.1); however, the mean values of the 3 
bilirubin parameters were within normal range throughout the study. The bilirubin elevation was 
observed at Day 15 and remained at a similar level for the rest of the study. In the placebo group, 
changes from baseline in mean total bilirubin were minimal. 
The majority of subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range. In the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group, 8 (4.0%) subjects had elevations in total bilirubin >2 × ULN of which one subject 
>2 × ULN. Threshold analyses for direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin showed a similar pattern of 
elevations with that observed in the mean value analyses. In the placebo group, 1 (0.5%) subject had 
elevations in total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
In Study 103 Safety Set, no subjects had AEs of bilirubin elevation. Increases from baseline in mean 
total bilirubin were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin 
than in direct bilirubin; however, the mean values of the 3 bilirubin parameters were within normal 
range throughout the study. The greatest mean (SD) change in total bilirubin (3.0 (2.9) μmol/L) was 
observed at Week 4, compared to placebo -0.6 (2.3) μmol/L.

In Study 105 Safety Set, AEs of bilirubin elevation occurred in 23 (4.5%) subjects. Nineteen (3.8%) 
subjects had elevations in total bilirubin >2 × ULN. Threshold analyses for other bilirubin parameters 
showed a similar pattern of elevations with that observed in the VX445/TEZ/IVA group of Study 102: 
the incidence of >2 × ULN elevations was higher for indirect bilirubin (26 subjects [5.1%]) than direct 
bilirubin (1 subject [0.2%]). Overall, the bilirubin data in Study 105 were consistent with those in the 
parent studies (Studies 102 and 103).  
In the Pooled Analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects, no subjects had AEs of bilirubin 
elevation. Increases in mean total bilirubin were observed in 2 of the Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects, with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than in direct bilirubin.  
Rash Events 
In the Phase 1 DDI study in healthy female subjects taking VX-445/TEZ/IVA and oral hormonal 
contraceptives (Study 002), 4 of 15 subjects (26.7%) had a rash event. Therefore, rash was 
considered an event of special interest in the Phase 3 studies.  
Study 102 Safety Set 
Twenty-two (10.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 13 (6.5%) subjects in the placebo 
group had a least 1 rash event. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity. 
One (0.5%) subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had a rash event that led to treatment 
discontinuation. Four (2.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.5%) subject in the 
placebo group had events that led to treatment interruption; all resumed treatment. 
Serious rash events occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (2 SAEs of rash, 1 
SAE of rash pruritic), of which 2 events were considered treatment related; all events resolved. In the 
placebo group, 1 (0.5%) subject had a serious rash event. 
The median time to onset of first rash event was 13.5 days (range: 5, 157) in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group and 27.0 days (range: 1, 157) in the placebo group. The median duration of rash events was 
7.0 days (range: 1, 92) in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 8.0 days (range: 2, 61) in the placebo 
group. 
The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males in both treatment groups. In the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 16 (16.3%) female subjects and 6 (5.8%) male subjects had rash events. In 
the placebo group, 8 (8.3%) female subjects and 5 (4.8%) male subjects had rash events. 
In female subjects receiving VX-445/TEZ/IVA, 8 (20.5%) subjects who used hormonal therapy during 
the study and 8 (13.6%) subjects not using hormonal therapy had rash events. In female subjects 
receiving placebo, 3 (9.4%) subjects who used hormonal therapy during the study and 
5 (7.8%) subjects not using hormonal therapy had rash events. 
Of the 8 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group who used hormonal therapy and had a rash event, 1 
subject had a rash event before beginning hormonal therapy use; 4 subjects had no changes to study 
drug or hormonal therapy, and the rash resolved; 2 subjects had VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment 
interruptions, discontinued hormonal therapy, and resumed study drug after the rash resolved; and 
1 subject remained on hormonal therapy and discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment, and the rash 
resolved. 
Study 103 Safety Set 
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.6%) subjects had a rash event; both were female. One rash event 
occurred in a subject who had concomitant use of hormonal therapy; this event was considered serious 
and possibly related to study drug. The subject discontinued use of OCs and continued study drug 
treatment, and the rash resolved.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

In the TEZ/IVA group, 2 (3.8%) subjects had a nonserious rash event; both were female, and 
1 subject had concomitant use of hormonal therapy. 
All rash events were mild in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Study 105 Safety Set 
In Study 105, in IA1, 37 (7.3%) subjects and in IA2 50 (9.9%) had rash events. The rash events were 
exanthematous and mostly mild to moderate in severity. A serious rash event occurred in 
1 (0.2%) subject; study drug was discontinued, and the event resolved. Five (1.0%) subjects had rash 
events that led to treatment interruption.  
The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males: 27 (10.8%) female subjects and 23 
(9.0%) male subjects had rash events. Of the 94 female subjects taking hormonal therapy during the 
study, 12 (12.8%) had rash events; of the 157 female subjects not taking hormonal therapy during 
the study, 15 (9.6%) had rash events. Overall, the nature and severity of the rash events in Study 105 
were consistent with those in the parent studies (Studies 102 and 103). 
Table 51:Summary of AESI: Treatment-emergent Rash Events - Study 102 Safety Period, OL 
Safety Period 
Safety in subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
In IA2, rash events occurred in 42 (15.5%) subjects; these events were generally exanthematous 
rashes and mostly mild (32, 11.8%) to moderate (9, 3.3%) in severity. The exposure-adjusted event 
rate for rash events was lower in this subset of subjects in Study 105 than in the Study 102 VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group (18.90 versus 29.95 events/100PY). Three (1.1%) subjects had rash events that 
were serious. Four (1.5%) subjects had rash events that led to treatment interruption.

Pooled Analysis of Phase 1 Studies in Healthy Subjects 
In the Any VX-445 group, 7 (3.7%) subjects had rash events, of whom 2 (1.0%) subjects discontinued 
study drug due to a rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity and nonserious. The 
median time to onset of rash events was 11.0 days (range: 10 to 19 days).  
Of the 7 subjects who had rash events in the Any VX-445 group, 4 were female subjects from Study 
002 (OC DDI), and 3 were male subjects. The incidence of rash events in female subjects in Study 002 
was 4 of 15 subjects (26.7%). 
In the placebo group, 1 (1.9%) subject had 2 rash events of dermatitis. The time to onset of the first 
event was 9 days. 
CK Elevation Events 
Study 102 Safety Set 
AEs of CK elevation occurred in 20 (9.9%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (18 with AEs of blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased, 1 with an AE of rhabdomyolysis, and 1 with both AE) and 
9 (4.5%) subjects in the placebo group (9 with AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased and 
1 also with an AE of rhabdomyolysis). The majority of subjects with CK elevation events had 
asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were preceded by exercise. The AEs were mostly 
mild or moderate; AEs were of severe intensity in 5 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and no 
subjects in the placebo group. One subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had an SAE of CK elevation 
(rhabdomyolysis). 
The 2 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with AEs of rhabdomyolysis presented with CK elevations, 
and neither subject had clinical features of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., kidney involvement, myoglobinuria). 
Before event onset, both subjects had performed strenuous exercise (power lifting and CrossFit). Both 
subjects resumed treatment following interruption. The 1 subject in the placebo group with an AE of 
rhabdomyolysis had increased CK as well as elevated blood myoglobin. Narratives for subjects who had 
AEs of rhabdomyolysis are provided. 
AEs of CK elevation led to study drug interruption in 3 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and no 
subjects in the placebo group. Most AEs of CK elevation in both treatment groups resolved without 
change to study drug dosing or after treatment interruption. No subjects discontinued treatment due 
to AEs of CK elevation in either treatment group.  
The mean CK concentration was variable over time in both groups. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 
increases from baseline in mean CK were observed. The mean (SD) increases in CK ranged from 
35.9 (245.6) U/L at Week 12 to 108.2 (650.2) U/L at Week 24. In the placebo group, there were no 
trends in CK. 
The majority of subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range. Twenty-
one (10.4%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had CK >5 × ULN, including 10 (5.0%) subjects 
with CK >10 × ULN. Ten subjects (5.0%) in the placebo group had CK >5 × ULN, including 3 subjects 
(1.5%) with CK >10 × ULN. The majority of subjects with elevations >10 × ULN had exercised before 
the elevations. 
Study 103 Safety Set 
No subjects had AEs of CK elevation. 
Increases from baseline in mean and median CK were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The 
greatest mean (SD) change (22.6 [171.0] U/L) was observed at Day 15.

Study 105 Safety Set 
In Study 105, AEs of CK elevation occurred in 31 (6.1%) subjects, none of whom had AEs of 
rhabdomyolysis. The exposure-adjusted event rate for AEs of CK elevation was lower in Study 105 
than in the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (8.90 versus 19.96 events/100PY) 
The AEs were mostly mild or moderate in severity. One subject had a serious CK elevation event 
following strenuous exercise, and the SAE resolved without changes to study drug dosing. Four (0.8%) 
subjects had an AE of CK elevation that led to treatment interruption, and no subjects discontinued 
treatment due to AEs of CK elevation.  
The majority of subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range. Forty-two (8.3%) 
subjects had CK >5 × ULN, including 16 (3.2%) subjects with CK >10 × ULN. 
Most subjects with CK elevations had asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were 
preceded by exercise. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology and Coagulation 
Mean concentrations of haematology parameters were variable over time in both groups. In the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, decreases from baseline in mean platelets, leukocytes, and neutrophils were 
observed; however, mean values of all 3 parameters remained within normal limits at all assessed 
time points. These findings are not considered clinically adverse and may be markers of reduced 
systemic inflammation. There were no trends observed in other haematology parameters in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in study 102 or in study 103 , There were no trends in coagulation 
assessments in either group in both studies 102 and 103.  
AEs related to haematology and coagulation were infrequent; none of the AEs were serious or led to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Other Serum Chemistry 
Selected serum chemistry laboratory assessments are discussed in events of specific interest There 
were no trends in other chemistry parameters. Overall, AEs related to other chemistry parameters 
were infrequent and had a similar overall incidence between treatment groups. None of these AEs were 
serious or led to treatment discontinuation, and none led to treatment interruption in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. 
Urinalysis 
There were no trends observed in the urinalysis results.  
Vital Signs 
In Study 102, increases from baseline in mean BP parameters were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group; increases from baseline ranged from 2.0 to 3.5 mm Hg for mean SBP and 1.1 to 1.9 mm Hg for 
mean DBP, without a trend of continued increase during the study. The proportion of subjects who had 
BP in the hypertensive range (i.e., SBP >140 mm Hg or DBP >90 mm Hg) on at least 2 occasions was 
similar between the treatment groups. There were few AEs of BP increase (1 subject in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 subjects in the placebo group). Given the similar incidence of subjects in the 
hypertensive range between treatment groups and occurrence of few AEs, the modest increase in 
mean BP in this normotensive population is unlikely to be clinically relevant. There were no meaningful 
changes in BP in Study 103 or the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 150/151 
 
 
 
 
In study 105, for subjects who received VX445/TEZ/IVA in Study 102, there was no further increase in 
mean BP with continued VX445/TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 105. For subjects who received placebo in 
Study 102 and received VX445/TEZ/IVA in Study 105, the increase in mean BP was generally similar to 
that observed in the VX445/TEZ/IVA group in Study 102. Few subjects (5 [1.0%] subjects) in Study 
105 had AEs of increased BP; all AEs were mild in severity, and none required study drug interruption 
or discontinuation. 
In Studies 102 and 103, decreases from baseline in mean pulse rate (up to 4.3 bpm in Study 102 and 
up to 5.5 bpm in Study 103) were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. No subjects had AEs of 
decreased HR. The decrease in mean pulse rate is not considered to be clinically relevant. There were 
no meaningful changes in pulse rate in the Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects. 
In IA2, there were also 83 subjects that had tachycardia, and of 20 patients the tachycardia was 
accompanied with an increase of heartrate > 20 beats/min in subjects.  
In all studies, there were no trends in temperature, respiratory rate, or pulse oximetry. 
Electrocardiogram Data 
In Studies 102 and 103, decreases from baseline in mean HR were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group. In study 102, the mean (SD) decreases in HR ranged from -3.7 (12.3) bpm at Week 16 
to -5.8 (12.4) bpm at 2 hours post-dose on Day 15. In the placebo group, changes from baseline in 
mean HR were minimal. In study 103, the greatest mean (SD) change in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (-
5.4 [8.8] bpm) was observed at Week 4 (compared to 1.9 [9.3] bpm in the TEZ/IVA group). 
AEs related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac disorders were infrequent with a similar overall 
incidence across treatment groups. None of the AEs related to ECG findings or relevant cardiac 
disorders were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
High-precision QT analysis (in Study 001) and a thorough QT/QTc study (Study 009) were conducted 
for VX-445 and its metabolite M23-445. Both studies showed a lack of effect of VX-445 on QTc.  
In separate thorough QT studies for the TEZ and IVA clinical development programs (Studies 661-010 
and 770-008, respectively), TEZ and IVA did not prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects to 
any clinically relevant extent at doses up to 3 times the maximum recommended dose. 
Post-dose Spirometry 
Post-dose spirometry was assessed in healthy subjects at approximately 6 hours post-dose on Days 1 
and 9 in Study 001 (Parts B and C), and in CF subjects at 5 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 15 in 
Study 001 (Parts D, E, and F). There were no clinically relevant decreases in post-dose spirometry. 
Overall, the post-dose ppFEV1 values showed no evidence of decline from the pre-dose ppFEV1 at any 
assessment time points for both healthy and CF subjects. 
Ophthalmologic Examinations 
Due to nonclinical findings of cataracts/lens opacities in a study involving IVA monotherapy and the 
implementation of recommended ophthalmologic examinations in paediatric patients treated with IVA, 
ophthalmologic examinations were performed in the VX-445 clinical program in subjects <18 years of 
age. 
In Study 102, one (0.5%) subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group had AEs of cataract cortical and 
lenticular opacity; this subject had a history of CF-related diabetes and concomitant use of 
corticosteroids. One (0.5%) subject in the placebo group had an AE of cataract; this subject had 
concomitant use of corticosteroids. Both AEs were mild in severity, not clinically significant, and did not 
Assessment report

require treatment or lead to interruption or discontinuation of study drug. In Study 103, follow-up 
ophthalmologic examinations were not required given the short study duration. 
Overall, the ophthalmological examination (OE) data are consistent with previous experience with IVA 
and IVA-containing regimens. 
Safety in special populations 
A summary of the safety profile of subjects in subgroups of F508del-CFTR mutation with F/MF and F/F 
in the cumulative safety data across Studies 102, 103, and 105. Across the F/MF and F/F subgroups, 
the majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity, and most were consistent with common 
manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age 
and older. The most common AEs (incidence of ≥15% of subjects in any subgroup) were similar across 
the F/MF and F/F subgroups. Overall, the safety results were similar between the F/MF and F/F 
subgroups, and no new safety concerns were identified. 
The safety profile is generally also similar across subgroups of patients, including sex, ppFEV1, 
geographic regions, and genotypes. 
The safety results were generally consistent in the subgroups subjects ≥18 years of age and subjects 
≥12 to <18 years of age. There were no patients > 65 year in study 102 or study 103. 
Immunological events 
In Study 102, 4 (2.0%) subjects in each group had an immunological event. In Study 105 IA2, 22 
(4.3%) subjects had AEs in the immune system disorders SOC, mainly associated with external 
allergens (e.g., environmental, animal, food) and were not considered study-drug-related. One subject 
had a nonserious AE of anaphylactic reaction that was caused by an allergic reaction to cashews. The 
event resolved without change to study drug dosing and was assessed by the investigator as not 
related to study drug (See Table 52).

Discontinuation due to AES 
In Study 102, two subjects (both in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group) discontinued study drug due to an AE, 
one subject with a non-serious AE of rash and one subject with a medical history of hepatic cirrhosis 
because of a SAE of portal hypertension. Both events were assessed by the investigator as being of 
moderate severity and possibly related to study drug. 
In Study 103, no subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation.   
In IA1 of Study 105, 6 (1.2%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, and 7 (1.4%) 
subjects in IA2. Three subjects discontinued due to AEs of transaminase elevation. The other subjects 
discontinued treatment due to AEs of depression (1 subject), rash (1 subject), and tinnitus and 
contusion (1 subject) and additionally in IA2 hepatic encephalopathy (1 subject). For the subject with 
non-serious AEs of tinnitus and contusion, study drug was discontinued, and the events were ongoing 
at time of the data cut. For the other subjects the AE were resolved after discontinuation of study 
drug. For the subject who discontinued VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment due to an SAE of hepatic 
encephalopathy the event resolved with treatment. The subject had a history of hepatic cirrhosis, 
portal hypertension with gastric varices, and thrombocytopenia. 
In the Cumulative Safety Set, 10 (2%) subjects discontinued study drug due to AEs, with 4 (0.8%) 
subjects discontinuing due to LFT elevations and 2 (0.4%) subjects discontinuing due to rash events.   
Assessment report

In the set of subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks, none of the subjects were 
discontinued from study medication.  
In the Healthy Subjects, in the Any VX-445 group, 2 (1.0%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation, both of which were rash events. One subject with rash generalized who received VX-
445 in Study 009, a thorough QT/QTc study and one subject with dermatitis who received VX-
445/TEZ/IVA in Study 001, a single- and multiple-dose escalation first-in-human study.  
AEs Leading to Interruption of Study Drug 
In Study 102, 29 subjects (19 subjects [9.4%] in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 10 subjects [5.0%] 
in the placebo group) interrupted study drug due to an AE. Of the 19 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group, 16 subjects resumed study drug treatment in Study 102, and 3 subjects enrolled in extension 
Study 105 while study drug was interrupted.  
In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, AEs that led to treatment interruption that occurred in ≥2 subjects were 
rash, ALT increased, infective PEx of CF, influenza, and rhabdomyolysis. In the placebo group, ALT 
increased led to treatment interruption in ≥2 subjects. 
In Study 103, no subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption.   
In study 105, 29 (5.7%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. Events that occurred 
in≥2 subjects were ALT increased, AST increased, rash, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, GGT 
increased, and blood creatine phosphokinase increased. Other AEs that lead to interruption were 
pruritus generalised, abdominal pain upper, constipation, duodenitis, gastric haemorrhage, 
cholecystitis acute, depression, blood bilirubin increased, liver function test increased, pityriasis rosea, 
rash maculo-papular, infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, bacterial vaginosis, hand-
foot-and-mouth disease, tendonitis, pulmonary haemorrhage, pyrexia, burning sensation, haematuria.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure  
The core safety analyses in CF subjects evaluated data from Studies 102 and 103, and an interim 
analysis (IA2) of the open-label extension Study 105 as separate sets. Study 102 provided the main 
safety data. In addition to the core safety analyses, a Cumulative Safety Set and a subset of subjects 
in the Cumulative Safety Set who received ≥ 48 weeks of treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were 
presented. Overall, these sets together provide a sufficient overview of the safety profile of Kaftrio. 
Study 105 is ongoing and interim analyses (IA1 cut-off date 10 July 2019, IA2 cut-off date 31 October 
2019) were submitted during this procedure. Further safety data will be provided post approval which 
is acceptable. This is adequately described in the RMP. 
In the Phase 3 program, 510 subjects received at least 1 dose of VX-445/TEZ/IVA, with a total 
exposure of approximately 496.6 patient-years. In the Cumulative Safety Set (parent Studies 102 or 
103 and/or during Study 105), 12 subjects had an exposure of ≤ 24 weeks, 229 subject > 24 ≤ 48 
weeks, and 271 subjects ≥ 48 weeks. This is considered acceptable to assess long-term safety.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths  
Pivotal placebo-controlled studies, Study 102 and Study 103 
Nearly all patients in both arms in study 102 experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (93.1% 
of patients in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm and 96.0% in the placebo arm). In study 103 these numbers 
are much lower, 58.2% in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the TEZ/IVA group, likely because 
of the shorter duration of this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common 
illnesses. In study 102, AEs occurring in ≥8% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an 
incidence ≥1% higher than in the placebo group were headache (17.3% versus 14.9%), diarrhoea 
(12.9% versus 7.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.9% versus 10.9%), abdominal pain (9.9% 
versus 6.0%), alanine transaminase (ALT) increased (9.9% versus 3.5%), aspartate transaminase 
(AST) increased (9.4% versus 2.0%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (9.4% versus 4.5%), 
nasal congestion (9.4% versus 7.5%), rash (8.9% versus 4.5%), and rhinorrhoea (8.4% versus 
3.0%). All of these are included as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Initially, AEs occurring in ≥8% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher 
than in the placebo group were considered an ADR. However, this margin is considered arbitrary and 
generous. Upon request by CHMP, additional analyses with more stringent margins were provided. Two 
additional ADRs occurred in ≥5% of subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% 
higher than in the placebo group compared to the cut-off level of ≥8%, i.e. rhinitis and influenza. 
Compared to the cut-off level of ≥5%, 8 additional ADRs occurred in ≥3% of subjects in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group with an incidence ≥1% higher than in the placebo group, i.e. abdominal pain 
upper, flatulence, hypoglycaemia, acne, dizziness, pruritus, wheezing and abnormal breathing. All of 
these have been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC as ADRs. Blood pressure increased is also 
included in section 4.8 of the SmPC as an ADR. 
Results in Study 103 were reasonably similar as in the study 102 Safety set. In Study 103, the incidence 
of subjects with at least 1 AE was lower than in Study 102 but similar in both treatment groups (58.2% 
in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the TEZ/IVA group). The different duration of the studies 
may be likely the reason for the differences observed in incidence of AEs.  
In Study 102, related AEs occurred more frequently in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA (47.5%) compared to the 
placebo group (25.9%). These most frequent related in order of highest frequency are sputum 
increased (6.9%) ALT increased (5.9%), AST increased (5.4%) and rash (5.4%). These related AEs 
are also more frequent than in placebo. In study 103 Safety Set, more subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group (12 (21.8%)) had related AEs compared subjects in the placebo group (9 (17.3%)). The most 
frequent related in order of highest frequency was respiration abnormal (5.5%) while all other events 
were only observed in 1 or 2 patients.   
Overall the numbers of Grade 3 or 4 AEs were low. In study 102, 19 (9.4%) subjects had severe AEs 
and no subjects had life-threatening AEs in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, while 14 (7.0%) subjects had 
severe AEs and 1 (0.5%) subject had a life-threatening AE of neuroglycopenia in the placebo group. 
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased (2%) and alanine aminotransferase increased (1%) and 
aspartate aminotransferase increased (1%) occurred ≥ 1%. In the Study 103 Safety Set, only 1 
(1.9%) subject in the TEZ/IVA group had a severe AE (musculoskeletal pain).  
Eight cases of haemoptysis were classified as possibly related to study drug all in patients treated with 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA. Of note, an additional case of severe gastric haemorrhage (unlikely related) was 
reported. Two additional cases, one each of ocular retrobulbar haemorrhage (possibly related), 
menorrhagia (possibly related) and 3 cases of vaginal haemorrhage (not related) were reported. There 
were no clear markers of increased tendency to bleed. There was no evidence of increased 
prothrombin times, platelets decreased were reported in 6.7% of subjects but no subjects reported 
decreases ≥25 to <50 (10^9/L). At present it was considered premature to reflect these in the SmPC.  
The event rate for influenza was 3E/100PY in the placebo arm and 16E/100PY in VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm 
in Study 102, while it was 4.6E/100PY and 6.9E/100PY in the long term OLS and Cumulative safety 
analyses respectively. The difference between placebo arm and in VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm in Study 102 
was not sufficiently explained. On the basis of this analysis, and also taking into consideration the 
analysis of AEs occurring in ≥5%, and ≥3% of subjects, Influenza has been included as an ADR in

section 4.8 of the SmPC. The applicant committed to monitoring reporting rates of influenza in 
subsequent PSURs and the applicant agreed to incorporate available data on influenza in the planned 
PASS. As measures other than routine pharmacovigilance is being proposed to monitor this event 
“Susceptibility for influenza virus infections” is classified as an important identified risk in the RMP.  
Analyses of the duration of a specific event were performed. There was no apparent increase in the 
incidence of individual AEs over time in subjects who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA, as most the most 
common AEs were highest during the 0- to 8-week interval.  
In study 102, the incidence of SAEs was lower in VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (28 (13.9%)) than in the 
placebo group (42 (20.9%)). Overall, the SAEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations of 
CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects. Rash and influenza occurred in ≥2 subjects in any 
group and were more common in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than the placebo group. In study 103, 1 
subject had an SAE of infective pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF and 1 subject had an SAE of rash 
in VX-445/TEZ/IVA group while 1 (1.9%) subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF in the TEZ/IVA 
group.  
No deaths were reported in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA clinical development program.  
Long term open-label safety study, Study 105 Safety Set, Cumulative safety Set and safety in patients 
who received VX-445/TEZ/IVA for at least 48 weeks 
The long-term safety Study 105 Safety Set and Cumulative safety Set showed decreased incidences of 
(related) AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
compared to Study 102 Safety Set.  
In the Study 105 Safety Set the (related) AEs and SAE were mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects 12 years of age and older. A total 
of 169 (33.4%) subjects had AEs considered related or possibly related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In addition 
to already observed related AE in study 103, photosensitivity reaction was observed in 7 subjects, but 
all resolved with continued study drug treatment. Furthermore, the exposure-adjusted event rate for 
the AE of photosensitivity reaction overall was similar in Study 105 and in the placebo group of Study 
102. Taking these arguments into account there is insufficient information to include photosensitivity 
as and ADR. Photosensitivity will be reviewed in subsequent PSURs. 
The exposure-adjusted event rates for the majority of AEs were similar or lower in Study 105 than in 
the Study 102 VX-445/TEZ/IVA group apart from cough, fatigue, haemoptysis and sinus congestion 
that occurred more frequently in Study 105.   
In Study 105, 51 (10.1%) subjects had severe (Grade 3) AEs and 2 (0.4%) subjects had life-
threatening (Grade 4) AEs. Only pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (3.2%) occurred >1% as 
Grade 3 and 4 AE. The two life-threatening AEs were an event of non-related suicide attempt and an 
event pulmonary haemorrhage, which was considered to be possibly related to VX-445/TEZ/IVA.  
In both the overall cumulative analysis and the 48-week cumulative exposure analysis, Exposure-
adjusted analyses of event rates in Study 102 showed a decrease in the rates of the majority of related 
AEs with longer-term treatment compared with Study 105. 
In the set of subjects who receive VX-445 for at least 48 weeks, 41 (15.1%) subjects had at least 1 AE 
that was Grade 3 or 4 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 events that occurred in ≥2 subjects were infective PEx 
of CF (10 subjects), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (8 subjects), DIOS (4 subjects), AST 
increased (4 subjects), ALT increased (3 subjects), GGT increased (2 subjects), gastritis (2 subjects), 
and influenza (2 subjects).

The safety profile of subjects in subgroups of F508del-CFTR mutation with F/MF and F/F in the 
cumulative safety set was broadly comparable across the F/MF and F/F subgroups respectively.  
Adverse events of special interest  
Transaminase elevations are common in CF and have been observed in patients receiving IVA 
monotherapy, TEZ/IVA, and VX-445/TEZ/IVA. In the pivotal VX-445/TEZ/IVA, exclusion criteria for 
patients with pre-existing liver function impairments were more stringent compared to the Orkambi 
trials and Symkevi. In the VX-445/TEZ/IVA trials patients were excluded when 1 out of the defined 
impairments were present instead of 2 (Symkevi) or 3 (Orkambi) trial.  
In Study 102, the incidence of transaminase elevation adverse events was 2-3 times higher in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group. The vast majority of the events were non-severe, non-
serious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. In addition, only one event of portal 
hypertension in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA was a SAE, occurring in a subject with a history of hepatic 
cirrhosis, that led to discontinuation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Results from Study 103 and Study 105 were generally consistent with those from Study 102. In 
addition, increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, 
with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than direct bilirubin. In the placebo group, changes from 
baseline in mean total bilirubin were minimal. AEs associated with bilirubin elevation occurred in 10 
(5.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.0%) subjects in the placebo group. One 
subject had an AE of bilirubin elevation that was not serious and led to treatment interruption.  
Consequently, a warning regarding the potential risk for elevated transaminases has been included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC, similarly to Kalydeco and Orkambi, which is agreed by CHMP. As in the RMP 
clinical outcomes are defined for the identified elevated transaminases, hepatotoxicity is included as a 
potential serious risk. VX-445/TEZ/IVA is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment and should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Only in case of a clear 
medical need for treatment with Kaftrio and after weighing the benefits and risks of such treatment, 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA may be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment applying a 25% dose 
reduction. Further data are awaited post marketing in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(study 007) described as category 3 in the RMP. 
Rash events have been seen in subjects treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA including in the Phase 1. In 
Study 102, there was a higher incidence of rash events in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (10.9%, 22 
subjects) than in the placebo group (6.5%, 13 subjects). Most rashes occurred within the first 3 weeks 
of study drug treatment. Serious rash events occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group, while in 1 (0.5%) subject in the placebo group. There was also an increase in the incidence of 
rash in female subjects taking hormonal therapy compared with those not taking hormonal therapy; 
the increase was larger in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group. Therefore, a role for 
hormonal therapy in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. This is adequately addressed in the 
SmPC section 4.4.  
AEs of CK elevation occurred more frequently in subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to the 
placebo group. The majority were asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were preceded by 
exercise.  Most  AEs  of  CK  elevation  resolved  without  change  to  study  drug  dosing  or  after  treatment 
interruption. Two subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with AEs of rhabdomyolysis presented with CK 
elevations,  and  neither  subject  had  clinical  features  of  rhabdomyolysis  (e.g.,  kidney  involvement, 
myoglobinuria). Both subjects had performed strenuous exercise (power lifting and CrossFit), which was 
likely the cause of the CK elevations.  
No clinically meaningful trends in the respiratory-related AEs or post-dose spirometry data were 
observed during phase I in healthy volunteers and CF patients at the proposed dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 157/158 
 
 
 
In Study 102, small increases from baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diatolic Blood 
Pressure (DBP) were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group were observed.   
Safety in special populations  
No patients in the Phase 3 clinical studies were aged 65 years or older at screening. This is acceptable 
when considering the severity of the disease and life-expectancy in the investigated CF mutations 
(homozygote F508del and heterozygote F508del/MF).  
The safety profile is generally also similar across subgroups of patients, including sex, ppFEV1, 
geographic regions, and genotypes. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No clinically relevant differences in safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA between patients ≥12 to <18 
years of age and ≥18 years of age have been observed. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
With the addition of VX-445 to TEZ/IVA, an increase in hepatic toxicity, influenza and rash were 
identified with the addition of TEZ to IVA. These safety events can be handled in the clinical practice 
and have been adequately described in the SmPC and RMP. Differences in the safety profile of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA across studies could be explained by the difference in exposure during the studies. 
Overall, VX-445/TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to AEs.  
The results of the interim analyses of the long-term safety Study 105 are considered adequate to 
support approval in F/F and F/MF populations. The study is ongoing and further analyses will be 
submitted post approval and further characterise safety in CF patients. The ongoing study 007, in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment will provide further information to assess the use 
of Kaftrio in these populations in view of the concerns related to hepatotoxicity defined as an important 
potential risk in the RMP.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21 October 2019. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of elexacaftor with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers elexacaftor / tezacaftor / ivacaftor contained in the 
fixed combination medicinal product – Kaftrio to be a new active substance as this FDC is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kaftrio (elexacaftor / tezacaftor / ivacaftor) 
is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by 
mutations in the CFTR gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell 
surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of 
salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 162/163 
 
 
 
results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Lung disease is the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in people with CF. F508del, is the most common disease-causing mutation 
(84.7% of the individuals in the US and 81.1% of the individuals in Europe)6,7.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Two types of CF therapies exist. The use CF therapies that target the symptoms of the disease (such 
as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics), in combination with CFTR modulators (i.e. 
correctors and potentiators) is recommended to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of 
infections and exacerbations; and improve quality of life. 
Correctors (such as tezacaftor and VX-445), facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of mutant 
CFTR to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced chloride 
transport. CFTR potentiators (like ivacaftor) enhance the channel gating activity of the CFTR which is 
delivered to the cell surface (by correctors).  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, 
TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with specific mutations.  
The claimed indication by the Applicant was as follows: “Kaftrio (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) is indicated in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 
aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.” 
The proposed indication covers F/F genotypes, F/MF ‘minimal function’ genotypes, F/G ‘gating’ 
genotypes, and F/RF ‘residual function’ genotypes. It comprises subpopulations in which approved 
modulator therapies are available (F508del homozygous patients (F/F), patient heterozygous for 
F508del and a specific residual function mutation (F/RF) or a specific gating mutation (F/G). 
Nevertheless, these treatments do not cure the disease and more efficacious treatments could fulfil 
this gap in these patients. For the populations heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function 
mutation (F/MF) no treatment is available, which is an unmet need in this subpopulation. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy and safety is obtained from three trials. All three trials investigated the 
triple VX-445 200 mg/tezacaftor 100mg/ivacaftor 150mg morning dose in combination with ivacaftor 
150 mg as evening dose. 
Study 102 in CF patients 12 years and older is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study in subjects heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and a minimal 
function mutation. Patients with minimal function mutation were defined as patients with Class I 
mutations that predicted no CFTR protein being produced (including nonsense mutations, canonical 
splice mutations, and insertion/deletion frameshift mutations both small (≤3 nucleotide) and non-small 
(>3 nucleotide), as well as patients with missense mutations which results in CFTR protein that does 
not transport chloride and is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ ivacaftor in vitro.

A total of 403 subjects received at least one dose of study drug. Placebo was used as control treatment 
because no CFTR modulators were approved. The primary endpoint was absolute change from baseline 
in ppFEV1, which was accompanied by several key secondary endpoints (pulmonary exacerbations, 
SwCl, CFQ-R RD, BMI).  
Study 103 in CF patients 12 years and older is a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, TEZ/IVA-
controlled, parallel-group study in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. A total of 107 
subjects received at least one dose of study drug. TEZ/IVA (Symkevi) was used a control treatment, as 
this is an approved therapy in this patient population. The primary endpoint was absolute change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 at week 4, which was accompanied by key secondary endpoints on SwCl and CFQ-R 
RD score.  
Study 105 is an ongoing open-label rollover study that enrolled subjects from study 102 (n=400) and 
103 (n=107). This study is designed to support long-term safety (primary objective) and maintenance 
of efficacy (secondary objective). The Interim analysis 2 (IA2) was submitted to allow evaluation of 
long-term safety of F/F and F/MF patients. Efficacy data, with an additional 36 week or 24-week 
treatment, are submitted for F/F patients which were enrolled in study 103 and for F/MF patients 
enrolled in study 102, respectively. 
The core safety analyses consisted of separate analyses of studies 102 and 103, and the second 
interim analysis (IA2) of the open-label extension Study 105. The safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
was mainly derived from Study 102. Safety data from Studies 102 and 103 were not pooled because of 
the substantial differences in the design of the two studies. In addition, analyses of the Cumulative 
Safety Set and a subset of subjects in the Cumulative Safety Set who received ≥ 48 weeks of 
treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were submitted.  
The Study 102 Safety Set contains all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. The 
Study 103 Safety includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in the Study 103 
Treatment Period (i.e., does not include subjects who were only dosed in the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period). 
The Study 105 Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in Study 
105. The Cumulative Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA during the parent studies 102 or 103 and/or during study 105.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Rationale for the VX445 dose in the triple combination 
 For CF patients 18 years and older with an F/MF mutation three doses (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) 
of VX-445 were tested in combination with the approved dosage of TEZ/IVA. ppFEV1 and SwCl 
changes from baseline with the TC are compared to changes from baseline with placebo. A difference 
in ppFEV1 compared to placebo was seen for all dose tested strengths (11.1, 7.8 and 13.8, for 50, 100 
and 200mg respectively). For SwCl, an improvement (decline) compared to placebo was also detected 
(-36.1, -31.0, -36.9 for 50, 100 and 200mg respectively). The best efficacy results were observed with 
the 200 mg dose in all cases: efficacy data, exposure-response models and simulated efficacy data for 
FEV1 and SwCl. 
For CF patients 18 years and older with an F/F mutation, only the final 200 mg dose of VX-445 was 
investigated. A benefit with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to TEZ/IVA is seen (ppFEV1:10.6%; SwCl: -
40.4 mmol/L). 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF genotype (study 102) VX-445/TEZ/IVA showed an absolute 
change in ppFEV1 through week 24 between the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo groups of 14.3% (CI 
95%:  12.7 – 15.8; p<0.0001) in favour of the triple combination. A comparable difference was

Page 164/165 
 
 
 
observed at week 4 already (13.7; CI 95% 12.0 - 15.3; p<0.0001). Approximately 80% patients 
treated with the TC have an increase in ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 15% in the placebo group.  
Several key secondary endpoints were analysed. For pulmonary exacerbations, the rate ratio was 0.37 
(95% CI: 0.25 – 0.55, p<0.0001) in favour of VX-445/TEZ/IVA, corresponding to a reduction of 63%. 
The hazard ratio for time-to-first pulmonary exacerbations was also in favour of the triple combination 
(HR: 0.34; 95% CI 0.22, 0.52; p<0.0001). For changes in SwCl from baseline, a stable reduction of -
41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4 to -39.3; p< 0.0001) through week 24 compared to placebo was 
observed. A higher CRQ-R RD score was observed in the TC arm compared to the placebo arm (20.2 
points; 95% CI 17.5,23.0; p<0.0001). All other CFQ-R domains indicated an improvement with the TC 
compared to placebo. Last, an absolute change of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.23; p<0.0001) compared to 
placebo was seen in BMI.  
All other endpoints showed also a positive effect for VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to placebo. 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline 
use of common CF medications. 
An ad-hoc subgroup analysis was performed on patients included based in genetic criterion 1 (likely no 
protein translated) and on criterion 2 (missense not responding the TEZ and/or IVA in vitro). Class 1 
(MF) mutant patients showed an absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 of 14.8% comparing the 
triple combination with placebo. The missense mutant patients showed a difference in ppFEV1 of 
12.9%. Further subdivision of these genotypes (nonsense, splicing, and indel-frameshift) and FRT 
responsiveness show reasonably similar results. Subjects treated with the TC in parent study continued 
to show a comparable benefit at 24 weeks (study 102) and through 48 weeks (study 105) of 
treatment, respectively (ppFEV1: 13.9 vs 14.3; SwCl: -42.2 vs -49.0; CFQ-R RD: 17.5 vs 20.1). 
Patients which received placebo in the parent study showed similar benefits (ppFEV1: 14.9, SwCL: -
50.3, CFQ-R: 19.2) in these parameters after 24 weeks of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
With the results from study 105, data for exacerbations and nutritional status became available. With 
regard to the number of PEx an estimated event rate per year of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.24-0.44) is 
anticipated. With regard to the nutritional status, a benefit compared to baseline is observed for all 
parameters (change in BMI, BMI z-score and body weight). 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype (study 103/105). 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA showed an absolute change in ppFEV1 at week 4 between the VX-445/TEZ/IVA and 
TEZ/IVA groups of 10.0% (7.4 – 12.6; p<0.0001) in favor of the triple combination. Approximately 
70% patients treated with the TC have an increase in ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 13% in the TEZ/IVA 
group. 
For the key secondary endpoint, change in SwCl from baseline, a reduction of -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: 
-50.1 to -40.1; p< 0.0001) at week 4 was observed after treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to 
TEZ/IVA. Key secondary endpoint, change in CRQ-R RD score, improved significantly in the TC arm 
compared to the TEZ/IVA arm (17.4 points; 95% CI 11.8,23.0; p<0.0001). All other CFQ-R domains 
indicated an improvement with the TC compared to TEZ/IVA. 
Ad hoc analyses on BMI and weight also demonstrate of beneficial effect of the TC over TEZ/IVA. 
Consistent benefits in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups: age, sex, baseline lung function, region, P. aeruginosa infection, and baseline use of 
common CF medications. 
Subject treated with the TC in parent study continued to have a similar benefit at 4 weeks (study 103) 
and through 36 (ppFEV1) or 24 weeks (SwCL and CFQ-R) (study 105) of treatment, respectively 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 165/166 
 
 
 
(ppFEV1: 10.4 vs 11.9; SwCl: -43.4 vs -47.2; CFQ-R RD: 16vs 14.3). Patients which received placebo 
in the parent study showed comparable benefits (ppFEV1: 12.8, SwCL: -49.4, CFQ-R: 13.8) in these 
parameters after 36/24 weeks of VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
With regard to the number of PEx an estimated event rate per year of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.20-0.45) and a 
probability of event-free survival of 0.859 (95% CI: 0.777-0.912) is anticipated. With regard to the 
nutritional status, a benefit compared to baseline is observed for all parameters (change in BMI, BMI z-
score and body weight). 
Real world data from the US CFFPR for F/F showed consistent results with what was seen in the clinical 
study 103. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/RF and F/G genotype (real world data). 
No clinical data was provided for the F/RF and F/G genotypes. Real world data from the US CFFPR for 
F/RF and F/G patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA were however provided towards the end of the 
assessment. Based on the available data, improvements in ppFEV1 were seen in the F/G and F/RF 
populations of 4.3% and 2.7% respectively, compared to a baseline ppFEV1 measurement before the 
start of VX-445/TEZ/IVA therapy. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The applicant hypothesis that if a modulator has a large effect on the F508del-CFTR, the presence of a 
single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a clinical benefit (as defined by the F/any treatment 
paradigm) could not be demonstrated unambiguously, as it is theoretically still possible that some of 
the MF mutants may make a minor contribution to the CFTR-mediated chloride transport upon 
treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA.  
With regards to the dose of VX-445 in the triple combination, no clear dose response, has been 
observed, most likely due to small numbers in the subgroups, as the 100 mg arm showed a lower 
response than the 50 mg and 200 mg arms.  
The same dose is proposed for adolescents from age 12 years and older to adulthood. There were no 
Phase 1/2 PK adolescent data to inform the dose choice, nor was there modelling/simulation of Phase 
1/2 data in advance of Phase 3. Pop-PK analysis of PK data from Phase 1/2 and 3 confirmed that age 
and weight were not significant co-variates and clearance in adults and adolescents was similar. 
However, while the lowest weight included in the Pop-PK analysis was 29kg, there were only minimal 
data in CF subjects <40 kg in the Phase 3 studies which prevents possibility to make a robust 
conclusion about exposure at lower extremes of weight. Further data on PK in low weight patients is 
expected (study 106) in due course as agreed with the applicant. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF and F/F genotype (study 102 and study 103) 
In the F/MF patients, placebo was used as a comparator and in F/F TEZ/IVA was used as comparator. 
Therefore, the added benefit over VX-445 monotherapy or VX-445/IVA has not been investigated in a 
clinical setting.  
In study 102, the Applicant’ definition of an MF mutation (1) no protein or (2) not responding to TEZ, 
IVA or TEZ/IVA in vitro) is different when compared to the standard MF definition (Class I, II and III 
mutations). An ad-hoc subgroup analysis showed a consistent benefit in the patient included based on 
criterion 1 (and in the nonsense, splicing and indel frameshift subgroups). However, some small 
uncertainties remain on whether all criterion (1) mutants do not form a protein.   
Not all known MF mutations can be tested in clinical trial setting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020

CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype (study 103/105). 
Stratification according to ppFEV1 was applied on the ppFEV1 measurements taken after at least 13 
days of TEZ/IVA run-in, rather than the screening ppFEV1 values. These ppFEV1 measurements are 
influenced by whether the patients were Vertex CFTR modulator naïve or experienced. The data 
suggests that the screening period of 4 weeks may not have been sufficient for CFTR-modulator naïve 
patients randomized to TEZ/IVA to derive the full benefit of this treatment by time of baseline ppFEV1 
assessment. Consequently, it is considered that the magnitude of the treatment effect of VX-
445/TEZ/IVA vs TEZ/IVA in the overall study 102 population may be overestimated and that the 
treatment effect estimate obtained in the CFTR-modulator experienced patients is relevant to 
prescribers (LS mean 7.8%, 95% CI (4.8,10.8)). Therefore, this has been included in Section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
There are no controlled data after 4 weeks for F/F patients due to the short study treatment duration 
and limited open label extension data from the 107 patients (F/F) that enrolled from parent Study 103 
are provided. 
Effect on number of PEx can only be determined by data from study 105, without a control group or 
event rate at baseline present. When comparing the observed PEx data for study 103/105 to the data 
from the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group in study 102 these are considered similar. Therefore, the presented 
exacerbation results for F/F patients from study 105, are likely to be supportive for the benefit seen 
with the TC.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/RF and F/G genotype (real world data) 
The registry data presented is in itself limited and not sufficiently detailed, and as such raised 
questions. For example, the exact modulator therapy used, the duration of use is not known, as well as 
included specific genotypes and individual patient efficacy data not present. Unavailability of such 
information is inherent to obtaining data from a registry but leads to questioning whether the patients 
in the analysis set can be considered sufficiently representative of the overall F/G and F/RF populations 
to draw conclusions on these populations. Bearing in mind the limitations and questions arising from 
the registry data, the magnitude of the additional response from treatment with VX445/TEZ/IVA over 
prior CFTR therapies is not overwhelming. It is unexpected that the F/G group had a greater gain than 
that seen in the F/RF population. Indeed, in view of the limited efficacy observed in clinical trials for 
F/RFs patients treated with TEZ/IVA  compared those patients with G/any mutations treated with IVA, 
it would be considered that F/RF group should have had more potential for improvement with 
VX445/TEZ/IVA  by treating the F allele. Overall, due to the uncertainties on the patients included and 
the effect size seen, these data cannot be accepted as the main data source for the F/G and F/RF 
populations 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
As most patients were included in Study 102, the safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA was mainly 
determined by Study 102.  
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for nearly all patients in both arms in the Study 102 Safety 
Set (93.1% of patients in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm vs. 96.0% in the placebo arm). TEAEs with an 
incidence of at least 8% in either treatment group and in VX-445/TEZ/IVA >1% higher than in placebo 
were headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, alanine transaminase 
(ALT) increased, aspartate transaminase (AST) increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, 
nasal congestion, rash, and rhinorrhoea. Important AEs observed with incidence rates ≥ 3% and ≥1% 
more frequent than placebo are influenza, wheezing and hypoglycaemia.    
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 167/168 
 
 
 
The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 12 years and older were headache 
(17.3%), diarrhoea (12.9%) and upper respiratory tract infection (11.9%).  
Adverse drug reactions were mostly mild to moderate and resolved without requiring treatment 
discontinuation.   
Related AEs occurred in 5.0% of patients treated with VX-445/TEZ/IVA and in 3.0% treated with 
placebo; 42.6% of the subject in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 22.9% subjects in the placebo group 
had an AE assessed by the investigator as possibly related. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported for 9.4% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 7.5% (placebo) of patients; infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (4.5%, placebo) and blood creatine increased (2.0%, VX-
445/TEZ/IVA), ALT increased (1%, VX-445/TEZ/IVA), and AST  increased (1%, VX-445/TEZ/IVA) were 
the only Grade 3 or 4 AEs that had an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group.  
SAEs were reported for 13.9% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 20.9 % (placebo). The SAEs that occurred in 
≥1% of patients in either treatment group were infective PEx of CF (5.4% vs. 16.4%), haemoptysis 
(1.0% vs. 1.5%) and rash (1.0% vs. 0.5%) and influenza (1.5% vs 0%). Related SAEs occurred in 
3.0% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 1.0% (placebo). No related SAEs occurred in 2 or more patients in either 
treatment group. 
Transaminase elevations are common in CF patients receiving IVA monotherapy, TEZ/IVA, and VX-
445/TEZ/IVA. In the pivotal VX-445/TEZ/IVA, exclusion criteria for patients with pre-existing liver 
function impairments were more stringent compared to the Orkambi trials and Symkevi. The incidence 
of transaminase elevation adverse events was 2-3 times higher in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than in 
the placebo group. The majority of the events were non-severe, non-serious and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation. Increases from baseline in mean total bilirubin were also observed in the 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA group, with a greater increase in indirect bilirubin than direct bilirubin, while in the 
placebo group, changes from baseline in mean total bilirubin were minimal. AEs associated with 
bilirubin elevation occurred in 10 (5.0%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.0%) subjects 
in the placebo group. None of the AEs of bilirubin elevation were serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
Rash occurred more frequently in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group (10.9%, 22 subjects) than in the placebo 
group (6.5%, 13 subjects). Most rashes occurred within the first 3 weeks of study drug treatment. 
Serious rash events occurred in 3 (1.5%) subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to 1 (0.5%) 
subject in the placebo group.  
AEs of CK elevation occurred more frequently in subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group compared to 
the placebo group. The majority were asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were 
preceded by exercise. The 2 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group with AEs of rhabdomyolysis 
presented with CK elevations, and neither subject had clinical features of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., kidney 
involvement, myoglobinuria). Both subjects had performed strenuous exercise.  
Incidental increases from baseline in mean BP parameters were observed in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA 
group. Only a limited number of subjects had a blood pressure in the hypertensive range.  
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 1.0% (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) vs. 0% (placebo). The two events 
leading to treatment discontinuation were rash and portal hypertension in a subject with a medical 
history of hepatic cirrhosis. 
In Study 103 Safety set, the incidence of subjects with at least one AE was 58.2% in the VX-
445/TEZ/IVA group and 63.5% in the TEZ/IVA group. In general, a similar pattern was in the TEAEs, 
but overall with lower frequencies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 168/169 
 
 
 
The long-term safety data (Study 105 Safety Set, OLS) showed decreased exposure-adjusted event 
rate of (related AEs), Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs with VX-445/TEZ/IVA compared to the Study 102 Safety 
Set. In the Cumulative Safety Set, the safety profile is quite similar to the safety profile of Study 102 
Safety Set.  
In Study 105 Safety Set, 7 (1.4%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, of whom 3 
subjects discontinued due to AEs of transaminase elevation. The other subjects discontinued treatment 
due to AEs of depression, rash, tinnitus and contusion, and hepatic encephalopathy.  
Influenza is included as an ADR in section 4.8. “Susceptibility for influenza virus infections” is classified 
as an important identified risk in the RMP. The applicant committed to continue the monitoring of 
influenza in the post marketing setting to further characterise this ADR and agreed to incorporate 
available data on influenza in the planned PASS.   
The safety profile of subjects in subgroups of F508del-CFTR mutation with F/MF and F/F in the 
cumulative safety set was broadly comparable across the F/MF and F/F subgroups respectively. In 
general, the safety is broadly comparable in subgroups.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In Study 105 IA2, 229 subject patients had an exposure of > 24 ≤ 48 weeks and 271 patients had an 
exposure ≥ 48. More information on long term safety will become available during post-marketing 
pharmacovigilance when final results for study 105 will be submitted.  
VX-445/TEZ/IVA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Only in case of urgent 
and unavoidable need for treatment with Kaftrio and after weighing the benefits and risks of such 
treatment, VX-445/TEZ/IVA may be used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment applying a 
dose reduction. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Rash occurred frequently with VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment. There was an increase in the incidence of 
rash in female subjects taking hormonal therapy compared with those not taking hormonal therapy; 
the increase was larger in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group. Therefore, a role for 
hormonal therapy in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded as mentioned in the SmPC section 4.4.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
According to the Applicant, if a modulator has a large effect on the F508del-CFTR, then the presence of 
a single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a clinical benefit. Based on this new hypothesis and 
the results from studies 102 and 103, a broad indication was initially proposed to include all patients 
with at least one F508del mutation independently of the second allele. This means that efficacy for 
non-tested populations of F/MF, F/RF and F/G should be extrapolated. It should be noted that 
uncertainties remain on the value of the new paradigm proposed, as it is not accepted by CHMP that all 
class 1 MF mutations are equal and that no protein is produced in each and every case. Therefore, it 
cannot be excluded that some of the MF mutants may make a contribution to the CFTR-mediated 
chloride transport upon treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 
ppFEV1 as a surrogate endpoint is a well-established endpoint and a reduction in the decline of FEV1 is 
related to improved survival.  
Pulmonary exacerbations and decline of lung function have an impact on survival in cystic fibrosis and 
reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions of the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of treatment of cystic fibrosis.  
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/MF genotype 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference of 14.3% (p<0.0001) between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo in absolute 
change of ppFEV1 is well above the predefined threshold (5%) and also above the definition of clinical 
relevance in the context of the natural decline in CF patients in the pivotal study 102. Approximately 
80% patients treated with the TC have a benefit of ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 15% in the placebo 
group. The results are considered clinically and significantly relevant.  
The rate ratio of 0.37 for exacerbations comparing VX-445/TEZ/IVA to placebo is relevant. 
Strength of the evidence 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups. The results of the primary parameter are supported by all key secondary parameters. CFQ-
R respiratory domain, BMI and sweat chloride all showed improvements well above the MCID. 
The results were consistent across the subgroups of criterion 1 and criterion 2 mutations and upon 
further subdivision based on genotype or in vitro responsiveness. In this patient populations IVA, 
LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA were not efficacious, which confirms the need for the VX-445 compound. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
Not all known MF mutations can be tested in a clinical trial. The clinical benefit seen in these F/MF 
patients has such a large effect size, that it is unlikely that uncertainties related to MF mutations not 
being tested, the absence of a direct in vitro in vivo comparison, inclusion criteria or chosen dose 
regimen will affect the data to such an extent that the benefit could be questioned.  
1.  CF patients with the F/”MF criterion 1” showed substantial clinical benefit, derived by the F508del 
allele, as MF mutants do not form a protein. 
o  87% of the criterion 1 mutants result in truncation that are likely not to form a functional 
protein. In this subgroup the ppFEV1 improvement is 13.2% (10.4, 16.0) which is consistent 
with the overall study population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 172/173 
 
 
 
 
 
o  It has been discussed and agreed that G542X (n=65 in study 102) and R553X (used in HBE 
cells) do not form a protein. These alleles form half of the nonsense mutations subgroup which 
showed similar clinical benefit as the FAS. In a subgroup analysis for G542X specifically an 
ppFEV1 improvement of 13.6% (9.4, 17.7) was observed. 
2.  CF patients with the F/”MF criterion 2” show substantial clinical benefit, derived by the F508del 
allele. 
o  Clinical results of non-responsive and responsive criterion 2 mutations suggest that effect is 
mediated by the F508del allele. 
3.  Result in different studies, with specific collection of MF mutants, show consistent efficacy results.  
o  Results seen in the different studies in which F/MF CF patients were participating show highly 
consistent efficacy results (within group). 
o  The subgroups in genotypes and FRT responsiveness show highly similar results. 
o  The result is consistent with effect seen in the F/F population. 
Based on the pre-clinical data, the clinical data and the lack of evidence that all MF mutation do not 
form a protein, the F508del-only treatment paradigm has not been adequately substantiated.  
The consistent results in the F/MF population subgroups, together with the magnitude of the efficacy 
observed indicate that extrapolation to untested MF mutations can however be accepted. Additionally, 
it is considered important for the prescriber to mention that not all mutations have been clinically 
tested in studies 102 and provide the list of mutations studied in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the Applicant agreed to expand the efficacy information of VX-445/TEZ/IVA (overall and 
per genotype subgroup) by providing registry data from a PASS. 
CF patients 12 years or older with the F/F genotype 
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference of 10.0% (p<0.0001) between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA in absolute 
change of ppFEV1 is well above the predefined threshold (5%) and also above the definition of clinical 
relevance in the context of the natural decline in CF patients in the pivotal study 103. Approximately 
70% patients treated with the TC have a benefit of ppFEV1 >5%, compared to 13% in the TEZ/IVA 
group. The results are considered highly clinically relevant.  
The results from study 105 confirm the benefit in FEV1 was maintained until 24 weeks. For pulmonary 
exacerbations, the estimated event rate per year was 0.30 in the F/F population of study 105. 
Strength of the evidence 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring VX-445/TEZ/IVA were observed across all prespecified 
subgroups. 
The result of the primary parameter is supported by all key secondary parameters. CFQ-R respiratory 
domain, BMI and sweat chloride all showed improvements well above the MCID. 
Study 103 had a duration of only 4 weeks, but from study 105 it was concluded that all effect seen in 
primary and secondary endpoints at week 4 were maintained through week 24. The effects seen in the 
F/F population are in comparison to the approved TEZ/IVA (Symkevi) regimen, which confirms the 
need for the VX-445 compound. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
The clinical benefit seen in these patients has such a large effect size, that it is unlikely that 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 173/174 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
uncertainties related to for example sensitivity analyses, inclusion criteria or chosen dose regimen will 
affect the data in such an extent that this benefit could be questioned.  
While there are no controlled data after 4 weeks for F/F patients due to the short study treatment 
duration, limited open label extension data from the 107 patients (F/F) that enrolled from parent Study 
103 are provided. For the key parameters such as ppFEV1, Sweat Chloride, CFQ-R as well as rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations the improvements seen at 4 weeks appear to be sustained in all patients, 
and the BMI, BMI z score and weight outcomes seem to continue to improve. Therefore, the limitation 
of the short-controlled 4-week treatment period can be accepted.  
Importantly, from a clinical setting it remains uncertain whether all three compounds are required to 
reach the effects seen in the F/F and F/MF patients, as VX-445 monotherapy and VX-445/IVA were not 
tested in a clinical setting as required according to the EU Guideline for Fixed Dose Combinations 
(EMA/CHMP/158268/2017). However, the in vitro data, the highly relevant clinical benefit seen and the 
fact that the drug is well-tolerated are considered relevant enough to outweigh this uncertainty in the 
F/F and F/MF population. 
CF patients with the 12 years or older F/RF or F/G genotype 
For the F/RF and F/G populations real world data form the US registry were provided, no randomised 
clinical data are available. The ppFEV1 results suggest improvement on top of other CFTR modulators, 
but registry data come with many uncertainties due to bias and missing information.  
The cross-study comparison and responder analysis without the ongoing clinical study 104 data in F/G 
and F/RF mutations do not sufficiently support the added benefit of VX445/TEZ/IVA over approved 
modulator therapies. such F/G and F/RF populations require their own demonstration of clinical efficacy 
and safety by a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the efficacy has been 
demonstrated only in patients with F/F and F/MF mutations where randomized clinical trial data are 
available. 
Study 104 
Study 104 data in F/G and F/RF patients are expected to contribute to the understanding of the 
efficacy in these patient populations where the added benefit of the triple combination over existing 
therapies is not clear at present. The data of study 104 cannot be awaited as any further delay in 
CHMP opinion (awaiting the results of study 104) is not acceptable in the context of patients for which 
there is a positive B/R identified (F/F and F/MF) and absence of treatment available (F/MF). The 
Applicant agreed to  submit results of the clinical data by August 2020 in a variation procedure for 
further assessment. 
Safety 
The safety data base is considered sufficient with the submission of the second interim analysis during 
the assessment of this application.  
VX-445/TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to AEs. The safety profile of the 
combination is similar to the already licenced CFTR modulators and appeared comparable across 
studies. However, there were more adverse events for increased ALT, AST and bilirubin indicative for 
hepatic involvement. Based on a PK study in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, yielding 
increased exposure to VX-445, VX-445/TEZ/IVA is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Therefore, Kaftrio should only be used in case of urgent and unavoidable need for 
treatment and after weighing the benefits and risks of such treatment, VX-445/TEZ/IVA may be used 
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment with a dose reduction. Expected exposure in patients

EMA/385871/2020  
Page 174/175 
 
 
 
 
 
with severe hepatic impairment has not been investigated but is expected to be higher than that in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore, in the absence of further data in this 
patient population, VX-445/TEZ/IVA should not be used in such patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy 
The balance of benefits and risks has to be determined in three separate populations. The patients for 
which preclinical and or clinical data is available (F/F and tested F/MF) and for the broader set of 
patients 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
For CF patients with the F/MF genotype, the placebo-controlled study provided efficacy data that 
demonstrate that VX-445/TEZ/IVA provides a substantial clinical benefit, both in the primary and the 
key secondary endpoints.  
For CF patients with the F/F genotype, the active controlled study provided efficacy data demonstrating 
substantial clinical benefit of VX-445/TEZ/IVA both in the primary and the key secondary endpoints in 
comparison with TEZ/IVA.  
For both populations, the results were considered sufficiently robust and highly clinically relevant.  
This clinically relevant effect, in combination with in vitro data and with fact that VX-445/TEZ/IVA is 
well-tolerated, it is considered acceptable that no clinical data with the VX-445 monotherapy and VX-
445/IVA are presented. 
The absence of direct clinical data with the VX-445 monotherapy and VX-445/IVA was considered 
acceptable given the clinically relevant effect as well as in vitro data and well tolerated safety profile of 
Kaftrio.  
Safety 
The safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA was derived primarily from Study 102, as well as study 103 and 
study 105 (extension study). The extensive clinical experience with CFTR modulator therapies 
(including IVA and TEZ/IVA) indicate that the safety profile is consistent across different genotypes for 
each of the individual CFTR modulator treatments. As such, the safety profile established from Study 
102 in F/MF subjects is considered representative for the entire proposed indication, which is 
supported by the comparable safety profile observed in Study 103 in F/F subjects. Furthermore, 
interim analysis (IA2) of study 105 provided during the assessment provided additional long-term 
safety data.    
Overall, VX-445/TEZ/IVA was well tolerated with low discontinuation rates due to AEs. Most important 
adverse events concerned the adverse events indicative for hepatic involvement (ALT, AST and 
bilirubin). Currently, until more data become available, VX-445/TEZ/IVA may be used in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment applying a dose reduction only in case of urgent and unavoidable need 
for treatment with Kaftrio and after weighing the benefits and risks of such treatment.  Upon request 
by CHMP, the Applicant will provide results of the ongoing study in moderate impairment hepatic 
patients by Q32020 for further assessment. At the same time, the Applicant should re-discuss/refine 
the dose-advice in moderate hepatically impaired patients, taking into account the expected exposure 
of the active M1-TEZ metabolite. This information is important in support of the dose advice in patients 
with hepatic impairment. 
The Clinical Study Report for PASS study will be submitted as Post Approval Measure as Category 3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/385871/2020  
Page 175/176 
 
 
 
 
This study will evaluate the safety outcomes, CF disease progression, frequency and outcome of 
pregnancy, and drug utilisation patterns in CF patients taking ELX/TEZ/IVA in the real-world setting. 
Information on CF disease progression in genotype subgroups should also be generated. 
Indication  
Overall, the data of clinical studies 102, 105 and 103 indicate a large clinical benefit with VX-
445/TEX/IVA in F/F and F/MF patients. Although the evidence for the F508del-only hypothesis is 
considered not definitively conclusive and some uncertainties remain, the highly clinically relevant 
benefit, and the consistency of these effects seen with VX-445/TEZ/IVA in studies/subgroups make the 
extrapolation to all patients with an F/MF genotype acceptable. 
In addition, the Applicant agreed to expand the efficacy information of VX-445/TEZ/IVA (overall and 
per genotype subgroup) by providing data in the post approval setting from a post approval safety 
study as mentioned in the RMP. 
For F/RF and F/G population, the evidence for the F508del-only hypothesis is considered not 
definitively conclusive. The registry data provided for these patients are welcome, but subject to 
limitations and to bias to reliably demonstrate the efficacy and safety of VX445/TEZ/IVA in F/G and 
F/RF patients. In conclusion the CHMP was of the view that the registry data do not obviate the need 
for robust, comparative, clinical data in F/G and F/RF patients from clinical trials.  
Study 104 in F/G and F/RF patients 
The data of study 104 in F/G and F/RF patients will meaningfully contribute to the understanding of the 
efficacy in the F/RF and F/G patient populations. The data of study 104 are required to show clear 
benefit in F/RF and F/G patients before the approval of the broad F508del/any indication requested by 
the Applicant can be considered.  
The Applicant following the Oral explanation requested to delay the approval for at least another 3 
months in order to provide the awaiting provide clinical data (Study 104) in F/G and F/RF in the 
procedure, but this was not agreed by CHMP. Any further delay in CHMP positive opinion is not agreed 
in the context of patients for which there is a positive B/R identified (F/F and F/MF) and in view of the 
high unmet medical need in F/MF patients where no treatment is currently available. The Applicant 
finally agreed to submit results of the clinical data (study 104) separately in a variation procedure as 
soon as possible for further assessment. The type II Variation should be submitted by September 
2020. 
In conclusion, a positive benefit risk is considered demonstrated in the F/MF and F/F populations and 
the applicant agreed to amend the claimed indication to: 
“Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the 
CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation (see section 5.1).” 
Third party intervention during the evaluation of Kaftrio 
The CHMP received, during the assessment of this application, 5 correspondences from 4 Cystic fibrosis 
associations (hereinafter referred to as “third parties”) expressing the third parties’ views about the 
efficacy and safety profile of Kaftrio, the unmet medical need of CF patients and their vulnerability 
during the Covid-19 crisis.    
The CHMP considered those interventions in the context of its assessment and concluded that the 
observations put forward by the 4 CF associations were already known by CHMP, and as such had no 
impact on the CHMP assessment or its conclusions.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kaftrio is positive in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or 
heterozygous for the F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kaftrio is not similar to Kalydeco, Symkevi, Bronchitol, 
and Tobi Podhaler within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Kaftrio is favourable in the following indication: 
Kaftrio is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for the F508del in 
the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
Not applicable 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that 
ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor is a new active substance as elexacaftor is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union and it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any EU authorised active substance. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0091/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

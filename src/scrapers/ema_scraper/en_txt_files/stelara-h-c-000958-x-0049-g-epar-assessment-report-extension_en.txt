1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder, Janssen-Cilag International N.V. (MAH) submitted to the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) on 27 November 2015, an application for a grouping of variations in 
accordance with Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1243/208, consisting of an extension 
of the marketing authorisation and a type II C.1.6.a variation. 
The MAH applied for an extension of the marketing authorisation consisting of a new route of 
administration, additional pharmaceutical form and a new strength 130 mg concentrate for solution for 
infusion intravenously. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
STELARA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response, lost response, were intolerant to conventional therapy 
or a TNFα antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies 
 The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I (point 2 c, d and e) thereof – 
Extension of marketing authorisation

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Patients present with persistent diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The incidence in Europe is about 10 per 100,000. It is understood that the incidence and prevalence 
are rising worldwide. 
Crohn's disease may present at any age though it more commonly presents in young adults. Both 
sexes are affected equally. It is more common in the presence of a family history in first degree 
relatives. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
There are many theories of the underlying pathophysiology of Crohn’s disease. In one such theory, 
intestinal antigen-presenting cells in Crohn's disease secrete IL-12 and IL-23. IL-12 induces immune 
cells toward a T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype (stimulates interferon-gamma [IFN-γ] production) while IL-
23 induces a T helper 17 (Th17) pathway (promotes secretion of IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-22). Both 
cytokines stimulate TNF production, resulting in the intestinal inflammation and epithelial cell injury 
typical of Crohn’s disease. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected from the mouth to the anus, with the ileum, 
colon and perineum most frequently involved. Affected tissue is identified by well-demarcated areas of 
thickened bowel, stenosis, adhesions, local lympho-adenopathy and fistulae. Typical endoscopic 
features include isolated aphthous ulcers, deep ulceration, a cobblestone appearance of the gut lining 
and polyp formation.  
Histologically, Crohn's disease is characterised by trans-mural inflammation of the intestine. 
Inflammation may be non-specific or may be present as focal or diffuse granulomata. Extra-intestinal 
manifestations may affect the skin, joints, liver, biliary tree and eyes. 
Diagnosis is achieved by a combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, endoscopic and histological 
findings. Management of patients is usually done within secondary care settings. The natural history of 
patients is to undergo repeated hospital admissions and multiple operations and to be susceptible to 
under-nutrition and malignancy. Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition that relapses and remits. It has 
a global impact on patients’ education, work, social and family life. 
Despite the availability of many chemical and immunological treatments for Crohn’s disease there 
remains a sub-set of patients who are unresponsive to and/or intolerant of treatments with already 
Assessment report

Page 7/152 
 
  
  
authorised drugs. Because the condition is often persistent over decades, is debilitating and is often a 
major impediment to patients’ quality of life there is a need for additional treatment options. 
2.1.5.  Management 
About the product 
Stelara (ustekinumab, CNTO 1275) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
that binds with high affinity and specificity to the p40 subunit common to both human IL-12 and 
human IL-23 and so neutralises their biological activities. Stelara may have a role in the management 
of Crohn’s disease because IL-12 and IL-23 are involved in the pathophysiology of Crohn’s disease. 
Stelara (ustekinumab, EMEA/H/C/0958) was first authorised in the EU in January 2009 for the 
indication of plaque psoriasis. An extension to the indication was granted in 2013 to add psoriatic 
arthritis and a further extension to the indication was granted in 2015 to add the indication for 
paediatric plaque psoriasis in subjects aged 12yrs and older. The company now claims the indication 
for Crohn’s disease. 
The company has developed an intravenous formulation of Stelara specifically for the indication of 
Crohn’s disease and to accompany the subcutaneous formulation already licensed.  
The indication claimed is: 
“STELARA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response, lost response, were intolerant to conventional therapy 
or a TNFα antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies.” 
Only editorial changes were done to the indication during this procedure. 
The approved indication is: 
“STELARA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a TNFα antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies.” 
With regards to posology it is claimed to administer the product in Crohn’s disease first as a single 
intravenous dose which is followed up by subcutaneous administrations every 8 weeks. Dosing every 
12 weeks after the first subcutaneous dose may be acceptable for patients with a lower inflammatory 
burden. Patients who inadequately respond to 90 mg subcutaneous dosing every 12 weeks may benefit 
from an increase in dosing frequency to every 8 weeks. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit by Week 16. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for Stelara (ustekinumab) seeks an extension to the 
therapeutic indication to add the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
Assessment report

disease who have failed on or been intolerant of anti-TNF therapy; the application also introduces a 
new dosing regimen, a new strength of the product, and a new pharmaceutical form. 
The clinical development programme for ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease consists of: 
• 
• 
• 
one phase I study 
two placebo-controlled phase II studies 
three placebo-controlled phase III studies 
Studies are depicted in the following diagram: 
The company did not seek EMA scientific advice. Relevant CHMP guidance documents are: 
Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, 
CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1, July 2008. 
Points to consider on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the management of Crohn's 
disease, CPMP/EWP/2284/99, Jun 2001. 
The chosen primary end-point of the pivotal trials did not fully comply with current CHMP guidance 
regarding duration of study. However, acknowledging that the clinical development of Stelara in the 
indication of Crohn’s disease was initiated before the final version of the current guideline was 
published the development program can be considered overall compliant with the relevant CHMP 
guidelines.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1 Introduction 
Stelara (ustekinumab, CNTO 1275) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
that binds with high affinity and specificity to the p40 subunit common to both human IL-12 and 
human IL-23 and so neutralises their biological activities. 
The Applicant has developed an intravenous (IV) formulation of Stelara – concentrate for solution for 
infusion, 130 mg - specifically for the indication of Crohn’s disease and to accompany the 
subcutaneous formulation already licensed. It is intended that in the indication of Crohn’s disease. 
2.2.2 Active Substance 
This line extension application did not introduce any change to the active substance. 
2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is composed of 5 mg/mL ustekinumab formulated with a histidine buffer, sucrose, 
EDTA disodium salt dihydrate, L-methionine, polysorbate 80 and water for injections at pH 6. 
The ustekinumab final vialed product for IV administration is supplied as a single-use, sterile solution 
designed to deliver 130 mg of ustekinumab in a 30 mL, Type-1 glass vial. The vials are stoppered with 
coated stoppers and sealed with aluminium flip-off seals. The vials are filled to deliver no less than 26 
mL, the nominal deliverable volume for a 130 mg dose. 
Dilution with 0.9% weight/volume sodium chloride should be performed before administration. If 
necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be stored up to 4 hours at room temperature. 
Satisfactory background information was provided for active substance, excipients, formulation 
development and physiochemical and biological properties.  
The description of excipients is supplemented with risk assessments regarding the use of EDTA and 
methionine in the formulation. Both substances have been used as excipients in other products, and it 
seems that they pose no significant risk in this context. 
The Applicant has set out the principles of the product development studies. The level of polysorbate 
80 was increased in the present formulation to protect the active substance. The studies presented are 
sufficient to demonstrate the protective effect of polysorbate 80 at the concentration chosen. A small 
contribution of polysorbate 80 to the aggregate peak in analysis with Dual wavelength - Size Exclusion 
– High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DW-SE-HPLC) is seen, which has been described in the 
literature and is accepted. Stability studies further underline the protective effect of polysorbate 80. 
During the development of the control strategy for the finished product, the Applicant has employed 
elements of the enhanced approach. Based on the quality target product profile (QTPP) the Applicant 
has assessed key quality attributes for criticality in an iterative process and devised a list of critical 
quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process control (IPCs). 
In relation to IPCs the Applicant has submitted information from various stages of validation with the 
aim of providing a justification for the IPC acceptance criteria and additionally provided the validation 
of the parameters to be used for the bubble point filter integrity test. This is accepted. 
The rationale behind choosing the container closure system and its development is adequately 
described. As part of the compatibility studies, the Applicant conducted a standard leachable and 
extractables study. A dye-ingress study was conducted to support the container integrity, both after 
closure and after shipment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 10/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The compatibility of the finished product with the infusion solution and polymeric containers and tubing 
was sufficiently shown. The data show that the infusion solution is stable for the requested 4 hour in-
use time. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Ustekinumab final vialed product for infusion is manufactured with ustekinumab active substance 
(target 90 mg/mL).  
The manufacturing process consists of shipping, receipt, and storage of the active substance. This is 
followed by thawing of the active substance, pooling and mixing, pre-filtration of the pooled and mixed 
active substance, dilution of the active substance with pre-filtered formulation buffer and mixing to 
produce a homogeneous solution, pre-filtration of the solution, sterile filtration, and aseptic filling into 
vials (30 mL vial). Following aseptic filling, the vials are stoppered and capped. The vials are then 
optically inspected and stored at 2-8 °C until ready for labelling and secondary packaging. After 
labelling and secondary packaging, the vials are then stored at 2-8 °C prior to shipment.  
The Applicant has set out the manufacturers and batch formula sufficiently. The manufacturing process 
is described with sufficient detail and the process parameters are provided in a separate table, 
including proven acceptable ranges. IPCs are also listed. Where appropriate, information on the 
analytical methods and their validation is provided for the IPCs. 
Overall sufficient information is provided on the process validation runs. 
The Applicant has given a very detailed description of the overall statistical approach and enhanced 
sampling plan used in the process validation. The employed acceptable tolerance intervals of 95/99 are 
accepted. The statistical analysis confirmed that the batches were manufactured consistently.  
All batches were produced with maximum permissible hold and processing times, thus validating 
individual and cumulative hold times. Summaries of recent media fills were provided which were in 
compliance. Additionally, the Applicant conducted validation of the glass depyrogenation, equipment 
and component sterilisation and shipping. These validations were satisfactory, any deviations were 
sufficiently explained. 
Manufacturing process development 
For the majority of assays the IV and SC finished product are practically indistinguishable, including 
measurements of particulates. The only significant difference found was in turbidity, which was 
predictably lower for the IV product, and colour, which in light of the lower concentration and different 
formulation is not considered an issue.  
A total of 36 SC finished product batches were used for comparative stability data at 2-8°C and 
compared to 6 IV finished product batches. Trend lines at the different temperatures were generally 
not statistically distinguishable. Turbidity was decreased for the IV finished product.  
Product specification 
The specification and control of excipient is sufficiently described in the dossier. All excipients are 
compendial (Ph. Eur.). 
The attributes tested for in the finished product specification are accepted. The release specification for 
IV finished product includes general attributes, as well as controls for appearance, safety, purity, 
charge distribution, potency, and quantity. 
The applicant has set out the approach to setting specifications and has given justification for each 
individual release criterion.  
The Applicant is recommended to review all release specifications when 30 batches will have been 
produced. 
The Applicant has given a suitable overview of the analytical procedures used and has given 
information about the validation of the relevant analytical procedures and also qualification summaries 
for the sterility and endotoxin compendial methods. The information provided is accepted and does not 
raise further concerns.

Analytical batch data were submitted with the dossier and demonstrate the consistency of the 
manufacturing process for the IV formulation: all results were in compliance and batches were 
consistent. 
Product and process related impurities related to the finished product were characterised.  
Reference standard are the same as those used for the active substance. 
A sufficient description of the container closure system was provided. 
Stability of the product 
The Applicant has provided real time data for 8 batches of finished product (IV). Process validation 
batch data are available up to 9 months, whereas clinical batch data are available up to 24 months (2 
batches). Following clarification regarding the history of the clinical batches, it is considered that the 
clinical batches are sufficiently representative of the commercial process. 
The panel of analytical assays used for the determination of stability is accepted. Data demonstrate 
that within the 24 month period batches stay well within the defined acceptance criteria. The proposed 
shelf life of 24 months (2-8oC) is therefore accepted. 
Stability studies were supplemented with photo-stability and temperature cycling studies, the results of 
which raise no further questions. 
The post-approval stability protocol and commitment are accepted. 
Data support the in-use storage of the diluted infusion solution for up to 4 hours at room temperature. 
Adventitious agents 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE remains sufficiently 
assured. 
2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The control strategy is well presented and clear and the approach to identifying CQAs, CPP, IPCs and 
their respective acceptance criteria is acceptable.  
Comparability data were presented to show that the IV finished product is comparable to the approved 
SC finished product presentation. 
The manufacturing process is well described and from the data provided is under good control. Process 
validation data were presented from 3 batches of the commercial process and show that the process is 
capable of generating a product of consistent quality. 
The Applicant used a statistical approach to setting finished product specifications. The proposed 
specifications are considered acceptable. 
The Applicant provided sufficient stability data to justify the proposed shelf life of 24 months when 
stored at 2-80C. 
2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Stelara concentrate for solution for infusion is considered to be in line with the 
quality of other approved monoclonal antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical 
and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the 
finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is 
controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
The overall Quality of Stelara concentrate for solution for infusion is considered acceptable.

2.2.6 Recommendation for future quality development 
1. The Applicant is recommended to review all release specifications when 30 batches will have been 
produced. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The company is also conducting an extension study to study CRD3003. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab following intravenous and/or subcutaneous administration were 
evaluated in 2 Phase 2 (C0379T07, C0743T26) and 3 Phase 3 (CNTO1275CRD3001 [CRD3001], 
CNTO1275CRD3002 [CRD3002], CNTO1275CRD3003 [CRD3003]) clinical studies in subjects with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 13/152 
 
  
  
 
A Phase I study CNTO1275NAP1002 (NAP1002) where the PK of the 2 different IV formulations of 
ustekinumab were compared in healthy subjects in order to demonstrate PK comparability between the 
IV formulation used in the Phase III Crohn’s disease studies and the to-be-marketed IV formulation 
has also been completed.  
Absorption  
• 
Bioavailability 
After the intravenous induction phase of the proposed treatment of CD using ustekinumab 
bioavailability can be assumed to be 100%. The estimated bioavailability following SC ustekinumab 
administration in patients with Crohn’s disease was about 78%, and the typical elimination half-life was 
estimated to be 19 days. 
• 
Bioequivalence  
The commercial formulation for IV induction in Crohn’s disease is a dilute liquid in vial (LIV) 
formulation (5 mg/mL). A new 5 mg/mL formulation was subsequently developed and both biochemical 
and biophysical comparability was demonstrated. Study NAP1002 was conducted in healthy subjects to 
provide evidence of comparability for the newly developed 5 mg/mL formulation and to bridge to the 
90 mg/mL formulation used in the Phase III studies.  
A total of 140 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 6 mg/kg IV ustekinumab 
infusion of either a 90 mg/mL (n=70) or 5 mg/mL (n=70) formulation. The PK profiles from the 90 
mg/mL formulation used in the Phase III studies and the 5 mg/mL to-be-marketed formulation were 
superimposable. The formulations also demonstrated comparable PK based on the conventional 
bioequivalence criteria. Both formulations were well tolerated in healthy subjects and no significant or 
new safety findings were observed. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is estimated to be 4.62 L which is comparable to the 
volume of the vascular system (5 L in a 70 kg individual), suggesting that ustekinumab is primarily 
distributed within the vascular system. This is consistent with the known distribution of endogenous 
IgG and other therapeutic mAbs. Median volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) 
following a single intravenous administration to patients with psoriasis ranged from 57 to 83 mL/kg. 
Elimination 
Being a complex protein molecule ustekinumab can be assumed to undergo proteolysis and re-
utilisation or urinary excretion of the resultant peptides and amino acids. From population 
pharmacokinetic analysis the typical value for clearance (CL) in a patient with an approximate body 
weight of 70 kg was 0.19 L/day (95% CI: 0.186 to 0.196 L/day). Median systemic clearance (CL) 
following a single intravenous administration to patients with psoriasis ranged from 1.99 to 
2.34 mL/day/kg. Median half-life (t1/2) of ustekinumab was approximately 3 weeks in patients with 
Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis, ranging from 15 to 32 days across all psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis studies. 
The following table was obtained by the population PK analysis:

Clinical Study Report C0743T26: 
After a single IV administration of ustekinumab at doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 6 mg/kg, median 
serum ustekinumab concentrations in all treated subjects were approximately proportional to dose at 
all sampling timepoints through Week 8 (Figure 3).

Median peak serum ustekinumab concentrations, which were observed 1 hour after the end of infusion 
at Week 0, were 24.3 μg/mL, 71.6 μg/mL and 144.1 μg/mL for the 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg induction 
treatment groups, respectively. 
At Week 6, which was the time of the primary efficacy endpoint, median serum ustekinumab 
concentrations were 1.7 μg/mL, 5.4 μg/mL, and 11.6 μg/mL for the 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg induction 
treatment groups, respectively (Table 7).

In CRD3001, median peak serum ustekinumab concentrations 1 hour after the Week 0 infusion were 
43.6 μg/mL and 129.1 μg/mL for the 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg dose groups, respectively:

Study CRD3002: the corresponding peak concentrations were 39.8 μg/mL and 124.4 μg/mL for these 2 
dose groups, respectively. 
•  Time dependency 
Following maintenance treatment with SC ustekinumab every 8 weeks (q8w) or every 12 weeks 
(q12w), steady state was reached at approximately 8 or 12 weeks after subjects began receiving 
ustekinumab 90 mg q8w, or ustekinumab 90 mg q12w maintenance doses, respectively. 
Although median serum ustekinumab concentrations 4 weeks post-dose were only slightly higher 
following the q8w regimen compared to those receiving the q12w regimen, median steady-state trough 
serum ustekinumab concentrations over time in the ustekinumab q8w group (1.97 μg/mL to 2.24 
μg/mL) were 3-fold greater in the ustekinumab q8w group than in the q12w group (0.61 μg/mL to 
0.76 μg/mL). 
Following maintenance doses of ustekinumab 90 mg q8w or q12w, serum ustekinumab concentrations 
were sustained over time through Week 44 in almost all randomized subjects.

• 
Children 
Children with Crohn’s disease have not been studied. The proposed indication specifies adult CD

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug – drug interactions have been performed in human populations. This is a standard situation 
for monoclonal antibodies and is justified on the specificity of the interaction with their ligand and that 
free antibody is rapidly broken down to non-functioning oligo peptide.   
Immunogenicity 
Among 1,154 treated patients with appropriate samples for the assessment of antibodies to 
ustekinumab, 27 (2.3%) were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab. Of the 27 treated patients who 
were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab 17 (63.0%) were positive for neutralising antibodies  
The proportion of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab among those who were 
receiving concomitant immunomodulators was 1.9%, compared with 2.6% of subjects who were not 
receiving immunomodulators.  There was no apparent impact on clinical efficacy following the 
development of antibodies to ustekinumab. However, among those who were in clinical response to 
ustekinumab induction but were randomised to placebo maintenance, the remission rate was 
numerically lower among subjects who developed antibodies to ustekinumab (14.3%; 1 of 7) 
compared with the remission rate among those who were not positive for antibodies (37.1%; 46 of 
124). The development of antibodies to ustekinumab had no apparent impact on injection-site 
reactions; however, the incidence of these events was generally low in the full study population.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of four α-helices, and is involved in the differentiation of 
naive T-cells into Th1 cells, which is important in resistance to pathogens. It is known as a T cell 
stimulating factor, which can stimulate the growth and function of T cells. It stimulates the production 
of  IFN-γ and TNF-α from T and  NK cells. Ustekinumab binds to and neutralises human IL-12.  
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a heterodimeric cytokine with a similar structure to IL-12. One of the subunits  
p40 is shared with IL-12, the other is p19 (the IL-23 alpha subunit). IL-23 promotes up-regulation of 
the matrix metalloprotease MMP9, increases angiogenesis and reduces CD8+ T-cell infiltration. In 
conjunction with IL-6 and TGF-β1, IL-23 stimulates naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate into a novel 
subset of cells called TH17, which are distinct from the classical Th1 and Th2 cells. Th17 cells produce 
IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine that enhances T cell priming and stimulates the production of 
proinflammatory molecules. Ustekinumab binds to and neutralises human IL-23.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Aspects of the pharmacodynamics of ustekinumab were described in the original clinical development 
programme for the indication of psoriasis in 2009. 
With regards to the current application: 
• 
• 
Plasma concentration and effect: among randomized subjects in the ustekinumab groups, 
greater proportions of subjects in the higher serum ustekinumab concentrations quartiles 
achieved efficacy endpoints compared with those in the lower serum ustekinumab 
concentration quartiles.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other described medicinal products were not found up to 
week 44 of exposure. Concomitant use of immunosuppressants or corticosteroids did not 
appear to influence the safety or efficacy of Stelara In Crohn’s disease studies. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of ustekinumab following intravenous (IV) and/or 
subcutaneous (SC) administration were evaluated in 2 Phase II (C0379T07, C0743T26) and 3 Phase III 
(CNTO1275CRD3001 [CRD3001], CNTO1275CRD3002 [CRD3002], CNTO1275CRD3003 [CRD3003]) 
clinical studies in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. A population PK analysis 
and exposure-response analysis with respect to efficacy and safety, using combined data from 
C0743T26, CRD3001, CRD3002 and CRD3003 has been performed. The methodology utilised for 
conducting the population PK analysis was considered appropriate. All parameters were reasonably well 
estimated except the effect of immune response on clearance due to the limited sample size of 
subjects with positive immune response. 
Ustekinumab PK parameters in healthy subjects were obtained from non-compartmental analysis, 
while those for subjects with Crohn’s disease were obtained from the population PK analysis. Standard 
methodology was utilised for non-compartmental analysis. The key parameters of ustekinumab have 
been derived using a standard and acceptable methodology. The volume of distribution was similar 
between healthy subjects and subjects with Crohn’s disease, clearance was lower, and T1/2 was longer 
in this healthy subject study compared with the studies in subjects with Crohn’s disease. From the 
model output and covariate analysis, it is agreed that the parameter values, including covariate effects 
are estimated with good precision and that the model was stable and produced well-estimated 
parameters. In the population PK analysis of data from subjects with Crohn’s disease, the impact of 
concomitant immunomodulators commonly used in Crohn’s disease (including azathioprine, 6-
mercaptoprine, methotrexate [MTX]), and corticosteroids were evaluated. There was no significant 
impact of any of these medications on the PK of ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease which is consistent 
with a previous finding from a population PK analysis of ustekinumab in subjects with psoriatic arthritis 
(PsA), which indicated that the clearance (CL) of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant MTX, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral corticosteroids, or prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNFα) antagonist agents. The use of concomitant immunomodulators with biologics (particularly 
TNFα-antagonists) is generally expected to result in decreased CL or increased elimination half-life, 
and subsequent higher systemic exposure of the biologic.  
Contrary to this expectation, the median terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) in ustekinumab-treated 
healthy subjects (who did not receive these immunomodulators) was numerically higher than those in 
subjects with Crohn’s disease, a signification proportion of whom were receiving immunomodulators 
(24.0 days vs 18.9 days). Thus, it is unlikely that the differences observed in ustekinumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 20/152 
 
  
  
concentrations between healthy subjects and those with Crohn’s disease are attributable to the impact 
of concomitant immunomodulators. 
In the Phase III induction studies, median serum ustekinumab concentrations in patients who received 
induction dosing by weight (6 mg/kg) were about three-fold higher than the concentrations observed 
in patients who received the fixed dose induction (130 mg). Median peak serum ustekinumab 
concentrations 1 hour after the Week 0 infusion were 41.9 μg/mL (mean ± SD: 41.9±12.8) and 126.1 
μg/mL (mean ± SD: 125.2±33.6) for the 130 mg and 6 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean patient 
bodyweight in the studies was approximately 70 kg thus the fixed dose corresponded to approximately 
2 mg/kg.  At the end of induction (Week 8) in both studies, median serum ustekinumab concentrations 
were 2.1 μg/mL and 6.4 μg/mL for the 130 mg and 6 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. 
Following maintenance treatment with ustekinumab 90 mg 8 weekly or 12 weekly in Study CRD3003, 
steady-state was reached by the start of the second dose. Median steady-state trough serum 
concentrations over time in the ustekinumab 8 weekly group (1.97 to 2.24 µg/mL) were 3-fold higher 
than in the 12 weekly group (0.61 to 0.76 µg/mL).  
Population PK analysis indicates that body weight, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, TNF-antagonist 
failure status, gender, race (Asian versus non-Asian), and antibody to ustekinumab status were found 
to explain some of the variability observed in the PK of ustekinumab. The impact of these statistically 
significant covariates on the respective PK parameters was within ±20% when evaluated across a 
representative range of covariate values or categories in the data, which is within the overall variability 
observed in the PK of ustekinumab. 
Based on results from Study C0743T26 it can be accepted that, following a single IV administration of 
ustekinumab ranging from 1 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, median serum ustekinumab concentrations were  
approximately dose proportional and were detectable at all sampling time points through Week 8. 
Based on results submitted by the company for study 3001, it may be accepted that median peak 
serum ustekinumab concentrations 1 hour after the Week 0 infusion were 43.6 μg/mL and 129.1 
μg/mL for the 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Based on results submitted by the 
company for study 3002, it may be accepted that median peak serum ustekinumab concentrations 1 
hour after the Week 0 infusion were 39.8 μg/mL and 124.4 μg/mL for these 2 dose groups, 
respectively. From the clinical perspective, the company has demonstrated dose proportionality and 
also constant exposure over time could be shown. 
The Applicant has proposed a weight-range-based dose of ustekinumab approximating 6 mg/kg (260 
mg [weight ≤ 55 kg], 390 mg [weight >55 kg and 85 kg], or 520 mg [weight >85 kg]) for the 
induction treatment of patients with Crohn’s disease. The Applicant evaluated the predicted 
ustekinumab exposure and the corresponding efficacy outcomes across these 3 bodyweight subgroups. 
Based on the PK data, ustekinumab exposures in subjects with body weight ≤ 55 kg were lower 
compared to those in the other bodyweight subgroups. Absolute efficacy outcomes were also lower in 
this subgroup as compared to the >55 kg to ≤ 85 kg, and >85 kg weight subgroups. When looking 
within the weight subgroups, efficacy outcomes were consistent across ustekinumab exposure quartiles 
in the >55 kg to 85 kg, and >85 kg weight subgroups. Within the ≤ 55 kg bodyweight subgroup, the 
proportion of subjects achieving efficacy outcomes were lower among subjects in the lower 2 
ustekinumab exposure quartiles, while subjects in the top 2 quartiles demonstrated efficacy outcomes 
consistent with those in the other body weight subgroups for clinical remission. These observations 
suggests that approximately half of subjects in the <55 kg stratum may not have achieved optimal 
exposures, ie, the higher exposures associated with higher levels of efficacy. Therefore, it remains 
possible that targeting higher exposures in these subjects could result in greater efficacy. However, 
despite the lower absolute rates of efficacy in the subset of subjects in the lower 2 quartiles of the ≤ 55 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 21/152 
 
  
  
kg bodyweight subgroup, the observed net treatment effects (relative to placebo) in the overall ≤ 55 
kg bodyweight subgroup were generally consistent with those in the other bodyweight subgroups. 
Further analysis also suggests that the baseline disease characteristics of subjects in the lower 2 
quartiles of the ≤ 55 kg bodyweight subgroup (higher CDAI, higher CRP, and lower albumin) may have 
contributed to the lower ustekinumab exposure, and lower absolute efficacy outcomes observed in this 
subset of subjects. 
With regard to the impact of ustekinumab on body weight, this effect can be assessed from the weight 
component of the CDAI score. While the time period to impact weight during induction was limited, 
there does not appear to be an impact on the weight component of the CDAI score. For the 
maintenance study, this effect was assessed from the weight component of the CDAI score for change 
from maintenance baseline. Based on this analysis, there does not appear to be an impact of 
ustekinumab on the weight component, and no difference in body weight changes between the 2 active 
maintenance dose regimens was seen in the change from baseline during maintenance. 
Although a small number of subjects developed antibodies to ustekinumab in the presented clinical 
studies and the effect on clearance is concluded to be small, the Applicant was requested to discuss 
the importance of antibody type e.g. neutralising, on the PK and the impact of immunogenicity against 
ustekinumab. In the corresponding ustekinumab maintenance treatment groups, there were no 
apparent differences in the proportions of subjects who were in clinical remission, or clinical response, 
at Week 44 between subjects who were positive for Nab and those who were negative for NAb. The 
limited number of subjects with detectable ADA does not allow a definitive conclusion on the impact of 
ustekinumab antibodies on the long-term efficacy of ustekinumab. The low incidence of antibodies 
(either neutralizing or nonneutralizing) emphasizes that the presence of ADA is not expected be a 
critical consideration for prescribers and patients in terms of ability to attain long-term efficacy with 
ustekinumab maintenance therapy. 
The exposure-response relationship has shown that nonlinear logistic regression models with additive 
placebo and Emax drug effects on the logit-probability scale adequately described clinical responder 
rates at Week 6 and clinical remission rates at Week 8 and Week 52.  The highest induction dose, 6 
mg/kg IV and the more frequently administered maintenance dose regimen, 90 mg Q8W SC were 
associated with serum ustekinumab concentrations spanning the portion of the exposure response 
curves with the highest clinical response and remission rates.   
No specific studies have been conducted with intravenous ustekinumab in elderly or paediatric patients 
and only 5 subjects over 75yrs age had formal PK analysis and this labelled in the SmPc which is 
acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has provided sufficient data to describe the pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab. The 
pharmacology of ustekinumab in the treatment of Crohn’s Disease is considered to be sufficiently 
characterized.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy

Study C0379T07 was a Multicenter, Randomized, Phase 2a Study of Human Monoclonal Antibody to 
IL-12p40 (CNTO 1275) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn’s Disease. Adult subjects 
with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease or fistulising Crohn’s disease of at least 6 weeks 
duration with a Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) score of ≥ 220 and ≤ 450 could be included. 131 
subjects were randomized among 42 study sites (35 sites in the US, 6 in Canada, and 1 in Belgium).  
Two populations of subjects with Crohn’s disease were studied simultaneously: 
Subjects in Population 1 were those with Crohn’s disease despite treatment with 5-ASA compounds, 
antibiotics, corticosteroids, and/or immune-modulators, including anti-TNF agents. For Population 1, 
the design was blinded to study agent (not route of administration) and placebo-controlled. 104 
subjects were randomized in Population 1, 57 male and 47 female, 90% Caucasian, ages 18-67yrs, 
weight 45.0-164.6Kg. 
Subjects in Population 2 were those who failed to respond to, or lost response to, infliximab at the 
maximum approved dose and treatment regimen for Crohn’s disease as defined in the US package 
insert. 27 subjects were randomized in Population 2, 13 male and 14 female, 85% Caucasian, ages 28-
77yrs and weight 50.5-131.3Kg.  
Intervention:  
In Population 1, subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups 1:1:1:1, as follows: 
[CNTO 1275 is study agent] 
In Population 2, approximately 20 infliximab non-responders (ie, subjects who failed to respond to, or 
lost response to, infliximab at the maximum approved dose and treatment regimen for Crohn’s disease 
as defined in the US package insert) were randomized to receive open-label CNTO 1275, as follows.

•  CNTO 1275 90 mg subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3 
or 
•  CNTO 1275 4.5 mg/kg intravenously at Week 0. 
Subjects in Population 2 were not scheduled to receive placebo, and were not to receive study agent at 
or after Week 8. Baseline demographic characteristics were generally similar across the treatment 
groups. 
Outcome:  
Primary Efficacy Analysis: clinical response at Week 8 for Population 1.  
Clinical response was defined as a reduction in the CDAI score of ≥25% and ≥70 points. 
To determine the final clinical response status for a subject, treatment failure and missing data rules, 
as described, were applied. 
The primary endpoint analysis was based on the comparison between the combined SC and IV Placebo 
and combined SC and IV CNTO 1275 treatment groups in Population 1. This comparison was made 
using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test at an 0.05 level of significance, with route of 
administration as the stratum. 
Results are summarised in the following table: 
The proportion of subjects in clinical response at Week 8 for the SC CNTO 1275 and placebo groups 
was 48.0% vs 50.0%, respectively.  
For the IV groups, a greater proportion of subjects in clinical response was observed at Week 8 in the 
CNTO 1275 group than in the Placebo group (50.0% vs 29.6%, respectively).

The company also reports on clinical response at Week 8 for Population 2 
The proportion of subjects in Population 2 who were in clinical response at Week 8 was 42.9% in the 
SC CNTO 1275 treatment group compared with 53.8% in the IV CNTO 1275 treatment group (Table 
17). These results were similar to those observed for Population 1. 
C0743T26 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study of ustekinumab IV induction followed by 
SC maintenance in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who had previously 
failed TNF antagonist therapy. The study was designed to confirm the Phase 2a study results and 
identify the IV induction dose and SC maintenance dose regimens to be carried into Phase III. 
Patients had a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease of at least three months 
duration with a CDAI score of ≥ 220 and ≤ 450. Patients had received infliximab, adalimumab, or 
certolizumab pegol at a dose approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, and either did not respond 
initially, lost response, or were intolerant to the medication (according to predefined failure criteria).  
At the Week 0 visit, 526 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to a single IV infusion of placebo 
or ustekinumab 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg. A dynamic randomisation procedure using a minimisation algorithm 
with investigative site and initial response to TNF antagonist therapy (yes or no) as the stratification 
variables was used. At Week 6, all patients were evaluated for the primary endpoint of clinical 
response. Patients continued to be followed for induction efficacy to Week 8. 
The study also included a maintenance phase. At Week 8, responders and non-responders to IV 
ustekinumab were separately re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either ustekinumab or placebo. Inclusion 
in the responder or non-responder groups was based on clinical response status at Week 6 (clinical 
response was defined as a reduction from baseline in CDAI of ≥ 100 points or <150 for patients with a 
baseline score ≥ 220 to ≤ 248, also referred to as 100-point response). These patients received 
ustekinumab 90 mg SC or placebo SC at Weeks 8 and 16, and were assessed for efficacy at Week 22. 
Patients who were randomised to placebo induction dosing were not re-randomised at Week 8; those 
in clinical response to IV placebo induction dosing at Week 6 continued to receive placebo SC injections 
Assessment report

at Weeks 8 and 16 and those who were not in clinical response to IV placebo induction dosing at Week 
6 received ustekinumab 270 mg SC at Week 8 and 90 mg SC at Week 16. 
Patients receiving oral corticosteroids at Week 0 who were in clinical response at Week 6 were to have 
their daily dose of corticosteroids tapered by the investigator beginning at Week 8.  
A diagram of the full study design is shown in Figure 1. 
Efficacy Results 
The proportion of patients in clinical response (100-point response) at Week 6 (primary endpoint) was 
significantly greater in the 6 mg/kg group (39.7%) than in the placebo group (23.5%, p=0.005). There 
did not appear to be a dose response relationship between the three ustekinumab groups. 
The effect of ustekinumab on inducing clinical response was generally consistent across subgroups by 
demographics, baseline disease characteristics, concomitant medications at baseline and Crohn’s 
disease-related drug history, and by anti-TNF therapy history (data not shown here).  
In the maintenance phase of the study patients randomised as responders to ustekinumab IV 
induction, and who received ustekinumab SC 90 mg at Weeks 8 and 16, significant benefit was 
observed in clinical remission and clinical response at Week 22 (Table 3 below).

Induction dose 
The induction dose was based on results of the phase 2 studies: 
• 
The SC regimen in study C0379T07 returned results that were not different to placebo and so 
the iv regimens were pursued in the C0743T26 Phase 2b study. 
•  1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 6 mg/kg doses were chosen for study C0743T26 based on modelling 
and indications that a high dose of 6 mg/kg would lead to higher efficacy. 
The following doses were selected for the Phase 3 induction studies: 
•  An ustekinumab 130 mg IV fixed dose was chosen for the low-dose group (~2 mg/kg was 
thought to be sufficient to overcome the observation that 1 mg/kg may have lost effectiveness 
between Weeks 6 and 8) in C0743T26.

• 
The high dose ustekinumab group was based on tiered dosing by weight at multiples of 130 mg 
IV vial approximating 6 mg/kg IV (<55 kg: 260 mg ustekinumab; ˃55 kg to ≤85 kg: 390 mg 
ustekinumab; >85 kg: 520 mg ustekinumab). 
Given that the tiered dosing by weight was at multiples of 130 mg, the 130 mg IV vial would minimize 
the potential for dosing errors and, because this presentation contained the exact dose intended for 
delivery, it would both minimize waste and eliminate the potential for inappropriate use of leftover 
product in these vials intended for single use. 
Maintenance dose 
A SC route of administration was chosen based upon greater convenience and the premise that 
treatment by the SC route would maintain response and remission. 
A maintenance regimen of ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w was selected based on the observation that 
subjects in response in C0379T07 demonstrated a tendency to lose their clinical response when serum 
ustekinumab concentrations decreased below 1 - 2 μg/mL. Based on PK modelling, the 90 mg q8w 
regimen was predicted to provide a steady-state serum trough level of 1.69 μg/mL. Results up to 22 
weeks in study C0743T26 also supported the Q8W dose. 
The ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w regimen was predicted to achieve a steady-state trough 
concentration of about 0.4 μg/mL and had been studied extensively in psoriasis and thought likely to 
also succeed in maintaining response and remission in Crohn's disease. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Studies CRD3001 and CRD3002 were near replicate with the same methodology Stelara common to 
both studies.  The principal difference was the CD population which in the 3001 study were required to 
have failed on or been intolerant of previous anti-TNF therapy while in the 3002 study they may, or 
may not, have received previous anti-TNF therapy but should not have failed on or been intolerant to 
it. Therefore only the results sections of the 3002 study are described below while a full description of 
Study 3001 is given. 
CRD3001:  A Phase III, Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, Multicentre 
Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ustekinumab Induction Therapy in Patients with 
Moderately to Severely Active Crohn’s Disease who have failed or are Intolerant to TNF Antagonist 
Therapy.

At Week 6, all subjects were to be evaluated for the primary endpoint of clinical response.  
At Week 8, subjects who had been randomized to ustekinumab induction therapy at Week 0 and had 
been induced into clinical response at Week 8 in this study were eligible to enter the maintenance 
study, CNTO1275CRD3003, as the primary efficacy population.  
Subjects who were not in clinical response to ustekinumab induction therapy, as well as all subjects 
who initially received placebo (both in clinical response and not in clinical response), were also eligible

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Clinical response at Week 6, defined as a reduction from baseline in the CDAI score of ≥100 points.  
Subjects with a baseline CDAI score of ≥220 to ≤248 points were considered to be in clinical response 
if a CDAI score of <150 was attained.  
Major secondary endpoints 
In order of importance: 
 1) clinical remission at Week 8, defined as a CDAI score <150 points  
 2) clinical response at Week 8 
 3) 70-point response at Week 6, defined as a reduction from baseline in the CDAI score of ≥70 points 
 4) 70-point response at Week 3 
Efficacy evaluations included  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
serum CRP concentrations 
stool samples analyses for fecal lactoferrin and fecal calprotectin markers  
the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey 
Fistula closure (assessed for subjects with fistula disease) and reduction or resolution of lesions 
was to be assessed for subjects with pyoderma gangrenosum.  
•  Mucosal healing was to be assessed by ileo-colonoscopy at participating sites in subjects who 
consented to participate in that sub-study.  
•  Health economics analyses were also to be performed. 
Safety assessment was to be based on reported adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital 
sign measurements, physical examinations, electrocardiogram findings, and tuberculosis testing. 
Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations. 
Sample size 
CRD3001: Assuming a 25% clinical response rate at Week 6 in the placebo group and a 40% rate in 
the ustekinumab high dose group, 205 subjects per treatment group were predicted to yield an overall 
power of 90%, at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). 
The power for detecting a significant difference between the ustekinumab high dose group and placebo 
was also examined for the first major secondary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8. Assuming a 
10% clinical remission rate at Week 8 in the placebo group, and a rate of 20% in the ustekinumab 
high-dose group, 205 subjects per treatment group were predicted to yield an overall power of 81%, 
at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). To increase the power to detect a significant difference for the 
clinical remission endpoint, the sample size for the key efficacy analyses was increased to 225 subjects 
per treatment group (total sample size of 675), which provides 85% power for the clinical remission 
endpoint.

Randomisation 
Subjects were to be allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups using a permuted block randomization with 
study region (Asia, Eastern Europe, or rest of world), CDAI score (≤300 or >300), and initial response 
to TNF antagonist therapy (yes or no) as the stratification variables.  
For subjects who had received multiple TNF antagonist therapies, their initial response status (yes or 
no) was to be determined by whether they initially responded to the first TNF antagonist therapy 
received.  
Allocation to treatment group was performed using a central randomization centre by means of an 
IVRS/IWRS. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blinded. To maintain the study blind, the study agent container was to have a 
multilingual label containing the study name, medication number, and reference number. A tear-off 
label was designed to be separated from the study agent container and attached to the subject's 
source documents; the label was not to identify the study agent in the container. The medication 
number was to be entered in the case report form (CRF) when the study agent was dispensed. Study 
agents were packaged so as to be identical in appearance in order to maintain the study blind. 
Statistical methods 
Handling Missing Data 
The CDAI score was calculated for a visit only if 4 or more of the 8 components were available at that 
visit. When at least 4 of the 8 components were available, any missing components were imputed by 
carrying forward the last non-missing component, with the exception of a missing hematocrit value 
where the value obtained closest to the date of the visit (before or after) was used if it was within 7 
days, otherwise the last observation was carried forward. 
If the CDAI score could not be calculated (i.e., <4 components available) at a visit, the CDAI score was 
considered missing. Subjects with a missing CDAI score at Week 6 were considered to not have 
achieved clinical response at Week 6. 
Analysis Method 
The proportion of subjects in clinical response at week 6 was compared between each of the 
ustekinumab treatment groups and the placebo group using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-
square test, stratified by study region (Asia, Eastern Europe, or rest of world) and baseline CDAI score 
(≤300 or >300) at a significance level of 0.05. Initial response to TNF antagonist therapy (yes or no) 
was an additional stratification factor in CRD3001. 
Control of Type I Error Rate 
A fixed sequence testing procedure was used to control the overall Type 1 error rate at the 0.05 level 
of significance. Specifically, the ustekinumab high dose group (dose approximating 6 mg/kg 
ustekinumab) was first compared with the placebo group at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. If 
the ustekinumab high dose group was significantly different from the placebo group, then the 
ustekinumab low dose group (130 mg ustekinumab) was compared with the placebo group at the 2-
sided 0.05 level of significance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 33/152 
 
  
  
The study was considered to be positive if the ustekinumab high dose group was significantly different 
from the placebo group for the primary endpoint. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
To examine the robustness of the primary endpoint analysis, sensitivity analyses of the primary 
endpoint were conducted using the observed case, last observation carried forward, multiple 
imputation, and the worst case (missing=success on placebo and failure on active) missing data 
methods Treatment failure rules were to override the missing data rules, meaning that if a subject has 
both an event of treatment failure (ie, a Crohn’s disease-related surgery thought to be a result of lack 
of efficacy of study agent or specified changes in concomitant Crohn’s disease medications) before 
Week 6 and has a missing CDAI score at Week 6 (i.e., <4 components of the CDAI available), the 
subject was considered a nonresponder in the sensitivity analysis regardless of whether or not CDAI 
data are present. 
A sensitivity analysis in which subjects who were randomized but never treated were excluded was 
also performed. 
Datasets for Analysis 
Efficacy: Efficacy analyses included subjects randomized at Week 0. Efficacy analyses were to be based 
on an intent-to-treat principle. Therefore, the efficacy data for each subject were analyzed according to 
the assigned treatment, regardless of the actual treatment received. 
Clinical Pharmacology and Safety: Unless otherwise specified, the PK analyses were based on subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of IV ustekinumab, and safety analyses were based on subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of IV study agent. Subjects were analyzed according to the actual treatment 
received. 
Results (study CRD3001) 
Participant flow 
Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single IV administration of placebo 
(n=247) or 1 of 2 induction doses of ustekinumab at Week 0: 130 mg ustekinumab (n=245) or tiered 
ustekinumab doses approximating 6 mg/kg (~6 mg/kg ustekinumab group; n=249), as shown in the 
following diagram:

Recruitment 
Study centres: 178 sites in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Israel, South Africa and 
Brazil. 
Start of study: 23rd June 2011. Completion of study: 3rd July 2013 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol deviations reported were adequately addressed and did not compromise the validity of 
the study nor affected the overall interpretation of the clinical study. Amendments were not considered 
to have affect study validity. 
Baseline data 
Subject baseline demographic characteristics are summarized in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 35/152 
 
  
  
 
Baseline demographic characteristics were similar across the treatment groups.  
4.5% of subjects did not complete the study: 3.1% terminated before Week 8 and 1.3% of subjects 
terminated between Week 8 and the Week 20 safety follow-up visit. The most common reason for 
termination was withdrawal of consent.  
Baseline Disease Characteristics are summarised in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 36/152 
 
  
  
 
 
Disease characteristics were balanced across the 3 treatment groups. Furthermore Medical history and 
current diagnoses as well as concomitant medications were balanced across the treatment groups. 
Among the subset of subjects who had failed corticosteroids, the proportion was slightly higher in the 
~6 mg/kg group (51.0%) compared with the placebo and 130 mg groups (41.5% and 37.8%, 
respectively). This difference was not expected to affect study results. 
The proportions of subjects who had previously received immunomodulators and had failed or become 
intolerant to them were balanced across the treatment groups. 
To enter the study, subjects had to have previously failed at least 1 TNF antagonist (ie infliximab, 
adalimumab, or certolizumab pegol), either by having an inadequate initial response, by having a 
response following by loss of response, or by being intolerant. Subjects could have met more than 1 of 
these criteria.  
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 37/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
TNF antagonist therapy history is summarized in the following tables: 
Among all subjects, 29.1% had an inadequate initial response, 69.4% had response followed by loss of 
response, and 36.4% had intolerance to 1 or more TNF antagonists; 48.0% had failed 1 TNF 
antagonist in the past and approximately half had failed 2 or 3 TNF antagonists (40.8% and 10.4%, 
respectively). 
78.8% of subjects had failed infliximab, 59.8% had failed adalimumab and 22.1% had failed 
certolizumab pegol. The TNF history was balanced across all groups. 
Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted in the primary analysis population. Subjects were 
analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized: 247 subjects to placebo, 
245 to 130mg, 249 to 6mg/kg. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint was clinical response at Week 6, as defined, and as shown in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 38/152 
 
  
  
 
A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab 
groups were in clinical response at Week 6 (33.7% and 34.3%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (21.5%; p=0.003 and p=0.002, respectively). The study met its primary end-point. 
4% (31/741) of randomized subjects had missing data for the CDAI score at Week 6 (5.3%, 5.2%, and 
2.0% of subjects in the placebo, ~6 mg/kg, and 130 mg ustekinumab groups, respectively). Sensitivity 
analyses supported the main analysis. 
Major Secondary Analyses 
Clinical remission at Week 8 was defined as a CDAI score of <150 points. Results are shown in the 
following table: 
The proportion of subjects in remission at Week 8 was numerically greater in the ~6 mg/kg dose group 
than in the 130 mg group. 
Results for clinical response at Week 8 are shown in the following table:

A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab 
groups were in 70-point response at Week 3 (40.6% and 38.4%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (27.1%; p=0.001 and p=0.009, respectively). 
The endpoint of 70-point response at Week 6 was defined as a reduction from baseline in the CDAI 
score of ≥70 points at Week 6. A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the ~6 mg/kg 
ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab groups were in 70-point response at Week 6 (43.8% and 
46.1%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (30.4%; p=0.002 and p<0.001, respectively).

Of the 628 randomized subjects, baseline demographics were balanced across the treatment groups, 
as shown in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 45/152 
 
  
  
 
Baseline disease characteristics were balanced across the 3 groups, as shown in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 46/152 
 
  
  
 
The median Crohn’s disease duration was slightly higher in the placebo group at baseline (8.28 years) 
compared with the ustekinumab groups (5.61 years and 6.21 years in 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg group, 
respectively). 
Relevant Medical History is summarised in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 47/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Overall, medical history and current diagnoses were balanced across the treatment groups as well as 
the proportion of subjects receiving each class of Crohn’s disease medication at baseline was similar 
across the 3 treatment groups. 
96.3% of subjects had previously received corticosteroids with approximately 81% of subjects having 
previously failed, become intolerant of, or been dependent on, corticosteroids. 
Approximately 75% of subjects had been treated with a full and adequate course of 
immunomodulators in the past, and approximately 68% of subjects had either failed or become 
intolerant to immunomodulators. 
Subjects in the study were allowed to have previously received TNF antagonists, but they were not to 
have demonstrated inadequate response or intolerance to them. The subjects included those who were 
naive to TNF antagonists. 
Numbers analysed 
Per protocol, all subjects were to receive 1 dose of study agent at Week 0.  
Subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized: 209 
subjects to placebo, 209 to 130mg, 209 to 6mg/kg. 
Efficacy analyses were based on an intent-to-treat principle. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint was clinical response at Week 6, defined as a reduction from baseline in the 
CDAI score of ≥100 points. Subjects with a baseline CDAI score of ≥220 to ≥248 points were 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 48/152 
 
  
  
 
 
considered to be in clinical response if a CDAI score of <150 was attained. Results are shown in the 
following table: 
2.6% (n=16) of randomized subjects had a missing CDAI score at Week 6 (8 [3.8%], 3 [1.4%], and 5 
[2.4%] of subjects in the placebo, ~6 mg/kg, and 130 mg ustekinumab groups, respectively. 
Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Major Secondary Analyses 
Clinical remission at Week 8 was defined as a CDAI score of <150 points. Results are summarised in 
the following table: 
A significantly greater proportion of subjects in both the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg and ustekinumab 130 
mg groups were in clinical remission at Week 8 (40.2% and 30.6%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (19.6%; p<0.001 and p=0.009, respectively. 
Clinical Response at Week 8 is summarised in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 49/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
A significantly greater proportion of subjects in both the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg and ustekinumab 130 
mg groups were in clinical response at Week 8 (57.9% and 47.4%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (32.1%; p<0.001 for both). 
A significantly greater proportion of subjects in both the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg and ustekinumab 130 
mg groups were in 70-point response at Week 3 (50.7% and 49.3%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (31.6%; p<0.001 for both). 
The endpoint of 70-point response at Week 6 was defined as a reduction from baseline in the CDAI 
score of ≥70 points at Week 6. A significantly greater proportion of subjects in both the ustekinumab 
~6 mg/kg and ustekinumab 130 mg groups were in 70-point response at Week 6 (64.6% and 58.9%, 
respectively) compared with the placebo group (38.8%; p<0.001 for both).

CRD3003: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group, Multicenter Study 
to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ustekinumab Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately 
to Severely Active Crohn’s Disease 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Primary Population 
The primary population for the key efficacy analyses is those subjects in clinical response to IV 
ustekinumab induction therapy (at Week 8 of the induction studies, CNTO1275CRD3001 and 
CNTO1275CRD3002).  
Other Subject Populations Entering This Study 
•  Subjects in clinical response to IV placebo (at Week 8 of the induction studies, 
CNTO1275CRD3001 and CNTO1275CRD3002) 
•  Subjects not in clinical response to IV ustekinumab (at Week 8 of the induction studies, 
CNTO1275CRD3001 and CNTO1275CRD3002) 
•  Subjects not in clinical response to IV placebo (at Week 8 of the induction studies, 
CNTO1275CRD3001 and CNTO1275CRD3002) 
Flow of subjects is summarised in the following diagram: 
Subjects who were not in the primary population were to be followed for both efficacy and safety and 
received additional study agent as described below, but were not be included in the key efficacy 
analyses.

Treatments 
Primary Population: 
Subjects in Clinical Response to Ustekinumab Induction Dosing 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at Week 0 of this maintenance study to receive 1 of the 
following SC regimens. 
•  Group 1: Placebo 
•  Group 2: Ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w (with final dose at Week 36) 
•  Group 3: Ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w (with final dose at Week 40) 
Other Subject Populations 
Subjects in the other populations will not be randomized, but rather will be assigned treatment as 
follows: 
•  Subjects in Clinical Response to Placebo Induction Dosing 
Subjects will continue to receive SC placebo throughout the maintenance study. 
•  Subjects Not in Clinical Response to Ustekinumab Induction Dosing 
Subjects will receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC at Week 0. If these subjects have achieved clinical 
response at Week 8, they will continue to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w through Week 
40. 
If, by Week 8, these subjects have not achieved clinical response, they will be discontinued 
from further study agent administrations and will return for a final safety visit at Week 20 (ie, 
20 weeks after the last administration of study agent). 
•  Subjects Not in Clinical Response to Placebo Induction Dosing 
Subjects will receive ustekinumab 130 mg via IV administration at Week 0. If these subjects 
have achieved clinical response at Week 8, they will initiate subcutaneous ustekinumab 90 mg 
SC at Week 8 and then q12w thereafter through Week 32. 
If, by Week 8, these subjects have not achieved clinical response, they will be discontinued 
from further study agent administrations and will return for a final safety visit at Week 20 (ie, 
20 weeks after the last administration of study agent). 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 55/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Treatment groups are depicted in the following figure: 
Dosage and Administration 
All subjects were to receive an SC administration of study agent (either placebo or ustekinumab) every 
4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 40 with the exception of Week 4.  
Placebo administrations (both IV and SC) were given at dosing visits in which an active administration 
was not planned in order to maintain the blind, particularly with respect to SC regimen dosing interval 
(eg, a subject in the 90 mg ustekinumab q12w treatment group was to receive SC placebo at visits 
occurring 4 weeks and 8 weeks after receiving 90 mg ustekinumab). 
All placebo IV induction subjects not in clinical response to induction dosing were to also receive an IV 
administration of ustekinumab at Week 0.  
All ustekinumab IV induction non-responders received a placebo IV administration at Week 0 to 
maintain the induction study blind.  
For subjects receiving an IV administration at Week 0, the study agent was to be administered over a 
period of not less than 1 hour. The infusion was to be completed within 5 hours of preparation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 56/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The maintenance portion of the study continues to Week 44 (and the subsequent study extension will 
continue up to Week 272). The overall study design is shown in Figure 1: 
Oral Corticosteroids Tapering 
Subjects receiving corticosteroids at Week 0 who are in clinical response should initiate corticosteroid 
tapering at Week 0. This tapering is mandatory and should follow the below recommended schedule. 
Other subjects may also undergo tapering at the discretion of the investigator, and are encouraged to 
do so if demonstrating a clinical response at Week 4 or beyond. 
If subjects experience a worsening in their disease activity while tapering corticosteroids, further dose 
decreases may be suspended, and/or their oral corticosteroid dose may be temporarily increased if 
deemed necessary by the investigator. The oral corticosteroid dose, however, may not be increased 
above the baseline dose unless due to medical necessity. For subjects whose corticosteroid taper is 
interrupted on this basis, investigators are encouraged to resume tapering within 4 weeks. Tapering 
may exceed this schedule only if warranted by medical necessity (eg, subject experiencing 
corticosteroid-related side effects). 
Recommended tapering schedule for oral corticosteroids (other than budesonide) 
•  Dose > 15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: taper daily dose by 5 mg/week until receiving 10 
mg/day, then continue tapering at 2.5 mg/week until 0 mg/day. 
•  Dose 11 to 15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: taper daily dose to 10 mg/day for 1 week, 
then continue at 2.5 mg/week until 0 mg/day. 
•  Dose ≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent: taper daily dose by 2.5 mg/week until 0 mg/day. 
Recommended tapering schedule for oral budesonide 
Subjects receiving budesonide should have their daily dose tapered by 3 mg every 3 weeks until 0 
mg/day.

Dose Adjustment on Loss of Response (in clinical responders to induction) 
Loss of response is defined as a CDAI score ≥ 220 points AND a ≥ 100 point increase from the Week 0 
CDAI score (ie, Week 8 in induction study CNTO1275CRD3001 or CNTO1275CRD3002). 
Subjects in the primary population induced into clinical response with ustekinumab in 
CNTO1275CRD3001 or CNTO1275CRD3002 who subsequently lose response at any scheduled visit will 
be eligible, beginning at Week 8, to receive ustekinumab dosing as follows: 
•  Group 1 (Placebo): Subjects will adjust to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w 
•  Group 2 (90 mg q12w): Subjects will adjust to receive ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w 
•  Group 3 (90 mg q8w): Subjects will continue on ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w 
Dose adjustment is depicted in the following figure: 
Subjects are only eligible for a single dose adjustment (the first time loss of response criteria is met). 
Subjects who have dose adjusted will be assessed 16 weeks after the visit where the loss of response 
criteria was met to determine if benefit was achieved from the dose adjustment. 
Subjects who have not shown improvement in their Crohn’s disease activity at that time (as assessed 
by the investigator) will be discontinued from study agent administration, and should return for a final 
safety visit approximately 20 weeks after the last study agent administration.  
Subjects assessed by the investigator to be clinically improved will continue to receive the same 
adjusted dose, q8w in a blinded manner.  
In order to allow sufficient time to assess benefit after dose adjustment, the Week 32 visit will be the 
final visit when loss of response criteria (and subsequent dose adjustment) can occur.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
•  Clinical remission at Week 44 (defined as a CDAI score of < 150 points) 
Major secondary endpoints in order of importance were: 
1. Clinical response at Week 44. 
2. Clinical remission at Week 44 among subjects in clinical remission to ustekinumab at Week 
0. 
3. Corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44. 
4. Clinical remission at Week 44 in the subset of subjects who were refractory or intolerant to 
TNF-antagonist therapy (ie, subjects from induction study CNTO1275CRD3001). 
Clinical response was defined as a reduction from Week 0 of induction study CNTO1275CRD3001 or 
CNTO1275CRD3002 in the CDAI score of ≥100 points. Subjects with a CDAI score of ≥220 to ≤248 
points at Week 0 of induction study CNTO1275CRD3001 or CNTO1275CRD3002 were considered to be 
in clinical response if a CDAI score of <150 is attained. 
Efficacy was also evaluated by means of: 
• 
Inflammatory Markers 
  C-reactive Protein 
  Fecal Lactoferrin and Calprotectin 
• 
Patient-Reported Outcomes 
  Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire 
  36-Item Short-form Health Survey 
•  Clinical assessment of: 
  Fistulas 
  Pyoderma Gangrenosum

  Mucosal Healing – by endoscopy at selected centres with video assessed at a central 
facility 
Clinical safety was evaluated based on adverse events / clinical laboratory test results / physical 
examination / ECGs, as described. 
Subjects also completed: the Work Limitations Questionnaire, a Productivity Visual Analog Scale and 
Time Lost from Work 
Sample size 
Assuming a 15% clinical remission rate at Week 44 in the placebo group and 35% in the 90 mg q8w 
ustekinumab group, 100 subjects per treatment group were predicted to yield power above 90%, at a 
significance level of 0.05 (2-sided). 
The number of subjects enrolled in this study was dependent on the number of subjects entering from 
the induction studies, CRD3001 and CRD3002. The number of subjects in the primary analysis 
population was dependent on the number of subjects in clinical response to ustekinumab in the 
induction studies who consented to participate in the maintenance study. Assuming clinical response 
rates of 35% and 40% in the 2 ustekinumab dose groups in the CRD3001 study, and clinical response 
rates of 45% and 50% in the CRD3002 study, and an assumption of 10% drop out rate, approximately 
322 responders (approximately 107 per treatment group) were predicted to enter into the 
maintenance study. Note that this calculation excludes the subjects who were randomized in the 
induction studies prior to them being placed on hold by the Sponsor in November 2011. 
Randomisation 
Primary Population 
Subjects who were in clinical response to ustekinumab induction in either study CRD3001 or CRD3002 
were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w, and 
ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w) based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before 
the study under the supervision of the Sponsor. Permuted block randomization with stratification 
factors of clinical remission at Week 0 (yes or no) and ustekinumab induction dose (130 mg or tiered 
dosing approximating 6 mg/kg ustekinumab) were used. 
Other Subject Populations 
Subjects in the other populations were not randomized (they were assigned treatments, as described). 
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain the study blind, the study agent container was to have a multilingual label containing the 
study name, medication number, and reference number. A tear-off label was designed to be separated 
from the study agent container and attached to the subject's source documents; the label was not to 
identify the study agent in the container. The medication number was to be entered in the case report 
form (CRF) when the study agent was dispensed. Study agents were packaged so as to be identical in 
appearance in order to maintain the study blind. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 60/152 
 
  
  
 
The Sponsor was blinded to treatment assignment until after the Week 44 database lock occurred. 
Treatment assignment blinding was maintained for investigative sites, site monitors and subjects 
participating in the study until the Week 44 analyses were completed. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: Efficacy analyses were based on the primary analysis population (ie, subjects in 
clinical response to ustekinumab at Week 8 from 1 of the induction studies CNTO1275CRD3001 and 
CNTO1275CRD3002 excluding the subjects who were randomized prior to study restart). All subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of ustekinumab either in this study or in one of the induction studies, 
were included in the PK analyses. The safety analyses included all subjects who received study agent 
at Week 0.  
The proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44 was compared between each of the 
ustekinumab treatment groups and the placebo group using a 2-sided Cochran Mantel Haenszel chi-
square test, stratified by clinical remission status at Week 0 (yes or no), ustekinumab induction dose 
(130 mg or tiered dosing approximating ustekinumab 6 mg/kg), and the induction study 
(CNTO1275CRD3001 or CNTO1275CRD3002) at a significance level of 0.05. The study was considered 
positive if the 90 mg q8w ustekinumab group was significantly different from placebo.  
The major secondary endpoints were compared between each of the ustekinumab treatment groups 
and the placebo group using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi square test, stratified by clinical 
remission status at Week 0 (yes or no), ustekinumab induction dose (130 mg or tiered dosing 
approximating ustekinumab 6 mg/kg), and the induction study (CNTO1275CRD3001 or 
CNTO1275CRD3002) at a significance level of 0.05.  
Global multiple testing procedures were prespecified to control the overall Type 1 error rate at the 0.05 
level over the primary and major secondary endpoints in this study. All statistical testing was 
performed at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. Nominal p-values are presented.  
Safety analyses were assessed by summarizing the frequency and type of AEs and changes from 
baseline in clinical laboratory parameters for hematology and chemistry analyses. Safety summaries 
are provided for randomized subjects (ie, the primary population) to provide a balanced comparison 
across treatment groups, and for all treated subjects, including both randomized and nonrandomized 
subjects, to provide overall safety across the placebo and ustekinumab groups.

A total of 397 patients were randomised in the study: 133 in the placebo group, 132 in the 
ustekinumab 90 mg 12 weekly group, and 132 in the ustekinumab 90 mg 8 weekly group. Of the 
randomised population 56.4% were female, 84.9% were Caucasian, the median age was 36.0 years 
and median weight 69.0 kg. Baseline demographic characteristics were generally similar across the 
treatment groups (Table 10).  
The proportions of randomised patients who discontinued study agent were similar across treatment 
groups (23.3%, 22.0%, and 22.7% in the placebo,  ustekinumab 12 weekly, and ustekinumab 8 
weekly groups, respectively). The most common reasons for discontinuation were lack of efficacy or an 
adverse event. Among randomised patients, 9.8%, 6.8%, and 10.6% in the placebo, ustekinumab 12 
weekly and ustekinumab 8 weekly groups, respectively, terminated study participation prior to Week 
44. The most common reason for termination was withdrawal of consent. 
Baseline disease characteristics were representative of a population of patients with moderate to 
severe Crohn’s disease that was refractory to available therapies and were generally well balanced 
across the 3 treatment groups: median duration of disease at baseline, 7.57 years; median CDAI 
score, 311.0; median CRP concentration, 9.27 mg/L. 
Of the randomised patients in this study, 44.8% were TNF antagonist refractory, 15.6% had received 
TNF antagonists and had not demonstrated failure or intolerance, and 39.5% had not received any TNF 
antagonist therapy prior to study participation. Additionally, 79.3% of patients were receiving 1 or 
more concomitant medications for Crohn’s disease at baseline, and the proportions of patients 
receiving each class of Crohn’s disease medication at baseline were similar across the 3 treatment 
groups. A total of 181 patients (45.6%) were receiving corticosteroids (including budesonide); 143 
(36.0%) patients were receiving immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or 
methotrexate).

Non-randomised Patients: 
A total of 884 patients were enrolled but not randomised: 123 placebo induction responders, 285 
placebo induction non-responders, and 476 ustekinumab induction non-responders. Baseline 
demographic characteristics were generally similar to those noted for randomised patients.

A total of 455 (51.5%) non-randomised patients discontinued study agent. The most common reason 
for discontinuation of study agent was lack of efficacy.  
Numbers analysed 
Primary population: Efficacy analyses were based on the primary population. This included all 
randomised subjects. Subjects were only randomised if they were in clinical response to ustekinumab 
at Week 8 from one of the induction studies CRD3001 and CRD3002. Efficacy analyses were based on 
an intent-to-treat principle, i.e. the efficacy data for each subject was analysed according to the 
assigned treatment regardless of the actual treatment received. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 44.  
The proportions of subjects in the primary analysis population in clinical remission at Week 44 were 
48.8% and 53.1% in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w groups, respectively compared with 
35.9% of subjects in the placebo group (Table 5): 
The comparison between each of the 2 ustekinumab groups and the placebo group was statistically 
significant (p=0.040 and p=0.005 for the q12w and q8w groups, respectively, versus placebo). This 
study was considered to be a positive study because the ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group was 
significantly different from the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 65/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The proportion of subjects in the primary analysis population who met treatment failure criteria prior to 
Week 44 was greater in the placebo group (45.0%) compared with the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and 
q8w groups (36.4% and 28.9%, respectively): 
The most common reason for meeting treatment failure criteria was loss of clinical response (38.9%, 
22.5%, and 21.9% in the placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w groups, respectively). 
The proportion of subjects with missing data for the CDAI score at Week 44 (ie <4 of the 8 CDAI 
components available) was approximately 5% overall and the proportions across the 3 dose groups 
were 6.1%, 1.6%, and 7.8% in the placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w dose groups, 
respectively. 
Major Secondary Analyses 
The major secondary efficacy analyses were evaluated using the primary analysis population. 
Clinical Response at Week 44 
The proportions of randomized subjects in clinical response at Week 44 were greater in the 
ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w dose groups (58.1% and 59.4%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo group (44.3%; Table 6): 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 66/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The comparisons between both ustekinumab groups and placebo were significant (p=0.033 and 
p=0.018 for the q12w and q8w groups, respectively). 
Clinical Remission at Week 44 among Subjects in Clinical Remission to Ustekinumab at Week 0 
Approximately 60% of the subjects in the primary analysis population were in clinical remission at 
Week 0 of this maintenance study. Among those subjects, the proportions of subjects who maintained 
clinical remission (ie, were in clinical remission at both Week 0 and Week 44) was numerically greater 
in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w dose group and significantly greater in the ustekinumab q8w group 
(56.4% and 66.7%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (45.6%; p = 0.189 and p = 0.007 
for the q12w and q8w groups, respectively, versus placebo; Table 7): 
Corticosteroid-free Remission at Week 44 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 67/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission and not receiving concomitant corticosteroids at Week 
44 were 42.6% and 46.9% in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w dose groups, respectively, 
compared with 29.8% in the placebo group (p=0.035 and p=0.004 for the ustekinumab q12w and q8w 
groups, respectively, versus placebo; Table 8).  
While the nominal p-values for the comparisons of each of the ustekinumab groups with placebo were 
<0.05 for this endpoint, only the ustekinumab q8w regimen can be considered as significantly different 
from placebo within the global multiple testing procedure.  
Clinical Remission at Week 44 in the Subset of Subjects Who Were Refractory or Intolerant to TNF 
Antagonist Therapy 
Among subjects who were randomized in this maintenance study and refractory or intolerant to TNF 
antagonist therapy (ie, were ustekinumab responders at Week 8 of the induction study CRD3001), 
remission rates at Week 44 were numerically greater (38.6% and 41.1%) in the ustekinumab 90 mg 
q12w and q8w dose groups, respectively, compared with the placebo group (26.2%), though these 
differences were not statistically significant (Table 9): 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 68/152 
 
  
  
 
 
While the treatment effects were similar to those in the overall population, there was not sufficient 
power to detect a significant difference from placebo as only 44.8% of the subjects in the primary 
population of this study were in this subpopulation. 
Clinical Efficacy over Time 
The proportions of randomized subjects in clinical remission through Week 44 are presented in Figure 
8: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 69/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission over time were generally similar for the ustekinumab 
90 mg q12w and q8w groups, though remission rates were smallest for the ustekinumab q12w dose 
group at trough serum ustekinumab concentration visits (ie, Weeks 12, 24, and 36), and remission 
rates were generally more consistent for the ustekinumab q8w groups with the exception of Week 16.  
The proportion of subjects in the placebo group who were in clinical remission decreased over time, 
with separation from the ustekinumab groups observed by Week 20. 
When considering remission over time exclusively in the subset of responding subjects that were in 
remission upon entry to CRD3003 (ie remission in remitters), there was a decline over time to 66.7% 
at Week 44 in the q8w group (with a lower proportion of 56.4% on q12w). This decline was gradual 
and even slowed over time, and likely, the early loss of remission was impacted by mandatory steroid 
tapering. 
In contrast, among the induction responders subsequently randomized to SC placebo, the rate of loss 
of response was more pronounced and these subjects continue to lose response at a greater rate than 
either SC dose. The one notable trend was that, as predicted by the half-life of ustekinumab, former 
recipients of the ~6 mg/kg dose tended to maintain efficacy until 16-20 weeks later (Weeks 8 to 12 of 
maintenance study), whereas loss of efficacy began to be apparent by the first maintenance visit at 
Week 4 in those having received the 130 mg dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 70/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The proportions of subjects in clinical response at each visit through Week 44 are presented in the 
following figure: 
The proportions of subjects in clinical response in the ustekinumab groups were comparable and 
decrease from Week 0 of this study through Week 28 and plateau at approximately 60% through Week 
44. The proportions of subjects in the placebo group in clinical response decreased over time with 
separation from the ustekinumab groups clearly observed by Week 20, and the greatest separation 
from treatment groups occurring after Week 28 and continuing through Week 44. 
The median CDAI scores were generally consistent across the placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg q12w, and 
q8w groups at Week 0 of this maintenance study (135.0, 134.0, and 127.0, respectively). At visits 
from Week 4 to Week 44, median CDAI scores were maintained over time for subjects in the 
ustekinumab groups while scores increased over time for subjects in the placebo group, notably after 
Week 16, with clear separation from the ustekinumab groups by Week 20, as shown in the following 
figure:

Clinical Efficacy With Dose Adjustment in Study CRD3003 
Subjects who achieved clinical response with ustekinumab at Week 8 in CRD3001 or CRD3002 (ie, the 
primary population) and who subsequently had a loss of response (LOR) at a scheduled visit between 
Week 8 and Week 32 of this maintenance study were eligible for dose adjustment. 
Eligible subjects randomized to ustekinumab q12w had a dose adjustment to a q8w regimen while 
subjects randomized to ustekinumab q8w meeting LOR criteria remained on the q8w regimen.  
Subjects in the placebo group meeting LOR criteria had a dose adjustment to ustekinumab 90 mg q8w.  
Subjects who had a dose adjustment were assessed 16 weeks after the visit where the loss of 
response criteria was met to determine if benefit was achieved from the dose adjustment.  
The cumulative proportions of subjects meeting LOR criteria by treatment group are shown in Figure 
12: 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 72/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The proportions of subjects who met loss of response criteria in the placebo group increased over time 
to 38.9% at Week 32.  
The cumulative proportions of subjects in the q8w and q12w groups who met loss of response criteria 
were similar over time, increasing through Week 24 and then remaining stable through Week 32 (the 
last allowable time for dose adjustment). 
Clinical Efficacy in Subjects Who had a Dose Adjustment 
LOR with dose adjustment (ustekinumab 90 mg q12w→ustekinumab 90 mg q8w): 
29 subjects in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w group had a dose adjustment to 90 mg q8w after meeting 
LOR criteria. When assessed 16 weeks after dose adjustment: 
  41.4% of these subjects were in clinical remission. 
  55.2% of these subjects had regained clinical response. 
  The median change in CDAI score from time of dose adjustment was -141.0. 
LOR without dose adjustment (ustekinumab 90 mg q8w→ustekinumab 90 mg q8w): 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 73/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
28 subjects in the ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group met LOR criteria for dose adjustment but continued 
to receive ustekinumab 90 mg q8w (per protocol). When assessed 16 weeks after meeting LOR criteria 
for dose adjustment: 
  32.1% of these subjects were in clinical remission. 
  46.4% of these subjects had regained clinical response. 
  The median change in CDAI score from time of dose adjustment was -78.5. 
Dose Adjustment as a Treatment Strategy 
Having observed benefit within the group of subjects who had a dose adjustment from ustekinumab 
q12w to q8w, the data were alternatively evaluated through post-hoc analyses as a treatment 
strategy, an analytic approach that preserves the initial randomization.  
Efficacy in Subjects Resuming Ustekinumab after Treatment Interruption 
As part of the primary analysis population, subjects who were in response and were randomized to 
placebo were treated with ustekinumab 90 mg q8w upon meeting LOR criteria. 
Resumption of ustekinumab treatment (placebo→ustekinumab 90 mg q8w): 51 subjects randomized to 
placebo had a dose adjustment to ustekinumab 90 mg q8w after meeting LOR criteria. At assessments 
16 weeks after initiation of maintenance therapy: 
  39.2% of these subjects were in clinical remission. 
  70.6% of these subjects had regained clinical response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 74/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The median change in CDAI score from time of dose adjustment was -121.0. 
These data indicate that in the subset of subjects who responded to the ustekinumab IV induction dose 
but delayed initiation of the SC maintenance therapy, benefit can be regained without the need for an 
additional IV induction dose. However, it should be noted that the number of subjects in this group 
was limited (51 subjects total) and the majority of patients (32 of 51 [63%]) had a dose adjustment 
within the first 16 weeks of the maintenance study. 
Subjects randomized to placebo who initiated ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w upon loss of response had 
higher rates of remission and response compared to the subjects in the placebo group in the pre-
specified analysis. 
Exposure to corticosteroids 
The median average daily prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose (excluding budesonide) at baseline 
was comparable between the ustekinumab dose groups (20.0 mg/day) and lower in the placebo groups 
(15.0 mg/day). 
Subjects receiving corticosteroids at Week 0 of the maintenance study who were in clinical response 
were to initiate mandatory corticosteroid tapering at Week 0.

EMA/87810/2017 
Page 75/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The major secondary endpoint of corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44 in CRD3003 was achieved 
by a greater proportion of subjects in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w groups (42.6% and 
46.9%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (29.8%). While the nominal p-values for the 
comparisons of each of the ustekinumab groups with placebo were <0.05 for this endpoint, only the 
ustekinumab 90 mg q8w regimen can be considered as significantly different from placebo (p=0.004) 
within the global testing procedure. 
To confirm that results for steroid-free remission were reproducible, as well as reflected sufficient time 
as to be clinically meaningful steroid-free periods, the steroid-free remission analysis was also 
performed with the additional requirement of no steroid use for a minimum of 30 and also 90 days 
prior to the Week 44 primary maintenance endpoint. 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44 who were not receiving concomitant 
corticosteroids for at least 30 or 90 days prior to Week 44 were similar. The proportions of subjects in 
the placebo group that were in remission and off steroids for 30 and 90 days (29.8% and 29%, 
respectively) were lower than in the 90 mg q12w (42.6% and 41.1%, respectively) as well as lower 
than the 90 mg q8w group (46.9% and 45.3%, respectively; p<0.05 for all comparisons vs placebo).  
Consistent results were observed for steroid-free response, complimenting steroid-free remission at 
Week 44. The proportions of subjects in clinical response at Week 44 and not receiving corticosteroids 
were significantly greater in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w groups (51.2% and 50.8%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 76/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group (36.6%; p=0.024 and p=0.026 for the 
q12w and q8w comparisons, respectively. 
Among the subgroup of subjects who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline (approximately 46%), 
a significantly greater proportion of these subjects in the combined ustekinumab group were able to 
discontinue corticosteroids and achieve clinical remission or clinical response at Week 44 (30.2% and 
33.6%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (15.5% and 19.0%, respectively; p<0.05 for 
both vs placebo).  
Though not independently statistically significant due to the smaller number of subjects in the 
subgroup on steroids at baseline, a higher proportion of subjects in both the 90 mg q12w and q8w 
groups achieved steroid-free remission and response at Week 44 compared with the placebo group. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
In general, efficacy results for subgroups examining the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 
44 were consistent with those of the overall study population. A single subgroup, weight at 
maintenance baseline >1st and ≤2nd quartile had an OR<1 in the ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group 
compared with placebo. This was also observed for the q8w treatment group when using weight at 
induction baseline (OR=0.6, 95% CI: 0.2, 1.9). 
Three ustekinumab 90 mg q12w treatment subgroups had an OR<1 compared with placebo. The first 
was the subgroup with weight at maintenance baseline >1st quartile and ≤2nd quartile (OR=0.6, 95% 
CI: 0.2, 1.8), and the second was the subgroup with maintenance baseline CDAI <75 (OR=0.6, 95% 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 77/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
CI: 0.2, 2.3). The ustekinumab 90 mg q12w subgroup with CRP concentrations ≤3 mg/L at induction 
baseline also had an OR<1 (OR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.3, 2.8). 
When evaluated by Crohn’s disease-related concomitant medication and prior CD medication 
subgroups at baseline of an induction study, the treatment effects of ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and 
q8w versus placebo were generally consistent with those of the primary analysis population with the 
exception of receiving both oral corticosteroids and 6-MP/AZA/MTX which had an OR<1 for both 
treatment groups compared with placebo (OR=0.5, 95% CI: 0.1, 2.9) for q12w group and OR=0.9, 
95% CI: 0.2, 4.1) for q8w group. 
Selected sub-groups within study CRD3003 
Subjects entering the maintenance study CRD3003 from the induction study CRD3001 were required 
to have had documented failure with at least 1 TNF antagonist (ie, infliximab, adalimumab, or 
certolizumab pegol), either by having an inadequate initial response, by having a response followed by 
loss of response, or by being intolerant. Of the 397 randomized subjects in this study, 44.8% entered 
from CRD3001 and were TNF antagonist refractory. 
Subjects entering the maintenance study CRD3003 from induction study CRD3002 were allowed to 
have previously received TNF antagonists, but they were not to have demonstrated inadequate 
response or intolerance to them. Of the 397 randomized subjects in this study, 55.2% entered from 
study CRD3002, 15.6% had received TNF antagonists and had not demonstrated failure or intolerance 
and 39.5% had not received any TNF antagonist therapy prior to study participation. 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission through Week 44 by induction study are presented in 
the following table:

At Week 44, the proportions of subjects in clinical remission were numerically greater for both 
ustekinumab treatment groups compared with placebo regardless of induction study and reached 
statistical significance for the ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group (p=0.020) in study CRD3002.  
The proportions of subjects from study CRD3002 who were in clinical remission were greater than the 
proportions of subjects from study CRD3001 who were in clinical remission at all visits through Week 
44. 
For subjects from study CRD3002 who were TNF antagonist therapy naïve (n=156 subjects), the 
proportions of subjects in clinical remission at Week 44 were numerically greater in the ustekinumab 
90 mg q12w group (56.6%) and significantly greater in the ustekinumab q8w group (65.4%) 
compared with the placebo group (49.0%; p=0.512 and p=0.041 for the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w 
and q8w groups, respectively, as shown in the following table:

A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the q12w and q8w groups were in sustained clinical 
remission (ie remission at Weeks 36, 40, and 44; 40.3% and 46.1%, respectively) compared with 
placebo (26.0%; p=0.023 and p<0.001, respectively).

experience, these studies recruited similar subject populations and the studies were identical in design. 
The results across CRD3001 and CRD3002 were generally consistent in terms of the onset of efficacy 
and efficacy over time through Week 8. 
C-reactive protein 
Blood samples were taken to assay for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. CRP was assayed using a 
validated, high-sensitivity CRP assay.  
Greater median reductions from baseline in CRP concentration were observed at Weeks 3, 6, and 8 in 
both ustekinumab dose groups compared with placebo in both induction studies, as shown in figure 
below:

Fecal Calprotectin 
Assays for fecal content of calprotectin were performed using a validated method. 
In both induction studies, at Week 6, there was a significantly greater reduction in fecal calprotectin 
concentration in both the ~6 mg/kg and 130 mg ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo 
group:

Study 3003: 
At baseline, median fecal calprotectin concentrations were 493.48 μg/g, 191.06 μg/g, and 262.06 μg/g 
for the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w, q8w and placebo groups, respectively. At Weeks 24 and 44, the 
median change from baseline in fecal calprotectin was smaller in each ustekinumab group compared 
with the placebo group. At Week 44, the median change was 0.00 mg/kg for each ustekinumab 
groups, compared with the placebo group (153.85 μg/g, p=0.002 and p<0.001 for the q12w and q8w 
groups, respectively. Results are displayed in the following table: 
Pyoderma Gangrenosum Assessment 
All subjects were to be assessed for pyoderma gangrenosum. For subjects with pyoderma 
gangrenosum, the total number of lesions, size of primary lesion, and resolution were to be assessed. 
Two subjects in the primary analysis population of this study had pyoderma gangrenosum. One subject 
in the placebo SC group and 1 subject in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w group both experienced 
resolution of the primary lesion and reduction in the number of lesions. 
Fistula Assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 93/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
All subjects were to be assessed for fistulas. For subjects with fistulizing disease, fistula closure was to 
be assessed. A fistula response was defined as a ≥50% reduction in the number of draining fistulas.  
Enterocutaneous fistulas (eg perianal and abdominal) were to be considered no longer draining (ie 
closed) when there was an absence of drainage despite gentle compression.  
Recto-vaginal fistulas were to be considered closed based on either physical examination or absence of 
relevant symptoms (eg passage of rectal material or flatus from the vagina).  
'Fistula response' was not significantly different in the placebo and study drug groups over the 8 week 
induction studies. 
Fistula response through Week 44 is summarized in the following table:  
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 94/152 
 
  
  
 
One or more clinically apparent fistulas were present at induction baseline in 8.8% of subjects in the 
primary analysis population.  
At Week 0 of this study, after having received ustekinumab induction, 23.1% (n=3/13) and 42.9% 
(n=9/21) in the placebo and combined ustekinumab groups, respectively were in fistula response.  
The proportions of subjects who achieved fistula response were numerically greater in the combined 
ustekinumab compared with the placebo group at all timepoints.  
At Week 44, 80.0% (n=12/15) of subjects in the combined ustekinumab groups had a fistula response 
compared with 45.5% (n=5/11) in the placebo group. 
Health-related quality of life 
Health-related quality of life was assessed by IBDQ and SF-36 questionnaires. At week 8, patients 
receiving ustekinumab showed statistically significantly greater and clinically meaningful improvements 
on IBDQ total score and SF-36 Mental Component Summary Score in both UNITI-1 and UNITI-2, and 
SF-36 Physical Component Summary Score in UNITI-2, when compared to placebo. These 
improvements were generally better maintained in ustekinumab-treated patients in the IM-UNITI study 
through week 44 when compared to placebo. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ustekinumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Crohn’s Disease. No separate 
studies have been carried out in special populations the SmPC includes relevant statements in this 
regard for the prescriber – this is acceptable.  Use in patients with hepatic impairment and with renal 
impairment is ‘missing information’ in the RMP 
Assessment report

Overall, 66/1998 subjects were ≥65 years of age, with 5/1998 subjects being 75 to 84 years of age. 
No subjects in these studies were ≥85 years of age.  
Supportive study 
Subjects from participating sites within the Phase 3 development program could consent to participate 
in the endoscopy substudy and undergo endoscopic assessments at screening (induction baseline), at 
the end of the induction study (Week 8 of induction), and at the end of the maintenance study (Week 
44 of maintenance).  
334 of 1409 subjects in the induction studies were enrolled in this sub-study, including 142 subjects in 
CRD3001 and 192 subjects in CRD3002. 
Baseline characteristics of subjects in the endoscopy sub-study induction population were similar to 
those of the overall induction study population in term so of baseline demographic / disease / Crohn’s 
medication characteristics as well as for baseline endoscopy findings. 
Two measures were used for the evaluation of endoscopic healing of the mucosa:  
• 
• 
changes in the Simplified Endoscopic Disease Severity Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD) 
score and detection of presence/absence of mucosal ulceration.  
biopsies were collected to support exploratory histologic evaluation. 
Mucosal Healing was defined as the complete absence of any mucosal ulcerations among subjects who 
presented with ulceration in at least 1 ileo-colonic segment at induction baseline. 
Endoscopic Response was defined as a reduction of ≥50% from induction baseline in SES-CD score.  
Endoscopic Remission was defined as a total SES-CD score of ≤2.  
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in Simplified Endoscopic Disease Severity Score for 
Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD), a composite score across 5 ileo-colonic segments of presence/size of 
Assessment report

ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface covered by ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface affected by any 
other lesions and presence/type of narrowing/strictures.  
At week 8, after a single intravenous induction dose, the change in SES-CD score was greater in the 
ustekinumab group (n = 155, mean change = -2.8) than in the placebo group (n = 97, mean change 
= -0.7, p=0.012). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of all 3 phase III clinical studies is considered adequate, the patient population is 
adequately selected and the comparator (placebo) is appropriate. The different arms of each study 
were balanced at baseline with regards to subject demographics, disease characteristics, relevant 
medical history and prior therapies and concomitant medications; this is acceptable. 
For studies CRD3001 and CRD3002, the primary end-point was clinical response at 6 weeks after 
administration of Stelara. Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of 
Crohn's disease, CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1, July 2008 advises a primary end-point of: 
The proportion of patients achieving remission within the period of about four to eight 
weeks, based on the pharmacodynamic properties of the test drug 
And that  
Active treatment should continue for at least eight weeks or for at least 2 cycles of 
therapy depending on which is the longer. 
The chosen primary end-point does not comply with current CHMP guidance regarding duration of 
study. In order to comply with CHMP guidance, it would have been preferred if the company had 
chosen a primary end-point of clinical remission at 16 weeks (2 cycles of therapy). Yet it is 
acknowledged that the clinical development of Stelara in the indication of Crohn’s disease was initiated 
before the final version of the current guideline was published given these circumstances the chosen 
endpoint is considered acceptable. 
Secondary end-points were: clinical remission at Week 8, clinical response at Week 8, 70-point 
response at Week 6 and 70-point response at Week 3. It would have been preferred for clinical 
remission at week 8 to be the primary end-point (using a week 8 end-time). It is acknowledged that 
the 70-point reductions in CDAI scores reflect advice from Points to consider on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products for the management of Crohn’s disease, CPMP/EWP/2284/99, June 2001 
(superseded by Rev 1, July 2008). The company also assayed laboratory measurements of 
inflammation (serum CRP concentration and fecal content of calprotectin), the IBDQ and SF-36 
questionnaires were conducted, an endoscopy sub-study was done, fistula response was assessed; 
these measurements are advised in Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the 
treatment of Crohn's disease, CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1, July 2008 and are acceptable. 
For study CRD3003, the primary end-point was clinical remission at Week 44 where clinical remission 
is defined as a CDAI score of <150 points.  
Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Crohn's disease, 
CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1, July 2008 advises a primary end-point of: 
the proportion of patients in whom steroid-free remission is maintained without 
surgery throughout at least 12 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 97/152 
 
  
  
Although the chosen primary end-point differs from that recommended by the CHMP, it is 
acknowledged that the company had chosen to develop Stelara for a population that had not achieved 
a successful outcome with currently available therapies and for whom options were therefore 
restricted. In this context, a primary end-point of clinical remission is considered to be clinically 
important. 
The primary end-point was assessed at 44 weeks. CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1 advises: 
The treatment period should be aimed at a minimum of 12 months. A follow-up period 
of 3 months after treatment discontinuation should be included in the trial. 
The chosen primary end-point does not fully comply with current CHMP guidance regarding duration of 
study. Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that the company is conducting a 228 week extension study of 
CRD3003 with the objective to evaluate primarily the long-term safety of ustekinumab as described in 
the RMP which is considered acceptable. 
Secondary end-points were: clinical response at Week 44, clinical remission at Week 44 among 
subjects in clinical remission to ustekinumab at Week 0, corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44, 
clinical remission at Week 44 in the subset of subjects who were refractory or intolerant to TNF-
antagonist therapy (ie subjects from induction study CRD3001). 
Steroid-free remission analysis was also performed with the additional requirement of no steroid use 
for a minimum of 30 and also 90 days prior to the Week 44 primary maintenance endpoint; this is 
acceptable and is considered to be more informative than a point measurement at week 44. 
The company assayed laboratory measurements of inflammation (serum CRP concentration and faecal 
content of calprotectin), the IBDQ and SF-36 questionnaires were conducted, an endoscopy sub-study 
was done. These measurements are consistent with requirement in the guideline CPMP/EWP/2284/99 
Rev. 1. 
Clinical assessment of fistula drainage was a secondary end-point, as advised in the guideline 
CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There were 741 subjects randomised in study CRD3001.  
For the primary endpoint of clinical response at Week 6, a higher proportion of subjects in the ~6 
mg/kg ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab groups were in clinical response at Week 6 (33.7% and 
34.3%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (21.5%; p=0.003 and p=0.002, respectively). 
The study met its primary end-point.  
For the secondary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8, a higher proportion of subjects in the ~6 
mg/kg ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab groups were in clinical remission at Week 8 (20.9% and 
15.9%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (7.3%; p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively). 
Clinical remission and response were evident from week 3 onwards. 
Other secondary end-point results and sensitivity analyses were supportive towards the primary end-
point.  
There were 627 subjects randomised in study CRD3002. 
For the primary endpoint of clinical response at Week 6, a higher proportion of subjects in the ~6 
mg/kg ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab groups were in clinical response at Week 6 (55.5% and 
51.7%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (28.7%; both p<0.001). The study met its 
primary end-point. 
For the secondary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 8, a higher proportion of subjects in the ~6 
mg/kg ustekinumab and 130 mg ustekinumab groups were in clinical remission at Week 8 (40.2% and 
30.6%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (19.6%; p<0.001 and p=0.009, respectively). 
Clinical remission and response were evident from week 3 onwards. Other secondary end-point results 
and sensitivity analyses were supportive towards the primary end-point.  
While both the 130 mg and the ~6 mg/kg dose provided rapid, meaningful clinical benefit across a 
range of endpoints in the broad Crohn’s disease population, the totality of the evidence across clinical 
outcomes, suggested that the ~6 mg/kg dose performed better than the 130 mg dose. These 
differences were most notable in clinical remission at Week 8,especially since the 130 mg group 
started to lose response between Weeks 6 and 8 while the ~6 mg/kg dose was stable or continued to 
improve. Although these differences were most apparent in the population that had failed conventional 
therapy, they were also observed in the TNF-antagonist refractory population with more severe 
disease. Differences in efficacy between the doses were supported by exposure-response analyses 
showing that the ~6 mg/kg dose shifted more patients into exposure thresholds associated with higher 
response rates. Importantly, the ~6 mg/kg dose did not have notable safety differences compared with 
the lower dose over 8 weeks in pooled analyses. 
397 subjects went forward to be randomised in study CRD3003. 
For the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 44, a higher proportion of subjects in the 90mg 
ustekinumab QW8 and 90mg ustekinumab QW12 groups were in clinical remission at Week 44 (53.1% 
and 48.8%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (35.9%; p=0.005 and p=0.040, 
respectively). The study met its primary end-point.  
For the secondary endpoint of clinical response at Week 44, a higher proportion of subjects in the 
90mg ustekinumab QW8 and 90mg ustekinumab QW12 groups were in clinical response at Week 44

(59.4% and 58.1%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (44.3%; p=0.018 and p=0.033, 
respectively). 
Subjects receiving corticosteroids at Week 0 of the maintenance study who were in clinical response 
underwent reduction of corticosteroid intake from Week 0. 
The major secondary endpoint of corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44 in CRD3003 was achieved 
by a greater proportion of subjects in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w groups (42.6% and 
46.9%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (29.8%). While the nominal p-values for the 
comparisons of each of the ustekinumab groups with placebo were <0.05 for this endpoint, only the 
ustekinumab 90 mg q8w regimen can be considered as significantly different from placebo (p=0.004) 
within the global testing procedure. Nevertheless, ancillary analyses of steroid intake are generally 
supportive towards Stelara exposure permitting reduction in steroid intake. The proportions of subjects 
in the placebo group that were in remission and off steroids for 30 and 90 days (29.8% and 29%, 
respectively) were lower than in the 90 mg q12w (42.6% and 41.1%, respectively) as well as lower 
than the 90 mg q8w group (46.9% and 45.3%, respectively; p<0.05 for all comparisons vs placebo). 
Other secondary end-point results and sensitivity analyses were supportive towards the primary end-
point.  
Taken together the efficacy results for those who received Stelara q8W and q12W in study CRD3003 
both were superior to placebo; 
In study CRD3003, the increase in absolute rate of clinical remission at week 44 for q8w administration 
versus q12w was 4.3% (rate ratio 1.09) and the increase in absolute rate of clinical response at week 
44 for q8w administration versus q12w was 1.3% (rate ratio 1.02).In contrast, there was more 
evidence of ‘related’ adverse events with q8W dosing versus q12W dosing. The CHMP considered that 
the increased rate of adverse events associated with q8W dosing counterbalances the increased 
efficacy such that the q8W and q12W bring equivalent risk/benefit balances. Therefor the s.c. standard 
dose was amended to dosing every 12 weeks (with potential increase to q8w in case if inadequate 
response. However, as the company provided evidence that 31 subjects [median CDAI = 340, i.e. 
‘high burden of disease] experienced loss of response before their second maintenance dose arguing 
that waiting to receive a second subcutaneous dose at week 12 was too long for these subjects who 
were placed on a Q8W dosage. When assessed 16 weeks later (after 2 Q8W ustekinumab 
administrations), the company states that 15/31 were back in clinical response, suggesting that Q8W 
maintenance dosing was a preferable regimen for 15/31 of these patients. Although this analysis of the 
company is observational, it is noted that the company carried out a re-analysis of data on subjects 
who had lost response as part of the original submission; when analysed as a treatment strategy (that 
preserved initial randomisation), similar rates of clinical response and remission were confirmed 
between subjects initiating q12w dosing but being allowed to switch to q8w dosing frequency, and 
those patients who received q8w dosing from the start. 
In the context of a disease such as Crohn’s disease, the CHMP agrees that to offer patients who have 
inadequate response at an early stage of exposure a posology of 8QW is acceptable. 
Results indicated further that subjects receiving an ustekinumab 90 mg q12w dose regimen who have 
experienced a decrease in their response during maintenance, may benefit from an increase in dosing 
frequency to 90 mg q8w, and that taking the approach of initiating subjects on 90 mg q12w with 
adjustment to q8w when needed by LOR ultimately results in similar clinical outcomes to simply 
starting all subjects on 90 mg q8w. This supports further the rationale to have the ability to increase 
the maintenance dose frequency from q12w to q8w upon loss of response in subjects who would begin 
maintenance therapy with a q12w regimen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017

 As 50% of the ustekinumab induction non-responders attained response after an additional 
ustekinumab 90 mg SC dose, there is a demonstrated benefit of receiving an additional dose 8 weeks 
after induction. Further, a substantial number of these subjects maintained response and were in 
remission at Week 44, indicating benefit from continued maintenance therapy with ustekinumab in 
delayed responders. The SmPC outlines that consideration should be given to discontinuation of the 
treatment in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit by week 16 or 16 weeks after 
switching to the 8-weekly dose. 
At visits from Week 4 to Week 44, median CDAI scores were maintained over time for subjects in the 
ustekinumab groups while scores increased over time for subjects in the placebo group, notably after 
Week 16. 
There was a decline in the proportions of subjects in clinical response during the maintenance phase. 
The proportions of subjects in clinical response in the ustekinumab groups were comparable and 
decrease from Week 0 of this study through Week 28 and plateau at approximately 60% through Week 
44. The proportions of subjects in the placebo group in clinical response decreased over time with 
separation from the ustekinumab groups clearly observed by Week 20, and the greatest separation 
from treatment groups occurring after Week 28 and continuing through Week 44. 
As a post hoc exercise, durable clinical remission was defined by the company as requiring subjects to 
be in remission at 80% of visits prior to Week 44 and also at Week 44 (i.e. at least 9 of 11 visits in the 
CRD3003 study). This analysis was performed in subjects who were in clinical response at baseline in 
study CRD3003. Results are shown in the following table: 
A statistically significant result was reached for the ustekinumab q8w dose regimen, and while 
statistical significance was not met for the ustekinumab q12w dose regimen, a generally similar effect 
size was seen as in the primary analysis. Results are consistent with the primary endpoint of study 
CRD3003.However as the analysis of ‘durable clinical remission’ was presented by the company as a 
post hoc exercise the CHMP did not agree to include this information in the SmPC. The Applicant will

further examine the proportion of subjects in remission over the course of the long-term extension 
(from Week 44 onwards) as outlined in the RMP and submit the study results for assessment as soon 
as available. 
A post hoc analysis of study CRD3003 supports a conclusion that there are advantages by switching 
from Q12W maintenance therapy to Q8W maintenance therapy where there has been loss of response. 
Data are also submitted that suggest that, for subjects who responded to the ustekinumab IV induction 
dose but delayed initiation of the SC maintenance therapy, benefit can be regained without the need 
for an additional IV induction dose [the company acknowledges that there were only 51 subjects in this 
group and that most had a dose adjustment within the first 16 weeks of the maintenance study i.e. 
data are limited].  
142 subjects in CRD3001 and 192 subjects in CRD3002 were enrolled in an endoscopy sub-study. The 
baseline characteristics of subjects in the endoscopy sub-study induction and maintenance study 
populations were similar to those of the overall induction and maintenance study populations. 
Endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was evaluated in 252 patients with eligible baseline endoscopic 
disease activity in the sub-study. At week 8, after a single intravenous induction dose, the primary 
endpoint of change from baseline in Simplified Endoscopic Disease Severity Score for Crohn’s Disease 
(SES-CD), a composite score across 5 ileo-colonic segments of presence/size of ulcers, proportion of 
mucosal surface covered by ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface affected by any other lesions and 
presence/type of narrowing/strictures. The change in SES-CD score was greater in the ustekinumab 
group (n = 155, mean change = -2.8) than in the placebo group (n = 97, mean change = -0.7, 
p=0.012). 
95 subjects went forward for endoscopy in study CRD3003. A statistically significant difference in SES-
CD score between study drug and placebo groups was not found at week 44. The high fall-out of 
subjects over the maintenance study and consequent potential for selection bias makes it difficult to 
interpret results from the maintenance phase. Histological analysis of mucosal biopsies did not 
convince of an effect of Stelara. 
In a subgroup of patients with draining fistulas at baseline (8.8%; n = 26), 12/15 (80%) of 
ustekinumab-treated patients achieved a fistula response over 44 weeks (defined as ≥  50% reduction 
from baseline in the number of fistulae draining upon gentle compression) compared to 5/11 (45.5%) 
exposed to placebo. 
For those exposed to Stelara, both serum CRP concentration and fecal content of calprotectin fell over 
the first 8 weeks of induction compared to placebo, presumably reflecting a reduction in inflammatory 
burden for those who received Stelara. Thereafter in the maintenance phase, both serum CRP 
concentration and fecal content of calprotectin were relatively stable over the course of 44 weeks in 
those who received Stelara. Further post hoc subgroup analyses indicated that patients with lower 
inflammatory burden (e.g. CRP ≤10mg/mL) may also benefit from a every 12 week dosing. However 
as this subgroup analysis was not pre-specified (lack ability to control type I errors and to lack 
adequate power) the CHMP considered this an exploratory finding only. 
 For those exposed to Stelara, both the IBDQ and SF-36 scores rose over the first 8 weeks of induction 
compared to results for the placebo group. Scores were relatively constant thereafter in the Stelara 
group over the course of the 44 week maintenance phase. Further, the results of the work limitations 
questionnaire, time lost from work questionnaire and the productivity visual analogue scale did not 
convince of difference between the Stelara and placebo groups over the course of the maintenance 
phase.

Results submitted by the company in 3 technical reports for serum protein and biopsy transcriptome 
analyses are considered exploratory and hypothesis generating and to be not of a standard required 
for inclusion in the PI texts. 
There is lack of information on exposure to the paediatric population and pregnant women; this is 
reflected in the proposed SmPC which is acceptable. The company also clarified that the numbers of 
elderly who were exposed to Stelara were low. Overall, 66/1998 subjects were ≥65 years of age, with 
5/1998 subjects being 75 to 84 years of age. No subjects in these studies were ≥85 years of age. No 
overall differences in efficacy or safety in patients age 65 and older who received STELARA were 
observed compared to younger patients and during use to date in the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
indications, no safety concern relating to use in the elderly has been included in the RMP.  It is 
therefore considered by the CHMP that statements in the SmPC to raise to the prescriber that the 
number of patients aged 65 and older is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently 
from younger patients are appropriate. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The primary end-point of clinical remission over extended exposure to Stelara for 44 weeks in the 
maintenance study was met for both q8W and q12w regimens. This is considered to be clinically 
important for subjects with Crohn’s disease and who have been unable to take anti-TNF or immune-
modulator medicinal products.  
Results of secondary end-points support the primary end-point. In particular, exposure to Stelara was 
associated with decreased exposure to oral steroids. This is also considered to be clinically important 
for subjects with Crohn’s disease because of the significant adverse event profile associated with 
steroids. 
Taken together the efficacy results for those who received Stelara q8W and q12W in study CRD3003 
both were superior to placebo. In study CRD3003, the increase in absolute rate of clinical remission at 
week 44 for q8w administration versus q12w was 4.3% (rate ratio 1.09) and the increase in absolute 
rate of clinical response at week 44 for q8w administration versus q12w was 1.3% (rate ratio 1.02). 
The CHMP considered the increased efficacy with q8W dosing as counterbalanced by more evidence of 
‘related’ adverse events with q8W dosing versus q12W dosing. The company’s proposal to initiate 
dosing every 8 weeks in patients with high burden of disease (CRP >10mg/L and / or CDAI ≥350) was 
not accepted by the CHMP as supportive data were based on post hoc subgroup analyses. Therefor the 
s.c. standard dose (after the first s.c. dose applied 8 weeks after the intravenous dose) was amended 
to dosing every 12 weeks (with potential increase to q8w in case of inadequate response). To avoid 
early loss of response, patients who have not shown adequate response at 8 weeks after the first 
subcutaneous dose may receive a second subcutaneous dose at this time. 
It can be concluded that Stelara brings clinical efficacy to those subjects with Crohn’s disease who 
have failed to respond or who are intolerant towards anti-TNF or conventional therapy.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Crohn’s disease 
The clinical development program for ustekinumab in Crohn’s disease consists of the following studies: 
•  One Phase 2a proof-of-concept study (C0379T07). 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 103/152 
 
  
  
•  One Phase 2b dose-ranging study (C0743T26). 
• 
Two Phase 3 induction studies (CNTO1275CRD3001 and CNTO1275CRD3002). 
•  One Phase 3 randomized withdrawal maintenance study (CNTO1275CRD3003). 
The safety database from the 5 Crohn’s disease clinical studies comprises 1749 ustekinumab-treated 
subjects (a total of 1106 subject years of follow-up) and includes 849 subjects exposed for at least 6 
months, and 464 subjects exposed for at least 1 year. Of these 1749 subjects: 
•  1664 subjects received a single IV induction dose of ustekinumab at Week 0 (601 received ~6 
mg/kg; 754 received 130 mg; and 309 received other doses). 
•  1205 subjects received ustekinumab 90 mg SC maintenance dosing (every 8 or 12 weeks).

Pooled indications (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease) 
Through 1 year of follow-up across all pooled indications (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s 
disease), 5,884 subjects were treated with ustekinumab with 4,521 subject-years of follow-up.  
Of these subjects, 3,503 received a 90 mg SC dose of ustekinumab either q8w or q12w (1,205 
subjects in the combined Crohn’s disease studies, 1801 subjects in the combined psoriasis studies, and 
497 subjects in the combined PsA studies. 
Through 5 years across all pooled indications (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease), 5,884 
subjects were treated with ustekinumab (1,749 subjects in the combined Crohn’s disease studies, 
3,117 subjects [533 on 90 mg SC q8w] in the combined psoriasis studies, and 1,018 in the combined 
psoriatic arthritis studies) with a total of 10,954 subject years of follow-up. 
Data are summarised in the following table: 
Adverse events 
Pooled Data from Phase 3 Studies 
The average duration of follow-up and average exposure was similar for subjects in the placebo, 
ustekinumab 130 mg IV, and ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV groups, during the placebo-controlled period 
(0-8 weeks) in the combined Phase 3 induction studies (CRD3001 and CRD3002).

The overall proportions of subjects with AEs were comparable between treatment groups with no 
evidence of a dose effect (60.5% in the placebo group, 58.4% in the ustekinumab 130 mg IV group, 
and 60.4% in the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV group). 
The SOCs with the highest proportions of AEs that occurred in subjects in the combined ustekinumab 
group were Gastrointestinal Disorders (26.4% in the placebo group and 22.3% in the combined 
ustekinumab group) and Infections and Infestations (22.1% in the placebo group and 22.0% in the 
combined ustekinumab group); the proportions of subjects in these SOCs were comparable between 
treatment groups and there was no evidence of a dose effect between the 2 ustekinumab dose groups. 
Pooled key data of the induction phase are summarised in the following table: 
A 1% difference in the proportion of subjects with the AEs of asthenia and acne between the 
ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV and placebo groups and an approximately 2.5-fold greater number of 
events in ustekinumab-treated subjects could be observed.  
The was a 1.7% difference in the proportion of subjects with the AE of vomiting between the 
ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV and placebo groups and an approximate 1.5 fold greater number of events 
in the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV group. 
An extract of table TSFAE01A showing the frequencies of asthenia, acne and vomiting is shown:

Pooled Data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies were consistent with that observed in the primary 
analysis (using Phase 3 data alone). 
Maintenance Phase 
The average duration of follow-up in study CRD3003 was similar for randomized subjects who received 
placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w, or ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w.  
The overall proportions of subjects with AEs were comparable amongst treatment groups with no 
evidence of a dose effect between the 2 ustekinumab dose groups (83.5% in the placebo group, 
80.3% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w group, and 81.7% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w 
group). 
The SOCs with the highest proportions of AEs in the combined ustekinumab group during maintenance 
were Infections and Infestations (48.9% of subjects in the placebo group and 46.8% of subjects in the 
combined ustekinumab group) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (47.4% of subjects in the placebo group 
and 39.2% of subjects in the combined ustekinumab group) with no evidence of dose effect between 
the 2 ustekinumab dose groups.  
The higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group who experienced AEs in the Gastrointestinal 
Disorders SOC compared with subjects in the combined ustekinumab group is not unexpected given 
the nature of the underlying disease when untreated. 
Pooled key data are summarised in the following table:

A 2% difference in the proportion of subjects with the AE of vulvovaginal mycotic infection between the 
ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w and placebo SC groups, together with a 4-fold greater number of events 
in the ustekinumab q8w group supporting the determination of vulvovaginal mycotic infection could be 
observed. 
An extract of table TSFAE01A showing the frequency of vulvovaginal mycosis is shown: 
Pooled Data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies were consistent with that observed in the primary 
analysis (using Phase 3 data alone). 
Safety for Combined Induction and Maintenance Phases (Up to 1 Year) 
Analyses were conducted combining data from the induction and maintenance phases of the Phase 3 
studies. These analyses were conducted on randomized subjects up to the time of dose adjustment 
and provide data for up to a total of 52 weeks of follow-up. 
Key safety events for up to 52 weeks of exposure show no evidence of a dose effect between 
treatment groups for each high-level safety topic, including the subgroup of subjects who received the 
recommended dosing regimen for Crohn’s disease (6 mg/kg IV induction followed by 90 mg SC q8w or 
q12w), as shown in table 9:

Infections, skin disorders (rash and itch), respiratory disorders (cough), vascular disorders (DVT), 
procedural complications and psychiatric disorders (depression) are more commonly associated with 
study drug. For vascular disorders where 7 subjects exposed to Stelara are recorded with venous 
thrombosis versus 0 for placebo exposure. 
The company carried out a re-evaluation of cases of thrombosis after day 120 of the current 
procedure. 2 subjects were re-classified resulting in 8 subjects with thrombosis in the Stelara group 
and 1 subject with thrombosis in the placebo group (table 30):

The total number of subjects in each group (placebo and Stelara) are small in terms of the detection of 
harm and so it is not apparent that detailed statistical analysis is helpful. On simple examination of 
table 31, however, the event rate of DVT per 100 person years in the ‘all-Stelara group’ is about twice 
that of the placebo group i.e. 1.25 v. 0.63, as shown in table 31:

By the primary analysis of pooled phase 3 data, the company did not find difference between study 
drug and placebo with regards to infection or infection requiring antibiotics.  
There was one event of presumed tuberculosis who was treated empirically. 
4 subjects (2 placebo-treated subjects and 2 ustekinumab-treated subjects) experienced AEs 
suggestive of a possible infusion reaction. All of the events identified in these subjects were assessed 
as mild or moderate severity, with the exception of severe dysponea reported in a subject that 
received a placebo infusion. The events were self-limited in all cases and required no intervention other 
than oral antihistamine. 
1.7% of subjects reported a placebo injection-site reaction and 3.0% reported an ustekinumab 
injection-site reaction. No serious injection-site reactions or injection-site reactions of severe intensity 
were reported. 
There were no possible anaphylactic reactions or possible serum sickness-like reactions in 
ustekinumab-treated subjects through approximately 1 year of treatment in the Crohn’s disease 
studies combined. 
In the combined Crohn’s disease studies, through approximately 1 year of treatment, for all 
malignancies, the incidence of malignancies per 100 subject-years of follow-up was comparable 
between placebo-treated subjects and ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.58 [95% CI:0.07, 2.09] in the 
placebo group and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.25, 1.31] in the combined ustekinumab group). 
MACE: through approximately 1 year of treatment, in the combined Crohn’s disease studies, there was 
1 event of a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to aneurysm rupture which was adjudicated as a non-fatal 
stroke in a non-responder to ustekinumab induction who subsequently received ustekinumab 90 SC 
q8w as maintenance treatment in study CRD3003. Overall, up to 1 year, there is no consistent 
evidence that ustekinumab increases cardiovascular risk. 
There were no events of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy reported.

Summary of Safety for Crohn’s Disease Pooled with Psoriasis and PsA 
A summary of key safety events from the Crohn’s disease studies compared with the pooled indications 
of Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and PsA, through approximately 1 year of follow-up, is shown in Table 3: 
Overall the safety data from the Crohn’s disease studies did not appear to have altered the safety 
profile of ustekinumab established in the approved indications of psoriasis and PsA 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Through approximately 1 year of treatment, there were no deaths in the combined Crohn’s disease 
studies. 
The company is aware of 5 deaths that occurred during the ongoing extension for CRD3003. The 
causes of death (3 presumed cardiovascular, 1 renal, and 1 suicide) are not atypical of an IBD 
population and a concerning pattern of events was not seen. 
Serious adverse events, Induction phase 
Pooled Data from Phase 3 Studies:  
Serious adverse events occurred at 6.0% in the placebo group, 4.9% in the ustekinumab 130 mg IV 
group, and 5.3% in the ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV group with no evidence of a dose effect.

The SOC with the highest proportions of SAEs that occurred in subjects in the combined ustekinumab 
group were Gastrointestinal Disorders (3.9% in the placebo group and 2.7% in the combined 
ustekinumab group). Infections and Infestations was the SOC that was next highest: 1.1% in the 
placebo group and 1.4% in the combined ustekinumab group.

Serious adverse events, maintenance phase 
Data from Phase 3 Study 
During the maintenance phase (up to the point of dose adjustment) in study CRD3003, the proportions 
of randomized subjects with SAEs were comparable between treatment groups with no evidence of a 
dose effect (15.0% in the placebo group, 12.1% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w group, and 9.9% 
in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w group).

Consistent with previous analyses, the SOCs with the highest proportions of SAEs were Gastrointestinal 
Disorders and Infections and Infestations and overall, the most frequently reported SAEs in both 
supportive analyses were Crohn’s disease, small intestinal obstruction, anal abscess, gastroenteritis, 
depression and deep vein thrombosis.

Infections / infestations, procedural complications, administration site conditions, psychiatric disorders 
(depression) and vascular disorders (DVT) were apparently more common in those exposed to study 
drug during the time period described by the above table.  
It is noted in the above table that the number gastro-intestinal events was similar in the study drug 
and placebo groups. 
4 subjects exposed to study drug developed a DVT versus none on placebo during the maintenance 
period, table TSFSE04F submitted by the company, as shown in the extract below: 
Laboratory findings

Q8W dosing versus Q12W dosing 
The overall proportions of subjects with AEs were comparable between treatment groups with no 
evidence of a dose effect between the 2 ustekinumab dose groups (83.5% in the placebo group, 
80.3% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w group, and 81.7% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w 
group) as shown in the extract of the following table: 
When results of treatment-emergent adverse events were classified as ‘reasonably related’, then the 
number of events recorded was higher in the q8W group (~133 events per 100 subject years) versus 
the q12W group (~115 events per 100 subject years), as shown in the following table extract. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 123/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The higher number of ‘reasonably related’ events appeared to be a function of infections, 
administration site conditions and skin & subcutaneous tissue disorders. The higher number of related 
events in the placebo group is understood to reflect symptoms of [placebo-treated] Crohn’s disease. 
The apparently higher rate of infection in the q8W group appeared to be reflected in the higher rate of 
antibiotic requirement in the q8W group (~62 events per 100 subject years) versus the q12W group 
(~55 per 100 subject years), as shown in the following table extract: 
Safety in special populations 
A trend in adverse event occurrence when results were analysed by sex, race, weight and severity or 
extent or duration of disease was not detected. 
A trend in adverse event occurrence when results were analysed by extrinsic factors such as 
concomitant Crohn's disease medications or Crohn's disease medication history was not detected.

The company has submitted the following table of adverse event by age of recipient from week 0 up to 
week 44 of the maintenance study: 
Despite small numbers of subjects in the age group of 65 to ≤ 74 years, no apparent differences in 
AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to study agent discontinuation, or system organ class were observed compared 
with subjects <65 years old. The number of subjects ≥ 75 years of age (n=3) was too small to draw 
any conclusions.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No studies of ustekinumab were conducted in pregnant or lactating women. 
As of 08 July 2015, 137 reports of pregnancy were identified in studies of ustekinumab in Crohn’s 
disease, psoriasis, PsA, MS, and healthy volunteers: 67 maternal pregnancies and 70 pregnancies with 
paternal exposure. Pregnancies and outcomes are presented by indication in Table 13 (maternal) and 
Table 14 (paternal).

In general, the outcomes seen in the ustekinumab pregnancies are comparable with what is expected 
in the general population. 
Immunological events 
The assays for antibodies and neutralising antibodies have been described in previous submissions. 
Phase II studies 
• 
• 
In the C0379T07 study, none of the subjects in this study were positive for antibodies to 
ustekinumab. 
In the C0743T26 study, 3 subjects were positive for antibodies and none experienced an AE 
temporally associated with an infusion or an injection-site reaction  
Phase III studies 
• 
• 
• 
In the CRD3001 study, 2 subjects were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab and neither 
reported an AE temporally associated with an infusion during their participation in the study. 
In the CRD3002 study, 1 subject was positive for antibodies to ustekinumab through Week 20 
and did not report an AE temporally associated with an infusion during participation in the 
study. 
In the CRD3003 study, 14 randomized subjects were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab 
and none experienced an injection-site reaction. 
Immunogenicity of ustekinumab is described for the Phase 3 studies from Week 0 of the induction 
studies (CRD3001 and CRD3002) through Week 44 of the maintenance study (CRD3003), a total of 52 
weeks exposure to ustekinumab [immunogenicity in the phase I and II studies was too low to permit 
analysis]. 
1,154 treated subjects received a dose of ustekinumab during induction or maintenance and had 
samples for antibodies. Of those, 27 subjects (2.3%; 14 in the randomized and 13 in the 
nonrandomized populations) were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab from Week 0 of an induction 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017

study through Week 44 of maintenance. Among these subjects who were positive for antibodies to 
ustekinumab, the majority (20 of 27 subjects) had titers ≤1:800. 
The incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was similar between randomized subjects who received 90 
mg q12w (3.0%, 4/132 subjects) and 90 mg q8w (2.3%, 3/131 subjects). 
Effect of Immunomodulators on Immunogenicity 
Sample sizes are small; the proportion of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab 
among those who received immunomodulators was 1.9% (7/375 subjects) compared with 2.6% 
(20/779 subjects) in subjects who did not receive immunomodulators. 
Serum Ustekinumab Concentrations and Antibodies to Ustekinumab 
The relationship between serum ustekinumab concentrations and antibody to ustekinumab status 
(positive or negative) in randomized subjects is shown in Figure 6. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 129/152 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Median serum ustekinumab concentrations were lower in subjects who were positive for antibodies to 
ustekinumab compared with levels in subjects who were negative for antibodies to ustekinumab. 
Neutralizing Antibodies 
Of the 27 treated subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab through Week 44 of 
treatment with ustekinumab, 17 (63.0%) were positive for Nab. 
Immunogenicity and Efficacy 
Among subjects receiving maintenance ustekinumab, no apparent impact on clinical efficacy was 
observed following the development of antibodies to ustekinumab. Because of the limited number of 
subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab (<3%, the majority were neutralizing), these 
analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
Antibodies to Ustekinumab and Safety Impact: Crohn’s Disease 
Overall, in the combined Crohn’s disease studies, no subject who was positive for antibodies had a 
reaction related to study agent administration. However, due to the small number of subjects who 
were positive for antibodies, caution should be used in interpreting the data regarding the association 
of antibodies to ustekinumab and study agent administration-related events. 
Relationship Between Serum Ustekinumab Concentration and Safety: Crohn’s Disease 
Overall, no relationship between ustekinumab exposure and safety events (ie, infections, serious 
infections, SAEs) were observed either for induction or maintenance at the dose levels evaluated in 
studies C0743T26 combined with CRD3001 and CRD3002; and the maintenance study CRD3003. 
Anaphylactic and Serum Sickness like Reactions 
There were no possible anaphylactic reactions or possible serum sickness-like reactions in 
ustekinumab-treated subjects through approximately 1 year of treatment in the Crohn’s disease 
studies combined. 
Injection-site reactions Phase 3 studies 
1.7% of subjects reported a placebo injection-site reaction and 3.0% reported an ustekinumab 
injection-site reaction. No serious injection-site reactions or injection-site reactions of severe intensity 
were reported. The most frequently reported injection-site reaction among all treated subjects was the 
established ADR of injection-site erythema which occurred in 1.1% and 1.7% of subjects receiving a 
placebo or ustekinumab injection, respectively. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal study of drug-drug interactions was performed with ustekinumab for this line extension and 
this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Induction Phase 
Pooled Data from Phase 3 Studies 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued due to an AE was higher in the placebo group (4.1%) 
compared with the ustekinumab 130 mg IV group (1.7%) and ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV group 
(1.7%). 
The SOC with the highest proportions of discontinuations was Gastrointestinal Disorders (3.2% in the 
placebo group, 0.8% in the ustekinumab 130 mg IV group, and 0.6% in the ustekinumab ~6 mg IV 
group).  
These observations are not unexpected given the underlying nature of disease within the overall 
subject population. Other AEs leading to discontinuation generally occurred as single events without 
any notable patterns with regard to SOC or type of event. 
Pooled Data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies were consistent. 
Maintenance Phase 
Data from Phase 3 Study 
The overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was comparable between treatment groups 
(6.0% in the placebo group, 7.6% in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w group and 3.1% in the 
ustekinumab 90 mg q8w group). 
The SOC with the highest proportions of discontinuations was Gastrointestinal Disorders (4.5% [6 
subjects] in the placebo group, 3.8% [5 subjects] in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w group, and 
1.5% [2 subjects] in the ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w group) 
Pooled Data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies were consistent. 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing information has been accruing since the first  marketing authorisation of the product in 
January 2009.  
As of 31 December 2014, ustekinumab has been approved in 84 countries worldwide for the treatment 
of adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and/or active psoriatic arthritis. 
The estimated cumulative worldwide exposure to ustekinumab from launch to 31 December 2014 is 
379,596 person-years.

The cut-off date for post-marketing data in this application procedure is 31 December 2014, and 
through this time period, eleven Periodic Safety Update Reports have been completed.  
Based on the post marketing safety surveillance, erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, 
hypersensitivity reactions (including rash, urticaria), and serious hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis and angioedema) were identified as ADRs. 
The company will continue to monitor the safety profile of ustekinumab and report the safety findings 
as appropriate. 
Postmarketing Registry: PSOLAR 
Ustekinumab is also being evaluated in the Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR), 
a multi-centre, prospective, observational study that tracks the long-term safety experience and 
clinical status of patients with psoriasis who are eligible to receive (or are actively receiving) systemic 
therapies for psoriasis. 
The post-marketing commitment for PSOLAR was to enrol 12,000 patients with moderate to severe 
psoriasis, including 4,000 receiving ustekinumab, with the rest receiving or eligible to receive other 
systemic therapies. PSOLAR enrolment has completed. As of the most recent data cut-off on 23 August 
2014, 12,093 patients have enrolled in PSOLAR, with a median registry follow-up of 3.3 years, and an 
accumulated 40,388 patient-years of follow up. 
Thus far, data analysis conducted for the PSOLAR registry has not identified any new safety signals for 
ustekinumab. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database from the 5 Crohn’s disease clinical studies comprises 1749 ustekinumab-treated 
subjects (a total of 1106 subject years of follow-up) and includes 849 subjects exposed for at least 6 
months, and 464 subjects exposed for at least 1 year.  
Adverse events identified as related to exposure to Stelara (both intravenous and subcutaneous 
administrations) were consistent with known events described in the SmPC. The company has now 
identified the additional events: asthenia, acne, vomiting and vulvo-vaginal mycotic infection. These 
additional adverse events were taken over into the SmPC and are considered to be manageable with 
routine risk minimisation.  
IV infusion was not associated with anaphylaxis or serious infusion reactions within the current 
development programme. Information on serious adverse events was consistent with information in 
the current SmPC. 
Data for all subjects treated within maintenance study CRD3003 showed that infections, skin disorders 
(rash and itch), respiratory disorders (cough), vascular disorders (DVT), procedural complications and 
psychiatric disorders (depression) are more commonly associated with study drug and are reflected in 
the SmPC / RMP.  
There were 7 subjects exposed to Stelara recorded with venous thrombosis versus 0 for placebo 
exposure). The company carried out a re-evaluation of cases of thrombosis after day 120 on request of 
the CHMP. 2 subjects were re-classified, which resulted in 8 subjects with thrombosis in the Stelara 
group and 1 subject with thrombosis in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 132/152 
 
  
  
 
 
The total number of subjects in each group (placebo and Stelara) is small in terms of the detection of 
harm and so it is not apparent that detailed statistical analysis is helpful. However, the event rate of 
DVT per 100 person years in the ‘all-Stelara group’ is about twice that of the placebo group i.e. 1.25 v. 
0.63 and there may be biological plausibility for an association between ustekinumab and venous 
thrombotic events as interleukins are involved in the pathophysiology thrombosis and haemostasis. It 
is noted that further analysis by the company of other studies, post-marketing experience and a 
literature search did not detect an association but taken together there is a suspicion of an association 
and the MAH was requested to add “venous thromboembolism” as an important potential risk to the 
RMP.  Additional pharmacovigilance for this safety concern will include monitoring as an outcome of 
interest in the registry study for the Crohn’s disease indication as well as in the long term extension 
study to CRD3003 as described in the RMP. 
2.3% of subjects in the clinical trials developed antibodies to Stelara. No apparent association between 
the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was 
observed. The clinical consequences of antibody development have not yet been established in the 
population of Crohn’s disease but this issue may be clarified when the company submits results of the 
on-going long-term extension of study CRD3003 as described in the RMP. 
Over the course of study CRD3003, the number of treatment-emergent adverse events recorded as 
reasonably related’ was higher in the q8W group (~133 events per 100 subject years) versus the 
q12W group (~115 events per 100 subject years). The higher number of ‘reasonably related’ events 
appears to be mainly a function of infections, administration site conditions and skin & subcutaneous 
tissue disorders and this appears to be reflected in the higher rate of antibiotic requirement in the q8W 
group (~62 events per 100 subject years) versus the q12W group (~55 per 100 subject years). 
Since the q8W group would be administered Stelara on only 6 occasions and q12W group would be 
administered Stelara on only 4 occasions during the course of study CRD3003, it is considered that 
differences in clinical safety are likely to become more apparent on more prolonged exposure with the 
q8W group likely to experience more adverse events than the q12W group. 
Despite small numbers of subjects in the age group of 65 to ≤74 years, no apparent differences in 
AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to study agent discontinuation, or system organ class were observed compared 
with subjects <65 years old. The number of subjects ≥ 75 years of age (n=3) was too small to draw 
any conclusions. Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that although no differences in safety profile have 
been seen in this population the number of elderly patients exposed is not sufficient to determine 
whether they respond differently from younger patients, and because there is a higher incidence of 
infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used in treating the elderly. These 
statements are considered adaequate as routine risk minimisation measures. 
Studies of ustekinumab were not conducted in pregnant or lactating women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, 
parturition or postnatal development. Therefore the existing precautionary statement in the SmPC to 
preferably avoid the use of Stelara in pregnancy is considered adequate. There is no information on 
exposure of Stelara to the paediatric population as the paediatric development was deferred by the 
PDCO. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall the safety data from the Crohn’s disease studies did not appear to have altered the well 
characterized ustekinumab safety profile established in the approved indications of psoriasis and PsA. 
Over the course of study CRD3003, the number of treatment-emergent adverse events recorded as 
reasonably related’ was higher in the q8W group (~133 events per 100 subject years) versus the 
q12W group (~115 events per 100 subject years). Since the q8W group would be administered Stelara 
on only 6 occasions and q12W group would be administered Stelara on only 4 occasions during the 
course of study CRD3003, it is considered that differences in clinical safety are likely to become more 
apparent on more prolonged exposure with the q8W group likely to experience more adverse events 
than the q12W group. As this counterbalance the improved efficacy of the q8W group the initial s.c. 
standard dose was amended to dosing every 12 weeks (with potential increase to q8w in case if 
inadequate response; see also discussion on efficacy of this report). 
On the basis of the limited amount of safety data available for long-term use in Crohn’s disease “long-
term safety in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease” was, similar to the 
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications included by the company into the RMP as an area of missing 
information. The CHMP agreed to include the ongoing long-term extension study to study CRD3003 (to 
evaluate the safety of 2 SC maintenance regimens) as additional pharmacovigilance activity into the 
RMP alongside a post-marketing registry (both category 3). The applicant committed to submit the 
protocol of the latter for assessment within 12 months after marketing authorisation. This study will 
collect information related to various outcomes, including prospective assessment of safety concerns 
such as malignancies and infections, analysis of the potential impact for disease modification of 
treatment with biologics, evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, and appraisal of the evolution of patient-
reported outcomes. Also the important potential risk “venous thromboembolism” will be monitored as 
an outcome of interest in the registry study.

legislative requirements was performed on the Stelara SC PL at the time of the initial 
marketing authorization application procedure, which was approved on 16 January 2009. 
•  Additional user consultation testing was performed in July 2015, as part of the procedure to 
extend the psoriasis indication to include children from 12 to 18 years of age (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/00958/II/0042). In general, readability of the currently approved Stelara SC PL in 
the adult and adolescent patient groups fulfilled the EU requirements for user testing, however 
some changes to the layout of multi-lingual leaflets are required. This change will also be 
implemented for the new 130 mg concentrate for solution for infusion presentation.

• 
The Applicant believes that the contents of the proposed Stelara IV and SC PLs have not 
significantly changed compared to the currently approved Stelara SC PL. For both the SC and 
IV PLs, the changes are related to the addition of the new indication Crohn’s disease and have 
an impact on section 1 “What Stelara is and what it is used for”, section 3 “How to use Stelara” 
and to a limited extent on section 4 “Possible side effects”.

however, as Stelara (ustekinumab) 5.0 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion, is a 
prescription medicine intended for IV administration to patients by healthcare professionals in 
a hospital setting, there is no impact for patients. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Patients present with persistent diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss.  
The indication claimed is: 
STELARA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, were intolerant to, or have 
medical contraindications to either: 
• 
• 
Conventional therapy, or 
TNFα antagonist therapy. 
The beneficial effects that are important in the management of Crohn’s disease are induction and 
maintenance of remission (i.e. resolution of all signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease) in association 
with endoscopic and histological evidence of maintenance of lack of pathology in the gut mucosa. 
Reduction (and preferably stopping) in exposure to corticosteroids is also considered to be important. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of medical care for Crohn’s disease involves anti-inflammatory therapeutic 
approaches, which include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds, corticosteroids, immune-
modulators including azathioprine (AZA) or its active metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 
methotrexate (MTX), and biologic agents including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapies 
and anti-integrin therapies. Even with combinations of the available therapeutic options, many patients 
do not attain clinical benefit or cannot tolerate the therapy. 
All agents have significant adverse event profiles. Among patients who receive TNF antagonist 
therapies for Crohn’s disease, 20% to 40% are primary non-responders and among those with an 
initial response, ~40% lose their response over time. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical picture of Crohn’s disease may be described using the CDAI tool; the company has used 
the CDAI tool to establish the baseline status of subjects enrolled into the clinical studies and to follow 
progress. The company has undertaken an endoscopy sub-study with histology of biopsies and 
exposure to corticosteroids was assessed consequent to exposure to Stelara in the main clinical 
studies.

Studies CRD3001 and CRD3002 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multi-centre studies. The target population in both studies consisted of men or women ≥18 years old 
with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (of at least 3 months duration), defined as a CDAI 
score of ≥220 and ≤450. 
In CRD3001, subjects had received infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab pegol at a dose approved 
for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, and either did not respond initially, responded initially but then 
lost response or were intolerant to the medication. 
CRD3002 included subjects who had failed conventional therapy (ie immunomodulators and / or 
corticosteroids; including subjects who were corticosteroid-dependent). Subjects in CRD3002 could 
have been treated with TNF antagonist therapy in the past but must not have met the failure criteria 
specified for CRD3001. Subjects were permitted to receive concomitant Crohn's disease medications; 
the dosage was to remain stable (including corticosteroids) without initiation or increase through Week 
8. 
All subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single IV administration of placebo or 1 of 2 
induction doses of ustekinumab at Week 0: 
• 
Placebo 
•  Ustekinumab 130 mg 
•  Ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg 
At Week 6, all subjects were evaluated for the primary endpoint of clinical response (defined as a 
reduction in CDAI of ≥100 points or to <150 for subjects with a baseline score ≥220 to ≤248).  
Those subjects who achieved clinical response under ustekinumab at week 8 were eligible to enter 
study CRD3003 as the primary population. 
Study CRD3003 was a multi-centre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized 
withdrawal study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC regimens of ustekinumab maintenance 
therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who were induced into clinical 
response with IV ustekinumab. The maintenance portion of the study was through Week 44 [a 
subsequent study extension will continue up to Week 272].  
The primary population was those who were in clinical response to IV ustekinumab induction therapy 
at Week 8 of either the CRD3001 or CRD3002 induction studies. 
Subjects in the primary population were randomized at Week 0 of the maintenance study to 1 of the 
following 3 treatment groups: 
• 
Placebo 
•  Ustekinumab 90 mg SC every 12 weeks (q12w; with final dose at Week 36) 
•  Ustekinumab 90 mg SC every 8 weeks (q8w; with final dose at Week 40) 
Subjects underwent tapering off of oral corticosteroid medications. All other Crohn's disease-related 
medications were to remain stable through Week 44 of the maintenance study. 
The primary end-point was clinical remission at Week 44 where clinical remission is defined as a CDAI 
score of < 150 points.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study CRD3001 
• 
The proportion of subjects in clinical response at Week 6 (the primary endpoint) was greater in 
both the ~6 mg/kg (33.7%) and 130 mg (34.3%) ustekinumab groups than in the placebo group 
(21.5%; p=0.003 and p=0.002, respectively). 
• 
The proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 8 (the first major secondary endpoint) 
was greater in both the ~6 mg/kg (20.9%) and 130 mg (15.9%) ustekinumab groups than in the 
placebo group (7.3%; p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively). 
Study CRD3002 
• 
The proportions of subjects in clinical response at Week 6 (primary endpoint) were greater in 
both the ~6 mg/kg (55.5%) and 130 mg (51.7%) ustekinumab groups than in the placebo group 
(28.7%, p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
• 
The proportions of subjects in clinical remission at Week 8 (the first major secondary endpoint) 
were greater in both the ~6 mg/kg (40.2%) and 130 mg (30.6%) ustekinumab groups than in the 
placebo group (19.6%, p<0.001 and p=0.009, respectively). 
Both studies CRD3001 and CRD3002 met their primary end-points. 
Study CRD3003 
For the primary endpoint of clinical remission at Week 44, a higher proportion of subjects in the 90mg 
ustekinumab QW8 and 90mg ustekinumab QW12 groups were in clinical remission at Week 44 (53.1% 
and 48.8%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (35.9%; p=0.005 and p=0.040, 
respectively). The study met its primary end-point.  
The major secondary endpoint of corticosteroid-free remission at Week 44 in CRD3003 was achieved 
by a greater proportion of subjects in the ustekinumab 90 mg q12w and q8w groups (42.6% and 
46.9%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (29.8%).  
In a subgroup of patients with draining fistulas at baseline (8.8%; n = 26), 12/15 (80%) of 
ustekinumab-treated patients achieved a fistula response over 44 weeks (defined as ≥  50% reduction 
from baseline in the number of fistulae draining upon gentle compression) compared to 5/11 (45.5%) 
exposed to placebo. 
For those exposed to Stelara, both serum CRP concentration and fecal content of calprotectin fell over 
the first 8 weeks of induction compared to placebo, presumably reflecting a reduction in inflammatory 
burden for those who received Stelara. Thereafter in the maintenance phase, both serum CRP 
concentration and fecal content of calprotectin were relatively stable over the course of 44 weeks in 
those who received Stelara. 
For those exposed to Stelara, both the IBDQ and SF-36 scores rose over the first 8 weeks of induction 
compared to results for the placebo group. Scores were relatively constant thereafter in the Stelara 
group over the course of the 44 week maintenance phase. Further, the results of the work limitations 
questionnaire, time lost from work questionnaire and the productivity visual analogue scale did not 
convince of difference between the Stelara and placebo groups over the course of the maintenance 
phase. 
Endoscopic appearance of the mucosa was evaluated in 252 patients with eligible baseline endoscopic 
disease activity in a sub-study. At week 8, after a single intravenous induction dose, the primary 
endpoint of change from baseline in Simplified Endoscopic Disease Severity Score for Crohn’s Disease

(SES-CD), a composite score across 5 ileo-colonic segments of presence/size of ulcers, proportion of 
mucosal surface covered by ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface affected by any other lesions and 
presence/type of narrowing/strictures. The change in SES-CD score was greater in the ustekinumab 
group (n = 155, mean change = -2.8) than in the placebo group (n = 97, mean change = -0.7, 
p=0.012). 
95 subjects went forward for endoscopy in study CRD3003. A statistically significant difference in SES-
CD score between study drug and placebo groups was not found at week 44. The high fall-out of 
subjects over the maintenance study and consequent potential for selection bias makes it difficult to 
interpret results from the maintenance phase. 
Durable clinical remission was defined by the company as a post hoc exercise that required subjects in 
clinical response at baseline in study CRD3003 to be in remission at 80% of visits prior to Week 44 and 
also at Week 44 (i.e. at least 9 of 11 visits in the CRD3003 study). 37% of subjects in the combined 
Stelara group were in durable clinical remission versus 23.7% of subjects in the placebo group 
(p<0.005). Results are consistent with the primary endpoint of study CRD3003. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
When considering remission over time in the subset of responding subjects that were in remission 
upon entry to CRD3003 (i.e. remission in remitters), there was a gradual decline over time to 66.7% 
at Week 44 in the q8w group (with a lower proportion of 56.4% on q12w) i.e. (about) 40% reduction 
in clinical remission over the course of study CRD3003. 
Similarly, for clinical response, there was a gradual 40% reduction in the proportion of subjects who 
remained in clinical response. 
It is considered that it has not established whether ‘loss of remission’ or ‘loss of response’ reach a 
plateau within 44 weeks or whether loss of remission and response is on-going. Data are provided in 
5.1 of the SmPC so that prescribers are informed about the efficacy maintenance profile of Stelara 
which is considered satisfactory.  It is anticipated that this issue may be clarified by the proposed 
extension study to study CRD3003. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Major issues were not identified by the clinical assessment. 
Adverse events identified as related to exposure to Stelara (both intravenous and subcutaneous 
administrations) were consistent with known events described in the SmPC. The company has now 
identified, in addition: asthenia, acne, vomiting and vulvo-vaginal mycotic infection. These additional 
adverse events were taken over into the SmPC and are considered to be manageable with routine risk 
minimisation. 
Over the course of study CRD3003, the number of treatment-emergent adverse events recorded as 
‘reasonably related’ was higher in the Q8W group (~133 events per 100 subject years) versus the 
Q12W group (~115 events per 100 subject years). The higher number of ‘reasonably related’ events 
appears to be mainly a function of infections, administration site conditions and skin & subcutaneous 
tissue disorders and this appears to be reflected in the higher rate of antibiotic requirement in the Q8W 
group (~62 events per 100 subject years) versus the Q12W group (~55 per 100 subject years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 146/152 
 
  
  
 
Subsequently the s.c. standard dose was amended to dosing every 12 weeks (with potential increase 
to q8w in case if inadequate response. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
When events of both thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis were considered together in the safety data 
up to week 44 in CRD3003 the event rate per 100 patient-years was 1.25 (95% CI 0.57 – 2.38) for all 
ustekinumab and 0.63 (0.02 – 3.53) for placebo. The point estimate for ustekinumab is higher than for 
placebo, although the confidence intervals are wide and overlapping.   
The overall evidence did not suggest a causal relationship with ustekinumab but as a biologic 
plausibility for IL-12/23 inhibitors to induce venous thrombosis exists venous thromboembolism was 
included as an important potential risk into the RMP. 
Information in elderly is very sparse. Although no differences in safety profile have been seen in this 
population there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general and a 
precautionary statement was added in 4.4. of the SmPC .

3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The attainment of clinical remission in subjects with Crohn’s disease who have not responded to 
current therapies is considered to be very important.  
The reduction in corticosteroid exposure is also important because of the adverse events associated 
with corticosteroids though not all subjects were able to stop corticosteroids; further, the reduction in 
adverse events of corticosteroid exposure needs to be counterbalanced by the adverse events 
associated with exposure to Stelara. 
From a clinical perspective, unfavourable effects identified in the development programme for Stelara 
in the management of Crohn’s disease mainly reflect unfavourable effects that are already known from 
the previous development programme in psoriasis namely nasopharyngitis and headache. Most were 
considered to be mild and did not necessitate discontinuation of study treatment. The most serious 
adverse reaction that has been reported for STELARA is serious hypersensitivity reactions including 
anaphylaxis. It is considered that the unfavourable effects are tolerable and amenable to clinical 
management.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Stelara is considered to meet an unmet medical need by offering clinical efficacy to those patients with 
moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost 
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a TNFα antagonist or have medical 
contraindications to such therapies. 
The new mode of administration (induction treatment with intravenous and maintenance treatment 
with subcutaneous administration) can be considered a clinical benefit compared to intravenous 
administered therapies. 
The attainment of clinical remission in subjects with Crohn’s disease who have not responded to 
current therapies coupled with reduction in exposure to corticosteroids far outweighs the unfavourable 
effects, especially since the unfavourable effects are considered to be tolerable and amenable to 
clinical management. 
Assessment report  
EMA/87810/2017 
Page 149/152 
 
  
  
 
 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In study CRD3003, the increase in absolute rate of clinical remission at week 44 for q8w administration 
versus q12w was 4.3% (rate ratio 1.09) and the increase in absolute rate of clinical response at week 
44 for q8w administration versus q12w was 1.3% (rate ratio 1.02). The q8w administration was 
associated with a higher frequency of ‘related’ adverse events compared to q12w administration; it is 
considered that the difference in clinical safety between the two frequencies of administration will 
become more apparent with more prolonged exposure. Further, the higher rate of adverse events 
associated with the q8w administration is considered to counterbalance the increased efficacy 
associated with the q8w frequency such that the overall benefit risk balance of the q8w and q12w 
frequencies are considered to be equivalent. Therefore, the s.c. standard dose (after the first s.c. dose 
applied 8 weeks after the intravenous dose) was amended to dosing every 12 weeks (with potential 
increase to q8w in case of inadequate response). 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Stelara is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of the line extension on Stelara, 5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion, 45 mg and 90 mg solution for injection and prefilled syringe  is favourable in the following 
indication: 
STELARA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a TNFα antagonist or have medical contraindications to such therapies. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

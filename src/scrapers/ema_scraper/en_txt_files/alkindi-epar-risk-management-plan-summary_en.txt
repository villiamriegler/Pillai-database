Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Alkindi® 
(Hydrocortisone Granules in Capsules for opening) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Alkindi. The RMP details important risks of 
Alkindi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Alkindi's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Alkindi's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Alkindi should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Alkindi should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Alkindi's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Alkindi is authorised for replacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and 
adolescents (from birth to <18 years old).  It contains Hydrocortisone as the active substance and it is 
given by mouth. 
Further information about the evaluation of Alkindi’s benefits can be found in Alkindi’s EPAR, including 
in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=/pages/medicines/human/medicines/004416/human_
med_002221.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Alkindi together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Alkindi's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Alkindi is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Alkindi are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Alkindi. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the 
medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: 
Growth Retardation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Growth retardation has been well recognised in children on chronic 
to the medicine 
steroids and is dose-related.  The situation in adrenal insufficiency 
may be complicated by the underlying disease and/or comorbidities.  
In congenital adrenal hyperplasia an initial phase in the first six 
months of life of relative insensitivity to androgens is followed by 
androgen sensitivity where growth can be accelerated by androgen 
excess, however this is accompanied by bone age acceleration 
leading to precocious puberty, early fusion of epiphyses and 
compromised final height.  Conversely, overdose of steroids will 
suppress this androgen effect but cause growth retardation.  Some 
studies, but not all, suggest that steroid dose in the first two years 
of life is critical to final height. In secondary adrenal insufficiency 
due to pituitary dysfunction, ACTH deficiency is often accompanied 
by growth hormone deficiency which will impact height regardless of 
the appropriateness of steroid dose.  Growth hormone 
supplementation can improve final height expectation, but it may be 
difficult to disentangle the various factors affecting growth.  Despite 
a progressive reduction in steroid dosing seen since the introduction 
of steroid therapy for CAH in the 1950s, even recent cohort studies 
at doses close to the guidance range seem to have an effect on final 
height.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
The effect on final height appears to be limited to patients with CAH.  
The evidence from historical cohorts is equivocal as to whether this 
is associated with hydrocortisone dose, fludrocortisone dose or both.  
There are no studies showing a final height impact on patients with 
Addison’s disease.  With hypopituitarism the picture is complicated 
by other pituitary hormone deficiencies that may affect growth- 
notably Growth Hormone Deficiency

Important identified risk: 
Acute Psychiatric Effects 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Psychosis is a well-known phenomenon with chronic high dose 
to the medicine 
steroid use.  Commoner still is euphoria on first starting therapeutic 
doses of steroids.  There have also been reports of suicidal ideation 
with steroids. In general, the psychiatric effects of steroids have 
been thought to be dose-related and so of less relevance to 
replacement therapy.  Although a few important case reports of 
psychiatric symptoms in adults on replacement doses of 
hydrocortisone- summarised in a paper from 2015, have been seen, 
these effects have not been seen in paediatric patients.  A brief 
literature review describes two cases of manic episodes, four cases 
of overt psychotic symptoms with hallucinations and one report of 
delirium.  Reassuringly, the effects seen in adults were limited in 
duration and reversed with reduction in replacement steroid dose. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Reactions are seen most often at initiation or withdrawal of therapy.  
Reactions such as agitation or euphoria commonly seen in 
therapeutic use and effects seem to be dose related, but have been 
seen in adults occasionally at initiation of replacement dose.

management and 4.8 communicating specific symptoms 
Important identified risk: 
Reduced Bone Mineral Density and Risk of Bone Fractures 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Cohorts of adult patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have 
to the medicine 
been shown to have lower bone mineral density than age and sex 
matched controls, though this is not seen in all cohorts. These 
differences seem to be height dependant though studies in patients 
on replacement levels of hydrocortisone seem to show no clear 
correlation with steroid dose, with other factors such as 
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels being implicated.  
Overall our understanding of the nature of bone mineral density 
changes in CAH is evolving, but bone mineral density should be 
monitored and glucocorticoid dose kept to the minimum necessary. 
Appropriate advice is included in the proposed SmPC.  
Pharmacovigilance can help improve our understanding of the inter-
relationship, if any, between replacement steroids and bone mineral 
density. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with CAH seem to be at higher risk of reduced bone mineral 
density than patients with other forms of adrenal insufficiency, 
perhaps reflecting the relative doses of glucocorticoids used in these 
populations.  Female patients seem to be at higher risk of fracture 
than controls, though this has not been shown in a male population.  
 
 
 
 
Dexamethasone usage may increase the risk over other replacement 
glucocorticoid regimens.  Other recognised causes of reduced bone 
density may increase risk further e.g. immobility. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
Text in SmPC section 4.2 includes European Society of Paediatric 
Endocrinology dosing guidance and monitoring guidance, section 
4.4 and PIL further information related to the risk. 
Important identified risk: 
Drug-drug interactions (with CYP3A4 enzyme inducers and CYP3A4 inhibitors) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Hydrocortisone is a drug substance for which considerable 
to the medicine 
experience of use in man is available, and the body of scientific 
knowledge is based on a combination of literature references from 
published pharmaco-toxicological information including scientifically 
accepted monographs and clinical trials, along with results of post-
marketing experience gained by widespread clinical use.  However 
much of the data described is from high dose usage and is not 
relevant at replacement doses.  In replacement use there are only a 
few case reports of interactions.  Interaction with Phenytoin was 
described in a child with AI requiring hydrocortisone dose increase.  
Interaction with Oxcarbazepine was described in an adolescent with 
AI requiring Hydrocortisone dose increase.  In adults interaction with 
Rifampicin has been described causing increased metabolism of 
hydrocortisone leading to crisis.  Finally in adults Grapefruit Juice 
and Liquorice have been found to increase cortisol availability 
through CYP3A4 inhibition.  Although the main component of 
Liquorice, Glycyrrhizin, has no effect on CYP3A4, other constituents 
particularly (3R)-vestitol, 4-hydroxyguaiacol apioglucoside and 
liquiritigenin 7,4'-diglucoside are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. From the 
literature therefore it can be expected that known CYP3A4 inhibitors 
or inducers will affect hydrocortisone requiring potential dose 
adjustment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Most children, unlike older adults do not suffer from multiple co-
morbidities and so tend to be on one or few drugs only.  However 
some children with severe congenital conditions, or those with 
syndromic causes of adrenal insufficiency may have several organ 
systems involved and so be at higher risk of being on multiple 
medicines.

Important potential risk: 
Choking on the capsule 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Potential only- no incidents of this occurring, and no data to suggest 
to the medicine 
this happens currently with compounded hydrocortisone that is 
traditionally dispensed in capsules. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Children with carers with learning difficulties or limited literacy in the 
language used on the patient information leaflet accompanying the 
pack (e.g. First generation immigrants). 
Risk minimisation measures

only and should not be administered. 
Important potential risk: 
Accidental Underdose 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Granules were retained in adult studies Infacort001 and 003 and 
to the medicine 
paediatric study Infacort003. None of these were significant in terms 
of drug dose (maximum 0.04mg).  Instruction to tap the capsule 
was introduced and no episodes of granule retention have been 
reported in the ongoing study Infacort004.

Important potential risk: 
Drug-drug interactions seen only at high doses of Hydrocortisone (with aspirin, coumarins, 
diuretics, anti-hypertensives, drugs or substances causing hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemic 
agents) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Hydrocortisone is a drug substance for which considerable 
to the medicine 
experience of use in man is available, and the body of scientific 
knowledge is based on a combination of literature references from 
 
 
 
published pharmaco-toxicological information including scientifically 
accepted monographs and clinical trials, along with results of post-
marketing experience gained by widespread clinical use.  
Examples of the medicines implicated would be 
Aspirin 
Coumarin anticoagulants e.g. Warfarin 
Diuretics e.g. Acetazolamide, loop diuretics e.g. Frusemide, thiazides 
e.g. Indapamide, Bendroflumethiazide Chlortalidone Xipamide

Sotalol, Labetalol), Alpha blockers (e.g. Doxazosin, Indoramin, 
Prazosin, Terazosin) Calcium channel blockers (e.g. Verapamil, 
Diltiazem, Amlodipine, Nifedipine), Clonidine, Diazoxide, 
Methyldopa, Moxonidine, Nitrates (e.g. Glyceryl Trinitrate, 
Isosorbide Dinitrate), Nitroprusside, Hydralazine, Minoxidil, 
Guanethidine, ACE inhibitors (e.g. Captopril, Enalapril maleate,

Hypoglycaemic agents e.g. (e.g. Insulin- human and porcine/bovine, 
Glibenclamide, Gliclazide, Glimepiride, Glipizide, Tolbutamide, 
Nateglinide, Repaglinide). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with 11β hydroxylase deficiency leading to CAH often 
present with hypertension and so may be on anti-hypertensives, 
however these interactions have not been described at replacement 
doses of hydrocortisone 
Risk minimisation measures 
Text in SmPC section 4.1 Alkindi is indicated for replacement 
therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and adolescents 
(from birth to <18 years old). 
Important potential risk: 
Risk of Central Serous Chorioretinopathy 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Long term pharmacovigilance data on steroids has revealed an 
to the medicine 
association between usage of steroids and a rare form of eye 
disease; chorioretinopathy 
Risk factors and risk groups 
This association has been seen with all forms of steroids including 
inhaled and topical and appears to be more likely with higher doses 
of steroid therapy.

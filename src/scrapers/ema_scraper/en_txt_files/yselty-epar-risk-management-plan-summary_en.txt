Summary of risk management plan for YSELTY (linzagolix) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  YSELTY.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of YSELTY, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about YSELTY's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
YSELTY's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how YSELTY should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for YSELTY should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
YSELTY's RMP. 
I.
The medicine and what it is used for
YSELTY is authorised for treatment of moderate  to severe  symptoms of uterine  fibroids in 
adult women of reproductive age (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains linzagolix as 
the active substance and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of YSELTY’s benefits can be found in YSELTY’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/yselty. 
II.
Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further
characterise the risks
Important risks of YSELTY, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about YSELTY's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of YSELTY is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of YSELTY are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of YSELTY. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Important identified risk: Bone mineral density decrease 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
(GnRH)  antagonists  such  as 
Gonadotropin-Releasing  Hormone 
linzagolix  reduce  serum  oestradiol  (E2)  in  a  dose‐dependent  manner. 
These  declines  can  result  in  dose-dependent  bone  mineral  density 
(BMD)  decrease  due  to  increased  bone  resorption,  which  is  most 
pronounced with high doses with which close to full E2 suppression is 
reached.  The  aim  of  lower  doses  and  the  use  of  hormonal  ABT  with 
higher  doses  is  to  achieve  E2  levels  within  a  range  that  limits  BMD 
decrease. 
Linzagolix 200 mg (without concomitant add-back therapy (ABT)): 
Median  levels  of  serum  E2  for  the  200 mg  dose  showed  close  to  full 
suppression (<20 pg/mL), which was maintained at similar levels up to 
Week 24. BMD decrease related to linzagolix treatment was limited at 
24 weeks. The protective effect of ABT was clearly observed with long 
term treatment (more than 6 months) at higher dose (200 mg). Individual 
categorical analysis shows that very few subjects experienced >8% BMD 
decrease, most of these subjects were in the 200 mg dose arm. 
BMD decrease after short term use of GnRH agonists generally shows 
partial  to  complete  recovery  within  a  few  months  after  treatment 
completion.  There  was  also  evidence  of  recovery  after  short-term  (6 
months)  full  E2  suppression  in  the  Phase  2  EDELWEISS  linzagolix 
study  in  endometriosis  which  is  in  line  with  data  from  other  GnRH 
agonists. 
Linzagolix 200 mg (with concomitant ABT) and linzagolix 100 mg (with 
and without concomitant ABT): 
Only moderate reductions of serum E2 were observed with the 100 mg 
dose,  100  mg+ABT  and  with  200  mg+ABT  regimens  (on-treatment 
medians  ranging  from  27.00  to  48.00  pg/mL)  after  52  weeks  of 
treatment.  This  results  in  BMD  changes  which  were  generally  not 
clinically meaningful. 
Although  overall  the  BMD  changes  in  all  groups  were  clinically  not 
meaningful,  the  magnitude  of  BMD  decrease  was  observed  to  be 
different for linzagolix 100 mg group, 100 mg+ABT and linzagolix 200 
mg+ABT group (-2.36, -0.93 and -1.61 percent change from baseline at 
Week  52  at  lumbar  spine  for  the  100  mg,  100  mg+ABT  and  200 
mg+ABT dose, respectively). BMD decrease was more pronounced for 
linzagolix 100 mg group as compared to linzagolix 200 mg+ABT group 
and linzagolix 100 mg+ABT group (at week 24 and 52). This suggests 
that the changes in BMD with the 100 mg and 200 mg linzagolix dose 
were clearly seen to be  mitigated by the concomitant use of hormonal 
ABT. 
When  the  10-year  fracture  probability  was  assessed  with  the  FRAX® 
tool (web version 4.2) in all PRIMROSE patients assuming continuing 
linear  rates  of  BMD  loss  over  up  to  5  years  of  duration,  the  analysis 
suggests that  the treatment could be given  for  at  least  5 years  without 
significant concerns about bone health. With regard to the 100mg dose, 
the mean FRAX probabilities remain well below intervention thresholds 
whereas  the  200mg  with  concomitant  ABT  demonstrate  even  lower 
probabilities of future fracture risk (Study 20-OBE2109-006). 
Also,  overall,  there  was  evidence  of  recovery  in  BMD  24  weeks 
following treatment discontinuation at Week 52 in both groups. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Major risk factors for decreased BMD include low body weight/ body 
mass index (BMI), chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, family history 
of osteoporosis, hypogonadism, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce 
bone  mass  such  as  glucocorticoids  and  anticonvulsants.  The  use  of 
linzagolix in these patients may further contribute to BMD decrease. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• Treatment duration limitation to 6 months in summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) section 4.2 and package leaflet (PL) section 
3.
• Contraindication  for  patients  with  known  osteoporosis  in  SmPC 
section 4.3 and PL section 2.
• Recommendations in SmPC section 4.4 and PL section 2 to assess 
baseline  BMD  and 
to  carefully  weigh  risk-benefit  before 
commencing  YSELTY  treatment  in  patients  with  a  history  of  a 
low-trauma  or  fragility  fracture,  or  other  risk  factors  for 
osteoporosis or BMD decrease.
• Recommendation to perform a DXA scan after 1 year of treatment
for all women and thereafter annually (for YSELTY 100 mg) or at
a  frequency  determined  by  the  treating  physician  based  on  the
woman’s  individual  risk  and  previous  BMD  assessment  (for
YSELTY  100  mg  with  concomitant  ABT  and  YSELTY  200  mg
with concomitant ABT) in section 4.4.

Important potential risk: Uterine endometrial and mammary gland adenocarcinoma 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
During  a  104-week  carcinogenicity  study  conducted  in  Wistar  rats, 
higher incidence of uterine endometrial at high dose (500 mg/kg/day) and 
mammary  gland  adenocarcinoma  at  mid-dose  (50 mg/kg/day)  was 
observed;  this  higher  incidence  of  uterine  endometrial  and  mammary 
gland adenocarcinoma was judged to be incidental. 
The mechanism mediating this effect is unclear and does not appear to be 
related either to genotoxicity, or the primary pharmacological activity of 
linzagolix.  The  data  available  are  not  sufficient  to  conclude  on  the 
potential  clinical  relevance  of  these  findings.  Therefore,  only  as  a 
precaution “Uterine endometrial and mammary gland adenocarcinoma” 
is listed as important potential risk. 
During clinical studies, only 1 incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma 
was  observed  in  the  PRIMROSE  1  and  PRIMROSE  2  studies  in  the 
100 mg+ABT group. For this event, a pre-existing lesion was detected in 
the  screening  biopsy.  This  event  was  considered  as  not  related  to 
linzagolix but to ABT treatment. In addition, 2 events of breast cancer (1 
in the linzagolix 200 mg group, and the other in linzagolix 200 mg+ABT 
group  (both  from  PRIMROSE  1  and  2  studies)  were  diagnosed.  One 
more SAE of breast cancer was reported in Study KLH1201 in the 50 mg 
group. All three events were considered unrelated to linzagolix.

Important potential risk: QT Interval Prolongation 
In Study 17-OBE2109-001 (TQTc study), a positive QTc prolongation 
signal was observed following single doses of both 700 mg and 200 mg 
linzagolix. The 700 mg and 200 mg doses, at 3 hours post dose, were 
found to prolong QTcF with least squares mean (LSM) of 9.92 msec 
(90% confidence interval (CI) 8.03 - 11.81) and 8.34 msec (90% CI 6.44

10.23), 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
With the exception of the above finding, the results of ECG readings 
performed in Phase 3 did not raise any safety concerns. There were no 
QTcF prolongations >500 ms in the Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials (except 1 
Japanese subject in Phase 2 study KLH1204 who presented QT interval 
prolongation (QTc 519 ms) 29 days after the initial linzagolix dose of 
50 mg).  
QT interval prolongation and TEAEs in the SOC Cardiac disorders 
were explored in accordance with ICH guidance E14 Clinical 
evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic 
potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs (EMEA 2005). The rates of the 
following TEAEs were compared in the treated and control subjects: 
torsade de pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular 
fibrillation and flutter, syncope, and seizures. Except for one event of 
syncope, none of the other PTs were reported to date in the linzagolix 
clinical development program; 1 subject in the 100 mg group reported 
1 event of syncope which was not associated with QTcF prolongation 
(QTcF values ≤453 ms at all assessments). 
Patients  with  known  cardiovascular  disease  or  family  history  of  QT 
interval  prolongation,  hypokalaemia,  or  in  patients  consuming  other 
concomitant  medicinal  products  that  prolong  the  QT  interval,  or  in 
patients  with  co-existing  disorders  leading  to  increased  linzagolix 
plasma levels. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• Warning in section 4.4 that linzagolix marginally increases the QT 
interval;  recommendation  to  exercise  caution  when  prescribing 
linzagolix in patients with known cardiovascular disease or family 
history of QT prolongation, hypokalaemia, and in concomitant use 
with  other  medicinal  products  that  prolong  the  QT  interval;  and 
caution  when  prescribing  linzagolix  in  patients  with  co-existing 
disorders leading to increased linzagolix plasma level.

Important potential risk: Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Linzagolix reproductive and developmental toxicology was assessed in 
a female rat fertility study (0.16, 0.8, 4, 20, 100 mg/kg/day), an early 
embryonic  development  study  in  rats  (100,  300,  1000  mg/kg/day), 
embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  rats  (30,  100,  300  mg/kg/day) 
and  rabbits  (0.3,  3,  30  mg/kg/day),  and  pre-  and  postnatal 
developmental studies in rats (0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg/day). Due to its 
mechanism  of  action, linzagolix prevented  conception  and  reduced 
implantation in rats and resulted in embryo-foetal mortality, total litter 
loss  or  abolished  pregnancy in  rat  and  rabbit  embryo-foetal 
studies. There were no teratogenic effects and no adverse effect on the 
pre- and postnatal development of the offspring. 
In the clinical studies of linzagolix, patients were regularly evaluated 
for pregnancy, and any pregnancy that occurred was followed up for 
any  evidence  of  treatment-related  issues,  including  the  pregnancy 
outcome and neonatal condition. 
With limited exposure of pregnant women to linzagolix, effects on 
human pregnancy are not known. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
A major risk factor for women of childbearing potential is non-use of 
contraception  in  the  context  of  sexual  activity  during  linzagolix 
treatment.  Irregular  bleeding  may  occur  during  treatment  with 
linzagolix and may reduce the ability to recognize the occurrence of a 
pregnancy in a timely manner. 
Pregnancy testing should be performed if pregnancy is suspected, and 
linzagolix should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• Contraindication in pregnant women in SmPC section 4.3 and 4.6
and in PL section 2
• Warning that linzagolix does not consistently inhibit ovulation and
women on treatment may be at risk of pregnancy in the event of
unprotected  intercourse  in  SmPC  section  4.6  and  should  be
advised to use effective non-hormonal contraception to women of
childbearing potential.
• Warning  on  change  in  menstrual  bleeding  pattern  and  reduced
ability to recognise pregnancy in SmPC section 4.4.

Important potential risk: Liver Toxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) are potentially a class effect with 
GnRH antagonists as it has also been reported with elagolix and relugolix 
treatment (Schlaff, 2020; Osuga, 2019, Carr, 2018 and MYFEMBREE® 
prescribing information). However, no reports of cases meeting Hy’s law 
criteria/ of  confirmed  liver  toxicity  were  reported  to  date  in  subjects 
treated with linzagolix. 
Supporting  data  from  nonclinical  studies  in  dogs  and  monkeys  have 
shown that increases in serum liver enzymes could occur with linzagolix 
treatment. These studies concluded that linzagolix was not cytotoxic for 
hepatocytes and that increases in serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and 
glutamate  dehydrogenase  (GLDH)  were  likely  to  be  attributable  to 
induction of ALT and GLDH in the liver by the pharmacological effects 
of linzagolix. The findings were considered to be of low concern due to 
the  therapeutic  indices  at  the  respective  no-observed-adverse-effect 
levels  (NOAELs),  the  absence  of  histological  liver  findings  and  the 
confirmation of reversibility following treatment free recovery periods. 
In  linzagolix  multiple  dose  studies,  liver  enzymes  were  closely 
monitored from Phase 1 to pivotal Phase 3 studies. Both Phase 3 uterine 
fibroid  studies  included  regular  testing  of  liver  function  parameters. 
Alanine  transaminase  (ALT),  aspartate  transaminase  (AST),  gamma-
glutamyl  transferase  (GGT),  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP),  total  and 
indirect bilirubin were assessed from blood samples taken at Screening, 
Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 28, 32, 36, 52, and during follow-up at the 
Week 64 visit. As observed with other GnRH antagonists, liver enzyme 
elevations occurred. The rate of elevations >3x ULN was low and none 
were  associated  with  a  bilirubin  increase  >  2  ULN  and/or  INR 
(International normalized ratio) increase > 1.5 ULN; i.e., no cases met 
criteria for Hy’s law. 
In the pooled safety analysis of PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 
studies (N=1037) up to Week 24, 50 subjects (4.8%) reported 72 
events of increases in liver function tests. The majority of these events 
were increases in GGT (28 subjects; 2.7%), ALT (22 subjects; 2.1%), 
or AST (15 subjects; 1.4%). Most were considered as related to 
linzagolix and very few led to permanent discontinuation of drug, but 
none were considered serious. Between Week 24 and Week 52 in the 
pooled safety analysis of PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 studies, 
increases in LFTs were reported infrequently as TEAEs (ALT increase 
in 0.7% (5/757), GGT increase in 0.5% (4/757), and AST increase in 
0.4% (3/757)). Only few LFT abnormalities were reported as TEAEs 
at week 64 for both the studies.

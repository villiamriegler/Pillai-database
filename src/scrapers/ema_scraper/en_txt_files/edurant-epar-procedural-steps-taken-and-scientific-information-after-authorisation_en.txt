are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

which shows that the risk for HIV patients, who are well 
treated, to sexually transmit HIV to their partner is 
exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of 
antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was 
published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 
2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post-
exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently 
updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 
BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-
exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient 
with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on 
the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to 
reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective 
suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to 
substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a 
residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent 
transmission should be taken in accordance with national 
guidelines.

vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an 
IC50 of <2.7 nM and that the clinical implications of 
this finding are currently unknown. 
The package leaflet was revised accordingly and the 
MAH proposed to update the contact details of the

introduced an administrative correction to the 
address of the manufacturer both in annex II and in

study was designed to assess the effect of steady-state 
rilpivirine on OCT2 in vivo, by evaluating its effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of the OCT2 substrate, metformin, in 
healthy adult subjects. 
The study showed that rilpivirine 25 mg q.d. had no effect 
on the plasma pharmacokinetics of metformin and its urine 
clearance. 
An in vitro test showed that rilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor

package leaflet was updated accordingly.  
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to bring 
the PI in line with the latest QRD template version, 
including the black symbol and explanatory 
statements for medicines under additional 
monitoring. Other minor revisions made were 
correcting the values at week 96 of the ‘basal cortisol

rewording for greater clarity in SmPC section 5.1 
how in vitro resistance is determined. 
In addition the list of representatives in the leaflet

25 mg q.d. rilpivirine, the AUC, Cmax and Cmin for 
rilprivirine decreased by 42, 31 and 48%, respectively 
while an increase in the rilpivirine dose to 50 mg q.d. lead 
to an increase of rilpivirine AUC and Cmax of about 16 and 
42%, while Cmin decreased 7%. The observed differences, 
compared to a 25 mg q.d. dose of rilpivirine, were 
considered safe and efficacious and it was considered that a 
rilpivirine dose of 50 mg q.d could compensate for the 
inducing effect of rifabutin.  
The CHMP therefore agreed that the contraindication for 
coadministration of Edurant with rifabutin could be replaced 
with a warning in SmPC section 4.4 and instructions in 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.5 stating that when Edurant is co-
administered with rifabutin, an additional 25 mg tablet of 
rilpivirine per day is recommended to be taken 
concomitantly with Edurant, for the duration of the rifabutin 
co-administration.

concentration (IC50) value of 3.4 μg/ml. While rilpivirine 
plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers and in HIV-1 
infected patients are below this level, theoretically the 
intestinal concentration of rilpivirine after administration of 
a 25 mg oral dose could be up to 100 μg/ml. Therefore 
rilpivirine could potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of P-
gp substrates. 
The results from study TMC278IFD1001 demonstrated that 
the pharmacokinetics of the P-gp substrate digoxin is not 
affected by rilpivirine, administered at the recommended 
25 mg daily dose. This was further substantiated by urinary 
excretion data. However, the CHMP noted that digoxin is 
not very sensitive to inhibition of intestinal P-gp, thus it 
cannot be concluded that there is no effect of rilpivirine on 
more sensitive substrates of intestinal P-gp, such as

glucuronyl-transferase (UGT) 1A1-mediated pathway (main 
[inactive] metabolite: raltegravir glucuronide). Raltegravir 
has a low propensity for causing drug interactions with 
substrates of CYP enzymes (such as rilpivirine) as it is not a 
substrate, an inhibitor, or an inducer of CYP enzymes.  
Rilpivirine is a substrate of CYP3A and is unlikely to affect 
metabolic enzymes (including UGT) to a clinically relevant 
extent. No interaction is expected.   
This is confirmed in the currently submitted phase I study, 
based on data obtained in 23 subjects.

Rilpivirine is a substrate of CYP3A, therefore plasma 
between rilpivirine and telaprevir.

concentrations of rilpivirine could be increased when 
coadministered with telaprevir. This is confirmed in the 
currently submitted phase I study in healthy volunteers. 
Including the results of all subjects, the data showed that 
rilpivirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 78, 49 and 93%,

results of the pivotal studies C209 and C215 and the 
results of the 240 weeks of phase IIb trial 204. The 
MAH took the opportunity of this update to include in 
sections 8 and 9 of the SmPC the marketing 
authorization number and the date of the first 
marketing authorization respectively. The PL was 
updated to reflect the new data. In addition, the MAH 
proposed to update the list of local representatives in 
the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the MAH proposed 
this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest 
QRD template version and to correct spelling 
mistakes. 
The requested group of variations proposed 
amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, labelling and 
Package Leaflet.

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
were observed for the FTC/TDF backbone which is the 
background regimen in the fixed dose combination. Week 
96 data confirm the safety of the product, no additional 
safety warnings became apparent after week 48. 240 week 
results of phase IIb trial 204 confirm the safety of the 
product. The benefit risk of the product remains positive.

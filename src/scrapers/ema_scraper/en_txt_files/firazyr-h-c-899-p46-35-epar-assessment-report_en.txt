1.  Introduction 
On 12 December 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Firazyr, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
TAK-667-3001: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Non-randomized Phase 3 Study to Assess the Safety, 
Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Subcutaneous Administration of Icatibant (TAK-667) in Japanese 
Children and Adolescents with Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema is a standalone study in EU but 
part of the paediatric clinical development programme in Japan.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Icatibant in a syringe (10 mg/mL) was administered as subcutaneous injection. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Firazyr (Icatibant) is authorised since 2008 in European Union for symptomatic treatment of acute 
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency. In 2017, the 
indication was extended to adolescents and children aged 2 years and older.  
Icatibant is a selective competitive antagonism at the bradykinin type 2 (B2) receptor. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted final report for: 
•  TAK-667-3001: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Non-randomized Phase 3 Study to Assess the 
Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Subcutaneous Administration of Icatibant (TAK-667) 
in Japanese Children and Adolescents with Acute Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema  
The submitted study was conducted in Japan to support the use in paediatric patients aged 2 years and 
older with HAE. This paediatric indication was authorised on 24 August 2022.  
The study was completed on 26 July 2021 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
This was a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of SC 
administration of icatibant in Japanese children and adolescents from 2 to less than 18 years of age 
with acute attacks of HAE. 
Subjects eligible at pre-treatment physical examination and assessment received treatment with 
single-dose SC administration of icatibant per attack according to the subject’s body weight within 12 
hours after the onset of symptom.

During the study, subjects were closely monitored in the hospital/study center for at least 8 hours after 
administration of icatibant and received physical examinations and assessments to evaluate safety, 
efficacy and PK. After discharge, follow-up to assess the subject’s condition at >24-48 hours after final 
administration (Day 2) was conducted via a telephone call by investigators and follow-up of safety 
assessments were conducted 7 days after initial administration of icatibant (Day 8) at the study site. 
After having received initial treatment with icatibant, subjects who subsequently experienced an acute 
attack continued to receive treatment with icatibant for up to a total of 3 eligible icatibant-treated 
attacks. 
The study ended when at least 3 subjects were enrolled and/or when the planned enrolment period 
was completed. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Japanese children and adolescents (2 to 17 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed consent) 
with acute attacks of hereditary angioedema type I or type II. 
Treatments 
Up to 30 mg Icatibant in a syringe (10 mg/mL) was administered as subcutaneous injection using a 
five-weight-band dosing. 
The dosing is the same as the approved dosage and administration in the EU. 
Objective(s) 
To evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of icatibant for the treatment of acute attacks in Japanese 
children and adolescents with type I or type II HAE 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including injection site 
reactions 
Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary safety endpoints included electrocardiogram parameters, vital signs, Clinical laboratory 
parameters and immunogenicity (presence of anti-icatibant antibodies). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to onset of symptom relief and time to minimal symptom 
(several parameters studied), scoring of cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal symptoms of acute HAE 
attacks by an investigator-rated symptom score, subject self-assessment of HAE-related pain using the 
Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (4-17 years), investigator assessment of HAE-related pain using the 
Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale (2-<4 years), incidence of rescue 
medication use and the proportion of subjects with worsened intensity of clinical HAE symptoms 
between 2 and 4 hours after treatment with SC icatibant using investigator-rated symptom scores. 
Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints included plasma concentrations of icatibant and its major 
metabolites at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 hours after the first SC injection for an initial attack.

Sample size 
The planned sample size chosen of 3 subjects was based on the feasibility and was not statistically 
determined. 
Although there had been no accurate reports regarding the number of paediatric HAE patients in 
Japan, it was estimated approximately 30 to 50 patients based on the population estimate and the 
percentage of children among Japanese HAE patients confirmed in the latest Japanese HAE survey. 
However, comprehensive feasibility assessment for medical institutions across Japan found much less 
candidate subjects and only few clinical sites were able to conduct the study due to some hurdles in 
implementation. In addition, considering a difficulty to obtain informed consent in a paediatric study, 
the number of patients to be enrolled was assumed to be 3. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
N/A 
Statistical Methods 
Due to the small sample size, no statistical inferences (statistical test nor confidence interval) were 
performed 
Results 
Participant flow 
Screened: 6 subjects 
Enrolled: 2 subjects 
Treated with at least one dose of icatibant: 2 subjects  
HAE attacks treated during study: 4 (1 and 3 attacks, respectively, for the two participants)  
Baseline data 
Both subjects were 1-2 years of age at first HAE symptom. Time since last attack at first treatment 
was 2 and 3 months respectively for the two subjects.  
Efficacy results 
Both subjects experienced symptom relief and achieved minimum symptoms: 
Time to onset of symptom relief by an investigator-rated symptom score was 0.9 hour for Subject 
#001 and 1.0 hour for Subject #002 (all three attacks).  
Time to onset of symptom relief by Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) was 0.9 hour for Subject #001 
and 1.0 hour for Subject #002 (all three attacks).  
Time to minimal symptoms by an investigator-rated symptom score was 0.9 hours for Subject #001 
and 1.0 hour for Subject #002 (all three attacks).  
Time to minimal symptom as assessed by the FPS-R was 0.9 hour for Subject #001 and 1.0 hour for 
Subject #002 (all three attacks). 
Neither subject used rescue medication during the study period.

Safety results 
There were no TEAEs except for injection site reactions in this study. Subject #001 and #002 
developed mild to moderate injection site reactions and they had resolved by the time of the 
assessment at discharge.  
There were no deaths, no treatment-emergent SAEs, and no discontinuations due to a TEAE in this 
study. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Subject #001 was administered icatibant at a dose of 25 mg. Plasma concentrations of icatibant at 0.5, 
1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 hour post-first dose were 962, 856, 401 and 68.9 ug/L, respectively. Plasma 
concentrations of metabolite M-I were 106, 187, 220 and 137 ug/L and plasma concentrations of 
metabolite M-II were 103, 184, 227 and 151 ug/L, respectively. 
Subject #002 was administered icatibant at a dose of 15 mg. Plasma concentrations of icatibant at 0.5, 
1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 hour post-first dose were 978, 882, 410 and 38.8 ug/L, respectively. Plasma 
concentrations of metabolite M-I were 103, 223, 247 and 124 ug/L, and plasma concentrations of 
metabolite M-II were 116, 216, 276 and 147 ug/L, respectively. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Firazyr is authorised since 2008 in European Union for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of 
hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency. In 2017, the indication 
was extended to adolescents and children aged 2 years and older. 
The MAH has submitted the final study report from study TAK-667-3001. The study enrolled Japanese 
children and adolescents (2 to 17 years) with acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) type I or 
type II and was part of the paediatric clinical development programme in Japan. The primary objective 
was safety. 
Due to feasibility issues, the study had a planned study size of at last 3 screened subjects. During the 
study, 2 subjects were treated for in total 4 HAE attacks (1 and 3 attacks, respectively).  
Both subjects responded to treatment with Firazyr within 0.9 and 1 h, respectively, and no rescue 
medication was used. Both subjects reported transient injection site reactions. Except from this, there 
were no deaths, no treatment-emergent SAEs, no additional TEAE and no discontinuations due to a 
TEAE in this study. Observed concentrations were within previously reported exposure ranges, where 
safety and efficacy have been established. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
No indication of lack of efficacy and no new and unexpected safety issues emerged from the extremely 
limited Study TAK-667-3001 in Japanese children from the age of two years and adolescents with 
Hereditary angioedema. 
The benefit/risk ratio for the symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) 
in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency 
remains unchanged.

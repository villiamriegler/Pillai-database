Chemical class
Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine
Summary of mode of action
Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (20-valent, 
adsorbed) (hereafter referred to as 20vPnC) contains 20 
pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, each conjugated to a 
CRM197 carrier protein, which modifies the immune response to 
the polysaccharide from a T-cell independent response to a T-
cell dependent response. The T-cell dependent response leads to 
both an enhanced antibody response and generation of memory 
B-cells, allowing for an anamnestic (booster) response on re-
exposure to the bacteria. 
Vaccination with 20vPnC induces serum antibody production 
and immunologic memory against the vaccine serotypes. 
Antibodies to some polysaccharides may cross react with related 
types and provide some protection against additional serotypes.
Important information about its composition
20vPnC is a sterile liquid suspension for intramuscular (IM) 
administration of capsular polysaccharide antigens of 
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 
9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F, 
each individually conjugated to the nontoxic variant of 
diphtheria toxin CRM197, as a carrier protein.
Each prefilled syringe of 20vPnC is designed to deliver 2.2 Âµg 
of each serotype-specific polysaccharide conjugate, except for 
6B, which is 4.4 Âµg/dose. The vaccine is formulated in 5 mM 
succinate buffer containing 0.88% sodium chloride (NaCl), 
0.02% polysorbate 80 (PS 80), at pH 5.8, and aluminum 
phosphate at 0. 25 mg/mL aluminum as an adjuvant.

PART II. SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
Indication
The proposed indication in paediatric patients is:
ï· Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute 
otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children, and 
adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age. 
The currently approved indication for 20vPnC in the European Union is for:
ï· Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused 
by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals â¥18 years of age.
Incidence: 
The incidence of pneumococcal disease is age specific, with the highest incidence among 
children <5 years of age (particularly among <2 years of age) and older adults.1-3 Mucosal 
disease represents the majority of pneumococcal disease in all age groups. While IPD is less 
frequent, some clinical syndromes, such as meningitis and sepsis, are associated with a high 
case fatality ratio and risk of long-term sequelae. Streptococcus pneumoniae was included as 
1 of the 12 WHO global priority pathogens in 2017 because of its high burden of disease and 
increasing rates of antibiotic resistance in many countries.4
Impact of 7vPnC and 13vPnC on Pneumococcal Disease Burden in Children
The introduction of 7vPnC and 13vPnC in national paediatric immunisation programs 
globally has led to substantial reductions in cases and deaths due to pneumococcal disease 
through direct and indirect effects. 13vPnC alone was estimated to have prevented 
~175 million cases of pneumococcal infections and ~625,000 deaths among children 
<5 years of age globally between 2010 and 2019.5
Following the introduction of 7vPnC and 13vPnC in infant vaccination programs, a rapid, 
significant, and sustained reduction in all-cause and VT IPD was observed in children in 
many European countries compared with both the pre-7vPnC and pre-13vPnC periods.6-12 In 
Denmark, overall IPD in children <2 years of age decreased by 65%â82% from 55 cases per 
100,000 in 2000â2007 (pre-7vPnC period) to 10 and 19 cases per 100,000 in 2018 and 2019, 
respectively (13vPnC period).13 In England and Wales, following introduction of 7vPnC and 
13vPnC, overall IPD declined by 72% (95% CI: 65%â77%) and 74% (95% CI: 64%â81%) 
compared with the pre-7vPnC period among children <2 years and 2 to <5 years of age, 
respectively.6
The incidence of 13vPnC-type IPD declined by 88% in both the <2-year-old and 2 to 4-year-
old age groups in 2016â2017, compared with the 7vPnC period (2008â2010), highlighting 
the incremental impact of 13vPnC over 7vPnC.6 The reductions seen after 13vPnC was 
introduced into existing 7vPnC programs provide evidence that 13vPnC reduced IPD caused 
Page 11
by the 6 additional serotypes as a group and maintained reductions in cases due to the 
original 7vPnC serotypes.6,14-16 In addition, the serotype 6A component of 13vPnC provided 
cross protection against carriage acquisition and invasive disease caused by serotype 6C.6,17,18
The introduction of 7vPnC and 13vPnC also resulted in large declines in the incidence of 
paediatric pneumococcal mucosal disease in Europe and globally.19-33. Declines in the 
incidence of all-cause CAP were observed in Europe after the introduction of 7vPnC and 
13vPnC.11,22,29 In France, the incidence of paediatric CAP emergency department visits 
decreased by 44% (95% CI: 32â56%) from 6.3 to 3.5 cases per 1000 visits in children 
â¤15 years of age within 3 years of 13vPnC introduction.29 Vaccine impact against OM and 
mastoiditis have also been demonstrated after 13vPnC introduction.33-35 While there are no 
VE studies against OM from Europe, a longstanding surveillance site in Israel demonstrated 
13vPnC VE was 77.4% (95% CI: 53.3â92.1) against VT complicated OM including 89.0% 
[95% CI: 23.9â98.4] effectiveness against complicated OM caused by serotype 3.36,37 In the 
UK, all-cause OM incidence in children <10 years of age declined by 51.3% between 2002 
and 2012, from 135.8 episodes per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 134.4â137.3) to 
66.1 episodes per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 64.9-67.4).25
Both 7vPnC and 13vPnC also provided indirect protection of vaccinated and unvaccinated 
persons by reducing nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission of vaccine serotypes from 
vaccinated populations. Indirect protection is an important component of pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccination programs and has led to substantial declines among children too young 
to be vaccinated (<6 weeks of age), older children, and adults.21,38-41 In England and Wales, 
compared with the 7vPnC periods, the incidence of 7vPnC-type and 13vPnC-type IPD 
declined in all ages by 84% (95% CI: 80%â88%) and 64% (95% CI: 60%â68%), 
respectively, including 86% and 63% reductions among adults 45 through 64 years, 
respectively, and 84% and 47% reductions among â¥65 years of age, respectively.6
Despite reductions in disease due to 7vPnC and 13vPnC, a significant burden of paediatric 
pneumococcal disease remains, with a substantial proportion caused by the 20vPnC serotypes 
â mainly the 7 additional 20vPnC serotypes. By 2015, although paediatric pneumococcal 
deaths had declined by an estimated 51% since 2000, S pneumoniae still accounted for 
3.7 million cases of severe pneumococcal disease and 294,000 deaths in children <5 years of 
age globally.42
Pneumococcal Disease in Older Children
Although the incidence of pneumococcal disease is lower in older children and adolescents 
than in younger children, healthy older children and adolescents still have some risk of 
pneumococcal disease. Incidence, severity, and case fatality rates are significantly elevated 
among older children with risk factors for pneumococcal disease, such as chronic medical 
conditions, cochlear implants, asthma, and sickle cell disease, and particularly among 
children with immunosuppression or immunodeficencies.15,43-45 Risk of 13vPnC-type IPD 
was 27, 122, and 822 times higher among US children 6 through 18 years of age with SCD, 
HIV/AIDS, and hematologic malignancies, respectively, than among those without these 
conditions.45
Page 12
Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in Adults
IPD incidence rates in adults for surveillance years between 2013 and 2019 have been 
reported for several European countries. The annual incidence per 100,000 population in 
adults â¥65 years of age was between 22.2 and 51.06,46-50 and 30-day case fatality rates for 
IPD varied between 11% and 30% for adults â¥65 years of age.51-54  
The Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system of the US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) reported an incidence of 9.5 cases of IPD per 100,000 population in 
2017.55 An estimated 93% of 31,000 total US cases of IPD and 96% of 3590 associated 
deaths occurred in adults â¥18 years of age. The incidence (per 100,000 population of each 
age group) was highest among older adults (â¥85 years: 41.8; 75â84 years: 29.3; 65â74 years: 
20.8; 50â64 years: 16.6). There was a significant IPD case fatality rate of 13%, 11%, and 
23% in persons 65 through 74, 75 through 84, and â¥85 years of age, respectively.
S. pneumoniae also remains the leading cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults, with 
reported incidence rates between 0.51 and 1.5 per 100,000 in adults â¥65 years of age in 
Finland and France, respectively.56,57 Similar incidence has been reported in the US.58-60
Approximately one third of pneumococcal meningitis survivors develop neurologic sequelae, 
including hearing loss, followed by cranial nerve palsies, paresis, seizures, and 
hydrocephalus. The pooled prevalence of specific sequelae includes 21% with hearing loss, 
12% with cranial nerve palsies, 9% with spasticity/paresis, 7% with seizures, 7% with 
hydrocephalus, and 2% with visual impairment.61
Burden of IPD in Adults â¥65 Years of Age Due to 13vPnC and 20vPnC Serotypes
The introduction of paediatric vaccination programs with 7vPnC and 13vPnC have led to 
substantial reductions in IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in the paediatric population and 
older adults. However, despite the indirect effects from 13vPnC paediatric vaccination 
programs, the 13vPnC serotypes continue to circulate in the adult population and contributed 
between 19% and 48% of IPD cases in adults â¥65 years of age in the EEA in 201862 and to 
27% of IPD cases in adults in this age group in the US in 2017.63
Also, the reduction of 13vPnC-type IPD cases in the adult population have been partially 
offset in some countries by increases in non-13vPnC serotypes (Table 1), which have 
disproportionately affected older adults and those with underlying comorbidities. Of note, 
increases in disease due to serotypes not covered by 13vPnC (including those covered by 
PPSV23 only) have also been observed in countries that have adult PPSV23 immunisation 
programs with high vaccine uptake in the target population. The increased burden of disease 
due to non-13vPnC serotypes, and the inability of PPSV23 to provide long-term protection at 
the population level, has created an unmet need for an expanded valency pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine to protect older adults.

The 7 additional serotypes covered by 20vPnC but not 13vPnC (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, 
and 33F) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the remaining IPD disease burden. In 
the EU, serotype 8 is of particular concern, causing 14% of all IPD cases in older adults in 
2018, followed by 22F (7.4%), 12F (4.0%), 11A (2.8%), 33F (2.5%), 10A (2.3%) (Table 1). 
Overall, the serotypes included in 20vPnC represent 7 of the 10 most prevalent IPD serotypes 
in adults â¥65 years.
In addition, these serotypes have characteristics that make them medically important, 
including antibiotic resistance (11A, 15B), association with outbreaks (8, 12F), and a 
tendency to cause more severe disease (eg, association with meningitis and/or increased 
mortality rate) (10A, 11A, 22F).64-71
The percent of IPD in US adults â¥65 years of age in 2017 was determined using US CDC 
ABCs data.63 The 7 additional serotypes covered by 20vPnC but not 13vPnC accounted for 
approximately one-quarter of the remaining IPD burden. Serotypes 22F, 11A, 33F, 8, and 
15B were the 5 most prevalent. Together they accounted for 23.2% and individually they 
accounted for 9.4%, 4.4%, 3.8%, 3.3%, and 2.3%, respectively, of IPD. Of the 11 most 
common serotypes (3, 22F, 35B, 23A, 15A, 11A, 9N, 33F, 16F, 6C and 8, listed in 
descending order), 5 are 20vPnC serotypes (3, 22F, 11A, 33F and 8) and 6 are PPSV23 
Page 14
serotypes (3, 22F, 11A, 9N, 33F and 8), which has achieved population vaccination coverage 
between 60% to 70% over the past 10 years in this age group.72
The capsular polysaccharide of serotype 15B is highly related to 15C and has potential to 
induce cross-protective antibody to 15C. Serotype 15C has been shown to contribute 0.5% 
(in the EU) and 1.5% (in the US) of IPD in adults â¥65 years of age.62,63
Pneumococcal CAP in Adults
S. pneumoniae accounts for a significant amount of the global burden of lower respiratory 
tract infection cases. Studies from Europe have reported a high proportion of community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to S. pneumoniae in hospitalised adults. In a recent 
population-based cohort study from the UK, 36.6% of CAP cases in adults â¥16 years of age 
were caused by S. pneumoniae.73 Similar proportions were also found in the Netherlands, 
Germany, Spain, and Sweden, and by a meta-analysis of 35 pneumonia studies in adults 
predominantly conducted in developed countries.74-78
Based on surveillance conducted by the US CDC from January 2010 to June 2012 of adults 
with all-cause CAP requiring hospitalisation, S. pneumoniae was the most common cause of 
bacterial pneumonia in adults â¥18 years of age, accounting for 9.7% of all-cause CAP.79
S. pneumoniae was detected more frequently in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) 
support than in patients not requiring ICU support (8% vs 4%) and was associated with 
higher severity scores.80
Nonbacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia is much more common than bacteraemic 
pneumococcal pneumonia. The specific etiology of nonbacteraemic pneumonia is difficult to 
determine due to a decrease in microbiological testing and routine use of empiric antibiotic 
treatment prior to testing. Therefore, the burden of pneumonia in the literature attributed to 
pneumococci may even be underestimated.78 Use of diagnostic tests that do not rely on 
culturing a viable organism (eg, BinaxNOW and serotype-specific urinary antigen detection 
[UAD] assays) have identified a notable increase in proportion of pneumonia due to 
S. pneumoniae compared with culture alone (16.7% vs 4.6%).81
A study of pneumococcal disease of adults â¥50 years of age seen at inpatient and outpatient 
US Veteransâ Affairs facilities between 2002 and 2011 found that nonbacteraemic 
pneumococcal pneumonia (diagnosed by respiratory culture and corresponding clinical 
diagnosis) was 6-fold more prevalent than bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia.82
Similarly, 89.7% and 82.3% of adult cases of pneumococcal CAP large pneumonia 
surveillance studies in the UK (2013â2018) and Spain (2011â2014) were noninvasive.73,76
Regardless of the presence of bacteraemia, pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with 
complications and long-term sequelae in all age groups, including respiratory failure 
requiring hospitalisation, empyema, and necrotising pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic 
medical conditions,83 declines in quality of life,84 and with a significant increased risk of 
death within 30 days (acute) and 1 year (long-term) after the event.85 In recent studies of 
older adults hospitalised with pneumococcal pneumonia in the US, 7.6% experienced a 
cardiovascular event after hospitalization, 58% continued to experience cognitive impairment 
Page 15
6 months after hospitalization, and quality of life remained lower at 6 months post-
hospitalisation compared with before hospitalisation.83,84,86 The surveillance conducted in 
veterans found inpatient mortality rates of 9.5% and 29.1% associated with nonbacteraemic 
and bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, respectively.82 Thirty-day mortality of adults 
â¥18 years of age with pneumococcal CAP in Spain was 8% (10% for those with invasive 
CAP and 6% for those with noninvasive CAP), and in the Netherlands was 13% for those 
with invasive CAP and 9% for those with noninvasive CAP.87,88
Moreover, S pneumoniae has been identified as one of the most common pathogens in 
influenza-related secondary bacterial pneumonia.89 Coinfection with influenza and 
S pneumoniae may cause more severe disease than infection with either alone.90-92 Both 
pneumococcal pneumonia and IPD have been associated with severe and fatal cases of 
influenza during influenza pandemics, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.93-96
Additionally, bacterial coinfection or secondary infection, including with S pneumoniae, has 
been reported with COVID-19 infections, and may be associated with more severe disease, 
although estimates of frequency vary and may be lower than with previous influenza 
pandemics.97-103 Moreover, emerging data suggest that S pneumoniae may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract infections associated with respiratory viruses among 
adults.104-107
Burden of Pneumococcal CAP Due to 13vPnC and 20vPnC Serotypes in Adults
There exists a substantial burden of disease due to the 13vPnC and 20vPnC serotypes in adult 
CAP. The Pfizer UAD assay is a robust tool for clinical and epidemiological evaluation of 
both invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal disease in adults and provides an alternative to 
traditional serotyping methods from culture. The original UAD1 assay detects S. pneumoniae
serotypes covered by 13vPnC. In addition, the UAD2 assay has been developed to detect 11 
additional serotypes (2, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B/C, 17F, 20, 22F and 33F), including 
those in 20vPnC. UAD1 demonstrated 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and UAD2, 
92.2% sensitivity and 95.9% specificity, both against a gold standard of bacteraemic 
CAP.108,109
In a prospective, observational study of 518 adults â¥18 years of age hospitalised with 
radiologically-confirmed CAP in MalmÃ¶, Sweden, 13vPnC or 20vPnC serotypes were 
detected in 10.0% and 15.2% in adults â¥65 years of age (Table 2). CAP in individuals 
â¥65 years of age with high-risk conditions was also associated with a high proportion of 
13vPnC or 20vPnC-type pneumococcal disease (11.3% and 17.0%, respectively, Table 2).

In a study in US adults â¥18 years of age that enrolled patients with radiologically confirmed 
CAP across 10 US cities between October 2013 and September 2016. The percent of CAP 
attributed to 13vPnC or 20vPnC serotypes was assessed by culture and serotyping of 
S. pneumoniae isolates from standard-of-care specimens (including blood, sputum, and 
pleural fluid) and by UAD1 and UAD2 testing on urine samples.110 The number and percent 
of CAP patients positive for a 13vPnC or 20vPnC serotype is presented by age group in

In this regard it should be noted, that relying on only radiologically confirmed or 
etiologically confirmed outcomes likely substantially underestimate the public health benefits 
of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. A recent systematic literature review for Phase 3/4 
efficacy trials concluded that vaccine-preventable disease incidences (control group minus 
intervention group incidences) were 2.2- to 2.9-fold higher for clinically defined pneumonia 
compared with etiologically confirmed pneumococcal or vaccine serotype CAP in 
adults.112,113
In addition, the epidemiologic burden of pneumococcal disease attributable to the 20vPnC
serotypes was recently estimated in US adults, using published and unpublished data on 
incidence rates, serotype coverage, and mortality for IPD and pneumonia (Table 4).114 ABCs 
data from 2017 was used for IPD data. Data was extrapolated to the total US adult 
population, stratified by age and risk group.
Page 17
This analysis showed that an additional 9900 cases of IPD, 44,000 cases of inpatient 
pneumonia, 52,000 cases of outpatient pneumonia, and 4300 deaths are estimated to be 
caused by the 7 additional 20vPnC serotypes.

Prevalence:
Given the acute nature of the IPD onset, the prevalence estimates are not clinically 
meaningful and hence are not discussed.
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication â age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
Use in children at high risk of pneumococcal disease:
Children with functional or anatomic asplenia, particularly those with sickle cell disease, and 
children with immunocompromising conditions are at very high risk for invasive disease, 
with rates in some studies more than 50 times higher than those among children of the same 
age without these conditions (i.e., incidence rates of 5,000 to 9,000 per 100,000 population). 
Page 18
Other conditions that increase the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in children include 
chronic heart disease, lung disease (including asthma if treated with high-dose oral 
corticosteroid therapy), liver disease, CSF leak, and having a cochlear implant. Rates are also 
increased among children of certain racial and ethnic groups, including Alaska Natives, 
African Americans, and certain American Indian groups (Navajo and White Mountain 
Apache). The reason for this increased risk by race and ethnicity is not known with certainty 
but has also been noted for invasive Haemophilus influenzae infection (also an encapsulated 
bacterium). Attendance at a childcare center has also been shown to increase the risk of 
invasive pneumococcal disease and acute otitis media 2- or 3-fold among children younger 
than age 5 years. Children with a cochlear implant are at increased risk for pneumococcal 
meningitis.115
Studies have been published confirming that both 7vPnC and 13vPnC are safe and 
immunogenic in children at increased risk of pneumococcal disease (infants born 
prematurely and in children with SCD, HSCT, and HIV infection). Such studies with 7vPnC 
and 13vPnC were generally small, as these populations may be difficult to enroll, and often 
are noncomparative, as it may be unethical to include a control group of unvaccinated 
participants. The large number of safety and immunogenicity studies of 7vPnC and 13vPnC 
in high-risk paediatric and adult populations generally reflected the safety profile observed 
for 7vPnC and 13vPnC in the general population.116,117 As would be expected, immune 
responses were lower in immunocompromised individuals; however, the potential for 
significant benefit in this vulnerable paediatric population is recognized, and 
recommendations for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in immunocompromised and other 
high-risk individuals exist in a number of countries.45,118,119
Use in adults at high risk of pneumococcal disease:
The incidence of pneumococcal disease in adults increases substantially after 50 years of age, 
as does the mortality. The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and 
national and regional governmental recommending bodies across Europe have identified 
factors in addition to age in immunocompetent adults that can increase the risk of 
pneumococcal disease.119-121 Data from 3 large US health care claims databases indicate that 
adults 18 through 64 years of age with the most common at-risk conditions/factors, including 
diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic heart disease, and cigarette smoking, had rates of 
pneumococcal disease approximately 3- to 4-fold higher than the healthy population of the 
same age; persons with chronic lung disease had a rate 10-fold higher.122 In a study in 
Germany, adults 18 to 49 years of age with at least 2 underlying medical conditions or with a 
high-risk condition were at similar risk for developing pneumococcal disease as healthy 
adults â¥60 years of age (Figure 1).

Conditions

In the aforementioned study in Malmo, Sweden (Table 2), the proportion of CAP due to the
20vPnC serotypes in adults 18 through 64 years of age with a high-risk condition was 25.6%, 
which was the highest proportion among all the age and risk groups examined. Those 
18 through 64 years of age with an at-risk condition also had a higher proportion of 20vPnC 
serotypes detected (25.0%) compared with all adults â¥65 years of age (15.2%).
As shown in Table 3, the proportion of CAP due to the 20vPnC serotypes in US adults 
18 through 64 was also comparable to those â¥65 years of age (8.7% vs 7.0%), though data by 
risk status was not provided.
The risk of IPD is also increased in adults with certain comorbid conditions. Figure 2 shows 
data from a retrospective cohort study from the national dataset of laboratory confirmed IPD 
cases in England and Wales (2008â2009). Irrespective of age, immunosuppressed adults, or 
adults with chronic conditions such as diabetes; asthma; alcoholism; chronic cardiovascular, 
liver, or pulmonary disease; or smoking are at an increased risk for IPD when compared with 
healthy adults. For certain conditions (chronic kidney disease, HIV infection, chronic liver 
disease), the rates of IPD were higher in those 16 through 64, compared with those â¥65 years 
of age.

The main existing treatment options:
The currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for infant immunisation in the EU 
are Prevenar 13 and Synflorix (10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). Vaxneuvance 
(15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 15vPnC) is approved for an adult indication and 
recently received European Commission decision for a paediatric indication. Vaxneuvance 
contains conjugates for the 13vPnC serotypes plus serotypes 22F and 33F. 
In addition, PPSV23 is indicated for use in children >2 years of age at increased risk for 
pneumococcal disease. PPSV23 contains unconjugated pneumococcal capsular 
polysaccharides for 23 different disease-causing serotypes (including the 7 additional 
capsular polysaccharides in 20vPnC). Unconjugated polysaccharide vaccines elicit a T-cellâ
independent immune response. As a result, they do not induce robust responses in certain 
populations (eg, immunocompromised individuals and children <2 years of age), and do not 
generate immunologic memory, so that their protective effect wanes over 2 to 5 years.125-128
Given the limitations of unconjugated vaccines and the current and global emerging burden 
of pneumococcal disease due to the 7 additional serotypes of 20vPnC not covered by 
13vPnC, and specifically the 5 additional serotypes not covered by Vaxneuvance, a medical 
need exists for a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with expanded coverage in the paediatric 
population. 20vPnC is expected to address that unmet need, providing greater protection than 
existing therapies.
The currently available pneumococcal vaccines for adults are PPSV23, 13vPnC, 15vPnC,
and 20vPnC.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
S. pneumoniae are gram-positive encapsulated diplococci and a significant cause of disease 
associated with mortality and morbidity among children and adults.129,85 The capsular 
polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae play important roles in virulence and immune evasion 
mechanisms and are used to classify pneumococcal serotypes. Currently, 100 different 
serotypes have been identified, which vary both by the chemical structure of their 
seroreactive capsular polysaccharides and in their ability to cause disease, with the majority 
of invasive disease caused by a relatively limited number of serotypes.130,131
In a human host, S. pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx and can present with a variety of 
clinical manifestations. The clinical forms vary in prevalence, severity, and associated 
sequelae and can be grouped into 2 broad classifications:132
ï·
ï·
invasive disease, such as meningitis, bacteremic pneumonia, or primary bacteremia, and
noninvasive (or mucosal) disease, which includes nonbacteremic pneumonia, sinusitis, 
and AOM.
Invasive Pneumococcal Disease: Serotypes causing pneumococcal disease are evolving, 
highlighting the need to expand protection against additional medically relevant serotypes 
and to maintain protection against the 13vPnC serotypes. A global meta-analysis of 
surveillance data from 42 sites with mature 13vPnC paediatric programs estimated that the 
7 additional 20vPnC serotypes account for ~36% of IPD cases in children <5 years of age.133
Eight serotypes accounted for ~52% of IPD in 13vPnC-using sites, including serotypes 
15B/C (9.5%), 12F (5.8%), 10A (5.5%), 22F (5.3%), and 33F (4.3%).
In Europe, an estimated 35% and 33% of IPD in 2019 are due to the 7 additional 20vPnC 
serotypes among children <1 and 1 through 4 years of age, respectively, based on IPD 
surveillance from 26 European countries.134 The most common 20vPnC serotypes were 8 and 
10A among children <1 year of age and 10A and 15B/C among children 1 to 4 years of age 
in 2019 (Figure 3). In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial decline in the 
number of IPD cases was observed but IPD rates have rebounded to at or above pre-COVID 
levels.135,136

Pneumonia: A substantial burden of bacteremic pneumonia including parapneumonic 
effusions and empyemas are caused by the 20vPnC serotypes.7,11,26 While the serotype 
distribution of nonbacteraemic pneumonia currently cannot be determined due to the lack of 
sensitive and specific diagnostic tests,137 evidence of the substantial proportion of 
bacteraemic pneumonia due to the 20vPnC serotypes and the impact of pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccines on all-cause pneumonia suggest 20vPnC will likely help protect against 
childhood pneumonia. 21,26
Acute Otitis Media: AOM is a common infection in young children worldwide â one of the 
most common reasons for clinic visits and antimicrobial prescriptions in developed countries. 
The majority of AOM is due to bacteria, and among bacterial OM globally, S pneumoniae is 
one of the most common causes, causing 24% and ~26% of cases as reported from studies in 
the USA and Israel, respectively, during the 13vPnC period.28,138 Studies in France, 
Germany, Israel, and USA during the 13vPnC period found that 12% to 31% of acute or 
complicated pneumococcal OM cases were caused by the 7 additional 20vPnC serotypes not 
covered by 13vPnC (Ben-Shimol, Pichichero, JMI Laboratories, and Kaplan datasets on 
Page 23
file).139-142 While mortality is rare, certain clinical presentations of OM, especially those 
caused by S pneumoniae, are associated with significant morbidity given their severity, 
complexity, and propensity for sequelae including hearing loss.143
Overall: The unmet need in Europe for paediatric pneumococcal disease is substantial. A 
modeling analysis of 9 European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, 
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) estimated that 1082 IPD cases, 65,124 
pneumonia cases, 780,236 AOM cases per year in children <5 years of age are caused by 
20vPnC serotypes, representing an annual direct healthcare cost of approximately 
â¬166 million per year.144
The 7 additional serotypes were not only selected based on their prevalence in IPD and 
mucosal disease around the world, but also on characteristics that make them medically 
important, including antibiotic resistance (10A, 11A, 15B and the closely related 15C, 22F, 
and 33F),145-148 association with outbreaks (8, 12F),149-152 and a tendency to greater disease 
severity such as an association with meningitis60,153,154 or higher case fatality rates (10A, 
11A, 12F, 15B/C, 22F, 33F)155,156 (Table 5).

In summary, 7vPnC and 13vPnC have substantially reduced the burden of disease due to 
S. pneumoniae globally. Nevertheless, pneumococci remain an important cause of IPD, 
pneumonia, and AOM in children age <5 years in Europe and globally. The 20vPnC 
serotypes are among the most important causes of IPD, pneumococcal pneumonia, and AOM 
among children, and the 7 additional serotypes also have the potential to cause more severe 
disease, outbreaks, and antibiotic resistance. Thus, 20vPnC, with its expanded coverage for 
these 7 important serotypes has the potential to address this substantial unmet need in Europe 
and in the global paediatric population.

pneumonia complications, long-term sequelae in all age groups, and mortality rates.

Important co-morbidities:
It is widely accepted that the risk of pneumococcal infection is elevated among individuals 
who are either immunocompetent but have chronic medical conditions and/or have 
immunocompromising conditions. These individuals are frequently referred to by health 
agencies and vaccine recommending bodies as âat-riskâ and âhigh-risk,â 
respectively.122,157,158
Persons at highest risk of IPD include all persons with functional or anatomic asplenia (eg, 
from sickle cell disease or splenectomy), HIV infection, leukaemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin 
disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, nephrotic 
syndrome, or other conditions associated with immunosuppression (eg, organ or bone 
marrow transplantation) and those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, including 
long-term corticosteroids. At-risk conditions include asthma, chronic heart disease, chronic 
liver disease, chronic lung disease, chronic use of oral steroids, diabetes, trisomy 21, 
neuromuscular/seizure disorders, prematurity and low birth weight.157,158
Please also refer above for a discussion of pneumococcal infection in high risk/at risk 
population (see also Table 2, Figure 1, and Figure 2).77,123,124

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
The key studies in the nonclinical toxicity assessment for 20vPnC consisted of a 
GLP-compliant pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study, a fertility and developmental toxicity 
study, and a series of repeat-dose investigative studies in NZW rabbits. The investigative 
studies were conducted to evaluate an unexpected finding in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity 
study.
Expected findings related to 20vPnC administration in the initial pivotal repeat-dose study 
were consistent with those seen in rabbits administered an aluminum-containing vaccine, 
including injection site findings, increased fibrinogen and CRP, and expansion of germinal 
centers in the spleen and iliac and inguinal lymph nodes, and were not considered adverse.
An unexpected microscopic heart finding observed in a small number of rabbits administered 
20vPnC in the initial pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study drove heart-focused investigative 
studies and an extensive toxicity assessment. Ultimately, it was determined that the heart 
finding was not related to the vaccine or vaccine components. 
This conclusion was based on evidence that comparable heart findings can occur independent 
of the test article in rabbits, heart findings were not due to direct or immune-mediated 
cardiotoxicity, and comparable findings may be induced in rabbits with increased handling 
and study procedures suggesting the potential contribution of extrinsic factors such as stress, 
in the development of heart findings. Further, there is extensive safety experience with the 
vaccine components in marketed vaccines and/or biotherapeutic products, and no myocardial 
inflammation was identified in any species in the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with 
13vPnC or with the 7 new serotypes in c7vPnC. Finally, there have been no cardiac safety 
signals or cTnI elevations in human clinical trials with 20vPnC (when tested). The totality of 
the nonclinical and clinical data supports the conclusion that heart is not a target organ for 
20vPnC.
In a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study conducted in NZW rabbits, there 
were no 20vPnC-related effects on fertility, pregnancy, or the offspring.
In summary, the nonclinical safety findings related to 20vPnC administration represent an 
expected immune reaction to vaccine administration and are clinically manageable or 
acceptable risks in the intended population. The key safety findings from nonclinical studies 
and their relevance to human usage are presented in Table 6.

Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
Toxicity (key issues identified from acute or 
repeat-dose toxicity studies)
Single-Dose Toxicity
A separate single-dose toxicity study with 20vPnC has 
not been conducted; however, single-dose toxicity was 
evaluated after IM administration of the first of 5 doses 
of 20vPnC to male and female NZW rabbits in the 
initial pivotal 59-day (1 dose/2 weeks) toxicity study 
(Study 12GR385). There were no adverse test article-
related effects following single-dose administration.
Repeat-Dose Toxicity
In the initial pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study in 
rabbits, no 20vPnC-related clinical signs of toxicity 
were observed during the dosing or recovery phases 
(12GR385). 20vPnC-related changes in acute phase 
proteins and microscopic findings at the injection site 
and in the draining lymph nodes and spleen were 
consistent with those seen with administration of 
aluminum-containing vaccines. However, in a small 
number of rabbits administered 20vPnC, microscopic 
inflammation with degeneration/necrosis of cardiac 
myocytes or myocardial fibrosis was observed. Further 
investigations support that these cardiac findings were 
likely related to toxicity study procedures and handling, 
not directly related to 20vPnC, and unlikely to have any 
translational relevance to humans.
Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
No vaccine-related effects on female fertility or the 
development of fetuses or offspring were observed in a 
fertility and developmental toxicity study of 20vPnC in 
rabbits.

Findings related to 20vPnC administration were 
consistent with the administration of an 
aluminium-containing vaccine, including injection 
site findings, increased FIB and CRP, and 
expansion of germinal centres in the spleen and 
iliac and inguinal lymph nodes, and were not 
adverse.
In clinical trials conducted to date with 20vPnC, 
no serious unexpected, adverse reactions have 
been detected in healthy people. Additionally, no 
cardiac safety signals or cTnI were noted in 
human clinical trials with 20vPnC (when tested);

No effects are anticipated in pregnant women or 
their offspring.

Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
Safety pharmacologya
- Cardiac
Findings of inflammation with degeneration/necrosis of 
cardiac myocytes or myocardial fibrosis in the hearts of 
a small number of rabbits administered 20vPnC were 
observed in the initial pivotal repeat-dose toxicity 
study.
Subsequent additional repeat-dose investigative studies, 
including a saline-only rabbit study, and a detailed root 
cause analysis on the vehicle constituents indicated that 
the heart findings were not related to the vaccine 
conjugates or other vaccine components. Heart findings 
were not due to direct or immune-mediated 
cardiotoxicity, and comparable findings may be induced 
in rabbits with increased handling and study 
procedures, suggesting the potential contribution of 
factors such as stress in the development of heart 
findings.
- Respiratory and neurologic
No clinical signs indicative of respiratory or neurologic 
system effects were observed in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity study in rabbits.
Other toxicity-related information or data: NA
a. No genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, safety pharmacology, or studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions were conducted. These studies are generally not considered necessary to support the 
development and licensure of vaccine products for infectious diseases.159,160.

Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure
The clinical development of 20vPnC for paediatric and adult immunisation was modelled 
upon the experience and clinical data of 13vPnC. The immunogenicity, safety, and 
postlicensure data on effectiveness with 13vPnC are relevant to 20vPnC since the vaccines 
are manufactured and formulated similarly and contain the same 13 polysaccharide 
conjugates 
Paediatric population
The paediatric clinical development program for 20vPnC consists of 5 completed2 clinical 
trials (1 phase 2 and 4 phase 3 studies), as outlined below:
Phase 2 studies

Across all 5 clinical trials, 5987 paediatric participants received at least 1 study vaccination: 
3664 participants received 20vPnC and 2323 received control vaccine. Additionally, four 
participants were randomized to 13vPnC but received at least one dose of 20vPnC (Dose 1: 1 
in B7471013; Dose 2: 2 in B7471011; Dose 4: 1 in B7471011). Those were included in the 
exposure summaries based on the first time they were exposed to 20vPnC in the studies. 
They were excluded from the safety summaries from the first analysis period as they received 
incorrect study vaccination.

Module SV. Post-Authorisation Experience
SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure
Due to various dosage regimens and country-specific vaccination schedules, it is not possible 
to determine with certainty the number of individuals who received 20vPnC vaccine at the 
data-lock point of this RMP. Estimated worldwide unitsâ distribution may serve as a 
reasonable indicator of patient exposure.
With these caveats in mind, the estimated cumulative worldwide unitsâ distribution for 
20vPnC from launch to 07 June 2023 is approximately 12,936,385 doses. 
Cumulative estimated exposure by gender, age group, and region based on the MAHâs 
internal sales data and factored, as applicable, by data from IQVIA from launch through 
07 June 2023, is summarized in Table 18 and Table 19, separately for US/Puerto Rico (PR) 
and ROW (excl. US and PR), and Table 20.
In addition, beginning with the release of 1Q22 data, IQVIA medical data moved from NDTI 
(National Disease and Therapeutic Index, used to capture data in the US) to NMTA (National 
Medical and Treatment Audit), used to capture data in the US and Puerto Rico. NMTA uses 
different methodologies for data, sample and projection compared to NDTI. Due to the 
change in methodology, it is observed a trend break in data for indication, formulation, 
region, gender, age and dose. As part of this update, the NMTA audit can only produce 
patient age information in 5-year age bands due to data privacy concerns for older age 
groups. The 5-year age bands do not align with the age breakdown for paediatric population 
according to ICH E11 (R1) recommendation. In this report, the demographic data for US and 
Puerto Rico are presented according to 5 years bands mimicking as close as possible ICH 
recommendation for the paediatric population (0-15; 16-20 years). There is no impact on 
elderly population aged >65 years.

SVII.1.1. Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP
A review of the safety data from the 3 completed Phase 3 trials of 20vPnC in adults 
(B7471006, B7471007, B7471008) did not identify any risks beyond those already known 
for 13vPnC/20vPnC and as such are not included in the list of safety concerns.
SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
Important Identified Risk: None
Important Potential Risk: None.
SVII.2. New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated 
RMP
There are no new important identified/potential risks for 20vPnC. Upon completion of the 
coadministration studies B7471004 and B7471026 and based upon review of the 
immunogenicity and safety results, the MAH no longer considers the concomitant use of 
20vPnC with quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) or COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
as missing information. (See also Module SVII.3.2).
B7471004 (quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine coadministration): 
Study Summary and Conclusion: A total of 1796 healthy adults â¥65 years of age were 
stratified by prior pneumococcal vaccine status (no previous pneumococcal vaccine [naÃ¯ve], 
receipt of at least 1 dose of PPSV23 only, receipt of at least 1 dose of 13vPnC only, or 
receipt of at least 1 dose each of PPSV23 and 13vPnC) and randomized in 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 
groups to receive 20vPnC concomitantly administered with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza 
Page 42
vaccine (QIV; surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) (Group 1, N = 898) or 20vPnC 
administered 1 month after receiving QIV (Group 2, N = 898). 1752 (97.6%) were 
vaccinated at Visit 2, and 1727 (96.2%) completed the study. The immune responses to all 20 
serotypes elicited by 20vPnC when coadministered with QIV were noninferior to those 
elicited by 20vPnC when administered 1 month after QIV. Of note, numerically lower titres 
were observed for all pneumococcal serotypes included in 20vPnC when given 
concomitantly with QIV compared to when 20vPnC was given alone. The clinical relevance 
of this finding is unknown. Immune responses to all 4 influenza strains elicited by QIV when 
coadministered with 20vPnC were noninferior to those elicited by QIV alone. 
20vPnC was observed to have a similar safety profile when coadministered with or 
administered 1 month after QIV. The results from this study and the consistency of findings 
with prior influenza vaccine studies, provide support for the general concept that 20vPnC 
may be administered with influenza vaccines in adults â¥18 years of age.
B7471026 (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine coadministration study) 
Study Summary and Conclusion: 20vPnC elicited robust immune responses to all 20 
serotypes 1 month after coadministration with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside 
modified) and when administered alone. A booster dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
elicited robust immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 1 month after coadministration with 
20vPnC and when administered alone. When 20vPnC was coadministered with COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine, the tolerability profile generally resembled that of the COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine administered alone. There were a few differences in the safety profile when 
compared to administration of 20vPnC alone: pyrexia (13.0%) and chills (26.5%) were 
reported as âvery commonâ with co administration. There was also one report of dizziness 
(0.5%) in the co-administration group. The safety and immunogenicity results from this study 
support coadministration of 20vPnC with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.
Of note, the following sections of the EU SmPC have been updated to reflect 
immunogenicity and safety outcomes of studies B7471004 and B7471026. 
ï· Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
of the EU SmPC has been updated to include the following: 
âPrevenar 20 may be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine 
(QIV; surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted). In subjects with underlying 
conditions associated with a high risk of developing life-threatening pneumococcal 
disease, consideration may be given to separating administrations of QIV and 
Prevenar 20 (e.g., by approximately 4 weeks). In a double-blind, randomised study 
(B7471004) in adults 65 years of age and older, the immune response was formally 
non-inferior, however numerically lower titres were observed for all pneumococcal 
serotypes included in Prevenar 20 when given concomitantly with seasonal influenza 
vaccine (QIV, surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) compared to when Prevenar 
20 was given alone. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.â
Page 43
âPrevenar 20 can be administered concomitantly with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
(nucleoside modified).â
ï· Section 4.8 Undesirable effects (Safety with concomitant vaccine administration in 
adults) of the EU SmPC states the following: 
âWhen Prevenar 20 was administered to adults aged â¥65 years together with the third 
(booster) dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified), the tolerability 
profile generally resembled that of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside 
modified) administered alone. There were a few differences in the safety profile when 
compared to administration of Prevenar 20 alone.  In the phase 3 trial B7471026 
(study 1026), pyrexia (13.0%) and chills (26.5%) were reported as âvery commonâ 
with co-administration.  There was also one report of dizziness (0.5%) in the co-
administration group.â
Additionally, the following information was added to the PL, Section 2, Other 
medicines/vaccines and Prevenar 20 to address the previously considered missing 
information âConcomitant use of 20vPnC with quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccineâ:
âPrevenar 20 may be given at the same time as the flu (inactivated influenza) vaccine 
at different injection sites. Depending on the individual risk assessment of your health 
care provider, separation of both vaccinations of e.g., 4 weeks might be advised.â
âPrevenar 20 can be given at the same time as the COVID-19 mRNA vaccineâ.
Interactions between 20vPnC and QIV, 20vPnC and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, as well as 
any other interaction(s) will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.

PART III. PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES)
III.1. Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Routine pharmacovigilance activities (PVAs) beyond adverse eventsâ reporting and signal 
detection:
ï· Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for safety concerns: 
There are no specific adverse event follow-up questionnaires addressing any of the safety 
concerns for this RMP. (Annex 4 contains no data).
ï· Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for safety concerns: 
Since licensure of 13vPnC, reports from the European countries Denmark, France, Germany, 
Norway, and UK were submitted annually to the EU Regulatory Authority as part of a post-
marketing commitment (MEA 19, previously FUM 19). On 26 June 2014, at the request of 
the CHMP, this MEA was closed while surveillance data continue to be reported in routine 
PSURs. Confidential reports from Denmark, France, Germany, UK, and, until recently, 
Norway, have continued to be included in the report post MEA 19 closure. This activity will 
also continue with 20vPnC. 
Data from the above surveillance systems will include information on serotype and antibiotic 
resistance, and often includes vaccination history, allowing for assessment of vaccine 
effectiveness or vaccine failure. 
Furthermore, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has 
established a European surveillance system for IPD that compiles reported cases from 29 EU 
member states. The surveillance data are available an online as an interactive database 
(ECDC Surveillance atlas) and allow for customized analysis of serotype distributions by 
country, year of reporting and age group (<1 year, 1 - 4 years, â¥65 years of age). A summary 
of the epidemiology of IPD reported by ECDC will be submitted together with the country 
reports mentioned above to the EU Regulatory Authority.
In addition, a targeted literature search will be conducted, with the objective to identify the 
most relevant and representative publications and publicly available surveillance data 
(ECDC, CDC, WHO data, as examples) to document epidemiology of pneumococcal 
disease. Large population- and hospital-based studies among European and North American 
adult populations are given priority over other types of studies and regions, with a focus on 
pneumococcal disease epidemiology, emerging resistance, and vaccine effectiveness. 
Relevant data will be reported in the routine PSURs.

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Prevenar 20 (20-valent Pneumococcal 
Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine [20vPnC])
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Prevenar 20. The RMP details 
important risks of Prevenar 20, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Prevenar 20âs risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Prevenar 20's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Prevenar 20 should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Prevenar 20 should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Prevenar 20's RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Prevenar 20 is a vaccine for:
ï· Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals â¥18 years of age (see SmPC for the full 
indication);
The proposed paediatric indication is:
ï· Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis 
media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children, and adolescents from 6 
weeks to less than 18 years of age.
Prevenar 20 contains pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (20-valent, adsorbed) 
as the active substance, and it is given by IM route of administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Prevenar 20âs benefits can be found in Prevenar 
20âs EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under 
the medicineâs webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Prevenar 
20.
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Prevenar 20, together with measures to minimise such risks and the
proposed studies for learning more about Prevenar 20's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
ï·
Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals
Page 52
ï·
Important advice on the medicineâs packaging
ï· The authorised pack size â the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly
ï· The medicineâs legal status â the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Prevenar 20 is not yet available, it is 
listed under âmissing informationâ below.
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Prevenar 20 are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Prevenar 20. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this vaccine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).
There are no important identified/potential risks or missing information for Prevenar 20.
II.B. Summary of Important Risks
Not applicable.
II.C. Post-Authorisation Development Plan
II.C.1. Studies which are Conditions of the Marketing Authorisation
The following post-authorisation efficacy studies are conditions of the marketing 
authorisation for Prevenar 20 in adults:
ï· Study B7471015: A Phase 4 Study Using a Test-Negative Design to Evaluate the 
Effectiveness of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Against Vaccine-
Type Radiologically Confirmed Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults â¥65
Years of Age
Purpose of the study: Evaluate the effectiveness of 20vPnC against vaccine-type 
radiologically confirmed community acquired pneumonia in adults â¥65 years of age.

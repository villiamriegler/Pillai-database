1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH submitted on 03 March 2023 an extension of the marketing authorisation. 
Extension application to add a new strength of 1.5/1.5 micrograms/dose for the Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 concentrate for dispersion for injection for infants and children between 6 months to 4 years of age. 
The MAH applied for an addition of a new strength 1.5/1.5 micrograms/dose. 
The MAH applied for the following indication for Comirnaty 1.5/1.5 micrograms/dose: 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in infants and children aged 6 
months to 4 years.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China and 
has rapidly spread around the world by human-to-human transmission. 
2.1.2.  Clinical presentation 
COVID-19 presentation is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing ground-glass 
opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or radiographic changes, and 
infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling transmission. For symptomatic patients, 
disease progression may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilation, subsequent multi-
organ failure, and death. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 6/105 
 
 
Common symptoms in hospitalized patients (in order of highest to lowest frequency) include fever, dry 
cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, nausea/vomiting or diarrhoea, headache, weakness, and 
rhinorrhoea. Anosmia (loss of smell) or ageusia (loss of taste) may be the sole presenting symptom in 
approximately 3% of individuals who have COVID-19. 
2.1.3.  Management 
Currently available therapies have different benefit-risk considerations depending on the stage of illness and 
disease manifestations. While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, 
vaccination is the most effective medical countermeasure to decrease risk and mitigate spread of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus.  
2.2.  About the product 
Given the genetic and resulting antigenic differences in currently circulating Omicron sublineages of SARS-
CoV-2 (eg, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.5, XBB.1, XBB.1.5) compared to the original strain, the MAH has added the 
bivalent variant-adapted vaccine to ensure adequate protection in children <5 years of age, as is currently 
authorized for booster doses in individuals ≥5 years of age. The protection provided by the original type-
based mRNA vaccines against Omicron-related infection appears to be lower and shorter-lived compared to 
that seen for prior variants. Vaccine effectiveness against severe disease associated with novel Omicron 
sublineages has waned even for severe disease among the general population with a booster dose. 
The bivalent COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine and the bivalent COMIRNATY Original/Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5 vaccine were approved in the EU for use in individuals ≥12 years of age who have received at 
least primary vaccination against COVID-19 on 01 September 2022 and 12 September 2022, respectively. On 
10 November 2022, the 10 μg dose of the bivalent COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccine was 
approved for use in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have received at least primary vaccination 
against COVID-19. The immunogenicity assessment of Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 was based on extrapolation of 
immunogenicity data from studies with Comirnaty Original and Original/Omi BA.1 and explorative non-clinical 
immunogenicity data for the Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The authorization of a 3-dose primary series of BNT162b2 3 µg in individuals 6 months to <5 years of age is 
based on clinical safety and immunogenicity data from approximately 4500 participants (including 
approximately 3000 participants who received BNT162b2 and 1500 who received placebo) 6 months to <5 
years of age with 1.3-to-1.4-month median duration of blinded follow-up in Study C4591007. Effectiveness of 
the 3-µg dose in the 6 months to <5 years of age group was inferred based on the successful protocol-
specified immunobridging analysis, which compared SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses in this age 
group in Study C4591007 to a group of young adult participants 16 to 25 years of age in the C4591001 
efficacy study. Protocol-specified efficacy analyses demonstrated >70% VE in this age group from at least 7 
days post-Dose 3 to the data cutoff date. 
Pfizer/BioNTech requested authorization of the 3 µg formulation of the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
Vaccine as a 3-dose primary series and booster (fourth dose) for use in infants and children 6 months to <5 
years of age based upon:

• 
Immunogenicity and safety data for a subset of participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in Group 2 
of Substudy B of Study C4591048 following administration of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 
3 µg as a booster (fourth dose). 
• 
Extrapolation of immunogenicity and safety data for participants ≥5 years to <12 years of age in 
Group 2 of Substudy D of Study C4591048 following administration of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) at 10 µg as a booster (fourth dose). 
Extrapolation of immunogenicity and safety data from participants in Cohort 2 (≥12 years of age) and 
• 
Cohort 3 (≥18 years of age) of Study C4591044 following administration of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) at 30 or 60 µg as a booster (fourth dose). 
• 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (original/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 3 µg specific CMC package. 
Thus, no data are available for primary vaccination with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5).  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Pfizer and BioNTech have developed the COMIRNATY vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-
19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein antigens 
encoded in RNA and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). 
There are several approved formulations of Comirnaty vaccine:

To assist in the public health crisis, a new Pediatric 3 μg BNT162b2 Bivalent [Original and Omicron 
(BA.4/BA.5) variant] finished product (herein referred to as Bivalent or 3 μg dose), consisting of the Original 
and Omicron (BA.4/BA.5) active substance strains (also referred to as active substance constructs), is being 
introduced. 
The purpose of this submission is to provide details on the Bivalent finished product 3 µg RNA dose 
presentation, which is filled at 0.4 mL per vial. The 3 µg RNA presentation requires dilution with 2.2 mL 0.9% 
sodium chloride prior to administration and once diluted provides 10 doses, each containing a 3 µg RNA dose 
in 0.2 mL injection volume. 
The Bivalent vaccine is manufactured using the two active substance RNA constructs in an approximately 1:1 
ratio The Bivalent finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in Tris buffer and sucrose. The platform 
manufacturing processes from the Original Tris-Sucrose and Bivalent finished product are used for the 
manufacture of 3 µg dose. Substantial supportive process and characterisation information is available for 
both the Original Tris-Sucrose and Bivalent finished products. From an active substance perspective, there 
are no changes to the manufacture, characterisation, control, container closure, or stability required on the 
basis of this change. Similarly, from a finished product perspective, there are no changes to finished product 
control of excipients or container closure on the basis of this change. The 3 μg dose finished product is 
identical to the 10 and 30 μg dose finished products, differing only in fill volume and dose specific 
requirements for dilution prior to administration. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substances tozinameran and famtozinameran are already approved for the original Comirnaty 
vaccine formulations (EU/1/20/1528/001-014). No changes to the information are proposed except for a 
minor and acceptable update in section 3.2.S.4.5. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2 . 4 . 3 . 1 .     Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original and Omicron (BA.4/BA.5) Variant) finished product, is supplied as a 
preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in aqueous cryoprotectant 
buffer for intramuscular administration.  
The Bivalent finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in Tris bufferand sucrose,and contains an 
approximately 1:1 ratio of the BNT162b2 Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 RNA constructs. There are three 
dosages of the Bivalent finished product – 30, 10, and 3 µg RNA per dose. The doses differ only in the fill 
volume and requirement for dilution prior to administration: 
- 
The Bivalent finished product 30 µg RNA dose is provided in either the multidose (MDV) presentation 
filled at 2.25 mL fill volume and is administered without dilution, providing 6 doses, each a 30 µg RNA 
dose in 0.3 mL injection volume or the 30 µg RNA dosage is provided in a single dose (SDV) 
presentation filled at 0.48 mL fill volume and administered without dilution, providing one 30 μg RNA 
dose in 0.3 mL injection volume. Each construct, BNT162b2 Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 is 
present in approximately equal quantities, i.e. 15 µg RNA each, totalling 30 µg RNA per dose.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 9/105 
 
 
- 
The Bivalent finished product 10 µg RNA dose is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 
1.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 µg RNA dose in 
0.2 mL injection volume. Each construct, BNT162b2 Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5, is present in 
approximately equal quantities, i.e. 5 µg RNA each, totalling 10 µg RNA per dose. 
- 
The Bivalent finished product 3 µg RNA dose is filled at 0.4 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 
2.2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 3 µg RNA dose in 
0.2 mL injection volume. Each construct, BNT162b2 Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5, is present in 
approximately equal quantities, i.e. 1.5 µg RNA each, totalling 3 µg RNA per dose. 
The section on description and composition of the finished product has been updated to include the 3 µg dose 
presentation of the bivalent vaccine compared to the already approved procedures 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 (10 µg dose presentation), EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 (3 µg dose presentation) 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0147 (10 µg, bivalent dose presentation including the original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 
strains) and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0143 (30 µg, bivalent dose presentation including the original and omicron 
BA.4/BA.5 strains). 
The composition of the bivalent finished product 3 µg RNA dose, including quality standard, function, 
concentration and amount per dose has been provided. 
The container closure system is a 2 mL Type I borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and is the same container closure system as for the already approved 
Tris/sucrose finished product of Comirnaty. 
The processing aids and active substance formulation buffer components are residues that are essentially 
removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered as ingredients (excipients). 
Pharmaceutical development 
The QTPP has been updated for the bivalent vaccine to include the bivalent 3 µg/dose presentation. No 
changes have been made compared to the QTPP for the original vaccine in Tris/Sucrose formulation except 
for a reflection of the use of two strains of mRNA, the inclusion of RNA ratio as a quality attribute and for the 
claimed shelf-life. 
No change in physicochemical properties, processability and stability is expected for the bivalent vaccine 
compared to the original vaccine in the Tris/Sucrose formulation. 
The sections on components of the finished product and manufacturing process development and 
characterization have been updated to include the bivalent 3 µg/dose presentation. 
Comparability has previously been convincingly demonstrated for a number of comparisons of Comirnaty 
finished product, such as between clinical and commercial scale original finished product, between various 
manufacturing sites, between the PBS/Sucrose finished product and Tris/Sucrose finished product, between 
the various dosage presentations (30 μg, 10 μg and 3 μg) as well as between the monovalent and bivalent 
vaccine finished product. Comparability has been demonstrated via comprehensive studies including both 
release testing and extended characterisation testing. Due to the application of the same formulation, 
manufacturing process, and the use of the same manufacturing sites as the original and authorised finished 
product, extensive prior experience is leveraged for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product and 
comparability previously convincingly proven and concluded. 
For the bivalent 3 µg/dose presentation of finished product, batch analysis data are provided for a large-scale 
confirmatory batch with a fill volume of 0.4 mL.

In conclusion, the information provided in the sections on Description and composition of the finished product 
and Pharmaceutical development is found sufficient and acceptable.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose is manufactured at manufacturing sites, and using 
the same platform process, as currently approved Comirnaty vaccines (Tris/Sucrose formulation) 
(EU/1/20/1528/002-014). The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously confirmed. 
The manufacturing process consists of four major manufacturing steps – LNP fabrication, bulk drug product 
formation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling. The manufacturing process is the same as for the bivalent 
BA.4-5 vaccine (15/15 micrograms)/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0143) and the bivalent BA.4 5 vaccine (5/5 
micrograms)/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/147) except for a different fill volume. The manufacturing process is 
sufficiently described, and suitable in-process controls (IPCs) are applied. 
No process validation is performed for the bivalent BA.4-5 vaccine (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose. This is found 
acceptable since this line extension is based on the currently approved bivalent vaccines (Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 micrograms)/dose and (5/5 micrograms)/dose as well as the monovalent 
Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dos. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specifications for the bivalent vaccine finished product include tests for tests for 
Appearance (Visual), Appearance (Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
Osmolality (Osmometry), LNP Size (Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP Polydispersity (Dynamic Light 
Scattering), RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence assay), RNA content (Fluorescence assay), RNA ratio (ddPCR), 
ALC-0315 content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), ALC-0159 content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), DSPC content 
(HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), Lipid 
identities (HPLC-CAD, HPLC-ELSD), Identity of encoded RNA sequence (ddPCR), Potency / in Vitro Expression 
(Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), 
Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and Container Closure Integrity (Dye incursion). 
The specifications for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product includes a comprehensive set of 
relevant tests along with corresponding acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria for release and stability 
testing for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product are the same as those for the already approved 
bivalent 10 μg/dose and bivalent 30 μg/dose vaccine finished products for all quality attributes tested, except 
for vial content (volume) which has different acceptance criteria.  
The proposed acceptance criteria for vial content (volume) for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product 
is identical to the original 3 μg/dose monovalent Tris/sucrose vaccine finished product. The vial content 
(volume) for Tris/Sucrose finished product was determined to ensure that each 0.4 mL filled vial can deliver 
up to ten 3 µg doses of 0.2 mL each, following the addition of 2.2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride. The provided 
justification for vial content (volume) of 0.4 fill volume is found acceptable. 
Since the acceptance criteria for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product are based on the currently 
approved bivalent as well as original Tris/Sucrose vaccine finished products for the majority of test attributes, 
these acceptance criteria for test attributes are considered as clinically qualified to ensure quality, efficacy 
and safety.

Batch data has been provided for a commercial scale confirmatory batch filled at 0.4 mL. The batch was 
manufactured at the commercial site for the bivalent vaccine finished product (30, 10 and 3 μg RNA/dose) at 
Pfizer, Puurs, BE. All results met the acceptance criteria at the time of release. In addition, stability studies 
have been initiated and are ongoing for the commercial scale batch. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Batch release data are provided for one commercial scale batch of the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished 
product and this batch has been placed on stability study at both long-term storage conditions (-90 to -60°C) 
and accelerated storage conditions (5 ± 3 °C). 
The claimed 18 months shelf-life is identical to the already approved shelf-life for the original vaccine finished 
product (Tris/Sucrose formulation) and is based on the results provided in several recently approved line 
extensions EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044 (30 μg/dose/2.25 mL fill volume), EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 (10 
μg/dose/1.3 mL fill volume), EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 (3 μg/dose/0.4 mL fill volume), 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0143 (bivalent 30 μg/dose/2.25 mL fill volume), EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0147 (bivalent 
10 μg/dose/2.25 mL fill volume) as well as from stability results for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished 
product provided in this specific line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0176. 
This approach to extrapolate the shelf-life from the already authorised vaccine finished products, including 
both monovalent and bivalent finished products, is found acceptable since comparability has been 
convincingly demonstrated for a number of various comparisons of Comirnaty finished product such as 
between clinical and commercial scale finished product, between various manufacturing sites, between the 
PBS/Sucrose and Tris/Sucrose finished product, between the various dosage presentations (30 μg, 10 μg and 
3 μg) as well as between the monovalent and bivalent vaccine finished product. Comparability has been 
demonstrated via comprehensive studies including both release testing and extended characterisation 
testing. Due to the application of the same formulation, manufacturing process, and the use of the same 
manufacturing sites as the original and authorized finished product, extensive prior experience is leveraged 
for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product and comparability previously convincingly proven and 
concluded. 
Therefore, it was concluded that the proposed shelf-life for the bivalent 3 μg/dose vaccine finished product of 
18 months when stored at the recommended storage temperature of -90 to -60°C, including a short-term 
storage at 2-8 °C for up to 10 weeks (within the 18 months shelf-life), as defined in SmPC Section 6.3, is 
acceptable.  
2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
Not applicable.  
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
The active substances (tozinameran and famtozinameran) are identical to that used for the currently 
approved Comirnaty vaccine formulations (EU/1/20/1528/001-014). Consequently, there are no changes to 
the active substance sections and full reference is made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, 
concentrate for dispersion for injection (EMEA/H/C/005735). Adequate testing for bioburden, endotoxins and 
sterility are also included at appropriate stages of the manufacturing process of the finished product.

Not applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This line extension application to register Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5, (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose, 
concentrate for dispersion for injection is recommended for approval from a quality point of view. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
New data for this application is limited to studies on the immune response in mice after a primary series with 
variant vaccines, including the bivalent Omicron BA4/BA5 vaccine. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The monovalent or bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant-modified vaccines were tested as a two dose primary 
series in naïve Balb/c mice and as a 3rd dose booster in BNT162b2-experienced Balb/c mice. Omicron BA.4 
and BA.5 sublineages contain the same spike sequence, therefore the vaccine is described as “BA.4/BA.5”. 
Five groups of 10 female Balb/c mice were immunized, bled and euthanized after either receiving 
immunizations either twice, at 0 and 21 days, in the primary series; or one month after the primary series 
completion, as a third dose booster. Blood was collected at baseline and at 7 days and 28 days after last 
immunization. At 28 days after last immunization, spleen and lymph nodes were also harvested to analyze 
the antibody response by a pseudovirus neutralization assay and B-cell and T-cell responses by flow 
cytometry. 
Naïve mice were immunized with a two-dose primary series of monovalent OMI BA.4/BA.5 vaccine, which 
elicited high neutralizing titers against Omicron sub-lineages BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 after two

doses, but reduced neutralization against the Wuhan pseudovirus and the Omicron BA.1 sub-lineage. The 
bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccine (combination of BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omicron BA.4/BA.5) elicited a 
greater breadth of neutralizing antibody responses against all variants and sub-lineages tested. 
Immunization of BNT162b2-experienced Balb/c mice with either the monovalent or bivalent BA.4/BA.5 
variant-modified vaccine as a third dose booster, one month after completion of the primary series, increased 
neutralizing antibody responses against the Wuhan reference, the Delta variant and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, 
BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineages. In the monovalent group, Wuhan, Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 
neutralizing titers increased by 2, 2, 17, and 45-fold, respectively, at 7 days post booster compared to 1 
month post BNT162b2 Dose 2. At 1 month post-third dose boost, the difference, as compared to 1 month 
post BNT162b2 Dose 2, was 4, 7, 36, and 94-fold for Wuhan, Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5, 
respectively. 
In the bivalent group, Wuhan, Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titers increased by 3, 3, 11, 
and 22-fold, respectively, 7 days post booster compared to 1 month post BNT162b2 Dose 2 and 3, 6, 17, and 
66-fold, respectively, 1 month post booster compared to 1 month post BNT162b2 Dose 2. A broad response 
against Omicron sub-lineages was achieved with both monovalent (BNT162b2 BA.4/BA.5) and bivalent 
(BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.4/BA.5) formulations. The monovalent BA.4/BA.5 formulation elicited slightly 
higher Omicron-specific neutralizing titers compared to the bivalent BA.4/BA.5 formulation. 
In BNT162b2-experienced mice, both monovalent and bivalent vaccines administered as a third dose booster 
elicited a high frequency of total spike-specific B cells against any variant or sublineage with the greatest 
proportion of the response to Omicron BA.4-antigen. Slightly more cross-reactive B cells were observed with 
the bivalent BNT162b2+Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccine compared to the monovalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
vaccine. Both monovalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and bivalent BNT162b2+Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccines induced 
predominantly Omicron BA.4 strain-specific Spike+ B cells compared to a low frequency of WT or Omicron 
BA.1 Spike+ B cells. 
The magnitude of spike-specific T-cell responses induced by both monovalent and bivalent vaccines was 
similar. Notably, the magnitude of the T-cell response did not change based on the peptide pool (WT vs 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5), confirming that the variant- and sub-lineage specific mutations have minimal impact on 
the polyclonal T-cell response. 
Overall, two doses of the monovalent BA.4/BA.5 variant-modified vaccine elicited strong neutralizing antibody 
responses against Omicron BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineages but reduced neutralizing activity 
against the Wuhan and BA.1. The bivalent formulation induced a broader immune response against all strains 
tested. In BNT162b2 experienced mice, BA.4/BA.5 variant-modified vaccines induced robust and broad 
neutralizing antibody responses against the Wuhan reference and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12, and 
BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineages as well as a strong spike-specific B-cell and T-cell response when administered as a 
third dose booster. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
There are no new pharmacokinetics studies for this application. The pharmacokinetics program supporting 
the original MAA for BNT162b2 is fully supporting the current extension application.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
There are no new toxicology studies for this application. The toxicology program supporting the original MAA 
for BNT162b2 is fully supporting the current extension application. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 Corr 2), due to their nature, vaccines and lipids are unlikely to result 
in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, an environmental risk assessment is not provided in this 
Application. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support the use of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA4/BA5 variant vaccine, the MAH has provided data 
from studies in mice. Compared to the original vaccine, the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccine (combination 
of BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omicron BA.4/BA.5) elicited a greater breadth of neutralizing antibody 
responses against all variants and sub-lineages tested. 
The magnitude and specificity of the T-cell response was similar with monovalent and bivalent vaccines. 
Since the selection of B-cell repertoire activated by the vaccine is likely to be similar between mice and 
humans, these data are considered supportive for the use of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA4/BA5 vaccine 
for a primary vaccination. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The data from studies in mice with the Original/Omicron BA4/BA5 bivalent vaccine are considered supportive 
for the use of this vaccine for primary vaccination.

Title: A Master Phase 1/2/3 Protocol to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity 
of Bivalent BNT162b2 RNA-Based Vaccine Candidate in Healthy Children 
This study includes evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of third and fourth dose with 
the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) vaccine in individuals ≥6 months to <4 years and 6 months 
(Group 1) and fourth dose with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) vaccine in ≥6 months to <5 
years of age (Group 2 and Group 3 [safety only]). 
This report presents 1-month post dose descriptive immunogenicity data, as of the data cut-off date of 25 
November 2022, for a subset of 60 participants in Group 2 of C4591048 Substudy B (the first 24 and 36 
participants enrolled in ≥6 months to <2 years age group and ≥2 years to <5 years age group, respectively) 
who received a fourth dose with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at the 3 μg dose level after 
receiving 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 at 3 μg.  
Results include also data, as of the data cut-off date of 07 August 2022, from a comparator subset of 60 
participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age (24 and 36 participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 
years to <5 years of age, respectively) in Study C4591007 who received 3 doses of BNT162b2 at 3 μg.

Secondary immunogenicity: 
• 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4-5 and Reference strain neutralizing titers (GMT) 
•  Sample size 
Approximately 300 participants in Group 2, ≥6 months to <5 years of age, who have received 3 prior doses 
of BNT162b2 at 3 μg, with their last dose 60 to 240 days prior to enrolment, will receive 1 dose (fourth) of 
the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 3 μg.  
For the final immunogenicity assessment, a subset of approximately 240 participants will be selected from 
300 participants in Group 2 who received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 3 μg and a fourth dose of bivalent 
BNT162b2, and approximately 240 participants will be selected from participants receiving 3 doses of 
BNT162b2 3 μg from the C4591007 study. Assuming a 25% non-evaluable rate, approximately 180 evaluable 
participants in each arm will contribute to the immunogenicity evaluation. Each hypothesis test will be 
performed at a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 as described in Statistical Methods. 
In current analysis, the immunogenicity of bivalent vaccine in 60 subjects 6m-5yoa is descriptive and no 
hypothesis testing will be performed. 
•  Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Substudy B is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a third or fourth 
dose with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 3 μg. 
Enrolment of Group 2 will be stratified by age, such that approximately 30% of participants will be ≥6 
months to <2 years of age and approximately 70% of participants will be ≥2 years to <5 years of age. 
•  Statistical methods 
Descriptive immunogenicity analyses were performed to characterize Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and reference strain 
neutralization responses following a fourth dose with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) or 3 
doses of BNT162b2 each at 3 μg. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was used to determine Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5- and reference strain-specific neutralizing titers.  
GMTs and GMFRs with 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titers 
and fold rises, respectively, and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results 
below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ. 
Seroresponse was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the first study vaccination [fourth 
dose]) for participants. If the baseline measurement was below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 
× LLOQ was considered seroresponse. The exact 2-sided 95% CIs for percentages of participants with 
seroresponse was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.

The amendment 2 targeted Substudy C. Protocol amendment 1 is in response to the FDA feedback received 
on 23 Sep 2022. This feedback requested changes to generate more data on the bivalent vaccine. The 
substudy B was amended by increased sample size, updated and added objectives, estimands and endpoints 
to study superiority of the bivalent vaccine compared to the original vaccine in sense of inducing immune 
response against Omicron BA.4-5 strain and induction of non-inferior level of antibodies against reference 
strain.

Participants without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of infection, the GMTs against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group (prevaccination, 86.6; post dose, 1146.6) compared with that in the 
BNT162b2 group (prevaccination, 37.5; post dose, 401.3) at prevaccination and more substantially at 1-
month post dose (Table 3). Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 to <5 years of age, a 
similar trend as above was observed (Table 2). 
Participants with or without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection, the GMTs at prevaccination and 1-month post dose were higher in participants

who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (baseline positive) compared with those without evidence of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (baseline negative) in both vaccine groups (Table 2). 
Within both baseline positive and baseline negative groups, the GMTs against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant 
were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with that in the BNT162b2 
group at prevaccination and more substantially at 1-month post dose (Table 3). The similar trend was also 
observed among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 to <5 years of age (Table 2). 
Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of infection, the GMTs against the reference strain were higher at prevaccination and similar at 1-
month post dose in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group (prevaccination, 2090.1 and post 
dose, 9253.1) compared with that in the BNT162b2 group (prevaccination, 412.6 and post dose, 8341.2) 
(Table 2). The similar trend was also observed among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 to 
<5 years of age (Table 2). 
Participants with or without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection, similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTS, reference strain GMTs at 
prevaccination and 1-month post dose were higher in participants who were baseline positive compared with 
those who were baseline negative in both vaccine groups (Table 2). 
Within both the baseline positive and negative groups, the observed GMTs against the reference strain were 
higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with that in the BNT162b2 group at 
prevaccination (Table 2). At 1-month post dose, the observed GMTs were lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with that in the BNT162b2 group within the baseline positive group; 
within the baseline negative group, the observed GMTs were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) and the BNT162b2 groups. 
A similar trend was also observed within the baseline positive and baseline negative groups among 
participants ≥2 to <5 years of age and within the baseline negative group among participants ≥6 months to 
<2 years of age (Table 2). 
Within the baseline positive group among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age, the GMTs against the 
reference strain were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups at 
prevaccination (Table 2). At 1-month post dose, the trend was similar to that observed within baseline 
positive groups among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age and ≥2 to <5 years of age discussed 
above.

Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group (13.6 [95% CI: 8.4, 21.9]) compared with that in the BNT162b2 group (10.7 
[95% CI: 7.3, 15.8]) at 1-month post dose (Table 3). 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 to <5 years of age, a similar trend as above was 
observed (Table 3).

Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection, the GMFRs at 1-month post dose were lower in participants who were baseline 
positive compared with those who were baseline negative in both vaccine groups (Table 3 
Within baseline positive and baseline negative groups, the GMFRs were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 
Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 and BNT162b2 groups at 1-month post dose (Table 3). 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age, the GMFRs were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 
Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 and BNT162b2 groups at 1-month post dose within the baseline positive group; 
within the baseline negative group, the observed GMFRs were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) group compared with that in the BNT162b2 group (Table 3). Among participants ≥2 to <5 years 
of age, the observed GMFRs were lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 compared with the 
BNT162b2 group at 1-month post dose within the baseline positive group; within the baseline negative 
group, the GMFRs were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups. 
Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants without evidence of infection  
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of infection, for the reference strain, the GMFRs were lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5 group (4.4 [95% CI: 3.1, 6.3]) compared with that in the BNT162b2 group (19.8 [95% CI: 13.4, 
29.2]) at 1-month post dose (Table 3). The lower GMFRs in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 
group were likely due to the much higher prevaccination titers in this group compared with the BNT162b2 
group. 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 to <5 years of age, a similar trend as above was 
observed (Table 3). 
Participants with or without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection, the GMFRs at 1-month post dose were lower in participants who were baseline 
positive compared with those who were baseline negative in both vaccine groups (Table 3). 
At 1-month post dose, within the baseline positive group, the observed GMFRs were slightly lower in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 compared with that in the BNT162b2 group (Table 3). A similar 
trend was also observed in participants ≥2 to 5 years of age. For participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age, 
the GMFRs were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 and BNT162b2 groups. 
Within the baseline negative group, among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age, the GMFRs were 
lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group compared with that in the BNT162b2 group

Seroresponse rates 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Neutralization 
Participants without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of infection, 27 (77.1%) participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and 
21 (61.8%) participants in the BNT162b2 group achieved seroresponse against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
variant at 1-month post dose (Table 6). 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age, 9 (81.8%) and 6 (46.2%) participants in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and the BNT162b2 group, respectively, achieved seroresponse 
against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant. A total of 18 (75.0%) and 15 (71.4%) participants ≥2 to <5 years of 
age in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and the BNT162b2 group, respectively, achieved 
seroresponse against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant. 
Participants with or without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection, within the baseline positive group, 9 (56.3%) participants in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and 9 (60.0%) participants in the BNT162b2 group achieved 
seroresponse against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant at 1-month post dose (Table 4). Within the baseline 
negative group, 29 (76.3%) and 23 (63.9%) participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
group and BNT162b2 group, respectively, achieved seroresponse. 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and those ≥2 to <5 years of age, the percentages of 
participants who achieved seroresponse are provided in Table 4. 
Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of infection, 20 (52.6%) participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and 
29 (90.6%) participants in the BNT162b2 group achieved seroresponse against the reference strain at 1-
month post dose (Table 6). The lower percentage of participants achieving seroresponse in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group was likely a reflection of the higher prevaccination titers in this 
group compared with the BNT162b2 group. 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age, 6 (50.0%) and 11 (91.7%) participants in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and the BNT162b2 group, respectively, achieved seroresponse 
against the reference strain. A total of 14 (53.8%) and 18 (90.0%) participants ≥2 to <5 years of age in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group and the BNT162b2 group, respectively, achieved 
seroresponse against the reference strain (Table 4). 
Participants with or without evidence of infection 
Among participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection, the percentages of participants who achieved seroresponse were lower in the 
baseline positive group compared with those in the baseline negative group in both vaccine groups (Table 
4). 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

Within the baseline positive group, 3 (18.8%) participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 
group and 5 (33.3%) participants in the BNT162b2 group achieved seroresponse against the reference strain 
at 1-month post dose (Table 4). Within the baseline negative group, 22 (53.7%) and 31 (91.2%) 
participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group and BNT162b2 group, respectively, 
achieved seroresponse. The lower percentage of participants achieving seroresponse in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5 group was likely a reflection of the higher prevaccination titers in this 
group compared with the BNT162b2 group. 
Among participants ≥6 months to <2 years of age and those ≥2 to <5 years of age, the percentages of 
participants who achieved seroresponse are provided in Table 4.

•  Ancillary analyses 
Neutralization of Omicron sublineages 
The MAH submitted additionally 1-month postdose immunogenicity data for Omicron sublineages XBB.1.5, 
BQ.1.1, and BA.4/BA.5 in a subset of 31 participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in Group 2 of C4591048 
Substudy B who received a fourth dose with 3 μg of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) vaccine 
and a comparator subset of 31 participants in Study C4591007 Phase 2/3 who received 3 doses at 3 μg each 
of original BNT162b2. 
Selection of participants for additional neutralization testing 
Participants in these analyses were among the first 60 assigned participants in C4591048 Substudy B Group 
2 and the corresponding comparator group of 60 participants (subset from C4591007 Phase 2/3) who had 
sufficient sample volume remaining for the additional neutralization testing. 
The participants in the comparator group were matched by age, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status (before 
Dose 4 for participants in C4591048 Substudy B and before Dose 3 for participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3), 
and dosing interval (between Dose 3 and Dose 4 for participants in C4591048 Substudy B and between Dose 
2 and Dose 3 for participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3) with this subset of participants in C4591048 Substudy 
B. Participants in C4591048 Substudy B Group 2 received Dose 4 (booster) with bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) in September-October 2022 and participants in the comparator group from 
C4591007 Phase 2/3 received Dose 3 of original BNT162b2 in February-July 2022. 
Immunogenicity Endpoints and Analysis Methods 
Descriptive immunogenicity analyses were performed to characterize Omicron XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, and 
BA.4/BA.5 neutralization responses following a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
3 μg or following 3 doses at 3 μg each of original BNT162b2. A non-validated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 
FFRNT was used to determine Omicron XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, and BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titers. 
GMTs and GMFRs with 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titers 
and fold rises, respectively, and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results 
below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ. 
Seroresponse was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the first study vaccination [fourth 
dose]). If the baseline measurement was below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ was 
considered seroresponse.

prevaccination GMTs in the control group, further understanding of the sensitivity of N-binding to 
detect prior infection in children who overall have more asymptomatic infection and less severe 
disease compared with adults may need to be further explored. 
These descriptive data align with the adult data and reinforce the importance of a bivalent booster dose in 
this age group. 
MAH immunogenicity conclusions for Omicron sublineage XBB.1.5 and BQ.1.1 neutralization 
At 1-month postdose, a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 3 μg in a subset of 
participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age in the C4591048 Substudy B Group 2 who received 3 prior doses 
of original BNT162b2 at 3 μg each elicited lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 
compared with Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titers. 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as  well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

2.6.2.3.1.  Study C4591048, substudy D 
Substudy D is a Phase 3 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a third 
or fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 10 µg in approximately 250 participants. 
The protocol planned for enrolment of approximately 200 participants ≥5 to <12 years of age, who have 
received 2 or 3 prior doses of Original BNT162b2 10 µg, with their last dose 90 to 240 days prior to 
enrolment, that were offered a third or fourth dose of bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 10-µg. 
This would include 100 participants who have completed 2 prior doses of original BNT162b2 10-µg and up to 
100 participants who have completed 3 prior doses of original BNT162b2 10-µg. 
Up to approximately 50 participants ≥5 to <12 years of age, who have completed 3 prior doses of original 
BNT162b2 at least 90 days prior to enrolment, were enrolled from Study C4591007 Phase 1 and offered a 
fourth dose of bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 10-µg. 
This report for Substudy D presents the following 1-month postdose data for approximately 100 
participants ≥5 to <12 years of age from C4591048 Substudy D (Group 2) as of 25 NOV 2022 and

Descriptive immunogenicity analyses were performed to characterize Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and reference strain 
neutralization responses following a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
(C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 participants) or after 3 doses of BNT162b2 (C4591007 Phase 2/3 
Participants) each at 10 µg. The validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was used to determine Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5- and reference strain-specific neutralizing titers. 
GMTs and GMFRs with 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of 
the tiers and fold rises, respectively, and the corresponding CIs (based on Student t distribution). 
Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ. 
GMR and associated 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference in LS means and the 
corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed assay results using a linear 
regression model that includes the baseline neutralizing titer, postbaseline infection status, and vaccine 
group as covariates. 
Unadjusted GMR was calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay 
results and exponentiating the mean. Two-sided CIs were obtained by calculating CIs using the Student 
t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and 
exponentiating the confidence limits. 
Seroresponse was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination 
[fourth dose If the baseline measurement was below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 × 
LLOQ was considered seroresponse.  
The adjusted difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse, and the associated 2-sided 
95% CIs, were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline neutralizing 
titer category (<median, ≥median). The unadjusted difference in percentages of participants with 
seroresponse and the associated 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen 
method. 
•  Immunogenicity Population 
A total of 115 participants ≥5 to <12 years of age were assigned to receive a fourth dose with the bivalent 
BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg (Table 9).

participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group were baseline positive at the 
time of study vaccination (Dose 4). Median time since last dose of BNT162b2 before study vaccination 
(Dose 4) was 5.5 months in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group. In the BNT162b2 
group, 58.4% of participants were baseline positive prior to Dose 3. Median time between Dose 2 and 
Dose 3 of BNT162b2 was 6.5 months in the BNT162b2 group. 
Demographic characteristics for participants without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination in the evaluable immunogenicity population and the all-available immunogenicity population 
with or without evidence of infection were generally similar.

GMT 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of prior infection, for both vaccine 
groups, GMTs against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant were higher at predose and at 1-month postdose in 
participants who were baseline positive compared with those who were baseline negative (Table 13). 
Within both baseline positive and baseline negative groups, BA.4/BA.5-neutralizing GMTs were higher in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with that in the BNT162b2 group at 
prevaccination. For baseline positive participants, BA.4/BA.5- neutralizing GMTs at 1month postdose were 
higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the BNT162b2 group. For 
baseline negative participants, the observed GMTs at 1-month postdose were generally similar in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups, despite lower prevaccination values in the 
BNT162b2 group. The results are not as good as observed in previous studies for the bivalent group relative 
to the original vaccine group, especially for baseline negative participants. Lack of randomization (which 
results in substantial prevaccination titer differences between groups and potential imbalance in some 
participants characteristics) makes it very difficult to interpret the results. 
GMTs across both sexes were similar within both vaccine groups.

Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of prior infection, for both vaccine 
groups, the observed reference strain GMTs were higher at predose and generally similar or higher at 1 
month postdose in participants who were baseline positive compared with those who were baseline negative 
(Table 16). 
Within both baseline positive and baseline negative groups, the observed reference strain- neutralizing GMTs 
were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with that in the BNT162b2 group 
at prevaccination. For baseline positive participants, at 1-month postdose, the observed reference strain-
neutralizing GMTs were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the 
BNT162b2 group. For baseline negative participants, reference strain-specific neutralizing GMTs were 
generally similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups. 
GMTs across both sexes were similar within both vaccine groups. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection, the observed reference 
strain-neutralizing GMTs at pre-vaccination were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the BNT162b2 group. 
At 1-month postdose, the observed GMTs were generally similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi

MAH discussion of immunogenicity results for C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 (5y-
<12 yoa) 
At 1-month postdose, a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg in 
participants ≥5 years to <12 years of age in the C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 who received 3 prior 
doses of original BNT162b2 at 10 μg indicated a robust immune response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5. 
The immune response elicited by bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) were generally similar 
for Omicron BA.4/BA.5- and reference strain-specific neutralizing titers and percentage of participants 
with seroresponse to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 compared with C4591007 Phase 2/3 participants of the same 
age who received 3 doses of original BNT162b2.  
The magnitude of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 immune response after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 is unexpected 
and may be related to natural exposure and dose interval. As this analysis did not compare 2 
contemporaneous randomized groups, there may have been an imbalance between the 2 groups in 
some measurable or nonmeasurable factors, such as those described below. This imbalance may have 
contributed to the unexpected results. Participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3 received the third dose in 
March-April 2022, shortly after the Omicron BA.1 wave. 
Whilst not reflected in the N-binding antibody responses, this may have resulted in a significant level of 
natural exposure to Omicron BA.1; thereby, potentially augmenting the response to Dose 3 of 
BNT162b2. The prevaccination GMTs also may have influenced the magnitude of the response to the 
booster dose (either Dose 3 or Dose 4), as they were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) group than in the comparator group. In addition, this difference may be due to the shorter 
interval between Dose 3 and Dose 4 in the BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group (5.5 months, 
range 3.5-8.5 months) compared with the dose interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 in the BNT162b2 
group (6.5 months, range 6.3-7.6 months). However, it may be more likely due to participants in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group receiving the fourth dose in September- October 
2022. Hence, these participants had a 6-month longer period of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 
during the waves of multiple Omicron sublineages in 2022. The higher prevaccination GMTs were 
reflected in the lower GMFRs and seroresponse rates in participants who received a fourth dose with the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3 who 
received 3 doses of original BNT162b2. 
2.6.2.3.2.  Study C4591044 
Study C4591044 is a randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of new bivalent vaccines. The study participants are divided into cohorts, which may be 
studied in a staggered or parallel manner. Cohorts 2 and 3 in the study consist of participants ≥12 years of 
age who received 3 doses of BNT162b2, each at 30 µg, prior to receiving a booster (fourth dose) with 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at the 30- or 60-µg dose level. The groups within each cohort and 
the dose level of the study vaccine are defined in Table 16. The MAH has provided 1-month post dose (four) 
immunogenicity data for the participants.

Immunogenicity results 
GMT 
Analysis of immunogenicity data at 1 month after study vaccination in the evaluable immunogenicity 
population with or without evidence of infection for BNT162b2- experienced participants showed that 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 µg and 60 µg dose elicited robust immune response against 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in all age groups and the response was higher than the corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMTs at prevaccination and 1 month after study vaccination were higher in participants 
who were baseline positive compared with those were baseline negative in all age and vaccine groups. 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMTs were: 
• 
Higher in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 
µg compared with other age and vaccine groups at both prevaccination and 1 month after vaccination. 
• 
Larger increase from prevaccination in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg and 60-µg groups compared with participants in the 
corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. The differences between BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) groups and BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) were more substantial in the baseline 
negative groups. 
• 
Generally similar in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age who received BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at either dose. 
• 
Higher overall in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 60-µg group compared with that in the 
30-µg group. 
• 
Generally similar across both sexes within each age and dose group.

GMFR 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMFRs at 1 month after study 
vaccination were: 
• 
Similar in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 
µg group compared with other age and vaccine groups at 1 month after vaccination. 
• 
Higher in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) 30- and 60 µg groups compared with participants in the corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. The differences between BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) groups and 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) were more substantial in the baseline negative groups. 
• 
Generally similar in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age who received BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at either dose. 
• 
• 
Generally similar between the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30- and 60-µg groups. 
Generally similar across both sexes within each age and dose group.

Seroresponse 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 seroresponse rates at 1 month after 
study vaccination were: 
• 
Similar in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 
µg compared with other age and vaccine groups. 
•  Similar or higher in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg and 60-µg groups compared with the corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.1) age and dose groups. The higher seroresponse rates in the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) groups than the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) groups were more 
prominent in the baseline negative groups and the >55 years of age groups. 
Generally similar between the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30- and 60-µg groups. 
Generally similar across both sexes within each age and dose group.

Overall, immune responses against Omicron BA.1 and the reference strain were comparable for both bivalent 
vaccines in baseline positive participants, and a trend of higher increases for baseline negative participants 
was observed in participants who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5). Variability in the 
immune responses were observed for participants in the 2 age groups who received BNT162b2 Bivalent

(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) and could relate to smaller number of participants in each group. There is also an 
increasingly heterogeneous population regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection history and the specific variant 
responsible for the prior infection(s), which can influence the degree of pre-existing immunity to a given 
variant. These and additional unmeasured factors may, in part, have contributed to the variable patterns 
observed across the age groups or vaccine groups for Omicron BA.1 and reference strain-neutralizing titers. 
Increased neutralizing responses with BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.1) were observed regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2 infection status, with the greatest GMFRs 
observed in participants without prior infection and the higher neutralizing titers observed in participants with 
prior infection. 
An additional immunogenicity analysis of a subset of BNT162b2-experienced adults 18 through 55 and >55 
years of age in C4591044 Cohort 2 who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μg compared 
with BNT162b2-experienced adults >55 years of age in C4591031 Substudy E who received BNT162b2 30 μg 
as a booster (fourth) dose was performed. Substantially higher Omicron BA.4/BA.5-specific neutralization 
titers and higher reference-strain neutralization titers 1 month after study vaccination were reported for 
participants in both age groups who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μg compared with 
an adult comparator group from C4591031 Substudy E (>55 years of age) who received a booster dose of 
BNT162b2 at the 30-μg dose level. 
In a separate analysis of a subset of the Cohort 2 immunogenicity population who received BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg, the vaccine elicited consistently higher Omicron BA.4.6-, BA.2.75.2-, 
BQ.1.1-, and XBB-specific neutralization titers at 1 month post-vaccination in participants >55 years of age 
compared with an adult comparator group (>55 years of age) from C4591031 Substudy E who received a 
booster dose of BNT162b2 at the 30-μg dose level. Immune responses against Omicron XBB variant were 
more limited compared with the other sublineages.

These results suggest an anticipated improved clinical benefit against COVID-19 due to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 
with BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) compared with BNT162b2 as a booster (fourth dose). 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application concerns the extension of indication of the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to add a new 
strength (1.5/1.5 µg) as a primary series (3 doses) and a booster dose for children 6 months up to less than 
5 years of age. 
Comirnaty Original 3 µg has been approved since October 2022 for this age group. The approval of the 
Original 3 µg vaccine was based on data from a randomized, observer blinded placebo-controlled trial. The VE 
after 3 doses in age group 6 m -<5y was 80.3 % (95% CI 13.9, 96.7). The MAH has not applied for a booster 
indication for Original Comirnaty 3 µg for 6m-<5y. 
Antibodies elicited by the Original strain vaccine provide lower and short-lived protection against the Omicron 
strains as randomized clinical trials and observational data from all over the world have indicated. In 
response to the waning protection, the MAH updated the COVID-19 vaccine to a bivalent formulation to 
include both the Reference and Omicron strains. The first bivalent formulation Original/Omicron BA.1 15/15 
µg received a booster indication for individuals 12 years and older in September 2022. The immunogenicity 
was evaluated in subjects older than 55 years, where approximately 230 individuals in each study arm 
received either Original, monovalent or bivalent vaccine including Omicron BA.1 as 4th dose. Superiority of 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 µg) was demonstrated over Original (30 µg) in sense of antibody titer against

BA.1 (GMR 1.56, 95% CI 1.17, 2.08), whereas the level of anti- reference strain antibodies did not differ 
between study arms. 
The bivalent formulation including Omicron BA.4-5 strain received a booster indication for age groups 12 and 
older (15/15 µg) and for 5 to <12 years old (5/5 µg) later in autumn 2022. There were no clinical 
immunogenicity data available at the time of approval. Instead, the efficacy and immunogenicity were 
extrapolated from studies with the bivalent vaccine Original/Omicron BA.1 and with Original Comirnaty. 
Currently submitted data comes from studies investigating Original /Omicron BA 4-5 as a fourth dose after 3 
doses of Original Comirnaty. No data from primary series with the bivalent vaccine has been submitted. The 
MAH has shown earlier plans to investigate a primary series in the youngest age group, the study is ongoing. 
Age group 6m-<5y. Pivotal data. 
No dose-response study has been presented for the Original /Omicron BA 4-5 (1.5/1.5 µg) vaccine. The 
lowest dose in the Original vaccine study was 3 µg and the MAH does not currently have immunogenicity data 
from a primary series with the bivalent vaccine. Although there is no immunogenicity data of 1.5 µg mRNA, 
as the total amount in the bivalent vaccine are 3 µg, the immunogenicity is considered to be at the same 
level as for the Original Comirnaty 3 µg.  
The MAH complemented that the C4591048 substudy A which investigates the immunogenicity of a primary 
series of Original /Omicron BA 4-5 (1.5/1.5 µg) is ongoing and as of 01 Jun 2023, Substudy A Phase 1 has 
completed enrolment in the 6 months to <2 years cohort (target n = 90) and has reached 75% (64 out of 
90) of the enrolment target in the 2 to <5-year-old group. The MAH has committed to submit this data as 
soon as available. 
Substudy B of C4591048 is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 
third or fourth dose with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4-5) at 3 μg (1.5/1.5 μg). As there is no 
placebo arm in the study and no efficacy will be evaluated, the open-label format is acceptable. 
Approximately 300 participants in Group 2, ≥6 months to <5 years of age, who have received 3 prior doses of 
BNT162b2 3 μg, with their last dose 60 to 240 days prior to enrolment, will receive 1 dose (fourth) of 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4-5) 3 μg. The study is powered for superiority and non-inferiority 
evaluation, this data will be submitted later when the study is finalized, the interim CSR with safety and 
immunogenicity for the entire Subgroup B (N = 300) is targeted for end of June 2023. 
In the current report a 1-month post dose descriptive immunogenicity data is presented for a subset of 60 
participants in Group 2 of C4591048 Substudy B (the first 24 and 36 participants enrolled in ≥6 months to <2 
years age group and ≥2 years to <5 years age group, respectively). Results include also data from a 
comparator subset of 60 participants ≥6 months to <5 years of age (24 and 36 participants ≥6 months to <2 
years of age and ≥2 years to <5 years of age, respectively) in Study C4591007 who received 3 doses of 
BNT162b2 at 3 μg. The sample size presented currently comprise 60 individuals but as the data are 
descriptive and a larger cohort will be analysed later, the current sample size is acceptable. The time since 
last dose was 2-8 months. About 70 % of subjects had no history of previous COVID-19. Data for the same 
number of doses was presented for adults (supportive studies).  
The baseline antibody level against the reference strain was higher in the group allocated to receive a 4th dose 
than in the group receiving a third dose. In the COVID-19 negative group, baseline anti-reference strain 
antibody level was more than four-fold higher in the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 than in the Original. 
After the booster dose, the anti-reference strain antibodies were in comparable level in all groups 
independent of the baseline COVID-19 status, antibody level at the baseline or number of earlier doses.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 78/105 
 
 
At baseline COVID-19 negative groups, the anti-Omicron BA 4-5 levels were low in both bivalent 4th dose and 
Original as 3rd dose groups, however GMTs were almost three-fold higher in the bivalent group compared to 
the original group. GMFR was approximately 14 for bivalent group and for the Original group, 11.  
Additionally, in a small subset (N= 31 in each arm) the neutralization against new circulating COVID-19 
strains was evaluated using an unvalidated FFRNT assay. The results showed low antibody titers against 
these new strains both after 3 doses of Original and after the 4th dose of bivalent vaccine. After the 4th dose 
with bivalent, the antibodies were higher than after 3rd dose with Original, but still remained modest in 
comparison to the GMTs against targeted strains. The clinical benefit for these modestly higher antibodies is 
unknown. 
In summary, the Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 μg) vaccine given as a 4th dose is immunogenic in 
children 6m-<5 y who have previously received 3 doses of Original 3 μg. There are currently no data on 
primary vaccination with the bivalent vaccine in any age group although such data are expected. The 
assumption that the bivalent vaccine will provide sufficient protection when given as a primary vaccination is 
extrapolated from the demonstrated immunogenicity of the booster dose.  
Age group 5-11 years. Supportive data. 
Substudy D of C4591048 is a Phase 3 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of a third or fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4-5) 5/5 µg in 
approximately 250 participants at ages ≥5 - <12 years, who were previously vaccinated with Original. As in 
Substudy B, the immunogenicity is compared to a cohort which has received 3 doses of Original 10 µg. No 
data from primary series from this cohort vaccinated with Original/Omi BA.4-5 (5/5 µg) are available. 
The immunogenicity population included approximately 100 individuals in each study arm. This sample size 
suffices for descriptive immunogenicity analysis. About 60 % of the study population had COVID-19 earlier. 
The primary endpoint was descriptive GMR of GMTs in the 4th dose bivalent arm and comparison arm with 3 
doses of Original only. The MAH used a Model Based Geometric Mean Ratio calculation and explained the 
methodology behind the GMR calculation. The model based result showed no substantial difference between 
the 4th dose bivalent arm and 3rd dose Original arm (GMR 1.2 (95% CI 0.92, 1.37)) as the model based 
Omicron BA.4-5 GMTs were very similar (1836 vs. 1633 respectively). The seroresponse rate to omicron 
BA.4/5 was also almost identical.  
These data show that Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (5/5 μg) is immunogenic as 4th dose in children 5y-<12 y who 
have previously received 3 doses of Original 10 μg. It is anticipated that this vaccine is immunogenic also as 
a primary series as half of the amount of mRNA is the same as in the approved Original vaccine and the 
Omicron BA.4-5 component has been demonstrating immunogenicity as a booster dose.  
Age group >12 years. Supportive data. 
Study C4591044 is a randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of new bivalent variant vaccines in different age groups: 12-17, 18-55 and >55. The study is 
divided into cohorts. Immunogenicity in some cohorts was studied only descriptively (Cohort 2), whereas 
some groups from Cohorts 2 and 3 together were analysed for superiority and non-inferiority.  
The immunogenicity population in Cohort 2 were around 100 individuals in each age group, who received a 
4th dose with Original/Omicron BA.4-5 30 μg. For descriptive immunogenicity, 100 individuals is acceptable. 
Combining Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, there were almost 300 individuals in each age group (18-55 and >55). As 
a comparison arm, approximately 300 individuals older than 55 who had received a 4th dose of Original 30 μg 
in study C4591031, were selected. This comparison arm is valuable as all study participants have received 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 79/105 
 
 
the same number (4) of doses as in the active arm. The sample size about 300 individuals in each arm is 
sufficient for the superiority and non-inferiority testing.  
The descriptive data from Cohort 2 demonstrated the immunogenicity of a 4th dose with Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 in all studied age groups in terms of raised GMTs. The hypothesis analyses were conducted in the 
combined cohorts 2 and 3. The MAH used the same model based calculation for GMRs as in study C4591048 
SSD. These results were presented in Table 23 and the MAH has explained that the model based GMT values 
of >55 years Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine group participants depend on the comparator group. The MAH 
also explained that the GMR originates from model based GMT calculation, which is considered as an 
intermediate estimate in order to reach a more valid and meaningful model-based GMR. If presented 
together in the product information, descriptive GMTs and model- based GMTs for the same groups would be 
confusing, therefore the presentation of descriptive non adjusted GMTs and model based GMR in the same 
table has been agreed. 
The model-based GMR showed superiority (GMR 2.91 95% CI 2.45; 3.44) of antibody titer against Omicron 
BA. 4-5 after a 4th dose with the bivalent Original/Omicron BA. 4-5 vaccine (15/15 μg) compared to 4th dose 
with Original 30 μg vaccine in the age group older than 55. The non-inferior response to the reference strain 
was also demonstrated (GMR 1.38; 95% CI 1.22, 1.56). As non-inferiority (GMR 0.98; 95% CI 0.83, 1.16) 
was demonstrated also for responses to Omicron BA 4-5 between 18-55 and >55 arms in the bivalent group, 
one can conclude that superiority of the bivalent vaccine to elicit anti Omicron BA. 4-5 response should be 
anticipated in the entire adult population. The non-inferior seroresponse to Omicron BA.4-5 was met between 
age groups older or younger than 55 years in study C4591044, but seroresponse in this study age group was 
higher than in C4591031 Substudy E and non-inferiority was not met (difference 26.77 % (95% CI: 19.59, 
33.95)) (Table 23). 
Descriptive data from Cohorts 2 and 3 showed generally the same result for all age cohorts, including 
adolescents. There was no comparison group for 12-17 year olds from study C4591031. 
These data show that the Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 μg) vaccine is immunogenic as a 4th dose in 
individuals older than 12 years of age who have previously received 3 doses of Original 30 μg. It is 
anticipated that this vaccine is immunogenic also as a primary series as half of the amount of mRNA is the 
same as in approved Original vaccine and Omicron BA4-5 component has been demonstrating 
immunogenicity as a booster dose.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
These data show that Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 μg) is immunogenic as a 4th dose in individuals older 
than 6m to <5 y who have previously received 3 doses of Original 3 μg.  
No dose-response study has been presented for the Original /Omicron BA 4-5 (1.5/1.5 µg) vaccine and the 
lowest dose in the Original study was 3 µg. As altogether the bivalent vaccine contains 3 µg, it is considered 
that the amount of mRNA is immunogenic. The ongoing Substudy A is investigating a dose-response of 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 among children younger than 5 years, data is expected to be submitted as soon as 
available. 
The immunogenicity against newly circulating strains was low and therefore the clinical benefit against new 
strains is unknown.

2.6.5.  Clinical safety 
To support the indication of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine Original/Omicron BA.4-5 administered as a 
primary series as well as a booster dose at 1.5/1.5µg in subjects aged ≥6 months to <5 years of age, the 
MAH presented data from a limited number of participants included in the study C4591048 Substudy B Group 
2 Subset ≥6 Months to <5 Years of Age. No data where the bivalent vaccine has been administered as a 
primary series has been provided. 
In addition, data from studies C4591048 and C4591044 including subjects ≥5 years of age and ≥12 years of 
age who have received the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine as a booster dose have been provided 
as supportive data for extrapolation purposes.  
The primary series of three doses BNT162b2 Original 3µg for children aged 6 months to <5 years of age was 
evaluated in the EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 procedure. 
The studies are described separately below. 
2.6.5.1.  Study C4591048 Substudy B Group 2 Subset (≥6 Months to <5 Years of Age: Booster 
(Fourth Dose) With BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 3 μg 
One month post forth dose safety data is available for a subset of 60 subjects in this study, cut-off date is 25 
November 2022. 
The safety population included 24 participants ≥6 months <2 years of age and 36 participants ≥2 years to 
<5 years of age who received a fourth dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 3 μg. No 
participants were excluded from the safety population for any reason and all participants received the fourth 
dose of vaccine as assigned. Overall, median follow-up time after study vaccination was 1.8 months. Majority 
of participants (96.7%) completed the 1-month post vaccination visit. No participant in the ≥6 months to <2 
years of age group and 1 participant in the ≥2 to <5 years of age group was withdrawn due to personal 
decision from the study as of the data cut-off date (25 November 2022). 
The reactogenicity and antipyretic/pain medication were reported by using an e-diary for 7 days after study 
vaccination. Grading scales were based on FDA guidance. AEs are collected from the study vaccination up to 
1 month after the study vaccination, and serious AEs (SAEs) are collected from study vaccination up to 6 
months post-Dose. Reactogenicity was reported as follows: 
Children ≥6 months to <2 years of age: 
• Local reactions: tenderness, redness, and swelling at the injection site 
• Systemic events: fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness, and irritability 
Children ≥2 to <5 years of age: 
• Local reactions: pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site 
• Systemic events: fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea, new or worsened muscle pain, and 
new or worsened joint pain 
•  Demographics 
≥6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
In total, most participants were White (54.2%), with 4.2% Black or African American participants, 20.8% 
Asian participants, and 20.8% multiracial participants. There were 16.7% Hispanic/Latino participants. 
Median age was 19 months and 58.3% of participants were female. A total of 41.7% of participants had

Page 81/105 
 
 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (“baseline positive”). Median time since last prior dose of BNT162b2 
before study vaccination was 6.4 months. None of the participant received a non-study vaccine after study 
vaccination as of the data cut-off date. 
≥2 to <5 Years of Age 
In total, most participants were White (61.1%), with 5.6% Black or African American participants, 11.1% 
Asian participants, and 22.2% multiracial participants. There were 30.6% Hispanic/Latino participants. 
Median age was 2.0 years and 55.6% of participants were male. Three (8.3%) participants were reported as 
obese. A total of 19.4% of participants were baseline positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median time 
since last prior dose of BNT162b2 before study vaccination was 7.1 months. The medical histories of 
participants at study baseline included conditions and procedures typically observed in the general population 
for each age group.  
Two (5.6%) participants received a non-study vaccine (Influenza vaccine) at least 14 days after study 
vaccination as allowed per protocol. 
Reactogenicity 
Local reactions 
≥6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
All local reactions were mild in severity. No moderate, severe, or Grade 4 local reactions were reported. The 
onset for all local reactions was 1 day and resolved within 1 day after onset. 
In this initial subset of 24 participants, the frequencies of local reactions reported within 7 days after the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg vaccine are much lower than the frequencies 
previously observed in association with the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective age group. 
According to the MAH, this is likely a factor of the small number of participants for this dataset. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 82/105 
 
 
≥2 to <5 Years of Age 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No severe or Grade 4 local reactions were reported by 
any participant in the ≥2 to <5 years of age group who received a fourth dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg. The onset for all local reactions was 1 to 2 days, and all events resolved 
within 1 to 3 days after onset. 
In this initial subset of 36 participants, the frequencies of local reactions reported within 7 days after the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg vaccine are much lower than the frequencies 
previously observed in association with the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective age group. 
According to the MAH, this is likely a factor of the small number of participants for this dataset.

Systemic Events 
≥6 Months to <2 Years of Age 
No participants reported fever >38.4 °C. Antipyretic or pain medication use was reported by 8.3% of 
participants after study vaccination. Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. No severe or 
Grade 4 systemic events were reported by any participant in the ≥6 months to <2 years of age group who 
received a fourth dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg. 
The median onset for all systemic events was 2 to 6 days, and all events resolved within a median duration of 
1 to 3 days after onset. 
In this initial subset of 24 participants, the frequencies of systemic reactions reported within 7 days after the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg vaccine are much lower than the frequencies 
previously observed in association with the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective age group. 
According to the MAH, this is likely a factor of the small number of participants for this dataset.

≥2 to <5 Years of Age 
Antipyretic or pain medication use was reported by 2.8% of participants after study vaccination. 
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. No severe or Grade 4 systemic events were 
reported by any participant in the ≥2 years to <5 years of age group who received a fourth dose of the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg. The median onset for most systemic events was 1 to 6 
days, and most events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. One participant reported 
headache and chills, which lasted 24 days. 
In this initial subset of 36 participants, the frequencies of systemic reactions reported within 7 days after the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 3 μg vaccine are lower than the frequencies previously 
observed in association with the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective age group. According to the 
MAH, this is likely a factor of the small number of participants for this dataset.

Adverse Events 
Overall, AEs were reported by 3 (12.5%) and 1 (2.8%) participant in the ≥6 months to <2 years of age 
group and 2 to <5 years of age group, respectively. No severe, life- threatening, SAEs or AEs leading to 
withdrawal or death were reported from study vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination. Overall, the AE 
profile at 1 month post dose was generally similar to that at 7 days post dose. 
No additional AEs were reported up to data cut-off date of 25 November 2022.

Table 26. 
Immediate Adverse Events 
No participant in the ≥6 months to <2 years and ≥2 to <5 years of age groups were reported to have an 
immediate AE within 30 minutes of study vaccination. 
Related Adverse Events 
AEs assessed by the investigator as related were reported by 1 (4.2%) participant in the ≥6 months to <2 
years of age group. These events were consistent with reactogenicity events and included fatigue (n=1) and 
injection site pain (n=1) 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
No severe or life-threatening AEs were reported from study vaccination through 1 month post vaccination. 
Deaths and Serious Adverse Events 
No deaths or SAEs were reported by participants in the ≥6 months to <2 years of age group and ≥2 years to 
<5 years of age group from study vaccination through 1 month post vaccination. 
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs reported from study vaccination through 1 month post vaccination 
for participants in the ≥6 months to <2 years of age group and ≥2 years to <5 years of age group. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023

Other Significant Adverse Events 
Some AEs are of specific interest due to their autoimmune or neuroinflammatory nature, theoretical 
association with vaccines, or known occurrence in patients with COVID-19. From study vaccination through 1 
month post dose, no AEs of lymphadenopathy, rash, anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, 
and myo/pericarditis were reported up to 1 month post vaccination. 
MAH Conclusion 
Based on the available safety data from a subset of 60 participants (the first 24 and 36 participants enrolled 
in ≥6 months to <2 years age group and ≥2 years to <5 years age group, respectively) from study 
vaccination through 1-month post study vaccination, the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at the 
3 μg dose level was generally well tolerated across both age groups (≥6 months to <2 years of age and ≥2 
to <5 years of age), with mostly mild or moderate reactogenicity and few reported AEs. No new adverse 
reactions were identified based on the available data from this data cut. 
In this initial subset of 60 participants, the frequencies of local and systemic reactions reported within 7 days 
after the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 3 μg vaccine are lower than the frequencies 
previously observed in association with the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective age group. This 
is likely a factor of the small number of participants for this dataset. 
The incidence of any AEs within 1 month post study vaccination was low (n=4). No immediate AEs, severe 
AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to withdrawal were reported. No AEs of clinical interest were reported (eg, 
anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, myo/pericarditis). No new or concerning safety 
findings were noted in this subset of 60 participants up to at least 1 month post vaccination data. 
Based on the safety data up to 1 month post vaccination with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-
5) at the 3 μg dose level in these 60 Study C4591048 participants ≥6 months to <2 years and ≥2 years to 
<5 years of age, the Original/Omicron BA.4-5 bivalent vaccine appears to be safe and tolerable in this 
population with no significant new safety information identified in this age group. 
2.6.5.2.  Study C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 (≥5 to <12 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth Dose) 
With BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg 
The study is further described in EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0177/G procedure where the use of the bivalent 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine (5/5µg) was evaluated for use as primary series. 
o  The safety population included 113 participants ≥5 years to <12 years of age who received a fourth 
dose with BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 10 μg. Median follow-up time after study 
vaccination was 1.6 months. Cut-off date was 25 Nov 2022. 
o  The safety profile within 1 month after study vaccination (fourth dose) with bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 vaccine at the 10µg (5/5 µg) was generally well tolerated, with mostly mild or moderate 
reactogenicity and few reported AEs. No new adverse reactions were identified based on the available 
data from this data cut. 
o  The reactogenicity profile within 7 days after administration of bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
vaccine at the 10µg (5/5 µg) was generally similar to that previously observed in association with 
administration of BNT162b2 Original 10µg in this age group.

o  The AE profile within 1 month after study vaccination was consistent with the known safety profile of 
BNT162b2 Original. Incidence of AEs, including severe AEs, was low. No immediate AEs, SAEs, or AEs 
leading to withdrawal were reported. One male participant between 10 and 17 years of age reported 
an event of lymph node palpable (left axillary lymph node palpable) of moderate severity with onset 
on Day 2 after study vaccination that resolved within 3 days. The event was assessed by the 
investigator as related to study intervention. Other than this 1 case of lymph node palpable, no other 
AEs of clinical interest were reported (eg, rash, anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s 
palsy, myo/pericarditis). No new or concerning safety findings were noted in these 113 participants 
up to 1 month of post vaccination data. 
o  Based on the safety data up to 1-month after study vaccination with bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-
5 vaccine at the 10µg (5/5µg) in 113 participants in study C4591048 participants ≥5 years to <12 
years of age, the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine at the 10µg (5/5µg) appears to be 
consistent with the known safety profile of BNT162b2. 
2.6.5.3.  Study C4591044 Cohorts 2 (≥12 Years of Age) and 3 (≥18 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth 
Dose) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 or 60 μg 
This study was previously evaluated in EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/059.1 and is also described in the 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0177/G procedure. 
o 
In Cohort 2 (All Groups), the safety population included 528 participants ≥12 years of age who 
received a booster (fourth dose) with BNT162b2 Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 30 or 60 μg. In 
combined Cohort 2 (Groups 2 and 4) and Cohort 3, the safety population included 619 participants 
who received BNT162b2 Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 30 μg: 313 participants who were 18 
through 55 years of age and 306 participants who were >55 years of age; median follow-up time 
after study vaccination to the data cut off (12 Oct 2022) or withdrawal date across vaccine groups 
was 1.5 months. 
o  The safety profile within 1 month after vaccination (Dose 4) with BNT162b2 Bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 at the 30-μg dose level was well tolerated across all age groups, with mostly mild or 
moderate reactogenicity and few reported AEs. 
o  The reactogenicity profile within 7 days after BNT162b2 Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine 
was generally similar to that previously observed in association with booster doses of an Omicron 
BA.1-modified BNT162b2 bivalent vaccine and to BNT162b2 Original within the respective age groups 
at the same dose. Both local reactions and systemic events for participants who received the 30-μg 
dose level tended to be lower for adults >55 years of age compared with younger adult participants 
(18 through 55 years of age). There was an observed dose dependency for reactogenicity between 
the BNT162b2 bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 where 30- and 60-μg groups with most local 
reactions and systemic events reported more frequently after a 60-μg dose, which is consistent with 
prior observations for BA.1-modified bivalent and monovalent vaccines. 
o  The AE profile within 1 month after vaccination consisted of reactogenicity events, labelled reactions 
(eg, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia), and other AEs that occur in a general adult population. Incidence 
of lymphadenopathy, severe AEs, and SAEs was low. No life-threatening (Grade 4) events were 
reported. No new or concerning safety findings were noted 1 month after vaccination.

2.6.5.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post authorization safety data for BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) in subjects aged ≥6 
months to <5 years of age has been provided. The MAH will continue to monitor all emerging post 
authorization safety data for BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) for pharmacovigilance and risk 
management purposes. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To support the indication of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine Original/Omicron BA.4-5 administered as a 
primary series as well as a booster dose at 1.5/1.5µg in subjects aged ≥6 months to <5 years of age, the 
MAH has presented data from a limited number (n=60) of participants included in the study C4591048 
Substudy B Group 2 Subset ≥6 Months to <5 Years of age. These subjects are divided into two subgroups 
based on age: 24 participants ≥6 months <2 years of age and 36 participants ≥2 years to <5 years of age. 
Both groups received a fourth dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 1.5/1.5 μg. No 
data where the bivalent vaccine has been administered as a primary series has been provided. 
In addition, data from studies C4591048 and C4591044 including subjects ≥5 years of age and ≥12 years of 
age who has received the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine as a booster dose have been provided as 
supportive data for extrapolation purposes. 
Study C4591048 Substudy B 
The 60 subjects are presented into two subgroups based on age: 24 participants ≥6 months <2 years of age 
and 36 participants ≥2 years to <5 years of age. Both groups received a fourth dose of the bivalent 
BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) vaccine at 1.5/1.5 μg. No subjects were excluded based on safety 
reasons. One-month post vaccination visit was completed by around 97% of the subjects and the median 
follow-up time after the booster dose was 1.8 months. More than half of the participants in both age groups 
were white. In the youngest age group 58% of participants were female and among the older children 56% 
were male. Median time since last prior dose of BNT162b2 Original was 6.4-7.1 months for the younger and 
older age groups, respectively . Baseline positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection was noted among 42% in the 
youngest group and in 19% of the older children. 
Reactogenicity: Few and mild local reactions were reported among the 24 children aged ≥6 months <2 years 
who received Original/Omicron BA.4-5 3µg as a fourth dose. Redness was reported among 8% of the 
subjects and 4% reported swelling. None of the subjects were presented with tenderness at injection site. No 
new safety concern is detected here. Low frequency of local reactions was reported in the 36 children aged 
≥2 to <5 years, most of the reactions were mild or moderate. Pain at the injection site (28%) was the most 
noted local reaction. No grade 4 reaction was reported. 
Few and mostly mild systemic events were reported in both age groups. Among the 24 children aged ≥6 
months to <2 years, irritability (18%) was the most commonly reported event. None of the children reported 
fever >38.4oC. Antipyretic medication was used in 8% of the subjects. Among the subjects aged ≥2-<5 years 
of age, fatigue (31%) was the most commonly systemic event followed by diarrhoea (6%). Most of the 
events were mild or moderate at severity and no grade 4 event was reported. Antipyretic or pain medication 
was noted among 3% of the children.  
It is noted that the frequency of local and systemic events is low. The MAH suggests that the lower frequency 
of reactogenicity reported in this study compared to the previous study where the subjects received a 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 90/105 
 
 
primary series of the Original 3 µg vaccine (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 procedure) is a factor of the small 
number of participants in this study. It should however be noted that in the study presented in 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 procedure, the frequency of the reported systemic events was almost similar 
among the children that received original and placebo, suggesting that the frequency of systemic events 
might not be too different between original and the Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in these age groups. It is 
however not possible to compare between studies or to draw any firm conclusions based only on 24+36 
participants. Nevertheless, the low reported frequency of both local and systemic events in this study does 
not suggest new or additional safety concerns in terms of reactogenicity. 
AEs: Up to the cut-off date, AEs were reported by 3 (12.5%) children aged ≥6 months to <2 years and in 
one (2.8%) child in the 2 to <5 years of age group. No severe, life-threatening, SAE or adverse event leading 
to withdrawal was reported. No AESI was reported. Two of the AEs were considered related to vaccination, 
these were consistent with reactogenicity events (fatigue, pain at the injection site). 
No new safety concern was identified among the limited number of subjects aged 6 months to <5 years 
receiving Original/Omicron BA.4-5 1.5/1.5 µg as a fourth dose. 
C4591048 and C4591044 
In these two studies, BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 was administered as a fourth dose at 10 µg to 
subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years of age, at 30 µg to subjects aged ≥12-17 years and at 30µg or 60 µg to 
subjects ≥18 years of age. Among the subjects that received either 30 or 60 µg, a clear trend to higher 
reactogenicity with higher dose was noted. No new safety concerns were identified in those studies.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg has been administered as a fourth dose to 60 subjects 
aged ≥6 months to <5 years. Overall, the reactogenicity profile was in line with the results obtained when 
the monovalent BNT162b2 at 3 µg was administered as a primary series. The frequency of reported AEs and 
SAEs was very low.  
Supportive data for extrapolation purposes has been provided, where subjects in different age groups from 5 
years onwards have received the bivalent vaccine at different dose levels as a fourth dose. The results 
suggest a similar safety profile between the monovalent original and the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
vaccine. 
From a safety perspective, this suggests that the bivalent vaccine could be used as a primary series and 
booster for the age group ≥6 months to <5 years of age. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The currently valid RMP is version 9.0, which was approved in procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0147 on 10 
November 2022 and is a consolidated EU RMP version that merges RMP v 7.2 and 8.0 and addresses the 
PRAC preliminary assessment request to remove Myocarditis and Pericarditis, and Vaccine-associated 
enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) as safety 
concerns in study C4591048.

2.7.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance 
Section III.1 Routine pharmacovigilance was largely unchanged relative to the approved RMP version 9.0, 
with the exception of the following addition (added text in green): 
In the section Potential Medication errors/Vial differentiation the Tozinameran/Famtozinameran 1.5/1.5 mcg 
formulation has been added in the text as follows:  
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 mcg)/dose – 6 months through 4 years of age, 
Dilute before use - Maroon cap: If attempted to not dilute with 2.2 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution, the user would only be able to extract approximately 1 dose instead of 10 doses as the filled volume 
is 0.4 mL. If 1.8 mL of diluent (purple cap amount) or 1.3 mL of diluent (orange cap amount) were used, this 
under dilution would also reduce the number of doses retrieved out of the vial, which might indicate to the 
HCP that there had been an error in preparation. 
In Table 27 Vaccine Presentation Characteristics (below) the new formulation has been added in the last 
column.

Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
Within the context of routine pharmacovigilance the MAH is expected and has committed to take into account 
the introduction of any (also future) new formulation(s) upon evaluation of any new unexpected trends or 
patterns in adverse event reporting (e.g. medication errors, reactogenicity, immunogenicity), as appropriate. 
The full study protocol for C4591052 and C4591051 is currently ongoing. 
PRAC, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation PhV 
development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
PRAC also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation 
measures. 
2.7.3.  Plans for post-authorisation efficacy studies 
Not applicable. 
2.7.4.  Risk minimisation measures 
Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
No changes are proposed. This is accepted. 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
PRAC having considered the data submitted was of the opinion that: 
the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication(s). 
Part VI Summary of the risk management plan 
PRAC concludes that the updates are administrative and acceptable. 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP do not require revision following the conclusion of the 
procedure. 
2.7.5.  Conclusion on the RMP 
After the PRAC meeting, the MAH took the opportunity and submitted RMP version 10.0, merging versions 
9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 of the RMP submitted and reviewed with this procedure, procedure X180, and II177, and 
implementing an agreed 6 months delay for interim report of study C4591007. The CHMP considered that the 
risk management plan version 10.0 is acceptable.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system   
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability 
of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the flexibilities 
described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 
rev.1, from 16 December 2020)5 document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of COVID-19 
vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities.  
• English-only labelling (inner and outer label/carton) and package leaflet* (from start of supply until end 
2023). 
• Without country-specific information, such as blue box requirements (from start of supply until end 2023). 
All MSs (with one exception: Poland**) have agreed to extend the current derogations until the end of 2023; 
this will allow the MAH to make all necessary adjustments so that by Jan 2024 the MAH can revert to full EU 
labelling requirements.  
*MAH should ensure provision of the package leaflet in national language(s) to relevant member states, 
separately to vaccine supply, as stated in Q2 Q&A flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines, with the exception  of 
Germany.  
**The MAH should address this labelling exemption request directly to the Polish NCA.:

2.9.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
The updates of the QR code/URL to include further references to Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 
micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection, as well as the necessary layout changes on the website shall be 
submitted and assessed via an Article 61.3 notification (post-authorisation). 
2.9.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Comirnaty (tozinameran) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as a new active substance and new biological.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns an extension of indication to add a new strength of 1.5/1.5 micrograms/dose for 
Comirnaty bivalent (Original/OMI BA.4-5), as primary series and booster for children 6 months-< 5 years.  
There are no data investigating the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/OMI BA.4-5) as a primary series in any age 
group: the evaluation is solely based on extrapolation from booster studies where the product was given as 
the fourth dose. There are no dose-finding studies for this age group with Original or the bivalent vaccines 
below the 3 µg dose. 
The ETF has previously concluded that the bivalent formulation may be used for primary vaccination 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/etf-concludes-bivalent-original-omicron-ba4-5-mrna-vaccines-may-
be-used-primary-vaccination) based on non-clinical studies and data on the immune response following 
natural infection with omicron BA.4/5. The data suggested that primary vaccination with the bivalent 
formulation should give rise to a broad immune response in unvaccinated people and that the safety profile 
would be comparable to the original vaccine (based on booster studies).  
In accordance with the recommendations from the EMA statement on updating COVID-19 vaccines 
composition for new SARS-CoV-2 virus variants (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/ecdc-
ema-statement-updating-covid-19-vaccines-composition-new-sars-cov-2-virus-variants_en.pdf), the vaccine 
posology has been simplified for all approved formulations. 
3.2.  Therapeutic Context 
3.2.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China and 
has rapidly spread around the world by human-to-human transmission. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 99/105 
 
 
3.2.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently available therapies have different benefit-risk considerations depending on the stage of illness and 
disease manifestations. While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, 
vaccination has been the most effective medical countermeasure to decrease the risk and mitigate spread of 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
There are COVID-19 vaccines available for the age group 6 months-< 5 years, but none specific for any 
Omicron variant. While the majority of the global population has either received COVID-19 vaccination or 
been exposed to the virus, the need for primary vaccination is considerably smaller than previously during 
the pandemic, however there is still demand for a vaccine that can be used for primary vaccination.  
The original Comirnaty is still available, however it may be more appropriate to use variant adapted vaccines 
also for primary vaccination. There is currently no Omicron vaccine approved for primary vaccination in any 
age group.  
3.2.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support the indication of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine Original/Omicron BA.4-5 administered as a 
primary series as well as a booster dose at 1.5/1.5µg in subjects aged ≥6 months to <5 years of age, the 
MAH has presented data from a limited number of participants included in the study C4591048 Substudy B 
Group 2 Subset ≥6 Months to <5 Years of Age. No data where the bivalent vaccine has been 
administered as a primary series have been provided. 
In addition, data from studies C4591048 and C4591044 including subjects ≥5 years of age and ≥12 years of 
age who have received the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine as a booster dose have been provided 
as supportive data for extrapolation purposes. 
3.3.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy has previously been demonstrated for primary vaccination with the Original vaccine against 
symptomatic COVID-19 for all age groups. 
Immunogenicity data of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 as a 4th dose in children who have earlier 
received 3 doses of the Original vaccine were submitted. Descriptive immunogenicity data (GMTs, GMFRs, 
Seroresponse rate) were presented for a small subset (N= 60) of the planned study population (N=300) at 
age 6m-<5y. 
At 1-month post, a fourth dose bivalent Original/Omi BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg in participants ≥6 months to <5 
years of age in the C4591048 Substudy B who received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 elicited antibody 
responses to both BA.4-5 and the referenced strain.  
The supportive data from age groups 5-<12 y (5/5 µg), and 12-17, 18-55 and >55 (15/15 µg) vaccinated 
with age group specific Original/Omi BA.4-5 vaccine demonstrated the immunogenicity of Original/Omi BA.4-
5 as 4th dose after 3 doses of Original vaccine.  
These data show that Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 μg) is immunogenic as a 4th dose in individuals older 
than 6m to <5 y who have received 3 prior doses of Original 3 μg. Immunogenicity studies in naïve mice 
showed that when compared to the original vaccine, the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 vaccine (combination of 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 100/105 
 
 
BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 Omicron BA.4/BA.5) elicited a greater breadth of neutralizing antibody responses 
against all variants and sub-lineages tested. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no clinical data from a primary series with a bivalent Original/Omi BA.4-5 vaccine submitted. This 
is valid for all age groups including children at age 6m- <5 y receiving Original/Omi BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg. 
The clinical data submitted for the bivalent vaccine originate exclusively from booster studies.  
While the principle of extrapolation of efficacy of a bivalent booster dose to a bivalent primary series is 
accepted, no dose-response study has been presented for Original /Omicron BA 4-5 (1.5/1.5 µg). There were 
previous concerns about the immunogenicity of the total dose of 3ug in the youngest children, which has 
prompted a three-dose schedule. Notably, the lowest dose in the Original vaccine study was 3 µg. There are 
no data currently presented which could show that 1.5 µg of Original suffices to give a broad immune 
response that would be expected to provide protection against severe disease.  
The comparison between immune responses to a fourth dose of a bivalent vaccine and a third dose of original 
vaccine is of less relevance, as the vaccinees have received a different number of doses. Thus, the following 
results would have been of interest when comparing 4th doses of both vaccines: 
• 
Higher Omicron BA.4_5-specific neutralizing titers compared with the titers in a comparator group of 
participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3 who received 3 doses of Original 3 µg. 
• 
Similar reference strain-specific titers compared with the titers in the comparator group of 
participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3 who received 3 doses of BNT162b2. 
There is no immune correlate of protection established so far. The extent of increased efficacy given a certain 
increment in immunogenicity, is not known. The same pertains to the breadth of the immune response as 
well as the duration of protection. 
The immunogenicity against newly circulating strains was shown to be low. Therefore, the clinical benefit of 
Original/Omicron BA. 4-5 against new strains is unknown.  
3.5.  Unfavourable effects 
The reactogenicity profile appears to be mild among the 60 subjects aged ≥6 months to <5 years of age that 
received bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg as a fourth dose. The most commonly reported local 
reaction was redness (8%) among the youngest children aged ≥6 months to <2 years of age and pain at 
injection site (28%) among children aged ≥2-<5 years. For systemic events irritability (18%) was most 
commonly reported among the youngest children and fatigue (31%) among the older children. Antipyretic or 
pain medication was used among 3-8% of the children.  
No new safety concern was identified among the limited number of subjects aged 6 months to <5 years 
receiving Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg as a fourth dose. 
3.6.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The study population is limited, including only 24 participants ≥6 months <2 years of age and 36 participants 
≥2 years to <5 years of age. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023 
Page 101/105 
 
 
Safety data for BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg is only available when administered as a 
fourth dose, none of the age groups has received the bivalent vaccine as a primary series. 
It is noted that the frequency of local and systemic events is low. The MAH suggests that the lower frequency 
of reactogenicity reported in this study compared to the previous study where subjects received a primary 
series of the Original 3 µg (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 procedure) is a factor of the small number of 
participants in this study. It should however be noted that in the study presented in 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138 procedure, the frequency of the reported systemic events was almost similar 
among the children that received original and placebo, suggesting that the frequency of systemic events 
might not be too different between original and the Original/Omicron BA.4-5 in these age groups. It is 
however not possible to reliably compare between studies or to draw any firm conclusions based only on 
24+36 participants.

3.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.8.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit of the product is the induction of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, which is likely to protect 
against severe COVID-19 disease. The original vaccine has proven highly effective in this regard, when used 
as a primary series. 
Considering the following, the extrapolation of the efficacy of a bivalent original/variant vaccine from boosting 
to a primary series is considered in principle possible. 
•  Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 has demonstrated superior immune responses to BA.1 and non-
inferior responses to the reference strain in older age groups 
•  Any bivalent original/variant vaccine is considered to have similar characteristics as the 
Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine 
•  Booster responses of the same magnitude can be extrapolated to primary vaccination 
• 
• 
It is unknown when primary vaccination data will be available 
It is likely that primary vaccination with a vaccine covering currently circulating strains is superior 
against these, compared to primary vaccination with the original vaccine 
As the total amount of mRNA in the bivalent vaccine is 3 µg, it is considered that the amount of mRNA is 
immunogenic. The ongoing Substudy A of C4591048 is investigating dose-response of Original/Omicron BA.4-
5 among children younger than 5 years, data is expected to be submitted as soon as available. 
The safety profiles of Comirnaty variant vaccines have not differed in a relevant way. Moreover, the 
reactogenicity of the selected dose in the smallest children may be considered low. Thus safety may be 
extrapolated from the booster scenario to the primary series. 
3.8.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance is considered positive for Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 1.5/1.5 µg among children 6m-
<5y as both primary series and a booster dose 
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, immunogenicity and safety, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose is favourable 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/355550/2023

in the following indication: 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (1.5/1.5 micrograms)/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is 
indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in infants and children aged 6 
months to 4 years. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for COMIRNATY subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any 
agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

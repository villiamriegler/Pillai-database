EMA to expand the Norvir (ritonavir) SmPC for the Drug-
Drug Interactions (DDIs) of ritonavir with direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran and edoxaban to align 
with recent updates to the Prezista (darunavir) label. This 
request resulted from the Norvir LEG 033-12, which is the 
commitment to "… update the product information annually 
with any relevant information on boosted protease 
inhibitors that may be approved in the future." 
Although in contrast to the situation for darunavir, no direct 
DDI data are available for ritonavir (and the combination of 
lopinavir and ritonavir) with dabigatran etexilate; from a 
mechanistic point of view, it is considered highly likely by 
the Committee that a comparable DDI between ritonavir 
(or lopinavir/ritonavir) with the P-gp substrates dabigatran 
etexilate and edoxaban will occur, leading to increased 
bioavailability of these DOACs. The Committee considers 
the above sufficiently supported by literature data (Testa S 
et al, 2020, publishing cases displaying such increased 
exposures). 
Ritonavir is also an active ingredient of Kaletra 
(lopinavir/ritonavir) and Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir).  
In this light, based on the above, sections 4.5 of the SmPCs 
of Norvir, Kaletra and Aluvia are updated to add the 
treatment recommendations for dabigatran exilate and 
edoxaban. The Package Leaflets (PL) are updated 
accordingly.

A bibliographic and post-marketing data search showed 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC on the potential 
interaction with apalutamide, a moderate to strong 
CYP3A4 inducer, as well as with encorafenib, 
following an evaluation of the potential drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) between LPV/RTV (Kaletra and 
Aluvia) with apalutamide (Erleada) and encorafenib 
(Braftovi) through bibliographic and post-marketing 
data search. The Package Leaflet is also updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
that the concomitant use of lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) 
(Kaletra and Aluvia) or ritonavir (Norvir) with apalutamide 
and encorafenib is not recommended. This is due to the 
fact that LPV/RTV are both inhibitors of CYP3A and the co-
administration with apalutamide and encorafenib, both 
anticancer agents which are primarily metabolised by 
CYP3A, may result in increased plasma concentrations and 
lead to increased toxicity and potential risk for serious 
adverse events. 
Additionally, apalutamide, an inhibitor of androgen 
receptors indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer, is 
a strong inducer of CYP3A4. The co-administration of 
apalutamide with LPV is expected to decrease LPV exposure 
and potentially lead to virological failure and resistance 
emergence. Given the metabolic properties of LPV, RTV and 
apalutamide, and that these three compounds are 
metabolised through CYP3A, the net effect of LPV/RTV and 
apalutamide combination is unpredictable and hence, their 
co-administration is not recommended.  
Similarly, encorafenib, a kinase inhibitor indicated for the 
treatment of metastatic melanoma, is both an inhibitor and 
inducer of CYP3A4 and may also affect CYP3A4 substrates

Lopinavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of the P450 isoform 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to include information on the contraindication with 
neratinib and interactions with abemaciclib, neratinib 
and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. In addition, the 
Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to 
update section 4.5 of the SmPC of Kaletra and Aluvia 
to add information on the interaction of 
lopinavir/ritonavir with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, as well as to 
remove information on the interaction with 
boceprevir and telaprevir. Furthermore, the quantity 
of tenofovir disoproxil has been amended in sections 
CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration with medicinal products 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased 
plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, 
which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and may 
increase the potential for serious and/or life threatening 
reactions. Therefore, concomitant use of ritonavir and 
lopinavir/ritonavir with neratinib and abemaciclib, are 
contraindicated. 
Furthermore, ritonavir and lopinavir are inhibitors of 
OATP1B1, P-glycoprotein and BCRP. Therefore, concomitant 
administration of ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir and 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is not recommended due to an 
increased risk of ALT elevations associated with increased 
glecaprevir exposure.  
Moreover, serum concentrations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir 
Page 8/56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 and 5.1 of the Kaletra and Aluvia SmPCs (as 
requested during procedure WS 1555) as 300 mg 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is equivalent to 245 mg 
tenofovir disoproxil . The Package Leaflets are 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance

and voxilaprevir may be increased due to P-glycoprotein, 
BCRP and OATP1B1/3 inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Therefore, it is not recommended to co administer 
lopinavir/ritonavir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ voxilaprevir 
due to a potential risk associated with increase in 
voxilaprevir exposure. 
Based on these potential drug-drug interactions, sections 
4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of the product information for 
ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir fixed-dose combination 
have been updated to provide further guidance for use in 
combination with these medical products.

Update of sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to add information regarding the interaction of 
lopinavir/ritonavir and ritonavir with lurasidone and 
ranolazine. In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC are updated to add information regarding the 
ranolazine (antianginal) or lurasidone 
(antipsychotic/neuroleptic) is contraindicated. This is 
because due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir, 
concentrations of ranolazine or lurasidone are expected to 
increase and this increases the potential for serious and/or 
life-threatening reactions.

KONCERT/PENTA 18 is a prospective multicentre, 
randomised, open-label study that evaluated the 
pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy and safety of twice-daily 
versus once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 
mg tablets dosed by weight as part of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) in virologically suppressed 
HIV-1 infected children (n=173).  Children were eligible 
when they were aged <18 years, ≥15 kg in weight, 
receiving cART that included lopinavir/ritonavir, HIV-1 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/ml for at least 24 weeks 
and able to swallow tablets.  At week 24, the efficacy and 
safety with twice-daily dosing (n=87) in the paediatric 
population given lopinavir/ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg tablets 
was consistent with the efficacy and safety findings in 
previous adult and paediatric studies using 
lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily.  The percentage of patients  
achieving HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml at Week 24 was lower 
in the paediatric patients receiving  lopinavir/ritonavir 
tablets once daily (88.2%) than in patients receiving the 
twice-daily dosing (96.6%, p = 0.040), mainly due to lower 
adherence in the once-daily group.  The efficacy data 
favouring the twice-daily regimen are reinforced by a 
differential in pharmacokinetic parameters significantly 
favouring the twice-daily regimen.

ritonavir resulted in increases in simeprevir maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax), area under the time 
concentration curve (AUC24h), and minimum observed 
concentraion (Cmin) by 4.7-, 7.2-, and 14.4-fold 
respectively, compared with simeprevir alone. 
Administration of simeprevir was generally well tolerated 
when administered alone or in combination with ritonavir. 
Based on exploratory exposure-response analysis using 
safety data from three Phase 3 simeprevir trials, higher 
simeprevir exposures (AUC24) were shown to be 
significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse 
events such as rash, pruritus, anemia, photosensitivity, and 
increased bilirubin.  
When darunavir plus ritonavir (800 mg plus 100 mg QD) 
were administered with simeprevir 50 mg QD, the 
increases in simeprevir Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin were 1.8-
, 2.6-, and 4.6-fold, respectively, compared with 150 mg 
QD simeprevir administered alone.  
Based on the significant effect of ritonavir (with or without 
darunavir) on simeprevir concentrations, and the reported 
exposure-safety analyses of simeprevir, co-administration 
of lopinavir/ritonavir and simeprevir is likely to result in 
substantially increased concentrations of simeprevir and 
increased potential for simeprevir-related adverse events. 
Therefore, it is not recommended to co-administer Kaletra 
and simeprevir. 
These data mirror the information provided in the SmPC of 
Olysio. As no specific interaction data are available with 
lopinavir/ritonavir, and given ritonavir is a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor, it is justified to add this drug interaction also to 
the Kaletra product information.

efficacy of the standard regimen 400/100 mg BID, based 
on the suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA in pregnant 
women and prevention of MTCT (mother to child 
transmission).  
Overall, the standard LPV/r dose 400/100 mg BID in 
pregnant women provides adequate LPV exposure. 
However, caution should be warranted for subjects with 
HIV harbouring PI mutations as described in the literature. 
Since neither PK nor clinical studies are available to 
evaluate the risk of virologic failure or safety with once 
daily dosing of LPV/r during pregnancy, the once daily 
dosing to treat pregnant women is not recommended. 
The safety of LPV/r 400/100 mg BID during pregnancy is 
supported by many available data from clinical studies, APR 
and post-marketing experience. The birth defects risk is 
unlikely in humans, but some studies observe an increase 
of prematurity in women receiving PIs (and notably LPV/r). 
However, this risk is not clearly identified and varies 
between studies.  
In conclusion, the available data support the use of 
standard LPV/r dose 400/100 mg BID during pregnancy 
and post-partum.

3 or 4 LPV/rtv 100/25 mg tablets BID) in the following body 
weight bands: ≥ 15 to ≤ 25 kg; > 25 to ≤ 35 kg; > 35 kg. 
The pharmacokinetics parameters AUC0-12h, Cmax and 
Cmin of LPV/rtv were similar between these 3 weight 
bands. Moreover, AUC0-12h was equivalent to that of 
previous studies M05-730 (LPV/rtv tablets 400/100 mg BID 
in adults) and M98-940 (LPV/rtv oral solution at 300/75 
mg/m2 in children), where doses were considered safe and 
effective in the paediatric population. The extrapolation of 
PK parameters obtained with lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 
the oral solution showed a similar AUC0-12h when LPV/rtv 
oral solution is used at 10/2.5 mg/kg BID. 
Overall, although these data are limited they support the 
inclusion of additional paediatric dosing recommendation

CHMP.  
Data on drug-drug interaction between avanafil and 
ritonavir were presented at American College of Clinical 
Pharmacology 2012 annual meeting. The study showed a 
13-fold increase in avanafil AUCinf when co-administered 
with ritonavir 600 mg BID demonstrating the major 
involvement of CYP3A in its metabolism. A similar effect is 
expected with lopinavir/ritonavir. Based on the study 
results, the use of avanafil in combination with 
lopinavir/ritonavir was added as a contra-indication.  
Drug-drug interaction with quetiapine resulting in deep 
coma was identified as a signal and as a consequence the 
CHMP endorsed the PRAC recommendation to add this 
information in section 4.5 and include the contra-indication 
for concomitant use with quetiapine. 
In addition, the 133.3 mg/33.3 mg soft capsules

defect rate of 1.9% among those exposed during the 
critical first trimester. 
The latest update with data cut off as of January 31, 2010 
reported the rate of congenital birth defects in infants 
exposed to lopinavir/ritonavir during the first trimester to 
be similar to the rate reported previously. As of January 31, 
2010, 1,986 infants were exposed to lopinavir/ritonavir 
during first trimester, and second and/or third trimesters 
with a rate of congenital birth defects in first trimester (n = 
590) exposures of 1.7% (95% CI: 0.8 to 3.1). 
Based on the above findings, the CHMP agrees to update 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC to reflect APR findings on 
congenital birth defects associated to lopinavir/ritonavir 
exposure during first trimester in pregnancy. The CHMP 
believes that this additional information will provide more 
information to help prescribers weigh the benefits and risks 
for use of lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy. The CHMP 
also acknowledged that the APR is an ongoing study and as 
additional data becomes available, the language might 
need future revision, if appropriate.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, 
17/02/2011 
18/03/2011 
SmPC, Annex 
A data review on hepatotoxicity with LPV/r was performed 
Annex IIB, and Package Leaflet. 
Update of Section 4.4 of the SPC to provide 
information about the risk of hepatotoxicity in 
individuals treated for post exposure prophylaxis and 
remind the prescriber that this risk also exists in HIV 
mono infected patients.  
Annex IIB is updated to reflect the new Risk 
Management Plan version number 4. 
The MAH took the opportunity to update section 6 of 
the Package Leaflet, by introducing the changes of 
II and PL 
and due to the systematic associated treatment during post 
exposure prophylaxis, it was difficult to assess a causal 
relationship between LPV/r and hepatotoxicity. However, in 
all these cases the role of LPV/r could not be ruled out.  
Consequently, the MAH proposed to add a warning in the 
product information in section 4.4 of the SmPC and provide 
information about the risk of hepatotoxicity in individuals 
treated for post-exposure prophylaxis as well as to remind 
prescribers about this risk in HIV mono infected patients as 
well. The CHMP therefore agreed that close monitoring is

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
needed in patients treated with LPV/r for a PEP indication. 
The CHMP also agreed that the results of the data review 
do not affect the benefit/risk balance of Kaletra. The 
routine pharmacovigilance risk minimisation activities for 
monitoring the risk of hepatotoxicity in mono infected and 
individuals treated for PEP proposed by the MAH were 
endorsed by the CHMP.

on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance,

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Kaletra continues 
to be favourable. The renewal requires no amendments to 
the terms of the Community Marketing Authorisation. The 
CHMP is of the opinion that the renewal can be granted 
with unlimited validity. Finally, the next PSUR will be a 3-

combination therapy in multiple treatment experienced HIV 
1 infected adults, tipranavir (500 mg twice daily) with 
ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), co administered with 
lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily), resulted in a 
70% reduction in lopinavir Cmin. Due to this reduction in

The MAH also took the opportunity to reformat 
section 4.5 of the SmPC in line with the Annex A to 
the guideline on Clinical Development of Medicinal 
Products for Treatment of HIV Infection as requested 
by the CHMP. As a consequence, sections 4.3 and 
4.4 of the SmPC and the PL were updated as well. In 
addition, a minor mistake in section 5.1 relating to 
resistance data was corrected. Finally, the MAH took 
this opportunity to update contact details of local

modifying its clearance but also its distribution or its 
absorption. Therefore, caution is generally warranted for 
any medicinal product used in patients with renal 
impairment. However, this general caution applies to all 
medicinal products when treating patients with sever renal 
impairment. In view of the pharmacokinetics of 
lopinavir/ritonavir (negligible renal clearance), the CHMP 
concluded that there is no reason to include a specific 
warning regarding the use of Kaletra in severe renally 
impaired patients. In addition, based on the review of 
updated Kaletra interaction data, information on statins and 
sildenafil was updated.

in 664 antiretroviral treatment-naïve patients. The results 
of the study showed that the once daily regimen of Kaletra 
tablets was statistically non-inferior to the twice daily 
regimen, therefore, the CHMP agreed to add this option to 
the Kaletra SPC for the tablet formulations. However, there 
were some indicators that in regards to long-term viral

after 2 weeks of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir 400 
mg/100 mg twice daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir administration 
significantly decreased bupropion and its metabolite's 
(hydroxybupropion) plasma exposures. This decrease is 
likely due to the concurrent induction of cytochrome P450 
2B6 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. No 
significant changes in the blood levels of lopinavir or 
ritonavir were found following administration of a single 
dose of bupropion. As the maximum recommended dose of 
bupropion (300 mg / day) should not be increased to 
compensate for this induction effect, the combination 
should be avoided. However, if deemed unavoidable, 
clinical monitoring for lack of bupropion efficacy is 
necessary.

lopinavir/ritonavir and rifampicin, the CHMP considered that 
an increased dose of Kaletra might allow compensating for 
the inducer effect of rifampicin, however such an increased 
dose appeared to be associated with an increased liver 
toxicity. Therefore, the CHMP considered to revise the 
Product Information to downgrade the contra-indication 
concerning rifampicin to a warning and to point out that: 
 - Rifampicin in combination with Kaletra may cause large 
decreases in lopinavir concentrations which may in turn 
significantly decrease the lopinavir therapeutic effect.  
- Adequate exposure to lopinavir/ritonavir may be achieved 
when higher dose of Kaletra is used but this is associated 
with a higher risk of liver and gastrointestinal toxicity.  
- This co-administration should be avoided unless judged 
strictly necessary.

administration of midazolam with fixed combination 
lopinavir/ritonavir in 14 healthy volunteers showed an 
increase of midazolam AUC by about 13 fold when 
midazolam was given orally and an increase by about 4 fold 
when midazolam was given parenterally. Therefore, the co-
administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with orally 
administered midazolam is contraindicated, whereas 
caution should be used when lopinavir/ritonavir is co-
administrated with injection of midazolam.  
If lopinavir/ritonavir is co-administered with injectable 
midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit 
(ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical 
monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of 
respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage 
adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially 
if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.

Kaletra was updated in regards to potential interactions 
with digoxin, fosamprenavir, tadalafil, vardenafil, 
trazodone, tenofovir and voriconazole as well as in regards 
to serious skin reactions. To this purpose, a cumulative 
review was submitted per CHMP request and assessed in 
this type II variation.  
Information on interaction with other medicinal products 
has been refined during the CHMP's assessment process to 
focus more closely on the low dose of ritonavir given 
concomitantly with lopinavir in the Kaletra co-formulation. 
In line with the Guideline on Summary of Product 
Characteristics information on interactions that are not 
non-recommended had been moved from section 4.4 to 
section 4.5 only.

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit risk balance of remains positive 
but that its safety profile should be closely monitored for 
the following reasons: 
The salient aspects of the safety profile of Kaletra remain 
lipid disorders, hepatotoxicity and, probably more 
pronounced than in some other Protease Inhibitors, 
pancreatitis. 
The following adverse reactions should continue to be 
closely monitored: pancreatitis, hepatic events, 
hypersensitivity and allergic reactions, lipid disorders and 
clinical events potentially attributable to hyperlipidaemia, 
bone disorders, acute renal failure and renal insufficiency 
particularly in case of concomitant tenofovir use or 
dehydration, lipodystrophy, pregnancy and congenital 
disorders. In addition, thrombocytopenia, hallucination and 
eye disorders should be put under monitoring. 
Also, there is the constant need to carefully control the 
emergence of new resistance patterns for Kaletra and an 
associated virological failure as well as the possible cross-
resistance to other Protease Inhibitors. Therefore, based on 
Page 51/56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the safety profile of Kaletra, the CHMP concluded that the 
MAH should submit one additional renewal application for 
Kaletra in 5 years time.

propionate- ritonavir interaction.  To support this 
interaction, the MAH previously provided the results of one 
multiple-dose crossover design clinical study in healthy 
subjects, conducted by GSK in July- October 2002 (Study 
FNM 10004).  This study aimed at evaluating the effects of 
several CYP3A4 inhibitors, including ritonavir, ketoconazole 
and erythromycin on systemic concentrations of fluticasone 
after nasal inhalation.

Study FNM10004 (GSK):  Fluticasone propionate aqueous 
nasal spray, 200µg once daily was administered alone for 7 
days (n=18) as well as co-administered for 7 days with 
ritonavir 100 mg twice daily (n=11); there was at least a 
14 day washout between treatment arms. Plasma 
fluticasone concentrations were below the limit of 
quantification of the fluticasone assay in most subjects 
(61%) when fluticasone was administered for 7 days alone; 
additionally, plasma cortisol concentrations over 24 h were 
not significantly affected from baseline. When fluticasone 
concentrations were detectable (n=7), geometric mean

Cmax was 11.9 pg/ml (range 11.0 to 13.0) and geometric 
mean AUC24 was equal to 8.43 pg.h/ml (range from 3.15 
to 22.6 pg·h/ml). After 7 days of ritonavir co administration 
(n=11), fluticasone mean Cmax was 318 pg/ml (range 224 
to 451 pg/mL) and AUC24 was 3103 pg·h/ml (range 2252 
to 4275 pg·h/ml). These significant increases in fluticasone 
exposure resulted in a corresponding decrease in cortisol 
plasma exposure [86% decrease [90% CI of 82 to 89%] in 
cortisol AUC24].  
Immune reactivation syndrome 
In patients treated with any type of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment. 
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not been detected/ 
diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of CART, the 
treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually 
given priority. In particular, this is true for the 
complications most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, 
generalised mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia. An additional reason for treating the OI 
and the HIV-infection sequentially is the great risk of 
adverse events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug 
interactions.

exposures using soft capsule doses for children (and based 
on BSA ranges) were provided assuming that a proportional 
increase in lopinavir concentrations is observed with 
change in dose when maintaining a 4:1 ratio of 
lopinavir/ritonavir. Underdosing of Kaletra likely carries 
more risk than in case of producing higher exposures. It is 
however unclear what the lower bound of acceptable 
lopinavir exposures are in children. Therapeutic drug 
monitoring may be useful to ensure adequate lopinavir 
exposures in an individual patient.

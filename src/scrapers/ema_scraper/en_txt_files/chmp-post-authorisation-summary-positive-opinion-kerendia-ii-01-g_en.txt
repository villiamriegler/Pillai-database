The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. For 
information, the full indications for Kerendia will therefore be as follows:2 
Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with 
albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes in adults.

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of

the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

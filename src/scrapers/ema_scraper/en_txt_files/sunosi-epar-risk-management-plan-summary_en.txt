SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SUNOSI 
(SOLRIAMFETOL)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Sunosi. The RMP details important 
risks of Sunosi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Sunosi's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Sunosi's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package  leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Sunosi should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Sunosi should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Sunosi's 
RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Sunosi is authorised for improving wakefulness and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in 
adult patients with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) or obstructive sleep apnoea whose 
EDS has not been satisfactorily treated by primary OSA therapy, such  as continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains solriamfetol as the active 
substance and it is given orally.  
Further information about the evaluation of Sunosi’s benefits can be found in Sunosi’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage <https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/sunosi >. 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES 
TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Sunosi, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Sunosi's risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment - so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Sunosi is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Sunosi are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Sunosi. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk: Serious Cardiovascular (CV) Events 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The general patient population with narcolepsy or OSA may be at risk for 
serious CV events due to certain intrinsic factors such as age, obesity, and 
comorbid cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, as well as underlying 
disease pathophysiology. CV adverse events were of interest because of 
observations of modest, reversible increases in HR and BP. 
Patients with narcolepsy and OSA may be at risk for CV events due to 
certain intrinsic risk factors, such as increasing age, obesity, concurrent 
diabetes mellitus, concurrent CV disease, and smoking.  
Patients with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure.

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Other risk groups include patients using concomitant medications that 
increase heart rate and blood pressure. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: SmPC sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 
and corresponding PIL sections 
Additional risk minimisation measures: None 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Long-term safety PASS for OSA 
patients.

development plan. 
Important Potential Risk: Serious Psychiatric Events 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Psychiatric adverse events were of interest because psychiatric 
comorbidities are common in narcolepsy and OSA, and stimulants and 
wake-promoting agents have the potential to exacerbate underlying 
psychiatric conditions. 
Psychiatric disorders are a frequent comorbidity in patients with 
narcolepsy. In OSA patients, observational studies have found a nearly 2-
fold higher incidence of depression in patients with OSA when matched to 
controls without OSA. In the Sunosi clinical development programme, 
serious psychiatric symptoms occurred more commonly in the narcolepsy 
population than the OSA population. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 and 
corresponding PIL sections 
Additional risk minimisation measures: None 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Long-term safety PASS for OSA 
patients. 
See section II. C of this summary for an overview of the post-authorisation 
development plan. 
Important Potential Risk: Potential for Abuse, Misuse and Diversion 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Sunosi meets the criteria for assessment of abuse potential as a new 
molecular entity that affects the CNS. In addition, abuse, misuse and 
diversion potential are associated with other medications used in the 
treatment of ES that are pharmacologically similar to Sunosi. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with a history of substance abuse (alcohol and /or drugs)

There are no studies that are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of 
Sunosi. 
II.C.2 
Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan 
A prospective, non-interventional, post-authorisation safety study to evaluate the long term 
safety of solriamfetol in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) treated with 
solriamfetol according to an agreed protocol. 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of the PASS will assess the risk of CV events 
among patients with OSA newly initiating treatment with Sunosi (solriamfetol) compared to 
Sunosi-unexposed patients with OSA, with or without other pharmacologic treatments to 
 
 
 
improve wakefulness, in real-world practice. Secondary objectives include collection and 
analysis of data on psychiatric events, a sensitivity analysis on the primary objective for patients 
receiving supratherapeutic doses to explore the influence of possible aberrant drug-related 
behaviours (abuse, misuse and diversion), and assessment of possible PD interactions by 
collection of data on concomitant medications as part of the primary objective and analysis of 
events of interest. 
Sunosi (solriamfetol) Pregnancy Registry: an observational study on the safety of 
solriamfetol exposure in pregnant women and their offspring 
Purpose of the study: The objective of the Sunosi (solriamfetol) Pregnancy Registry is to 
compare the maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes of women exposed to solriamfetol during 
pregnancy with outcomes in an unexposed comparator population. 
A retrospective database study to assess pregnancy outcomes associated with use of 
solriamfetol 
Purpose of the study: The goal of this project is to use existing data sources to evaluate 
pregnancy and infant outcomes. 
A Phase 4, Open-Label, Single-Dose Study to Evaluate Sunosi (solriamfetol) 
Pharmacokinetics in Breast Milk of Healthy Postpartum Women Following Oral 
Administration of Sunosi 
Purpose of the study: Primary objectives: 1) Evaluate solriamfetol pharmacokinetics (PK) in 
breast milk; 2) Estimate the daily solriamfetol dose received by the infant from the breast milk of 
the nursing mother. Secondary objective: Assess the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of 
solriamfetol in healthy postpartum women.

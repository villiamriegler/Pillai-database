Following completion of romosozumab therapy, transition to antiresorptive therapy is recommended 
in order to extend the benefit achieved with romosozumab beyond 12 months. 
Missed doses 
If the romosozumab dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be feasible. Thereafter, the next 
romosozumab dose should not be given earlier than one month after the last dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see also section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Serum calcium 
should be monitored in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment  
No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of romosozumab in paediatric patients (age <18 years) have not yet been 
established. No data are available.   
Method of administration  
Subcutaneous use  
To administer the 210 mg dose, 2 subcutaneous injections of romosozumab should be given into the 
abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The second injection should be given immediately after the first one but 
Draft 
at a different injection site. 
Administration should be performed by an individual who has been trained in injection techniques.  
For instructions on handling and disposal see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
(see section 4.4) 
Hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4) 
History of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 4.4) 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myocardial infarction and stroke 
In randomised controlled studies, an increase in serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction 
and stroke) has been observed in romosozumab treated patients compared to controls (see section 4.8).  
Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 
4.3). 
When determining whether to use romosozumab for an individual patient, consideration should be 
given to her fracture risk over the next year and her cardiovascular risk based on risk factors (e.g. 
established cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, severe 
renal impairment, age). romosozumab should only be used if the prescriber and patient agree that the 
benefit outweighs the risk. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, 
treatment with romosozumab should be discontinued.

Hypocalcaemia 
Transient hypocalcaemia has been observed in patients receiving romosozumab.  
Hypocalcaemia should be corrected prior to initiating therapy with romosozumab and patients should 
be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia. If any patient presents with suspected 
symptoms of hypocalcaemia during treatment (see section 4.8), calcium levels should be measured. 
Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).  
Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 
29 ml/min/1.73 m2) or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia and the 
safety data for these patients is limited. Calcium levels should be monitored in these patients. 
Hypersensitivity 
Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and 
urticaria occurred in the romosozumab group in clinical trials. If an anaphylactic or other clinically 
significant allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated and use of romosozumab 
should be discontinued (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), has been reported rarely in patients receiving romosozumab. The 
following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ: 
potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (the risk increases with the 
-  
antiresorptive potency of the compound), and cumulative dose of antiresorptive therapy.  
cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking.  
concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to 
head and neck.  
poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, 
invasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions.  
-  
-  
-  
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with romosozumab. 
Draft 
Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on romosozumab should receive care 
by a dentist or an oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Discontinuation of romosozumab therapy should 
be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk factors are mitigated where possible.   
Atypical femoral fractures  
Atypical low-energy or low trauma fracture of the femoral shaft, which can occur spontaneously, has 
been reported rarely in patients receiving romosozumab. Any patient who presents with new or 
unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be 
evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture 
should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of 
romosozumab therapy should be considered, based on an individual benefit-risk assessment. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say  essentially 
sodium-free. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No drug interaction studies have been performed with romosozumab. No pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions are expected with romosozumab.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Romosozumab is not indicated for use in women of child-bearing potential or in pregnant women. 
There are no data from the use of romosozumab in pregnant women. Skeletal malformations 
(including syndactyly and polydactyly) were observed at a low incidence in a single study with 
romosozumab in rats (see section 5.3). A risk for malformations of developing digits in the human 
foetus is low following romosozumab exposure due to the timing of digit formation in the first 
trimester in humans, a period when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited.  
Breast-feeding 
Romosozumab is not indicated for use in breast-feeding women. 
No data are available on excretion of romosozumab in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be 
excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations 
soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short 
period.  
Fertility 
No data are available on the effect of romosozumab on human fertility. Animal studies in female and 
male rats did not show any effects on fertility endpoints (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Romosozumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Draft 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (13.6%) and arthralgia (12.4%). 
Hypersensitivity-related reactions occurred in 6.7% of patients treated with romosozumab. 
Hypocalcaemia was reported uncommonly (0.4% of patients treated with romosozumab). In 
randomised controlled studies, an increase in serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and 
stroke) has been observed in romosozumab treated patients compared to controls (see section 4.4 and 
information below). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping and system 
organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
Draft 
In postmenopausal women dosed with monthly romosozumab, the incidence of anti-romosozumab 
antibodies was 18.6% (1162 of 6244) for binding antibodies and 0.9% (58 of 6244) for neutralizing 
antibodies. The earliest onset of anti-romosozumab antibodies was 3 months after first dosing. The 
majority of antibody responses were transient. 
The presence of anti-romosozumab binding antibodies decreased romosozumab exposure by up to 
25%. No impact on the efficacy of romosozumab was observed in the presence of antiromosozumab 
antibodies. Limited safety data show that the incidence of injection site reactions was numerically 
higher in female patients with neutralizing antibodies. 
Myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality 
In the active-controlled trial of romosozumab for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women during the 12-month double-blind romosozumab treatment phase, 16 women 
(0.8%) had myocardial infarction in the romosozumab arm versus 5 women (0.2%) in the alendronate 
arm and 13 women (0.6%) had stroke in the romosozumab arm versus 7 women (0.3%) in the 
alendronate arm. These events occurred in patients with and without a history of myocardial infarction 
or stroke. Cardiovascular death occurred in 17 women (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 12 
(0.6%) women in the alendronate group. The number of women with major adverse cardiac events 
(MACE = positively adjudicated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke) was 41 (2.0%) 
in the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) in the alendronate group, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.87 
(95% confidence interval [1.11, 3.14]) for romosozumab compared to alendronate. All-cause death 
occurred in 30 women (1.5%) in the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) women in the alendronate 
group. 
In the placebo-controlled trial of romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women (including women with severe and less severe osteoporosis) during the 12-month double-blind 
romosozumab treatment phase, there was no difference in positively adjudicated MACE; 30 (0.8%) 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred in the romosozumab group and 29 (0.8%) in the placebo group. All-cause death occurred in 
29 women (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 24 (0.7%) women in the placebo group. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose in clinical trials. There is no known antidote to romosozumab or 
specific treatment for overdose. In case of overdose, it is recommended that patients are monitored 
closely and given appropriate treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, medicinal products 
affecting bone structure and mineralization, ATC code: M05BX06. 
Mechanism of action 
Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that binds and inhibits sclerostin, thereby 
increasing bone formation due to the activation of bone lining cells, increasing bone matrix production 
Draft 
by osteoblasts, and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. Additionally, romosozumab results in changes 
to expression of osteoclast mediators, thereby decreasing bone resorption. Together, this dual effect of 
increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption results in rapid increases in trabecular and 
cortical bone mass, improvements in bone structure, and strength. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, romosozumab increased the bone formation marker 
procollagen Type 1 N terminal propeptide (P1NP) early in treatment, with a peak increase of 
approximately 145% relative to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment, followed by a return to 
placebo levels at month 9 and a decline to approximately 15% below placebo at month 12. 
Romosozumab decreased the bone resorption marker type-1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) with a 
maximal reduction of approximately 55% relative to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment. CTX 
levels remained below placebo and were approximately 25% below placebo at month 12.  
After discontinuation of romosozumab therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, P1NP 
levels returned to baseline within 12 months; CTX increased above baseline levels within 3 months 
and returned toward baseline levels by month 12, reflecting reversibility of effect. Upon retreatment 
with romosozumab (in a limited number of patients) after 12 months placebo treatment, the levels of 
increase in P1NP and decrease in CTX by romosozumab were similar to that observed during the 
initial treatment. 
Clinical trial efficacy 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women 
Efficacy and safety of romosozumab was assessed in two pivotal studies, an alendronate-controlled 
(ARCH) and a placebo-controlled study (FRAME).

Study 20110142 (ARCH) 
The efficacy and safety of romosozumab in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women 
was evaluated in a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled, 
superiority study of 4,093 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74.3 years) with 
previous fragility fractures.  
Enrolled women had either a BMD (Bone Mineral Density) T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of 
≤ −2.50, and either at least 1 moderate or severe vertebral fracture; or at least 2 mild vertebral 
fractures; or a BMD T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of ≤ -2.00, and either at least 2 moderate 
or severe vertebral fractures; or a fracture of the proximal femur that occurred within 3 to 24 months 
prior to randomization.  
The mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD T-scores were -2.96, -2.80, 
and -2.90, respectively, 96.1% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline, and 99.0% of women 
had a previous osteoporotic fracture. Women were randomized (1:1) to receive either monthly 
subcutaneous injections of romosozumab or oral weekly alendronate in a blinded fashion for 
12 months. After the 12-month double blind study period, women in both arms transitioned to 
alendronate while remaining blinded to their initial treatment. The primary analysis was performed 
when all women had completed the month 24 study visit and clinical fracture events were confirmed 
for at least 330 women and occurred after a median follow-up time of approximately 33 months on 
study. Women received calcium and vitamin D supplementation daily. 
The primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 24 and the 
incidence of clinical fracture (nonvertebral fracture and clinical vertebral fracture) at primary analysis.  
Effect on new vertebral, clinical, nonvertebral, hip and major osteoporotic fractures  
As shown in Table 1, romosozumab reduced the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 24 
Draft 
(adjusted p-value < 0.001) and the incidence of clinical fracture at primary analysis (adjusted p-value 
< 0.001) as well as the incidence of non vertebral fractures at primary analysis (adjusted p-value = 
0.040) versus treatment with alendronate alone. Table 1 also shows nonvertebral, hip and major 
osteoporotic fracture risk reduction through primary analysis, month 12 and month 24.

 Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)  
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, romosozumab for 12 months followed by alendronate 
for 12 months increased BMD compared with alendronate alone at month 12 and 24 (p-value < 0.001) 
(see Table 2).  
Following 12 months of treatment, romosozumab increased BMD at the lumbar spine from baseline in 
98% of postmenopausal women.

Study 20070337 (FRAME)  
The efficacy and safety of romosozumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was 
Draft 
evaluated in a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study of 7,180 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 70.9 years). 40.8% of 
enrolled women had severe osteoporosis with a prior fracture at baseline.  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fractures through month 12 
and through month 24.  
Romosozumab reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures through month 12 (absolute risk 
reduction: 1.3% [95% CI: 0.79; 1.80], relative risk reduction: 73% [95% CI: 53; 84], adjusted p-value 
< 0.001) and after transition to denosumab through month 24 (absolute risk reduction: 1.89 % [95% 
CI: 1.30; 2.49], relative risk reduction: 75% [95% CI: 60, 84], adjusted p-value < 0.001).  
Women transitioning from bisphosphonate therapy 
Study 20080289 (STRUCTURE) 
The safety and efficacy of romosozumab in postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis 
transitioning from bisphosphonate therapy (92.7% in teriparatide group and 88.1% in romosozumab 
group had prior alendronate use during the last 3 years) were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, 
open-label study of 436 postmenopausal women aged 56 to 90 years (mean age of 71.5 years) versus 
teriparatide. 
The primary efficacy variable was percent change in total hip BMD from baseline at month 12. 
Romosozumab significantly increased BMD at the total hip relative to teriparatide at month 12 (mean 
treatment difference from Teriparatide: 3.4% [95% CI: 2.8; 4.0], p-value < 0.0001). The trial was not 
intended to estimate the effect on fractures but there were seven fractures in the romosozumab arm and 
nine fractures in the teriparatide arm of the study.

Bone Histology and Histomorphometry 
In a bone histology sub-study, a total of 154 transiliac crest bone biopsy specimens were obtained 
from 139 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at months 2 and 12 (in FRAME study). 
Qualitative histology assessments showed normal bone architecture and quality at all time points, 
normal lamellar bone with no evidence of mineralization defects, woven bone, marrow fibrosis, or 
clinically significant marrow abnormality in patients treated with romosozumab. 
Histomorphometry assessments on biopsies at months 2 and 12 in women showed an increase of bone 
formation parameters and a decrease in bone resorption parameters while bone volume and trabecular 
thickness were increased in romosozumab group compared to placebo group.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
romosozumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of osteoporosis. 
See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.

The median time to maximum romosozumab concentration (tmax) was 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days). 
Following a 210 mg subcutaneous dose, bioavailability was 81%. 
Biotransformation 
Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2) with high affinity and specificity for 
sclerostin, and therefore is cleared via a rapid saturable elimination pathway (i.e. target mediated 
Draft 
nonlinear clearance, mediated by degradation of the romosozumab-sclerostin complex) and via a slow 
nonspecific elimination pathway mediated by the reticuloendothelial system. 
Elimination 
After Cmax, serum levels declined with a mean effective half-life of 12.8 days. Steady-state was 
generally reached by month 3 with less than 2-fold accumulation following monthly dosing.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Following subcutaneous administration, romosozumab exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics as a 
result of binding to sclerostin. Multiple doses administered ranged from 70 to 210 mg. 
Renal impairment 
Following a 210 mg dose of romosozumab in a clinical trial of 16 patients with severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving 
haemodialysis, mean Cmax and AUC were 29% and 44% higher in patients with severe renal 
impairment as compared to healthy subjects. Mean romosozumab exposure was similar in patients 
with ESRD receiving haemodialysis as compared to healthy subjects.  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab exposure with increasing 
severity of renal impairment. However, based on an exposure-response model of BMD changes and 
comparison to exposures obtained at tolerated clinical doses, no dose adjustment is recommended in 
these patients. Monitoring of hypocalcemia in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving 
dialysis is recommended (see section 4.4). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment. Hepatic 
impairment is not expected to impact on the pharmacokinetics of romosozumab since the liver is not a 
major organ for romosozumab metabolism or excretion. 
Elderly  
The pharmacokinetics of romosozumab were not affected by age from 20 years to 89 years. 
Bodyweight 
Romosozumab exposure decreased with increasing body weight however this decrease had a minimal 
impact on lumbar spine BMD gain based on exposure-response analysis and is not clinically 
meaningful. Based on population PK analyses, the expected median steady state AUC for a 61 kg and 
114 kg patient is 558 µg.day/ml and 276 µg.day/ml respectively following a monthly subcutaneous 
dose of 210 mg romosozumab. 
Ethnicity and gender 
No dose adjustment is necessary for any patient characteristics. Based on a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, gender and race (Japanese versus non-Japanese) had no clinically 
meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of romosozumab (< 20% change in exposure at steady 
state).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential or in bone safety studies. 
Draft 
In a carcinogenicity study, doses up to 50 mg/kg/week were administered by subcutaneous injection to 
Sprague-Dawley male and female rats from 8 weeks of age for up to 98 weeks. These doses resulted in 
systemic exposures that were up to 19 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans 
following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison). 
Romosozumab caused a dose-dependent increase in bone mass with macroscopic bone thickening at 
all doses. There were no effects of romosozumab on mortality or tumor incidence in male or female 
rats.  
Studies in female and male rats did not show any romosozumab-related effects on mating, fertility, or 
male reproductive assessments (sperm parameters or organ weights), and there were no effects on 
estrous cycling or any ovarian or uterine parameters at exposures around 54 times the clinical 
exposure. 
Skeletal malformations, including syndactyly and polydactyly, were observed at a low incidence in 1 
out of 75 litters at exposures around 30 times the clinical exposure following administration of 
romosozumab to rats during the period of organogenesis. There were no adverse effects on postnatal 
growth and development.   
Sclerostin has been suggested to have a role in digit formation, however, as digit formation in the 
human occurs in the first trimester when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited, the risk of a 
similar finding in humans is low (see section 4.6).

1.  What EVENITY is and what it is used for 
What EVENITY is 
EVENITY contains the active substance romosozumab, a medicine that helps to make the bones 
stronger, and reduce the risk of broken bones.  
What EVENITY is used for 
EVENITY is used to treat severe osteoporosis in women after the menopause who are at high risk of 
broken bone (fracture).  
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile. Many patients with 
osteoporosis have no symptoms, but they may be at increased risk of fractures.  
How EVENITY works 
EVENITY is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that has been 
designed to recognize and attach to specific proteins in the body. EVENITY attaches to a protein 
called sclerostin. By attaching to and blocking the activity of sclerostin, EVENITY:  
• 
• 
This makes the bones stronger, and lowers the risk of fractures. 
helps to form new bone, and 
slows down the loss of existing bone. 
2.  What you need to know before you use EVENITY 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use EVENITY if 
• 
you are allergic to romosozumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
you have low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia). Your doctor will be able to tell 
you if your levels are too low; 
you have a history of heart attack or stroke. 
• 
• 
Do not use EVENITY if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using EVENITY. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist and discuss your medical history before using EVENITY. 
Heart attack and stroke 
Heart attack and stroke have been reported in people receiving EVENITY.  
Seek medical attention straight away if you get: 
• 
• 
chest pain, shortness of breath; 
headache, numbness, or weakness in your face, arms, or legs, difficulty talking, changes in 
vision, loss of balance. 
Your doctor will carefully evaluate the risk of cardiovascular problems before he/she lets you start 
treatment with EVENITY. Tell your doctor if you know that you have an increased risk of 
cardiovascular problems such as established cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high blood 
fat levels, diabetes, smoking or kidney problems.   
Low levels of calcium in the blood 
EVENITY may cause low levels of calcium in your blood.  
Tell your doctor if you notice: 
• 
• 
Draft 
spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles; 
numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth.  
Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to help prevent low calcium levels in your blood 
before you start your treatment and while you take EVENITY. Take calcium and vitamin D as your 
doctor tells you to.  
Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed 
dialysis as this may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do not take calcium 
supplements. 
Serious allergic reactions 
Serious allergic reactions can happen to people who use EVENITY.  
Seek medical attention straight away if you get: 
• 
• 
swelling of the face, mouth, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs (angioedema), or hives; 
acute skin eruption showing multiple round, red/pink spots with a blistering or crusting centre 
(erythema multiforme); 
difficulty in swallowing or breathing. 
• 
Problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely 
(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving EVENITY. ONJ can also occur after 
stopping treatment. It is important to try to prevent ONJ developing, as it may be a painful condition 
that can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing ONJ, there are some precautions 
you should take. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before receiving EVENITY, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
• 
have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction; 
do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; 
are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); 
have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders, 
such as osteoporosis); 
are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone); 
have cancer. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with EVENITY. 
While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. If 
you wear dentures, you should make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or will 
undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell 
your dentist that you are being treated with EVENITY. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you get any problems with your mouth or teeth such 
as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
loose teeth; 
pain or swelling; 
mouth sores that do not heal; 
discharge. 
Unusual thigh bone fractures 
People who have used EVENITY rarely developed unusual fractures of the thigh bone caused by little 
or no trauma. These fracture types are often preceded by warning signs of thigh or groin pain for 
several weeks before the fracture occurs. It is not known whether EVENITY caused these unusual 
fractures. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you get any new or unusual pains in your hip, groin or 
thigh.  
Draft 
Children and adolescents 
The use of romosozumab in children and adolescents has not been studied and it is not approved for 
use in paediatric patients (age <18 years). 
Other medicines and EVENITY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
EVENITY is only intended to treat women after menopause.  
EVENITY should not be used by women of child-bearing potential, or when pregnant or breast-
feeding. It is not known whether EVENITY may harm an unborn or breast-fed child.  
Contact your doctor if you have any questions. 
Driving and using machines 
EVENITY is expected to have no effect or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. 
EVENITY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

3. 
How to use EVENITY 
EVENITY will be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the management of 
osteoporosis. Always use this medicine exactly as you doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if 
you are not sure. 
The injection should only be given by a person who has been properly trained.  
How much to use 
• 
• 
The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg. 
Since one pre-filled pen contains 105 mg of the active substance romosozumab in 1.17 ml of 
solution (90mg/ml), 2 pre-filled pens must be used for each dose. The second injection must be 
given immediately after the first one but at a different injection site.   
Do this once every month for 12 months. 
How to use 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
EVENITY has to be injected under the skin (sub-cutaneous injection). 
EVENITY should be injected in either the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh. The outer area of 
your upper arm can also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the 
injection.   
If the same injection area is planned to be used for the second injection, a different injection 
spot should be used.  
EVENITY should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.  
It is important that you read the Instructions for Use for detailed information on how to use the 
EVENITY pre-filled pen.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any further questions on the use of the medicine.  
If you use more EVENITY than you should 
If, by mistake, you have used more EVENITY than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
Draft 
If you forget to use or cannot take EVENITY at your usual time 
If you miss a dose of EVENITY, contact your doctor as soon as possible to schedule another dose. 
Thereafter, the next dose should be given not earlier than one month after the date of the last dose.  
If you stop taking EVENITY 
If you are considering stopping EVENITY treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor 
will advise you on how long you should be treated with EVENITY. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Discuss with your doctor the need to switch to another osteoporosis treatment after the end of your 
treatment with EVENITY.

Step 1:  Prepare 
A 
•  Take the carton containing the two pre-filled pens out of the refrigerator. 
•  Your pre-filled pens should be left outside the refrigerator to reach room temperature (up to 25°C) 
for at least 30 minutes before injection (do not warm in any other way). This will make the 
injection more comfortable. 
•  Open the carton and gather all materials you need for the injection (as listed in Step B). 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly. 
•  Lift the pre-filled pens straight up out of the carton − do not remove the white caps from the pre-
filled pens yet. 
•  Do not shake the pre-filled pens. 
•  Check the medicine through the viewing window. The medicine should be a clear to opalescent,  
colourless to light yellow solution. 
-  Do not use the pre-filled pens if the solution is discoloured, cloudy, or contains flakes or 
particles. 
-  You may see air bubbles. Injecting the solution subcutaneously (under the skin) which  
contains air bubbles is harmless. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled pens if: 
- 
- 
- 
it has been dropped; 
the white cap is missing or not securely attached; 
the seal is missing or broken or if any other part appears cracked or broken. 
In such case, use a new pen and contact your doctor as soon as possible. 
B  On a clean, well-lit work surface, place: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
two pre-filled pens; 
two alcohol wipes; 
two cotton balls or gauze pads; 
two adhesives bandages; 
special disposal container. 
Draft 
C  Prepare and clean the skin where you are going to inject the medicine. You can choose from: 
• 
• 
• 
the thighs; 
the stomach area (abdomen), but not the 5 cm area 
around the belly button; 
the outer area of the upper arm (if someone else is 
giving you the injection). 
Outer area of  
upper arm 
Stomach area    
(abdomen) 
Thigh 
•  The second injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If 
you wish to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, has scars, or stretch marks, or 
has raised thick, red, or scaly skin patches or lesions.  
•  Clean the area you are going to inject with an alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry before the injection. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Do not touch this area again before injecting. 
D 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Step 2:  Get ready 
Pull the white cap straight off just before the injection.  
Once the cap is removed, the injection must be given within 5 minutes. There is no need to rush 
the injection - 5 minutes is enough time. 
Do not twist or bend the white cap. 
Discard the white cap in the special disposal container. Do not place the white cap back onto 
the pre-filled pen.

Do not throw away (dispose of) the pre-filled pen in the household waste. 
Do not re-use the pre-filled pen. 
Important: Always keep the special disposal container out of the sight and reach of children. 
Step 5:  Examine the injection site 
J 
If there is blood, use a cotton ball or a piece of gauze and apply light pressure over the injection site for 
a few seconds. Do not rub the injection site. The injection site can be covered with a small adhesive 
bandage, if necessary. 
Step 6:  Repeat for the second injection to get the full dose 
K 
Repeat all steps starting from step C with the second pre-filled pen to inject the full dose. The second 
injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If you wish to use 
the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot.

1.  What EVENITY is and what it is used for 
What EVENITY is 
EVENITY contains the active substance romosozumab, a medicine that helps to make the bones 
stronger, and reduce the risk of broken bones.  
What EVENITY is used for 
EVENITY is used to treat severe osteoporosis in women after the menopause who are at high risk of 
broken bone (fracture).  
Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and fragile. Many patients with 
osteoporosis have no symptoms, but they may be at increased risk of fractures.  
How EVENITY works 
EVENITY is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that has been 
designed to recognize and attach to specific proteins in the body. EVENITY attaches to a protein 
called sclerostin. By attaching to and blocking the activity of sclerostin, EVENITY:  
• 
• 
This makes the bones stronger, and lowers the risk of fractures. 
helps to form new bone, and 
slows down the loss of existing bone. 
2.  What you need to know before you use EVENITY  
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use EVENITY if: 
• 
you are allergic to romosozumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
you have low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia). Your doctor will be able to tell 
you if your levels are too low; 
you have history of heart attack or stroke. 
• 
• 
Do not use EVENITY if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using EVENITY. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist and discuss your medical history before using EVENITY. 
Heart attack and stroke 
Heart attack and stroke have been reported in people receiving EVENITY.  
Seek medical attention straight away if you get: 
• 
• 
chest pain, shortness of breath; 
headache, numbness, or weakness in your face, arms, or legs, difficulty talking, changes in 
vision, loss of balance. 
Your doctor will carefully evaluate the risk of cardiovascular problems before he/she lets you start 
treatment with EVENITY. Tell your doctor if you know that you have an increased risk of 
cardiovascular problems such as established cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high blood 
fat levels, diabetes, smoking or kidney problems.   
Low levels of calcium in the blood 
EVENITY may cause low levels of calcium in your blood.  
Tell your doctor if you notice: 
• 
• 
Draft 
spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles;  
numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or around your mouth.  
Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to help prevent low calcium levels in your blood 
before you start your treatment and while you take EVENITY. Take calcium and vitamin D as your 
doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had severe kidney problems, kidney 
failure or have needed dialysis as this may increase your risk of getting low blood calcium if you do 
not take calcium supplements.  
Serious allergic reactions 
Serious allergic reactions can happen to people who use EVENITY.  
Seek medical attention straight away if you get: 
• 
• 
swelling of the face, mouth, throat, hands, feet, ankles, lower legs (angioedema), or hives; 
acute skin eruption showing multiple round, red/pink spots with a blistering or crusting centre 
(erythema multiforme); 
difficulty in swallowing or breathing. 
• 
Problems with your mouth, teeth or jaw 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported rarely 
(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) in patients receiving EVENITY. ONJ can also occur after 
stopping treatment. It is important to try to prevent ONJ developing as it may be a painful condition 
that can be difficult to treat. In order to reduce the risk of developing ONJ, there are some precautions 
you should take. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before receiving EVENITY, tell your doctor or nurse if you: 
• 
have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction; 
do not receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check-up for a long time; 
are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems); 
have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders, 
such as osteoporosis); 
are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone); 
have cancer. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before you start treatment with EVENITY. 
While being treated, you should maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. If 
you wear dentures, you should make sure these fit properly. If you are under dental treatment or will 
undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor about your dental treatment and tell 
your dentist that you are being treated with EVENITY. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you get any problems with your mouth or teeth such 
as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
loose teeth; 
pain or swelling; 
mouth sores that do not heal; 
discharge. 
Unusual thigh bone fractures 
People who have used EVENITY, rarely developed unusual fractures of the thigh bone  caused by 
little or no trauma. These fracture types are often proceded by warning signs of thigh or groin pain for 
Draft 
several weeks before the fracture occurs. It is not known whether EVENITY caused these unusual 
fractures. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you get any new or unusual pains in your hip, groin or 
thigh.  
Children and adolescents 
The use of romosozumab in children and adolescents has not been studied and it is not approved for 
use in paediatric patients (age <18 years). 
Other medicines and EVENITY 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
EVENITY is only intended to treat women after menopause.  
EVENITY should not be used by women of child-bearing potential, or when pregnant or breast-
feeding. It is not known whether EVENITY may harm an unborn or breast-fed child.  
Contact your doctor if you have any questions. 
Driving and using machines 
EVENITY is expected to have no effect or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines. 
EVENITY contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium- 
free’. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use EVENITY 
EVENITY will be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the management of 
osteoporosis. Always use this medicine exactly as you doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if 
you are not sure. 
The injection should only be given by a person who has been properly trained.  
How much to use 
• 
• 
The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg. 
Since one pre-filled syringe contains 105 mg of the active substance romosozumab, 2 pre-filled 
syringes must be used for each dose. The second injection must be given immediately after the 
first one but at a different injection site.   
Do this once every month for 12 months.  
How to use 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
EVENITY has to be injected under the skin (sub-cutaneous injection). 
EVENITY should be injected in either the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh. The outer area of 
your upper arm can also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the 
injection.   
If the same injection area is planned to be used for the second injection, a different injection 
spot should be used.  
EVENITY should not be injected into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.  
It is important that you read the Instructions for Use for detailed information on how to use the 
EVENITY pre-filled syringe.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any further questions on the use of the medicine.  
Draft 
If you use more EVENITY than you should 
If, by mistake, you have used more EVENITY than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you forget to use or cannot take EVENITY at your usual time 
If you miss a dose of EVENITY, contact your doctor as soon as possible to schedule another dose. 
Thereafter, the next dose should be given not earlier than one month after the date of the last dose.  
If you stop taking EVENITY 
If you are considering stopping EVENITY treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor 
will advise you on how long you should be treated with EVENITY. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

STOP 
Read this before the medicine is injected. 
Your healthcare provider has prescribed a dose of 
210 mg every month dose: To receive your full dose, 
two 105 mg pre-filled syringes should be injected, 
one immediately after the other. 
1 dose 
Step 1:  Prepare 
A 
•  Take the carton containing the two pre-filled syringes out of the refrigerator. 
•  Your pre-filled syringes should be left outside the refrigerator to reach room temperature (up to 
25°C) for at least 30 minutes before injection (do not warm in any other way). This will make 
the injection more comfortable. 
•  Open the carton and gather all the materials you need for the injection (as listed in Step B). 
•  Wash your hands thoroughly. 
•  Remove two pre-filled syringes from the carton as shown in the picture. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Important: Always hold the pre-filled syringes by the syringe barrel. 
•  Place finger or thumb on edge of tray to secure it while you remove the pre-filled syringes.  
•  Grab the syringe barrel to remove the pre-filled syringes from the tray. 
Grab Here 
•  Do not grasp the plunger rod or the grey needle cap. 
•  Do not remove the grey cap from the pre-filled syringes yet. 
•  Do not remove the finger flange. This is part of the pre-filled syringe. 
•  Do not shake the pre-filled syringes. 
•  Check the medicine in the syringes. The medicine should be a clear to opalescent, colourless to 
light yellow solution. 
- 
- 
  Do not use the pre-filled syringes if the solution is discoloured, cloudy, or contains 
flakes or particles. 
  You may see air bubbles. Injecting the solution subcutaneously (under the skin) 
which contains air bubbles is harmless. 
Draft 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if: 
- 
- 
- 
it has been dropped; 
if the grey needle cap is missing or not securely attached; 
if the seal is missing or broken or if any part appears cracked or broken. 
In such case, use a new syringe and contact your doctor as soon as possible.  
B  On a clean, well-lit work surface, place: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
two pre-filled syringes; 
two alcohol wipes; 
two cotton balls or gauze pads; 
two adhesives bandages; 
special disposal container. 
C  Prepare and clean the skin where you are going to inject the medicine. You can choose from: 
• 
• 
• 
the thighs; 
the stomach area (abdomen), but not the 5 cm area 
around the belly button; 
the outer area of the upper arm (if someone else is 
giving you the injection).

•  The second injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If 
you wish to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot. 
•  Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, has scars, or stretch marks, or 
has raised thick, red, or scaly skin patches or lesions 
•  Clean the area you are going to inject with an alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry before the injection. 
•  Do not touch this area again before injecting. 
Step 2:  Get ready 
D 
•  Pull the grey needle cap straight off and away from the body just before the injection.  
- 
Take care not to touch the needle or let the needle touch any surface.  
•  Once the cap is removed, the injection must be given within 5 minutes. There is no need to rush 
the injection - 5 minutes is enough time. 
- 
It is normal to see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. 
Draft 
•  Do not twist or bend the grey needle cap. 
•  Discard the grey needle cap in the special disposal container. Do not place the grey needle cap 
back onto the pre-filled syringe. 
E  •  Pinch skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, creating a firm surface about 5 cm wide. 
• 
Important: Keep the skin pinched while injecting. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Inject 
F  • 
Important: The plunger rod should not be pushed down until the actual injection is ready to be 
performed. 
•  The pinch should be held. With the other hand, the pre-filled syringe’s needle should be inserted 
into the area of the skin that previously has been cleaned (the “injection site”) at a 45 to 
90° degree angle. 
•  Finger should not be placed on the plunger rod while inserting the needle. 
G  •  Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod all the way down until it stops moving 
indicating the entire dose has been delivered. The pre-filled syringe should be kept in the skin 
while completing the dose delivery. 
Draft 
H  •  Once complete, release your thumb and gently lift the pre-filled syringe off the skin at the same 
angle at which it was inserted. 
-  After you remove the pre-filled syringe from the skin, the syringe barrel should be empty. 
• 
Important: If it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this means you have not 
delivered a full injection. Your healthcare provider should be informed as soon as possible.

I 
•  Discard the entire used pre-filled syringe and the grey needle 
cap in a special container straight away after use. 
•  Do not throw away (dispose of) the pre-filled syringe in the household waste. 
•  Do not re-use the pre-filled syringe. 
• 
Important: Always keep the special disposal container out of the sight and reach of children. 
Step 5:  Examine the injection site 
J 
If there is blood, use a cotton ball or piece of gauze and apply light pressure over the injection site 
for a few seconds. Do not rub the injection site. The injection site can be covered with a small 
adhesive bandage, if necessary. 
Step 6:  Repeat for the second injection to get the full dose 
K 
Repeat all steps starting from step C with the second pre-filled syringe to inject the full dose. The 
second injection should be given on a different site than the one used for the first injection. If you 
wish to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the exact same injection spot.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Cufence is indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in patients intolerant to D-Penicillamine 
therapy, in adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years or older. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the management of 
Wilson’s disease. 
Posology 
The starting dose would usually correspond to the lowest recommended dose and the dose should 
subsequently be adapted according to the patient’s clinical response (see section 4.4). 
The recommended dose is 800 – 1 600 mg daily in 2 to 4 divided doses. 
The recommended doses of Cufence are expressed as mg of trientine base (i.e. not in mg of the 
trientine dihydrochloride salt) (see section 4.4).

Elderly 
There is insufficient clinical information available for Cufence to determine whether there exist 
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection should be 
cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range as recommended for adults, reflecting the 
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other 
drug therapy.  
Renal impairment 
There is limited information in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, the recommended dose in 
patients with renal impairment is the same as for adults. For specific precautions see section 4.4. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is limited information in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, the recommended dose in 
patients with hepatic impairment is the same as for adults. For specific precautions see section 4.4. 
Patients primarily presenting hepatic symptoms 
The recommended dose in patients primarily presenting hepatic symptoms is the same as the 
recommended adult dose.  It is advised, however, to monitor patients presenting with hepatic 
symptoms every two to three weeks after initiation of treatment with Cufence. 
Patients primarily presenting neurological symptoms 
Dose recommendations are the same as for adults. However, up titration should be done with 
moderation and consideration, and adapted according to the patient’s clinical response such as 
worsening of tremor as patients could be at risk of neurological deterioration at initiation of treatment 
(see section 4.4). It is further advised to monitor patients presenting with neurological symptoms every 
one to two weeks after initiation of treatment with Cufence until target dose is reached. 
Paediatric population 
The dose is lower than for adults and depends on age and body weight. The dose should be adjusted 
according to clinical response; 400 – 1 000 mg have been used at initiation of therapy (see 
section 4.4). 
Children < 5 years  
The safety and efficacy of Cufence in children aged 0 to 5 years have not yet been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
For oral use.  
Capsules should be swallowed whole with water.  
It is important that Cufence is given on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals or two hours 
after meals, and at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product, food or milk (see 
section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When switching a patient from another trientine formulation, caution is advised because different 
trientine salts are available which may have a different trientine content (base) and a different 
bioavailability. Dose adjustment may be required (see section 4.2).   
Trientine is a chelating agent which has been found to reduce serum iron levels. Iron supplementation 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be necessary in some cases. Concomitant oral iron should be administred at a different time than 
trientine (see section 4.5). 
The combination of trientine with zinc is not recommended. There are only limited data on 
concomitant use available and no specific dose recommendations can be made. 
There is no evidence that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine but it is 
recommended to separate their administration (see section 4.5). 
In patients who were previously treated with D-Penicillamine, lupus-like reactions have been reported 
during subsequent treatment with trientine, however it is not possible to determine if there is a causal 
relationship with trientine. 
Monitoring 
Patients receiving Cufence should remain under regular medical supervision and be monitored using 
all available clinical data for appropriate control of clinical symptoms and copper levels in order to 
optimise treatment. Frequency of monitoring is recommended to be at least twice a year. More 
frequent monitoring is advised during the initial phase of treatment and during phases of disease 
progression or when dose adjustments are made as to be decided by the treating physician (see 
section 4.2).  
The aim of maintenance treatment is to maintain free copper levels in plasma (also known as non-
ceruloplasmin plasma copper) and the urinary copper excretion within the acceptable limits.  
The determination of serum free copper, calculated using the difference between the total copper and 
the ceruloplasmin-bound copper (normal level of free copper in the serum is usually 100 to 
150 microgram/L), can be a useful index for monitoring therapy. 
The measurement of copper excretion in the urine may be performed during therapy. Since chelation 
therapy leads to an increase in urinary copper levels, this may/will not give an accurate reflection of 
the excess copper load in the body but may be a useful measure of treatment compliance. 
The use of appropriate copper parameter target ranges is described in clinical practice guidelines 
related to Wilson’s disease. 
Like with all anti-copper agents, overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is 
especially harmful for children and pregnant women (see section 4.6) since copper is required for 
proper growth and mental development. Therefore, monitoring for manifestations of overtreatment 
should be undertaken. 
Patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment receiving trientine should remain under regular medical 
supervision for appropriate control of symptoms and copper levels. Close monitoring of renal and/or 
liver function is also recommended in these patients (see section 4.2). 
Worsening of neurological symptoms may occur at the beginning of chelation therapy due to excess of 
free serum copper during the initial response to treatment. It is possible that this effect may be more 
evident in patients with pre-existing neurological symptoms. It is recommended to monitor patients 
closely for such signs and symptoms and to consider careful titration to reach the recommended 
therapeutic dose and to reduce dose when necessary.  
Dose adjustments in the trientine dose should be considered in case of signs of reduced efficacy such 
as (persistent) increase in liver enzymes, and worsening of tremor. When trientine doses are adjusted 
this should be done in small steps. The trientine dose may also be reduced in case of side effects of 
trientine, such as gastrointestinal complaints and haematological changes. Trientine doses should be 
reduced to a more tolerable dose and may be increased again, once side effects have been resolved.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
Zinc 
There are insufficient data to support the concomitant use of zinc and trientine. The combination of 
trientine with zinc is not recommended as interaction of zinc with trientine is likely, thereby reducing 
the effect of both active substances. 
Other anti-copper agents 
No interaction studies have been performed on the concomitant administration of trientine with 
D-Penicillamine. 
Food 
Trientine is poorly absorbed following oral intake and food further inhibits trientine absorption. 
Specific food interaction studies have been performed with trientine in healthy subjects, showing a 
reduction of the extent of absorption of trientine up to 45%. Systemic exposure is critical for its 
principal mechanism of action, copper chelation (see section 5.1). Therefore, it is recommended that 
trientine is taken at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals and at least one hour apart from 
any other medicinal product, food, or milk to allow for maximum absorption and reduce the likelihood 
of the formation of complexes by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.2). 
Other products 
Trientine has been found to reduce serum iron levels. Therefore, iron supplementation may be 
necessary in some cases. Concomitant oral iron or other heavy metals should be administred at a 
different time than trientine to prevent the formation of complexes (see section 4.4). 
Although there is no evidence that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine, it is 
good practice to separate their administration (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of trientine in pregnant women.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity, which was probably a result of trientine-induced 
copper deficiency (see section 5.3). 
Trientine should be used in pregnancy only after careful consideration of the benefits compared with 
the risks of discontinuing treatment in the individual patient. Factors to consider include the known 
risks associated with untreated or undertreated Wilson’s disease, risks associated with the stage of 
disease, the risk of those alternative treatments which are available and the possible effects of trientine 
(see section 5.3).  
If treatment with trientine is to be continued following a risk-benefit analysis, consideration should be 
given to reducing the dose of trientine to the lowest effective dose and monitoring compliance with the 
treatment regimen. 
The pregnancy should be closely monitored in order to detect possible foetal abnormality and to assess 
maternal serum copper levels throughout the pregnancy. The dose of trientine used should be adjusted 
in order to maintain serum copper levels within the normal range. Since copper is required for proper 
growth and mental development, dose adjustments may be required to ensure that the foetus will not 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
become copper deficient and close monitoring of the patient is essential (see section 4.4) 
Babies born to mothers being treated with trientine should be monitored for serum copper and 
ceruloplasmin levels where appropriate. 
Breast-feeding 
There is limited clinical data suggesting that trientine is not excreted in breast milk. However, a risk to 
the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
trientine therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
It is unknown whether trientine has an effect on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Trientine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Nausea can commonly occur on initial treatment and occasionally skin rash can occur. Duodenitis and 
severe colitis have been reported. Neurological deterioration can occur at the start of the treatment.

There have been reports of neurological deterioration at the start of treatment in Wilson’s disease 
patients treated with copper chelators including trientine, with symptoms of, for example, dystonia, 
rigidity, tremor and dysarthria (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
Clinical trials with Cufence including a limited number of children in the age range of 5 to 17 years at 
the start of treatment indicate that frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are 
expected to be the same as in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to 
report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Occasional cases of trientine overdose have been reported. In cases up to 20 g of trientine base there 
were no apparent adverse effects reported. A large overdose of 40 g of trientine base resulted in self-
limiting dizziness and vomiting with no other clinical sequelae or significant biochemical 
abnormalities reported.  
In the event of overdose the patient should be observed, appropriate biochemical analysis performed 
and symptomatic treatment given. There is no antidote. 
Chronic overtreatment can lead to copper deficiency and reversible sideroblastic anaemia. 
Overtreatment and excess copper removal can be monitored using values of urine copper excretion 
and of non-ceruloplasmin bound copper. Close monitoring is required to optimise the dose or adapt 
treatment if necessary (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism, various alimentary tract and 
metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX12 
Mechanism of action 
Trientine is a copper-selective chelator that enhances systemic elimination of divalent copper by 
forming a stable complex that is readily excreted by the kidneys. Trientine is a chelator with a 
polyamine-like structure and copper is chelated by forming a stable complex with the four constituent 
nitrogens in a planar ring. Thus, the pharmacodynamic action of trientine is dependent on its chemical 
property of chelating copper and not on its interaction with receptors, enzyme systems or any other 
biological system that might differ between species. Trientine may also chelate copper in the intestinal 
tract and so inhibit copper absorption. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The bioavailability of trientine capsules in human beings has not been established. Based on 
preclinical data, the mechanism of absorption and the high first pass effect, it is expected that trientine 
bioavailability is low and highly variable following oral administration. Clinical studies showed that 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trientine is absorbed with tmax occurring between 0.5 and 6 hours post-dose in healthy volunteers and 
patients. Exposure to trientine is highly variable between subjects, with a variation of up to 60%. 
The intake of food within 30 minutes prior to trientine administration delays the time to peak 
concentrations by 2 hours and reduces the extent of absorption of trientine by approximately 45%. 
Distribution 
Trientine has low human plasma protein binding and is widely distributed in tissues with relatively 
high concentrations measured in liver, heart, and kidney in the rat.  
Biotransformation 
Trientine is acetylated in two major metabolites, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and 
N(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine (DAT). Clinical data in healthy subjects indicate that the 
plasma exposure to the MAT metabolite is approximately 3 times that of unchanged trientine, while 
exposure to the DAT metabolite is slightly lower compared to trientine. The metabolites of trientine 
have Cu-chelating properties, however the stability of these Cu-complexes is low due to the 
introduction of the acetyl groups. Clinical data in healthy volunteers suggest limited contribution of 
chelating activity by the MAT and DAT metabolites.The extent of MAT and DAT’s contribution to 
the overall effect of Cufence on copper levels in Wilson’s Disease patients remains to be determined. 
Trientine is metabolised by acetylation via spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase and not via 
N-acetyltransferase 2. 
Elimination 
After absorption trientine and its metabolites are rapidly excreted in the urine, either bound to copper 
or unbound. The unabsorbed fraction of orally administered trientine is bound to intestinal copper and 
eliminated through faecal excretion. 
The elimination half-life of trientine is approximately 4 hours (mean t1/2 of 3.8 ± 1.3 hours measured at 
steady state in WD patients and 4.4 ± 4.7 hours measured after a single dose in healthy volunteers). 
The elimination half-lives of the two metabolites were 14.1 ±  3.7 hours for MAT and 8.5 ± 3.0 hours 
for DAT after a single dose administration of trientine in healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Age /gender/body weight 
Data from clinical studies conducted in adult healthy subjects indicate that age, gender and body 
weight do not seem to influence the pharmacokinetics of trientine.  
Ethnicity 
No pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed on interethnic differences.     
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on a series of studies investigating 
cardiovascular safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to embryofoetal 
development. 
Effects in non-clinical studies were largely consistent with induced copper deficiency in the plasma 
and liver of previously copper normative animals and as such could be attributed to the 
pharmacological action of trientine. The main toxicological findings associated with trientine, which 
were generally seen across all species examined, included body weight loss or lower body weight 
gain, altered urinary electrolytes, low plasma copper levels and various histopathological changes in 
the lungs (mainly interstitial pneumonitis). All effects were reversible with the exception of the lung 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
findings; however the dose levels where these effects were observed are far in excess of those used 
clinically. Moreover, there was some doubt about the relationship to trientine, as the lung findings 
were also observed in most of the control dogs in the 26 week study. In dogs, ataxia, tremors, 
abnormal gait and underactivity were observed following administration of very high levels of 
trientine. Some functional neurological abnormalities were also identified, particularly in severly 
affected animals, however no associated nerve damage was observed. Electrocardiography was also 
unaffected. 
In pregnant animals, high dose trientine associated with significant reductions in serum copper, 
revealed an early effect on embryo survival and a marginally lower foetal weight.  There was no 
evidence of embryo-foetal toxicity at lower dose levels despite dose-related reductions in serum 
copper. These effects were observed only at exposures sufficiently in excess of maximum human 
exposure to indicate little relevance to clinical use. 
No fertility data are available but estrous cyclicity was unaffected and reproductive organs were not 
identified as target organs in general repeat dose toxicity studies.  
The OECD SIDS triethylenetetramine 2002 classifies the genotoxic profile of trientine as low 
priority/concern. Some positive in vitro mutagenicity data were obtained but in vivo test systems 
showed no mutagenic activity. No long term animal carcinogenicity trials have to date been performed 
with trientine via the oral route, but via the dermal route, there was no increases in cancers above 
baseline. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that trientine actually reduces endogenous DNA 
damage in a strain of rat (Long-Evans Cinnamon) considered to represent an appropriate model of 
Wilson’s disease. This suggests a reduced carcinogenic risk for Wilson’s disease patients as a result of 
trientine therapy. 
Trientine dihydrochloride is a known irritant, especially to mucus membranes, upper respiratory tract 
and skin, and induces skin sensitisation in guinea pigs, mice and man (OECD SIDS 
triethylenetetramine 2002).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cufence is and what it is used for 
Cufence is a medicine used for the treatment of Wilson’s disease in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 5 years or older. It is for use by patients who cannot take another medicine, D-Penicillamine, 
because of side effects. 
Cufence contains the active substance trientine, a copper-chelating agent that is used to remove excess 
of copper from the body. Cufence attaches to the copper, which is then passed from the body.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Cufence  
Do not take Cufence 
If you are allergic to trientine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling of the face, fainting and breathing 
problems. 
Warnings and precautions  
Your doctor will need to regularly check for symptoms of the disease and copper levels in your blood 
and urine. Regular monitoring is especially important at the start of your treatment or when your dose 
is changed, in growing children and pregnant women to ensure that copper levels are maintained at a 
suitable level. The doctor may need to increase or decrease your dose of Cufence.  
Nervous system problems can occur (for example, shaking, lack of coordination, slurred speech, 
muscle stiffness and worsening of muscle spasms), especially in patients just starting treatment with 
Cufence. If you notice these whilst taking Cufence, you must tell your doctor immediately. 
Lupus-like reactions (symptoms may include persistent rash, fever, joint pain, and tiredness) have 
been reported in some patients switched to trientine medicine after penicillamine medicine. However, 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it was not possible to determine if the reaction was due to trientine or to previous penicillamine 
treatment. 
Other medicines and Cufence 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If you are taking iron tablets or medicines that neutralise the acid in your stomach, leave at least 
2 hours before or after you have taken Cufence because they may reduce Cufence’s effect. 
It is recommended that trientine is taken at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product. 
Cufence with food and drink 
Take this medicine with water only. Do not take it with other drinks, milk or food because they may 
reduce the medicine’s effect. Avoid eating or drinking (except water) for 2 hours before and 1 hour 
after taking Cufence. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is very important to continue 
treatment to maintain normal copper levels during pregnancy. You and your doctor should fully 
discuss the potential benefits of treatment whilst considering any possible risks that there may be. 
Your doctor will advise you which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. If you become 
pregnant whilst taking Cufence, talk to your doctor. 
If you are pregnant and taking Cufence, you will be monitored throughout your pregnancy for any 
effects on the baby or changes in your copper levels.  
The limited information available suggests that Cufence does not pass into breast milk, but it is not 
certain that there is no risk to the baby.  It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or 
plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop taking 
Cufence, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Cufence to the 
mother. Your doctor will decide which treatment and which dose is best in your situation. 
Driving and using machines 
Trientine is not likely to have an effect on your ability to drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to take Cufence

or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Adults (including the elderly) 
The usual dose is between 800 and 1 600 mg per day, to be taken by mouth. 
Use in children and adolescents (5 to 17 years) 
In children and adolescents, the dose depends on age and body weight and will be adjusted by your 
doctor. At the start of treatment the dose varies between 400 and 1 000 mg per day. 
Method of administration 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor will decide the correct dose for you. 
The total daily dose can be divided into 2 to 4 smaller doses, as indicated by your doctor. Swallow the 
capsules whole with a drink of water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food.  
Patients who have difficulties swallowing should contact their doctor. 
If you take more Cufence than you should 
If you take more medicine than you should, you may get nausea, vomiting and dizziness. You must 
contact your doctor or another health care provider immediately. 
If you forget to take Cufence 
If you forget to take a dose take your next dose at its usual scheduled time. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Cufence 
This medicine is for long-term use because Wilson’s disease is a life-long condition. Do not stop or 
change your treatment without speaking with your doctor even if you feel better. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist

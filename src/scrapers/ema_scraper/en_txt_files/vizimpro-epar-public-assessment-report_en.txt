2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women in developed countries, and it is the 
second  leading  cause  of  cancer-related  death  in  less  developed  countries,  representing  1.6  million 
cancer-related  deaths  worldwide  annually  (GLOBOCAN  2012).  Lung  cancer  also  represents  more  patient 
cancer-related deaths than breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
represents approximately 85% of all lung cancers, and the majority of patients present with locally advanced or 
metastatic disease (Haura 2001; Greenhalgh et al 2016; Reck et al 2017). 
The developments in molecular testing techniques and targeted therapies have changed the diagnosis and 
treatment paradigms for patients with NSCLC.  Research by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium has 
demonstrated that overall survival (OS) is longer for patients who have NSCLC with oncogenic driver mutations 
who were treated with molecularly targeted therapies in their treatment paradigm (Kris et al 2014). The 
discovery of mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cleft within the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain has better defined which patients would derive clinical benefit from the targeted 
treatment of these driver mutations (Lynch et al 2004).  It also has furthered understanding of the development 
of resistance to treatment (Jamal-Hanjani et al 2017). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
EGFR-activating mutations occur in about 10% to 20% of White patients and in about 30% to 50% in East Asian 
patients with NSCLC out of the approximately 1.6 million patients worldwide diagnosed with NSCLC annually 
(Midha et al 2015).  EGFR-activating mutations are more common in tumours of non-squamous than of 
squamous histology, in women than in men, in Asians than in non-Asians, and in never-smokers than in prior or 
current smokers. The presence of EGFR-activating mutations is less well studied in some populations such as 
Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Pacific Islanders (Sholl et al 2015). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The two most frequent sensitising mutations are Ex19del and L858R that account for 85-90% of EGFR 
TKI-sensitising mutations found in NSCLC (Lynch et al 2004; Paez et al 2004). Tumours harbouring these 
mutations are particularly sensitive towards EGFR-TKIs and undergo significant apoptosis in response to 
exposure to these agents (Mitsudomi and Yatabe 2010). Multiple randomised clinical studies have shown that 
the presence of common sensitising EGFR mutations in patients with advanced NSCLC is predictive of response 
and improved treatment outcome to EGFR-TKIs. Patients with less common sensitising EGFR mutations such as 
L861Q or G719X, while still benefitting from EGFR-TKIs, have a lesser magnitude of benefit. 
In approximately 50% to 65% of the patients the resistance is due to the development of a secondsite EGFR-TKI 
resistance-conferring 'gatekeeper' point mutation, T790M leading to treatment failure and disease progression 
(Jackman et al 2009, Maemondo et al 2010, Mitsudomi et al 2010, Mok et al 2009, Oxnard et al 2011, Rosell et 
al 2012, Sebastian et al 2014). 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 10/144 
  
  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Therapeutic  decisions  for  NSCLC  patients  are  dependent  upon  speciﬁc  tumour  histological  subtype. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to increase the speciﬁcity of diagnosis in the small sample setting and 
reduce the NSCLC-NOS (not otherwise speciﬁed) rate to fewer than 10% of cases diagnosed. Two markers only, 
p40 or p63 to predict squamous cell carcinoma and TTF1 to predict adenocarcinoma, are generally all that is 
required.  
An  example  is  the  use  of  third-generation  EGFR  TKIs  against  T790M-mutated  resistant  tumours,  the  most 
common ﬁnding in EGFR-mutated tumours relapsing after ﬁrst-/second generation EGFR TKI therapy (Janne et 
al 2015; Mok et al 2017). Pathologists should take steps to ensure that tissue handling and processing prioritises 
all  testing  required  for  treatment  selection.  Genetic  alterations,  which  are  key  oncogenic  events  (driver 
mutations), have been identiﬁed in NSCLC, with two of these EGFR mutations and the anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) rearrangements—determining approved, selective pathway directed systemic therapy. 
Activating (sensitising) EGFR mutations are predictive for response to the EGFR TKIs. EGFR mutation testing 
should use validated methodology in a laboratory participating in an external quality assurance scheme in all 
such patient subgroups. The methodology used should provide the test sensitivity required for the tumour 
content of the sample and provide an adequate coverage of all clinically relevant mutations. Test methodology 
should have adequate coverage of mutations in exons 18–21, including those associated with speciﬁc drug 
resistance. At a minimum, when resources or material are limited, the most common activating mutations (exon 
19 deletion and exon 21 L858R point mutation, including exon 20 T790M) should be determined (Planchard et 
al 2018). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Early studies using small-molecule inhibitors of EGFR were performed in a generalised, all-comers population 
with mixed results.  Gefitinib and erlotinib were initially studied in previously treated NSCLC.  
Gefitinib  was  studied  first  in  2002  in  2  large  Phase  2  studies  that  showed  improved  tumour  response  at  2 
different doses.  This did not translate into improvements in survival in the Phase 3 trial except in a subgroup of 
Asian patients. Erlotinib was studied in the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group (NCIC-CTG) 
trial BR.21 in treatment-refractory NSCLC and showed an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) over 
placebo. Improved response to treatment and prolonged PFS was later noted with the identification of various 
mutations within EGFR that demonstrated increased sensitivity to this class of EGFR TKIs; this is especially true 
for the EGFR-activating mutations, deletion in exon 19 (del exon 19) and the L858R substitution mutation in 
exon 21 (L858R). An evaluation of gefitinib versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of 
NSCLC  studied  in  unselected  patient  populations  and  compared  the  results  with  patients  whose  tumours 
expressed EGFR mutations was performed in Asia and reported in 2009.  
The patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations had improvements in objective response rate (ORR) and PFS 
when  treated  with  EGFR  TKIs,  while  the  unselected  population  demonstrated  no  difference  between  the 
treatment  arms.  The  PFS  improvement  did  not  translate  into  OS  improvements  due  to  patients  with 
EGFR-activating mutations in the chemotherapy doublet arm crossing over to receive gefitinib.  Similar results 
were noted in other studies where patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations were studied comparing EGFR TKIs 
to platinum-doublet chemotherapy, where improvements were noted in ORR and PFS, but not in OS. 
Second-generation  irreversible  pan-human  EGFR  (HER)TKIs  were  developed  to  improve  PFS  and  OS  by 
preventing  the  homodimerization  and  heterodimerization  of  the  HER  family  members  and  block  cascade

activation  involving  RAS,  RAF,  MEK,  and  MAPK  pathways  to  block  cell  proliferation,  survival,  invasion,  and 
metastases, and also by potentially delaying the development of resistance mutations.  Afatinib was approved 
based upon improved PFS when compared to chemotherapy doublets.  
A  third-generation  EGFR  TKI  (osimertinib)  has  been  developed  targeting  the  primary  EGFR  TKI  resistance 
mutation,  a  secondary  point  mutation  at  amino  acid  position  790  that  substitutes  methionine  for  threonine 
(T790M) in exon 20, occurring in approximately 60% of all patients treated with EGFR TKIs. Osimertinib showed 
a  statistically  significant  response  as  shown  by  improvements  in  ORR  (to  77%  for  osimertinib  and  39%  for 
platinum and pemetrexed); odds ratio 4.96%, 95%CI:2.49, 10.15; p<0.001) and PFS (mPFS of 8.2 months for 
osimertinib and 4.2 months for platinum and pemetrexed (HR=0.42 [95%CI:0.29, 0.61] p-value not noted) in 
patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations and with documented EGFR T790M mutation. Osimertinib 
has been approved for use in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) for patients with EGFR T790M 
mutation-positive NSCLC whose disease progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy.  In the recently reported 
FLAURA study, osimertinib demonstrated improved PFS (target number of events for final OS analysis has not 
yet  been  reached)  with  acceptable  safety  in  patients  with  NSCLC  with  EGFR-activating  mutations  when 
compared to other first-generation EGFR TKIs. 
Despite these therapeutic advances, patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations continue to have 
disease progression within a period of 8 to 11 months after first-line EGFR TKI therapy.  Current options for 
therapy now include first-, second-, or third generation EGFR TKIs in the first-line treatment setting, or after 
receiving platinum-doublet chemotherapy while mutation analysis is being determined. 
About the product 
Dacomitinib is a pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) (EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER4) inhibitor, 
with activity against mutated EGFR with deletions in exon 19 or the L858R substitution in exon 21. Dacomitinib 
binds selectively and irreversibly to its HER family targets thereby providing prolonged inhibition. 
The indication adopted by the CHMP is: 
Vizimpro, as monotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating 
mutations. 
Treatment with Vizimpro should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
medicinal products. 
EGFR mutation status should be established prior to initiation of dacomitinib therapy (see section 4.4). 
The recommended dose of Vizimpro is 45 mg taken orally once daily, until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity occurs.    
Dose modifications may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If dose reduction is necessary, 
then the dose of Vizimpro should be reduced as described in Table 1. Dose modification and management 
guidelines for specific adverse reactions are provided in Table 2 (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

Type of Application and aspects on development 
A summary of the discussions and outcomes of  the  relevant meetings with EU Health regarding  the clinical 
development program and regulatory submission plans for dacomitinib for the proposed indication is provided 
below.  
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/686605/2010; EMA/CHMP/SAWP/768966/2012 
- 
Pfizer received final CHMP scientific advice related to Study 1050 study design and registration strategy 
on 13 December 2012.  The CHMP agreed with the Study 1050 study design, endpoints, and use of 
gefitinib as comparator.  The CHMP also agreed that the results of Study 1050, in addition to the results 
of Study1017, would be adequate to support approval of dacomitinib in the proposed indication.  
- 
The  CHMP  recommended  including  patients  with  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance status 0 to 2 in Study 1050 and possibly stratifying by ECOG performance status 0 to 1 
versus 2. Based on the advice of the key investigators across all regions, the applicant enrolled patients 
with ECOG performance status 0 to 1 in order to avoid possible inclusion of patients with poor/borderline 
performance or short life expectancy.

- 
The CHMP recommended including a sufficient number of EU patients in the pivotal study 1050 to ensure 
that  the  results  observed  in  the  total  population  could  be  safely  extrapolated  to  EU  patients.  The 
applicant maintained their proposed approach, and the final proportion of patients enrolled in the EU 
(23.5%) was lower than originally planned in the SA (30%). 
- 
The CHMP also suggested to re-biopsy patients at the time of disease progression in order to investigate 
mechanisms of resistance; however, tumour specimens upon disease progression were not collected per 
protocol, as it was not considered feasible.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg of dacomitinib as 
dacomitinib monohydrate. 
Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, sodium starch glycolate and Opadry® II 
Blue 85F30716 (composed of polyvinyl alcohol – part hydrolysed (E1203), talc (E553b), titanium dioxide 
(E171), macrogol/PEG 3350 (E1521), FD&C Blue # 2/indigo carmine aluminium lake (E132)). 
The product is available in the EU in aluminium/aluminium blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of dacomitinib monohydrate is 
(2E)-N-{4-[(3-Chloro-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-7-methoxyquinazolin-6-yl}-4-(piperidin-1-yl)but-2-enamide 
monohydrate corresponding to molecular formula C24H25ClFN5O2 · H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 
487.95 Daltons and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of dacomitinib was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, UV/VIS, NMR (1H, 
13C, 15N, 19F, a combination of mono and bi-dimensional experiments) and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, 
single X-ray diffraction. The thermal properties of dacomitinib were determined by Differential Scanning 
Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). 
Dacomitinib is a non-hygroscopic, white to  pale  yellow powder that  is practically insoluble in water, slightly 
soluble  in  acetone  and  acetonitrile  and  sparingly  soluble  in  acetic  acid.  It  is  classified  as  BCS  Class  II  (low 
solubility and high permeability) based on the Biopharmaceutical Classification System.  
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 14/144 
  
  
 
The active substance does not exhibit chirality. The configuration at the olefinic double bond in the structure of 
dacomitinib monohydrate is trans as shown in Figure 1. 
The  active  substance  shows  polymorphism.  Three  relevant  forms  of  dacomitinib  have  been  identified: 
monohydrate Form A, monohydrate Form B and anhydrous Form C.  
Dacomitinib monohydrate Form A is the solid state form selected for development and commercialization. This 
is the thermodynamically favoured and predominant solid state form which was identified from extensive form 
screening experiments and crystallization studies across a diverse range of solvents and temperatures (4 to 
75°C).  
The manufacturing process has been designed to ensure monohydrate Form A is produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by a single manufacturer in a three-step convergent synthesis with one 
isolated intermediate. No alternative processes, reprocessing or recoveries have been proposed. 
To justify the selection of starting materials an extensive discussion on impurities arising from the synthesis of 
starting materials, fate, purge data and typical levels of these impurities are provided in the dossier. Spiking 
experiments  show  that  all  specified  impurities  arising  from  the  synthesis  of  these  starting  materials  are 
effectively removed during the GMP manufacturing process. None of these impurities or their fate products are 
present  in  the  active  substance  above  the  limit  for  unspecified  impurities.  Overall,  the  proposed  starting 
materials have been adequately justified in line with ICH Q11 and acceptable specifications have been set. 
The batch size (i.e. quantities of raw materials) and expected yields have been stated.  
The manufacturing process of the active substance has been satisfactorily described and adequate in-process 
controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  Acceptable  specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The synthetic route has been executed at laboratory, pilot and commercial scale and has been shown to produce 
dacomitinib meeting all specifications. The process knowledge gained through a combination of multivariate and 
univariate  experiments,  as  well  as  scale  and  equipment  dependency  studies  were  used  to  establish  the 
manufacturing conditions. Although not initially proposed by the applicant, a design space covering Steps 1-3 
has been defined and is considered acceptable. Scientific rationale has been presented to identify the process 
parameters  that  are  expected  to  be  independent  on  scale,  therefore  verification  of  the  design  space  is  not 
needed at commercial scale. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis 
data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
A genotoxic risk assessment was performed. It has been demonstrated that these impurities are purged to 
negligible levels during the GMP manufacturing process. Given the results obtained and the fact that dacomitinib 
is intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, specific limits for genotoxic impurities were not established. 
Actual and potential impurities were assessed using two complementary (Q)SAR methodologies, along with 
expert review of additional publicly available databases and internal data to identify potentially mutagenic 
impurities. The results from in vitro mutagenicity testing are provided in the non-clinical section. Briefly, several 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 15/144 
  
  
impurities gave positive result in in vitro mutagenicity test, and were classified as class 2 (known mutagens with 
unknown carcinogenic potential.  
All class 3 and class 2 impurities were further evaluated to assess the risk of being present in dacomitinib by a 
combination of fate and purge experimentation and/or analytical testing of pilot scale batches. This evaluation 
resulted in the identification of 4 genotoxic impurities that have the greatest potential of being present in 
dacomitinib. However, levels observed were extremely low or not detected. The batch and spiking data 
presented showed that the proposed commercial process purges these impurities to negligible levels. 
As part of an overall risk assessment for elemental impurities, dacomitinib active substance manufactured 
according to the commercial process was screened for ICH Q3D Class 1 and Class 2A elements and the 
intentionally added elemental impurity is used as catalyst in the synthesis. The acceptable levels for the 
individual impurities were set based on ICH Q3D Option 1 to ensure the oral PDEs of the individual elemental 
impurities are not exceeded in the finished product. Available data resulting from screening several batches of 
dacomitinib active substance showed levels of the catalyst in all cases. Based on the data collected, the Class 1 
and 2A elemental impurities and the catalyst will not be routinely monitored in dacomitinib active substance. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Two synthetic pathways were employed for the manufacture of dacomitinib active 
substance during development for use in clinical studies. Several synthetic routes were designed for each 
synthetic pathway as knowledge increased. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the changes did not have a significant impact on 
the quality of the product. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  container  which  complies  with  the  requirements  of  relevant  Ph.  Eur. 
monographs or EC regulation No. 10/2011 on plastic and articles for food contact  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR), assay (LC), impurities 
(specified impurities, unspecified and total impurities) (LC), water content (KF), residual solvents (HS-GC), 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction).  
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). The CQA 
included in the active substance specification that are specific to the dacomitinib manufacturing process are: 
water content, particle size distribution, specified impurity, unspecified impurities, and residual solvents. 
Only one impurity is specified in dacomitinib. The proposed acceptance criterion is in accordance with ICH Q3A 
for an identified impurity absent of genotoxic structural concern. 
Dacomitinib active substance is isolated as a monohydrate and is non-hygroscopic. The specified water content 
ensures the correct solid form is isolated. All dacomitinib active substance batches manufactured throughout 
development were isolated as monohydrate Form A, with water contents within the proposed acceptance 
criterion. 
The dacomitinib particle size specification was established in accordance with guidance provided in ICH Q6A with 
due consideration given to the impact on manufacturability, dissolution and pharmacokinetics of the finished 
product as described in the pharmaceutical development section. Polymorphism is not included in the 
specification. As described above, dacomitinib (Form A) is the solid form selected for development and 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 16/144 
  
  
commercialization. Form A is the thermodynamically favoured and predominant solid state form which was 
identified from extensive form screening experiments and crystallization studies across a diverse range of 
solvents and temperatures. 
The omission of a specific control for elemental impurities, certain residual solvents, and microbiology in 
dacomitinib active substance specification has been adequately justified based on scientific rationale and batch 
analysis data.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 31 batches of dacomitinib manufactured at both the development and commercial 
manufacturing sites have been presented. These batches were used for toxicology, development and stability 
studies and for the manufacture of finished product for clinical studies. Data from commercial scale batches 
manufactured by the proposed commercial manufacturing route and site have been included. Some of the batch 
analysis results obtained throughout development of the dacomitinib active substance and presented in the 
dossier were derived from analytical procedures that differ from proposed for the evaluation of commercial 
active substance. This is due to the evolution of analytical methodology during the development process. Each 
procedure was validated at the time of its use. Both the methods and specifications in place at the time of 
release for the respective batches were appropriate for the stage of development. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. The batch data and stability results support the proposed 
specification.  
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of the active substance used in clinical studies and 
manufactured by development synthetic route were provided. Both the development synthetic route and the 
commercial processes are deemed comparable since they include the same bond forming steps and similar 
impurity profiles. The only differences were related to reagents and minor processing conditions, which do not 
impact stability of the final active substance. One commercial scale batch of dacomitinib active substance 
manufactured by this revised process proposed for marketing and stored in the intended commercial package 
was added to the primary stability study. Since there are no significant differences between these synthetic 
routes and the active substance manufactured using these routes show comparable quality, the selection of 
batches for the stability studies is considered acceptable.  
Samples were stored for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. The stability samples were 
evaluated for appearance, assay, impurities, water content, TAMC and TYMC. The batch manufactured as per 
the synthetic process proposed for marketing was also tested for solid form (XRPD) and particle size and 
conformed to the specification. 
The appearance of stability samples stored under long term and accelerated conditions remained unchanged 
throughout the stability program and met the acceptance criteria. There were no significant changes observed 
in assay values under long term and accelerated conditions. Results for all impurities remained essentially 
unchanged for samples stored under both storage conditions. The impurity values met the acceptance criteria. 
All water content values for stability samples met the acceptance criteria under both storage conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 17/144 
  
  
The real time and accelerated studies demonstrated that dacomitinib active substance manufactured by either 
synthetic route show equivalent stability. 
A stability study was conducted under stressed conditions on the batch manufactured by the commercial route 
to further demonstrate the comparable stability profiles of dacomitinib active substance manufactured by the 
different synthetic routes.  Batches of dacomitinib active substance were stored in open glass vials and exposed 
to various temperatures and levels of humidity. There was little detectable degradation observed in all lots 
during the duration of the study, showing that the compound is very stable even when exposed to stress storage 
conditions regardless of the manufacturing process. 
A photostability study was carried out according to the ICH Guideline Q1B on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products on one batch A dark control sample was covered and placed in the light cabinet 
alongside the unpackaged test sample. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities and water. All 
parameters remained unchanged versus the dark control. Therefore, it was concluded that dacomitinib active 
substance is not light sensitive and does not require a light restriction. 
Forced degradation studies were also conducted. Samples of dacomitinib active substance were exposed to acid, 
base, water, hydrogen peroxide, heat, humidity and simulated sunlight. The stress conditions studied were 
chosen to ensure that potential degradation pathways and major degradation products are elucidated and that 
the assay and purity methods are appropriately stability indicating. Most degradation was observed when 
dacomitinib active substance was stressed at high temperature. No degradation was observed under the neutral 
,oxidative or basic conditions Minor degradation was observed for acidic and photostability .In the solid state, no 
degradation was observed at high temperature/high humidity No significant decrease in the assay value was 
observed when no degradation had occurred and acceptable mass balance was achieved for all conditions. The 
assay and purity method for dacomitinib active substance was shown to be specific, selective, and 
stability-indicating. 
In conclusion, the stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The proposed commercial formulation of dacomitinib consists of dacomitinib blue immediate release film-coated 
tablets available in three strengths: 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg. All strengths are prepared from a common blend 
using common pharmaceutical excipients and manufactured by a conventional direct compression process. The 
strengths are dose-proportionate. The range of strengths is suitable to accommodate the dosing regimen 
described in the SmPC, including controlled dose reduction in case of unacceptable side reactions. The tablets 
are differentiated by tablet size and debossing: 
  The proposed commercial 15 mg tablet consists of a tablet size of 6.35 mm with de-bossing of ‘Pfizer’ on 
one side and ‘DCB 15’ on the opposite side. The 15 mg strength is a round, biconvex, blue film-coated 
tablet. 
  The proposed commercial 30 mg tablet consists of a tablet size of 7.5 mm with de-bossing of ‘Pfizer’ on 
one side and ‘DCB 30’ on the opposite side. The 30 mg strength is a round, biconvex, blue film-coated 
tablet. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 18/144 
  
  
  The proposed commercial 45 mg tablet consists of a tablet size of 9.0 mm with de-bossing of ‘Pfizer’ on 
one side and ‘DCB 45’ on the opposite side. The 45 mg strength is a round, biconvex, blue film-coated 
tablet. 
The development of Vizimpro followed an enhanced approach in accordance with ICH Q8. Attributes and 
parameters were categorized as either critical or non-critical based on their impact to product quality. A Quality 
Target Product Profile (QTPP) has been established as immediate release dosage form containing dacomitinib, 
that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards for appearance, identity, assay, impurities, 
uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and microbial limits.  
Once the proposed commercial formulation and manufacturing process for Vizimpro were established, an 
understanding of the relationships between materials and process parameters and the quality attributes 
identified in the QTPP was developed. Components of the finished product, process operating parameters, and 
packaging components were assessed with respect to their potential to impact the quality attributes. The initial 
correlation to CQAs was determined based upon prior knowledge of immediate release formulation and 
development and scale-up of the manufacturing process. 
After identifying materials and process operating parameters with potential links to CQAs, an experimental plan 
was developed and executed to analyse the functional relationships. The results were evaluated to (a) establish 
if the identified materials and parameters significantly impacted a quality attribute, (b) identify the ranges within 
which the process could be operated to produce dacomitinib finished product that met the defined limits and (c) 
determine an appropriate overall control strategy. The criticality of each operating parameter was designated, 
and acceptable operating ranges were established in order to assure the process and resulting finished product 
were appropriately controlled. 
The manufacturing process is supported by a control strategy that assures each quality attribute is within the 
appropriate range required to deliver the desired efficacy, safety and quality of the finished product.  
As indicated in the active substance section, dacomitinib Form A free-base monohydrate is the form that has 
been consistently isolated during the active substance manufacturing process and was selected for development 
and commercialization. Dacomitinib is a non-hygroscopic, white to pale yellow powder that is classified as BCS 
Class II (low solubility and high permeability) based on the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. 
Dacomitinib solubility is pH dependent, with solubility being highest under low pH gastric conditions in the fasted 
state. The impact of active substance particle size was an important consideration during finished product 
development, as dissolution of dacomitinib finished product may limit absorption. Therefore, particle size 
distribution was considered to be a CQA of the active substance. 
A range of active substance particle distributions were used to support clinical studies. Based on the results 
obtained in clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies, dissolution testing, content uniformity and dissolution 
modelling, a particle size limit was included in the active substance specification.  
The proposed direct compression tablet formulation was based on a dry granulated formulation used for early 
clinical studies. The microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, sodium starch glycolate and magnesium 
stearate used in the dry granulated formulation were maintained for the directly compressed tablet, and a 
non-functional aqueous film coat was applied.  
The  Functional  Related  Characteristics  (FRC)  of  the  excipients  used  in  dacomitinib  immediate  release  blue 
film-coated tablets was also reviewed. The finished product was found to have one principle degradant. Work 
was conducted to evaluate whether the  use  of different excipients had  a positive effect on finished product 
stability.  Active  substance  compatibility  testing  under  accelerated  conditions  was  carried  out  with  blends 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 19/144 
  
  
containing different excipients and levels of excipients to determine the impact on the formation of the main 
finished product degradant. Overall, substituting any of the selected excipients had no positive effect on the 
level of degradant, so the qualitative formulation used for the dry granulated tablet was maintained throughout 
development of the directly compressed tablet formulation. 
The final formulation includes microcrystalline cellulose and lactose monoyhydrate (as diluents), sodium starch 
glycolate (as disintegrant), magnesium stearate (as lubricant) and Opadry® II Blue 85F30716 (as film-coating 
agent). All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Different formulations, strengths and pharmaceutical forms of dacomitinib were used to support the different 
phases of clinical development.  
Dissolution rate studies were conducted throughout development to assess the impact of the changes made on 
dissolution performance.  Dissolution rates were found comparable using the proposed commercial dissolution 
method. None of the changes studied had a significant impact on dissolution. Similarity between the clinical 
formulation and the commercial formulation was determined using a relative bioavailability study and by 
dissolution rate testing. Clinical study (A7471022) was performed to determine the relative bioavailability of the 
white film-coated 45 mg dacomitinib tablet to 3 uncoated 15 mg tablets as a single dose following oral 
administration in the fasted state to healthy volunteers. Based on the results of this clinical study, acceptable 
equivalence between the formulations has been demonstrated.  
In vitro dissolution of the dacomitinib dosage forms was evaluated across the physiological pH range to assess 
the impact on dissolution of the pH dependent solubility of the active substance. Drug release was fast at low pH, 
in line with the high solubility of dacomitinib, and slow at high pH, in line with the low solubility of dacomitinib. 
A number of development formulations varying the amounts of lubricant, disintegrant and tablet hardness were 
assessed using the dissolution test conditions. Overall the data presented demonstrate the suitability of the 
dissolution method for the quality control of the product. 
As indicated above, dacomitinib immediate release blue film-coated 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg tablets are 
manufactured using a conventional direct compression and aqueous film coat manufacturing process using 
equipment commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. Manufacturing process development 
demonstrated that the desired attributes of the QTPP will be met, and that the manufacturing process is robust.  
Multivariate and univariate experimental studies were conducted to generate process knowledge and establish 
acceptable ranges for blending, lubrication and compression.  
Clinical and registration stability batches have been manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing 
site using the proposed commercial manufacturing equipment. 
The container closure system selected for the commercial tablets of dacomitinib 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg 
consists of aluminum foil blisters with aluminum foil backing as stated in the SmPC. 
All product contact plastic components of the packaging system comply with the requirements of EU Regulation 
No. 10/2011. All packaging components also comply, where applicable, with the current European 
Pharmacopeia. 
Development stability studies showed that protective packaging is beneficial to control the formation of the shelf 
life limiting degradation product when exposed to high relative humidity. Overall, the choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: blending, compression, film-coating and packaging.  
The manufacturing process is supported by a control strategy that assures each quality attribute is within the 
appropriate range required to deliver the desired efficacy, safety and quality of the finished product. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  There are no critical in-process tests for 
manufacture of dacomitinib tablets. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number 
of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The formal validation on production scale batches will be 
completed prior to release of the product for commercial use according to the proposed process validation 
scheme. This is acceptable since the manufacturing process is a standard direct compression and the proportion 
of the active substance in the tablet is above 2%. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and include: 
appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution, content uniformity 
(HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC, E. coli) (Ph. Eur.).The proposed specification 
for the product is in general acceptable for an immediate release dosage form. Limit proposed for degradation 
impurity at release is in accordance with ICH Q3B for a maximum daily dose of dacomitinib of 45 mg and has 
been qualified in safety studies.  
In line with ICH Q3D, an elemental impurities risk assessment was performed on the dacomitinib finished 
product. The active substance, excipients, manufacturing equipment and utilities, and packaging components 
were evaluated as part of the risk assessment. Screening results on the active substance demonstrated that it 
is not a source of any Class 1 or Class 2A elemental impurities, and not a significant source of catalyst. To 
confirm the findings of the risk assessment, several batches of dacomitinib finished product, manufactured 
according to the commercial process at the commercial site and scale, were screened for elemental impurities 
identified during the risk assessment. Based on the data collected, no controls or acceptance criteria for 
individual elemental impurities are proposed for dacomitinib finished product, as the risk of elemental impurities 
being present at levels above their PDEs has been established to be negligible via the risk assessment, combined 
with supporting analytical data. 
In accordance with ICH Q6A, Specifications, Decision Tree 8 (Microbiological Attributes of Non-Sterile Drug 
Products), the applicant proposed to eliminate routine microbiological testing. The justification was based on the 
following considerations; excipient controls, environmental controls and batch and stability data, and is 
considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for a total of 44 batches produced during the development, including 19 
batches manufactured for clinical use and stability. All the batches comply with specification, confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  commercial  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  60  months  under  long  term 
conditions (30 °C / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. All batches were manufactured and packaged at the proposed commercial 
site greater than 10% of commercial scale. A bracketing approach was used . 
Potential  stability-related  quality  attributes  that  were  evaluated  for  the  finished  product  within  the  primary 
(registration)  stability  program  include  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  and 
microbiological quality. 
Two attributes were observed to trend on stability, the main degradation product and water content, but all 
results complied with the proposed specification. In line with these findings, protective packaging was selected 
for dacomitinib finished product to reduce the impact of moisture on stability. No stability trends were observed 
for appearance, assay, unspecified degradation products, dissolution or microbial limits and all data remained 
within the proposed limits. 
Supportive stability data were obtained on tablets packaged in HDPE bottles containing desiccant with 
polypropylene closure stored for up to 60 months at 30 °C / 75% RH and 6 months at 40 °C / 75% RH. All 
results were within the specification. 
In addition, a photostability of one batch of each strength was evaluated in accordance with ICH guideline Q1B. 
No significant changes were observed in any of the parameters measured, namely appearance, assay, 
degradation products, water content and dissolution. Therefore, it is concluded that dacomitinib tablets are 
stable to light and no precautionary packaging or labelling is required. 
Forced degradation experiments were performed on 15 mg and 45 mg immediate release blue film-coated 
dacomitinib tablets from the primary registration batches and placebo mixtures to establish the extent and 
nature of potential degradation pathways and to confirm the suitability of the LC assay and purity method. The 
stress conditions included thermal, thermal/humidity and photolysis studies. No additional oxidation studies 
over those performed on the active substance were performed on the finished product, as no related 
degradation was observed during active substance purposeful degradation testing. Samples were analysed for 
potency and degradation products.  
The studies conducted on dacomitinib tablets exposed to stress conditions showed that significant degradation 
was induced under thermal/humidity stress conditions and that only one significant degradation product was 
formed. A light degradation product was observed under strong light conditions only. No additional degradation 
products were observed, and mass balance was achieved. Under humidity stress conditions low levels of 
degradation products were formed. Under thermal stress conditions higher degradation was observed. These 
studies confirm that the assay and purity method is selective and stability indicating. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 60 months for the finished product in the proposed 
container (aluminium/aluminium blisters) with no special storage conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3), is acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a largely satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the 
development of the active substance and/or finished product and their manufacturing process. A design space 
covering all steps of the synthesis was defined.  
2.2.1.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give reassurance 
on TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology profile and mechanism of action of dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is presented through in vitro 
biochemical and cellular assays, as well as in vivo xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic profile of dacomitinib was 
investigated in rats and dogs, in which oral and intravenous routes of administration were evaluated. 
Metabolism characterisation was reported in in vitro studies. In the case of the non-clinical safety evaluation of 
dacomitinib, a conventional toxicological package, in line with ICH guideline S9. Pivotal studies were conducted 
in compliance with GLP regulations.  Environmental Risk Assessment was conducted in line with  
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamic studies were conducted to show potency, selectivity and pharmacological actions of 
dacomitinib. The pharmacological characterisation was based on both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. 
In vitro 
In vitro inhibition of HER kinase targets and kinase non-targets 
Inhibition of HER family receptor tyrosine kinase activity: dacomitinib was initially tested towards its original 
target, i.e. HER kinase family. Its activity as tyrosine kinase inhibitor was measured in biochemical kinase 
assays based on competitive binding at the ATP binding site (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001). Accordingly, 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019

inhibition of human catalytic domain of HER-1, HER-2 and HER-4 were evaluated. HER-3 was not tested due to 
it does not possess intrinsic kinase activity. The values of IC50 were 2.8 ng/mL (6.0 nM), 21.5 ng/mL (45.7 nM) 
and 34.7 ng/mL (73.7 nM), respectively for HER-1, HER-2 and HER-4. 
Irreversible inhibition of EGFR kinase activity: to test the potential irreversible inhibition, purified EGFR was 
pre-incubated with 825 nM of dacomitinib (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001). Next, assay solution was diluted 
(167-fold), up to approximately 5 nM, which is below the IC50 value described in the previous paragraph (6.0 
nM). Less than 10% of HER-1 enzyme activity was recovered after dilution.  
Inactivation kinetic parameters on EGFR variants: the kinetic analysis was determined using a numerical 
integration approach of the differential equations describing the component processes (study 
PF-0299804_063846). Initial characterization of EGFR showed a Ki of 0.16 ± 0.01 nM, kinact of 1.5 ± 0.1 ms-1, 
and a kinact/Ki of 9,900,000 ± 800,000 M-1s-1. Dacomitinib was less potent toward EGFR-L858R/T790M, resulting 
in Ki = 0.63 ± 0.04 nM, kinact of 1.8 ± 0.1 ms-1, kinact/Ki = 2,800,000 ± 300,000 M-1s-1. The applicant mentioned 
that the previous assay method was not a rapid screening assay, so it decided to conduct a higher capacity 
kinetic method to screen different forms of EGFR. By using this new method, dacomitinib was defined as a potent 
inhibitor of the EGFR forms but del19 variant. The affinity for this variant was also potent (Ki est = 0.4 – 3.8 nM) 
and the inactivation specificity high (kinact / Ki est 71,500 –7,410,000 M-1s-1). The values obtained toward EGFR 
variants are shown in the following table (Table 3).

Similarly to the previously described kinetic screening method, the main metabolite PF-05199265 was also 
analysed. The affinity was estimated as potent (Ki est = 0.14-4.4 nM) and the inactivation specificity high (kinact / 
Ki est = 323000-368000 M-1s-1). 
2 
Kinase selectivity in biochemical enzyme assays: dacomitinib was tested in two kinase panels, isolated at Pfizer 
and Invitrogen (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001). In the set of assays conducted with Pfizer isolated enzymes, 
dacomitinib showed the highest selectivity for EGFR compared with other kinases (>100-fold). A relevant 
inhibitory effect was also observed in LCK and SCR kinases. The IC50 values for these two enzymes were 94 and 
110 nM, respectively, which were within 20-fold of dacomitinib concentration for the EFGR inhibition. In the 
Invitrogen kinase panel, dacomitinib showed to be at least 100-fold more selective for EGFR than the 90% of the 
kinases included in this panel. Values of IC50 were estimated with kinases in which dacomitinib at 1 M showed 
>50% inhibitory activity. The lowest values (maximum inhibition) were obtained with EGFR (0.5 nM), HER4 (7 
nM), HER2 (19 nM), BLK (81 nM), FGR (82 nM), LCK (83 nM), YES (112 nM) and SRC (130 nM) kinases.

In addition to the previous kinases panel, the selectivity of dacomitinib and its main metabolite (PF-05199265) 
was also assessed in a 274 kinase assay panel (study PF-00299804_063846). Only 5 (DDR1, EPHA6, LCK, 
DDR2, MNK1) out of 274 kinases without a cysteine residue in the hinge region of the ATP binding, were 
inhibited more than 50 % with dacomitinib. Accordingly, the Ki values were estimated to be 2 nM, 18 nM, 29 nM, 
30 nM and 45 nM, respectively to DDR1, EPHA6, LCK, DDR2, MNK1. Only DDR1 was expected to have potency 
within 100-fold of wild-type EGFR. No kinases of this group were inhibited by PF-05199265. 
The effect of dacomitinib and PF-05199265 on a 10-kinase group (ErbB-2 (HER2), ErbB-4 (HER4), BTK, BLK, 
BMX, JAK3, ITK, TEC, TXK, MAP2K7) with a similar cysteine residue (EGFR-Cys797) was evaluated. In this assay, 
both dacomitinib and PF-05199265 showed a significant potency toward HER2 and HER4 (>50% inhibition) but 
not to the other related kinases.  
Inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation in intact cells: a cell-based assay was used to 
test the potential inhibition by dacomitinib of EGFR and HER2 (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001). 
Phosphorylation levels were measured by immunoblotting from cells transfected with human HER-1 or a 
chimeric receptor (extracellular domain of EGFR and intracellular domain of HER2). Dacomitinib in NIH-3T3 cells 
resulted in IC50 values of 3.5 nM (1.6 ng/ml) and 41 nM (19 ng/mL) for autophosphorylation of HER-1 and 
chimeric receptor HER2, respectively. In A431 human squamous cell carcinoma line, the IC50 value was 21 nM 
(9.9 ng/mL). 
Irreversible activity on EGFR in intact cells: dacomitinib inhibited EGFR activity in A431 cells after preliminary 
incubation followed by drug removal and extensive washing. The effect was observed from 1 minute to two 
hours (study PF-0299804-Pharm-001). The applicant compared this action with erlotinib, which was published 
to be rapidly reversed after washing out the inhibitor (Moyer et al., 1997). 
In vitro inhibition of HER kinase target-dependent cell growth and viability  
Various human cancer cell lines and some of their mutant variants were used to assess the inhibition of growth 
and viability after irreversible HER inhibition (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001). Data are compared with those

obtained with gefitinib. The applicant concluded that dacomitinib showed a better potency, with lower IC50, than 
gefitinib. The results are shown below (Table 03). In this study, KRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines were shown to 
be resistant to gefinitib and dacomitinib.

Dacomitinib was also assessed in an extended panel of cancer cells (lung, breast, colorectal and gastric). In this 
study (study PF-00299804_134805), it is mentioned that most of the lowest IC50 values (maximum inhibition of 
cell growth and viability) corresponded with cell lines carried gene aberrations (mutations, amplifications or 
deletions) in HER family members. 
The applicant cited an independent publication (Engelman et al., 2007), in which IC50 values reported were in 
the same range that the previously shown in Pfizer studies.  
In vivo 
In vivo inhibition of HER kinase targets and effects on tumour growth  
In addition to the studies conducted by the applicant (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001) and described above, 
two publications are also cited with the aim of supporting the action of dacomitinib in human tumour xenograft 
studies (Engelman et al., 2007; Gonzales et al., 2008). 
Inhibition of HER2 autophosphorylation: SKOV3 human ovarian xenograft model was used in this study, in which 
the overexpression of HER2 is known (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001). Athymic mice previously implanted into 
the flank with tumour fragments, received dacomitinib (oral gavage at 30 mg/Kg for two days) when the tumour 
reached a size of 250-400 mm3. After the second dose, tumours were isolated and blood samples taken. The 
relationship between plasma levels and HER phosphorylation (Tyr 1248) was established. HER2 activity was 
suppressed greater than 85% at 48 hours after dosing and the steady-state average plasma concentration was 
estimated (CSS, avg) at 604 ng/mL (20.6 ng/mL unbound concentration). Maximal plasma concentration was 
established at 3 hours. From these data, the total mouse plasma concentration for 50% of inhibition of 
phospho-HER2 was estimated by modelling as 88.8 ng/mL (3.0 ng/mL unbound).

Figure 2: Relationship of PF-00299804 plasma concentration to the degree of HER-2 inhibition in SK-OV-3 
ovarian carcinoma xenografts following oral administration of PF-00299804 (2 days) 
Inhibition of tumour growth: four human xenograft models (H125, SKOV3, A431 or BT-474 tumours implanted) 
expressing/overexpressing genetic dysregulation of HER family members were tested with dacomitinib (study 
PF-00299804-Pharm-001). Two doses were evaluated (30 and 15 mg/kg/day) in SCID mice, with no mortality 
reported. Between 10% and 19% mean body weight loss from initial body weight at study start was observed. 
Daily administration of dacomitinib at these two doses resulted in average steady state plasma concentrations 
of 163 to 604 ng/mL (5.6–20.6 ng/mL, unbound concentration) for 15 and 30 mg/Kg, respectively. The efficacy 
parameters of the study were established as: completed response (at least 75% of volume reduction compared 
to the tumour mass at initial treatment); partial response (at least 50% compared to the tumour mass at initial 
treatment); and tumour growth delay (the difference in days, for the median treated and control tumours to 
reach a fixed evaluation size of 750 or 1000mm3). The results for efficacy parameters are shown below.

The results of oral administration of dacomitinib at 30 mg/kg/day for 14 days to animals bearing advanced-stage 
human ovarian cancer xenograft SKOV-3 are shown in Figure 2 (left panel). It resulted in 6/6 complete tumour 
regressions and a tumour growth delay of 41.2 days. Phospho-HER2 (Tyr 1248) levels were measured (Figure 
02, right panel) by western blotting.

The applicant cited the results obtained by Engelman (Engelman et al., 2007), in which dacomitinib (10 mg/Kg 
daily oral administration) inhibited the tumour growth in a xenograft EGFR-mutant NSCLC model of HCC827 
cells harbouring del19 mutant. 
Projected efficacious plasma concentration for inhibition of xenograft growth: based on the previous study 
conducted in SCID mice implanted with SKOV3 cancer cells (Table 04 and Figure 02), the applicant estimated 
the efficacious concentration for tumour growth inhibition. The following equation was used: 
Tumour growth rate was determined by a 1st-order growth rate constant Kg, the tumour mass M, and a negative 
inhibitory function of tumour mass. TG50 is the tumour mass associated with 50% inhibition of Kg. Tumour 
degradation rate is determined by a 2nd-order rate constant Kd, plasma drug concentration Cp and the tumour 
mass M. The predicted dacomitinib concentration (Ccs= Kg/Kd) that inhibited SKOV3 xenografts to no net 
growth was 250 ng/mL (8.5 ng/mL, fu). 
In vitro and in vivo studies in models harbouring EGFR T790M 
In vitro and in vivo effects of dacomitinib against the EGFR L858R/T790M mutation 
As it was shown in Table 01, dacomitinib inhibited most of the EGFR forms (L858R and del19) in vitro. The 
activity of dacomitinib was compared with lapatinib and gefitinib in NCI-H1975 cells, harbouring primary and 
secondary HER-1 mutations (Figure 4). In this model, the IC50 value for dacomitinib was estimated at 342 nM 
(160 ng/mL), and it was resistant to gefinitib and lapatinib (study PF-00299804-Pharm-001).

The action of dacomitinib (7.5 and 15 mg/Kg) on a xenograft model performed with the same cell line, i.e. 
NCI-H1975, was shown in comparison with erlotinib. No effect was observed in animals treated with erlotinib, 
while dacomitinib resulted in an inhibition of tumour growth of 41% and 77% (Figure 5, left panel). Inhibition of 
phospho-EGFR was also observed in the case of dacomitinib at both dose levels. At 7.5 mg/kg the inhibition was 
69% and 78% and at 15 mg/kg it was 91% and 97% at 2 and 26 hours after dosing, respectively (Figure 5, right 
panel).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The results of binding, cellular and nuclear receptor functional and enzyme and uptake assays were submitted 
with the aim of evaluating the potential off target pharmacological activity of dacomitinib and its main 
metabolite PF-05199265 (studies 100014035 and 100013996). Activity was defined by a response greater than 
50% of a maximal response. Based on this, dacomitinib and PF-05199265 (initial concentration of 10 M) 
showed activity in some of the tested targets.

Central Nervous System 
Neurofunctional actions of dacomitinib were assessed in rats, dosed at 5, 50 or 500 mg/Kg (single dose oral 
gavage). Evaluation of the animals relied on a series of test and experimental measures, such as FOB, body 
temperature and locomotor activity (study 04-2790-06). The results showed no neurofunctional effects in single 
oral doses ≥ 500 mg/Kg (unbound Cmax 62.2 ng/mL at 4 hours post-dose). 
In the general toxicity studies (study 04-2730-03), no effects related to central nervous system were reported 
(clinical signs, brain weights and macroscopic/microscopic examination of brain and spinal cord).  
Cardiovascular System 
Established in vitro and in vivo models were used to report the effects of dacomitinib on the cardiovascular 
function. In the hERG assay (study 04-2730-08), dacomitinib inhibited the current amplitude. The estimation of 
IC50 on hERG potassium channel was 1.58 M (743 ng/mL). The value for IC50 of the main metabolite 
(PF-05199265) of dacomitinib (study 131218.QHJ) was estimated at 23.8 M (10.9 g/mL). 
The potential cardiotoxicity of dacomitinib was also tested in the Purkinje fibres assay (study 
PF299804/IC/001/05). No statistically significant effect was observed in any of the parameters measured 
(resting membrane potential (baseline), action potential amplitude, maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax), and 
action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization). 
In addition to the in vitro assays, in vivo studies were also conducted. Accordingly, instrumented conscious 
Beagle dogs were dosed (oral gavage) with dacomitinib at 10 or 30 mg/Kg (study 04-2730-04). At 10 mg/Kg, 
emesis and loose stools were observed in PK animals. At the highest dose level ocular findings (reddened 
conjunctiva, closed eyes and corneal changes) were also reported. A statistically significant increase in mean 
systolic arterial blood pressure was observed at 30 mg/Kg, although it was attributed to a secondary effect due 
to emesis suffered from 3 animals. The systemic exposure measured at the highest dose level, i.e. 30 mg/Kg, 
was 45.1 ng/mL (unbound Cmax) which corresponds to 26x the levels found (1.72 ng/mL) at the human 
recommended dose (45 mg/Kg QD). 
A 7-day repeat dose toxicity study (study 04-2730-03, non GLP-compliant) was performed including also 
cardiovascular endpoints. The results indicated no treatment-related effects on heart rate, ECG or blood 
pressure. Cardiovascular assessment was also incorporated to the pivotal toxicity studies, 6-month and 
9-month repeat-dose in rats and dogs, respectively. No cardiovascular effects were observed in terms of heart 
weights and further examinations of heart tissue. 
Respiratory system 
Two of the general toxicity studies incorporated respiratory system-related endpoints.  
A pulmonary study in rat (study 04-2730-07) was conducted by the applicant. Pulmonary function (respiratory 
rate and tidal volume) was measured in animals dosed at 5, 50 or 500 mg/Kg (single dose, oral gavage) of 
dacomitinib. A slight increase in tidal volume was observed in the case of animals treated at 5 mg/Kg in the last 
stage of the measurement (97-120 minute postdose). No dose-response was observed, and consequently it was 
considered as not adverse. In the same study, one out of six animals dosed at the highest dose level (500 
mg/Kg) showed decreased activity only immediately after dosing. No additional finding was reported.  
In a non-pivotal 7-day repeat-dose toxicity study conducted in dogs, no effects were reported on respiratory 
rate up to a dose level of 30 mg/Kg/day. During the conductance of the non-clinical pivotal studies (6- and 
9-months for rats and dogs respectively), no effects were observed in terms of microscopic and macroscopic 
examination of lung, trachea and bronchi.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Validated  methods  were  used  for  quantification  of  dacomitinib  in  plasma  of  animals  included  in  the  pivotal 
non-clinical studies. Metabolites were not analysed in these studies. Characterised non-GLP assays were used 
for plasma analysis of dacomitinib and PF-05199265 in dedicated PK studies in rat, rabbit and dog. 
Pharmacokinetic  profile  of  dacomitinib  was  characterised  after  single  and  repeat  dose  administration  of 
dacomitinib in rats, dogs and monkeys.

Permeability and efflux transporters 
Dacomitinib was shown to be a weak to moderate substrate for MDR1 and BCRP, with concentration dependent 
saturation of efflux. It was also reported to be an inhibitor of MDR1 and BCRP. In CaCo-2 assay it exhibited 
moderate bidirectional permeability.  
Distribution 
A  wide  distribution  of  dacomitinib,  and  possibly  of  metabolites,  was  demonstrated  in  rat.  It  was  shown  an 
extensive distribution in 33 tissues. Of interest with respect to the proposed indication, distribution to lungs was 
high in rats (23x blood concentration). Furthermore, data also demonstrated distribution of dacomitinib to brain, 
resulting  in  brain  exposure  levels  similar  to  plasma  exposure  levels  in  mouse.  This  aspect  indicated  that 
dacomitinib may cross the blood brain barrier and reach therapeutic relevant concentrations in brain. In view of 
that brain metastases frequently occur in NSCLC patients, this finding is of clinical interest (see questions raised 
in pharmacological section). The high distribution to the uvea correlates with the identification of eye tissues as 
target for toxicity in both rat and dog. Both dacomitinib and its metabolite PF-05199265 were reported to be 
highly  bound  to  plasma  protein  in  the  in  vitro  studies  (>  95%),  which  was  also  consistent  with  clinical 
determinations.  In  human  plasma,  dacomitinib  can  bind  to  both  human  serum  albumin  (HAS)  and  α1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG). No differences were observed into blood cells and plasma distribution. Dacomitinib was not 
identified as a potential substrate for hepatic transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. No placental transfer assay 
was conducted with dacomitinib. 
Metabolism 
The  primary  metabolic  pathways  for  [14C]dacomitinib  after  incubation  with  human  liver  microsomes  were 
N-oxidation of the piperidine ring to form dacomitinib N-oxide (M8) and deamination of the piperidine ring with 
subsequent cyclization to form a hydroxy metabolite (M6). These were also observed in rat, dog, and monkey 
liver microsomes. In addition, in dog and monkey liver microsomes, defluorination  and subsequent aromatic 
hydroxylation to form a hydroxylated metabolite (M3) was also observed. In cryopreserved human hepatocytes, 
the  primary  metabolic  pathways  were  similar  to  those  observed  after  incubation  with  liver  microsomes. 
Additional metabolites observed included M9 (hydroxylation followed by dehydrogenation at the piperidine ring 
to  form  an  oxo-metabolite),  M2  (glutathione  conjugation  followed  by  subsequent  cleavage  to  cysteine 
conjugate), and M3. The primary metabolic pathways and metabolites in human hepatocytes were also present 
in hepatocytes from rat. 
The major metabolic pathways of [14C]dacomitinib in humans, rats and dogs involved oxidation and glutathione 
conjugation. From the oxidation pathway, M18/PF-05199265 (O-desmethylation) was identified as the major 
metabolite. This metabolite was found in humans (>10%) and also identified in rats and dogs. The  applicant 
characterized  the  metabolite  toxicity  by  comparing  exposure  levels  in  nonclinical  species  to  those  found  in 
humans. However, the factor selected for the conversion between dacomitinib and PF-05199265 was obtained 
from  a  non-GLP  3-day  repeat-dose  study.  In  vitro  metabolism  was  evaluated  in  liver  microsomes  and 
hepatocytes. In this regard, isoform CYP2D6  was  identified to be responsible  for the  formation of  the  main 
metabolite described in human species. Dacomitinib was also identified to be a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6.  
Excretion 
The  excretion  of  dacomitinib  has  been  evaluated  in  rats  (study  DM2006-0299804-039),  dogs  (study 
DM2006-0299804-038 Amendment)  and humans (study PF-00299804_13Sep10_183530). Faecal  route  was 
defined as the major route of excretion, with minimal urinary excretion. Excretion in milk was not evaluated.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Potential actions of dacomitinib on CYP and UGT enzymes and drug transporters were shown by the applicant. 
Dacomitinib did not show time-dependent inactivation against CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 in human liver microsomes and it is unlikely that at clinical doses dacomitinib inhibits 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A. However, dacomitinib showed to be inhibitor of 
CYP2D6. The main metabolite PF-05199265 had no in vitro effect on CYPs, except CYP2D6. Dacomitinib 
reflected a low likelihood of interaction with other drugs involving UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or 
UGT2B15. Although it may have the potential for DDI by inhibiting UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Induction of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 was considered to be low at concentrations clinically relevant. Regarding the 
potential of dacomitinib for inhibit intestinal, hepatic and renal transporters, it showed a low potential to cause 
DDI by inhibiting P-gp (systemically), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and BSEP at clinically relevant 
concentrations. However, dacomitinib may have the potential to inhibit BCRP (systemically according to the 
Draft FDA Guidance only and at the GI tract), P-gp (GI tract), and OCT1. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxic level of dacomitinib was established by the applicant at 50 and 30 mg/Kg for rats (study 
04-2730-02, non-GLP) and dogs (study 04-2730-01, non-GLP), respectively. Animals given with higher dose 
levels showed adverse findings, such as emesis, skin lesions, loose/liquid stools, dehydration, corneal damage 
and decreases in body weight and food consumption.

In the bacterial reverse mutation assay, performed in the presence and absence of metabolic activation, and 
taking into consideration cytotoxicity and insoluble limitations. No mutagenicity was observed. 
DNA damage was evaluated in human peripheral lymphocytes extracted from healthy donors and cultured. The 
results indicated that dacomitinib was weakly clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome 
aberration assay. 
The in vivo potential chromosomal damage of dacomitinib was evaluated in the micronucleus assay in rats. 
Dacomitinib did not induce chromosome damage as evidenced by the absence of micronucleus formation in the 
bone marrow cells of male or female rats when tested up to a maximum tolerated dose of 2000 mg/kg/day. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with dacomitinib.

Reproduction Toxicity 
No fertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted with dacomitinib. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies with dacomitinib, effects on reproductive organs were observed in female rats 
given approximately 0.3 times the unbound AUC at the recommended human dose (for 6 months) and were 
limited to reversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and vagina. There was no effect on reproductive organs in 
male rats given ≤ 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months (approximately 1.1 times the unbound AUC at the recommended 
human dose), or in dogs given ≤ 1 mg/kg/day for 9 months (approximately 0.3 times the unbound AUC at the 
recommended human dose) (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Pregnant female rats were dosed with dacomitinib from gestation day 6 to 17 (study 08GR326). Selected doses 
were 0.2, 1 and 5 mg/Kg/day. A toxicokinetic group with similar dosing regimen was also included in the study 
(results are shown in Table 10). Maternal toxicity (clinical findings, reduced body weight, body weight gain and 
food consumption) was confirmed at 5 mg/Kg/day. The applicant reported no significant foetal external, visceral 
or skeletal malformations at 0.2 and 1 mg/Kg/day dose levels. It established the maternal and developmental 
NOAEL at 1 mg/Kg/day (unbound AUC24 and Cmax of 9.55 ng.h/mL and 0.66 ng/mL, respectively on gestation 
day 17). 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses up to 
approximately 2.4 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the unbound AUC at the recommended human dose during 
the period of organogenesis. Maternal body weight gain and food intake were lower in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
The maternally toxic dose was foetotoxic in rats, resulting in reduced foetal body weights and higher incidence 
of unossified metatarsals (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Maternal toxicity was demonstrated at 4.0 mg/kg/day by a reduction in body weight gain and food consumption. 
There were no treatment-related effects on caesarean section observations or foetal body weights, external, 
visceral, or skeletal malformations or variations. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 1.5 mg/kg (Cmax and 
AUC[0-24] of 11.8 ng/mL and 139 ng.h/mL, respectively). Based on the absence of treatment-related effects on 
embryo-foetal viability, growth, or morphological development, the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 4.0 
mg/kg (Cmax and AUC[0-24] of 26.6 ng/mL and 352 ng·h/mL, respectively). 
No pre- and postnatal development studies were conducted with dacomitinib. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data were obtained from repeated dose and pivotal toxicity studies performed in rats and dogs, 
reprotoxicity studies in rats and rabbits; and in a rat micronucleus assay. Phototoxicity study also incorporated 
a toxicokinetic evaluation. 
When compared plasma concentration at the last day of the study in rats, i.e. day 30 or 180, with the values 
obtained at day 1 postdose, it was observed accumulation in plasma after repeat dose administration. However, 
this effect was not observed when comparison is done between days 90 and 180 in the chronic repeat dose. 
Only  one  toxicokinetic  study  in  rabbits  is  shown  (study  08GR498),  which  corresponded  to  reprotoxicity 
assessment of dacomitinib. In this study, a dose proportional increase of systemic exposure, at gestation day 
19, was observed.  
Three toxicokinetic studies performed in Beagle dogs were reported by theapplicant, related to the absorption 
process of dacomitinib. It was formulated with 0.5% methylcellulose. It is noted that a slight accumulation was 
observed after comparison of Cmax and AUC values of day 1 to day 30 in the 1-month toxicity study (study 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 39/144 
  
  
04-2730-05); and day 1 vs. day 90 or day 272 (study 6348-475) in the 9-month toxicity study. As described in 
the chronic toxicity conducted in rats, no accumulation was observed between days 90 and 272 in dogs. 
Local Tolerance  
Intravenous and perivenous routes of administration were analysed (study 12LJ047) in rabbits. Dacomitinib 
(0.2 or 1 mg/mL) was well-tolerated by both routes. Redness and discoloration was observed 4 days after 
dosing, although no difference was reported with saline, vehicle or treated groups. 
Other toxicity studies 
The applicant reported twenty-four impurities identified from the drug substance. They were evaluated for 
potential mutagenicity in vitro. One degradation product occurred after storage of the drug product was also 
identified (PF-03702008). 
Impurities PF-00818977-01, PF-01458762, PF-01678282, PF-05188294, PF-05201372 and PF-05226216 were 
tested in a bacterial mutagenicity plate assay. The results of these studies indicated that PF-00818977, 
PF-01458762, PF-05201372 and PF-05226216 were not considered to be bacterial mutagens, while 
PF-01678282 and PF-05188294 were considered to be bacterial mutagens. 
Other impurities, PF-01038584, PF-05198214, PF-06238417, PF-06243812 and PF-06675793 were evaluated in 
an exploratory bacterial mutagenicity plate assay. PF-01395646, PF-01421674, PF-01731369 and PF-03949619 
were tested for mutagenic potential using only S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. PF-01731369, 
PF-03949619 and PF-06675793 were not considered to be bacterial mutagens. PF-01038584, PF-01395646, 
PF-01421674, PF-05198214, PF-06238417 and PF-06243812 were considered to be bacterial mutagens. 
The last group of impurities (PF-00219077, PF-02432182, PF-05188291, PF-05234782, PF-06239789, 
PF-06239795, PF-06272982, PF-06466351 and PF-06470418) was tested for mutagenic potential using S. 
typhimurium strains TA98lux and TA100lux. PF-00219077 and PF-06466351 were not considered to be bacterial 
mutagens with TA98lux or TA100lux. PF-02432182, PF-05188291, PF-05234782, PF-06239789, PF-06239795, 
PF-06272982 and PF-06470418 were considered to be bacterial mutagens. 
The metabolite M6 (PF-03702008) was detected both in rat and dog after dacomitinib administration. On the 
contrary, it was not formed in humans. 
Complementary to other toxicity studies, the applicant reported the potential haemolytic and phototoxicity 
effects of dacomitinib. After the analysis of the results, it resulted that dacomitinib did not cause haemolysis at 
a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL neither phototoxicity up to a single dose level of 100 mg/mL. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an Environmental Risk Assessment for dacomitinib, in accordance with CHMP guidance

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Dacomitinib  non-clinical  development  was  performed  in  accordance  with  current  guidelines  and  scientific 
requirements. 
The non-clinical aspects of dacomitinib were assessed in in vitro biochemical and cellular assays and in vivo 
xenograft, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity models. In vitro studies showed that dacomitinib 
inhibited the activity of HER family members and mutant variants.  In  vivo  studies presented an antitumour 
activity of dacomitinib in xenograft models. According to the in vitro data provided (Cross et al., 2014; Schwartz 
et al., 2014), dacomitinib showed a very similar profile to afatinib (a second generation TKI), having a more 
potent effect than gefinitib and erlotinib (first generation TKI) in terms of EGFR phosphorylation. Differences 
with  osimertinib  (third  generation  TKI)  were  also  observed  on  proliferative  efficacy,  although  potency  was 
dependent on the EGFR cell line analysed  (Cross et al., 2014  and Schwartz et  al.,  2014).  In these  studies, 
information on exposure levels in the xenograft models was however only presented for one model (SKOV3) and 
the study designs hampered the possibility to evaluate the effective dacomitinib exposure level in vivo. Thus, 
evaluation  of  the  optimal  biological  exposure  should  be  based  on  clinical  data.  Although  the  applicant  has 
described the pharmacological actions of dacomitinib, it should be considered that other EGFR-TKIs develop 
resistance after regular use, and understanding the resistance mechanisms to dacomitinib is currently limited. 
Besides, NSCLC is commonly associated to brain metastases. In this regard, it was reported (Endersby et al., 
2015  and  Zahonero  et  al.,  2015)  potential  pharmacological  actions  of  dacomitinib  on  preclinical  models  of 
glioblastoma, medulloblastoma and pineoblastoma.

The secondary and safety pharmacology studies conducted with dacomitinib, reported no relevant concerns. No 
separate in vivo safety pharmacology study has been performed with the human main metabolite PF-05199265. 
This is acceptable since the metabolite is formed by both rats and dogs and can be evaluated in repeat dose 
toxicity studies, although the method used for estimation of exposure of PF-05199265 has been questioned. 
However and taking into consideration that dacomitinib falls under the scope of ICH S9, the evidence that the 
metabolite has been detected in animal species used for toxicity testing is sufficient. 
The nonclinical PK profile of dacomitinib was evaluated mainly in rats and dogs. The characterisation included 
ADME properties, as well as correspondent metabolism (plasma protein binding properties, partitioning into red 
blood cells, hepatocyte uptake properties and drug metabolism). Results showed that while the accumulation 
ratios in dogs in most cases actually were in line with the estimated value based on half-life and dose interval, 
the  accumulation  ratios  in  rats  were  in  general  greater  than  what  was  predicted.  A  possibility  of  saturable 
clearance process(es) in rats following repeat dose administration cannot be excluded. It is however noted that 
although  toxicokinetic  data  from  the  6  month  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  in  rat  (6348-474)  indicated  drug 
accumulation during the first 90 days of the dosing phase, exposure on Day 180 was similar to that on Day 90. 
This  indicated  that  the  Day  180  exposure  levels  used  for  interspecies  comparison  were  representative  of  a 
steady  state  condition.  Quantifiable  concentrations  of 
the  main  metabolite  M18/PF-05199265 
(O-desmethylation) were obtained in rats and dogs, indicating that this metabolic pathway was present in both 
species. It is also observed that the dacomitinib exposure levels determined after 11 days of treatment in the 
EFD-study in rats (6348-475) support the assumption that much of the parent drug accumulation in rat may 
have occurred after only a few days of dacomitinib dose administration. Toxicokinetic data from repeat dose 
toxicity studies in dogs indicate a stable accumulation ratio for the parent compound over time. Taken together, 
the lack of information on exposure to important human metabolite(s) in pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies is 
considered a deficiency in the dossier. However, and given that this MAA is considered to fall under the scope of 
ICH S9; the evidence that the M18 metabolite (PF-05199265) indeed has been detected in animal species used 
for toxicity testing is sufficient. 
General  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  embryo-foetal  development,  potential  haemolysis,  and  phototoxicity  studies 
were conducted. 
In oral repeated-dose toxicity studies for up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs, the primary toxicities 
were identified in the skin/hair (dermal changes in rats and dogs, atrophy/dysplasia of hair follicles in rats), 
kidney (papillary necrosis often accompanied by tubular degeneration, regeneration, dilatation and/or atrophy 
and changes in urinary markers indicative of renal injury in rats, erosion or ulceration of the pelvic epithelium 
with associated inflammation without changes indicative of renal dysfunction in dogs), eye (cornea epithelial 
atrophy in rats and dogs, corneal ulcers/erosions with red/swollen conjunctiva(e), conjunctivitis, elevated third 
eyelid, increased squinting, partially closed eyes, lacrimation, and/or ocular discharge in dogs), and digestive 
system  (enteropathy  in  rats  and  dogs,  erosions/ulcers  of  the  mouth  with  reddened  mucous  membranes  in 
dogs),  and  atrophy  of  epithelial  cells  of  other  organs  in  rats. In  addition,  hepatocellular  necrosis  with 
transaminase increases and hepatocellular vacuolation were observed in rats only. These effects were reversible 
with the exception of hair follicles and kidney changes. All effects occurred at systemic exposure below that in 
humans at the recommended dose of 45 mg QD (see section 5.3 of the SmPC and RMP). 
Dacomitinib was tested using a series of genetic toxicology assays. Dacomitinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial 
reverse mutation (Ames) assay, and not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus 
assay in male and female rats. Dacomitinib was clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome 
aberration assay at cytotoxic concentrations. Dacomitinib is not directly reactive toward DNA as evidenced by 
the negative response in the bacterial reverse mutation assay and did not induce chromosome damage in a bone

marrow micronucleus assay at concentrations up to approximately 60-70 times the unbound AUC or Cmax at the 
recommended human dose. Dacomitinib is not expected to be genotoxic at clinically relevant exposure 
concentrations.  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dacomitinib which is considered acceptable in accordance 
with ICH S9. 
Fertility studies have not been performed with dacomitinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies with dacomitinib, 
effects on reproductive organs were observed in female rats given approximately 0.3 times the unbound AUC at 
the recommended human dose (for 6 months) and were limited to reversible epithelial atrophy in the cervix and 
vagina. 
There was no effect on reproductive organs in male rats given ≤ 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months (approximately 
1.1 times the unbound AUC at the recommended human dose), or in dogs given ≤ 1 mg/kg/day for 9 months 
(approximately 0.3 times the unbound AUC at the recommended human dose). 
Developmental  toxicity  effects  were  reported.  In  embryo-foetal  development  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits, 
pregnant animals received oral doses up to approximately 2.4 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the unbound 
AUC at the recommended human dose during the period of organogenesis. Maternal body weight gain and food 
intake were lower in pregnant rats and rabbits. The maternally toxic dose was foetotoxic in rats, resulting in 
reduced foetal body weights and higher incidence of unossified metatarsals  (see sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC). 
A phototoxicity study with dacomitinib in pigmented rats showed no phototoxicity potential. 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that dacomitinib has the potential to be very persistent, 
bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment (see sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  pharmacodynamics,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  aspects  of  dacomitinib  have  been 
assessed. From a non-clinical point of view, data submitted support the use of dacomitinib for the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  with  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor-activating 
mutations.

a.  Cohort B explored the utility of dacomitinib in HER2-amplified or HER2-mutated NSCLC in any line of therapy, and thus the results for this 
cohort are not summarized in this SCE, as they are not relevant to the proposed indication. 
b.  Study 1017 Cohort A had two dose groups:  (1) dacomitinib at a starting dose of 45 mg (N=59) and (2) dacomitinib at a starting dose of 
30 mg, increased to 45 mg after 2 cycles if the 30-mg dose was tolerated (N=30).  Numbers of patients shown in this table are for both dose 
groups combined. 
c.  Study 1050 is completed, ie, the final analysis of the primary endpoint has been completed and a CSRs is available.  At the time of this

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 21 clinical studies in 143 healthy volunteers and 1238 patients 
with various solid tumours. In addition, 25 in vitro studies were conducted on human biomaterials to 
characterize the pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib. Dacomitinib and the main metabolite PF-05199265 were 
determined in plasma and urine samples using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
detection (LC-MS/MS). 
Absorption  
The drug substance, dacomitinib monohydrate, is classified as a BCS class II drug, which means it is highly 
permeable and poorly soluble. In vitro studies indicate that dacomitinib is passively absorbed and is a weak to 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 46/144 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moderate substrate of the intestinal efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Concentration 
dependent efflux was observed over the studied concentration range (0.29-10.42 µM). 
In vivo, absorption was slow. Following the administration of a single 45 mg dose of dacomitinib tablets, the 
mean oral bioavailability of dacomitinib is 80% (90% CI: 74.9, 85.5) compared to intravenous administration, 
with Cmax occurring 5 to 6 hours after oral dosing. Following dacomitinib 45 mg daily dosing, steady-state was 
reached within 14 days (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
In a formal food effect study (Study 1015), after administration of dacomitinib to healthy subjects who had 
consumed a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, the ratios of adjusted geometric means for AUCinf and Cmax were 
1.14 and 1.24, respectively, compared to the fasted state. The 90% CI for AUCinf was within established 
bioequivalence criteria (80% to 125%).  
Distribution 
In plasma, dacomitinib binds to albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein and the fraction unbound is approximately 2% 
in vitro and ex vivo in healthy volunteers. In vitro data suggest approximately equal partitioning between human 
plasma and blood cells (blood:plasma ratio of 1.08). 
Dacomitinib distributes extensively outside plasma with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 1889 L 
(18% CV) following intravenous administration. The distribution to specific tissues in humans is not known. 
Dacomitinib appears not to be a substrate of the cellular transport proteins OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. It is 
not known whether dacomitinib is a substrate of other transporters involved in distribution. 
Elimination 
• 
Excretion  
In a mass balance study (A7471020) in 6 healthy male subjects given a single-oral dose of [14C] radiolabeled 
dacomitinib, a median of 82% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered in 552 hours; faeces (79% 
of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 3% of the dose recovered in urine, of which <1% of the 
administered dose was unchanged dacomitinib (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). The extent of biliary excretion has 
not been studied.  
• 
Metabolism  
Dacomitinib undergoes oxidation and glutathione conjugation as the major metabolic pathways. Following oral 
administration of a single 45-mg dose of [14C] dacomitinib (study A7471020), the most abundant circulating 
metabolite was O-desmethyl dacomitinib. This metabolite exhibited in vitro pharmacologic activity that was 
similar to that of dacomitinib in the in vitro biochemical assays. In faeces, dacomitinib, O-desmethyl dacomitinib, 
a cysteine conjugate of dacomitinib, and a mono-oxygenated metabolite of dacomitinib were the major 
drug-related components. In vitro studies indicated that CYP2D6 was the major CYP isozyme involved in the 
formation of O-desmethyl dacomitinib, while CYP3A4 contributed to the formation of other minor oxidative 
metabolites. O-desmethyl dacomitinib accounted for 16% of human plasma radioactivity and is formed mainly 
by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
The quantitative relative contributions of the elimination pathways to the total clearance of dacomitinib is not 
known.  
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 47/144 
  
  
Based on the available in vitro data, single dose in vivo data and a PBPK model (submitted during the procedure), 
the following quantitative relative contribution of involved enzymes/pathways to the total clearance of 
dacomitinib (scaled to 100%, based on 82% recovery in the mass balance study) has been proposed: 
Figure 6: Dacomitinib metabolism and disposition 
The PBPK model results indicated that following oral administration of dacomitinib (45 mg QD), the Day 1 
dynamic (time-variant) fm for CYP2D6 and CYP3A to dacomitinib clearance were 20% and 6.5%, respectively, 
in CYP2D6 EM subjects, and were 0% and 8.3%, respectively, in CYP2D6 PM subjects. The dynamic fm for 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 attributed to dacomitinib clearance at steady state were 13.9% and 7%, respectively, in 
CYP2D6 EM subjects, and 0% and 8.3%, respectively, in CYP2D6 PM subjects. The elimination half-life in 
patients ranged from 54 to 80 hours. Dacomitinib showed a clearance of around 20.0 L/hr with a 32% 
inter-individual variability (CV). 
PF-05199265 has inhibitory and selectivity profile similar to dacomitinib. However, the contribution of 
PF-05199265 to overall efficacy and safety after multiple dosing is expected to be minimal as the ratio to 
dacomitinib is low and the plasma fraction unbound is <0.01. The remaining metabolites were present in low 
contributions and are not expected to contribute to the pharmacological activity. 
In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (n=6), dacomitinib exposure (AUCtau) was 52% higher than in extensive 
metabolizers (n=33). In ultra-rapid metabolizers (n=3), exposure was 23% lower than in extensive 
metabolizers.  
• 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The PK analysis of PF-05199265 was based on pooled data (N=963) from 6 clinical trials in patients with 
advanced NSCLC and 8 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects. 
The population PK analysis of PF-05199265 was characterized using a 1-compartment PK model with the input 
rate of PF-05199265 formation as the individual post-hoc estimates of dacomitinib elimination rate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 48/144 
  
  
 
The final PF-05199265 PK model included a parameter to account for a decrease on the input rate of formation 
when dacomitinib was given in combination with a CYP2D6 inhibitor. The addition of this parameter indicated 
that in the presence of a CYP2D6 inhibitor the formation of metabolite is reduced 84% relative to the absence of 
concomitant use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, this observation is in agreement with the conclusions derived from Study 
A7471021. Furthermore, when a covariate on apparent metabolite clearance (CLm/F) after multiple dacomitinib 
dose administration was incorporated into the model indicating that after multiple daily doses of dacomitinib, the 
apparent clearance of PF-05199265 is increased by 106%.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Cmax and AUC24 versus dose data (2-60 mg) were analysed by log-log regression. After multiple dosing, the slope 
of Cmax versus dose was 1.083 (90% CI: 1.001, 1.166). The slope of AUCtau versus dose was 1.104 (90% CI: 
1.015, 1.192). Thus, there was a tendency to a greater than proportional increase in systemic exposure with 
increasing dose. Although the slope of the Cmax and AUCtau regressions were slightly greater than 1, PK generally 
appeared to be dose proportional. 
Following repeated dosing (once daily), steady state was reached within 14 days with exposure 5-6.4 times 
higher compared with single dose exposure. There was a marked difference in the ratio of PF-05199265 to 
dacomitinib in plasma after single dose (0.23-0.52) and at steady state (0.08). Graphical data indicated a 
modest, but systematic decrease in dacomitinib exposure (Ctrough) over time (first six cycles). 
Inter- and intra-individual variability 
Based on non-compartmental analysis, inter-individual variability (CV%) after a 45 mg dose in patients ranged 
from 51% to 70% in Cmax and from 31% to 45% in AUCinf.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, total inter-individual variability was estimated to be 35% in 
clearance, 33% in central volume of distribution, 47% in the peripheral volume of distribution and 121% in the 
absorption rate constant (prior to inclusion of covariates partly explaining total variability).

Special populations 
A population PK analysis was conducted by the use of nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM v. 7.3) to 
characterise the PK of dacomitinib and to evaluate the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK. The 
analysis included data from eight studies in healthy subjects and 13 studies in patients with different solid 
tumours, in total 1,435 subjects (11,751 observations; of which 13.5% were dropped for various and not fully 
justified reasons). 
The PK of dacomitinib were described by a two-compartment disposition model with first order absorption and 
elimination. Covariates associated with a significant increase in clearance included increasing body weight (as a 
predefined covariate using a power function with an allometric exponent of 0.75), male gender, Asian race, 
baseline aspartate aminotransferase, baseline serum albumin, EGFR activating mutations and not using a 
CYP2D6 inhibitor. Age, healthy subject vs. patient, smoking history, ECOG status (0/1), creatinine clearance, 
baseline bilirubin, baseline tumour type and baseline hepatic impairment grade did not significantly impact on 
the clearance of dacomitinib. Food intake was a significant covariate increasing the absorption rate. No 
covariates were identified to influence the volume of distribution. An effect of body weight on CL and volume of 
distribution was predefined in the modelling analysis plan, and included in the final model.

Renal impairment 
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with impaired renal function.  
Hepatic impairment 
In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial (A7471018), following a single-oral dose of 30 mg Vizimpro, dacomitinib 
exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) was unchanged in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A; N=8) and decreased by 15% 
and 20%, respectively in moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B; N=9) when compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function (N=8). Dacomitinib pharmacokinetics has not been studied in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis using data 
from 1381 patients, that included 158 patients with mild hepatic impairment defined by National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) criteria [total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase 
(AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST; N=158], mild hepatic impairment had no effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib. From the small number of patients in the moderate group [total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 × ULN and any AST; N=5], there is no evidence for a change in dacomitinib 
pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Body weight, gender, race, and age  
The effects of body weight, gender, race and age was evaluated using population PK analysis. The data 
supported the predefined inclusion of body weight as a covariate on clearance. The allometric scaling model 
predicted 55% higher clearance in 90 kg subjects compared with 50 kg subjects. Female subjects were 
estimated to have 11.5% lower clearance than males, and Asian subjects were estimated to have 8.5% higher 
clearance than White subjects. There was no significant effect of age on dacomitinib clearance. Approximately 
9.5% of the population included in the dacomitinib PK dataset were aged ≥75 years.

Dacomitinib has not been studied in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of other substances on dacomitinib exposure 
The absorption of dacomitinib decreases with increasing pH.  In vivo, co-administration of a single 45 mg 
dacomitinib dose with the PPI rabeprazole 40 mg once daily for 7 days decreased dacomitinib Cmax, AUC0-96h 
(area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 96 hours), and AUCinf (AUC from time 0 to infinity) 
(n=14) by approximately 51%, 39%, and 29%, respectively, when compared to a single 45 mg dose of 
dacomitinib administered alone.  (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 53/144 
  
  
 
Dacomitinib has been shown to be a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in vitro. One in vivo 
interaction study was performed to assess the effect of the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine on dacomitinib 
PK. Daily dosing of paroxetine 30 mg led to a 37% increase in dacomitinib AUCinf and a 10% increase in 
dacomitinib Cmax. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended for dacomitinib upon concomitant 
administration with a CYP2D6 inhibitor. 
Based on data from observations in 8 patients in Study A7471001, there was no apparent effect of local antacid 
administration on Cmax and AUCinf of dacomitinib. Based on pooled data in patients, there was no apparent effect 
of histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists on steady-state trough concentration of dacomitinib (geometric mean 
ratio of 86% (90% CI: 73; 101). 
Effects of dacomitinib on other substances 
In vivo, co-administration of single 45 mg oral dose of dacomitinib increased the mean exposure (AUClast and 
Cmax) of dextromethorphan, a probe CYP2D6 substrate, 855% and 874%, respectively, compared with 
administration of dextromethorphan alone. 
Among the studied transporters in vitro, dacomitinib showed a low potential to inhibit P-gp (systemically), 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. However, dacomitinib 
may have the potential to inhibit OCT1 (Ki 0.25 μM), systemic BCRP (Ki 0.25 μM), intestinal BCRP (Ki 0.25 μM) 
and intestinal P-gp (Ki 3.87 μM). 
In human hepatocytes, dacomitinib did not induce CYP3A4, 2B6 or 1A2 mRNA or enzymatic activity at 
concentrations up to 3 μM (>50x of the unbound Cmax at steady state 45 mg QD). 
In vitro direct inhibition and time-dependent inhibition studies were performed in human liver microsomes. 
There was no relevant inhibition of CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A or UGT 1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7 and 
2B15. For CYP2D6, a potentially clinically relevant direct inhibition was observed (unbound Cmax/Ki ratio 
was >0.02 [based on The “Basic Model” from the EMA Guideline on drug interactions to assess the risk of in vivo 
DDIs]).  
The main metabolite PF-05199265 was not found to be a potential inhibitor of CYP enzymes in vitro except for 
potential CYP2D6 inhibition. The interaction potential with PF-05199265 was not further tested because its ratio 
to dacomitinib at steady state was <25%. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
After multiple 45 mg dose administration and steady state achievement (14 days) the geometric mean exposure 
ranged from 1505 to 2166 ng•h/mL for AUCtau and from 74.2 to 105.1 ng/mL for Cmax. Maximum exposure 
observed after this regimen was approximately 240 ng/mL and 4700 ng•h/mL, respectively (according to 
graphical presentations of exposure, Figures 8 and 9 in Module 2.7.2). 
For the main metabolite PF-05199265, the geometric mean Cmax was 6.58 ng/mL and the geometric mean 
AUCtau was 141 ng•h/mL on Cycle 2 Day 1 after 45 mg QD dosing.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dacomitinib is a selective, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive, irreversible, small-molecule inhibitor of 
the human epidermal receptor, also called ERBB (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including 
epidermal growth factor receptor, also called HER1 or ERBB1 (EGFR), human epidermal receptor 2, also called 
ERBB2 (HER2), human epidermal receptor 4, also called ERBB4 (HER4), and their oncogenic variants (ie, EGFR 
with exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation). Dacomitinib inhibited the activity of HER1, HER2, and HER4 
in biochemical kinase assays, demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of the HER1 and HER2 RTK 
phosphorylation in tumour xenografts expressing these RTK targets in vivo, and demonstrated inhibition of 
tumour growth or tumour regression in experimental models of cancer. The irreversible mode of action leads to 
prolonged inhibition of EGFR kinase activity. 
The O-desmethyl metabolite (PF-05199265) is also a potent inhibitor of the EGFR kinase family in vitro.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The relationships between dacomitinib exposure and efficacy endpoints were explored, ie, E-R analyses; the E-R 
analyses included only the dacomitinib-treated patients. Similarly, this E-R analysis explored intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors as potential predictors of response and intended to characterize, if any, the relationship 
between dacomitinib exposure and the efficacy measurements. 
Secondary pharmacology 
To evaluate the effect of dacomitinib on QT interval prolongation, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
relationship between dacomitinib or PF-05199265 concentrations and electrocardiogram (ECG) data was 
developed based on data collected from Study 1047. In this analysis, dacomitinib was found to have an effect on 
RR intervals with 90% CI for the slope excluding the null values. However, the 95% CI for the slope estimate 
included the null value suggesting that the relationship between dacomitinib plasma concentrations and the RR 
interval is negligible. PF-05199265 was not found to affect RR intervals. Therefore, the formulas that would 
generate QTc values that were independent of the underlying heart rate were selected for the analysis. The 
correction factors QTcF, QTcB and QTcS were investigated. Of these, QTcS was determined to be the most 
appropriate correction factor. Based on the results of these analyses, an exposure-dependent increase in mean 
QTc was not observed at concentrations of dacomitinib and PF-05199265 achieved in this study, which were 
representative of expected concentrations with 45 mg QD dosing. 
All data available concerning the mechanism of action are from nonclinical studies, and no specific clinical 
pharmacology studies have been performed to qualify the suggested mechanism of action. PD was investigated 
as a secondary, mostly exploratory objective in several studies. The phase II studies A7471017 
(proof-of-concept) and A7471047 investigated the efficacy of dacomitinib in EGFR activation mutation-positive 
NSCLC and T790M positive NSCLC, respectively. QT prolongation was investigated in study A7471047. A PKPD 
modelling approach was used to further investigate the effect of dacomitinib on the QT interval in NSCLC 
patients (PMAR-EQDD-A747f-DP4-617).

Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
The exposure-efficacy relationship was investigated based on data from 268 patients in Study 1050 (pivotal 
Phase III) and Study 1017 (Phase II), where the majority (94%) were started on 45 mg dacomitinib daily and 
93% had only predose PK sampling. The data were analysed with logistic regression modelling and 
time-to-event modelling. No clear relationships between dacomitinib exposure (as estimated based on the 
individual PK parameter estimates in the population PK analysis) and objective response (OR) or 
progression-free survival (PFS) were established over the exposure range studied. The final time-to-event 
model identified decreasing average concentration (Cavg) of dacomitinib, increasing albumin, decreasing lactate 
dehydrogenase and increasing maximum grade of the adverse events rash/dermatitis acneiform and other skin 
toxicities as significant predictors of increasing PFS. 
In a sub-analysis including patients who did not change dacomitinib dose levels during treatment (88 subjects 
on 45 mg QD and 8 on 30 mg), dacomitinib exposure was not a significant predictor of PFS. Importantly, in a 
similar analysis based on only patients continuing on 45 mg QD in Study 1050, and which included the gefitinib 
arm, choice of treatment (dacomitinib vs. gefitinib) was not a significant predictor of PFS, and the HR between 
the arms was close to 1 (0.97; 95% CI 0.81-1.19). 
Exposure-safety relationship 
The relationship between dacomitinib exposure and selected cluster safety endpoints were evaluated using 
logistic regression and time-to-event modelling. Only the logistic regression modelling results are presented 
here, as the results were generally similar. Simulations based on these models indicated that increasing 
exposure to dacomitinib increased the probability of experiencing Grade ≥3 skin toxicities and diarrhoea and 
Grade ≥1 stomatitis (Table 19).

Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the potential effect of Race and/or EGFR mutation subtype on 
the probability of experiencing each of the safety endpoints evaluated. Race was a covariate considered in the 
initial stepwise covariate modelling and it did not result in a statistically significant improvement to the model fit 
[measured using deviance (Agresti, 2003)]. This indicates that Race is not a significant covariate and does not 
have any effect on the probability of each of the AE endpoints. EGFR mutation subtype was evaluated by 
dichotomising the exon 19 deletion and exon 21 mutation. Mutation subtype (ref=exon 19 deletion, test=exon 
21 mutation) was added to each of the final logistic regression models (using dacomitinib exposure) and the

model was re-estimated. In every model, the mutation subtype was not statistically significant at a p=0.05 
significance level. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the in vitro absorption studies (see section 2.3.3), dacomitinib showed to be a weak to moderate substrate for 
MDR1 and BCRP, with concentration dependent saturation of efflux (at concentrations >2 µM). Due to high 
bioavailability (see below) no major clinical implications of increased bioavailability due to genetically 
determined reduced BCRP activity or inhibition of P-gp/BCRP are expected.   
The mean oral bioavailability was estimated to be 80%, ranging the dose-normalised AUCinf of test/reference 
from 65.3% to 100%. Food does not alter bioavailability to a clinically meaningful extent. Dacomitinib is a 
substrate for the membrane transport proteins P-gp and BCRP. However, based on the oral bioavailability of 
80%, these membrane transport proteins are unlikely to have any impact on dacomitinib absorption (see 
section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
There was large inter-individual variability in the absorption rate and tmax. However, individual differences in 
absorption rate are not expected to be clinically relevant as long as the bioavailability fraction remains 
unchanged and Cmax is not the primary driver of clinical efficacy or adverse event probability (which was 
indicated by the exposure-response analyses).  
Proton pump inhibitors reduced exposure to dacomitinib by 50% on Cmax and 30% on AUC, and the applicant 
suggests that co-administration with these agents should not be recommended. Although there is no apparent 
exposure-response relationship, a clinically relevant impact of a reduced exposure cannot be ruled out. The 
effect of H2 receptor antagonists on dacomitinib exposure has not been studied. Based on physiology and 
knowledge from other molecular targeted agents with pH-dependent absorption (e.g. erlotinib), a staggered 
dosing approach (administration of dacomitinib at least 2 hours before or 10 hours after H2 receptor antagonist 
administration) would allow dacomitinib absorption at the time of lowest gastric pH and thereby minimize the 
extent of this potential interaction.  
The potential distribution of dacomitinib to the CNS is relevant to predict the potential effect of dacomitinib on 
CNS metastases, considering the dacomitinib properties (moderate permeability, weak substrate of P-gp and 
BCRP). However, there is limited information available on dacomitinib PK in brain tissue as well as the impact of 
genetic polymorphism of the main CNS efflux transporters. Evaluation of clinical impact is thus limited to clinical 
empirical evidence. 
In the mass-balance study, only 82% of the administered dose was recovered, which is relatively low. Although 
the elimination pathways have not been fully elucidated, the main routes of elimination following dacomitinib 
administration have been adequately characterised.  The available PK data in CYP2D6 poor and ultra-rapid 
metabolizers were very limited. However, they do indicate only modest differences between these 
subpopulations and CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. The drug interaction study of co-administration with the 
strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine indicated no clinically relevant effects on dacomitinib, which may be viewed 
as an estimation of expected exposure in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Together, these data indicate that the 
fractional metabolism by CYP2D6 is relatively low (<50%) and that no clinical consequences are expected from 
standard dosing across genotype subgroups to an extent that justifies pre-treatment genotyping. No dose 
adjustment is recommended for dacomitinib upon concomitant administration with a CYP2D6 inhibitor. 
There was a tendency to a greater than proportional increase in exposure with increasing dose. The underlying 
mechanism may be that higher dacomitinib exposure leads to CYP2D6, P-gp and/or BCRP (proteins that 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 57/144 
  
  
dacomitinib both inhibit and is a substrate of). Since the coefficients for the slopes were only slightly above 1 
(AUC point estimates of 1.21 and 1.10 after single and multiple dosing, respectively), the potential nonlinearity 
may not be clinically relevant over the dose range studied.  
Based on the marked time-dependent changes in the dacomitinib-to-PF-05199265 ratio, it appears that the 
CYP2D6 fm values are time-dependent, possibly due to concentration-dependent CYP2D6 auto-inhibition. This 
has implications for the interpretation of metabolism and interaction studies performed after single dose 
administration, but is likely not to have important clinical consequences.  
The graphical data suggested a modest, but systematic decrease in Ctrough values but the statistical analysis did 
not conclude on any time-related trend. 
Findings from the population PK justifies not performing a dedicated renal impairment study which is acceptable. 
The applied methods for population pharmacokinetic modelling were overall adequate and standard model 
building techniques were applied. The exclusion of the majority (74.2%) of observations was either prespecified 
in the analysis plan, or due to incomplete information or abnormally high or low observations. 
The final model was validated using prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPCs). All pcVPCs were 
generated using 1000 simulations, which is considered adequate.  
The population pharmacokinetic approach is generally an acceptable method to assess the effect of renal 
function and it is accepted that a dedicated study is not performed. Based on population pharmacokinetic 
analyses, mild (60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min; N=590) and moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min; 
N=218) renal impairment, did not alter dacomitinib pharmacokinetics, relative to subjects with normal 
(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min; N=567) renal function. The pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or requiring haemodialysis have not been studied. No dose adjustments are 
needed for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC).. 
A dedicated hepatic impairment clinical study of dacomitinib showed no change in AUC in subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment and a 15% decrease in moderate hepatic impaired patients. Thus, the administration of 
dacomitinib did not show any clinically relevant impact on dacomitinib exposure in mild or moderate hepatic 
impaired patients and no starting dose adjustments are required (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). The applicant 
has committed to submit the results of a new clinical study investigating the impact on severely impaired hepatic 
function on dacomitinib and metabolite (PF-05199265) PK within Q1 2022. Only subjects identified as extensive 
metabolisers or intermediate metabolisers of CYP2D6 will be included in the primary statistical analysis of the 
study (see RMP). Treatment in this population is not recommended. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, patient age, race (Asian and non-Asian), gender, and body 
weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on predicted steady-state exposure of dacomitinib. Approximately 
90% of patients included in this analysis were Asian or White. No starting dose adjustment of dacomitinib is 
needed in these patient populations. 
The safety and efficacy of Vizimpro in the paediatric population (< 18 years of age) have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Dacomitinib was a substrate of the intestinal efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Inhibition of these transporters 
in vivo may result in increased dacomitinib exposure. However, since the mean bioavailability of dacomitinib was 
80%, the potential increase in absorption extent is limited (~ 1/4 higher exposure may be expected in case of 
complete inhibition in an average patient), and it is supported that this finding was not pursued by in vivo 
studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 58/144 
  
  
Co-administration of dacomitinib with PPI rabeprazole significantly decreased dacomitinib Cmax and AUC0-96h. 
Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) with dacomitinib should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 
of the SmPC). Local antacids and H2 receptor antagonists may be used if needed. Dacomitinib should be 
administered 2 hours before or at least 10 hours after taking H2 receptor antagonists. 
Dacomitinib is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor and may increase exposure (or decrease exposure of active 
metabolites) of other medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of medicinal products 
predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 should be avoided unless such products are considered necessary (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). H2 receptor antagonists should be administered 2 hours before or at least 10 
hours after taking dacomitinib. Dacomitinib may increase exposure of other medicinal products (or decrease 
exposure to active metabolites) primarily metabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) with dacomitinib should be avoided 
Based on in vitro data, dacomitinib may have the potential to inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (in the 
gastrointestinal [GI] tract), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) (systemically and GI tract), and organic 
cation transporter (OCT)1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Efficacy in NSCLC EGFR activating mutations has been demonstrated in the pivotal study (A7471050) where 
dacomitinib was shown to be superior to gefitinib in prolonging PFS in the overall target population. Considering 
that most NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutations who initially respond to first generation TKIs relapse, 
the presumed activity of dacomitinib towards the acquired T790M mutation is of particular interest. The results 
from studies A7471047 and A7471002 indicate that the benefit in patients with T790M mutations in EGFR might 
be limited. In several clinical studies, secondary objectives have included exploratory investigations of 
biomarkers/pharmacogenomics. The knowledge on molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to first- and 
second-line EGFR TKI therapy are evolving. Molecular alterations triggering resistance may alter the drug target 
itself or activate alternate signal transduction pathways. However, the potential benefit of dacomitinib in the 
treatment of T790M-mediated EGFR TKI resistant NSCLC has not been sufficiently investigated in the clinical 
setting. Clinical data for dacomitinib activity in patients with EGFR T790M are not currently available.   
Overall, based on the available nonclinical and clinical data the risk of QT prolongation is considered low. 
The PK data indicate that the clinical activity of the O-desmethyl metabolite (PF-05199265) is negligible. 
Exposure-response relationships 
No clear relationship between dacomitinib exposure and efficacy could be characterized over the exposure range 
studied. Increasing exposure to dacomitinib (Cavg, overall) was significantly associated with shorter PFS, which is 
opposite of what is theoretically expected. Furthermore, although there was a clear difference in median PFS for 
Asian (18.2 months) and Non-Asian (10.9 months) patients in the raw data subgroup analyses for Study 1050, 
race was not identified as a significant covariate in the modelling analysis based on mostly the same data. The 
covariate skin toxicity, which is correlated with both race and exposure, was not shown to have confounded the 
underlying relationship between dacomitinib exposure and efficacy and between race and efficacy. 
Significant exposure-safety relationship was defined for Grade ≥3 rash/dermatitis acneiform, other skin 
toxicities, diarrhoea and Grade ≥1 stomatitis.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology of dacomitinib has been comprehensively characterised and all relevant 
information has been included in the PI.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
The applicant will submit the results from a new clinical study investigating the impact on severely impaired 
hepatic function on dacomitinib and metabolite (PF-05199265) PK by Q1 2022 (see RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of dacomitinib in the proposed indication is primarily supported by the outcome of the pivotal Study 
A7471050 (1050), a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 pivotal study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line 
treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. In addition, 
there was 1 key supportive study (A7471017 Cohort A) of dacomitinib as first-line treatment and 3 other 
supportive studies (A7471009, A7471028, and A7471011 [also known as Study BR.26]) in later lines of therapy. 
All 5 studies have been completed (the final analysis of the primary endpoint has been completed). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal Phase 2 dose finding studies were performed and no dose/exposure-response modelling was 
conducted prior to Phase 3. In Study 1001, dacomitinib was administered to patients at doses ranging from 0.5 
to 60 mg. Dacomitinib 45 mg QD was determined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Study 1001, and 
confirmed in Study 1003 and Study 1005. Dacomitinib at a dose of 45 mg QD in NSCLC has been further 
investigated and confirmed in Phase 2 (Studies 1002, 1017, 1028, and 1042) and Phase 3 (Studies 1009, 1011, 
and 1050) clinical studies of efficacy and safety.

Treatments 
Patients received open-label study treatment and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 2 
treatment arms: 
 Investigational treatment: dacomitinib 45 mg PO once daily; 
 Comparator treatment: gefitinib 250 mg PO once daily. 
Treatment was administered until disease progression, institution of new anticancer therapy, intolerable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, death, or investigator decision dictated by protocol compliance, whichever occurred first. 
Study treatment was administered for up to 48 months. 
At the time of progression and termination of study treatment, the patients could receive any regulatory 
approved therapy (i.e. not another EGFR-TKI) at the judgment of the investigator. Patients who had progressive 
disease (PD) (per RECIST v1.1, by IRC review) and for whom the investigator believed it was in their best 
interest to continue on their respective study therapy were allowed to continue on their respective study therapy, 
with or without local therapy (eg, surgical removal and/or radiation of a single lesion), at the discretion of the 
investigator and in agreement with the Sponsor, until any alternate or additional systemic anti-cancer therapy 
regimen was implemented.  
Crossover of patients from one treatment arm to the other after disease progression was not allowed. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective:  
To demonstrate that dacomitinib treatment was superior to gefitinib treatment with respect to 
progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by blinded Independent Radiologic Central (IRC) review, 
in the study population.  
Key Secondary Objective:  
o  To compare OS, and objective response rate (ORR) as determined by blinded IRC review and 
investigator assessment (INV), between the 2treatment arms. 
o  To compare the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
disease/treatment-related symptoms between the 2 treatment arms; 
o  To compare the PRO of health status between the 2 treatment arms; 
o  To evaluate the safety and tolerability between the 2 treatment arms; 
o  To compare PFS as determined by INV, and duration of response (DoR) both as determined by blinded 
IRC review and INV between the 2 treatment arms; 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS by RECIST v1.1 as determined by blinded IRC review. PFS was defined 
as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression by RECIST v1.1.  
Secondary endpoints included: 
-  OS

Patient-reported outcome (PRO). 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS as determined by blinded IRC review. It was estimated that 
approximately 440 randomized patients and a minimum of 256 PFS events would be required to achieve a 90% 
power to detect a ≥50% improvement in PFS (ie, this translated to an improvement in median PFS from 9.5 to 
at least 14.3 months) in patients randomized to receive dacomitinib versus those randomized to receive gefitinib 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) Population (ie, HR ≤0.667, using a stratified log-rank test at 1-sided α=0.025, a 1:1 
randomization and a censoring rate of approximately 42%). At the end of the study, the primary analysis tested 
the HR (dacomitinib/gefitinib) ≥1 versus <1 using a 1-sided stratified log-rank test. The study was to be 
considered a positive study if the 1-sided stratified log-rank test for PFS was significant at the 0.025 level at the 
time of the final PFS analysis. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the dacomitinib arm or the gefitinib arm. Randomization 
was stratified by 2 factors: race (Japanese vs mainland Chinese vs other East Asian vs non-East Asian, as 
reported by the patient) and EGFR-activating mutation status (exon 19 deletion versus the L858R mutation in 
exon 21). Of note, all Asian patients enrolled in Study 1050 were East Asian; therefore the non-East Asian 
patient subgroup in Study 1050 was equivalent to a non-Asian population. Japanese and mainland Chinese were 
selected as stratification factors due to local regulatory requirements. 
A central Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) was used for patient enrollment at the time of informed 
consent and randomization, as well as for drug management. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label.

Statistical methods

patient-reported outcomes in pivotal study A7471050 
There was an Interim analysis of OS at the time of final analysis for PFS for futility only. A gatekeeping procedure 
was used for hypotheses testing in a hierarchical approach to control the family-wise error rate for the analyses 
of primary endpoint, and key secondary endpoints of ORR per IRC review and OS. The null hypothesis for the 
primary endpoint was rejected. However, the null hypothesis for ORR was not rejected, and formal hypothesis 
testing for OS was therefore not to be conducted and the null hypothesis of equal OS is therefore not rejected.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 10: Chart of participant flow 
The study completed its enrolment on 25 March 2015 with 452 patients randomized (ITT Population). Of these, 
227 (100%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 224 (99.6%) patients in the gefitinib arm received at least 1 
dose of study treatment (AT Population). One (1) patient in the gefitinib arm was randomized but did not receive 
study treatment. 
In the ITT Population, by the data cutoff date of 29 July 2016 the majority of patients in each treatment arm had 
permanently discontinued from treatment (70.9% in the dacomitinib arm and 82.7% in the gefitinib arm) and 
40.1% of patients in the dacomitinib arm and 46.7% of patients in the gefitinib arm had discontinued from the 
study. 
The most common reasons for permanent discontinuation were objective progression or relapse (34.8% 
dacomitinib vs. 50.4% gefitinib), global deterioration of health (11.5% dacomitinib vs. 14.7%), and TEAEs (17.6%

dacomitinib vs. 12.1% gefitinib). 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 90 study sites worldwide. Countries with study sites that randomized patients into 
the study were China (21 sites), Hong Kong (2 sites), Italy (13 sites), Japan (10 sites), Poland (3 sites), Republic 
of Korea (5 sites), and Spain (17 sites). 
Conduct of the study 
Several amendments to the original protocol were implemented. The amendments are not considered to have 
affected the outcome of the study. 
A summary of major/critical protocol deviations is reported in the Table below.  
The major/critical protocol deviations identified in the study fell into 3 categories: 
• 
• 
• 
Patients who entered the study even though they did not strictly meet eligibility criteria. 
Patients who received incorrect treatment or dose of the study drug(s). 
Patients who did not participate in study assessments as required by the protocol.

– ITT population 
Table 24: Summary of Biomarker Status at Randomization, ITT Population 
Patients in study 1050 had Stage III/IV NSCLC at study entry (either newly diagnosed or recurrent disease) . 
Most patients in the dacomitinib arm and the gefitinib arm had an initial disease stage of Stage IV (181 patients 
[79.7%] and 183 patients [81.3%], respectively) and a current disease stage of Stage IV (184 patients [81.1%] 
and 183 patients [81.3%], respectively).  
All patients had a histological status of adenocarcinoma. Most patients were randomised into the study within a 
month after initial diagnosis.

Four (4) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 1 patient in the gefitinib arm did not have a biopsy prior to study 
entry provided for EGFR mutation evaluation, as a deviation to the protocol. 
In Study 1050, a total of 4 patients (0.9%; 2 in each treatment arm) had received prior systemic treatment; 
each of these patients received 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. 
Of these 4 patients, 2 (1 patient in each treatment arm) had received adjuvant systemic treatment for an earlier 
stage of NSCLC as permitted by the protocol, and 2 (1 patient in each treatment arm) were initially treated for 
Stage IV NSCLC with disease recurrence prior to entering the study and, according to the protocol, would have 
been ineligible for enrollment and treatment. Few patients in Study 1050 had previously undergone surgery (9.3% 
in the dacomitinib arm and 8.4% in the gefitinib arm) or radiation treatment (3.1% in the dacomitinib arm and 
2.7% in the gefitinib arm). 
The vast majority of patients reported concomitant drug use (224 [98.7%] in the dacomitinib arm and 213 
[95.1%] in the gefitinib arm). The 3 most frequently reported concomitant drug treatments in the dacomitinib 
arm were loperamide (111 patients [48.9%]), herbal preparation/Traditional Chinese Medicine (64 patients 
[28.2%]), and dexamethasone (62 patients [27.3%]). The 3 most frequently reported concomitant drug 
treatments in the gefitinib arm were herbal preparation/Traditional Chinese Medicine (66 patients [29.5%]), 
dexamethasone (50 patients [22.3%]), and paracetamol (49 patients [21.9%]).  
In relation to subsequent systemic therapy (SST), 113 (49.8%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 140 (62.2%) 
in the gefitinib arm received SST. The median SST was 2 (range: 1 to 7) in the dacomitinib group and 1 (range: 
1 to 8) in the gefitinib group. Pemetrexed, cisplatin and carboplatin were the most frequent SST in both 
treatment arms. Osimertinib was the EGFR-TKI most commonly used as SST (14.1% dacomitinib vs. 20.9% 
gefitinib).

Supportive Analyses of the Primary Endpoint 
The robustness and consistency of the primary efficacy results were investigated in various sensitivity analyses. 
Overall, the results of these analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Analysis of the Primary Endpoint Not Censoring New Anti-Cancer Treatment. 
Twenty-three (23) patients (10.1%) in the dacomitinib arm and 18 patients (8.0%) in the gefitinib arm were 
censored in the primary analysis for new anti-cancer treatment given prior to tumour progression. Overall, 137 
patients (60.4%) in the dacomitinib arm and 181 patients (80.4%) in the gefitinib arm had a PFS event as of the 
data cutoff date. The HR of dacomitinib versus gefitinib not censoring new anti-cancer treatment was 0.582 (95% 
CI: 0.464, 0.729; 1-sided p<0.0001) based on the stratified analysis. The HR of dacomitinib versus gefitinib was 
0.573 (95% CI: 0.458, 0.718; 1-sided p<0.0001) based on the unstratified analysis. The estimated median PFS 
was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.3, 17.5) for the dacomitinib arm and 9.3 months (95% CI: 9.2, 11.0) for the 
gefitinib arm.

The ORRs per investigator assessment for patients in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms were similar to those 
per IRC review: 75.3% (95% CI: 69.2, 80.8) and 70.2% (95% CI: 63.8, 76.1), respectively; stratified 1-sided 
p-value=0.0924 based on the CMH test stratified by EGFR mutation status (based on values at randomisation) 
and by race.

The DoR HR for responders per investigator review for dacomitinib versus gefitinib was 0.545 (95% CI: 0.418, 
0.711; 1-sided p-value<0.0001) based on the stratified analysis. 
  Overall survival 
A pre-specified interim analysis (IA) of OS was conducted at the time of final PFS analysis (29 July 2016) as 
specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The study passed the IA of OS for futility with 167 (36.9%) OS observed 
events with a HR of 0.759 (95% CI: 0.559, 1.031; 1-sided p-value=0.0381). Neither treatment arm had 
reached the median due to immature data by the data cut-off date.  
The final analysis of OS in Study 1050 was conducted based on 220 (48.7%) deaths among 452 patients as of 
the 17 February 2017 data cutoff date. The median follow-up time for all 452 randomised patients in Study 1050 
was 31.3 months (95% CI: 30.9, 31.9). 
While the final readout of OS was statistically significant when assessed on its own, since the gate-keeping 
procedure stopped at the testing of ORR (per IRC review) as ORR was not statistically significant, the final 
readout of OS was not considered to be statistically significant.

Supportive Analyses of overall survival 
Analysis of the Overall Survival Censoring at First Subsequent Therapy 
Pre-specified analyses of OS (censoring patients at the date of initiation at first subsequent therapy for those 
who received at least 1 subsequent therapy) were conducted to mitigate the confounding impact of subsequent 
therapies on OS. The estimated OS HR was 0.739 (95% CI: 0.489, 1.115) with a 1-sided p-value of 0.0737 
based on stratified analysis, indicating a 26.1% reduction in the risk of death in favour of the dacomitinib arm. 
First subsequent therapy during active treatment or follow-up was defined as the first systemic therapy, 
radiation therapy with curative intent, or surgery with curative intent. 
The robustness and consistency of the OS-data were investigated in several other sensitivity analyses. 
 
Time to treatment failure 
Overall, 168 patients (74.0%) in the dacomitinib arm and 197 patients (87.6%) in the gefitinib arm reached a 
treatment failure event. TTF by blinded IRC review demonstrated an improvement with dacomitinib as 
compared with gefitinib (HR=0.670 [95% CI: 0.543, 0.826; 1 sided p-value<0.0001] based on the stratified 
analysis and HR=0.664 [95% CI: 0.539, 0.817; 1 sided p-value<0.0001] based on the unstratified analysis). 
The estimated median TTF was 11.1 months (95% CI: 9.2, 14.6) for the dacomitinib arm and 9.2 months (95% 
CI: 7.6, 9.4) for the gefitinib arm.

Figure 16: Kaplan-Meier plot of TTF based on independent review – ITT population 
TTF HR based on investigator assessment for dacomitinib versus gefitinib was 0.695 (95% CI: 0.563, 0.858; 
1-sided p-value=0.0003) based on the stratified analysis. The estimated median TTF was 13.0 months (95% CI: 
11.1, 16.6) for the dacomitinib arm and 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.3, 11.1) for the gefitinib arm. 
 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
The rates of completion were high with >90% of patients answering all questions in almost all cycles for the 
EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-LC13, and EQ-5D questionnaires in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms.  
There was no statistically significant difference in TTD between the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms with respect 
to pain (in chest or arm/shoulder), dyspnea, fatigue, or cough as a composite endpoint (HR 1.173 [CI 95%: 
0.928, 1.483]), nor its individual symptom items. The sensitive analysis confirmed the primary analysis. 
In the dacomitinib arm, there was no statistically significant change from baseline observed for overall global 
QoL. In the gefitinib arm, a statistically significant improvement was seen in change from baselines (p<0.0001), 
but did not reach the 10-point threshold of being clinically meaningful. A statistically significant difference in 
global quality of life was observed between the two treatment groups, favouring gefitinib (P=0.0002). 
The change from baseline in general health status as measured by EQ-5D/VAS was found to be statistically 
significantly lower in the dacomitinib arm compared with the gefitinib arm (p value=0.0008).

Study A7471017 Cohort A 
Study 1017 was a multinational, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 2 clinical study of dacomitinib in patients with 
NSCLC genotypically selected for the presence of an EGFR-activating mutation or phenotypically selected as 
having the highest likelihood of having the EGFR-activating mutation (Cohort A) or for the presence of HER2 
gene amplification or HER2 mutation (Cohort B). Only Cohort A is included in this SCE, as this cohort only 
enrolled patients who had untreated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. 
Patients received dacomitinib PO at a starting dose of 45 mg or 30 mg QD. The latter group increased their dose 
to 45 mg QD after 2 cycles if the 30 mg dose was tolerated according to the investigator.  
  Study population 
Cohort A included male or female patients ≥18 years of age with adenocarcinoma of the lung who had not 
received prior systemic therapy and were either 1) non-smokers or former light smokers, or 2) patients, 
regardless of smoking status, who were known to have an EGFR-activating mutation. All eligible patients had an 
ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2. Key exclusion criteria were mixed histology lung cancer, advanced NSCLC that was known 
to be EGFR wild-type, and untreated brain or meningeal metastases. 
  Baseline characteristics 
A total of 89 patients (30 patients in the 30-mg starting dose group and 59 patients in the 45-mg starting dose 
group) were enrolled in Cohort A, and all were treated with dacomitinib. The majority of patients were female 
(67.4%), <65 years of age (57.3%), Asian (55.1%), and were non-smokers (78.7%). Of the 89 enrolled 
patients, 45 (50.6%) patients had tumours with EGFR-activating mutations confirmed by genetic testing (16 
patients in the 30-mg starting dose group and 29 patients in the 45-mg starting dose group). 25 subjects 
(28.1%) had a del 19 mutation and 20 subjects (22.5%) had an L858R point mutation in exon 21. Most of the

45 patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations had Stage IV NSCLC (37 patients; 82.2%), and the 
remaining patients (8 patients; 17.8%) had Stage IIIB NSCLC at the time of study entry. 
Previous adjuvant chemotherapy for earlier stages of NSCLC was allowed if completed >12 months prior to 
enrolment. Eight (8) of the 89 patients (9.0%) in the ITT population had prior systemic therapy; all 8 had 
chemotherapy as part of the initial treatment of their primary stage of NSCLC. Compared with Study 1050, more 
patients in Study 1017 Cohort A had undergone surgery (57.3%) or radiation treatment (25.8%) for NSCLC. 
 
Efficacy data 
Overall, the median duration of treatment was 40.1 weeks (range: 1.9 to 164.0 weeks). The median number of 
cycles started by patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations was 18 (range 2 to 74).  
PFS 
The primary objective of this study was met by demonstrating that the PFS4m was 76.8% (95% CI: 66.4, 84.4) 
in the ITT population, with a 1-sided p-value<0.0001 for the testing of the null hypothesis (H0): PFS4m ≤50%. 
In the ITT population, the median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI: 9.0, 12.9).  
PFS events per investigator assessment were observed in 36 (80.0%) of the 45 patients with EGFR-activating 
mutations; 34 patients (75.6%) had objective progression, and 2 patients (4.4%) died without objective 
progression. The estimated median PFS was 18.2 months (95% CI: 12.8, 23.8) and PFS at 12 months was 
73.4% (95% CI: 57.1, 84.4). 
OS 
Of the 45 patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations in key supportive Study 1017 Cohort A, 30 
patients (66.7%) had died by the study completion date for the sCSR (30 April 2015). The median OS was 42.3 
months (95% CI: 29.0, 46.6) and the probability of survival at 12 months was 95.6% (95% CI: 83.4%, 98.9%).

Study A7471009 
Multinational, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study of dacomitinib versus erlotinib in 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had previously received 1 or 2 chemotherapy regimens. 
The study evaluated 2 patient populations: (1) all patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of the presence of 
an EGFR-activating mutation and (2) patients with confirmed Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog 
(KRAS) wild-type NSCLC. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that dacomitinib treatment was superior to erlotinib 
treatment with respect to PFS in either of the co-primary populations.  
This study included patients with advanced NSCLC for which there was no curative standard therapy in the 
judgment of the investigator after treatment with at least 1, and no more than 2, regimens of systemic therapy, 
including at least 1 standard chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC. All eligible patients had an ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 
2. Key exclusion criteria were prior therapy with an agent known or proposed to be active by action on EGFR 
tyrosine kinase or other HER family proteins, and untreated brain or meningeal metastases. 
A total of 878 patients (439 in each treatment arm) were randomised to study treatment; 436 patients (99.3%) 
in each arm were treated. The majority of patients were male (64.4%), <65 years of age (55.8%), and White 
(75.9%). Of these, 76 (8.7%) patients had tumours with EGFR-activating mutations (37 in the dacomitinib arm 
and 39 in the erlotinib arm). 
The primary analysis of PFS per IRC review did not show that dacomitinib was superior to erlotinib treatment in 
either of the co-primary populations. In the ITT population the HR was 0.933 (95% CI: 0.797, 1.093). The 
estimated median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.9, 2.8) in the dacomitinib arm and 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.9, 
2.8) in the erlotinib arm.  
Results for the subgroup of 76 randomized patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations (37 patients in 
the dacomitinib arm and 39 patients in the erlotinib arm) are presented in tables 26, 27 and 28. 
Study A7471028 
Multinational, multicenter, randomised, open-label, Phase 2 clinical study of dacomitinib versus erlotinib in 
patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of the presence of EGFR-activating mutations and had disease 
progression following at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. 
This study enrolled male or female patients ≥18 years of age with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC 
and evidence of progressive disease after at least 1, but no more than 2, prior chemotherapy regimens for 
advanced disease and with an ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2. Key exclusion criteria were evidence of small cell or 
carcinoid lung cancer, and untreated brain or meningeal metastases. 
A total of 188 patients were randomised, 94 in each treatment arm (ITT population). The majority of patients 
were male (59.0%), <65 years of age (67.0%), and White (71.8%). Of these, 25 (13.3%) were patients with 
NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations (16 dacomitinib; 9 erlotinib). 
The primary analysis of PFS, as assessed by the investigator, showed a statistically significant improvement in 
PFS for dacomitinib compared with erlotinib in the ITT population. The PFS HR for dacomitinib versus erlotinib 
was 0.657 (95% CI: 0.472, 0.914) with 2-sided p-value=0.012. The estimated median PFS was 2.9 months 
(95% CI: 1.7, 3.7) in the dacomitinib arm and 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.8, 2.7) in the erlotinib arm. 
Results for the subgroup of 25 patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations (16 patients in the 
dacomitinib arm and 9 patients in the erlotinib arm) are presented in tables 26, 27 and 28.

Study A7471011 
Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study of dacomitinib versus placebo in 
patients with incurable Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC regardless of the presence of EGFR-activating mutations after 
standard therapy failure for advanced or metastatic disease. 
This study enrolled male and female patients ≥18 years of age with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of 
NSCLC after failure of up to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and at least 1 therapy with erlotinib or gefitinib. All 
eligible patients had an ECOG PS of 0, 1, 2, or 3. Patients with untreated brain or meningeal metastases were 
excluded from enrollment. 
A total of 720 patients (480 in the dacomitinib arm; 240 in the placebo arm) were randomised to study 
treatment; 477 patients (99.4%) in the dacomitinib arm and 239 patients (99.6%) in the placebo arm were 
treated. Approximately half of the patients were male (50.6%) and approximately half were <65 years of age 
(51.8%); the majority of the patients were White (60.0%) and were past or present smokers (61.9%). 3.5% of 
the patients in the dacomitinib arm and 6.7% of patients in the placebo arm had ECOG PS of 3. Of the 720 
randomized patients, 135 (18.8%) were patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations (83 in the 
dacomitinib arm; 52 in the placebo arm). 
The analysis of the primary OS endpoint in the ITT population did not show that dacomitinib was superior to 
placebo. The HR for dacomitinib versus placebo was 1.003 (95% CI: 0.829, 1.214) with a 1-sided 
p-value=0.510 based on the stratified analysis. The estimated median OS was 6.8 months (95% CI: 6.1, 7.5) 
for dacomitinib and 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.3, 7.5) for placebo. 
Results for the subgroup of 135 randomized patients with EGFR-activating mutations (83 patients in the

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is mainly based on data from 452 patients included in the pivotal study A1050, a phase III, 
multinational, multicentre, open-label, randomised study comparing the efficacy and safety of dacomitinib 
versus gefitinib as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 
EGFR-activating mutations in either exon 19 or exon 21. 
Additionally, supportive data on 45 patients from Cohort A of study A1017 a multinational, multicentre, 
single-arm, phase 2 study were included. Cohort A included patients with untreated locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. 
The applicant has also provided data on other 3 studies of dacomitinib in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC in later lines of therapy: two phase III, double-blind, randomised studies (Study A1009, 
erlotinib-controlled and Study A1011, placebo-controlled) and an open label, randomized phase II study (Study 
A1028, erlotinib-controlled).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A double-blind study design for the pivotal trial (A1050) would have been preferable to an open-label design. 
The main reason for an unblinded design was the different dose reduction strategies used for dacomitinib and 
gefitinib in instances of AE’s requiring dose adjustments. In view of the open-label design, measures were 
implemented in the protocol to minimise bias in the assessment of the primary endpoint (PFS).The overall study 
design of the pivotal study is considered adequate and in line with current European guidelines. Scientific advice 
on the proposed study design was sought from the CHMP in 2012 (EMEA/H/SA/1714/2/2014/II). 
In study A1050, the presence of the EGFR mutations was determined by a local laboratory (except in China, 
where it was determined by the central laboratory) and confirmed by the central laboratory.  
Tumours with EGFR-activating mutations have been associated with a higher sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, being 
exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation the most common EGFR mutations, accounting for approximately 85-90% 
of EGFR mutations. In the pivotal clinical trial only patients with Exon19del or L858R mutation were included. 
However, a broad indication is proposed by the applicant to include mutations other than Exon19del or L858R. 
Nevertheless, efficacy data of dacomitinib against other less common mutations are very limited (only 3 patients 
from Cohort A of study A1017). It is not expected that dacomitinib would have a lower efficacy in other 
mutations. Alternatives authorised in the treatment of EGFR activating mutations do not have a restricted use 
based on specific EGFR mutations despite very little or no clinical data in rare mutations.  
Patients had to be treatment-naïve to systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Although they 
could have received adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy in earlier stages, at least a 12-months disease 
free-interval was required between completion of prior therapy and recurrence of NSCLC.  
Patients with brain or leptomeningeal metastases were excluded, even if the metastases were stable. 
Nevertheless, considering the potential activity of dacomitinib on CNS metastases, data on the use of 
dacomitinib in this population would have been of special interest and should be considered in future clinical 
trials. 
Exclusion of patients with poor performance status (ECOG ≥ 2) could be a limitation of the study; however it is 
not unusual in oncology trials.  
Dacomitinib was administered at a dose of 45 mg once-daily, determined as the maximum tolerated dose in 
study A1001. Gefitinib was administered according to its authorised SmPC, 250 mg once a day. Crossover of 
patients from one treatment arm to the other after disease progression was not allowed. 
The comparator is considered acceptable since gefitinib constitutes one of the standards of care treatments for 
NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations in the first-line setting. Erlotinib, afatinib and the recently approved 
osimertinib, represent suitable treatment options in this setting in the EU. 
Erlotinib is a reversible EGFR TKI authorised in the first-line setting based on the results of the EURTAC study in 
which  superiority over platinum based chemotherapy was demonstrated in terms of PFS and ORR while no 
statistically significant differences in terms of OS were reported. No major differences in efficacy are expected 
between gefitinib and erlotinib in the first-line setting. Neither between both of them and the second generation 
irreversible EGFR TKI, afatinib, which was not widely available at the time the A1050 study initiation. A recent 
meta-analysis (Batson et al. 2017) concluded that there is no difference in efficacy among afatinib, erlotinib, and 
gefitinib. Osimertinib, the newest EGFR TKI (third generation) has recently been approved in Europe for the first 
line treatment of patients with NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations based on the results of the phase III study 
FLAURA (Sora et al. 2018) in which osimertinib was proven superior to the SoC (erlotinib and gefitinib) in terms

of PFS. Importantly, patients with CNS metastases whose condition was neurologically stable were included in 
the trial. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study A1050 was PFS as determined by blinded IRC review according to RECIST 
v1.1. The secondary endpoints were OS, ORR and DoR by IRC and by investigator assessment according to 
RECIST v1.1, TTF, PFS based on investigator assessment and PRO. Demonstration of superiority over gefitinib 
in terms of PFS is considered adequate and sufficient from a regulatory point of view, however this does not 
exempt from the need of assessing how the introduction of dacomitinib could impact next-line therapies and the 
impact on long-term outcome of the disease. No PFS2 data is available although it would have been of special 
interest in this first line setting. Hence, OS as secondary endpoint could provide information on the effect of 
dacomitinib use over subsequent lines of therapy. The rest of secondary endpoints are considered acceptable 
and are supportive. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, baseline and demographic characteristics were well-balanced between arms. The median age at study 
entry was 62 years (range: 28 – 87 years) with only 49 (10.8%) patients aged ≥75 years. Most of the patients 
were female, with a higher proportion of female patients in the dacomitinib arm (64.3% dacomitinib vs. 55.6% 
gefitinib) and had never smoked (64.4%). The majority of patients were Asian (76.5%), which could be 
expected considering that EGFR mutations are most frequent in Asian population. As this could be a limitation for 
an application in the EU,  the applicant has provided a supplemental evaluation of the benefit-risk profile of 
dacomitinib in non-Asian patients. All the included patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, with a higher proportion 
of patients with ECOG 1 in the gefitinib arm (67.0% dacomitinib vs. 72.4% gefitinib).  
Regarding disease characteristics, all patients had NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology and the vast majority of 
them were metastatic (81%). Patients with brain or leptomeningeal metastasis were not allowed, however 5 
patients (1 in the dacomitinib arm and 4 in the gefitinib arm) with brain lesions entered the study.  
At randomisation 134 (59%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 133 (59.1%) patients in the gefitinib arm had 
a deletion in exon 19 whereas 93 (41%) patients and 92 (40.9%) patients in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arm, 
respectively, had L858R mutation in exon 21. Mutations determined at the randomisation required confirmation 
by the central laboratory. Determination of EGFR mutations by central laboratory using the FDA-approved 
Qiagen therascreen EGFR test classified 81 (35.7%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 89 (39.6%) patients in 
the gefitinib arm as having deletion in exon 19 vs. 62 (27.3%) and 57 (25.3%) patients, dacomitinib and 
gefitinib, respectively, as having a mutation in exon 21. The EGFR status was “unknown” in 84 patients in the 
dacomitinib arm and 79 patients in the gefitinib arm due to insufficient tissue for analysis. The overall percent of 
agreement between local and central test was 96.5%. Despite patients with T790 mutations were allowed to 
enter the trial, only 4 patients were determined to have such resistance mutation which is consistent with the 
low prevalence expected for first-line patients. 
Per protocol, all randomised patients were to be treatment-naïve for their advanced NSCLC. Nevertheless, two 
patients (one patient in each treatment arm) had received prior systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC (1 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimen), which is an important protocol deviation, although it is unlikely that it 
could have any effect on the results of the study. 
Six  amendments  to  protocol  were  carried  out.  They  were  mainly  related  to  modifications  of  the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, possibility of continuing therapy after PD and statistical issues (IA). The introduced 
changes are not considered critical for the outcome of the trial.

Study A1050 met its primary objective, showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement 
in terms of PFS as determined by the IRC according to RECIST v1.1, with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib (HR 
0.589 [95% CI: 0.469, 0.739]; 1-sided p-value: < 0.0001). At the time of the data cut-off (29 July 2016), the 
number of events was 59.9% in the dacomitinib arm vs. 79.6% in the gefitinib arm, thus data could be 
considered mature enough.  
The estimated median PFS was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.1, 16.6) in the dacomitinib arm and 9.2 months (95% 
CI: 9.1, 11.0) in the gefitinib arm. The K-M curves overlapped in the first six months and separated afterwards.   
The probability of being PFS event free at 1 year of treatment was also higher in the dacomitinib arm than in the 
gefitinib arm (55.7% vs. 35.9%) and so it was at 2 years (30.6% vs. 9.6%). 
Results of the primary analysis are supported by a number of sensitivity analyses. Results in PFS as assessed by 
the investigator were consistent with the primary analysis with a HR of 0.622 (95% CI: 0.497, 0.779). The 
median PFS was 16.6 months in the dacomitinib arm and 11.0 months in the gefitinib arm. Overall differential 
disagreement rate was -10.2% (44.9% for dacomitinib vs. 55.1% for gefitinib).  
While a longer PFS was seen with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib, no statistically significant differences were 
reported in terms of ORR between treatment arms. Only a numerical trend was observed with an ORR of 74.9% 
in the dacomitinib arm and 71.6% in the gefitinib arm. However, DoR was longer in patients treated with 
dacomitinib, with a median DoR of 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.0, 17.4) compared to 8.3 months (95% CI: 7.4, 
9.2) in the gefitinib arm. 
The higher inhibitory potency of dacomitinib compared to gefitinib as well as the longer inhibition due to its 
irreversible action, are potential causes justifying the longer PFS reached with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib. 
In addition, dacomitinib inhibitory activity against HER2 could have also contributed, since HER2 gene 
amplification has been reported as a potential mechanism of resistance following treatment with EGFR signal 
blocking agents, such as gefitinib or erlotinib (Planchard et al 2018). The mechanisms of resistance to 
dacomitinib have not been discussed. 
OS results from the final analysis (17- Feb-2017) when 48.7% of events had occurred showed a HR of 0.760 (95% 
CI: 0.582, 0.993; p=0.0219) and a gain of 7.3 months in OS in the dacomitinib arm. However, according to the 
hierarchical approach, the analysis was stopped with the testing of ORR as the statistical significance was not 
reached. Therefore, a statistical benefit in OS could not be formally assessed.  
Focusing on the analysis of subgroups for PFS based on IRC assessment, results were in general consistent with 
the whole population in most of the analysed subgroups (including subsets according to EGFR mutations) except 
for patients ≥ 75 years. The apparently lower efficacy in the subgroup of very elderly patients (≥75 years) could 
be driven by the lower sample size of this subgroup that leads to wide 95% CIs.  
In the study A1050 the majority of patients were Asian (76.5%), while Non-Asian patients represented only 23.5% 
of the population. For this reason, the applicant has provided a supplemental analysis of the benefit/risk profile 
of dacomitinib in non-Asian patients (105 White patients + 1 Black patient).  
Although race was a stratification factor, analysis of Asian vs. non-Asian population may be limited by the 
sample size of the latter. Analysis of PFS points towards lower benefit for the subgroup of non-Asian patients (HR: 
0.889, 95%CI: 0.568, 1.391) compared to Asian patients (HR: 0.509, 95%CI: 0.391, 0.662), suggesting that 
the observed effect in the overall population may be driven by the subset of Asian patients. The percentage of 
PFS events is pretty similar or even higher in the Non-Asian patients (68%-80%) as compared to ITT population 
(60%-80%), which would reject the immaturity as a potential explanation for the differences in the non-Asian 
group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 98/144 
  
  
Moreover, the submitted literature review indicates that there is no consistent pattern that would suggest that 
non-Asian patients respond differently from Asian patients to this class of drug (Lee and Wu 2015). 
Further, the provided PK/PD data do not suggest a biological distinction between Asians and non-Asians that 
could explain the observed difference in the estimated treatment effect between these subgroups.  
Few patients died during the first 12 months and it is not possible to conclude that the differences in deaths per 
month were due to either lack of efficacy, toxicity related to treatment or patient characteristics. The early 
crossing in survival curves observed in Study 1050 could be due to random chance. The applicant has as part of 
the pre-specified analysis examined and found the proportional hazards assumption to hold. 
PRO questionnaires were completed by more than 90% of patients for almost all cycles. Regarding PROs in the 
overall population, no differences were observed in time to deterioration between treatment arms. 
Improvements in most of the symptoms were reported in both treatment arms. In the dacomitinib arm, there 
was no statistically significant change from baseline observed for overall global QoL. In the gefitinib arm, a 
statistically significant improvement was seen in change from baselines scores (p<0.0001), but did not reach 
the 10-point threshold of being clinically meaningful. A statistically significant difference in global quality of life 
was observed between the two treatment groups, favouring gefitinib (P=0.0002). In any case, PRO are 
considered of limited value considering the open label design of the clinical trial. 
Supportive studies 
The phase 2 Study 1017 Cohort A included first-line NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations, thus a can 
be consider a population comparable to that of the pivotal trial. A median PFS of 18.2 months (95% CI: 12.8, 
23.8) was observed for patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations which is supportive of findings from 
the pivotal trial. 
Positive trends in PFS were observed in the other supportive studies in the subgroup of patients with 
EGFR-activating mutations. However, the sample size and the exploratory nature of these subgroup analyses do 
not allow to draw firm conclusions, even though all of them are pointing out in the same direction, favouring the 
dacomitinib arm. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In this MAA Dacomitinib was proven to significantly prolong PFS when compared to gefitinib (gain 5.5 months in 
median estimate) in the population of NSCLC patients with activating mutations as compared to SOC gefitinib.  
The efficacy of dacomitinib in the applied indication is considered sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The dacomitinib clinical development program consists of a total of 26 clinical studies. As of the data cut-off date 
of 29 July 2016, a total of 3141 patients with solid malignant tumours, including non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), have received dacomitinib or a comparator.  
Safety analyses are presented for populations comprising patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and whose data were analyzed in accordance with the study drug received.  
To obtain a broader perspective of the safety profile of dacomitinib, safety data were pooled across studies for 
dacomitinib-treated patients in the following populations:

  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Pool (All Tumours Pool): all patients with solid tumours who received at 
least 1 dose of single-agent dacomitinib independent of dose, line of therapy, or the presence or 
absence of EGFR-activating mutations (1975 treated patients in 14 completed studies). 
 
Pool B (All NSCLC Pool): previously treated or first-line patients with NSCLC who received single-agent 
dacomitinib at a starting dose of 45 mg QD in the presence or absence of EGFR-activating mutations 
(1473 treated patients in 10 completed studies).

Adverse Drug Reactions 
ADRs were identified based on whether an AE was reasonably associated with dacomitinib treatment in the 
First-Line Pool (Study 1050 and Cohort A of study 2017); taking into consideration the mechanism of action of 
dacomitinib, temporal relationship, underlying disease and concomitant medication confounders, the available 
nonclinical toxicity data, and the overall assessment of AEs by the investigators. Some ADRs are denoted as 
clusters of MedDRA PTs in order to minimize ADR frequency underestimation.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Given that the frequency of the AEoSIs may have been underestimated by reliance on a single MedDRA PT, 
selected PTs were analyzed in aggregate using cluster terms denoted in ALL CAPITALS. 
Table 57: Overview of All-Causality and treatment-related AEoSIs , by Cluster Term, in Study 
A7471050  
Gastrointestinal events 
-  DIARRHOEA AND ASSOCIATED AEs: The incidence of all-causality DIARRHOEA AND ASSOCIATED AEs per 
1000 person-years in the dacomitinib arm was statistically significantly higher than that in the gefitinib arm 
(p<0.0001). At least 1 SAE was reported for 2.6% of patients in the dacomitinib arm, while no SAEs were 
reported in the gefitinib arm. One Grade 5 AE was reported in the dacomitinib arm. Permanent 
discontinuations from treatment associated with DIARRHOEA AND ASSOCIATED AEs were reported in the 
dacomitinib arm only (2 [0.9%] patients). Most events reported in either treatment arm were considered to 
be related to treatment. Excluding Disease progression, Diarrhoea was the next most frequently reported 
SAE (5 [2.2%] patients) in the dacomitinib arm of Study 1050. In the dacomitinib arm, the median time to 
first onset of any severity grade DIARRHOEA AND ASSOCIATED AEs was 7.0 days, while the median time to 
onset of maximum grade event was 14.0 days; both shorter times than those in the gefitinib arm (17.0 days 
and 18.5 days, respectively). The median total duration of any grade Diarrhoea throughout the treatment 
period by patient was approximately twice as long in the dacomitinib arm (109.5 days) than in the gefitinib 
arm (50.0 days). The median total duration by patient of Grade 3 Diarrhoea was also twice as long in the 
dacomitinib arm (5.0 days) than in the gefitinib arm (2.5 days); no Grade 4 Diarrhoea was reported in either 
treatment arm. 
-  GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATION: AEs within this cluster were reported for 1 patient in each treatment 
arm. Neither AE was serious, considered to be related to study treatment, or required treatment 
modification. 
-  STOMATITIS: The incidence per 1000 person-years in the dacomitinib arm was statistically significantly 
higher than that in the gefitinib arm (p<0.0001). An SAE was reported for 1 (0.4%) patient in the dacomitinib

arm, while no SAEs were reported in the gefitinib arm. No Grade 5 STOMATITS was reported in either 
treatment arm. Permanent treatment discontinuations associated with STOMATITIS were reported in the 
dacomitinib arm only (2 [0.9%] patients). Dose reductions or temporary treatment discontinuations 
associated with STOMATITIS were reported in the dacomitinib arm only (4.4% of patients and 8.4%, 
respectively). Most events reported in both treatment arms were considered to be related to treatment. In 
the dacomitinib arm, the median time to first onset of any severity grade STOMATITIS was 8.0 days, while 
the median time to onset of maximum grade event was 11.0 days; the shorter times to first onset than those 
reported in the gefitinib arm (18.5 days and 20.0 days, respectively).

Skin and other dermal conditions 
-  SEVERE SKIN TOXICITY: the frequencies were balanced across treatment arms (3.5% dacomitinib, 3.6% 
gefitinib). All AEs were considered to be related to treatment. No Grade 5 AEs, SAEs, or treatment 
modifications were reported in either treatment arm. 
-  RASH/DERMATITIS ACNEIFORM: The incidence per 1000 person-years in the dacomitinib arm was 
statistically significantly higher than that in the gefitinib arm (p<0.0001). No Grade 5 AE was reported in 
either treatment arm. In the dacomitinib arm, at least 1 SAE was reported for 3 (1.3%) patients, while no 
SAEs were reported in the gefitinib arm. Permanent discontinuations from treatment were reported for 6 
(2.6%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and no patients in the gefitinib arm. Dose reductions or temporary 
treatment discontinuations were reported for the higher proportions of patients in the dacomitinib arm (32.2% 
or 25.6% of patients, respectively) than in the gefitinib arm (1.3% or 2.7%). Most events reported in either 
treatment arm were considered to be related to treatment. In the dacomitinib arm, the median time to first 
onset of any severity grade RASH/DERMATITIS ACNEIFORM was 13.0 days, comparable to that in the 
gefitinib arm (16.0 days). However, the median time to first onset of maximum severity grade 
RASH/DERMATITIS ACNEIFORM was more than 2-fold longer in the dacomitinib arm (56.5 days) than in the 
gefitinib arm (26.5 days). 
-  OTHER SKIN TOXICITY: The incidence per 1000 person-years in the dacomitinib arm was statistically 
significantly higher than that in the gefitinib arm (p<0.0001). No Grade 5 AEs, SAEs, or permanent treatment 
discontinuations associated with OTHER SKIN TOXICITY were reported in either treatment arm. Dose 
reductions or temporary treatment discontinuations were reported in the higher proportions of patients in the 
dacomitinib arm (20.7% and 14.1% of patients, respectively) than in the gefitinib arm (0.9% each). Most 
events were considered to be related to treatment in either treatment arm. Most AEs within were Grade 1 or 
Grade 2 in severity. The frequency of Grade 3 Paronychia was meaningfully higher in the dacomitinib arm.

Renal events 
-  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: At least 1 AE of ACUTE RENAL FAILURE was reported for comparable proportions of 
patients in the dacomitinib arm (4.8%) and the gefitinib arm (5.8%) of Study 1050. No Grade 5 AEs or 
permanent treatment discontinuations were reported. Most AEs in the dacomitinib arm and more than half of 
AEs in the gefitinib arm were considered to be related to treatment. Most AEs reported in the dacomitinib arm 
al all AEs in the gefitinib arm were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. In the dacomitinib arm, Grade 3 Anuria and 
Grade 4 Acute kidney injury were reported for 1 (0.4%) patient each. Overall, the AE frequencies reported in 
the dacomitinib arm were comparable with those reported in the gefitinib arm. 
-  CREATININE ABNORMAL LABORATORY FINDINGS: Most patients in both treatment arms of Study 1050 had 
Grade 1-2 increased Creatinine postbaseline.  The only shift in creatinine values from Grade ≤2 at baseline 
was reported in the gefitinib arm to Grade 3 postbaseline. 
Interstitial lung disease 
At least 1 AE of INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE was reported for 6 (2.6%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 3 
(1.3%) patients in the gefitinib arm, while at least 1 SAE was reported for 3 (1.3%) patients in the dacomitinib 
arm and 2 (0.9%) patients in the gefitinib arm of Study 1050. A Grade 5 event was reported for 1 (0.4%) patient 
in the dacomitinib arm, and none in the gefitinib arm. Permanent treatment discontinuations were reported for 
4 (1.8%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 3 (1.3%) patients in the gefitinib arm, while temporary treatment 
discontinuations were reported for 2 (0.9%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and none in the gefitinib arm. All 
but 1 event in the dacomitinib arm and all AEs in the gefitinib arm were considered to be related to treatment. 
Only 2 unique AEs, Interstitial lung disease and Pneumonitis, were reported in both the dacomitinib arm (3 
[1.3%] patients each) and gefitinib arm (1 [0.4%] and 2 [0.9%] patients, respectively) of Study 1050. Grade 3 
and Grade 5 AEs of Pneumonitis (1 [0.4%] patient each) were reported in the dacomitinib arm, while Grade 3 
Pneumonitis was reported for 1 (0.4%) patient in the gefitinib arm of this study.

The median time to the first episode of any grade ILD/pneumonitis was 16 weeks and the median time to the 
worst episode of ILD/pneumonitis was 16 weeks in patients receiving dacomitinib. The median duration of any 
grade and Grade ≥ 3 ILD/pneumonitis was 13 weeks and 1.5 weeks, respectively (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Hepatic events 
-  Hepatotoxicity: At least 1 AE was reported for 4 (1.8%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 8 (3.6%) 
patients in the gefitinib arm of Study 1050, while at least 1 SAE was reported for 3 (1.3%) patients in the 
dacomitinib arm and 2 (0.9%) patients in the gefitinib arm. No Grade 5 AE was reported in either treatment 
arm. Permanent or temporary treatment discontinuations or dose reductions were reported infrequently. All 
but 1 AEs in each treatment arm were considered to be related to treatment. Grade 3 AEs of Drug-induced 
liver injury, Liver injury, and Ascites were reported in the dacomitinib arm of Study 1050 for 1 (0.4%) patient 
each. In the gefitinib arm, the reported Grade 3 AEs were Liver injury (3 [1.3%] patients), Drug-induced liver 
injury (1 [0.4%]), and Hepatic failure (1 [0.4%]). No Grade 4 or Grade 5 AEs were reported in either 
treatment arm. 
-  Liver-related laboratory adverse events: Most AEs reported were Grade 1-2 in severity.  The incidence of 
all-causality liver-related laboratory test AEs per 1000 person-years in the gefitinib arm was statistically 
significantly higher than that in the dacomitinib arm (p=0.0001). In the dacomitinib arm no Grade 5 AEs, 
SAEs, or permanent treatment discontinuations were reported. Dose reductions or temporary treatment 
discontinuations were reported for 1 (0.4%) and 2 (0.9%) patients, respectively, in the dacomitinib arm. 
Most liver-related laboratory test AEs were considered to be related to treatment in either treatment arm. 
The median time to the first episode of any grade of transaminases increased was approximately 12 weeks 
and the median time to the worst episode of transaminases increased was 12 weeks in patients receiving 
dacomitinib. The median duration of any grade and Grade ≥ 3 transaminases increased was 11 weeks and 1 
week, respectively.

Keratitis 
Keratitis was reported for 4 (1.8%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and no patients in the gefitinib arm. An SAE, 
permanent or temporary treatment discontinuation associated with keratitis, and dose reduction associated with 
keratitis were reported for 1 (0.4%) patient each in the dacomitinib arm. All reported events were considered to 
be related to treatment. One AE of Keratitis was Grade 3 in severity, while none were Grade 4 in severity. 
Cardiovascular events 
-  QT interval prolongation: AEs were reported for 3 (1.3%) patients in the dacomitinib arm. The AEs reported 
were Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, Long QT syndrome, and Syncope, for 1 (0.4%) patient each. Only the 
case of long QT syndrome was considered to be related to dacomitinib treatment. No Grade 5 AE, SAEs, 
permanent or temporary treatment discontinuations or dose reductions were reported. Four (1.9%) patients 
had a 60 msec increase in QTcF from baseline, while none had postbaseline QTcF of 500 msec. 
Regarding data on Pool B, the proportion of patients who had events within the QT interval prolongation 
cluster was in line with study A1050 (19 [1.3%]). Most of the events were among the PTs of syncope (6 
[0.6%]), cardiac arrest (2 [0.1%]) and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (2 [0.1%]). There were 3 (0.2%) 
fatal events (2 cardiac arrests and 1 sudden death). Additionally, 1 patient in study 1042 reported an AE of 
cardiac arrest. None of the events were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. Sudden 
death was of unknown cause and as a precautionary measure was considered to be related to dacomitinib by 
the applicant.  
No events of Torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular flutter have been reported with 
dacomitinib. One (0.2%) patient had a maximum postbaseline QTcF≥ 500 msec (study A1011) and 10 
(2.8%) patients had maximum QTcF increased from baseline of ≥60 msec (4 in the dacomitinib arm of study 
A1050). No cardiac AEs were reported for these patients.  
-  Left ventricular function (LVEF): AEs were reported for 2 (0.9%) patients in the dacomitinib arm and 1 (0.4%) 
patient in the gefitinib arm. No Grade 5 AEs, SAEs, or permanent treatment discontinuations were reported. 
A dose reduction was reported for 1 patient in the dacomitinib arm, while a temporary treatment 
discontinuation was reported for 1 patient in the gefitinib arm. None of the events reported in the dacomitinib 
arm were considered to be related to treatment. In the dacomitinib arm of Study 1050, 2 AEs within the 
cluster were reported: Grade 4 Cardiopulmonary failure and Grade 1 Ejection fraction decreased (1 [0.4%] 
patient each). Grade 2 Ejection fraction decreased (1 [0.4%] patient) was the only AE reported in the 
gefitinib arm of the study. 
In the Pool B the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction was also low (12 [0.8%]) and the majority of events 
were grade 1 or 2. There was one fatal event (pulmonary oedema) but it was not considered to be related to 
dacomitinib. The proportion of patients with a maximum relative decrease from baseline in LVEF > 20% in 
the First Line Pool (n=255) was 3.2% and only 2 (0.9%) patients with normal baseline LVEF (≥ 55%) had a 
postbaseline LVEF < 55%. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No cases within the REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY were retrieved considered to be relevant 
in Study 1050 or supporting studies 1009, 1011 and 1028.

and 40.1%) were the more frequently observed abnormal postbaseline haematology laboratory test findings. 
Most abnormal postbaseline haematology findings were Grade 1-2 in severity in either treatment arm. The most 
common Grade 3 postbaseline haematology test findings were lymphopenia (6.5% in the dacomitinib arm, and 
3.0% in the gefitinib arm) and anaemia (0.9% and 2.7%). Lymphopenia was the only Grade 4 finding reported 
in the dacomitinib arm (1 [0.5%] patient). No Grade 4 haematology test findings were reported in the gefitinib 
arm. 
In the dacomitinib arm, the most frequently reported shift (frequency 1% of patients) from Grade 2 at 
baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline was in lymphopenia (5.3% of patients). In the gefitinib arm, the most 
frequently reported shifts (frequency 1% of patients) from Grade 2 at baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline were 
in lymphopenia and anaemia (2.7% of patients each).

In the non-Asian subgroup of the dacomitinib arm, Grade 5 AEs were reported for 9 (15.8%) patients and the 
most frequently reported Grade 5 AE (frequency ≥3.0% of patients) was Disease progression (4 [7%]). In the 
non-Asian subgroup of the dacomitinib arm, Grade 5 AEs were reported for 9 (15.8%) patients and the most 
frequently reported Grade 5 AE was Disease progression (4 [7%]). The frequency of Grade 5 TRAEs was low and 
comparable between the non-Asian and Asian subgroups.

o  Adverse Events of Special Interest

o  Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Results in the non-Asian and Asian subgroups were consistent with the results in the As-Treated population with 
anemia as the most frequently reported of the most abnormal postbaseline hematology findings in both the 
dacomitinib and gefitinib arm and most findings Grade 1 or 2 in severity. In the dacomitinib arm of the 
As-Treated population, the most frequently reported shift (≥1.0% of patients) from Grade ≤2 at baseline to 
Grade 3 postbaseline was lymphopenia (13.4% in non-Asian and 2.9% in Asian subgroup). 
In the dacomitinib arm, lower frequencies of increased creatinine, hyperglycemia, and hypoalbumenia were 
observed in the non-Asian subgroup compared to the Asian subgroup. In the gefitinib arm, lower frequencies of 
increased AST and increased total bilirubin were observed in the non-Asian subgroup. 
In the dacomitinib arm of the As-Treated population, the most frequently reported shifts from Grade ≤2 at 
baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline (≥2.0% of patients) were observed for hypokalemia (5.7% of patients), 
hypermagnesemia (3.1%), and hyponatremia (2.2%). Shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 4 postbaseline 
were observed for no more than 2 (0.9%) patients in the dacomitinib arm. In the gefitinib arm, the most 
frequently reported shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline were in ALT (11.6% of patients), 
AST (6.7%), hypermagnesemia (2.7%), hyperglycemia (2.2%), and hypokalemia (2.2%). Shifts from Grade ≤2 
at baseline to Grade 4 postbaseline were observed for no more than 2 (0.9%) patients in the gefitinib arm. The 
proportions of patients with shifts in ALT and AST from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline were higher 
in the gefitinib arm (10.3% and 6.7% of patients, respectively) than in the dacomitinib arm (1.3% and 0.4%, 
respectively). Results were generally comparable between the non-Asian and Asian subgroups with regards to 
shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline in either treatment arm.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on the analyses in Study A7471050, extensive use of PPIs by Asian, non-Asian patients and Total Arm 
Patients did not appear to demonstrate relevance to clinical safety or efficacy of dacomitinib in Asian, non-Asian 
or Total Arm Patients in Study A7471050.  In the EGFR-activating mutation subset of Study A7471009 there 
were no patients with extensive PPI use, therefore an analysis of safety and efficacy of PPI use in this 
subpopulation was not performed.  The current recommendation on the PPI use was based on the 
pharmacokinetic results from a formal drug-drug interaction study with a PPI (rabeprazole), where rabeprazole 
(40 mg for 7 days) decreased dacomitinib exposure (AUC 0-96h) by 39%  
This decrease in dacomitinib exposure may reduce the clinical efficacy. Therefore, due to the small sample size 
of the subgroups and the confounding nature of the post-hoc analyses, these results are difficult to interpret and 
not considered sufficiently reliable to support a change in the currently proposed dose recommendation with PPI.

Treatment modifications associated with AEs 
Dose reductions owing to AEs were reported for 26.8%, 55.9%, and 62.4% of patients in Pool B, Pool A, and the 
First-Line Pool, respectively. The most frequently reported AEs associated with a dose reduction (frequency ≥2% 
of patients) were Dermatitis acneiform (6.1%, 15.8%, and 18.4%, respectively), Paronychia (5.5%, 12.9%, 
and 15.3%, respectively), and Diarrhoea (1.9%, 7.7%, and 7.5%, respectively). Dose reductions were reported 
more frequently in the dacomitinib arm of Study 1050 than in the gefitinib arm, and the pattern of AEs reported 
was similar than that of the pooled populations. 
Temporary treatment discontinuations were reported in the pooled populations for 29.9%, 42.6%, and 53.3% 
of patients in Pool B, Pool A, and the First-Line Pool, respectively. The most frequently reported AEs associated 
with temporary treatment discontinuation (frequency ≥3% of patients) were Diarrhoea (11.2%, 9.9%, and 
9.8%, respectively), Dermatitis acneiform (5.0%, 9.0%, and 13.1%, respectively), and Paronychia (3.7%, 
8.9%, and 11.8%, respectively). A summary of AEs associated with temporary treatment discontinuation

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety for dacomitinib has been evaluated in a clinical program including 26 clinical studies. Safety 
data have been pooled across studies to obtain a broader perspective of the safety profile. This assessment 
focused on Phase 3 Pivotal study A7471050 (Study 1050) and Pool B.  Pool B represents 1473 previously treated 
or first-line patients with NSCLC who received single-agent dacomitinib at a starting dose of 45 mg QD 
independent of the presence or absence of EGFR-activating mutations. 
Dacomitinib starting dose was 45 mg once a day, although dose modifications (dose reductions and/or dose 
interruptions) were allowed to manage adverse events.  
The median exposure to dacomitinib in the pivotal study A1050 was 66.7 weeks (range: 0.3-162.7), which was 
longer than the median exposure to gefitinib (52.1 weeks [range: 0.3-148.3]). Median exposure to dacomitinib 
is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, median relative dose intensity (RDI) was 72.5% and only in 67 (29.5%) 
patients RDI was > 90-100%. This is in line with the high rates of dose modifications reported in patients treated 
with dacomitinib. In the dacomitinib arm of study A1050, 66.1% of patients reported at least one dose reduction 
and 78.0% required temporary treatment discontinuation, compared to 8% and 53.6%, respectively, in the 
gefitinib arm. The most common AEs leading to dose reductions or treatment interruptions in patients treated 
with dacomitinib were dermatitis acneiform, paronychia and diarrhoea. Additionally, permanent treatment 
discontinuations associated with AEs were reported for 17.6% of patients in the dacomitinib arm and 12.1% of 
patients in the gefitinib arm. The most frequently reported AEs associated with permanent treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 132/144 
  
  
 
discontinuation in the dacomitinib arm other than disease progression (2.6%), were Pneumonia (2.2%) and 
Dermatitis acneiform (1.3%). 
In Pool B, median treatment duration was 12.0 weeks (RDI: 97.5 %). In the Asian subgroup, longer median 
treatment duration was reported compared to the non-Asian subgroup (77.9 weeks vs. 52.7 weeks). 
Overall, the clinical safety results for patients treated with dacomitinib in Study 1050 were consistent with those 
observed in Pool B.  
The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions in patients receiving dacomitinib were diarrhoea (88.6%), rash 
(79.2%), stomatitis (71.8%), nail disorder (65.5%), dry skin (33.3%), decreased appetite (31.8%), 
conjunctivitis (24.7%), weight decreased (24.3%), alopecia (23.1%), pruritus (22.4%), transaminases 
increased (22.0%), and nausea (20.4%). 
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 6.7% of patients treated with dacomitinib. The most frequently 
(≥ 1%) reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving dacomitinib were diarrhoea (2.0%), interstitial 
lung disease (1.2%), rash (1.2%), and decreased appetite (1.2%). 
Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions were reported in 52.2% of patients treated with dacomitinib. The 
most frequently reported (> 5%) reasons for dose reductions due to any adverse reactions in patients receiving 
dacomitinib were rash (32.2%), nail disorder (16.5%), and diarrhoea (7.5%). 
Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were reported in 6.7% of patients treated with 
dacomitinib. The most common (> 0.5%) reasons for permanent discontinuations associated with adverse 
reactions in patients receiving dacomitinib were rash (2.4%), interstitial lung disease (2.0%), and diarrhoea 
(0.8%). 
Diarrhoea, including severe diarrhoea, has been very commonly reported during treatment with dacomitinib. 
Diarrhoea may result in dehydration with or without renal impairment, which could be fatal if not adequately 
treated.  
Proactive management of diarrhoea should start at the first sign of diarrhoea especially within the first 2 weeks 
of starting dacomitinib, including adequate hydration combined with anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products and 
continued until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours. Anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g., 
loperamide) should be used and, if necessary, escalated to the highest recommended approved dose. Patients 
may require dosing interruption and/or dose reduction of therapy with dacomitinib. Patients should maintain 
adequate oral hydration and patients who become dehydrated may require administration of intravenous fluids 
and electrolytes (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).  
Rash, erythematous and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported in patients treated with Vizimpro. For 
prevention of dry skin, initiate treatment with moisturizers, and upon development of rash, initiate treatment 
with topical antibiotics, emollients, and topical steroids. Start oral antibiotics and topical steroids in patients who 
develop exfoliative skin conditions. Consider adding broad spectrum oral or intravenous antibiotics if any of 
these conditions worsen to greater than or equal to Grade 2 severity. Rash, erythematous and exfoliative skin 
conditions may occur or worsen in areas exposed to the sun. Advise patients to use protective clothing and 
sunscreen before exposure to the sun. Patients may require dosing interruption and/or dose reduction of 
therapy with dacomitinib (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Overall, the incidence of acute renal failure cluster was low in patient treated with dacomitinib across trials. In 
the study A1050 it was reported in 11/227 patients (4.8%). The majority of events were grade 1 or grade 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 133/144 
  
  
Grade 3 events were reported in 1 patient (anuria). Additionally, one patient reported an AE grade 4 of acute 
kidney injury, which was considered secondary to grade 5 AE of diarrhoea.  
In the pooled population 1 patient reported grade 5 renal failure which was not considered by the investigator 
related to study drug. 
Interstitial lung disease( ILD)/pneumonitis, which could be fatal, has been reported in patients receiving 
dacomitinib. Patients with a history of ILD have not been studied. 
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary symptoms (e.g., 
dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD/pneumonitis. Treatment with dacomitinib should 
be withheld pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed, dacomitinib should be 
permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as necessary (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).  
Transaminases increased (alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
transaminases increased) have been reported during treatment with dacomitinib. Among NSCLC patients 
treated with dacomitinib 45 mg daily, there have been isolated reports of hepatotoxicity in 4 (1.6%) patients. 
Across the dacomitinib program, hepatic failure led to a fatal outcome in 1 patient. Therefore, periodic liver 
function testing is recommended. In patients who develop severe elevations in transaminases while taking 
dacomitinib, treatment should be interrupted (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and RMP). 
Prevalence of AEoSIs reported for at least 10% of patients up to Cycle 39 in Pool B was summarized by cycle 
interval. The frequencies of these AEoSIs were highest during Cycles 1 to 6 and then decreased gradually over 
Cycles 7 to 39. 
Overall, the proportion of deaths in study A1050 was lower in the dacomitinib arm than in the gefitinib arm (76 
[33.5%] vs. 91 [40.6%], respectively). The majority of deaths were related to disease under study in both 
treatment arms (68 [30.0%] dacomitinib vs. 85 [37.9%] gefitinib). In the dacomitinib arm 2 (0.9%) deaths 
were related to study treatment toxicity (1 diarrhoea and 1 death of unknown cause in a patient who had 
reported an AE of grade 3 of drug-liver injury). Both deaths occurred prior to or on 28 days after last dose. 
Additionally, there were 4 deaths due to other reasons (bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pneumonia, diazepam 
overdose, and lung infection) and 2 deaths reported as “unknown”. 
Administration of EGFR TKIs have been shown to increase the risk of all-grade infections (Wang et al., 2017). 
However, no association between administration of EGFR TKI and high grade (severe/life threatening) infections 
was made.  
SAEs were more frequent in patients treated with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib (27.3% vs. 22.3%) and 
treatment-related SAEs were twice as common in the dacomitinib arm of Study 1050 than in the gefitinib arm 
(21 [9.3%] vs. 10 [4.5%]). The most frequent treatment-related SAE reported in the dacomitinib arm were 
diarrhoea, (5 [2.2%]), abdominal pain and liver injury (2 [0.9%], each).  
Other common treatment-related SAEs (≥ 1%) reported in dacomitinib clinical trials were dehydration and 
vomiting.  
According to safety data on 157 patients ≥75 years from the NSCLC Pool B, tolerability of dacomitinib appears 
to be worse in this population compared to patients <75 years, according to the higher rates of SAEs, grade 3 
AEs and discontinuations (permanent and temporary) reported in this population of very elderly patients.  
Regarding dacomitinib safety profile by race (Non-Asian vs. Asian), overall incidence of AEs was similar between 
groups, however SAEs, grade 3  and grade 5 AEs as well as permanent and temporary treatment 
discontinuations were more frequent in Non-Asian patients. This difference between groups was less evident in 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 134/144 
  
  
the gefitinib arm of the study. No major differences were observed between Non-Asian and Asian patients in the 
overall incidence of TRAEs, serious TRAEs and treatment discontinuations and modifications. However, 
treatment-related grade 3 AEs were more frequent in Non-Asian patients treated with dacomitinib. These 
differences may be explained by a more elderly non-Asian population. 
Grade 3 AEs and dose reductions were reported more frequently in women. More women than men were 
permanently discontinued from treatment due to AEs in the dacomitinib arm while in the gefitinib arm the 
numbers were similar. 
Based on the analyses in Study A7471050, concomitant PPI use by Asian, non-Asian patients and all patients did 
not show clinically relevant effect on dacomitinib in these subgroups of patients. However, due to the small 
sample size of the subgroups and the confounding nature of the post-hoc analyses, these results are difficult to 
interpret and not considered sufficiently reliable. Based on the pharmacokinetic results from a formal drug-drug 
interaction study with rabeprazole, PPIs should be avoided while receiving treatment with dacomitinib (see 
section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Anaemia and lymphopenia were the most frequently reported abnormal postbaseline haematology findings in 
patients treated with dacomitinib. The majority were grade 1 or grade 2. In the dacomitinib arm, the most 
frequently reported shift (≥1.0% of patients) from Grade ≤ 2 at baseline to Grade 3 postbaseline was also 
lymphopenia. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Vizimpro. 
Women of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product should use adequate contraceptive 
methods during therapy and for at least 17 days (5 half-lives) after completing therapy. There are no data on the 
use of dacomitinib in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, dacomitinib may cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Dacomitinib should not be used during pregnancy. Female patients 
taking dacomitinib during pregnancy or who become pregnant while taking dacomitinib should be apprised of 
the potential hazard to the foetus (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
It is not known whether dacomitinib and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal 
products are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed 
infants from exposure to dacomitinib, mothers should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving this 
medicinal product. 
Dacomitinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing fatigue or ocular 
adverse reactions while taking dacomitinib should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery. 
The adverse reactions observed at doses greater than 45 mg once daily were primarily gastrointestinal, 
dermatological, and constitutional (e.g., fatigue, malaise, and weight loss).  
There is no known antidote for dacomitinib. The treatment of dacomitinib overdose should consist of 
symptomatic treatment and general supportive measures. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of dacomitinib in the proposed indication is in line with the expected safety profile for 
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and generally consistent with that of the irreversible EGFR inhibitor afatinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/201148/2019 
Page 135/144 
  
  
The most commonly reported adverse events related to dacomitinib were gastrointestinal (diarrhoea and 
stomatitis), skin related (dermatitis acneiform, dry skin rash, pruritus), nail-related (paronychia), and 
decreased appetite.  
Other adverse events of special interest reported in clinical trials were acute renal failure, interstitial lung 
disease, keratitis, hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation and left ventricular dysfunction. Reproductive and 
developmental toxicity has been identified as a potential risk in non-clinical trials. 
The toxicity profile of dacomitinib overall seems worse than that of gefitinib, according to the higher rates of 
treatment related AEs, grade 3 TRAEs, treatment related SAEs and discontinuations.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of dacomitinib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers dacomitinib to be a new active substance as it is not a

constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vizimpro (dacomitinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as:  
- 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Dacomitinib is a pan-HER (EGFR/HER1, HER2/erythroblastosis oncogene B [ERBB]2, and HER4/ERBB4) 
inhibitor, with clinical activity against mutated EGFR with del exon 19 or L858R.  
The claimed indication is for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations.  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and the leading cause of cancer related death 
in women in developed countries, and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in less developed 
countries. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of all lung cancers, and the 
majority of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
The developments in molecular testing techniques and targeted therapies have changed the diagnosis and 
treatment paradigms for patients with NSCLC. Research by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium has 
demonstrated that overall survival (OS) is longer for patients who have NSCLC with oncogenic driver mutations 
who were treated with molecularly targeted therapies in their treatment paradigm. The discovery of mutations 
in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cleft within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase 
domain has better defined which patients would derive clinical benefit from the targeted treatment of these 
driver mutations. It also has furthered understanding of the development of resistance to treatment.

EMA/201148/2019 
Page 138/144 
  
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
EGFR-activating mutations occur in about 10% to 20% of White patients and in about 30% to 50% in East Asian 
patients with NSCLC out of the approximately 1.6 million patients worldwide diagnosed with NSCLC annually. 
EGFR-activating mutations are more common in tumours of non-squamous than of squamous histology, in 
women than in men, in Asians than in non-Asians, and in never-smokers than in prior or current smokers. The 
presence of EGFR-activating mutations is less well studied in some populations such as Black/African American, 
Hispanic/Latino, and Pacific Islanders. 
Currently, first-generation (gefitinib and erlotinib) and second-generation (afatinib) EGFR TKIs are approved 
globally for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations. Osimertinib is a 
third-generation EGFR TKI that is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M 
mutation-positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy34, and is approved in the 
EU for the indication of treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation 
positive NSCLC. Recently, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for osimertinib in the first-line treatment of adult 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is mainly based on data from 452 patients included in the pivotal study A1050, a phase III open 
label study comparing dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first line treatment in patients newly diagnosed stage 
IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC harbouring EGRF-activating mutations. Additionally, data on 45 patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-activating mutations from Cohort A of study A1017 have been 
provided and are considered supportive. 
The applicant has also provided data on other 3 studies of dacomitinib in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC in later lines of therapy: two phase III, double-blind, randomized studies (Study A1009, 
erlotinib-controlled and Study 1011, placebo-controlled) and an open label, randomized phase II study (Study 
A1028, erlotinib-controlled).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study A1050 met its primary objective showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement 
in terms of PFS at the time of primary analysis (DCO: 29 July 2016; IRC; 59.9% of events in the dacomitinib arm 
vs. 79.6% of events in gefitinib arm), with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib (HR 0.589 [95% CI: 0.469, 
0.739]). Treatment with dacomitinib resulted in a 5.5-month improvement in median PFS compared to control 
arm (14.7 months [95% CI: 11.1, 16.6] vs. 9.2 months [95% CI: 9.1, 11.0]). 
PFS results according to investigator assessment (HR: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.57; p-value <0.0001) as different 
sensitivity analyses also support robustness of results.  
Subgroup analyses for PFS showed consistent results in most subgroups analysed except for patients >75 years 
and non-Asian patients.  
Despite there was no difference in terms of ORR (74.9% [95% CI: 68.7, 80.4] in the dacomitinib arm and 71.6% 
[95% CI: 65.2, 77.4] in the gefitinib arm with 12 CR vs. 4 CR respectively) responses were longer in the 
dacomitinib arm than in gefitinib (median 14.8 months vs. 8.3 months).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Final OS results (DCO: 17 Feb 2017) showed an overall HR :0.760 (95% CI: 0.582, 0.993) in favour of 
dacomitinib. While the final readout of OS was statistically significant when assessed on its own, since the 
gate-keeping procedure stopped at the testing of ORR (per IRC review) as ORR was not statistically significant, 
the statistical significance of OS improvement could not be formally assessed.  
Importantly, OS curves crossed and started to separate after 12 months in favour of dacomitinib.  
Overall, the superiority of dacomitinib over gefitinib shown in the ITT population has not been observed in the 
subset of non-Asian population. Nevertheless, a literature review indicated that there is no consistent pattern 
that would suggest that non-Asian patients respond differently from Asian patients to this class of drug. 
Furthermore, the provided PK/PD data do not suggest a biological sharp distinction between Asians and 
non-Asians that can explain the observed difference in the estimated treatment effect between these subgroups. 
Although the efficacy appears less favourable in the non-Asian than in the Asian patients, this could be a chance 
finding. 
There are no data for dacomitinib in patients with activating mutations other than exon 19 deletions or exon 21 
(L858R). Other potentially relevant populations such as patients with brain metastases have been excluded from 
the confirmatory trial in spite of the fact that non-clinical data suggest activity in CNS. These uncertainties have 
been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of dacomitinib is based mainly on data from the pivotal phase III study A1050 and additional 
data from 28 patients from study A1017 Cohort A, with a median exposure of 66.7 weeks. 
The most commonly adverse events with dacomitinib (vs. gefitinib) were diarrhoea (87.2% vs. 55.8%), 
paronychia (61.7% vs. 20.1%), dermatitis acneiform (48.9% vs. 28.6%), stomatitis (43.6% vs. 17.9%), 
decreased appetite (30.8% vs. 24.6%), dry skin (27.8% vs. 17.0%), weight decreased (25.6% vs. 16.5%) and 
alopecia (23.3% vs. 12.5%). 
Grade 3 adverse events were reported in 51.1% of patients and grade 4 in 2.2% (hypokalaemia and mucosal 
inflammation) [29.9% and 2.2% in the gefitinib arm, respectively). The most common grade 3 AEs in the 
dacomitinib arms (vs. gefitinib) were dermatitis acneiform (13.7% vs. 0), diarrhoea (8.4% vs. 0.9%), 
paronychia (7.5% vs. 1.3%), rash (4.4% vs. 0) and rash maculo-papular (4.4% vs. 0.4%). 
Two deaths (0.2%) were related to study drug toxicity (1 event of diarrhoea and a death of unknown cause in 
a patient who had previously reported an AE of grade 3 of drug-liver injury).  
The most frequent treatment-related SAE reported in the dacomitinib arm were diarrhoea, (5 [2.2%]), 
abdominal pain and liver injury (2 [0.9%], each).  
Adverse events of special interest are: diarrhoea (87.2%), stomatitis (43.6%), hepatotoxicity (1.8%), severe 
skin toxicity (3.5%), acute renal failure (4.8%), interstitial lung disease (2.6%), QT interval prolongation 
(1.3%), keratitis (1.8%), left ventricular dysfunction (0.9%), rash/dermatitis acneiform (77.5%) and other skin 
toxicity (76.2%). 
Discontinuation of dacomitinib due to adverse events was reported in 17.6% of patients compared to 12.1% in 
the gefitinib arm. Of these, 9.7% in the datomitinib arm and 6.7% in the gefitinib arm were considered to be

related to study drug, being the most frequently reported with dacomitinib dermatitis acneiform, diarrhoea, ILD, 
pneumonia, rash macula-papular and stomatitis. 
Dose modifications (dose reductions and/or treatment interruptions) were frequent in patients treated wih 
dacomitinib; 66.1% of patients reported at least one dose reduction and 78.0% required temporary treatment 
discontinuation. The main AEs leading to dose reductions or treatment interruption were dermatitis acneiform, 
paronychia and diarrhoea. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no uncertainties on the safety profile that require specific investigation or follow-up post authorisation 
beyond routine pharmacovigilance.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The delay in the tumour progression offered by dacomitinib is considered clinically meaningful. An increased 
survival has been observed although the data are considered exploratory. The outcomes from the pivotal trial 
are especially valuable as the comparator is one of the SoC (gefitinib) commonly used in the clinical practice.  
The safety profile of dacomitinib is inferior to the safety profile of gefitinib, which is reflected in the SmPC, it is 
however considered manageable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the overall population of first line NSCLC patients with either exon 19 deletions or exon 21 mutation (L858R), 
a median gain of 5.5 months PFS with dacomitinib compared to gefitinib outweighs the increase in diarrhoea and 
skin toxicities observed with dacomitinib as well as Grade 3 and serious adverse events.  
In conclusion, the efficacy as demonstrated in the pivotal trial against an effective comparator, is considered 
clinically relevant for Asian and non-Asian patients. Information about the observed differences in PFS results 
between the key subgroups is considered of importance for the prescriber, and reflected in the SmPC.  
The safety profile of dacomitinib is inferior to the safety profile of gefitinib, which is reflected in the SmPC. 
Non-Asian patients seem to have a higher frequency and severity grade of AEs compared to Asians which may 
be explained by a more elderly non-Asian population. The findings in the overall population can be extrapolated 
also to the subgroup of non-Asian patients.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Teduglutide, [gly2]-hGLP-2, is a recombinant analogue of the human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) a 
peptide that is secreted primarily from the lower gastrointestinal tract. Teduglutide is a 33 amino acid 
peptide that differs from GLP-2 in the substitution of glycine for alanine at the second position at the N-
terminus. The single amino acid substitution relative to naturally occurring GLP-2 results in resistance to 
in vivo degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). 
The product has been licensed for the indication “Short Bowel Syndrome in adults” in the year 2012. 
With this variation, the applicant is intending to extend the indication, or rather to extend the population 
to be treated, to the paediatric population aged 1 year and older. The patient population intended to be 
included additionally is essentially a similar population to the adult population, in the sense that it is a 
population in which phases of PN-treatment and current standard of care have already been performed 
for a considerable time, and the so-called “adaptation phase” has already taken place.  
Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a serious, disabling, socially incapacitating and potentially life-threatening 
condition. SBS results from surgical resection, congenital defect, or disease-associated loss of absorption 
and is characterised by the inability to maintain protein-energy, fluid, electrolyte, or micronutrient 
balances when on a conventionally accepted, normal diet. 
Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder. Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of SBS in 
children and adults are difficult to make. Most estimates are based on data describing patients requiring 
long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for SBS. Home parenteral nutrition may be used as a 
surrogate marker for severe intestinal failure. Surveys on HPN in Europe indicated an incidence of 2 to 3 
patients per million and the prevalence was reported to be about 4 per million with a broad range. 
The clinical characteristics of SBS in children are similar to those in adult, defined as a disease where 
there is diminished absorptive capacity for fluids and/or nutrients, sometimes requiring a dependence on 
parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids (PN/IV) support to maintain energy and clinical status. There is 
heterogeneity within SBS. Where some patients with intestinal insufficiency are able to adapt 
metabolically and compensate for their malabsorption of fluids, electrolytes, trace elements, vitamins or 
nutrients by increasing oral/enteral intake, other patients with intestinal failure depend on PN/IV for 
nutritional support. Although PN/IV can provide nutritional support for patients with compromised fluid 
and nutritional status, it is also associated with serious complications, such as infections and liver 
damage. The risk for these effects increases over time with longer duration of PN/IV support. In severe 
cases of SBS, intestinal transplantation may be undertaken, which presents additional comorbidities, 
especially in infants. Intestinal transplantation in infants is more challenging than other organ 
transplants, as the incidence of acute rejection after intestinal transplantation is approximately 85%, and 
there may also be an increased incidence of sepsis as a result of bacterial translocation. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data was submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
In the course of the procedure the applicant referred to non-clinical data submitted within the initial 
marketing authorisation application in order to support the applicability data derived from adults to the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

paediatric setting. This approach is addressed alongside clinical safety and efficacy data further below in 
the report. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, teduglutide is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK modelling was used to describe the PK data from the subjects receiving active treatment in 
Study TED-C13-003: A 12-Week Pharmacokinetic, Safety, and Pharmacodynamic Study of Teduglutide in 
Paediatric Subjects Aged 1 Year through 17 Years, with Short Bowel Syndrome who are Dependent on 
Parenteral Support.  
The model incorporated the paediatric PK data with the previously developed adult population PK model 
based on data collected in five Phase 1 studies and three Phase 2/3 studies in the clinical development of 
teduglutide.  
Six blood samples were drawn during the 12 weeks study in paediatric patients, for the analysis of 
teduglutide PK. The aim of the PK simulation was to compare the systemic exposure of teduglutide at 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 8/62 
 
 
  
  
three different dose levels (0.025, 0.05, and 1.0 mg/kg s.c once daily for 14 days) in adults and 
paediatric SBS patients at different ages. 
A one-compartment disposition with first-order absorption and lag time and allometric exponents for 
parameters Ka, CL/F and Vc/F adequately described the profile of observed plasma concentrations of 
teduglutide over time throughout the studies and across populations of subjects. Due to low number of 
samples PK parameters were presented by descriptive statistics. 
Absorption 
Simulations were performed to compare teduglutide exposure in adult subjects and paediatric SBS 
subjects at unit doses of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 24 hours for 
14 days. Simulated Cmax and Cmin increased with increasing doses as shown in Table 11-13. 
An age-dependent decrease in AUCss was observed in younger children. For example, the simulated 
AUCss following dosing of 0.05 mg/kg resulted in a mean of 308 ng.h/mL in adults and 95.0 ng.h/mL in 
children between 1 and 2 years of age.

EMA/531666/2016 
Page 9/62 
 
 
 
  
  
Distribution 
Following subcutaneous administration, teduglutide has an apparent volume of distribution of 26 litres in 
patients with SBS.  
In the paediatric study TED-C13-003, mean values of Vc/F from 2.42 to 3.56 litres, dependent on the 
dose administered, were observed with large standard deviations and large CV%. Large variabilities in the 
distribution of teduglutide were seen, however, this is expected due to the low number and heterogeneity 
of the patients.  
Elimination 
The mean clearance of teduglutide is approximately equivalent to the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), 
which indicated that teduglutide is mainly cleared by the kidneys. Data from the PopPK analysis showed 
that Creatinine clearance (Clcr) depended on renal function. The half-life is short in both adults (2 hours) 
and in children (0.22 – 0.30 hours), the drug is therefore cleared before the next dose in both 
populations. The renal clearance of teduglutide was confirmed by study CL0600-018 in renally impaired 
volunteers as assessed within the initial marketing authorisation application. Teduglutide was eliminated 
with a t½ of 1.6 and 1.7 hours, respectively, in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, and 
2.2 hours in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with 1.4 to 1.6 hours in healthy 
matched-control subjects.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No formal dose-proportionality analysis was performed, but both AUC, Cmin, and Cmax increased with 
increasing doses in all age groups. 
Special populations 
This application is a line extension for a paediatric indication. 37 children aged 1 – 17 years were included 
in the study. No further special populations were addressed which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new interaction studies were performed which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In study TED-C13-003, the PD effects of teduglutide in terms of PN/IV support changes were evaluated. 
These PD effects will be discussed in the Efficacy section. Plasma citrulline and teduglutide antibodies 
were assessed as well. 
Mechanism of action 
The naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a peptide secreted by L cells of the 
intestine which is known to increase intestinal and portal blood flow, inhibit gastric acid secretion, and 
decrease intestinal motility. Teduglutide is an analogue of GLP-2. In several nonclinical studies, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 11/62 
 
 
 
  
  
teduglutide has been shown to preserve mucosal integrity by promoting repair and normal growth of the 
intestine through an increase of villus height and crypt depth. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In study TED-C13-003, plasma citrulline was measured as an assessment of enterocyte mass. At Week 
12 and EOT, citrulline levels were increased from baseline in a dose-related manner, with the greatest 
increase in the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort. Further the Applicant explored the relationship between reduction 
in the clinical relevant endpoint “reduction in PN/IV – yes/no” and plasma levels of citrulline in the 
paediatric study and no apparent link could be observed.  
Teduglutide antibodies were assessed at baseline, week 12 and 16. Based on the results of the 
immunogenicity test in study TED-C13-003, only one subject had a positive result for the presence of 
teduglutide specific antibodies. Post-hoc and exposure PK parameters derived from the final model for 
subjects taking 0.025 mg/kg (same dose level as Subject in study TED-C13-003 are presented in Table 
4.5.1. PK and exposure parameters for this subject were within the range of those observed for subjects 
with negative immunogenicity test. The presence of antibodies did not affect teduglutide PK parameters 
of this patient.

2.2.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Please refer to the above sections. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
With the use of the sparse PK sampling in the paediatric study TED-C13-003, together with PK samples 
from adult studies, a population PK modelling and simulation analysis was performed to support the 
dosing rationale of teduglutide in paediatric patients with short bowel syndrome. Simulations were 
performed to compare teduglutide exposure in adult subjects and paediatric subjects at unit doses of 
0.025, 0.05, and 0.10 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 24 hours for 14 days. Simulation results 
indicated that paediatric subjects (1-17 years) are expected to display similar steady state Cmin and 
Cmax values of teduglutide as adults. Conversely, simulated AUCs values were highly age-dependent and 
gradually decreased from adults to children. 
Also T½ decreases with age – presumably as a result of higher clearance in the paediatric population.  
However, the half-life is short in both adults (2 hours) and in children (0.22 – 0.30 hours) and the drug is 
cleared before the next dose in both populations therefore and impact on the efficacy of the drug is not 
expected. 
It is recognized that there are PK differences between adults and children showing a lower exposure 
(AUC) and shorter half-life in paediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age, as compared with adults. However, 
Cmax was found to be independent of age and there was a suggestion of dose proportionality for AUCss, 
Cmax and Cmin. Furthermore the demonstrated efficacy in the paediatric clinical trial TED-C13-003 
supports the proposed dosing, and the primary relevance of Cmax (peak concentrations), rather than 
exposure (Cmin or AUC). Therefore it was considered that there was sufficient evidence to support the 
recommendation for a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight once daily in both children and adults. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 13/62 
 
 
  
  
Teduglutide is eliminated primarily through the kidneys through a mechanism involving both glomerular 
filtration and tubular catabolism. A physiological difference in clearance (and following lower AUC and 
shorter half-life) between children and adults is possible related to the renal elimination of the drug. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of teduglutide children with renal impairment are expected to be 
exposed to higher concentrations and thus a dose reduction of 50% is reasonable in children with 
moderate and severe renal impairment and ESRD as included in 4.2 of the SmPC. Furthermore the limited 
data from children with moderate to severe renal impairment and ESRD is mentioned in 5.2 if the SmPC 
which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
In study TED-C13-003, the PD effects of teduglutide were assessed by PN/IV support, plasma citrulline 
and teduglutide antibodies. PN/IV support will be further discussed in the efficacy section. Plasma 
citrulline and teduglutide antibodies were measured at baseline and at 12 weeks (end of study). Only one 
patient was tested antibody positive and there were no impact on the teduglutide PK. Plasma citrulline 
increased from baseline to 12 weeks, and was supposed to reflect an increased enterocyte mass. 
However, the Applicant has explored the relationship between reduction in the clinical relevant endpoint 
“reduction in PN/IV – yes/no” and plasma levels of citrulline in the paediatric study and no apparent link 
could be observed.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Similar Cmax of teduglutide across age groups was demonstrated by population pharmacokinetics 
modelling and there was a suggestion of dose proportionality for AUCss, Cmax and Cmin. Cmax was more 
predictive of the effect based on study TEDC13-003 (see also efficacy part of this assessment report) and 
it is considered that there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation for a dose of 0.05 mg/kg 
body weight once daily in both children and adults. 
Nevertheless the pharmacokinetic profile of teduglutide in this paediatric population, as evaluated by 
clearance and volume of distribution was different from that observed in adults after correcting for body 
weights. Specifically, clearance decreases with increasing age from 1 year old to adults and this is 
appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of teduglutide children with renal impairment are expected to be 
exposed to higher concentrations and thus a dose reduction of 50% is reasonable in children with 
moderate and severe renal impairment and ESRD as included in 4.2 of the SmPC. Furthermore the limited 
data from children with moderate to severe renal impairment and ESRD is mentioned in 5.2 if the SmPC 
which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Title of Study 
A 12-Week Pharmacokinetic, Safety, and Pharmacodynamic Study of Teduglutide in Pediatric Subjects 
Aged 1 through 17 Years, with Short Bowel Syndrome who are Dependent on Parenteral Support 
Methods 
The pivotal study TED-C13-003, was an open-label, 4-cohort study in which approximately 8 subjects in 
each of the 3 active cohorts were to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of teduglutide. An attempt was 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 14/62 
 
  
  
made to enroll up to 12 subjects into an observational cohort who would receive standard of care 
treatment. Three doses of teduglutide, 0.0125 mg/kg/day, 0.025 mg/kg/day, and 0.05 mg/kg/day, were 
investigated for 12 weeks in a staggered sequential approach starting with the lowest dose. All subjects 
were screened for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to SOT to verify the requirements for nutritional support 
for each subject and to ensure adherence to eligibility parameters. Subjects were to be enrolled in the 
study for 16 weeks.

Treatments 
Daily doses of 0.0125, 0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide were administered in the morning to 
the subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The dose calculation was based on body weight 
measured at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2). No adjustments to dose were made during the study period. 
Teduglutide was administered by SC injection once daily into 1 of the 4 quadrants of the abdomen (in 
subjects without a stoma) or either thigh or arm. Cohort 4 received standard of care (no placebo). 
Subject compliance with study drug dosing was monitored by the sponsor or designee by counting and 
examining used and unused vials. In addition, compliance was to be checked by site personnel at every 
visit by asking the subject or the subject’s parent or guardian if they had administered the study drug 
according to instructions. 
Compliance was considered achieved if the subject had at least 80% of the planned doses administered. 
Objectives 
The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the PK profile, safety and tolerability, and 
pharmacodynamic effects of teduglutide compared with standard of care in paediatric subjects (aged 1 
year through 17 years) with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
A PD endpoint of a 10% or greater reduction in PN/IV support at the end of 12 weeks of treatment 
compared to baseline was considered to be a valid PD marker of increased intestinal absorptive capacity. 
In the adult study, CL0600-020, 26 of the 30 subjects (86.9%) who ultimately had a 20% reduction in 
PN/IV volume already had a 10% reduction after 12 weeks of teduglutide treatment. Looking at the 
relationship from the other direction, 26 of the 31 subjects (83.8%) who had a 10% reduction in PN/IV 
volume at 12 weeks went on to have a 20% reduction by 6 months of teduglutide treatment. These data 
supported a 10% decrease at Week 12 as a predictor of pharmacodynamic effect.  
In addition to the PD endpoint of ≥ 10% reduction in PN/IV support, other PD endpoints included: 
•  ≥ 20% reduction in PN/IV support 
•  An increase in enteral nutritional tolerance (calories and volume) 
•  A decrease in parenteral support (calories and volume)

•  Ostomy output/stool balance testing (at selected sites) 
•  Urine output (mL/day) 
•  Weight gain or stabilization (Z-scores calculated based on individual institutional 
guidelines/standards including adjusting for gestational age), height (length) 
•  Changes in plasma citrulline from baseline to Weeks 12 (or EOT) 
•  Change in PN/IV support 4 weeks after EOT compared to baseline 
• 
If applicable, change in PN/IV support 3 and 6 months after EOT compared to baseline for those 
who developed antibodies specific to teduglutide 
•  Change in hours per day or days per week of PN/IV as well as any subjects who were able to 
completely wean off PN/IV support 
Sample size 
The small sample size resulting from the small study population required the use of descriptive statistics 
with a goal of summarizing the sample. Continuous variables, including those assessed on a discrete 
scale, were summarized using descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation (SD), maximum, and minimum. For categorical variables, statistical summaries 
included number of subjects and percentages. 
Randomisation 
This was a non-randomised study. At any time during the 2-week minimum screening period, the subject 
or subject’s parent/guardian/caretaker decided whether to participate in the dosing cohort or the 
standard of care cohort. The timing of the subject’s screening period determined which dosing cohort was 
available for the subject to enter. At the end of the screening period, the investigator reviewed and 
confirmed that the subject continued to meet all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. If the subject qualified, the 
subject was provided with study drug at the dose level associated with the cohort that was enrolling at 
the time. Those subjects opting for the standard of care cohort continued in the study, but without clinical 
supplies. There were no cases of cross-over. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study medication was administered in an open-label fashion during the study. 
Statistical methods 
PK/PD Analysis Population 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all subjects who enrolled into the trial. The ITT 
population was the primary analysis population analysed for PK/PD endpoints. 
The Per Protocol (PP) population consisted of all subjects in the ITT population who completed the study 
without meeting any of the following conditions: 
1.  Missing PK data at both baseline and postbaseline 
2.  Absence of Week 12 visit 
3.  Non-compliance to study drug for the treatment group 
4.  Discrepancies between planned and actual treatment 
The PP population was the secondary analysis population analysed for PD endpoints. 
Safety Analysis Population 
The Safety Population consisted of all subjects in the ITT population who received at least one dose of 
study medication or standard of care. For reporting purposes, these subjects were included in the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 18/62 
 
  
  
treatment group reflective of the treatment they actually received, regardless of the treatment group they 
were assigned to. All safety analyses were conducted on this population, unless otherwise specified. For 
this study, the safety population was identical to the intent-to-treat population. 
Analysis of pharmacodynamic variables 
All pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted on the ITT and PP population. Analyses of PN/IV support 
and enteral nutrition support included 2 sets of results based on 2 data sources: subject diary data and 
the investigator prescribed data. 
The actual weekly PN volume, EN volume (by mouth and by tube feeding), ostomy output, and urine 
output were calculated based on the daily volumes recorded in subjects’ diaries within 7 days prior to 
each scheduled visit. The calculation followed the formula below. 
Weekly value = (sum of daily values in the diary/number of days with values) * 7 
Missing daily PN or EN volumes were not imputed. If there were more than 2 days of missing diary data 
within an interval, the interval was classified as missing actual volume information. An exception to this 
rule was the baseline visit. For this visit, actual volume was based on all diaries prior to the first dose 
date. Data were summarised at all scheduled visits. An EOT time point was also added.

Protocol deviation data were collected from monitoring reports. Protocol deviations from these reports 
were consolidated into a deviation log at the Contract Research Organization, which transferred the log to 
NPS during the study and after the data base lock. The number and percent of subjects with protocol 
deviations were presented for each treatment group and all subjects combined. There was no interim 
analysis performed for this study.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population included all subjects who were enrolled in the study. This was the primary study 
population used to evaluate pharmacodynamic measures of efficacy. The Safety population was identical 
to the ITT population. The PP population consisted of all subjects in the ITT population who completed the 
study without meeting any of the following conditions:  
1. Missing PK data at both baseline and post-baseline;  
2. Absence of Week 12 visit,  
3. Non-compliance to study drug for the treatment group, and  
4. Discrepancies between planned and actual treatment.  
The PP population was the secondary analysis population analysed for PD endpoints. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Complete Weaning 
Based on physician-prescribed data, a total of 4 of 37 (10.8%) subjects in the ITT population had 
completely weaned off of PN at the EOT visit. These subjects included 3 of 15 (20.0%) subjects in the 
0.05 mg/kg/day cohort and 1 of 14 (7.1%) subjects in the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort. One subject in the 
0.05 mg/kg/day cohort achieved this goal by Week 4. 
Reduction in PN volume support 
The mean decrease in PN/IV volume from baseline at Week 12 based on physician-prescribed data was -
2.78 (± 1.99) and -2.57 (± 3.56) L/week in the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. These 
corresponded to a -37.34% (± 26.42) and a -39.11% (± 40.79) mean decrease, respectively, compared 
with a -9.95% (± 21.63) decrease in the 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohort and a 7.38% (± 12.76) increase in 
the standard of care cohort. Four weeks following EOT (Week 16), PN/IV volume reductions were still 
seen in all dosing cohorts, although these were less robust than those at Week 12 in the 0.025 and 0.05 
mg/kg/day cohorts, when subjects were still receiving teduglutide. The mean change in PN/IV volume in 
the standard of care and the 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohorts continued to decline slightly during the 4 post-
treatment weeks. 
Reduction in total PN caloric intake 
Based on physician-prescribed data in the ITT population, reductions from baseline at Week 12 in total PN 
caloric intake were -35.16% (± 38.78) and -35.11% (± 53.04) in the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts, 
respectively. Changes in the standard of care and teduglutide 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohorts were 4.31% (± 
5.36) and -10.04% (± 26.10), respectively. At Week 16, this effect was still evident, with PN/IV calories 
decreasing further in the 0.05 mg/kg/day (n = 14) and standard of care cohorts (n = 5), increasing 
slightly in the 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohort (n = 7) and staying at a similar level in the 0.025 mg/kg/day 
cohort (n = 13).

Mean decreases from baseline at Week 12 in the number of days/week of PN/IV required, based on 
physician-prescribed data, were -0.69 (± 1.97) days/week and -1.36 (± 2.37) days/week, corresponding 
to a percentage decrease of -10.77% (± 29.00) days/week and -24.49% (± 42.46) days/week in the 
0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. There was no change from baseline in either the 0.0125 
mg/kg/day or standard of care cohorts. These decreases translated to a reduction in days on PN/IV 
support. Based on physician-prescribed data in the ITT population at Week 12, 1 subject in the 0.025 
mg/kg/day cohort had a 3-day or more reduction in days on PN/IV. Four subjects in the 0.05 mg/kg/day 
cohort achieved a 3-day or greater reduction in days on PN/IV. No subjects in the standard of care or 
0.0125 mg/kg/day cohorts achieved a reduction of days on PN/IV support. Based on subject diary data at 
Week 12, subjects in the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts had mean decreases from baseline of 3.94 
(± 3.75) and 4.18 (± 4.08) hours, respectively, in daily PN usage, corresponding to mean percentage 
reductions of -27.41% (± 33.52) and -35.55% (± 35.23), respectively. Subjects in the standard of care 
and 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohorts showed minimal changes in this parameter at the same time point. 
Increase in Enteral Volume and Calories 
Based on subject diary data, mean enteral volume at Week 12 increased from baseline by 50.93% (± 
61.42) in the 0.025 cohort and by 57.96% (± 44.95) in the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort, compared with 
23.50% (± 22.06) in the 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohort and 16.82% (± 14.92) in the standard of care cohort. 
Four weeks after the end of teduglutide treatment (Week 16), EN intake was maintained in the 0.05 
mg/kg/day cohort (n = 9), while dropping slightly in the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort (n = 11). The standard 
of care cohort (n = 4) also showed an increase in EN volume at Week 16. There were data for only 1 
subject in the 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohort at Week 16. The increases in EN intake in the active treatment 
cohorts corresponded to increases in EN calories, which were highest in the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort. At 
Week 12 in the ITT population, the percentage increase from baseline in prescribed EN calories in the 
0.05 mg/kg/day cohort was 58.80% (± 64.20) compared with 53.10% (± 63.76) and 17.09% (± 20.50) 
in the 0.025 and 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. The standard of care cohort, in which an 
increase in PN volume was observed, also had an increase in EN calories (57.02% [± 55.25]), indicating 
that the key goal in paediatric SBS intestinal rehabilitation is the concept of advancing enteral feeds. At 
Week 16, intake of EN calories continued to rise, with percentage increases from baseline of 59.63% (± 
52.62), 28.37 (± 40.11), 56.13% (± 67.78) and 64.57% (± 57.53) in the standard of care and the 
teduglutide 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. These changes corresponded to 
changes from Week 12 to Week 16 of 2.33% (± 4.65), 6.36% (± 12.21), 1.52% (± 4.96) and 7.09% (± 
22.43) in the standard of care and 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. 
Maintenance of clinical nutritional status 
Concurrent with decreases in PN volume, subjects treated with teduglutide maintained their clinical 
nutritional status, as evidenced by stability of laboratory parameters, weight and height parameters, 
indicating effective EN absorption of nutrients and fluids.  
Changes in Plasma Citrulline 
Plasma citrulline levels at all 3 time points measured (Week 12, EOT and Week 16) were increased from 
baseline in a dose-related manner, with the greatest increase in the teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort. 
Citrulline was not measured in the standard of care cohort. Although the increases were still evident at 
Week 16, they had decreased from the Week 12 level. 
Subjects Who Achieved at Least a 20% PN Volume Reduction 
By Week 12 in the ITT population, 10/14 (71.4%) and 8/15 (53.3%) subjects in the 0.025 and 0.05 
mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively, had achieved a 20% or greater reduction in PN/IV volume compared 
with no subjects in the standard of care cohort and 1/8 (12.5%) subjects in the 0.0125 mg/kg/day 
cohort, based on physician-prescribed data. Eight out of 14 (57.1%) subjects in the 0.025 mg/kg/day 
cohort and 9/15 subjects (60.0%) in the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort achieved a 20% or greater calorie 
reduction. No subjects in the standard of care cohort achieved this milestone and 1/8 (12.5%) subjects 
achieved a 20% calorie reduction at Week 12 in the 0.0125 cohort. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 26/62 
 
  
  
Comparable results were seen when based on subject diary data and the per-protocol populations as well 
as for the 10% reduction in PN supplements.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of PN volume change from baseline was evaluated in the ITT population by etiology of 
SBS, remaining length of small intestine, presence of a stoma, and presence of a colon. Due to the small 
sample size, results of these subset analyses are inconclusive and, at best, only can offer a suggestion of 
influence. 
The majority of subjects in all study cohorts had a colon and did not have a stoma and, therefore, 
reduction totals at Week 12 in these 2 subsets were similar to the overall totals. There were too few 
subjects without a colon to be able to assess the impact of this parameter. Similarly, only 1 subject in 
each of the 3 dosing cohorts had a stoma and no standard of care subject had a stoma. Therefore, no 
conclusions can be drawn from these. 
Overall, the subjects’ etiology of SBS was distributed evenly between necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut 
volvulus, gastroschisis, and “other” causes. Intestinal atresia was the reason for intestinal resection in 3 
subjects. As in the colon and stoma subgroups, the PN reductions across the study cohorts were similar 
to the overall totals. 
The subset analyses for remaining length of small intestine evaluated subjects with less than and greater 
than or equal to 25 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm. Therefore, the categories of 25 and 40 cm were subsets of 
the 60-cm group. The mean and median reductions of PN volume at Week 12 in all length categories 
were similar to that seen overall. Except for subjects in the ≥ 60 cm and < 60 cm category in the 
standard of care cohort for which data was available for only 2 subjects, within the 2 highest dosing 
cohorts and the other length categories in the standard of care cohort, subjects with greater remaining 
length of small intestine showed a slightly higher reduction percentage than subjects with a smaller 
amount of intestine remaining. In the 0.0125 mg/kg/day dosing cohort, however, the opposite was true. 
The change in PN calories by subgroups was also provided for the ITT population based on physician 
prescribed data for etiology of SBS, remaining intestinal length, presence of stoma, and presence of 
colon, respectively.

Extrapolation 
Because only a non-randomised, short-term study was been presented to support the indication in 
children, further justification was provided in the course of the procedure to support that the data 
observed in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population.  
The applicant bases their answer on four parts related to the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Similarities in disease characteristics and course of the disease for adults and children 
The pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The efficacy and safety from clinical trials 
Similar disease characteristics: 
The applicant made the case that although the cause for surgical resections of the bowel might be 
different between children and adults (in children: NEC and volvulus, atresia, gastroschisis which do not 
occur in adults), the resulting disease with diminished absorptive capacity for fluids and nutrients is the 
same, including the resulting manifestations such as malabsorption, diarrhoea, steatorrhea, abdominal 
pain, fluid/electrolyte disturbance, dehydration, and weight loss. 
A further argument in favour of similarities is the postulate that the occurrence and character, as well as 
the management of SBS complications is also similar in adults and children. The consequences of 
insufficient adaptation/compensation are usually treated with IV/PN support, and the resulting 
complications are – both in children and adults – liver disease, catheter-related infections (including 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 29/62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
sepsis), venous thrombosis, and dwindling central venous access. The further stimulation of potential 
compensation mechanisms by enteral feeding is also considered similar in the two groups. 
Differences between adults and children concern the likelihood of being weaned off, which is higher in 
children, leading to about 60% of the initially PN/IV dependent infants and small children being weaned 
off by the age of 5. Intestinal transplantation remains an option, especially for children, however, this is 
considered more challenging and in the end unsuccessful, compared to solid organ transplantation (with 
about 85% acute resections). 
Pre-clinical pharmacology: 
The applicant first refers to the fact that Teduglutide treatment has been shown in animal models and 
adult humans to induce mucosal growth, mainly in the small intestine, through an increase of crypt cell 
proliferation and a reduction of enterocyte apoptosis. 
Further reference was made to the neonatal pig model of SBS, which was chosen to be investigated due 
to anatomic and physiological similarities between infants and piglets, and is regarded to be an 
established model of intestinal failure (Study SP10-002-0600). 
The data in neonatal piglets demonstrate that teduglutide structural and transiently increases functional 
measures of intestinal adaptation similar to that observed in adult animals of other species. Teduglutide 
improved (p <0.05) mucosal surface area (villus height: duodenum, jejunum, ileum; crypt depth: ileum, 
colon; proliferation: duodenum, jejunum, ileum; colon; apoptosis: jejunum, ileum, colon) and acute 
nutrient processing capacity (glucose: duodenum, jejunum, ileum; glutamine: duodenum, jejunum).. 
The results of a 13-week study with teduglutide conducted in juvenile minipigs indicated that there were 
no new or unique toxicities in juvenile minipigs as compared to young adult mice, rats and monkeys 
(Study #66585). 
Efficacy from clinical trials: 
With regard to efficacy, the applicant refers to the results adult study CL0600-020 (responder rates as 
per 20% to 100% reduction of PN/IV bolume at weeks 20 and 24 which was 62.8% for active treatment 
and 30.2% for placebo) and compares this with the results of the children’s study TED-C13-003 (where 
an at least 20% reduction of PN/IV needs was achieved by 71.4% and 53.3% in the 0.025 mg/kg/day 
and 0.05 mg/kg/day cohorts) as well as other results. A “synoptic table” for these results is presented, 
which is shown in the following:

Safety in clinical trials: 
The applicant postulated that the overall safety profile in the paediatric TED-C13-003 study was 
consistent with that observed in the adult studies in an SBS patient population. Below a summary of the 
adverse events reported in the CSR of study TED-C13-003 is described which matches with the current 
information on adults of Chapter 4.8 of the SmPC: 
- 
- 
- 
The most commonly reported adverse events reported in >3 (>10%) patients in the total 
teduglutide group were: vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, catheter-related infection, 
pyrexia, cough, abdominal pain, blood bicarbonate decreased, fatigue, headache, nausea, central 
line infection, diarrhea, increased fecal volume. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. 
The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events reported in >1 patient in the total 
teduglutide group were: abdominal pain, abdominal distention, eyes sunken, headache, injection 
site haemorrhage, nausea, painful defecation and vomiting. 
The most commonly reported serious adverse events reported in >1 patient in the total 
teduglutide group were: central line infection, pyrexia, catheter-related complication and 
parainfluenza virus infection. None of the reported SAEs were considered by the investigator to be 
drug-related. 
Other adverse events reported in the pediatric trial but not present in the SmPC usually reflected 
complications of the indwelling catheter used for TPN (catheter-related infection, central line infection, 
catheter-related complication), adverse events that may reflect the underlying disease in children (blood 
bicarbonate decreased, fatigue, diarrhea, increased fecal volume) or adverse events that reflect 
teduglutide administration route (injection site haemorrhage). 
No new or unexpected safety signals were observed in paediatric patients treated with teduglutide for 12 
weeks at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg/d. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has undertaken a combined PK/PD clinical study in the paediatric population. The 
population comprised paediatric patients in the age range of 1-17 with SBS requiring PN. The inclusion 
criteria defined an adequate patient population for which the process of adaptation was likely to have 
been completed, and a further reduction of PN needs and/or weaning from PN was not expected. The 
patient population appeared therefore adequate, although an optimisation phase for the PN therapy was 
not included in the study. 
The study was conducted open-label and in non-randomised fashion, with a staggered approach starting 
with the lowest dose group. The control group was taken from a small group of patients treated with 
current standard of care. Despite the non-randomised nature of the study, it appears that the baseline 
characteristics of the included patient population in the different dose groups was sufficiently comparable. 
Therefore, the results achieved in the study do not suffer from confounding through differential baseline 
conditions, and can be counted to reflect real clinical effects. 
The study recruited 42 patients into the four different treatment groups and used a 12-week treatment 
period only. The study was conducted with an explorative approach from a statistical point of view only. 
A paediatric investigational plan (PIP) was agreed upon in 2013, and modified in 2015 with the 
acceptance of enrolling 5 patients in the standard of care group. In the PIP, a study duration of 12 weeks 
with 4 weeks follow-up was agreed upon. The primary endpoint agreed upon in the PIP was the change in 
percentage of parenteral support in terms of both volume and calories from baseline to the end of the 12-
week treatment period, and results were to be reported by descriptive statistics. In the submitted study  
reduction in PN calories at week 12 was included as secondary endpoint.

EMA/531666/2016 
Page 31/62 
 
 
  
  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 12 weeks teduglutide treatment was associated with a reduction in parenteral nutrition PN/IV 
support in terms of volume and calories in children aged 1-14 years, when compared with the group of 
children treated with standard of care. Three different dose levels were evaluated: 0.0125, 0.025, and 
0.05 mg/kg. The adult dose of 0.05 mg/kg was also chosen for the paediatric population.  
The number of patients achieving a 10% and 20% reduction in PN/IV volume and calories use were 
higher in the 0.025 mg/kg (71%) and 0.05 mg/kg (53%) dose groups compared with the lowest dose of 
0.0125 mg/kg (12.5%) and the standard of care group (0%). The absolute and percent changes in PN/IV 
volume and calories were about 2.7 L/week and 1800 kcal/week, translating into a percent change of 
about 37% in the two highest dose groups. Days of PN/IV usage was estimated to be reduced by 1.3 
days per week in the 0.05 mg/kg dose group and 0.69 days per week in the 0.025 mg/kg group. Four 
patients were completely weaned off at 12 weeks; however, 2 patients had resumed PN/IV support at 
week 16. These subjects included 3 of 15 (20.0%) subjects in the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort and 1 of 14 
(7.1%) subjects in the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort. 
To address the CHMP concern that the effect on PN/IV support for the 0.025 mg/kg dose was not 
distinguishable from the effect of the highest dose further data were provided showing that patients in 
the 0.025 mg/kg group had a significantly longer residual gut at baseline when compared with patients in 
the 0.05 mg/kg group. Thus, the absorptive capacity in the 0.025 mg/kg group was higher. This explains 
the observed efficacy being comparable in both groups. 
Further arguments in support of the choice of the 0.05 mg/kg dose where brought forward by the 
applicant such as a faster clearance in children compared to adults and the association of higher systemic 
levels of teduglutide in children with increased likelihood of response (20% PN reduction) as well as 
decreases in weekly PN/IV volume difference from baseline according to PK-PD modelling. Overall, the 
Applicant has in a satisfactory manner justified the proposed dose of 0.05 mg/kg. 
The evaluation of the results of the trial has shown a consistent dose-response relationship in the chosen 
pharmacodanymic parameters, showing relatively high activity of the compound for the reduction of PN 
volumes and PN calories in the two high-dose groups. This effect was consistent in the ITT and PP 
evaluation and for different parameters. The standard of care group, and partly also the low-dose group, 
did not show consistent effects on these parameters, thus providing some evidence of “assay sensitivity” 
of the trial, and the validity/appropriateness of the included patient population (which does not improve 
spontaneously to a relevant extent). 
The evaluation of the reduction of infusion times (based on hours or days) as well as the categorical 
evaluation of the infusion times (at least 1 day, at least 3 days), did confirm the results of the volumetric 
and calorimetric evaluations, with both high-dose groups showing even effects considered to be relevant 
from a clinical point of view. These conclusions are also supported by the categorical evaluations of the 
“at least 10% PN volume reduction” and “at least 20% PN volume reduction” endpoints. 
The data on enteral volume and especially calorie increases are less convincing, especially for the calorie 
intake which showed highly similar results across all treatment groups. The applicant explains this with 
the principal mechanism of action (enhancement of absorption of nutrients by increased villous height 
and crypt depth, and hence an improved nutritional intake despite constant caloric count for the given 
intake) and the potential problem of incomplete recording of the total oral intake, when there was an 
increase of additional “ad lib” oral non formula food. The applicant has therefore pointed to a potential 
“confounder” which cannot be accounted for (the improved absorption). Nevertheless the rational was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The evaluation of the potentially clinically most relevant parameters, the complete weaning from PN need 
does again show effects indicating clinical efficacy at least for the highest dose of 0.05 mg/kg. This 
evaluation suffers from the low numbers of patients included and achieving this endpoint (3/15 in the 
highest dose group) but can be seen in the context of the data generated with adults. 
In the adult studies, a 20% reduction in the PN/IV support is considered clinically relevant, and a superior 
effect of teduglutide was seen already after 8-12 weeks. The effect increased over time with more than 
70% of patients reaching a 20% reduction in PN/IV volume at 6 months. Similar results were seen for the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 32/62 
 
  
  
doses 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg in the paediatric population, supporting that also the paediatric population 
accordingly benefits in the long term from teduglutide treatment. Furthermore, one day off PN/IV support 
is also considered relevant for paediatric patients. 
Because only a non-randomised, short-term study was been presented to support the indication in 
children, further argumentation to support the extrapolation of evidence of efficacy from adults was 
provided in the course of the procedure.  
Disease characteristics and course of the disease 
The Applicant argued that in children SBS is caused by congenital abnormalities or major surgical 
resection due to intestinal disease. In older children and adults SBS may be due to IBD, trauma or 
cancer. The clinical manifestation of the disease are similar and due to diminished absorption, which leads 
to malabsorption, diarrhea leading to dehydration and malnutrition, abdominal pain, fluid and electrolyte 
disturbances, etc. It is agreed that the management and complications of SBS are similar between adults 
and children. The only relevant difference is obviously the chances in being fully weaned from IV/PN, 
which is relevantly higher for (at least small) children. This could be regarded to be relevant due to the 
short follow-up of the presented study TED-C13-003. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The Applicant argued that the effect of teduglutide seen in adults, can be extrapolated also based on 
preclinical data. The Applicant referred to data from non-clinical studies part of the initial marketing 
authorisation with neonatal piglets, showing that teduglutide leads to similar structural and transient 
increases in functional measures of intestinal adaptation as those observed in the adult animals. 
Efficacy and safety from clinical trials 
The Applicant provided data comparing mean change from baseline in PV/IN volume at week 12 between 
adults (study 020) and children (study 003). Although, there are limitations to this direct comparison due 
to the non-randomised nature of the paediatric study, similar effects of teduglutide are observed in both 
populations.  
With regard to safety, the most common AEs in the adult population were abdominal pain, vomiting, 
nausea, injection site reactions, headache, peripheral oedema, etc. The same AE pattern was observed in 
the paediatric population. No new or unexpected safety signals were observed in paediatric patients 
treated with teduglutide for 12 weeks at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg/d.  
Based on the disease characteristics, course of disease, the preclinical and clinical data from the adult 
population, there is sufficient data to conclude that the data observed in adults can be used to draw 
conclusions on efficacy in the paediatric population. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The applicant could show clinical relevant effects of treatment with Revestive within a combined PK/PD 
and clinical study in children and adolescents over a 12-week treatment period. Based on the disease 
characteristics, course of disease, the preclinical and clinical data from the adult population, there is 
sufficient data to conclude that the data observed in adults can be used to draw conclusions on efficacy in 
the paediatric population. 
In particular the number of patients achieving a 10% and 20% reduction in PN/IV volume and calories 
were higher in the 0.025 mg/kg (71%) and 0.05 mg/kg (53%) dose groups compared with the lowest 
dose of 0.0125 mg/kg (12.5%) and the standard of care group (0%). 
The evaluation of the potentially clinically most relevant parameters, the complete weaning from PN need 
did again show effects indicating clinical efficacy at least for the highest dose of 0.05 mg/kg. This 
evaluation suffers from the low numbers of patients included and achieving this endpoint (3/15 in the 
highest dose group) but can be seen in the context of the data generated with adults. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 33/62 
 
  
  
In the adult studies, a 20% reduction in the PN/IV support is considered clinically relevant, and a superior 
effect of teduglutide was seen already after 8-12 weeks. The effect increased over time with more than 
70% of patients reaching a 20% reduction in PN/IV volume at 6 months. Similar results after 12 weeks 
were seen for the doses 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg in the paediatric population, supporting that also the 
paediatric population accordingly benefits in the long term from teduglutide treatment. Furthermore, one 
day off PN/IV support is also considered relevant for paediatric patients. 
The presented data in paediatric patients shows a comparable clinical activity of the compound to adults, 
showing a clear dose-response, and producing clinically relevant effects in the dose proposed for 
marketing. In the context of the adult data clinical efficacy in the applied indication is considered to be 
demonstrated. 
Furthermore the applicant took the opportunity for an editorial change of the indication statement 
deleting the term “after surgery” (“Patients should be stable following a period of intestinal adaptation 
after surgery) which was considered acceptable by the CHMP since all patient (adults and paediatric 
patients) undergo surgery. 
2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current SmPC summarizes the safety profile of the compound as follows: 
Adverse reactions were retrieved from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies with Revestive in 109 patients 
with SBS treated with doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.10 mg/kg/day for up to 24 weeks. Approximately 
52% of the patients treated with Revestive experienced adverse reactions (versus 36% of the patients 
given placebo). The most commonly reported adverse reactions were abdominal pain and distension 
(49%), respiratory tract infections (28%), nausea (27%), injection site reactions (21%), headache 
(17%), vomiting (14%) and oedema peripheral (10%). Approximately 38% of the treated patients with a 
stoma experienced gastrointestinal stoma complications. The majority of these reactions were mild or 
moderate. 
No new safety signals have been identified in patients exposed to 0.05 mg/kg/day of Revestive for up to 
30 months in a long-term open-label extension study.

To further evaluate whether the increased number of TEAE terms/patient reported at site  reflected a 
unique safety profile in these patients, an evaluation of TEAE terms, by PT, for these 3 patients was 
conducted (Table 5). Overall, the TEAEs reported in the 3 patients ≥ 5 times included: vomiting (17 
events), abdominal pain (12 events), fatigue (10 events), headache (10 events), GI stoma complication 
(5 events) and nausea (5 events). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Seventeen of 37 subjects (45.9%) in the active dosing cohorts reported 34 TESAEs during the study 
(8/15 subjects [53.3%] in the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort, 6/14 [42.9%] in the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort, and 
3/8 [37.5%] in the 0.0125 mg/kg/day cohort). Three of 5 subjects (60.0%) had TESAEs in the standard 
of care cohort. None of the TESAEs was thought to be related to teduglutide treatment by the 
investigator. The system organ class with the most frequently reported TESAEs were Infections and 
Infestations (10/37 [27.0%] subjects) and general disorders and administration site conditions (9/37 
[24.3%] subjects) (Table 3).  
The most frequently reported TESAEs were central line infection and pyrexia, each reported by 4 of 37 
(10.8%) subjects. Catheter-related complication was reported by 3 (8.1%) subjects and parainfluenza 
virus infection was reported by 2 (5.4%) subjects. All other TESAEs were reported by one subject each.

Laboratory findings 
Mean and median changes from baseline in laboratory values by visit are provided for serum chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis analytes, and no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in the analytes 
were seen overall.  
Liver function tests 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 39/62 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Liver disease is a co-morbidity associated with PN/IV treatment. Table 12-6 displays an example of the 
change from baseline in alanine and alkaline phosphatases to Week 12. Liver function test values showed 
improvement or little or no change from baseline in the active treatment cohorts. There were 10 shifts 
from normal at baseline to high at Week 12, which occurred in across all dosing cohorts. However, there 
were 19 shifts from high at baseline to normal at Week 12 across the 3 dosing cohorts. There were no 
shifts from high to normal in the standard of care cohort.  
One subject had increases in hepatobiliary enzymes that were reported as a TEAE. This subject had 
elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase reported on Study Day 30. They were 
not considered related to study drug by the investigator and were not considered to be clinically 
significant.  
There were no clinically meaningful mean changes from baseline in lipid levels, haematology, or 
urinalysis, nor did shift tables for these parameters suggest any meaningful trends.  
Nutritional status was maintained over the 12-week treatment period, as evidenced by stable levels of 
albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. In addition, weight also remained stable. 
No clinically meaningful differences in other vital sign parameters or physical examinations were observed 
during the study period.  
One subject had an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that was considered clinically significant at the 
Week 16 visit (off teduglutide), but the results of a follow-up echocardiogram for a suspected heart 
murmur was normal. The event was reported as an AE. No medical intervention was needed, and the 
event resolved. No other abnormal, clinically significant ECG results were reported. 
Immunological events 
One subject developed non-neutralising teduglutide-specific antibodies at the Week-16 follow-up visit. 
The subject had no evidence of hypersensitivity or immune-related clinical symptoms. Follow-up testing 
done 3 months later was negative.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Neither of the two early discontinuations from the study were due to adverse events. 
Post marketing experience 
Teduglutide (as Revestive) was first approved in the EU on 30 Aug 2012 for the treatment of adult 
patients with SBS. It was approved in the United States on 21 Dec 2012, for the treatment of adults with 
SBS who are dependent on parenteral support. On 09 Oct 2013, the Marketing Authorization in the EU for 
Revestive was transferred to NPS Pharma Holdings Limited. Approval was granted in Israel for teduglutide  
on 13 Aug 2014.  
From 01 Sep 2012 through the data cutoff date of 30 Aug 2015 as recorded in the Periodic Safety Update 
Report (PSUR) 6 submitted to Regulatory Authorities (dated 06 Nov 2015), the cumulative postmarketing 
exposure was estimated at 690 person-years of exposure, in 900 patients who received either commercial 
product, compassionate use product, or named patient program product, in the US, EU, Norway, Israel 
and Argentina. Of the exposure of 900 patients from the postmarketing experience, approximately 7 
patients were age < 17. 
There were no AEs reported amongst children and adolescents in the latest PSUR interval (01 Sep 2012 
through 30 Aug 2015). Cumulatively, the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
occurred in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) of 
Gastrointestinal disorders, with a cumulative total of 1,055 AEs, 408 of which were serious. The most 
commonly reported (≥ 25) Preferred terms were Nausea (172 AEs), Abdominal pain (165 AEs), 
Abdominal distention, (104 AEs), Diarrhoea (95 AEs), Vomiting (86 AEs), Fatigue (47 AEs), Constipation 
(44 AEs), Abdominal pain upper (41 AEs), Flatulence (34 AEs), Intestinal obstruction (28 AEs), and 
Abdominal discomfort (25 AEs). For the MedDRA SOC of General disorders and administration site 
conditions, 631 AEs cumulatively were reported of which 225 were serious. 
Commonly reported terms (≥ 25) included Pyrexia (58 AEs), Oedema peripheral (57 AEs), Malaise (44 
AEs), Pain (38 AEs), Asthenia and Chills (33 AEs for each), Drug ineffective (31 AEs), andDeath (26 AEs). 
For the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC, 343 AEs were reported cumulatively, 99 of 
which were serious; the most commonly reported AEs were Drug dose omission (121 AEs), followed by 
Gastrointestinal stoma complication (74 AEs). In the MedDRA SOC of Infections and infestations, 254 AEs 
were reported cumulatively, 177 of which were serious. The most commonly reported terms (≥15) were 
Device-related infection (59 AEs), followed by Pneumonia (20 AEs), Sepsis (19 AEs), Nasopharyngitis (17 
AEs), and Urinary tract infection (16 AEs). 
 The summary of safety concerns for the product as per the categorization of important identified risks, 
important potential risks, and important missing information is included in the EU-RMP. Of note, for the 
missing information category of “Lack of experience in the paediatric population”, there had been no 
reports of AEs for patients aged ≤ 18 in the interval period of 01 Mar 2015 through 30 Aug 2015, 
inclusive, as reported in PSUR 6. Lastly, as summarized in PSUR 6, there had been no change in the risk 
profile for the product’s approved treatment indications during the report interval. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety information in the paediatric population of 42 paediatric patients aged 1-14 years were collected 
for 16 weeks (12 weeks on study treatment and 4 weeks follow-up). Vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea 
were those preferred terms most frequently reported. Fatigue (very common), painful defaecation (very 
common), and dizziness (common) were reported at a higher frequency in paediatric subjects when 
compared to adults and this is mentioned in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber.  
The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate and no patients discontinued the study due to adverse 
events. Also, no deaths occurred during the study. The safety database in children is considered limited 
and this is outlined in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/531666/2016 
Page 41/62 
 
 
  
  
As mentioned in the efficacy discussion disease characteristics in adults and children are similar and the 
same AE pattern was observed in the paediatric population. There were no new safety signals in the 
paediatric population as compared with the adult population in previous trials. Events of special interest 
seen in the adult population, namely biliary complications and colonic polyp formation, were not seen in 
the paediatric study population. In study TED-C13-003 all patients with positive results in the fecal occult 
blood testing at the Screening visist and at week 12 were to undergo confirmatory colonoscopy / 
sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for GI polyps or other sources of GI blood loss. Additionally, patients age 12 
and older underwent a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy at screening (or within 1 year prior to Visit 1). The 
frequency of colorectal polyps is very low in paediatric patients, especially in younger children and due to 
the short-term treatment with teduglutide in this study, it was not justified to perform colonoscopies in 
children, unless the patient had a positive fecal occult blood test. In view of this safety concern from the 
adult population recommendation for follow up (test for faecal occult blood and colonoscopies) in children 
was included for the prescriber in section 4.4 in the SmPC. 
Also the study duration was too short to show relevant long term effects particularly on developmental 
parameters within the relatively large age range of children included in the studyAn  abrupt withdrawal of 
parenteral nutrition and fluids due to the effects of teduglutide could lead to a delay in weight gain, 
growth and maturation in these children. The SmPC addresses the risk with a precautionary statement on 
the management of fluids during treatment with Revestive. However further data on long term effects, 
including developmental parameters will be generated post authorisation with studies TED-C14-006 and 
the SBS registry as described in the RMP. The studies will also contribute to further characterise the 
overall safety profile of Revestive in the authorized dose which is acceptable from a safety perspective. 
An apparently higher incidence of TEAEs was reported in the 0.05 mg/kg group. However, the Applicant 
has been able to show that the difference was mainly driven by AEs reporting in 3 patients from the same 
centre. When excluding these three patients, a comparable safety profile between the 0.025 mg/kg and 
the 0.05 mg/kg group is observed. The three patients were all 100% weaned off PN/IV and the main AEs 
were vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue and headache. These events are well-known and reflected in the 
SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database in children is considered limited both in terms of short and long term exposure and 
this is outlined in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber. Adequate precautionary statements are 
included for re-evaluation of the treatment effect and fluid status following parenteral support reduction 
by the expert prescriber. 
Further data on long term effects, including developmental parameters will be generated post 
authorisation with studies TED-C14-006 and the SBS registry as described in the RMP. The studies will 
also contribute to further characterise the overall safety profile of Revestive in the authorized dose which 
is acceptable for marketing authorisation. 
During the procedure the applicant has taken the opportunity to amend the due dates for the SBS 
registry outlined in Annex II of the marketing authorization. The CHMP considered this amendment 
acceptable as the first patient was enrolled in the study a year later than expected. 
2.4.3.  PSUR cycle  
Due to the extension of indication to include the paediatric population, the PSUR cycle for the medicinal 
product should continue to follow a half-yearly cycle until otherwise  set out in the list of Union reference 
dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The next data lock point will be 06-11-2015.

2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.3 is acceptable. The joint assessment

clinical studies. In case of gallbladder or 
bile duct-related symptoms, the need for 
continued REVESTIVE treatment should be 
reassessed.  
Monitoring of small bowel, gallbladder

Measures 
should be monitored with regard to fluid 
overload, especially during initiation of 
therapy. Patients should be advised to 
contact their physician in case of sudden 
weight gain, swollen ankles and/or 
dyspnoea. In general, fluid overload can 
be prevented by appropriate and timely 
assessment of parenteral nutrition needs. 
This assessment should be conducted 
more frequently within the first months of 
treatment. In case of a significant 
deterioration of the cardiovascular 
disease, the need for continued REVESTIVE 
treatment should be reassessed. 
Management of fluids during treatment 
with Revestive 
In patients receiving Revestive, 
parenteral support should be reduced 
carefully and should not be discontinued 
abruptly. The subject’s fluid status should 
be evaluated following parenteral support 
reduction and corresponding adjustment 
performed, as needed. 
Gastrointestinal stenosis and 
obstruction 
Per the current SmPC: 
Intestinal obstruction 
None. 
Cases of intestinal obstruction have been 
reported in clinical studies. In case of 
recurrent intestinal obstructions, the need 
for continued REVESTIVE treatment should 
be reassessed. 
Monitoring of small bowel, gallbladder 
and bile ducts, and pancreas 
SBS patients are to be kept under close 
surveillance according to clinical 
treatment guidelines. This usually 
includes the monitoring of small bowel

Intestinal obstruction is a common 
undesirable effect.  
Gastrointestinal Stoma 
Complications 
Per the current SmPC: 
None. 
GI stoma complication is an undesirable 
effect. GI stoma complication (swelling of 
the stoma and associated complications) 
is considered to be rather a sign of 
efficacy than an adverse reaction. 
Growth of pre-existing polyps

Measures 
A colonoscopy with removal of polyps 
should be performed at the time of 
starting treatment with REVESTIVE. Once 
yearly follow-up colonoscopies (or 
alternate imaging) are recommended 
during the first 2 years of REVESTIVE 
treatment. Subsequent colonoscopies are 
recommended at a minimum of 5-year 
intervals. An individual assessment 
whether increased frequency of 
surveillance is necessary should be 
performed based on the patient 
characteristics (e.g. age, underlying 
disease). If a polyp is found, adherence to 
current polyp follow-up guidelines is 
recommended. In case of malignancy, 
REVESTIVE therapy should be discontinued.  
Gastrointestinal neoplasia including 
hepatobiliary tract 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, benign 
tumours were found in the small bowel 
and the extrahepatic bile ducts. These 
observations were not confirmed in 
clinical studies of more than 1-year 
duration. If a neoplasia is detected, it 
should be removed. In case of 
malignancy, Revestive treatment should 
be discontinued 
Paediatric population 
Colorectal polyps/Neoplasia 
Prior to initiating treatment with 
Revestive, faecal occult blood testing 
should be performed in all children. 
Subsequent testing should be conducted 
annually in children while they are 
receiving Revestive. 
Prior to initiating treatment with 
Revestive, children 12 years of age and 
older should have undergone a 
colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, unless one 
has been done within the past year.. 
Children under 12 years of age should 
also have the procedure if they have 
unexplained blood in their stool. 
Colonoscopy is recommended for all 
children after one year of treatment, and 
at least every 5 years thereafter of 
continuous treatment with Revestive. 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Based on the concerns derived from 
nonclinical studies and the proposed 
mechanism of action with the trophic 
effects on intestinal mucosa, there appear 
to be a risk for the promotion of small 
intestinal and/or colonic neoplasia. The 
clinical studies conducted could neither 
exclude nor confirm such an increased

Per the current SmPC: 
Immunogenicity 
None. 
Consistent with the potentially 
immunogenic properties of medicinal 
products containing peptides, 
administration of REVESTIVE may 
potentially trigger the development of 
antibodies. In Phase 3 studies with SBS, 
patients who received REVESTIVE for 
≥ 2 years, 39% of patients developed 
anti-teduglutide antibodies and 21% of 
patients developed antibodies against ECP 
(residual host cell protein from the 
manufacture). The antibody formation 
has not been associated with clinically 
relevant safety findings, reduced efficacy 
or changed PK of REVESTIVE.

Per the current SmPC: 
Concomitant medication 
Patients receiving oral concomitant 
medicinal products requiring titration or 
with a narrow therapeutic index should be 
monitored closely due to potential 
increased absorption. 
Interaction with other medicinal products 
and other forms of interaction 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies 
have been performed. An in vitro study 
indicates that teduglutide does not inhibit 
CYP450 drug metabolising enzymes. 
Based upon the PD effect of teduglutide, 
there is a potential for increased 
absorption of concomitant medicinal 
products. 
Increased C-Reactive Protein 
Per the current SmPC: 
None. 
C-reactive protein increased 
CRP increased is listed as a common 
undesirable effect under Investigations. 
Modest increases of CRP of approximately 
25 mg/L have been observed within the 
first 7 days of REVESTIVE treatment, which 
decreased continuously under ongoing 
daily injections. After 24 weeks of 
REVESTIVE treatment, subjects showed 
small overall increase in CRP of 
approximately 1.5 mg/L on average. 
These changes were neither associated 
with any changes in other laboratory 
parameters nor with any reported clinical 
symptoms. There were no clinically 
relevant mean increases of CRP from 
baseline following long-term treatment 
with REVESTIVE for up to 30 months.

Injection site reactions occurred in 21% 
of SBS patients treated with REVESTIVE. 
The reactions appeared to be dose 
dependent and occurred with similar 
frequency in patients given the 
recommended dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day 
REVESTIVE and in subjects given placebo 
(injection site reactions were experienced 
by 12% of the placebo-treated subjects, 
by 13% of the patients who received 0.05 
mg/kg/day REVESTIVE and by 41% of the 
subjects who received 0.10 mg/kg/day 
REVESTIVE). The reactions included 
injection site erythema, injection site 
haematoma and injection site pain. 
Per the current SmPC:

Adults  
The recommended dose of REVESTIVE is 
0.05 mg/kg body weight once daily. A 
table with the injection volume per body 
weight is provided. Due to the 
heterogeneity of the SBS population, a 
carefully monitored down-titration of the 
daily dose may be considered for some 
patients to optimise tolerability of the 
treatment. If a dose is missed, that dose 
should be taken as soon as possible on 
that day.  
Paediatric population (≥1 year) 
The recommended dose of Revestive in 
children and adolescents (aged 1 to 
17 years) is the same as for adults 
(0.05 mg/kg body weight once daily). 
Overdose  
The maximum dose of teduglutide studied 
during clinical development was 
86 mg/day for 8 days. No unexpected 
systemic adverse reactions were seen. In 
the event of an overdose, the patient 
should be carefully monitored by the 
medical professional. 
Determination of the number of vials 
needed for administration of one dose 
must be based on the individual patient’s 
weight and the recommended dose of 
0.05 mg/kg/day. The physician should at 
each visit weigh the patient, determine 
the daily dose to be administered until 
next visit and inform the patient 
accordingly. 
Tables with the injection volumes based 
on the recommended dose per body 
weight for both adults and paediatric 
patients are provided in section 4.2 of the

harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use 
of REVESTIVE during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether teduglutide is 
excreted in human milk. In rats, mean 
teduglutide concentration in milk was less 
than 3% of the maternal plasma 
concentration following a single SC 
injection of 25 mg/kg. A risk to the

2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
The content of the current PL has been fully tested and assessed for readability. 
The proposed revisions to the PL are minor: the proposed dose for paediatrics is the same as 
the recommended dose in adults and the side effect profile is similar to that seen in adults. 
•  Many paediatric patients administering Revestive are likely to be assisted by carers/parents 
and the PL has already been tested in this population. 
2.6.2.  Paediatric data 
The CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Plan P/0245/2015  and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Overall, 12 weeks teduglutide treatment was associated with a reduction in parenteral nutrition PN/IV 
support in terms of volume and calories in paediatric patients aged 1-14 years, when compared with the 
group of children treated with standard of care. Three different dose levels were evaluated: 0.0125, 
0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg. The adult dose of 0.05 mg/kg was also chosen for the paediatric population. The 
number of patients achieving a 10% and 20% reduction in PN/IV volume and calories use were higher in 
the 0.025 mg/kg (71%) and 0.05 mg/kg (53%) dose groups compared with the lowest dose of 0.0125 
mg/kg (12.5%) and the standard of care group (0%). The absolute and percent changes in PN/IV volume 
and calories were about 2.7 L/week and 1800 kcal/week, translating into a percent change of about 37% 
in the two highest dose groups. Furthermore days of PN/IV usage was estimated to be reduced by 1.3 
days per week in the 0.05 mg/kg dose group and 0.69 days per week in the 0.025 mg/kg group. Four 
patients were completely weaned off at 12 weeks. These subjects included 3 of 15 (20.0%) subjects in 
the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort and 1 of 14 (7.1%) subjects in the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort. 
The clinical manifestation of the disease in adults and children are similar and is due to diminished 
absorption, which leads to malabsorption and diarrhoea, leading to dehydration and malnutrition, 
abdominal pain, fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Also the management and complications of SBS are 
similar between adults and children. Based on the disease characteristics, course of disease, the 
preclinical and clinical data from the adult population, there is sufficient data to conclude that the data 
observed in adults can be used to draw conclusions on efficacy in the paediatric population. 
In the adult studies, a 20% reduction in the PN/IV support is considered clinically relevant, and a superior 
effect of teduglutide was seen already after 8-12 weeks. The effect increased over time with more than 
70% of patients reaching a 20% reduction in PN/IV volume at 6 months. Similar results after 12 weeks 
were seen for the doses 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg in the paediatric population, supporting that also the 
paediatric population accordingly benefits in the long term from teduglutide treatment. Furthermore, one 
day off PN/IV support per week is also considered clinically relevant for paediatric patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The study duration was short (3 months only) and the numbers of included patients was small, however 
the durability and further course of the beneficial effects of teduglutide in paediatric patients comprised 
by the indication can be reasonably assumed from the effect seen in adults based on the totality of data 
in this rare disease.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea) were most frequently reported, followed by 
general disorders and administration site conditions, and infections and infestations. While these events 
are important, their risk is well known and described in the RMP. Fatigue (very common), painful 
defaecation (very common), and dizziness (common) were reported at a higher frequency in paediatric 
subjects when compared to adults and this is mentioned in the SmPC for the attention of the prescriber. 
There were no new safety signals in the paediatric population as compared with the adult population in 
previous trials. Events of special interest seen in the adult population, namely biliary complications and 
colonic polyp formation, were not seen in the paediatric study population but due to the limited safety 
database precautionary statements were included in 4.4 of the SmPC for their screening in the paediatric 
population namely regular testing of faecal occult blood and colonoscopy / sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for 
GI polys or other sources of occult blood.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Adverse events were only evaluated for 16 weeks, hence no long-term safety data for the paediatric 
population was provided.  Due to the low number of subjects included into the trial and the restricted 
observation period it is possible that events of clinical concern have not been observed within the study 
and long term safety in the paediatric population has been added as missing information to the RMP. No 
differences were found in the pivotal study for the “developmental” parameters body weight, height, and 
height-Z-scores, with a small numerical disadvantage for the higher dosing groups. 
Theoretically a to abrupt withdrawal of parenteral nutrition and fluids due to the effects of teduglutide 
could lead to a delay in weight gain, growth and maturation in these children. The SmPC addresses the 
risk with a precautionary statement on the management of fluids during treatment with Revestive. 
However further data on long term unfavourable effects, including developmental parameters will be 
generated post authorisation with studies TED-C14-006 and its long term extension as described in the 
RMP.  
Furthermore it is noted that paediatric patients are  to be enrolled in the already existing SBS registry 
which was established at the time of the initial marketing authorisation as outlined in Annex II and 
described in the RMP. These studies will also contribute to the further characterisation of the overall 
safety profile of Revestive in the authorized dose in this patient population.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Short bowel syndrome is a state of intestinal failure following major intestinal resection. Currently limited 
treatment options are available restricted to pharmacological therapy aiming at reduction of secretory 
losses and parenteral nutrition (PN: fluid/energy). PN is associated with a significant impact on quality of 
life in addition to risk of serious complications (e.g. central catheter sepsis and thrombosis, complications 
related to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, significant liver toxicity and biliary disease). 
For patients with short-bowel-syndrome (SBS), a reduction in PN/IV support is valuable along with an 
increase in enteral intake leading to an improved quality of life particularly following a reduction in 
numbers of days on PN/IV usage per week and reducing the complications related to parenteral nutrition. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of teduglutide for the treatment of paediatric patients aged one year and above 
with SBS with PN need is positive.   
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Long term PN/IV support is associated with serious complications, such as infections and liver damage. 
The risk for these effects increases over time with longer duration of PN/IV support. Achievement of 
enteral autonomy avoids the significant morbidity associated with long-term dependence on PN and is 
therefore the primary aim of modern management of intestinal failure. 
The applicant could show clinical relevant effects in paediatric patients aged one year and above on the 
reduction in PN/IV volume and calories as well as on the potentially clinically most relevant parameters, 
the complete weaning from PN need. In adult studies the effect on reduction in PN/IV volume increased 
even further at 6 months. The applicant provided convincing arguments that the efficacy data observed in 
adults can be used to support to this paediatric indication. 
The same AE pattern was observed in the paediatric population. Gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, 
nausea and diarrhoea) were most frequently reported, followed by general disorders and administration 
site conditions, and infections and infestations. While these events are important, their risk is well known 
and described in the RMP. Also monitoring of potential colonic polyp formation and careful fluid 
management are addressed in the product information and their risk can be considered balanced. No 
differences were found in the pivotal study for developmental parameters such as body weight, height,

and height-Z-scores. However, due to the low number of subjects included into the trial and the restricted 
observation period long term safety in the paediatric population will be carried out with in the already 
existing NIS as well as with study TED-C14-006 as described in the RMP. These studies will also 
contribute to the further characterisation of the overall safety profile of Revestive in the authorized dose 
in this patient population.

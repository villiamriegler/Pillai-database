1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted on 26 July 2022 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Litfulo, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 October 2021. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Litfulo is indicated for the treatment of severe 
alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older (see section 5.1). 
1.2.  Legal basis and dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0147/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0147/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance ritlecitinib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

Mario Miguel Rosa, Karl-Heinz 
Huemer 
The scientific advice pertained to the following non-clinical and clinical aspects: 
Initial SA EMEA/H/SA/3875/1/2018/HTA/III: 
•  Non-clinical: Issues raised concerned whether the provided, ongoing, and planned nonclinical 
toxicity studies with PF-06651600 may be sufficient for MAA purposes. Specifically, whether the 
collective nonclinical toxicity package supports clinical doses up to 200 mg QD for 16 weeks and 
100 mg QD for chronic dosing. 
•  Clinical: The initial advice concerned the clinical pharmacology package, QT analyses ,medical 
need and  inclusion criteria, placebo comparator, the selected dose(s) and dose regimen(s) to be 
evaluated, primary endpoint, key secondary endpoint, handling of emergence or re-emergence of 
androgenetic (male or female pattern) baldness, appropriate time-point to demonstrate efficacy, 
the proposed numeric rating scales (below) to assess the treatment effect on eyebrows and 
eyelashes, adequacy of the withdrawal-retreatment design of the ongoing Phase 2a study 
(B7931005) with extension to demonstrate the need for continuous treatment, adequacy of the 
proposed clinical data support the proposed posology statement, the proposed sample size for the 
Phase 2b/3 study, the key data to be collected at baseline for the Phase 2b/3, safety assessments 
and safety monitoring plans. Acceptability that an initial submission package for PF-06651600, 
based on 2 studies (the ongoing Phase 2a proof-of-concept study, followed by the proposed 
pivotal Phase 2b/3 dose ranging study), could be sufficient to support an initial conditional 
approval for AA with 50% or greater scalp hair loss, provided the evidence of positive benefit:risk 
profile was clear and compelling. Acceptability of the projected safety databases. Appropriateness 
of inclusion of adolescents. Whether a single Phase 3B study coupled with results from the LTE 
study and post-approval RWE is adequate to support full authorisation. Patient reported outcomes 
(PROs). 
Follow-up (FU) advice EMEA/H/SA/3875/1/FU/1/2019/III: 
• 
The clinical relevance of the treatment-related axonal dystrophy observed in dogs.  Clarification in 
how far the relative CNS immaturity in humans, especially with regards to continued myelination 
and synaptogenesis, resembles the one in the dog during adolescence. The proposed approach for 
additional characterisation of the clinical relevance of the finding of axonal dystrophy observed in 
the 9-month toxicity studies in dogs with PF-06651600 adequately addresses the Agency’s 
request for clinical risk characterisation. Agreement that the totality of evidence from the PF-
06651600 programme (including the nonclinical data, the clinical safety data from studies 
B7981015 and B7981032, and data from the ex-EU Study B7981037), that the clinical relevance 
of the nonclinical finding of axonal dystrophy in dogs will be adequately characterised to support a 
future MAA filing for adolescents. Agreement that that based on the totality of evidence from the 
PF-06651600 programme (including adolescents), additional clinical risk characterisation in the 
Assessment report

younger paediatric subjects (from 6 to <12 years of age) is not warranted.  
FU advice EMEA/H/SA/3875/1/FU/2/2020/II: 
•  Revision of the primary endpoint of Study B7981015 to the proportion of patients achieving 
SALT ≤20 at Week 24. Adequacy of the proposed safety data package to support initial MAA 
review. Discussion of an ‘extrapolation study’ to support adolescent subjects in the EU PIP (in 
addition to all the studies that include [ex-EU] adolescent subjects). Modifications of the 
design of Study B7981027 including inclusion of a lower dose and a mandatory psychological 
counselling run-in period in the paediatric Study B7981027.

a marketing authorisation to Litfulo on  
Furthermore, the CHMP adopted a report on New Active Substance 
20 July 2023 
(NAS) status of the active substance contained in the medicinal product 
(see Appendix on NAS) 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication was as follows:  
Litfulo is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older (see section 5.1). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Studies on the prevalence of alopecia areata (AA) are limited and estimates vary considerably. A meta-
analysis including articles published up to 2018 calculated the overall pooled incidence (95%CI) of AA 
in Europe as 4.9% (2.4% -8.3%) and the pooled prevalence (95%CI) of AA was estimated as 0.58% 
(0.49% - 0.66%); (Lee 2020). 
The onset of AA can occur at any age; however, 82.6% to 88.0% of patients develop the condition 
before the age of 40 years and 40.2% by the age of 20 years, with a mean age of onset between 25 
and 36 years (Villasante 2015). In a UK population, the annual incidence of AA peaked at 5.1 per 
10,000 (males) and 4.3 per 10,000 (females) in patients aged 25-29 years and subsequently 
decreased with age (Harries, 2022). It is uncertain whether there is a gender predominance in patients 
with AA (Harries, 2022). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
AA is an autoimmune T-cell disease that causes non-scarring hair loss, which may be chronic with 
unpredictable relapses, affecting all ages, races, and genders. The complex pathophysiology of AA is 
still not completely understood. CD8+ T cells, NK cells and mast cells are likely involved in the 
pathogenesis of AA and their development and function are known to be regulated by both JAK3 and 
TEC kinases (such as ITK). Mouse models have shown that IL
2, and IL
15 play a role in the initiation 
of auto
reactive CD8+ cells (Dai 2021; Xing 2014). Also, data from patients with AA demonstrated that

‑
15 plays a critical role in the pathogenic pathways of AA (Suarez-Farinas 2015).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The three main variants of AA are patchy AA (localised hairless areas), alopecia totalis (AT) (entire 
scalp affected), and alopecia universalis (AU) (affecting all body surface area). Nearly all AA patients 
experience more than one episode of scalp hair loss, and 14-25% progress to AT or AU (Messenger 
2012). The onset of AA can occur at any age. Disease duration >1 year and extensive hair loss (> 50% 
scalp involvement) are predictors of poorer prognosis, with <17% of AT and AU patients reaching

remission with fully regrown lost hair (Messenger 2012; Pratt 2017; Jang 2017; Tosti 2006). A study 
assessing the long-term course of AA across age groups reported that the proportion of patients with 
relapses after diagnosis was high overall (52%, 44% and 30% in childhood-onset, adult-onset and 
late-onset, respectively); however, relapses declined over time, with the majority (79%) occurring 
within the first 4 years after initial diagnosis (Lyakhovitsky 2019). 
Hair loss is emotionally challenging and results in higher incidences of psychosocial impacts in patients 
with AA compared to healthy people, including detrimental effects on emotional wellbeing, self-esteem, 
social interactions, and health-related quality of life. 
Treatment guidelines vary but generally distinguish between “acute” or “active” versus “chronic” AA 
(Messenger 2012; Meah 2020; Rossi 2019). While some treatment guidelines and consensus 
statements define AA involving ≥50% scalp hair loss as "extensive" or "severe" AA, there is no agreed 
upon definition of severity. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Baricitinib (a selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2) was centrally approved in the EU on 19 May 2022 for 
the treatment of severe AA in adults. No other products are centrally approved for the treatment of AA. 
However, some authorised medications are available in individual member states (e.g., 
methylprednisolone and triamcinolone intra-lesion injections are approved for AA indication in NL). 
Current guidelines advise on topical (corticosteroids and minoxidil) or systemic therapies 
(corticosteroids, corticosteroid-sparing agents such as cyclosporin and methotrexate, and biological 
such as ustekinumab) (European Dermatology Forum (EDF): Evidence-based (S3) guideline for the 
treatment of androgenetic alopecia in women and men, 2017; British Association of Dermatologists 
(BAD): Guidelines for the management of alopecia areata, 2012). However, some of those treatments 
are used off-label.  
2.2.  About the product 
Ritlecitinib is an oral covalent irreversible inhibitor of the 5 TEC family kinases (BMX, BTK, ITK, TEC, 
TXK) and JAK3. The covalent mechanism of inhibition confers high selectivity over the remaining three 
JAK isoforms (JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2) and the broader kinome. Ritlecitinib is characterised by its lack of 
activity against JAK1 and JAK2 leading to a narrower spectrum of cytokine inhibition, inhibiting only 
the 6 γ-common cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. Consequently, in human whole 
blood, ritlecitinib inhibits signalling of the common-γ chain receptors but does not inhibit signalling of 
cytokines that are JAK3 independent such as the JAK1 dependent cytokines (including type 1 & 2 
interferons, the IL-6 family of cytokines, the IL-10 family of cytokines). Ritlecitinib does not inhibit the 
JAK2-dependent hematopoietic factors such as EPO and TPO. Ritlecitinib additionally inhibits the TEC 
family of kinases leading to the inhibition of cytolytic functions in CD8+ T cells and NK cells (Telliez 
2016; Xu 2019). Thus, ritlecitinib aims to inhibit the signalling of JAK3-dependent cytokines and TEC 
family-dependent immune receptors that are considered to contribute to the pathophysiology of AA.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The application was submitted under the legal basis 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC which corresponds to 
a complete and independent application. The applicant received EMA scientific advice on the clinical 
development programme of ritlecitinib in the treatment of AA (see section 1.5. ‘Scientific advice’).

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of ritlecitinib tosylate is 1-{(2S,5R)-2-Methyl-5-[(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-
yl)amino]piperidin-1-yl}prop-2-en-1-one 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonic acid corresponding to the 
molecular formula C22H27N5O4S. It has a relative molecular weight of 457.55 Daltons and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The structure has two chiral centres, giving four possible diastereomeric isomers. The chiral pure 
(2S,5R) isomer is used in the finished product. The diastereomeric purity is introduced with one of the 
starting materials and is not changed during the manufacturing process. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. Properties of the active substance were measured by infrared (IR) 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-Ray 
Diffraction, Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy.

The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white to pale pink solid. Ritlecitinib tosylate is 
classified as a BCS class III active substance (high solubility and low permeability). It exists in a single 
crystal form (Form 1). This form is physically and chemically stable under normal manufacturing and 
storage conditions as well as under accelerated stability conditions. No other polymorphs or hydrated 
forms have been observed during development or in stability studies.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis of ritlecitinib tosylate consists of 4 synthetic steps using three well-defined, custom-
synthesised starting materials with acceptable specifications, one salt formation step, and one 
recrystallisation step. In the first three steps, the key structural features are built up. The final steps 
include the tosylate salt formation and recrystallisation. Part of the last step is a milling process, in 
which the particle size distribution of the active substance is controlled. 
The manufacturing process is sufficiently described. The control strategy (including specification of 
starting materials and intermediates, in-process controls and monitoring of critical process parameters) 
is provided in section 3.2.S.2.6. 
• 
The choice of the starting materials is adequately justified by the applicant in line with ICH 
Q11. As mentioned above, the enantiomeric purity is adequately controlled in one of the 
starting materials. Batch data of the active substance manufactured from each source of 
starting materials has been provided to demonstrate quality equivalence between different 
sources of starting materials.  
•  A list of raw materials was provided with specifications. No class 1 solvents are used. Residual 
benzene in ethanol and toluene is controlled by specification in these solvents.  
• 
• 
Two intermediates are identified . The proposed specifications for both intermediates are 
acceptable. Structural characterisation of intermediates was provided by the applicant. 
Four critical parameters were specified in the development , and in-process controls are 
established. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. A structural analysis and a schematic overview of the origin, 
fate and purge of the specified organic impurities is included in the dossier.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The development of the manufacturing procedure is described in detail.  
The applicant established critical quality attributes (CQAs), which include specified organic impurities 
(based on batch history and impurities identified in the later steps), particle size distribution (PSD), 
and residual solvents. The in-process controls and manufacturing controls to control the CQAs have 
been described. Following commercial route selection and design, ritlecitinib tosylate development was 
focused on building an understanding of the functional relationships between material attributes, 
process parameters, and the critical quality attributes (CQAs). A structured quality risk management 
approach was employed to identify potential critical process parameters and critical material attributes 
based on risk of impact to the ritlecitinib tosylate CQAs.  The reaction parameters of each step were 
investigated using risk assessment, univariate and DoE studies. Based on this, the control strategy was 
established. Based on these studies, design spaces have been proposed for several steps of the

manufacturing process, and provided the required data from DoE studies to justify the proposed 
operating ranges.  
The impact of scale and equipment dependent parameters has been assessed for all experiments, 
including impact of several parameters on scale-up. In addition to the scale and equipment 
understanding, a variety of pilot and commercial scale batches of each step of the manufacturing 
process have been performed during development. These batches serve as confirmation of the scale 
and equipment understanding and support the validity of the design spaces at commercial scale. The 
available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed design spaces. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified. It has been demonstrated that the change(s) did not have a significant impact on 
the quality of the product. 
Ritlecitinib tosylate is packaged in two sealed, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) anti-static liners. The 
bagged material is then inserted into a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum. The LDPE anti-static 
liner is suitable for pharmaceutical or “in contact with food” use and comply with EU regulation No. 
10/2011. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification  includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (IR), chiral 
identification (LC), assay (LC), impurities (LC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), 
counter ion, residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The active substance specification is based on the active substance CQAs. The CQAs identified include 
organic impurities, PSD, and residual solvents.  
Identification is performed with two tests, IR by comparing with a reference standard and LC to 
establish the chiral identity by comparing with a reference standard. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate limits have been set. 
The proposed acceptance criterion for particle size distribution is solely based on finished product 
manufacturability. Impact of the particle size on finished product bioavailability and dissolution is 
considered negligible because of the high solubility of the active substance. 
The applicant provided rationales for omitting tests for the opposite enantiomer of ritlecitinib, 
polymorphic form, benzene, elemental impurities, BHT, microbial enumeration, and class 1-3 
impurities from the active substance specification; these are acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards of ritlecitinib tosylate Form 1 and ritlecitinib to show that the correct structure is 
present, chromatography to establish assay and impurity profile, x-ray diffraction to establish crystal 
form and other tests to define its purity has been presented. Reference standards for related 
substances and the counter ion, and for chiral identity testing have also been described. 
Batch analysis data of 41 batches produced during development using the synthetic route in use at the 
time, and 18 pilot scale batches and 4 commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured

with the synthetic route proposed for commercial manufacture are provided. The results are within the 
specification limits and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The primary stability programme consists of a formal programme comprising three batches 
manufactured at the development site using the commercial process without an auxiliary material to 
limit impurity formation at commercial scale. Thirty months stability data at long term conditions (25ºC 
/ 60% RH) and six months at accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) are provided.  
A supplementary registration stability programme in which one batch manufactured at the 
development site using the commercial process including an additional auxiliary material at commercial 
scale  is provided. Data through twenty-four months at 25°C / 60% RH and six months at the 
accelerated condition of 40°C / 75% RH is included. As indicated above, an auxiliary material was 
added to the process to mitigate impurity formation. This change was made to the process after the 
manufacture of the primary stability active substance lots. Data presented showed that the material 
generated using the final commercial manufacturing route, in which the auxiliary material is added, is 
chemically equivalent to that produced when the auxiliary material is not present and show the same 
stability behaviour. 
In addition, data from the commercial stability programme on three batches manufactured at the site 
proposed for commercial manufacture at commercial scale is available. Twelve months stability data at 
25°C / 60% RH and six months at the accelerated condition of 40°C / 75% RH are provided. 
All batches were stored in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
For the primary stability programme 30 months data are completed of 3 pilot scale batches without the 
additional auxiliary material, and for the supplementary stability programme 24 months data are 
completed of 1 batch with the additional auxiliary material, stored under long term conditions (25ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines.  
The following parameters were investigated: appearance, assay, degradation products, API Polymer, 
chiral purity, water content, particle size, polymorph form and microbiological quality.  
The analytical procedures used in the primary and supplementary stability programs are the same as 
the release procedures, with the exception of chiral purity, solid form and microbial quality. The 
additional analytical procedures have been described. 
For all the data provided, no significant upward or downward trend was observed for all parameters 
measured including assay and related substances. No differences in stability are observed between the 
primary and supplementary stability studies.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch from the primary 
stability study. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, achiral purity, polymer impurity, water 
content, solid form and chiral purity. No degradation was observed. 
Therefore, it is accepted that no light restriction for storage of the active substance is applied. 
Samples of ritlecitinib tosylate active substance were subjected to forced degradation conditions 
(thermal, thermal/humidity; acid; base; light exposure; heat; and oxidation) to confirm the suitability 
of the assay and purity procedure and to identify potential primary degradation products. The only 
forced conditions that caused any degradation to occur were basic conditions in solution and high

temperature/high humidity in the solid state. The study showed that the assay/purity procedure 
proposed for commercial production is specific, selective, and stability-indicating.  
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitments are accepted. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Litfulo is presented as immediate release (IR) hypromellose (HPMC) opaque hard capsules containing 
50 mg of ritlecitinib (as tosylate). The capsules are size #3 (approximately 16 mm in length x 6 mm 
width), with a yellow body and blue cap. The body is printed with “RCB 50” and the cap is printed with 
“Pfizer” in black.  
The development was also performed with 30 mg and 100 mg capsules manufactured from a common 
blend, as well as other clinical development formulations, including extemporaneously prepared (EP) 
oral solutions, non-film coated immediate release (IR) tablet for oral administration and a solution for 
intravenous administration. Only the 50 mg capsule strength is proposed for commercialisation.  
The formulation and process development of ritlecitinib capsules focused on the quality attributes 
defined in the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) . 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) has been established as immediate release dosage form 
containing ritlecitinib capsules, that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards for CQAs 
appearance, identity, assay, impurities, uniformity of dosage units, water activity, dissolution and 
microbial limits. 
An enhanced development programme was executed in accordance with ICH Q8(R2). A combination of 
risk-based assessments, small-scale multivariate studies and manufacturing experience at the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site has resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the 
formulation and process conditions and their impact on the quality attributes of the finished product. 
Attributes and parameters have been categorised as either critical or non-critical, based on their 
impact on product quality. The proposed commercial ritlecitinib finished product manufacturing process 
is supported by a control strategy that assures each quality attribute meets the acceptance criteria 
required to deliver a finished product with the desired efficacy, safety and quality. 
The active substance is the ritlecitinib tosylate salt, crystalline Form 1. The highest ritlecitinib clinical 
dose (200 mg) assessed in the pivotal clinical study is soluble over the entire physiological pH range. 
The acceptance criterion for active substance particle size distribution was developed considering the 
impact on dissolution, bio performance and manufacturability (blend and content uniformity) of the 
finished product.  
All the excipients used in the proposed commercial formulation are globally acceptable and are present 
at pharmaceutically precedented levels. All excipients quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards, 
except yellow iron oxide (E172) and Brilliant blue FCF – FD&C Blue 1 (E133), which comply with the 
specifications described in Regulation 231/2012. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. Functionality-related characteristics of the excipients are discussed acceptably. No additional 
tests are necessary in the specifications of the excipients, given the lack of criticality of the aspects on 
the quality of the finished product.

The proposed patient population includes paediatric patients (12 years of age and older). The applicant 
has provided a discussion on the suitability of the excipients for this patient group, as per CHMP 
guideline on Pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use. 
The 10 mg and 50 mg strengths of the ritlecitinib IR tablet were used to support the pivotal Phase 
2b/3 efficacy and safety study (B7981015) and long-term safety study (B7981032) as well as clinical 
pharmacology studies. The ritlecitinib IR tablets were unsuitable for commercial development due to 
instability of the formulation (shelf-life was less than 2 months when stored at 30°C / 65% in an open 
dish, likely caused by the degradation of the ritlecitinib tosylate, resulting in the formation of the less 
stable ritlecitinib free base) as well as the multiple units (up to 4 tablets) potentially required to 
support the proposed doses. 
A preliminary excipient screen was conducted using binary mixtures (1:1 ratio) of ritlecitinib tosylate 
and a range of common pharmaceutical excipients stored for one week at 70°C / 75% RH. The results 
indicated that the highest level of impurity formation occurred when ritlecitinib tosylate was mixed with 
excipients with the following attributes – microenvironment pH greater than the pH max of ritlecitinib 
tosylate (~4.0) and proton accepting capacity (i.e. croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate and 
magnesium stearate). Out of the filler excipients assessed microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and starch 
provided an environment that minimised the degradation of the ritlecitinib tosylate active substance. 
Microcrystalline cellulose and lactose were selected as the fillers based on prior experience. The 
concentration of crospovidone and glyceryl dibehenate was selected based on precedence in other solid 
dosage form products. Additionally, the results confirmed the suitability of crospovidone as the 
disintegrant and glyceryl dibehenate as the lubricant.  
Following the identification of excipients for the proposed commercial finished product, formulation 
understanding experiments were conducted and focused on assessing the impact of drug loading and 
active substance particle size on stability, manufacturability and dissolution on the finished product. 
Based on the data generated, a capsule formulation was nominated as the proposed commercial 
formulation. 
To bridge between the clinical tablets and the proposed commercial capsules, a relative bioavailability 
(rBA) study (B7981022) and a pivotal bioequivalence study (B7981029) were conducted. A biowaiver 
for the lower capsule strengths of 50 mg and 30 mg has been applied because the composition of the 
strengths is quantitatively proportional, (i.e. common blend and manufacturing process) between the 
three capsule strengths. The BE/PK similarity between products and strengths is supported by in vivo 
and in vitro evaluations. 
The bioequivalence study (B7981029) demonstrated that the clinical 50 mg tablet formulation used in 
the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study is equivalent to the intended 100 mg ‘commercial’ capsule formulation 
(not subject of the marketing authorisation application). Dissolution results of the 50 mg tablets and 
100 mg capsules used in the BE study have been provided, although the results could not be compared 
directly due to the difference in dissolution procedure set-up. However, as in vivo results prevail, this 
issue was not further pursued. 
A biowaiver for the lower strength of 50 mg capsules has been applied because the composition of the 
strengths is quantitatively proportional, (i.e. common blend and manufacturing process) between the 
30 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg capsule strengths. The same common blend (identical active and inactive 
ingredients) is used to fill the 30 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg ritlecitinib capsules. Following a Major 
Objection from the CHMP, dissolution testing of the 30 mg capsules, 50 mg capsules and 100 mg 
capsules in three different pH media (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8) using USP Apparatus II (paddle) at 
50 rpm with 500 ml of test medium, was performed and the profiles are compared. The actual 
numerical results have been provided and show that the dissolution profiles of the 100 mg vs 50 mg 
and 100 mg vs 30 mg are not similar in all pH media.  The profiles show that dissolution is rapid, with 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 19/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
all capsules reaching greater than 85% mean release by 30 minutes in all media. The applicant 
claimed that although the 100 mg capsule has a similar profile shape to the 30 mg and 50 mg 
capsules, it has a delayed start due to a slower capsule rupturing time (larger capsule shells take 
longer to rupture and release the active substance). F2 calculations cannot be performed due to 
high %RSD values at early time points, and F2-bootstrap results are below 50. 
The applicant argued that the observed delay in capsule rupturing in dissolution is justified by 
disintegration data (different strength ritlecitinib capsules disintegrate at different rates according to 
their capsule size, with the size #3 (50 mg) capsules disintegrating faster than the size #1 (100 mg) 
capsule) but that different capsule rupture times have no in vivo relevance, based on the results of the 
rBA study B7981022. In this study, a standard ritlecitinib 100 mg capsule with an over-encapsulated 
100 mg capsule (inside a size #0 capsule shell) showed the same relative bioavailability, despite the 
significant difference in capsule rupture times highlighted by the dissolution conditions. This was not 
considered a relevant study as it only justifies that a (100 mg) capsule with a slower dissolution/longer 
disintegration time had the same relative bioavailability as a regular (100 mg) capsule. It does not 
justify if a capsule with a faster disintegration also has the same bioavailability as a regular (100 mg) 
capsule.  A PBPK model was used to simulate BE trials comparing 100 mg capsules to 2 x 50 mg 
capsules. The PBPK model was developed using Simcyp® platform (version 22, release 1) with input 
parameters derived from in vitro and in vivo studies and was based upon physiologically based 
principles and justifiable assumptions. Model verification shows a good prediction, i.e. observed and 
predicted ratios for the capsule formulations fell within 1.08 – 1.20 for Cmax and 0.99 – 1.36 for AUC. 
Simulations showed that the 50 and 100 mg capsule can be considered bioequivalent. In addition, 
comparative performance of ritlecitinib 50 mg and 100 mg capsules was assessed using the TIM-1 
gastrointestinal simulator. Although the TIM-1 gastric dissolution profiles confirmed the faster 
dissolution from the 50 mg capsule, the cumulative bio-accessibility of 50 mg and 100 mg ritlecitinib 
capsule was comparable. 
Overall, pharmacokinetic data and simulations showed that, although the faster in vitro dissolution 
observed for the 50 mg capsule compared to the 100 mg capsule, the 50 and 100 mg capsule can be 
considered bioequivalent in vivo. Therefore, the bridge between the 50 mg clinical trial tablet and the 
50 mg capsule intended to be marketed is supported and the biowaiver is acceptable. 
The QC dissolution test conditions have been adequately justified. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method has been demonstrated.  
A discussion related to the observed discrepancies in dissolution profiles between six batches of the 
final finished product formulation was provided. The applicant justifies that the observed differences 
between the dissolution profiles are linked to the variability in the disintegration time of individual 
HPMC capsule shells (which causes high variability of dissolution results in the first sampling points) 
and not to the lack of reproducibility of the manufacturing process. Considering the manufacturing 
process (direct encapsulation) and that it has been demonstrated that the slower disintegration of 
capsule shells does not significantly impact the bioavailability of ritlecitinib (rBA study B7981022), the 
provided justification is considered acceptable.  
The proposed manufacturing process for ritlecitinib capsules is a conventional encapsulation process 
consisting of three main steps – blending, screening and encapsulation. Risk assessment was used to 
investigate the potential relationship between the processing step and quality attributes.  
The finished product manufacturer performed an intermediate holding time study on the final blend 
stage of ritlecitinib 50 mg capsules. The storage time was 63 days. The storage time confirms that a 
total production time of 60 days can be applied for ritlecitinib 50 mg capsules.

The primary packaging is a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a silica gel desiccant and 
polypropylene closure or OPA/Al/PVC/Al blisters. The packaging materials are commonly used for 
capsules. The specifications are acceptable as they contain tests for Identity, and IR spectra results 
have been provided. Certificates of Analysis / Conformity have been provided. The materials comply 
with EU directive EU 10/2011 and, where applicable, with Ph. Eur. requirements. This is considered 
acceptable. 
The amount of desiccant of 1 gram of silica gel has been justified. The effectiveness of the nature and 
the recorded quantity of desiccant has been discussed in relation to the maximum expected moisture 
retention during packing, the shelf life and normal use. The risk of accidental swallowing of the 
desiccant capsule is negligible, as it was demonstrated (with pictures) that the HDPE desiccant canister 
is sufficiently visually distinguishable from the product and bears a warning statement (‘DO NOT EAT’). 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at Pfizer Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH, Freiburg im 
Breisgau, Germany. The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: blending, screening, 
blending, encapsulation, weight sorting and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process.  
The typical drug product blend batch size manufactured at Pfizer Freiburg, Germany, is a defined batch 
size range. As the manufacturing process is considered a standard process, the concept of a batch size 
range is acceptable.  
Factorisation (i.e. adjusting the quantity of the active substance for potency) is applied, with cellulose 
microcrystalline as the excipient used to compensate. This is acceptable as cellulose microcrystalline is 
a filler of the capsule blend. The capsule shells are ready-made.  
The proposed in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and are 
acceptable.A validation protocol has been provided for the validation of the manufacturing process 
using three consecutive batches. The protocol is acceptable. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. As per the Guideline on manufacture of the finished dosage form, the applicant 
does not apply prolonged storage of the bulk capsules. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance (visual), identification  (LC, UV), assay (LC), degradation products (LC), 
dissolution (UV), uniformity of dosage units by weight variation (Ph. Eur.), water activity (Ph. Eur.), 
microbial limits (TAMC, TYMC and E. coli) (Ph. Eur.).  
The limit for assay at release and shelf-life are acceptable. Based on the maximum daily dose of 50 mg 
(one capsule per day), the ICH identification threshold is 0.2%. The limit for total impurities is 
acceptable based on the limits for individual impurities and stability data. 
The limit for dissolution is acceptable based on the results of the 100 mg capsule batch used in the BE 
study.

Two degradation products have been specified. Limits are stated to have been based on batches used 
in toxicological studies. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on three batches of 50 mg and 100 mg ritlecitinib capsules using a validated ICP-MS method was 
provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the 
respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it 
is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested in a Major Objection) considering all suspected and actual root 
causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the 
CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 
5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Specific details of the expected nitrite level in each component of the finished 
product have been provided and the details on the analytical procedure (LC-UV/MS) used for the 
analysis of nitrosamines in WHO NAP test and acetic acid standard conditions, such as the limit of 
detection and limit of quantitation, as well as the results of the experiments performed to test the 
reactivity of the active substance and its impurities towards nitrosation, have been provided. The 
results of these experiments have been discussed in the context of the conditions existing in the 
finished product and are considered extreme / forced degradation conditions. The potential risk of 
nitrosamine formation from packaging has also been addressed. The overall risk for nitrosamine 
formation is negligible. The API-specific nitrosamine impurity has been shown to be not detected (LOD 
< 10% of AI of 18 ng/day), and no further control is considered necessary. Overall, based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The omission of tests for water content and chiral purity has been adequately justified.  
Water content is not included on the specification since water activity has been selected as the 
analytical test to measure moisture levels for the product. 
Ritlecitinib has two chiral centres, neither of which is adjacent to a strong electron withdrawing group. 
Both chiral centres have to isomerise to form the enantiomer. The finished product HPLC impurity 
method is capable of detecting the two diastereomers, which have not been observed under long term, 
accelerated stability studies or forced degradation studies. Based on the above, no control or 
acceptance criterion for the enantiomer of ritlecitinib is proposed. 
The analytical procedures used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines, including the microbiological procedures for which suitability in the 
presence of the finished product has been shown. The stability indicating the nature of the proposed 
analytical procedure for assay and degradation products in the finished product has been 
demonstrated. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for six batches of ritlecitinib 50 mg capsules, supplemented by data 
from seven batches of 30 mg capsules and six batches from 100 mg capsules confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.

2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The primary registration programme consists of three pilot scale batches of the 50 mg strength, plus 
three pilot scale batches of each of the 30 mg (not proposed for marketing), and 100 mg (not 
proposed for marketing) capsule strengths. The batches were manufactured at Pfizer, Freiburg, 
Germany using the commercial formulation process and contain active substance lots prepared using 
the commercial processes. The batches of Litfulo are representative to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Eighteen months stability data at 25°C / 60% RH and 30°C / 65% RH (HDPE bottle) or 30°C / 75% RH 
(blister) and six months at the accelerated condition of 40°C / 75% RH are provided. 
A supplementary stability programme is also included, referred to as Process Understanding, which 
consists of one batch of each of the 30 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg capsule strength, manufactured at 
Pfizer, Freiburg, Germany, containing an active substance lot prepared using the commercial 
processes. Twelve months stability data at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C / 65% RH (HDPE bottle) or 
30°C / 75% (blister) RH and six months at the accelerated condition of 40°C / 75% RH are provided. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, water 
activity and microbiological attributes. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Except 
for the assay and degradation products procedure, the analytical procedures proposed for release are 
used during the stability study. An earlier version of the HPLC procedure for assay and degradation 
products was used up to 12 months of the stability study and for the forced degradation study. 
Validation data are provided for the analytical procedure that was used during the first 12 months of 
the stability study. 
The primary registration and supplementary stability studies have demonstrated that degradation 
products are the only attributes trending on stability. No stability trends have been observed for 
appearance, assay and dissolution.  
In addition, one batch of each capsule strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Samples were tested for appearance, 
assay, degradation products and dissolution. No significant changes were observed in assay, 
degradation products and dissolution for samples directly exposed to light. Some fading of the blue 
capsule color was observed for samples directly exposed under ICH Option 2 and 2 x ICH Option 1 
conditions. This justifies the proposed storage condition “Store in the original package in order to 
protect from light”. 
Forced degradation experiments were performed on ritlecitinib 30 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg capsules to 
establish the extent and nature of potential degradation pathways and to confirm the suitability of the 
LC assay and purity method. The stress conditions included thermal/low humidity, thermal/mild 
humidity, thermal/high humidity, and photolysis studies. Samples were analysed for potency and 
degradation products, as well chiral purity. The studies showed an increase in degradation under 
thermal stress conditions. The degradation was more pronounced under thermal / high humidity stress 
conditions. These studies confirm that the assay and purity method is selective and stability indicating. 
There was no chiral conversion observed in any of the forced degradation studies. 
In-use stability studies have been performed with several batches of 50 mg capsules packaged in 
HDPE bottles, in line with the CHMP Note for Guidance on in-use stability testing of human medicinal 
products. The current in-use study lasted 60 days, which is acceptable given of EMA Q & A on the 
design of in-use stability studies (2 containers x 28 count). The capsules were tested for appearance, 
assay, degradation products and dissolution and water content. Acceptable appearance, assay, 
degradation products and dissolution data were obtained after the bottles were left opened for 60 days

stored at 30°C/65% RH for each of the time points. Water content did not significantly increase. Based 
on the data available, an in-use period is not considered necessary for the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months without any special temperature 
storage condition, but stored in the original package in order to protect from light as stated in the 
SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Two major objections were raised by the CHMP during the 
procedure on: 1) the biowaiver of strength, and the supporting in vitro dissolution comparisons, and on 
2) the risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished 
product. These were satisfactorily addressed by the applicant by providing additional data and further 
justifications.   
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance Design spaces 
have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the active substance. The design spaces 
have been adequately verified.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) is an orally bioavailable, selective, covalent, irreversible inhibitor of JAK3 
and the TEC kinase family.  
Within the scope of the pharmacodynamics assessment of ritlecitinib, the applicant conducted a series 
of primary, secondary and safety pharmacology studies. At the time of marketing authorisation 
application, the dossier consisted of eighteen in vitro and four in vivo primary pharmacology studies, 
four in vitro secondary pharmacodynamics studies and two in vitro and four in vivo safety 
pharmacology studies. In addition, a research article from Dai et al., 2021 was attached discussing the 
effect of ritlecitinib in an AA animal model of disease.  
In addition, the applicant submitted an extensive non-clinical programme to examine the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) in relevant non-clinical animal species and in humans, including investigations 
on ADME and the potential of ritlecitinib and its major plasma metabolite M2 to induce PK drug-drug 
interactions (DDI). In particular, 5 study reports on analytical methods and validations, 4 absorption 
studies, 7 distribution studies, 7 metabolism studies, one excretion study, and 19 non-clinical PK drug 
interaction studies were submitted.  
The applicant submitted an extensive toxicological programme. Specifically, 4 single dose toxicity 
studies, 7 repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs (including one in vivo micronucleus study), 3 
in vitro genotoxicity studies, 4 carcinogenicity studies (including 2 dose-range finding studies) in rats 
and mice, 1 fertility study in rats, 4 embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies (dose-range finding and 
pivotal) in rats and rabbits, 1 pre- and postnatal development (PPND) study in rats, 1 immunotoxicity 
mouse study, 5 exploratory mechanistic studies, 15 impurity qualification studies (in vivo and in vitro), 
and 1 phototoxicity study in rats were submitted.  
Genetic toxicity studies included a standard battery of in vitro assays (bacterial reverse mutagenicity, 
micronucleus in TK6 cells), mechanistic follow-up testing for in vitro micronucleus test results, and an 
in vivo blood reticulocyte micronucleus assay in rats conducted as part of the 8-week pivotal repeat-
dose toxicity study.  
The potential for carcinogenicity was assessed in a 6-month study in transgenic rasH2 (tg/wt) mice 
and a 2-year study in rats in accordance with ICH Guidelines M3(R2), 2009. Doses for the 6-month 
study in transgenic mice were selected based on results from a 2-week study in C57BL/6NTac mice 
and a 1-month study in rasH2 (wt/wt) mice. Design and doses for the 2-year carcinogenicity study in 
rats were selected based on results from the 6-month toxicity study in rats. 
Developmental and reproductive studies were completed in rats and rabbits. These included a fertility 
and early embryonic development study in male and female rats, DRF and pivotal EFD studies in 
pregnant rats and rabbits, and a pre- and postnatal development study in rats. Rats and rabbits were 
selected for the evaluation of reproductive and developmental toxicity because of the extensive 
background knowledge accumulated in these species, and because they have been proven susceptible 
to the effects of developmental and reproductive toxicants. A GLP-compliant juvenile toxicity study in 
juvenile male and female rats with dose administration on PND 10-60 with a 2-month recovery to 
examine postnatal growth and development and potential effects on bone and nervous system was 
submitted upon CHMP’s request.  
An in vivo immunotoxicity study was conducted in mice (mouse allergy model) to characterise the risk 
for hypersensitivity reactions, and phototoxicity was evaluated in rats based on light absorbance within 
290-700 nm. In line with ICH M7(R1), 2018, a 13-week impurity qualification toxicity study was

Page 25/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted in rats to qualify potential drug substance and drug product impurities. Several potential 
impurities were evaluated in in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays. Other impurities were evaluated 
and qualified or appropriately controlled based on ICH quality guidelines and process knowledge. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Potency and selectivity of ritlecitinib and its main metabolite PF-07034562 against human Janus 
kinases (JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3) and tyrosine kinase (TYK2) was investigated in a calliper enzyme assay 
(study number 184021 and 123643, respectively). In addition, activity of ritlecitinib against a panel of 
further protein kinases (>300) was evaluated in kinase screening assays (Z′-LYTE Screening Assay and 
LanthaScreen assay; study number 151236).  
Inhibitor potency of ritlecitinib by covalent inactivation (kinact/Ki) was determined for JAK3 and several 
other kinases such as BTK, BLK, BMX, ITK, TEC, SLK, FGR, and FLT3 by a time-resolved Förster 
resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay, except for TXK where a classic pyruvate kinase/lactate 
dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) coupled enzyme assay was utilised (study number 184157). 
In study number 101033, the nonspecific chemical reactivity of ritlecitinib to recombinant human 
serum albumin (HSA) was investigated by detecting covalent adduct formation via mass spectrometry. 
Generally, the primary cell potency of ritlecitinib was investigated in lymphocytes and whole blood. The 
potency of ritlecitinib to inhibit cytokine-mediated STAT phosphorylation was investigated in human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; study number 184605), human whole blood (hWB; study 
number 184417) and whole blood of rats and dogs (study number 102317) by flow cytometry.  
The effect of ritlecitinib on proinflammatory cytokine production was investigated in LPS stimulated 
human monocytes and macrophages by measuring levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα using a Meso Scale 
Discovery (MSD) multiplex cytokine kit and compared to the effect of JAK1 and pan-JAK inhibitors 
(study number 185220). In addition, study 185307 examined the influence of ritlecitinib on IL-27 
primed and with TNFα or IL-1β stimulated macrophages, again compared to a JAK1 inhibitor.   
In study number 044630, ritlecitinib’s effect on differentiation and expansion of human Th1, Th2, Th17 
and B cells was evaluated by monitoring the production of IFNγ, IL-5/IL-13, IL-17A and IgG, 
respectively. 
Cellular potency of ritlecitinib against BTK and ITK, both members of the TEC family kinases, was 
assessed by measuring B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) mediated upregulation of the 
cell surface marker CD69 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD4+ T cells (study 
number 023747). 
The potency of ritlecitinib to inhibit the in vitro functional activity of activated human NK cells and 
CD8+ T cells was investigated by flow cytometry, measuring the cytolytic granule protein (CD107a) on 
the cell surface, and intracellular IFN-γ (study number 011358).   
In study number 090414, the potency of ritlecitinib on cytokine-mediated phosphorylation of signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins was evaluated in various cell types.  
The occupancy of JAK3 and TEC kinase family by ritlecitinib in human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell (PBMC) lysates was measured by using a clickable probe (a close analogue of ritlecitinib/PF-
06651600) in a TMT-10plex mass spectrometry assay (study number 023828).  
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

Kinase domains of Human JAK3 and TEC kinase family proteins were defined by databases (e.g. 
UniProt, NCBI RefSeq) and/or derived from Gnomon-predicted gene models (Souvorov, 2010) and 
compared to their corresponding canine and rat orthologous.  
Study number 094745 compared the effects of several JAK inhibitors (pan JAKi, JAK1i, JAK1/TYK2i and 
ritlecitinib as JAK3 inhibitor) on thrombopoietin and interleukin 6 signalling and cell expansion in 
megakaryocyte precursor cells by flow cytometry. 
The effect on the clearance of thrombopoietin (TPO) by human platelets was investigated for five JAK 
inhibitors, including ritlecitinib (study number 033455), because JAK2 is known to be mainly involved 
in TPO and platelet homoeostasis.  
To assess the efficacy and pharmacodynamics (PD) response of ritlecitinib in vivo, several animal 
models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases were used (e.g., rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis 
(study number 090652), chemically induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mouse models (study 
number 181316), a mouse adoptive transfer model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (study 
number 100542) and an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple 
sclerosis (study number 085612). 
The research article of Dai et al., 2021 discussed the PD of JAK inhibitors in a mouse model of AA. The 
effect of ritlecitinib at a dosage of 30mg/kg/day, intravenously administered via an osmotic pump, on 
disease onset (4 weeks treatment) and disease progression/revision (12 weeks treatment) was 
investigated in C3H/HeJ skin-grafted mice. Furthermore, topical administration of ritlecitinib [2% 
(w/w)], twice daily for 12 weeks in C3H/HeJ mice with long-standing AA, was also investigated. 
The results of the potency and selectivity assays (study numbers 184021 and 151236) indicate a high 
selectivity of ritlecitinib for JAK3 (IC50 of 0.346 nM at the apparent ATP and IC50 of 33.1nM at 1mM 
ATP) and, to a lesser extent, for protein kinases as TXK, TEC, BMX and BTC with a CYS at the same 
position as CYS 909 in JAK3. The lowest selectivity ratios over JAK3 could be determined, with 83.8 for 
BMX at the apparent Km for ATP and 5.9 for TXK at 1mM ATP. The results of study number 123643 
revealed no PD activity for the main metabolite M2.  
Kinetic parameters (kinact, Ki and kinact/Ki), describing the covalent adduct formation and; therefore, 
inhibitor potency of ritlecitinib with selected kinases, underline the selectivity of ritlecitinib for JAK3 
(kinact/Ki ratio of 3.68x105M-1s-1). Only kinases containing a cysteine proximal to the ATP binding pocket 
at the same position as JAK3 showed irreversible covalent adduct formation to ritlecitinib, but with 
lower kinact/Ki ratios (e.g. 1.03x104M-1s-1 for BMX) compared to JAK3 (study number 184157). 
2% of human serum albumin (HSA) was found to form adducts at the highest concentration of 320µM 
ritlecitinib, whereas the positive control canertinib even showed traces of adduct formation at the 
lowest tested concentration of 1µM (study number 101033). Therefore, no adduct formation with HSA 
was noticed at the expected unbound Cmax of 1.1µM ritlecitinib for a clinical daily dose of 50 mg. 
Ritlecitinib inhibited the JAK1/JAK3 signalling pathway in IL-15 stimulated human PBMCs (IC50 51.7nM) 
and hWB (IC50 198nM) and in IL-21 stimulated hWB (IC50 of 362nM). Minor or almost negligible 
inhibition was observed for JAK1/TYK2 (IC50 12106nM) and JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 (IC50 17823nM) signalling 
pathways in PBMCs. No effect could be demonstrated for other cytokines/signalling pathways, neither 
in PBMCs nor in hWB. Comparison of IC50 values obtained in IL-15 and IL-21 stimulated whole blood of 
humans (IC50 198nM and IC50 of 362nM, respectively), rats (137nM and 302nM, respectively) and dogs 
(170nM and 212nM, respectively) indicate a similar potency of ritlecitinib to inhibit STAT 
phosphorylation (study numbers 184605, 184417 and 102317). 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

Ritlecitinib as JAK3 selective inhibitor did not change proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6, and 
TNFα) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, ritlecitinib could not reverse the IL-27-mediated 
effects in study 185307, compared to a JAK1 inhibitor.  
As shown in study 044630, ritlecitinib potently inhibited the production of IFNγ, IL-5/IL-13, IL-17A and 
IgG in Th1, Th2, and Th17 (during the differentiation phase) and human B cells (IC50 values of 34, 
17.1/24.1, 211 and 86nM, respectively), as well as in Th1 and Th17 differentiated cells (49 and 278 
nM, respectively). 
Some inhibitory potential of ritlecitinib for the TEC family kinase members BTK (IC50 of 344nM) and ITK 
(IC50 of 380nM) was observed in human PBMC and CD4+ T cells (study number 023747).  
Ritlecitinib inhibited human NK and CD8+ T cell activity in study number 011358, represented by IC50 
values for CD107a+ of 509nM and 210nM in NK and CD8+ cells, respectively and an IC50 value of 
188nM for intracellular IFN-γ production in both cell types. This effect was supposed to be ITK 
dependent, according to the applicant. 
In the cellular potency assay (study number 090414), ritlecitinib showed its most inhibitory activity on 
IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation (via JAK1/JAK3 signalling) in T-cells (IC50 value of 226nM), 
whereas in B-cells an IC50 of 1000nM was observed and in monocytes and HT-29 cells the IC50 values 
increased up to >20000nM. Only a minor effect was observed on IL-31 mediated STAT3 inhibition in 
THP1 cells (IC50 of 4400nM, JAK1/JAK2 signalling) and no inhibitory potential was found on IL-13 (via 
JAK1/JAK2/TYK2, STAT6) and IL-22 (via JAK1/TYK2, STAT3) induced STAT phosphorylation (IC50 
>20000nM).  
The occupancy assay (study number 023828) revealed an OC50 of 73nM ritlecitinib for JAK3, and 
similar values for the TEC kinase family members BTK, BMX and TEC, whereas for ITK and RLK OC50 
values were observed to be 2-fold higher. 
Within the scope of the sequence homology analysis, canine JAK3 was found to be 94% identical to 
human JAK3 and rat JAK3 to 87% identical to human JAK3.  
As demonstrated in study 094745, ritlecitinib led to weak inhibition of TPO-induced STAT5 and IL-6-
induced STAT3 phosphorylation and expansion of CD41a+ cells, with IC50 values greater than 20000 (in 
contrast to the other JAK inhibitors used in this assay).   
The inhibitory potential of ritlecitinib on TPO clearance investigated in study number 033455 was low 
(IC50 value of >20000nM), which is supported by the minor potential to inhibit JAK2 (IC50 of 
>10000nM reported in study number 184021). Overall, the higher the inhibitory concentration at 50% 
activity for JAK2 of a compound, the lower the inhibitory potential on TPO clearance. However, the 
more potent JAK2 inhibitors showed only a maximum of about 10% inhibition of TPO clearance. 
In terms of the PD in vivo data, ritlecitinib showed to have immunosuppressive potential, reflected by 
improvements of disease parameters, in the adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model (study number 
090652), in the chemically induced inflammatory bowel disease mouse model (study number 181316) 
and the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (study number 085612). 
Intravenously administered ritlecitinib at 30mg/kg prevented the onset of AA by effectively reducing 
AA-associated skin inflammation (e.g. supported by data from immunofluorescence and flow 
cytrometric analysis) and avoiding hair loss in C3H/HeJ skin grafted mice. Additionally, i.v. treatment 
with ritlecitinib at 30mg/kg effectively reversed AA, again by reducing AA-associated skin 
inflammation, demonstrated by suppression of T cell proliferation and function. Interestingly, twice 
daily topical administration of ritlecitinib (2% w/w) showed to be highly effective in the reversal of AA 
in C3H/HeJ skin-grafted mice as well (Dai et al., 2021).

2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary PD studies included a screening panel for possible (off) targets, including several receptors, 
ion channels, transporters and enzymes (study number 100009194), an in vitro assay in PAE-KDR 
cells, investigating the effect on VEGFR2 phosphorylation (study number PF-06651600-00-0010 
pVEGFR_6-1-2013) and a Z´-LYTE screening assay for Abl kinase (study number 4647_31278). In 
addition, further secondary PD activities of ritlecitinib were investigated within the scope of primary PD 
studies (studies 151236, 184021 and 184157). 
Data of the screening panel for off-target effects of ritlecitinib (at 10µM) revealed a >50% of a 
maximal inhibitory response for Abl kinase (83.2%), EGFR kinase (83.0%) and VEGFR2 kinase 
(93.5%) with corresponding IC50 values of 2800nM, 2200nM and 1300nM, respectively (study number 
100009194). In the InCell Kinase assay, ritlecitinib did not inhibit VEGFR2 phosphorylation (IC50 
>30µM) (study number PF-06651600-00-0010 pVEGFR_6-1-2013), and only a minor inhibitory 
potential of ritlecitinib for Abl kinase was observed (about 15% inhibition at 30µM), with an IC50 
>30µM (study number 4647_31278). 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Two GLP-compliant and two non-GLP-compliant safety pharmacology in vivo studies and one GLP- and 
one non-GLP-compliant in vitro assay were submitted.  
Neurofunctional and pulmonary effects of ritlecitinib were investigated in male Wistar Han IGS rats 
with each 24 animals receiving vehicle or ritlecitinib at 75, 175, or 400 mg/kg as a single dose via oral 
gavage (6 animals/group) (study number 14GR139).  
Two in vitro safety pharmacology studies were conducted in hERG gene transfected Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cells (study number 14GR206) and hERG cDNA stably transfected human embryonic 
kidney cells (HEK293) (study number 180319.QHJ) to assess ritlecitinib’s potential to inhibit the hERG 
potassium channel current to predict in vivo QT prolongation.  
Cardiovascular effects of ritlecitinib were investigated in Wistar Han Rats (n = 8/group), receiving 0 or 
125 mg/kg of the study drug on three consecutive days by oral gavage (study number 13LJ074).  
Two cardiovascular safety studies, one compliant to GLP, were conducted in conscious, unrestrained, 
radiotelemetry implanted male beagle dogs.  
In study 14GR078, each of the four dogs received vehicle control, 6mg/kg ritlecitinib or 20mg/kg 
ritlecitinib on two consecutive days and within one week.  
Then, in the GLP-compliant study 14GR140, each dog (n=4) received four treatments of single doses 
of 0, 3, 15, and 45 mg/kg of ritlecitinib via oral gavage with a washout phase of at least 6 days 
between the treatments.  
With one exception, the results of the safety pharmacology study 14GR139 revealed no statistically 
significant changes between the control group and treatment groups, neither in neurofunctional nor in 
pulmonary effects, measured by functional observational battery (FOB), body temperature and 
locomotor activity or tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute volume, respectively. One value of a 
single animal of the 400 mg/kg ritlecitinib dosage group led to a higher mean respiratory rate at 240 
minutes post-dose, which was not considered relevant due to its late occurrence.  
In study 14GR206, significant inhibition (12.9%) of the hERG potassium current in hERG gene 
transfected CHO cells was achieved with the highest tested concentration of ritlecitinib at 30µM with an 
IC50 value for hERG current inhibition of >30µM ritlecitinib. In hERG cDNA stably transfected HEK293

cells (study number 180319. QHJ), hERG was statistically significantly inhibited at concentrations of 
100µM and 300µM ritlecitinib (16.5% and 31.0%, respectively), but not at the lowest concentration of 
30µM. The IC50 value of ritlecitinib on hERG inhibition was estimated to be >300µM in this study. 
In the non-GLP cardiovascular (CV) study in rats (study number 13LJ074), an increase in systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) was noticed after the 
first administration of 125mg/kg ritlecitinib on day 1 (max. of +5mmHg for SBP), whereas a decrease 
in SBP, MBP (max. of-4.2mmHg for SBP) and temperature (max. of -0.5°C) was observed on study 
day 3, each compared to vehicle control.  
In the non-GLP CV safety study in dogs (study number 14GR078), significant and test-article-related 
decreases in systolic (-4 to -7 mmHg), diastolic (-3 to -4 mmHg) and mean blood pressure (-3 to -5 
mmHg) were noticed for animals treated with 20mg/kg ritlecitinib and in heart rate values (-5 to -11 
bpm and -4 to -12 bpm, respectively) for both doses at 6 and 20mg/kg. Some increases (+4 to +7 
msec) in the QT-Interval were seen as well (6 and 20mg/kg); however, for the corrected QT-Interval 
(QTc) no changes were observed.  
Data from the GLP-compliant CV safety study in beagle dogs (study number 14GR140) revealed no 
ritlecitinib-related, significant changes in telemetry data at the lower doses of 3 and 15mg/kg. A 
significant and test-article-related increase in heart rate (HR, +15 bpm) and a decrease in QT-Interval 
(-11 msec) was observed 0.5 to 3.5 hours post-dose. However, the corrected QT Interval (QTc) did not 
indicate any ritlecitinib-related changes compared to values obtained from vehicle-treated animals. 
Ritlecitinib concentrations in plasma increased dose-proportionally 4 hours post-dose. A Cmax of 
12800ng/ml and Tmax of 1.7 hours at 45mg/kg could be determined. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were performed by the applicant. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
In terms of non-clinical analytical methods and validations, the applicant submitted five GLP-compliant 
validation reports on the LC-MS/MS analyses applied for the detection of ritlecitinib in mouse, rat, 
rabbit and dog plasma (study 021727, study 095401, study 083814 and study 095221, respectively), 
the non-clinical animal species used for experimentation in the submitted dossier. Furthermore, a 
qualification assay was submitted for the detection of M2 in rat plasma (study 202346MQSMB_PGC).  
In the submitted validation reports, intra- and inter-assay accuracy and precision (evaluated with 
regular QC samples, dilution QC samples, and transparency assessments), calibration linearity, 
reproducibility, stability (processed sample stability, benchtop stability, freeze/thaw stability, long-term 
storage stability, working solution stability), matrix effects, selectivity and carryover were examined. 
Finally, in the submitted qualification study of M2 in Wistar Han rat plasma, the applicant qualified 
accuracy and precision (of regular QC and dilution QC samples), linearity of the calibration range, 
inter-lot selectivity, benchtop stability, freeze/thaw stability, matrix effects, extraction recovery and 
reinjection reproducibility. The submitted validation reports generally demonstrated that the evaluated 
validation endpoints generally proved to be acceptable when compared with their pre-specified limits. 
Therefore, the applied LC-MS/MS methods can reliably detect ritlecitinib in non-clinical animal plasma.

Absorption 
In terms of absorption, the applicant submitted 3 single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) studies and one 
repeated dose PK study. Absorption after oral administration was also assessed in the frame of 
toxicokinetic evaluations. 
In study 152020, the PK of ritlecitinib were examined in male SD rats (n=2 per group) after i.v. 
injection (0.71 mg/kg) or after oral administration (3 mg/kg). Furthermore, in one of the groups in this 
study (n=4), biliary and urinary excretion of ritlecitinib was studied after i.v. bolus administration of 1 
or 1.5 mg/kg ritlecitinib. Similarly, in study 145444, the PK of ritlecitinib were examined after i.v. (3 
mg/kg) or oral (30 mg/kg) administration to male C57BL6 mice (n=3). In study 132012, the applicant 
examined the PK of ritlecitinib when orally (3 mg/kg) or intravenously (1 mg/kg) administered to male 
Beagle dogs (n=2 per group). In study 105110, the applicant investigated the PK of ritlecitinib and its 
metabolite M2 in JVC/CAC surgerised Wistar Hannover rats (n=5 per sex and dose group and sampling 
point) after oral QD administration of 200 mg/kg ritlecitinib for 7 consecutive days.  
Mean oral Tmax levels were rapidly attained in the submitted absorption studies and ranged from 0.25 
hours post-dose in the mouse and dog study to 0.42 hours in the repeated dose rat study 105110 and 
0.5 hours post-dose in the single dose rat study 152020. This demonstrates rapid enteral absorption of 
orally administered ritlecitinib in the tested non-clinical species. The Tmax of the major plasma 
metabolite M2 in the repeated dose rat study 105110 was attained already 1.4 hours post-dose, 
demonstrating the rapid conversion of ritlecitinib to M2 after gastrointestinal absorption. Efficient 
gastrointestinal absorption is supported by high calculated oral bioavailabilities in the submitted non-
clinical absorption studies, which ranged from 61% in male mice to 85% in male rats and 100% in 
male dogs. At an equal oral dose (3 mg/kg), these oral bioavailabilities translated into a Cmax at 4100 
ng/mL and an AUCinf at 1250 ng*h/mL in male dogs, and a Cmax at 173 ng/mL and AUCinf at 446 
ng*h/mL in male rats. In subgroups of these experiments to which ritlecitinib was intravenously 
administered, clearance, the volume of distribution and plasma T1/2 were calculated. Plasma clearance 
in rodents was high, amounting to 45 mL/min/kg in male mice and even 69 mL/min/kg in rats. These 
rates are below or similar to the mean liver blood flow in these species, amounting to 90 mL/min/kg in 
mice and 68.7 mL/min/kg in rats (Davies and Morris 1993). In male dogs, plasma clearance or 
ritlecitinib was clearly smaller, only amounting to 13 mL/min/kg. This rate is below the hepatic blood 
flow of dogs, being 30.9 mL/min/kg (Davies and Morris 1993). The fact that clearance in these species 
is similar to or lower than their respective hepatic blood flow suggests that absorbed ritlecitinib may 
rapidly be cleared by hepatic pathways (in the case of ritlecitinib through hepatic metabolism). The 
calculated volumes of distribution were similar between the different species and ranged from 0.84 
L/kg in male mice to 1.1 L/kg in male dogs to 1.4 L/kg in male rats. These values suggest that 
ritlecitinib partitions throughout the total body water. Plasma T1/2 values in the investigated species 
were low and ranged from 0.33 hours in male rats and 1.1 hours in male dogs to 1.3 hours in male 
mice. These rapid plasma elimination half-lifes together with the rapid Tmax value of M2 in male rats 
(1.4 hours post-dose) support the notion of rapid hepatic elimination of ritlecitinib via metabolic 
conversion. Finally, the excretion of unchanged ritlecitinib in urine and bile in male rats proved to be 
negligible. This further supports that hepatic elimination of ritlecitinib predominates plasma clearance 
of ritlecitinib in non-clinical animal species.  
Distribution 
In regard to distribution, 7 studies were submitted.  
In the in vitro study YDP/067/018, the applicant investigated the partitioning of ritlecitinib between red 
blood cells and plasma in rat, dog and human whole blood. Similarly, in study YDP/067/369, the 
Assessment report

applicant examined the partitioning of M2 in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human whole blood. In the in 
vitro study YDP067/032, the applicant examined the protein binding capacity of ritlecitinib in mouse 
and rabbit plasma. The protein binding capacity of ritlecitinib in rat, dog, monkey and human plasma 
was evaluated in the in vitro study YDP/067/368. Similarly, the plasma protein binding capacity of M2 
was evaluated in mouse, rat, dog, rabbit and human plasma in the in vitro study YDP/067/368. In 
study 103503, the applicant conducted a more detailed in vitro assessment of the binding of [14C] PF-
06651600 to particular human plasma proteins. Specifically, 14C-labelled ritlecitinib was either added to 
aliquots of pooled human plasma specimens or preparations of albumin, high-density alpha-lipoprotein, 
fibrinogen, γ-globulin and α1-Acid glycoprotein (at physiologically relevant concentrations). Finally, in 
study 15647, the applicant examined tissue distribution of 14C-labelled ritlecitinib at 10 mg/kg after 
oral gavage administration to male pigmented Long-Evan rats in a quantitative whole body 
autoradiography setup (evaluation of one carcass per time point at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 
168, 336 and 672 hours post-dose, and evaluation in separate samples of blood, plasma and the liver 
of two animals per sampling point at 1, 4 and 24 hours post-dose). No repeated dose tissue 
distribution study was submitted.  
The mean whole blood to plasma concentration ratios for ritlecitinib were 0.985, 1.57 and 1.62 in rats, 
dogs and humans, respectively (after 1 hour of incubation). Contrarily, the whole blood to plasma 
concentration ratios of M2 in these experiments ranged between 0.545 in rats and 0.829 in rabbits 
after 1 hour of incubation. These data demonstrate that ritlecitinib either equally partitioned between 
red blood cells and plasma (in rat whole blood) or preferably partitioned to red blood cells in dog and 
human whole blood, whereas its metabolite M2 rather remained in the plasma compartment in all 
examined species.  
Ritlecitinib had a high binding capacity to proteins in mouse and rabbit plasma; specifically, only 
22.4% and 28.8% (%CV values of 18.2% and 20.8%) constituted unbound ritlecitinib in mouse or 
rabbit plasma. Contrarily, the unbound fraction of ritlecitinib in rat, dog, monkey and human plasma in 
study 154304 amounted to 67.4, 81.9, 86.0 and 86.4, respectively (with the corresponding %CV 
values being 12.9%, 13.2%, 7.4% and 14.9%). This indicates species-specific differences in the 
binding capacities of ritlecitinib to plasma proteins, particularly with large laboratory animals (dogs and 
monkeys) and humans having high unbound fractions of ritlecitinib in plasma. M2 did not bind to 
plasma proteins; in the plasma specimens of the analysed species, unbound fractions of M2 were all 
not distinguishable from 1. In human blood, the applicant established that ritlecitinib binding to high-
density alpha-lipoprotein, fibrinogen, γ-globulin and α1-acid glycoprotein was below 0.5% of the tested 
concentration; binding to platelets similarly amounted to <1%. However, binding to albumin amounted 
to approximately 6% of the total added radioactivity in study 103503. Interestingly, all protein pellet 
extractions had [14C] counts that were similar to blank incubations after 5 extractions. This suggests 
that the bound ritlecitinib to plasma proteins in this study was irreversibly bound to plasma proteins. 
The applicant described that the observed selective binding of ritlecitinib to HSA (human serum 
albumin) may be explained by the reactivity of ritlecitinib with the free cysteine 34 in HSA, presumably 
by covalent binding to HSA. This irreversible binding to albumin is not entirely unexpected, as 
ritlecitinib was designed to react with cysteine 909 within the JAK3 ATP binding pocket and might, 
therefore, also covalently bind with cysteine residues of other body proteins such as albumin. 
Furthermore, the TEC family kinases (BTK, BMX, ITK, RLK, TEC) also present a cysteine residue in their 
catalytic domain at the equivalent position of Cys909 in JAK3 and were also inhibited to various 
degrees by PF-06651600 in biochemical and cellular assays. The potential safety concerns that might 
be related to covalent binding of ritlecitinib to off-target body proteins is discussed below.  
In the single-dose administration quantitative whole body autoradiography rat study, most Tmax 
values of the investigated tissues were already reached within the first hour after administration, 
supporting the rapid enteral absorption of the orally administered ritlecitinib (as was already concluded

EMA/357337/2023

in the submitted in vivo absorption studies). At the end of the experiment at 672 hours post-dose, 
radioactivity was still above the quantification in the adrenal gland and its substructures, aorta, blood 
(cardiac), eye, heart, lens, liver, lung, kidney and its substructures, spleen and uveal tract. However, 
plasma elimination T1/2 was considerably shorter, amounting only to 55.1 hours. As in the LC-MS/MS 
based rat absorption study 152020, the T1/2 after i.v. administration only amounted to 0.33 hours, 
most of the circulating radioactivity in the whole-body autoradiography rat study were presumably 
metabolites. The short plasma elimination T1/2 in the whole-body autoradiography rat study contrasts 
considerably with the very long T1/2 values measured in many of the investigated tissues. e.g. in 
plasma and blood, Cmax & Tmax were already reached at 0.25 hours post-dose (being the first 
sampling point in this study), whereas the AUC0-t value in plasma was much lower than in blood (12.3 
vs 476 µg equivalents*hr/g in the liquid scintillation count investigation of group 2 animals, 
respectively). This demonstrates that within whole blood, ritlecitinib has a much higher tendency to 
reside (and presumably also accumulate) in blood cells than in plasma. Of note, the irreversible 
binding of ritlecitinib to haemoglobin could explain this considerable difference. The tissue half-life of 
the radioactivity associated with ritlecitinib (i.e. originating either from ritlecitinib or from its 
metabolites) was only 55.1 hours in plasma, but much higher in many investigated organs such as, 
e.g. the eyes (439.1 hours), the adrenal gland (approximately 488 hours), the cardiac blood (396.7 
hours), the spleen (478.1 hours), the pancreas (560.0 hours) and the lung (382.7 hours). 
Furthermore, the AUC0-t levels of ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites were only 12.3 µg equivalents*hr/g 
in plasma, but were much higher in most other organs (e.g. 184 µg equivalents*hr/g in the lungs, 193 
µg equivalents*hr/g in the liver, 203 µg equivalents*hr/g in the kidney, 476 µg equivalents*hr/g in the 
blood, and even 1597 µg equivalents*hr/g in the uveal tract). Both the clearly higher elimination half-
lifes and AUC exposures in most of the investigated tissues compared to the plasma demonstrate a 
strong potential for high steady-state exposure and accumulation of ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites 
in the tissue compartment at chronic dosing. Also see  non-clinical discussion section.  
Except for the brain (0.04), spinal cord (0.05), bone (0.56), white inguinal fat (0.84), thymus (0.69), 
testes (0.58), and nasal turbinates (0.83), the tissue: plasma AUCt ratios of all evaluated tissues were 
higher than 1. This demonstrates that partitioning of ritlecitinib to the tissue compartment is, in most 
cases, favoured. However, the low brain: plasma AUC ratio at ~0.04 demonstrates that penetration of 
the blood-brain barrier is inefficient in the rat. 
The high AUC and long excretion T1/2 in the uveal tract suggest melanin-related accumulation. 
However, this is not associated with phototoxicity, as evaluated in a phototoxicity rat study (study 
20075773, presented further below). Furthermore, contrarily to the very high exposure of ritlecitinib 
and/or its metabolites in the uveal tract (AUC0-t of 1597 µg equivalents*hr/g), AUC0-t levels in the skin 
were much lower, only amounting to 50 and 63 µg equivalents*hr/g in non-pigmented and pigmented 
skin, respectively. The low difference in exposure of ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites between non-
pigmented and pigmented skin further supports that generalised melanin binding unlikely explains the 
high measured exposure in the uveal tract. Finally, it was noted that in the lens, the ritlecitinib-related 
radioactivity did de facto not decrease at all between 8 hours and 672 hours post-dose in study 
152020. This was unique in the rat whole body autoradiography study and was not discussed by the 
applicant. However, as no adverse ocular effects were observed in any of the submitted toxicity 
studies, no concern was raised.  
Metabolism 
The applicant submitted 7 metabolism studies.

In the preliminary study 085839, the applicant examined the metabolism of ritlecitinib in rat, dog and 
human hepatic liver microsomes and isolated cryopreserved hepatocytes, estimated the hepatic burden 
of covalent binding of ritlecitinib in human hepatocytes, and profiled plasma, urine and bile for 
metabolites in bile-duct cannulated rats (single i.v. dose 3 mg/kg, from study JAK3-0100-BDC)) and 
one dog (15-day multiple oral 75 mg/kg/day dose, from study 13LJ111). In study 033226, the 
applicant attempted to identify the glutathione S-transferase isoforms involved in the metabolism (in 
vitro) of ritlecitinib. Furthermore, in study 011706, the applicant phenotyped the CYP450 isoforms 
involved in the in vitro transformation of ritlecitinib in human liver microsomes into its major oxidative 
metabolites 302-3 and M4. In study 092809, the applicant performed metabolite scouting with pooled 
samples from plasma and brain tissues (superior olivary nucleus, cochlear nucleus and left and right 
hippocampus) collected from the 3-day Beagle dog toxicokinetics study 17GR131 (40 mg/kg/day of 
ritlecitinib administered to female Beagle dogs (n=4) for 3 consecutive days by oral gavage). In study 
040703, the applicant examined the major circulating metabolites of ritlecitinib in pooled human 
plasma (n=16, day 14 plasma pools) and urine samples (an aliquot from each subjects Day 14 post-
dose urine sample was pooled for metabolic profiling) from the multidose clinical study B7981001. 
Furthermore, in study 085448, the applicant evaluated the routes of excretion and metabolic profiles of 
14C-labelled ritlecitinib (200 mg) in plasma and excreta in healthy male human subjects (n=6) after 
single oral administration. Finally, the applicant examined whether the major human metabolites of 
ritlecitinib, specifically M2, but potentially also M1, M3 and M4, are formed during the incubations used 
for bacterial reverse mutation assays in study 111222. 
Low levels of glutathione-conjugation related (glutathione, N-acetyl-cysteine, cysteine-glycine and 
cysteine) and oxidative (single hydroxylations) metabolites were identified in rat, dog and human liver 
microsomes and isolated cryopreserved hepatocytes. In terms of glutathione S-transferase isoforms 
involved in the metabolism (in vitro) of ritlecitinib, GST A3, GST P1, GST T2, GST Z1, MGST1,2&3 were 
the most effective isoforms to initiate glutathione conjugation of ritlecitinib (all more than 3-fold than 
the chemical reactivity of the buffer control). CYP450-mediated hydroxylations of ritlecitinib were 
observed with the following recombinant human isozymes: CYP 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 
2D6 2J2, 3A4, 3A5 and 3A7. CYP3A4/5 caused the largest contribution to oxidative turnover of 
ritlecitinib in human liver microsome preparations, and CYP2C8 and CYP1A2 contributed to a relevant 
extent to oxidative metabolism of ritlecitinib in human liver microsomes. 
The most important metabolites of ritlecitinib in the rat were hydroxylated metabolites in plasma and 
glutathione-related metabolites in urine and bile. In the dog, the major metabolites were cysteine 
conjugates in plasma (specifically the cysteine conjugate M2 and the cysteine-glycine conjugate 
metabolite 464), a cysteine conjugate in urine, and glutathione, N-acetyl-cysteine, cysteine-glycine, 
cysteine, and hydroxyl-thiol conjugates in bile. Regarding coverage of human metabolites in non-
clinical species, M2 was sufficiently present in plasma and urine in mouse, rat and dog. However, M1 
(N-acetylcysteine sulfoxide conjugate) and M3 (N-acetylcysteine conjugate) were only detected in 
plasma and urine in rodents (rats and mice), but not in dog plasma and urine (with the exception of 
M3 that was detected in dog urine). Nonetheless, the non-clinical coverage of the main human 
metabolites in the investigated non-clinical species appears sufficient, as sufficient exposure of the 
major metabolites was achieved in at least two of the non-clinical species used. Finally, the applicant 
considered that the chemical conversion of ritlecitinib into M1, M2 and M3 (glutathione conjugation 
with subsequent derivatisation of the glutathione moiety) does not harbour a toxifying effect (but 
rather leads to de-toxification and enhanced excretion). 
In the dog brain tissues (superior olivary nucleus, cochlear nucleus and left and right hippocampus) 
that were gathered in study 17GR131, the applicant predominantly detected M2 and ritlecitinib. 
However, also trace metabolites were detected in the dog brain tissues, specifically the cysteine-
glycine conjugate metabolite 464 and different single hydroxylated metabolites. Of note, the

distribution of ritlecitinib was similar between the studied brain tissues. In the dog study 092809, the 
brain: plasma fraction was 10%, contrasting the clearly lower levels determined in the quantitative 
whole body autoradiography rat study 15647 in which the radioactivity of ritlecitinib and/or its 
metabolites in the brain and the spinal cord only made 4% or 5% of the radioactivity in plasma, 
respectively. As, in addition to ritlecitinib, also its metabolites partitioned to the CNS in dog study 
092809, it can be expected that the difference in BBB crossing between the rat and the dog is higher 
than 2-fold. Based on this comparison, it is apparent that BBB crossing of ritlecitinib and/or its 
metabolites can vary between species. 
The metabolic pathways identified in humans following oral administration of 200 mg are depicted in 
the Figure 2 below. 
Figure 2: Proposed biotransformation of ritlecitinib in humans following oral administration of 200 mg 
Furthermore, parent and metabolite profiling of ritlecitinib in humans, mice, rats, and dogs is 
summarised in the Table 1 below:

In both pooled human plasma and urine, the main metabolites were M1 (N-acetylcysteine sulfoxide 
conjugate), M2 (cysteine conjugate) and M3 (N-acetylcysteine conjugate). In urine, also minor 
metabolites were identified, specifically di-hydroxylation, di-hydroxylation with hydrolysis, methyl 
sulfoxide, hydroxy-methyl sulfoxide and hydroxy N-acetylcysteine metabolites. Of note, no chiral 
inversion of ritlecitinib was observed in human plasma.  
After administration of 200 mg of 14C labelled ritlecitinib to six healthy male volunteers, the mean total 
recovery of the administered radioactivity was 85.6 % (with a SD of 9.2%) over a period of 240 hours. 
This indicates an almost complete mass balance but also renders the possibility of long-term retention 
or even accumulation of a fraction of the administered ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites. 66.1% 
(SD±13.4%) of the administered radioactivity was detected in urine and 19.5% (SD±4.4%) in faeces, 
demonstrating that renal clearance of the administered radioactivity predominates in humans. Tmax 
after oral administration was 0.75 hours, supporting rapid absorption of ritlecitinib after oral 
administration as already established in the non-clinical absorption studies. The primary plasma 
clearance pathway was metabolism of the administered ritlecitinib, specifically glutathione-conjugation 
with subsequent derivatisation of the conjugated moiety and CYP450-mediated oxidation. The 
predominating ritlecitinib species (ritlecitinib and its metabolites) measured in human plasma (within 
48 hours post-dose), urine (within 24 hours post-dose) and faeces (24-96 hours post-dose) are 
summarised in the Table 1 presented above. Of note, in human urine, ritlecitinib and M2 only made 
low fractions of the totally administered radioactivity (all below 5%), demonstrating that while both are 
the major source of radioactivity in the systemic circulation of humans, they are still not effectively 
excreted (probably demonstrating tubular re-uptake in the kidneys).  
Approximately 35% of the plasma-associated radioactivity in healthy male volunteers was non-
extractable and associated with the pellet and remains unidentified. This presumably indicates covalent 
association of ritlecitinib with plasma proteins, as was already identified in the in vitro human plasma 
protein binding study 103503 and suggested in several other studies throughout the non-clinical 
dossier. Similarly, 49.8% of the total radioactivity detected in faeces was not extractable from the 
pellet. It is conceivable that this pool partly constitutes covalent adducts of ritlecitinib with proteins 
from the gastrointestinal passage (e.g. originating from food, or shredded contents of the 
gastrointestinal mucosa) and covalent conjugates of ritlecitinib with body proteins that have been 
excreted via bile and ultimately excreted via faeces. Furthermore, from the excretion kinetics of the 
administered radioactivity in healthy human volunteers, it is apparent that from 96 hours until the end 
of the experiment (240 hours), no relevant excretion occurred. Therefore, it appears that an important 
fraction of the administered ritlecitinib had long retention times in humans and is liable for 
accumulation. This is also presumably related to the already identified covalent binding of ritlectinib to 
proteins and to the slow tissue elimination half-lives measured in the rat quantitative whole body 
autoradiography study 15647. Finally, it is noted that excretion of the administered radioactivity 
considerably varied among the six recruited subjects in study 103503. For example, in one subject, 
only 58.2% of the administered radioactivity was excreted, whereas in another subject, already 96.2% 
of the administered radioactivity was excreted between 168- and 192-hours post-dose. Of note, the 
applicant clarified that low recoveries in this study can be explained by e.g. a documented urine 
leakage from a collection container, and by non-compliance of a subject with urine collection 
instructions.  
Finally, the major human circulating metabolite M2 is formed in bacteria incubation media that were 
also used in the conducted Ames tests. While M4 was additionally detected, M1 and M3 were not 
detected. However, as M1 and M3 are similar glutathione conjugation derivatives than M2, and as for 
M1-M3 negative bacterial mutagenicity is predicted with the latest Derek Nexus and Sarah Nexus 
software packages, the applicant does not consider that these conjugation reactions introduce alerting 
moieties to the ritlecitinib structure.

Excretion 
In terms of excretion, one study was submitted.  
In study 8448335, the applicant examined whether ritlecitinib is actually excreted after a single oral 
administration (30 mg/kg) in lactating SD rats (n=16). For that purpose, milk and blood were collected 
from n=4 rats per time point at 1, 3, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Excretion into milk was found up to 8 
hours post-dose. The milk: plasma ratio was 2.21 (expressed in terms of AUC0-t), demonstrating a net 
flux of ritlecitinib from plasma into milk. In terms of Cmax, the milk: plasma mean concentration ratio 
was even 3.63 1-hour post-dose. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In terms of non-clinical pharmacokinetic drug interactions, the applicant submitted 19 in vitro studies.  
In study XT135092, the applicant examined the in vitro potential of ritlecitinib and its metabolites to 
directly inhibit CYP450 isoforms in human liver microsomes. Then, in study XT133107, the applicant 
investigated the potential of ritlecitinib to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in cultured 
cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Similarly, in study 022301, the applicant examined the potential of 
ritlecitinib to induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in cultured human hepatocytes. 
In study 121415, the applicant examined whether ritlecitinib can lead to time-dependent inhibition of 
the CYP3A4/5 activity in human microsomes. Similarly, in study 123341, the applicant investigated 
whether CYP1A2 is subject to time-dependent inhibition by ritlecitinib in human liver microsomes. 
Apart from CYP450 isoforms, the applicant also studied whether ritlecitinib (and/or potentially its 
metabolites) act as inhibitors of UGT enzyme isoforms in human liver microsomes (study 135124). 
Additionally, the applicant studied whether human recombinant glutathione S-transferase isoforms are 
susceptible to inhibition by ritlecitinib (study 094951). Then, the applicant examined whether 
ritlecitinib could inhibit sulfotransferase-mediated metabolism in human liver cytosol (study 111809). 
In addition to ritlecitinib, also enzyme inhibition and induction studies were conducted with M2. 
Specifically, in study 111635 the applicant examined whether M2 acts as a reversible and time-
dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 3A4/5, CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 in human liver microsomes. 
Then, in study 090107, the applicant investigated whether M2 induces CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C in cultured human hepatocytes. Finally, in study 034526, the applicant examined whether M2 is 
an inhibitor of UGT enzyme activities in human liver microsomes. In terms of transporter protein 
mediated drug interactions, the applicant examined whether ritlecitinib is an inhibitor of the MDR1, 
OATP1B1, OAT1B3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K transporters in in vitro cellular apical to basolateral 
transport assays with MDCKII and HEK293 cells (that stably expressed the relevant transporter 
proteins) (study 103701). Similarly, the applicant examined whether ritlecitinib inhibits the transporter 
proteins BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1 in HEK293 cells (which stably expressed 
the respective transporter proteins) and in BCRP vesicles (study 101345). Then, in study 090524, the 
applicant assessed whether ritlecitinib is a substrate of the human transporter proteins OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 in an incubation experiment using HEK293 cells that stably express these proteins. Also, in 
study 112105 (or study 18PFIZP1R1S1), the applicant investigated whether ritlecitinib is a substrate of 
BCRP (ABCG2) in transfected MDCK cells. Finally, in study Pfizer-76-09Jan2018, the applicant 
examined whether ritlecitinib is a substrate of BCRP (ABCG2) in transfected MDCK cells. Transporter 
inhibition studies were also conducted with M2. In study 073254, the applicant examined whether M2 
is an inhibitor of the transporters BCRP, MATE1, MATE2K, MDR1, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OCT1, and OCT2 (in HEK293 cells vesicles that express or contain these transporters). Similarly, in 
study 063458, the applicant examined whether M2 is an in vitro transporter substrate of human MDR1 
in a bidirectional permeability assay using MDCK cells that over-express human MDR1. Finally, in the

PBPK study 032218, the applicant modelled whether ritlecitinib as a perpetrator could cause clinically 
relevant DDIs of concomitantly administered drugs.  
In human liver microsomes, no relevant inhibitions (IC50 close or higher than 100 μM) of CYP1A2, 
3A4/5, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 were observed when ritlecitinib was concomitantly incubated 
with the isoform-specific test substrates. Similar low inhibitions were observed when the human liver 
microsomes were pre-incubated with ritlecitinib in the absence of NADPH for 30 minutes. However, 
clear inhibitions of CYP1A2 (IC50 of 65 μM) and CYP3A4/5 (IC50 ranging from 11 to 14 μM) were 
observed when the human liver microsomes were pre-incubated with ritlecitinib and NADPH. This 
indicates that for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5, ritlecitinib has a time- and NADPH-dependent inhibition 
potential. In human hepatocytes cultures, ritlecitinib induced increases in CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 mRNA 
levels and CYP2B6 activity at 50 μM or higher when incubated 3 days in the hepatocyte cultures prior 
to activity evaluation of the respective CYP450 enzymes. In a subsequent CYP450 induction study in 
cultured human hepatocytes (study 022301), addition of ritlecitinib to human hepatocytes for 2 
consecutive days resulted in the induction of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Of 
note, the applicant estimates that the theoretical unbound liver inlet ritlecitinib concentration at the 
proposed clinical dosing regimen is 8 μM. The ritlecitinib levels at which CYP450 induction was 
identified in this study were already in the same range. For example, induction of CYP3A4 already 
started in the range of 6-30 μM depending on the cell lot. Also, for CYP1A2, induction was already 
observed at 3 - 6 μM depending on the cell lot. Similarly, for CYP2C8, induction was already observed 
from 3 - 10 μM in all three cell lots. 
Interestingly, the ritlecitinib concentration added to the human hepatocytes during the first phase of 
the experiment, and the subsequent CYP3A4-mediated turn-over kinetics of the isoform-specific test 
substrate (midazolam) in the second phase of the experiment, proved to be inversely proportional. 
Conversely, the incubations with ritlecitinib caused substantial enzyme induction of CYP3A4, as 
measured by CYP3A4 mRNA levels. A direct influence of ritlecitinib on enzyme activity in the second 
phase of the conducted experiment in study 022301 can, however, be excluded, as the cell media of 
the first experimental phase (in which ritlecitinib was added to the incubation) were removed and as 
the cells were subsequently rinsed before enzyme activities toward the test substrates were evaluated. 
This effect is illustrated in one of the cell lots used in study 022301 in the Figure 3 below: 
Figure 3: Effect of ritlecitinib on CYP3A4 mRNA and enzyme activity in cultured human hepatocytes 
Of note, similarly to CYP3A4/5 induction and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5 by ritlecitinib in 
the human hepatocyte culture study 022301, this particular isoform also showed strong time-
dependent inhibition by ritlecitinib in human liver microsomes (however, only in the presence of 
NADPH, study 121415). Finally, time-dependent (and NADPH dependent) inhibition of CYP1A2 by 
ritlecitinib was similarly observed as for CYP3A4/5, albeit at clearly lower potency. However, in 
contrast to human liver microsomes, no clear time-dependent inhibition was observed in the induction 
study 022301 in human hepatocyte cultures.

In respect to the inhibition of UGT isoforms, the applicant found that UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 activity was 
inhibited by ritlecitinib with an IC50 value of 54 and 81 µM in human liver microsomes (in the absence 
of bovine serum albumin (BSA), in the presence of BSA IC50 values were higher).  
No relevant inhibition of human recombinant glutathione S-transferases was detected by ritlecitinib. 
Similarly, no relevant inhibitions of the tested SULT isoforms 1E1, 1A1, and 2A1 by ritlecitinib were 
observed in human liver cytosol. Finally, M2 did not inhibit or induce the tested CYP450 isoforms in 
human liver microsomes or cultured human hepatocytes to a relevant extent (also, no time-dependent 
inhibition was observed), and did not inhibit the tested UGT isoforms in human liver microsomes to a 
relevant extent.  
In terms of transporter protein inhibition, ritlecitinib did not cause relevant inhibitions of MDR1, 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (IC50 values above 300 μM). However, ritlecitinib inhibited OCT2 (IC50 of 55.2 
μM), MATE1 (IC50 of 51.4 μM) and MATE2K (IC50 of 48.3 μM). Furthermore, ritlecitinib was not a 
relevant inhibitor of OAT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (IC50 values of 156.0, 311.8 and 933.6 μM, 
respectively). However, ritlecitinib inhibited BCRP and OAT3 at IC50 values of 27.0 and 41.3 μM, 
respectively, and very strongly inhibited OCT1 at an IC50 value of only 3.74 μM. Similarly, ritlecitinib 
was a substrate of BCRP at 0.5 and 2 μM. Finally, ritlecitinib was not an inhibitor of the BSEP efflux 
transporter (IC50 value >200 μM). Additionally, M2 inhibited OCT1 (IC50 at 0.86 μM), OATP1B1 (IC50 at 
2.0 μM), BCRP (IC50 at 5.6 μM), OATP1B3 (IC50 at 8.4 μM) and MDR1 (IC50 at 44.1 μM), but did not 
inhibit MATE1, MATE2K, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 to a relevant extent (IC50 at >300 μM). M2 also proved 
to be a substrate of MDR1 (at 0.3, 1, and 3 μM). Considering that the applicant estimates the steady 
state unbound Cmax of ritlecitinib at 1.1 μM and its theoretical unbound liver inlet concentration at 8 
μM, many of these IC50 values could translate into clinically relevant PK drug interactions. For the 
clinical assessment of transporter-mediated pharmacokinetic interactions, see section 2.6 on clinical 
aspects.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
In terms of single-dose toxicity studies, the toxicokinetics of ritlecitinib after oral gavage administration 
were evaluated in rats (n=3) at 0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg ritlecitinib (study 13MA012). Then, 1-day 
oral dose exploratory toxicity was evaluated in dogs (n=1 per sex) at 20, 90 and 300 mg/kg ritlecitinib 
(study 13LJ078). Additionally, single-dose oral toxicokinetics were analysed in male Wistar Han IGS 
rats (n=3) at 25, 75 and 200 mg/kg ritlecitinib (study 14MA133). Finally, single dose modified release 
capsule toxicokinetics were studied in Beagle dogs (n=3 per sex) at 65 mg (study 16GR208). All 
studies were non-GLP compliant.  
Ritlecitinib was well tolerated in the submitted single-dose toxicity studies. Clinical effects related to 
ritlecitinib administration were emesis and partially closed eyes in dogs (study 13LJ078) and watery 
faeces in the dog study 16GR208. Tmax was rapidly attained in the single-dose toxicity studies (with 
the exception of the release capsule study) both in rats (ranging from 1 to 1.67 hours post-dose) and 
in dogs (ranging from 0.5 to 3 hours post-dose). 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat-dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity (after oral gavage administration) was examined in rats and in Beagle dogs. In 
total, seven studies were submitted. In the non-GLP compliant study 13MA039, ritlecitinib was 
administered at 0, 125, 300 and 500 mg/kg/day for a consecutive period of 14 days to male Wistar 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 39/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Han rats (n=5). Then, in the GLP-compliant study 14GR132, 0, 75 and 175 mg/kg/day of ritlecitinib 
were administered for 8 consecutive weeks (and at 400 mg/kg/day for 31 consecutive days) to Wistar 
HAN (Crl:WI[Han]) rats (n=10 per group and sex). Note that a micronucleus evaluation was included 
in study 14GR132. Finally, in the pivotal and GLP-compliant rat repeated dose toxicity study 
20070067, 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg//day of ritlecitinib were administered for six consecutive months 
to Crl:WI(Han) rats (n=15 animals per group and sex). In this pivotal rat toxicity study, the 
reversibility of effects was assessed in n=5 animals per group and sex in the vehicle and the highest 
dose group. Of note, toxicokinetics in the submitted rat repeated dose toxicity studies were 
investigated in satellite groups (n=3 per sex and group, treated at the same dosing regimens used in 
the main study fraction) at 1-, 3-, 8- and 24-hours post-dose. In Beagle dogs, repeated dose toxicity 
was at first studied in the non-GLP compliant exploratory study 13LJ111, in which ritlecitinib was 
administered at 0, 15, 45 and 75 mg/kg/day to Beagle dogs (1 dog per sex and group at 15 and 75 
mg/kg/day and 2 dogs at 0 and 45 mg/kg/day) for 15 consecutive days. Then, repeated dose toxicity 
was evaluated in a GLP compliant study in Beagle dogs (n=3 per group and sex) that received 0, 5, 15, 
or 45 mg/kg/day for 8 consecutive weeks (study 14GR135).  
Finally, two GLP-compliant pivotal 9-months repeated dose toxicity studies were submitted (the second 
study was submitted to test the reproducibility of the critical ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophies in 
dogs exposed to ritlecitinib for 9 months, vide infra). In the first pivotal dog repeated dose toxicity 
study 20070068, ritlecitinib was administered to Beagle dogs (n=4 per main phase group and sex) at 
0, 5, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day for 9 consecutive months. Recovery of effects in the vehicle and the 
highest dose groups was studied for 3 dosing-free months (n=2 per group and sex). Finally, in the 
follow-up pivotal dog repeated dose toxicity study 20099163, ritlecitinib was administered to Beagle 
dogs (n=4 per group and sex in the main dosing phase) at 0, 10, 20 q.d., 20 b.i.d. (two times 10 
mg/kg/day approximately 6 hours apart), and 40 mg/kg/day for 9 consecutive months. Recovery was 
examined in additional groups (n=3 per group and sex) at 0, 20 q.d. and 40 mg/kg/day for 6 months.  
Rats 
In rats, repeated dose administration of ritlecitinib was generally well tolerated. 
In terms of test-article-related effects in rats pertaining to the pharmacology of ritlecitinib, decreased 
peripheral counts of white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were 
commonly observed. Similarly, considerable dose-dependent organ weight decreases, and macroscopic 
organ size decreases were noted for the thymus and/or the spleen, correlating with dose-dependent 
decreases in lymphoid cellularity in these organs. Decreased lymphoid cellularity was also commonly 
observed in lymph nodes (mesenteric, inguinal), GALT, and bone marrow. These effects were 
commonly observed down to the lowest applied dosing regimens. In addition, these (exaggerated) 
pharmacology effects commonly resulted in secondary effects that are presumably also related to the 
immunosuppressive mode of action of ritlecitinib, e.g. decreased globulin levels, decreased 
hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow, and increases in peripheral neutrophil counts. In study 
20070067, all ritlecitinib-related findings pertaining to exaggerated pharmacology proved to be fully 
reversible after 3 month of dosing cessation.  
In terms of off-target effects of ritlecitinib in rat repeated dose toxicity studies, decreases in body 
weight and body weight gain, and decreases in food consumption were commonly observed. 
Alterations in body weight largely reversed after 3 months of recovery in study 20070067. In study 
14GR132, 400 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib proved to be above the maximal tolerated dose, as severe 
morbidities (e.g. poor clinical condition, failure to gain body weight, increases in peripheral neutrophils 
and monocytes, gastrointestinal mucosa inflammation) and cases of mortality were identified.  
Additionally, in the 8 weeks and the 6 months rats repeated dose toxicity studies, ritlecitinib-related 
alterations of erythrocyte endpoints were observed in the high-exposure groups. Specifically, 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 40/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
microscopic erythrocyte abnormalities (poikilocytosis, eccentrocytes and pyknocytes), a higher red cell 
distribution width and an increase of reticulocytes were observed at 175 mg/kg/day in study 14GR132. 
In study 20070067, a lower red blood cell mass at ≥100 mg/kg/day, a higher mean corpuscular 
volume and red cell distribution width at 200 mg/kg/day, minimally higher absolute reticulocyte counts 
at ≥100 mg/kg/day, poikilocytosis (specifically eccentrocytes and pyknocytes) and hypochromasia at 
200 mg/kg/day were observed. Of note, poikilocytosis was also observed in male rats of the impurity 
qualification study 8413430. Eccentrocytes are RBCs that appear in a peripheral blood smear to have 
their haemoglobin shifted to one side of the cell (Caldin et al. 2005). Pyknocytes are small erythrocytes 
(occasionally with atypical membrane projections) resulting from the removal of damaged membranes 
from eccentrocytes.  
Furthermore, other minor ritlecitinib-related alterations were frequently observed in the rat repeated 
dose toxicity studies. Specifically, decreases in mean serum potassium, cholesterol, AST, triglyceride 
and glucose levels were observed in one or in both of the long-term rat studies 14GR132 and 
20070067. These mostly did not follow a dose-response and were of minor magnitude; therefore, no 
concern was raised on these test-article related alterations.  
In addition, in the rat repeated dose toxicity study 14GR132, ritlecitinib-related increases in urine 
volumes were observed at 75 and 175 mg/kg/day. Importantly, in the pivotal rat study 20070067, 
proteinuria was identified in rats at ≥50 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib. Even after 3 months of recovery, the 
identified proteinuria did not fully reverse at 200 mg/kg/day. Also in the impurity qualification study 
8413430, similar cases of proteinuria were identified, demonstrating reproducibility. These cases of 
proteinuria were correlated with microscopic incidences of hyaline droplet accumulation in renal tubular 
epithelial cells of ritlecitinib-treated rats (in study 20070067 in males from 50 mg/kg/day and in 
females from 100 mg/kg/day onwards). These droplets stained positive for lipofuscin or alpha2μ-
globulin. While the latter is a common response to high exposures of xenobiotics in male rats, renal 
lipofuscin droplets are uncommon. Similar renal droplets were occasionally identified in the 8 weeks rat 
study 14GR132, the impurity qualification Study 8413430, and in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity Study 
8384525. Of note, the ritlecitinib-related renal hyaline droplets in rats proved to fully reverse after 3 
months of recovery in study 20070067.  
Importantly, in the micronucleus assessment that was incorporated in the rat Study 14GR132, no 
ritlecitinib-related signs of clastogenicity or aneugenicity were observed. 
Finally, the toxicokinetics investigations in rat repeated dose toxicity studies generally demonstrated 
rapid Tmax values at approximately 1 to 1.4 hours post-dose. This supports rapid enteral absorption of 
ritlecitinib in rats. Furthermore, Cmax values mostly increased approximately dose-proportionally, 
while AUC24 mostly increased greater than dose-proportionally. No sex-related differences in 
toxicokinetics were observed in the submitted rat studies.  
Dogs 
In dogs, a range of potentially worrisome ritlecitinib-related on-target and off-target effects were 
identified. 
As already observed in the submitted rat repeated dose toxicity studies, similar test-article-related 
effects pertaining to the immunosuppressive mode of action of ritlecitinib were identified in Beagle dog 
studies 13LJ111, 14GR135, 20070068 and 20099163. Specifically, decreased counts of peripheral total 
white blood cells, lymphocytes (total T cells, T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, NK cells and B cells), 
basophils and eosinophils were associated with the administration of ritlecitinib and were generally 
observed in all test-article groups. Furthermore, ritlecitinib-related alterations of immune organs 
ranged from decreased organ weights (of especially the thymus) and macroscopically small thymi to 
decreased lymphoid cellularity in the thymus, the spleen, (mesenteric and popliteal) lymph nodes, and 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 41/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the GALT. These alterations generally followed a dose-response relationship. Similarly, as observed in 
the rat repeated dose toxicity studies, also in Beagle dog studies, decreased cellularities of all lineages 
were observed in the (sternal) bone marrow. These are (similarly as in the rat) presumed to be related 
to the pharmacological mode of action of ritlecitinib. Note that these exaggerated pharmacology 
findings proved to partially or fully reverse during the recovery periods implemented in the dog studies 
20070068 and 20099163.  
Importantly, however, in the two pivotal dog repeated dose toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163, 
adverse over-immunosuppression was observed at high supra-therapeutic doses at 20 (q.d. and 2x10 
b.i.d.) mg/kd/day and at 40 mg/kg/day, which was manifested by systemic skin infections. 
Specifically, generalised red skin, skin papules, thin fur and interdigital cysts as well as marked 
microscopic hyperplasia of the epidermis were observed. In affected dogs, the observed opportunistic 
skin (and sometimes ear) infections were, according to the applicant, triggered by Demodex mites 
and/or papilloma viruses. Of note, these infections even progressed in severity over the cessation of 
the treatment period, required up to several months of dosing cessation for partial or full recovery, and 
demanded veterinary care (with both an antiparasitic agent and a broad-spectrum antibiotic). While 
the observed over-immunosuppression pertains to the pharmacological mode of action of ritlecitinib, 
the extent and the inefficient recovery (in selected cases not even 6 months sufficed for total recovery) 
of this finding in the dog studies 20070068 and 20099163 were still unexpected. This is further 
elaborated in the discussion section below.  
According to the microscopic findings report from study 20070068, Demodex was only presumed in 
males, while in the affected females, parasites were not observed. In addition, it is reported that no 
ectoparasites were found following a deep skin scrapings procedure performed by the DVM (animals 
6992/M, 6993/M, 6998/F, 6999/F). In the confirmatory study 20099163, similar clinical signs were 
found. The appointed DVM treated the affected animals, but no antiparasitic drug was administered. 
No data on skin scrapings were found in the study report. In the pathology report, viral inclusions were 
found (Papilloma virus). However, it is not considered likely that Papilloma virus could solely cause the 
observed effects. In addition, dogs were received from Marshall BioResurces – according to health 
monitoring reports these beagles should be free from subclinical infestation with Demodex mites.  
Considering these facts, there is no clear evidence of Demodex being the core reason for skin findings. 
General skin inflammation is present with no clear cause at this time point. This is further elaborated 
upon in the discussion section below. 
In addition to test-article-related exaggerated pharmacology, also increases in neutrophils, platelets 
and fibrinogen were observed in the dog studies 20070068 and 20099163. These changes might be 
connected with the observed immunosuppression and concomitant (opportunistic) infections and could 
therefore be a secondary manifestation of exaggerated pharmacology. Note that these findings also 
proved to be completely reversible after the recovery phases in both studies. Because of these aspects 
and the small magnitude of these alterations, no concern was raised. 
In terms of off-target effects in Beagle dogs related to ritlecitinib administration, the applicant 
occasionally observed test-article-related emesis and mucoid/discoloured faeces that were considered 
non-adverse. Furthermore, ritlecitinib-related decreases in body weight and body weight gains (up to 
conditions necessitating feed supplementation) were observed. This condition correlated with 
decreased food consumption and with the clinically apparent thin condition of dogs at high dosing 
regimens. However, these test-article-related clinical effects proved to reverse during the recovery 
periods of the dog studies 20070068 and 20099163.  
Additionally, a range of test-article-related haematological and clinical chemistry alterations were 
identified in the submitted dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163. Similarly, as observed in the 
rat, also in dogs, erythrocyte endpoints were altered after chronic administration of ritlecitinib. 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

Specifically, decreases in RBCs, haemoglobin, haematocrit and reticulocytes were observed. Also, 
increases in red cell distribution width were noted. However, no poikilocytosis was observed in this 
study (as was observed in the preceding rat repeated dose toxicity studies). It might be presumed that 
these erythrocytic alterations are based on a similar ritlecitinib-related effect as observed in the 
submitted rat repeated dose toxicity studies. In terms of clinical chemistry, test-article-related 
decreases in phosphorous, calcium, total cholesterol and serum creatinine as well as increases in 
fibrinogen and globulin, were observed in dogs. As many of these findings followed no dose-response 
relationship, as the findings were not considered adverse, and as these findings were not clearly 
observed in the preceding rat repeated dose toxicity studies, no concern was raised. Of note, these 
haematology and clinical chemistry findings in dogs proved to be completely reversible after cessation 
of ritlecitinib administration. Finally, in study 20099163, AST levels were frequently increased 
(statistically significant) in test-article group animals, and this often followed a dose-response 
relationship. However, as no microscopic signs of hepatotoxicity were noted, no concern was raised. 
Finally, the applicant observed ritlecitinib-related decreases in albumin and the albumin/globulin ratio 
in the pivotal dog studies 20070068 and 20099163. The applicant speculates that these decreases 
were related to the infections of dogs affected by over-immunosuppression. This notion is supported.  
An increased incidence and severity of mixed cell perivascular/alveolar infiltrations in the lungs was 
observed in test article groups in both pivotal dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163; in the 
latter study, this finding was already identified from the lowest ritlecitinib groups onwards. 
Furthermore, also (non-adverse) pinpoint pale foci with or without microscopic correlate (mixed cell 
infiltration) were observed in the post-mortem investigations in animals of the highest dose groups. 
The applicant similarly hypothesises that these alterations were secondary to ritlecitinib-related over-
immunosuppression and were a sign of infection. In the dog study 20099163, test-article-related 
hypoplasia/atrophy of the seminiferous tubular epithelium and/or hypospermatogenesis were observed 
in animals of all test-article groups. Additionally, it appears that testis maturation in dogs of test-article 
groups was delayed, as the fraction of adolescent testes was increased in animals of most test-article 
groups, whereas all investigated testes of dogs of the control group were mature. While these findings 
did not follow a dose-response relationship, they were nonetheless only observed in dogs of test-article 
groups. Interestingly, also after 6 months of recovery, still cases of immature testes, 
hypoplasia/atrophy of the seminiferous tubular epithelium and hypospermatogenesis were observed in 
test-article group animals. Of note, no such alterations were observed in the preceding Beagle dog 
repeated dog toxicity study 20070068. The implications of these ritlecitinib-related alterations in the 
male genital tract in dogs in study 20099163 are further elaborated in the discussion section below. 
In both 9-month pivotal repeated dose dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163, ritlecitinib-
related widespread axonal dystrophy was observed in the CNS and PNS of treated dogs from 10 
mg/kg/day onwards. The microscopic correlate to these axonal dystrophies were “spheroids”, which 
are known to form in response to various degenerative triggers such as oxidative stress and neurotoxic 
molecules (i.e. disease-related proteins) (Yong et al. 2021). Overall, ritlecitinib-related axonal 
dystrophies were observed in the brainstem (e.g. in the superior olivary nucleus and the lateral 
lemniscus), cerebellum (specifically in the cerebellar rostral vermis), sciatic nerve, branches of the 
vagus nerve that innervate multiple visceral organs and the mesenteric and submucosal plexuses of 
the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and urinary bladder. Furthermore, axonal dystrophies were found in 
autonomic nerves of the adrenal gland in animals of the 20 mg/kg/day q.d. group (study 20099163). 
In most examined dog CNS and PNS specimens, ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophies were observed 
from 20 mg/kg/day onwards. However, importantly, also clear increases in axonal dystrophies in 
investigated specimens of the cerebellar vermis (in 100% of the investigated animals per sex, n=4) 
were already observed at 10 mg/kg/day in study 20099163. In the Table 2 below, incidences of axonal

dystrophies in the cerebellar rostral vermis from 10 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib onwards in study 20099163 
are summarised: 
Table 2: Group incidences (with severities) of test article-related microscopic findings in the dog brain 
in Study 20099163 
Furthermore, the following Table 3 summarises axonal dystrophies in harvested dog brain tissues 
(superior olivary nucleus and lateral lemniscus and/or ventral nucleus) from the dog study 20099163: 
Table 3: Group incidences (with severities) of test article-related microscopic findings in the dog brain 
in Study 20099163 
Importantly, the test-article-related axonal dystrophies in the brain stem (especially in the superior 
olivary nucleus) also led to severe functional impairments. This was demonstrated in BAEP (brainstem 
auditory evoked potential) investigations of dogs affected by ritlecitinib-mediated axonal dystrophies. 
Mild to severe hearing capacity loss and waveform defects was detected in BAEP investigations of 
animals at 40 mg/kg/day in both dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163. Contrarily, no 
abnormalities of the tested BAEPs were identified in control animals. Additionally, statistically 
significant shorter mean latency to wave I and V at 46 and/or 82 db was observed in animals from the 
10 mg/kg/day groups onwards in study 20099163. The applicant considered these BAEP alterations in 
affected dogs test-article related and adverse. Examples of ritlecitinib-mediated alterations in the BAEP 
investigations of study 20099163 is demonstrated in the Figure 4 and Figure 5 below:

The first 5 seconds of the BAEP include a complex set of waves reflecting activity ranging from of the 
cochlea (Wave I) to the olivary complex (Waves IV and V)

40 dB). Note the reduced amplitude, but the presence, of Waves I-III, and the virtual absence of the 
later responses (Waves IV-V) 
Importantly, the ritlecitinib-related BAEP alterations and the identified axonal dystrophies in the 
nervous system in dogs showed full (BAEP) or partial (axonal dystrophies) reversibility after 6 months 
of recovery. Regarding the latter, incomplete recovery from axonal dystrophies was noted for the 
lateral lemniscus, the lateral superior olivary nucleus and the rostral vermis in the cerebellum. 
Specifically, for the lateral lemniscus, spheroids were still observed in one animal of the 20 and 40 
mg/kg/day groups in males and in the 40 mg/kg/day group in one female, in the lateral superior 
olivary nucleus in one male and female of the 40 mg/kg/day group, and in the rostral cerebellar vermis 
in one female animal of the mg/kg/day group. Therefore, the applicant’s notion that full recovery of 
axonal dystrophies was observed apart from the rostral cerebellar vermis is not supported.  
According to the applicant, the margins between the clinical exposure and the exposures in the lowest 
dose group at which ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophies were observed (rostral cerebellar vermis at 
10 mg/kg/day, study 20099163) are only 6.0-fold in terms of Cmax and 7.4-fold in terms of AUC24. 
Importantly, in the second pivotal 9-month dog toxicity study 20099163, axonal dystrophies were 
observed at all applied dose levels, rendering the possibility that even at lower exposure multiples to 
the clinically anticipated exposure axonal dystrophies might be formed.  
In the frame of the Beagle dog study 20070068, the applicant also conducted transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) investigations of superior olivary (SON) and cochlear nucleus specimens from dogs 
of the dosing- and recovery phase to investigate the identified ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophies 
more specifically. In SON specimens from the end of the dosing phase of the 40 mg/kg/day group 
(n=2), axosomatic bouton enlargements were frequently found. However, no such alterations were 
found in one of the control dogs after the dosing phase had ended (n=1). Of note, synapses between 
these bouton enlargements were still intact. Importantly, after recovery (3 months), no bouton 
enlargements were found in brain specimens of dogs of the 40 mg/kg/day groups, demonstrating the 
reversibility of this finding. Interestingly, the applicant also describes that in the TEM investigation of 
Assessment report

Page 45/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dog brains at 40 mg/kg/day, poorly demarcated non-membrane bound oval to spherical structures 
were observed which were moderately electron-dense, either single or merged and with a homogenous 
internal appearance without further visible internal organisation. Furthermore, one of the brain 
sections examined ultra-structurally from 1 of the 2 dogs administered 40 mg/kg/day at the end of the 
dosing phase had 1 instance of a well-demarcated irregularly shaped membrane-bound electron dense 
focus of compacted rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.  
Finally, in terms of toxicokinetics in Beagle dogs, Tmax was attained at approximately 1-hour post-
dose in the dog toxicity studies, supporting rapid enteral absorption of ritlecitinib after oral 
administration. Cmax generally increased dose-proportionally, while AUC24 generally increased greater 
than dose-proportionally. No sex differences were noted.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In total, three in vitro genotoxicity studies were submitted. Specifically, a GLP-compliant bacterial 
reverse mutation assay (Ames test, study WIL-655100), a GLP-compliant in vitro micronucleus test in 
TK6 cells (a human lymphoblast cell line, study WIL-655099), and a non-GLP compliant mechanistic 
follow up study to this in vitro micronucleus assays in TK6 cells (study 13GTX10) were submitted. Note 
that an in vivo micronucleus evaluation was included in the 8 weeks rat repeated dose toxicity study 
14GR132 (vide supra).  
Ritlecitinib proved to be negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. In the in vitro micronucleus 
study WIL-655099, a statistically significant increase in micronucleated cells was observed without 
metabolic activation at the highest concentration of this study (125 μg/mL, or 437 μM). In the follow-
up study 13GTX10, the applicant found that ritlecitinib did not cause clastogenicity, but caused 
aneugenicity (hypodiploidy, hyperdiploidy and polyploidy) at concentrations from at 90.8 to 669 μM at 
incubations for 27 hours. While ritlecitinib was unequivocally an in vitro aneugen, the in vivo relevance 
of this finding is considered to be low, especially as aneugenicity is generally considered to be a 
threshold effect and as in vitro aneugenicity was only observed at exceedingly high supra-therapeutic 
exposures. This notion was supported by the in vivo micronucleus rat study 14GR132, in which no 
increases in micronucleated cells were observed in test-article groups at relevant exposures. This is 
substantiated by the fact that even at 400 mg/kg/day in study 14GR132 (corresponding to an 
exposure that is 130-fold higher than the expectable clinical exposure in terms of unbound AUC24), no 
increase in peripheral micronucleated cells was observed. The applicant considers  that ritlecitinib – at 
high doses – functionally inhibited kinases that are involved in mitosis, which subsequently led to in 
vitro aneugenicity. Importantly, this constitutes another example of an off-target protein reaction by 
ritlecitinib with subsequent impairment of protein function. 
Finally, no signs of genotoxic carcinogenicity were noted throughout the submitted dossier. While in 
study 8384525, benign and malignant neoplasms of the thymus (also one case of benign thymoma in 
the highest dose group of the dog study 20099163) and benign neoplasms of the thyroid gland were 
observed, these neoplasms were presumably not of genotoxic origin, and in the case of benign and 
malignant thymomas presumably related to the pharmacology of ritlecitinib. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
The applicant submitted an extensive carcinogenicity programme, consisting of the pivotal and GLP-
compliant rat 2 year carcinogenicity study 8384525 and the 0.5 year pivotal rasH2 transgenic mouse 
study 8400625. In addition, the applicant also performed two toxicity studies in the rasH2 transgenic 
mouse to examine tolerability (in the 2 week study 18GR117, non-GLP compliant) and dose range 
finding (in the 4 weeks study 8392586, GLP-compliant). The 2-year carcinogenicity study was 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 46/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted in Crl:WI(Han) rats (n=60 per group and sex) at 0, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib, 
whereas the 0.5 year study was performed in rasH2 transgenic mice (n=25 per group and sex) at 0, 
30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day. In the 0.5 year study, an appropriate positive control group was included. 
In the preceding rasH2 transgenic mouse tolerability study 18GR117, 0, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 
mg/kg/day ritlecitinib were administered to 12 mice per group and sex, whereas in the dose range 
finding study 8392586, 0, 75, 225 and 450 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib were administered to 10 mice per 
sex and group. Toxicokinetics were examined in these studies in appropriate satellite groups. 
While survival in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study was similar between control males and females at 
the end of the study (60% vs. 65%, respectively), % survival appeared clearly lower in male rats than 
in female rats (53%, 57% and 52% in males vs. 75%, 67% and 67% in females at 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg/day, respectively). However, upon request, the applicant submitted a statistical analysis in 
which this difference in survival was only statistically significant at the lowest dose level of ritlecitinib. 
Additional ritlecitinib-related clinical findings were decreases in body weight and thin appearances. 
Interestingly, increases in parasites were observed in the colon of animals treated with ritlecitinib (in 
females approximately dose-dependent). Similarly, as the observed systemic skin infections by 
opportunistic pathogens in the dog repeated dose toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163, this 
finding presumably results from ritlecitinib-mediated immunosuppression.  
Similarly, as observed in the rat repeated dose toxicity studies, in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study 
8384525, ritlecitinib-related findings pertaining to exaggerated pharmacology were also identified. 
These included decreased lymphoid cellularities in the thymus, the spleen and the mesenteric lymph 
node at 100 mg/kg/day. In addition, lipofuscin depositions were identified in the kidneys of animals 
treated with ritlecitinib (as was also observed in preceding rat repeated dose toxicity studies, vide 
supra).  
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study 8384525, significantly increased incidences of benign thymomas 
were observed in male and female rats at 100 mg/kg/day. Increased incidences of thymus hyperplasia 
were also observed in female rats at 100 mg/kg/day. Importantly, however, also malignant thymomas 
were observed in this study; specifically, 1 male at 100 mg/kg/day, 1 female at 30 mg/kg/day and 2 
females at 100 mg/kg/day were affected. At least one of the malignant thymomas in one of the 
affected females at 100 mg/kg/day also metastasised, as apparent by malignant thymoma metastases 
found in the heart of the affected animal. While these data hint at a dose-response relationship in 
females, these low incidences were not statistically significant due to the limited group size in this 
study.  
Interestingly, in a comparative study of data from long-term studies in the National Toxicology 
Program database, the incidence of malignant thymomas of all identified thymoma cases in Wistar Han 
rats (n=129) was only 2%, 98% of the identified thymomas were benign (Moore et al. 2019). 
However, clearly higher ratios of malignant thymomas out of all identified thymomas per affected 
group were identified in study 8384525 (specifically, 1 out of 8 thymomas in males at 100 mg/kg/day 
= 12.5%; 1 out of 15 thymomas in females at 30 mg/kg/day = 6.15%; and 2 out of 18 thymomas in 
females at 100 mg/kg/day = 11.1%). Furthermore, Taylor and Mowat 2020 described that out of 860 
male and 871 female control Crl:WI(Han) rats, only 2 males and 5 females had malignant thymomas, 
resulting in incidences of 0.23% and 0.57%, respectively. The incidences in study 8384525 were, 
however, clearly higher, amounting to 1.89% in males of the 100 mg/kg/day group (1 out of 53 
animals), to 1.72% in females of the 30 mg/kg/day group (1 out of 58 animals), and to 3.57% in 
females of the 100 mg/kg/day group (2 out of 56 animals). These translate into 8.2-fold, 3.0-fold and 
6.3-fold increases over the incidences described in the Taylor and Mowat 2020 study. Finally, and most 
importantly, in the historical database of control Crl:WI(Han) rats used in study 8384525, not a single 
malignant thymoma was identified in 543 control males (0.0%), and only 1 malignant thymoma was 
observed in 574 control females (0.18%). Therefore, the incidence of malignant thymomas in females 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 47/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the 30 (1 out of 58 animals = 1.72%) and 100 mg/kg/day (2 out of 56 animals = 3.57%) groups in 
study 8384525 were 9.6-fold and 19.8-fold higher than in the historical control database of the CRO in 
which the study was conducted.  
In addition to thymomas, a statistically significantly increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was 
observed in males in study 8384525 at 100 mg/kg/day (specifically, 19 out of 59 animals were 
affected). Of note, the incidences of benign thyroid adenomas also increased dose proportionally from 
11.7% (vehicle group) to 20.0% (10 mg/kg/day), 21.7% (30 mg/kg/day) and 32.2% (100 mg/kg/day) 
in males, and from 3.3% (vehicle group) to 6.7% (10 and 30 mg/kg/day) to 10.0% (100 mg/kg/day) 
in females. No clear trends in thyroid carcinomas were identified. Additionally, a slight trend of 
increasing severities (males) or increasing incidences (females) of thyroid hyperplasias was observed 
in test-article groups. The applicant considers that these increased thyroid adenoma incidences are an 
exacerbation of these common background tumours in rats due to ritlecitinib-mediated 
immunosuppression. 
In the 6-month hemizygous rasH2 transgenic (tg/wt) Study 8400625, no test-article related neoplasms 
were observed. The validity of this study was demonstrated by the included positive control group. 
Interestingly, no decreased lymphoid cellularities or organ weights were observed in the thymus and 
the spleen, even though these were observed in all preceding mouse, rat, and dog repeated dose 
toxicity studies.   
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In terms of reproductive and developmental toxicity, the applicant submitted 6 studies. Specifically, in 
the GLP-compliant fertility and early embryonic development until development (FEED) study 
00655209, ritlecitinib was administered to Wistar rats (n=20 per sex and group) at 0, 20, 60 and 200 
mg/kg/day, whereby breeding was initiated between non-dosed naïve animals and dosed animals. 
Specifically, male rats received ritlecitinib (or vehicle) for 28 days or 84 days prior to mating, and 
dosing in females started 14 days before initiation of mating, was continued during mating, and lasted 
until gestation day (GD) 7. In terms of embryo-fetal toxicity (EFD), non-GLP compliant dose-finding 
studies were conducted with Wistar Han rats (receiving 0, 75, 175 and 325 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib 
between GD 6 to 17 at n=6 animals per group; study 20069224) and NZW rabbits (receiving 0, 10, 
75, 175, or 325 mg/kg/day between GD 7 to 19 at n=6 animals per group; study 20069228). Pivotal 
GLP-compliant studies were then similarly conducted in Wistar Han rats (receiving 0, 75, 175, and 325 
mg/kg/day ritlecitinib between GD 6 to 17 at n=22 animals per group; study 20075271) and NZW 
rabbits (receiving 0, 5, 25 and 75 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib between GD 7 to 19 at n=20 animals per 
group; study 20075272). Pre- and postnatal natal development (PPND) was investigated in study 
00655232, in which ritlecitinib was administered at 0, 25, 75 and 175 mg/kg/day from GD 6 until 
lactation day (LD) 20. In the postnatal part of this study, 1 male and 1 female/litter from the F1 
generation were randomly selected prior to weaning (at PND 4) for postnatal evaluation of vaginal 
patency (PND 25 onwards), balanopreputional separation (PND 35 onwards), auditory startle response 
(PND 60), locomotor activity (PND 61), learning and memory (using a water-filled 8-unit T-maze; PND 
62) and breeding (minimum age of PND 85). Scheduled euthanasias were at either LD 21 (F0 
mothers), PND 21 (pre-weaning F1 litters), PND 115-120 (post-weaning F1 males) or GD 14 (F1 post-
weaning females). Adequate toxicokinetics investigations were included in these six studies. Finally, 
ritlecitinib was administered to Wistar Han rats in a juvenile toxicity study (study 00655269) once daily 
at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day from post-natal day (PND) 10 until PND60. In this study, a 2-month 
dose-free phase was additionally examined in a subset of animals. Appropriate toxicokinetics satellite 
groups were included in this juvenile toxicity study. Apart from the regular battery of investigations, 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 48/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also landmarks of reproductive development, neurobehavior, and femur length were examined in this 
study. 
In terms of FEED, no effects on male reproductive performance (mating and copulation) were 
detected. However, an adverse increase in mean litter proportion of pre-implantation loss in test-article 
naïve females that were mated with test-article treated males was detected after the first and second 
breeding phases. Specifically, an approximately 10-fold increased pre-implantation loss was noted in 
females that were sired by males of the 200 mg/kg/day group in relation to the vehicle group (20.2% 
vs. 2.0%, respectively) after the first mating phase, and an approximately 5.2-fold increase in pre-
implantation loss in the same groups after the second breeding phase (27.1% vs. 5.2%, respectively). 
Secondary to the ritlecitinib-related pre-implantation loss, the mean implantation sites and the mean 
number of viable embryos were lower than in ritlecitinib-naïve females sired by males from the 200 
mg/kg/day group as from males of the vehicle group. Apart from these findings, no test-article-related 
effects on sperm endpoints (counts, motility and morphology) or male organ weights were detected. It 
should be noted that also test-article related effects on male reproductive tract were detected in the 
Beagle dog repeated dose toxicity study 20099163 (as described before). These aspects are further 
elaborated in the non-clinical discussion section of this document (vide supra). Of note, clinical safety 
margins to the male fertility NOAEL established in the FEED study 00655209 were 14-fold based on 
unbound AUC24, and 23-fold based on unbound Cmax.   
No relevant effects on female fertility and early embryonic development until implantation were 
detected when test-article treated females were mated with test-article naïve males in the FEED study 
00655209. 
In the pivotal rat EFD study, mean foetal body weights (sexes combined) were decreased in the 175 
and 325 mg/kg/day groups (specifically 0.94 and 0.80-fold in respect to the control groups). 
Furthermore, the applicant identified test-article-related malformations and variations at 175 and/or 
325 mg/kg/day that followed a dose-response relationship (i.e. malformed vertebrae and ribs and 
variations in the development of the digits, vertebrae (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar), ribs, and 
sternebrae). Specifically, one foetus with skeletal malformations of the vertebrae and/or ribs was 
identified in the 175 mg/kg/day group, and 3 foetuses had such malformations in the 325 mg/kg/day 
group. In the pivotal rabbit EFD study 20075272, in the highest dose group at 75 mg/kg/day, a test-
article-related increase in post-implantation loss was noted (13.08% compared with 8.25% in 
controls). Furthermore, ritlecitinib-related visceral malformations in 3 fetuses of the 75 mg/kg/day 
group (mal-positioned kidneys), and skeletal malformations in 3 fetuses (malformed vertebrae and 
sternebrae) of the 75 mg/kg/day group, were identified. The incidence of malformed kidneys might 
have followed a dose-response relationship and was identified in 1 fetus of the 5 and 25 mg/kg/day 
groups and 3 fetuses of the 75 mg/kg/day groups. Additionally, in the 75 mg/kg/day group of study 
20075272, an increased incidence of test-article-related variations was identified, specifically 
ossification delays (digits, pubes, skull, thoracic vertebrae, and sternebrae) and variations in the 
development of the skull and vertebrae.  
Overall, ritlecitinib proved to be a developmental toxicant in gestating Wistar Han rats (study 
20075271) and NZW rabbits (study 20075272), with identified test-article-related cases of visceral and 
skeletal fetal malformations, fetal skeletal variations, decreased fetal body weights and post-
implantation losses. Safety margins from animal studies at the claimed no observed adverse effect 
levels to clinical exposures only ranged between 12 and 24-fold. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant 
issued a contra-indication for pregnancy in the SmPC section 4.3. 
In regard to PPND (study 00655232), ritlecitinib-related increases in pups that were found dead or 
were missing (presumably due to cannibalisation) were detected in the 175 mg/kg/day group 
compared to the control group (e.g. 14(7) vs. 2 (1) pup(litters) were found dead, and 20 (8) vs. 3 (2) 
Assessment report

and pups (litters) were missing, respectively). Furthermore, an adverse effect of ritlecitinib on post-
natal survival in the highest dose group at 175 mg/kg/day was noted between post-natal day (PND) 1-
4 (93.7% in the 175 mg/kg/day group vs. 99.6% in the control group) and PND 4-7 (95.5% in the 175 
mg/kg/day group vs. 99.4% in the control group). Additionally, ritlecitinib-related effects in the F1 
generation of the 175 mg/kg/day group included decreased male and female pup birth weight at PND 1 
(0.82-fold and 0.80-fold of the control group, respectively) and statistically significantly decreased 
body weights and body weight gains (up to decreases of 20%) in the 175 mg/kg/day group and 
frequently in the 75 mg/kg/day group throughout large parts of the post-natal development. Then, 
also test-article-related delayed sexual maturation was observed in the F1 generation at 175 
mg/kg/day. Statistically significantly increased times until balanopreputioal separation was noted in the 
25, 75 and 175 mg/kg/day groups, amounting to 45.8, 46.4 and 47.4 days, respectively, compared to 
43.8 days in the control group. Similarly, attainment of vaginal patency was delayed in females of the 
175 mg/kg/day group (37.8 days vs. 34.0 days in the vehicle group). Finally, F1 females demonstrated 
an adverse test-article-related decrease in corpus lutea numbers at 175 mg/kg/day (12.6 vs. 14.2 per 
dam in the vehicle group, respectively). This led to a decreased number of implantation sites and 
viable embryos per dam in the high dose group compared to the vehicle control group (11.0 vs. 13.3 
implantation sites and 10.5 vs. 12.5 viable embryos, respectively). Of note, the exposure at the 
claimed NOAEL of this study at 75 mg/kg/day in rats relates to a clinical safety margin of 14-fold in 
terms of unbound AUC24, and to 25-fold in terms of unbound Cmax. Upon CHMP’s request, the 
applicant agreed to issue a contra-indication for breast-feeding in the SmPC section 4.3, also see the 
discussion on non-clinical aspects.  
In the juvenile rat toxicity study 00655269, administration of ritlecitinib to juvenile rats led to an 
adverse lower mean body weight gain (with a corresponding decreased food consumption) at 100 
mg/kg/day in males during the dosing phase. Also at lower dose levels, decreases in mean body 
weight were noted that also occasionally proved to be statistically significant. These translated into 
lower mean body weights and lower food consumption, mainly at 100 mg/kg/day, but also at lower 
dosing regimens. Of note, this condition partly or fully reversed during the recovery period in the 
affected animals. Decreases in mean body weights, mean body weight gains and mean food 
consumption were only considered adverse in males' 100 mg/kg/day doses. Secondary to these 
alterations, the age of balanopreputial separation in males at 100 mg/kg/day was delayed by two days 
as compared to the control group. Also, femur length differences were noted in males at 100 
mg/kg/day after the dosing and recovery phases. However, the applicant considers these effects 
secondary to the observed decrease in mean body weight and weight gain in this group. This 
hypothesis is supported because no alterations of femur length were observed in females at the same 
dosing regimen and because no particular macroscopic or microscopic abnormalities were associated 
with this finding. Importantly, no ritlecitinib-related neurological and skeletal alterations were 
recognised in this study. 
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were submitted. As Litfulo will be administered orally, this is acceptable. 
2.5.4.7.  Other toxicity studies 
No antigenicity studies were submitted. This is acceptable.   
In terms of immunotoxicity, one dedicated immunogenicity / antigenicity study was submitted, 
specifically a mouse allergy model with the purpose of determining whether ritlecitinib administration 
Assessment report

Page 50/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can lead to hypersensitivity reactions due to covalent binding to off-target proteins with subsequent 
haptenisation.  
In the mouse allergy model of study 14GR446, no ritlecitinib-mediated hypersensitivity was observed.  
In terms of dependence, no studies were submitted. However, the applicant summarised that the 
primary pharmacology of ritlecitinib is not associated with molecular pathways liable for dependency 
and that secondary pharmacology studies did not demonstrate activity towards relevant targets that 
induce dependency. Additionally, the applicant concluded that no test-article effects on functional 
observational batteries were observed in the conducted non-clinical studies. The applicant’s positions 
are supported. 
No non-clinical safety studies with metabolites were submitted. The applicant summarised that the 
most important metabolites of ritlecitinib are presumably of lower risk concern, as many of them are 
conjugate metabolites and are of little toxicological concern. This was explained because their 
pharmacology potential was considerably decreased regarding ritlecitinib because CNS penetration of 
these metabolites is very low and because the metabolites of ritlecitinib show an unproblematic in silico 
profile in Derek and Sarah Nexus predictions. This is supported; no studies are needed. 
In total, 15 non-clinical impurity qualification studies were submitted. At first, in the GLP-compliant 
study 8413430, male and female Crl: WI(Han) rats (10 animals per group and sex) received batches of 
ritlecitinib at 0 and 200 mg/kg/day for 13 consecutive weeks that either were pure or that were 
blended with impurities (at a total extent of 4.37%). Note that five impurities (PF-06763318, PF-
06757444, PF-06837196, PF-07103942 and PF-06763172) are specified above their respective ICH 
Q3A/Q3B qualification thresholds and that these impurities consequently demanded non-clinical 
qualification. In the ritlecitinib batch used in study 8413430 these impurities were concentrated at 
levels higher than their intended qualification threshold. In addition, 11 non-GLP compliant exploratory 
bacterial reverse mutation assays were submitted (studies 20GR280, 20GR189, 20GR190, 20GR191, 
20GR192, 20GR139, 20GR140, 19GR162, 15GR004, 14GR556 and 21GR240 for the impurities PF-
07313152/PF-07313153, PF-07226176, PF-07226177, PF-07268908, PF-07268909, PF-07299318, PF-
07268909, PF-01403876, PF-06837196, PF-06757444 and PF-07308030, respectively). Finally, 3 GLP-
compliant bacterial reverse mutation assays (studies 20232598, 20232562 and 1149304 for the 
impurities PF-06715298, PF-07202371-S7 and CP-902684, respectively) were submitted.  
In the in vivo rat study 8413430, no relevant differences between batches of ritlecitinib with or without 
impurities were observed when rats were administered 200 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib for a consecutive 
period of 13 weeks. In the exploratory reverse bacterial mutation (Ames) assays, only PF-07299318 
and PF-07308030 (a potential N-nitrosamine impurity of ritlecitinib) proved to be bacterial mutagens. 
The necessary control strategy of these impurities is discussed in the quality section. 
For the (potential) impurities PF-07812857, PF-07812862, PF-07256812, PF-07243943 and PF-
07289082, the applicant obtained either equivocal or even positive Sarah Nexus calls for bacterial 
mutagenicity (Sarah Nexus is a statistically-based prediction software used for predicting bacterial 
mutagenicity). According to the ICH M7(R1), these impurities would classify as class 3 impurities that 
need to be controlled below the TTC of 1.5 µg/day. However, for these 5 impurities, no Ames test data 
were submitted. Instead, the applicant performed a read-across assessment for these impurities (by 
using structurally similar compounds for which Ames test data were available) and concluded that 
these 5 impurities possess no mutagenic hazard and can therefore be classified as class 5 impurities. 
No detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) assessment was submitted that would allow to de-risk 
these untested impurities by already tested substances that share exactly the same structural alerts. 
However, an own Derek Nexus (recent version 2.5.2) SAR assessment supports that these 5 impurities 
can indeed be classified as class 4 impurities, as all their structural alerts were already contained in the 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

already negatively-tested impurities PF-07313153, PF-07313152, PF-06837196 and PF-01403876. 
Therefore, no non-clinical concern was raised about these impurities. 
Finally, also for the impurity PF-06685960, no reverse bacterial mutation assay was submitted. 
According to the applicant’s in silico predictions, this impurity had an equivocal Sarah Nexus call for 
bacterial mutagenicity. However, in an own Derek Nexus (recent version 2.5.2) prediction, this 
substance tested negative for bacterial mutagenicity. Consequently, this impurity can be considered a 
class 5 impurity and non-mutagenic. 
In addition, 5 non-GLP compliant mechanistic studies on the axonal dystrophy findings in the Beagle 
dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163 were submitted. Specifically, the goal of study 17GR131 
was to examine the plasma and brain tissue concentrations of ritlecitinib (superior olivary nucleus, 
cochlear nucleus and hippocampus) after oral gavage administration to female Beagle dogs (n=4 per 
group) at 0 and 40 mg/kg/day when administered for 3 consecutive days. Then, the objective of study 
19GR193 was to examine potential off-target proteins in the dog CNS that might be causally related to 
the observed axonal dystrophies identified in the 9-month repeated dose toxicity studies 20070068 
and 20099163. Specifically, a click chemistry-based chemoproteomic method was used to examine 
potential off-target proteins in Beagle dog (18-21 months old) brain tissue homogenates (hippocampus 
(n=5) and rostral cerebellar vermis (n=3)). Furthermore, in study 19GR372, the applicant’s goal was 
to examine the binding affinities of ritlecitinib towards MAP2K7 in overexpressing HEK 293F cells (as 
the applicant identified MAP2K7 as a potential off-target of ritlecitinib in dog brain homogenates in the 
preceding study 19GR193). Then, in study 19GR142, the applicant’s goal was to examine the relative 
mRNA expression of different kinases and oxidative stress genes in brain regions of untreated male 
Beagle dog (approximately 4 years old) brain tissue (specifically, of the superior olivary nucleus vs. the 
cochlear nucleus and the hippocampus). This was to examine the hypothesis that differences in gene 
expression in the cochlear nucleus compared with the superior olivary nucleus in terms of differences 
in oxidative stress genes might have led to the observed axonal dystrophy in the superior olivary 
nucleus in the dog repeated dose toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163. Finally, in study 21GR164, 
the applicant’s objective was to examine DOCK10 expression in the cerebellum of humans, dogs, rats, 
and mice (as the applicant identified DOCK10 as a potential off-target of ritlecitinib in dog brain 
homogenates in the preceding study 19GR193). 
In study 17GR131, approximately 10% of the ritlecitinib plasma levels were detected in the superior 
olivary nucleus, cochlear nucleus and hippocampus (when normalised to ng/mL or ng/g). This study 
demonstrates that blood-brain barrier penetration of ritlecitinib in the Beagle dog is clearly higher than 
in the rat quantitative whole body autoradiography study 15647, in which after single dose 
administration a brain: plasma ratio of 4% was established. As metabolites of ritlecitinib also likely 
contributed to this signal (only radioactivity was measured, but not its exact source), the real blood-
brain barrier penetration of ritlecitinib might be smaller than 4%. Therefore, the dog is a more relevant 
species in determining the neurotoxic potential of ritlecitinib than the rat.   
In study 19GR193, potential off-target proteins of ritlecitinib in the hippocampus and the rostral 
cerebellar vermis were BTK, DOCK10, BMX and MAP2K7 (the latter only in the rostral cerebellar 
vermis). Of note, JAK3 was not among the identified off-targets in the investigated dog brain areas, 
suggesting that JAK3 is not involved in the ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophies in dogs. Furthermore, 
the applicant concludes that BTK and BMX (2 kinases of the TEC family) binding by ritlecitinib in the 
dog brain is unlikely the cause of the observed axonal dystrophies, as no similar neurological toxicities 
as noted with ritlecitinib were observed with dedicated TEC inhibitors. Interestingly, in the 
hippocampus homogenates and in the rostral cerebellar vermis homogenates in the dog study 
19GR193, also ritlecitinib-binding to Protein Kinase C (PKC) isoform was detected and proved 
statistically significant. As PKC signalling alterations are involved in neurodegenerative disease, this 
finding is further elaborated upon in the non-clinical discussion section of this report.  
Assessment report

In study 19GR372, binding affinities of ritlecitinib towards human, dog and rat versions of MAP2K7 in 
overexpressing HEK 293F cells proved to fall within a factor-2 range between the three species. Of 
note, dysfunction of MAP2K7 signalling is suspected to be correlated to the aetiology of neurological 
diseases such as schizophrenia (Winchester et al.); therefore, ritlecitinib-mediated inactivation of 
MAP2K7 might potentially be of neurological concern. This is further discussed in the discussion section 
below. In study 21GR164, the applicant found that expression (only on the mRNA level) of DOCK10 in 
the cerebellum of dog, rat, and mouse was significantly different and higher than expression in the 
human cerebellum.  
Finally, a GLP-compliant phototoxicity study in Crl: LE (Long-Evans) pigmented rats (n=5 per dose 
group) was submitted. Rats in this study received 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day ritlecitinib for 3 
consecutive days and were exposed to light in the UVA, UVB and VIS wavelength. Toxicokinetics were 
studied in satellite groups. No signs of dermal or ocular phototoxicity were observed in this study. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an extensive assessment in which the environmental risk of ritlecitinib was 
evaluated in phase I persistency and phase II tier A and B ecotoxicity and environmental fate studies. 
All submitted studies were conducted in GLP compliance and in line with relevant OECD guidelines. 
Specifically, a PBT phase I PBT screening was performed in study 260K-108. Then, in phase II tier A, a 
sludge die away study (study 260E-336, according to OECD 314B) and an adsorption study (adsorption 
to soils, sediments and activated sludge, study 260E-337) were carried out. In terms of environmental 
fate, the applicant conducted a 100 days water-sediment degradation study (study 260E-339) and a 
28-day surface-water and suspended sediment biodegradation study (study 260E-340) with 
radiolabelled ritlecitinib. In terms of ecotoxicity, the applicant submitted an activated sludge 
respiratory inhibition test (study 260E-341, according to OECD 209), a 72-hour toxicity study with 
fresh water green algae (study 260P-117, according to OECD 201), a daphnia toxicity test (study 
260A-275, according to OECD 211) and an early life-stage toxicity test with fish (study 260A-276, 
according to OECD 210). Finally, in phase II tier B, a prolonged sediment toxicity tests with the midge 
(Chironomus riparius) using spiked sediment was conducted (study 260A-280, according to OECD 
218).  
In the phase I PBT screening, log D values of ritlecitinib at pH 4, 7 and 9 were far below the trigger 
value of 4.5 (specifically, log D values were 0.45, 1.50 and 1.40, respectively). Therefore, no PBT 
assessment was warranted. However, the PECSW calculation resulted in a value of 0.25 µg/L, which 
clearly exceeds the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L, necessitating a phase II ERA. In the sludge die away 
study, ritlecitinib had a moderate biodegradation half-life of 1.1 days, and complete mineralisation 
after 28 days amounted to approximately 20%. Sorption to sludge was found to be negligible, 
therefore phase II studies in terrestrial environments were waived. Input into the environment was 
subsequently considered to mainly result by discharge of effluents from wastewater treatment 
facilities. In terms of environmental fate in the water-sediment compartment, the half-life of ritlecitinib 
ranged between 11.5 and 44 days, whereas complete mineralisation was inefficient (e.g. 3.5% in 100 
days). Importantly in this context ritlecitinib tosylate exceeded the persistence criterion > 40 d for 
water (DT50 water 12 °C = 44 d, DT50 total system, 12°C = 91 d) in the Choptank water sediment 
system.  
Additionally, the applicant found a strong tendency of ritlecitinib to irreversibly bind to environmental 
reactants in the sediment (probably organic matter that contains sulfhydryl groups). As this 
irreversible binding sequesters ritlecitinib in the environment, its environmental persistency of 
ritlecitinib might get considerably prolonged. In terms of ecotoxicity, no adverse effects on activated 
sludge microorganisms were detected. While high concentrations of ritlecitinib were toxic to algae, led

to reproduction and growth impairments in daphnia, influenced post-hatch and overall survival as well 
as growth in fish, and influenced larval emergence of Chiromomus riparius, all calculated PEC/PNEC 
ratios were clearly below 1. Specifically, the PEC/PNEC ratio of the most sensitive endpoint in the most 
sensitive species (reproduction in daphnia) only amounted to 0.033. Therefore, no relevant 
ecotoxicological risks of ritlecitinib are expected in the environment.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics (PD) 
An extensive programme of primary in vitro pharmacology studies was conducted.   
IL-2 induced STAT5 phosphorylation and GM-CSF-induced STAT5 phosphorylation were not 
investigated in human PBMCs and rat, dog and human whole blood. Nevertheless, as expected of 
JAK3-dependent cytokines, the applicant provided adequate data on IL-2 inhibition by ritlecitinib in 
human whole blood. Based on comparable IC50 values for IL-15 and IL-21 between human, rat and dog 
(198, 137 and 170 nM for IL-15 and 362, 302 and 212 nM for IL-21, respectively), as well as for IL-2, 
IL-4, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21 in human whole blood (244, 340, 407, 266 and 355 nM, respectively), the 
applicant regarded the inhibition of IL-15 and IL-21 by ritlecitinib as surrogate for the comparison of 
IL-2 inhibition across species. Furthermore, ritlecitinib did not inhibit many other JAK3-independent 
cytokines and growth factors (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, IFNα, IFNγ, G-CSF and EPO), 
suggesting that inhibition of GM-CSF (JAK2-dependent) was not expected. Indeed, ritlecitinib did not 
affect GM-CSF in CD3+ cells in C3H/Hej mice. 
In order to demonstrate that exposures achieved after systemic administration of ritlecitinib selectively 
inhibited JAK3, but not other JAK kinases, the applicant provided projected IC50 values for JAK1, JAK2 
and TYK2 (17.4 µM, 42.6 µM and 99.9 µM, respectively), indicating more than 2 orders of magnitude 
weaker inhibitory potency than for JAK3 and, thus, having presumably no significant contribution to 
the pharmacological effect of ritlecitinib. Taking into account that lower average unbound 
concentrations (Cav values) are more predictive for in vivo effects than higher maximum concentrations 
(Cmax), as indicated by in vivo and ex vivo studies in rats (Telliez et al., 2016), the applicant claimed 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 55/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that exposures after systemic administration in AA mice were still below those required for inhibition of 
other JAK members.  
In study 011358, inhibition of human NK and CD8+ T cell activity by ritlecitinib was dependent on ITK. 
The applicant provided literature references to underline that TEC kinases, rather than JAK kinases, 
regulate CD8+ T cell and NK cell function. It was pointed out that the markers of CD8+ and NK cell 
activation, IFNɣ and CD107a-induced expression, depend on TEC kinases. Ritlecitinib inhibits ITK, TEC 
and TXK, which belong to the TEC kinases family and are all expressed on T lymphocytes, but ITK at a 
significantly higher level. To confirm these conclusions, the applicant demonstrated results from a 
published article (Xu H. et al., 2019) in which ritlecitinib potently inhibited CD107a and IFNγ 
expression in both CD8+ T cells and NK cells, while ITK-selective inhibitor showed a similar effect in 
CD8+, but lower in NK cells and JAK1/3-selective inhibitor did not react. Similar results were 
demonstrated by Sung L. (2021), who concluded that ITK-selective inhibitors reduced activity in CD8+ 
T cells but not in NK cells. These data suggest that ritlecitinib influences CD8+ T and NK cells activity 
by inhibiting not only ITK, but also other members of TEC kinases family. This information was 
adequately reflected in the section 5.1. of the SmPC (Mechanism of Action). 
Generally, in vivo PD studies should confirm the efficacy and mode of action of an active substance in 
the proposed clinical indication. Therefore, experiments performed by the applicant in animal models of 
diseases for different indications are considered as supportive only. Studies and assays submitted by 
the applicant are acknowledged and considered acceptable to the CHMP.  
The results of the studies reported in the research article of Dai et al., 2021, support the function of 
ritlecitinib being a potent JAK3 inhibitor and restoring hair growth by decreasing skin inflammation in 
an AA mouse model. Ritlecitinib was intravenously and topically administered to the AA mice. Upon 
CHMP’s request, the applicant justified that exposure data of ritlecitinib after oral administration (the 
proposed route of administration in human) in AA mice and data on symptoms, markers of 
neuroinflammation and molecular data upon ritlecitinib withdrawal were not available as the study in 
AA mice was performed solely with the intention to demonstrate that JAK3 inhibition would improve 
symptoms of AA. Regarding the missing data upon ritlecitinib withdrawal in AA mice, the applicant 
refers to results from the rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (study 
085612), where a neuroprotective effect could be demonstrated after oral administration of ritlecitinib. 
This result does not clarify possible effects following treatment cessation, especially when considering 
that EAE model and AA model are not interchangeable. To conclude, the lack of PK parameters in AA 
mice do not allow to confirm whether there are differences in exposures between healthy and AA mice, 
as different exposures were observed between healthy volunteers and AA patients in clinical studies as 
well. Consequently, possible inhibition of other JAK kinases in AA mice is not clearly excluded. 
However, from a clinical viewpoint, a proof of concept has been adequately addressed and therefore, 
this concern is not further pursued. 
In terms of the PD in vivo data, ritlecitinib showed to have immunosuppressive potential, reflected by 
improvements of disease parameters, in the adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model (study number 
090652), in the chemically induced inflammatory bowel disease mouse model (study number 181316) 
and the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (study number 085612). 
Intravenously administered ritlecitinib at 30mg/kg prevented the onset of AA by effectively reducing 
AA-associated skin inflammation (e.g. supported by data from immunofluorescence and flow 
cytrometric analysis) and avoiding hair loss in C3H/HeJ skin grafted mice. Additionally, i.v. treatment 
with ritlecitinib at 30mg/kg effectively reversed AA, again by reducing AA-associated skin 
inflammation, demonstrated by suppression of T cell proliferation and function. Interestingly, twice 
daily topical administration of ritlecitinib (2% w/w) showed to be highly effective in the reversal of AA 
in C3H/HeJ skin-grafted mice as well (Dai et al., 2021).

For the Lck kinase, known to play an important role in immunity, T cells and antigen receptor signal 
transduction, a mean % inhibition of control value of 34.6 was noticed in the screening assay for 
possible off-targets of ritlecitinib (study number 100009194). The applicant concluded that due to 
much higher ATP concentrations in cells, inhibition of Lck kinase would be expected to be even less, 
resulting in an IC50 of >10µM. Furthermore, in a follow-up study (study 151236) at 1µM ritlecitinib and 
low ATP concentrations, even lower inhibition of 22.3% was reached, confirming that off-target binding 
to Lck kinase is not expected at clinically relevant concentrations of ritlecitinib, with the projected IC50 
value of >10µM. 
Overall, the safety pharmacology programme submitted by the applicant is considered complete and 
adequate.  
Comparing both CV safety studies in dogs (study number 14GR078 and 14GR140), different effects on 
blood pressure, heart rate and QT-interval were noticed. While in the non-GLP compliant study SBP, 
DBP and MBP, as well as heart rate, decreased, leading to an increase in QT-interval, an increase in 
heart rates and a corresponding decrease in QT-interval was observed in the GLP-compliant study. No 
changes were observed in both studies for the corrected QT-Intervals (QTc). Unbound Cmax values of 
7084ng/ml of the 20mg/kg dose group in the non-GLP compliant study and 10483ng/ml of the 
45mg/kg dose group in the GLP-compliant study were determined, corresponding to ritlecitinib 
concentrations of 24,83µM and 36,74µM, respectively. Assuming an unbound Cmax of 1,1µM at steady-
state following a clinically intended dosing regimen of 50 mg QD ritlecitinib (study PMAR-1157), a 
broad safety margin of more than 22- and 33-fold the human exposure was calculated for the 20mg/kg 
and 45mg/kg dose groups in dogs. A NOEL of 15mg/kg was settled in the GLP-compliant dog study by 
the applicant, assuming a 13-fold unbound Cmax which can be expected at the clinical dose of 50mg. As 
the PK was not conducted at 15 mg/kg in the GLP-compliant CV safety study in dogs (study 14GR140); 
the safety margin at NOEL was calculated using the Day 1 mean unbound Cmax of 4185ng/ml from the 
GLP-compliant 8-week dog toxicity study (study 14GR135). However, the very small sample size of 4 
beagle dogs, actually 3 in the GLP-compliant study, since the data of one dog could not be evaluated, 
poses an issue with the informative value of the results. Although the results of these cardiovascular 
safety studies in beagle dogs can be regarded as supportive information only, possible CV effects are 
not expected with ritlecitinib due to selectivity towards JAK3. This is further discussed in the clinical 
safety section of this report. 
No PD drug interaction studies were performed by the applicant, which is accepted by the CHMP.   
Pharmacokinetics 
An extensive non-clinical programme to examine the pharmacokinetics in relevant non-clinical animal 
species and in humans, including investigations on ADME and the potential of ritlecitinib and its major 
plasma metabolite M2 to induce pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDI) was conducted. 
Extraction recoveries of ritlecitinib from Beagle dog plasma in the validation study 095221 ranged from 
69.1% to 74.9%; the recovery for the internal standard was 75.2%. In the validation reports for the 
LC-MS/MS detection methods of ritlecitinib in mouse, rat and rabbit plasma, extraction recoveries were 
within 20% of the targeted value (i.e. 100%). Consequently, the extraction recoveries in dog plasma 
appear to be worse than in the plasma of the other species. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant 
explained that despite the low extraction recoveries from dog plasma, the established LC-MS/MS 
method met all key validation acceptance criteria. This is acknowledged; however, it should be 
considered that the true ritlecitinib concentrations in dog plasma are likely higher than the ones 
reported by the LC-MS/MS method.

No repeated dose tissue distribution study was submitted by the applicant. According to the ICH S3B 
guideline, repeated dose tissue distribution studies may be required if certain circumstances are 
fulfilled, e.g. when single-dose tissue distribution studies suggest that the apparent half-life of the test 
compound (and/or metabolites) in organs or tissues significantly exceeds the apparent half-life of the 
elimination phase in plasma and if it is also more than twice the dosing interval in the toxicity studies. 
In the whole body autoradiography rat study 15647, considerably higher tissue elimination half-lifes 
were observed versus the half-life in plasma: tissue half-life of the radioactivity associated with 
ritlecitinib (i.e. originating either from ritlecitinib or from its metabolites) was only 55.1 hours in 
plasma, but much higher in many investigated organs such as, e.g. the eyes (439.1 hours), the 
adrenal gland (approximately 488 hours), the cardiac blood (396.7 hours), the spleen (478.1 hours), 
the pancreas (560.0 hours) and the lung (382.7 hours). Furthermore, these tissue elimination half-
lives clearly exceeded the daily dosing intervals in the submitted toxicity studies. Therefore, a repeated 
dose tissue distribution study would have been indicated. However, as a such study would presumably 
not add more relevant information regarding ritlecitinib’s potential to accumulate in tissues due to high 
tissue half-lives (probably due to off-target protein binding, as ritlecitinib contains an α,β-unsaturated 
carbonyl moiety designed to target a covalent interaction with the cysteine residue of the JAK3 enzyme 
to achieve high selectivity), no additional study was deemed necessary. 
Additionally, from the excretion kinetics of the administered radioactivity in healthy human volunteers 
(study 103503), it is apparent that no relevant excretion of the administered radioactivity occurred 
from 96 hours until the end of the experiment (240 hours). Furthermore, in the same study, large 
fractions of the administered radioactivity (35% in plasma and 49.8% in faeces) were non-extractable. 
These observations also suggest that a fraction of the administered ritlecitinib covalently binds to off-
target proteins throughout the body.  
Regarding the higher AUC0-t levels of ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites in whole blood than in plasma 
measured in the rat quantitative whole body autoradiography study 15647, it is presumed that blood 
cells act as a sink for ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites. While the Cmax levels between plasma and 
blood were approximately similar in the rat quantitative whole body autoradiography study 15647, the 
considerably increased AUC0-t demonstrates that elimination of ritlecitinib is slower in blood cells. It is 
conceivable that ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites are retained in blood cells by covalent protein 
binding within blood cells (as was, e.g. already identified in the in vitro human plasma protein binding 
study 103503 for human albumin). Haemoglobin contains cysteine residues (Viturri et al. 2013) which 
might be accessible for covalent reaction with ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites. This could explain the 
retention of ritlecitinib in red blood cells observed in the rat quantitative whole body autoradiography 
study 15647, and could also explain the rapid partitioning of ritlecitinib (but not of M2) into the cellular 
compartment of whole canine and human blood (study YDP/067/018). These findings are further 
discussed below, under toxicology sub-heading.  
Further, even in phosphate buffer alone, glutathione conjugation of ritlecitinib was observed, 
demonstrating that adduct formation is, to a certain extent, not dependent on enzymatic activation. 
This is another example of covalent reactivity of ritlecitinib towards thiol groups of cysteine residues in 
polypeptides (as in this case observed with glutathione), as was observed for human serum albumin 
and can also be hypothesised for haemoglobin (vide supra). Furthermore, this observation 
demonstrates that covalent reaction of ritlecitinib with thiol groups of cysteine residues in polypeptides 
does not need to be enzymatically triggered in order to occur, which explains the covalent reaction 
capacity of ritlecitinib with cysteine residues of off-target proteins observed throughout the submitted 
non-clinical studies. Additionally, the applicant reports that approximately up to 2% of 14C-labelled 
ritlecitinib added to human hepatocytes cultures in study 085839 was covalently bound to proteins in 
the cells demonstrating off-target covalent binding in hepatocytes. However, it should be noted that 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 58/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only a single dose was administered, thus this experiment cannot account for the potential 
accumulation of such protein adducts in hepatocytes at a chronic dosing regimen. 
Based on the quantitative whole body autoradiography rat study 15647 and the dog study 092809, it 
can be expected that the difference in BBB crossing of ritlecitinib and its metabolites between these 
two species is clearly higher than 2-fold. Based on this comparison, it is apparent that BBB crossing of 
ritlecitinib and/or its metabolites can vary between species.  
Regarding the inhibition of CYP450 isoforms by ritlecitinib (as observed in cultured human hepatocyte 
studies), the applicant agreed that the time-dependent inhibition by ritlecitinib of CYP3A (study 
121415) and CYP1A2 (study 123341) is likely mediated through irreversible binding to a cysteine 
within the reactive site of each of the enzymes. 
Similarly, the applicant agreed that the observed inhibitions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 by ritlecitinib in 
study 135124 could possibly be another example of off-target protein reactivity by ritlecitinib. The 
functional inhibitions of these enzymes are examples of irreversible reactions of ritlecitinib with off-
target proteins. 
Overall, an extensive study programme examined non-clinical ADME and PK drug interactions. Notably, 
throughout the submitted non-clinical PK and toxicology programme, binding of ritlecitinib to off-target 
proteins or polypeptides (presumably via covalent reaction with thiol groups of cysteine residues) was 
observed or is presumed. This was, apart from the pharmacological targets JAK3 and TEC kinases, 
observed or suspected for the following off-target polypeptides or proteins or in the following studies: 
human serum albumin (study 103503); glutathione (study 085839); CYP3A4 and potentially CYP1A2 
(studies XT135092, 022301, 121415 and 123341); UGT1A1 (study 135124); the proteins MAP2K7, 
DOCK10 and different PKC isoforms in dog brain homogenates (study 19GR193); haemoglobin 
(presumed based on the results in the quantitative whole body autoradiography rat study 15647); 
protein nucleophiles in general in cultured human hepatocytes (study 085839). Study 103503 
demonstrates that large fractions of the administered ritlecitinib (35% in plasma and 49.8% in faeces) 
are non-extractable (associated with the pellet) and therefore presumably related to irreversible 
protein binding. In the whole-body autoradiography rat study 15647, the exceedingly long tissue 
elimination half-lives could suggest sequestering of ritlecitinib by off-target proteins. Off-target protein 
binding at very high ritlecitinib exposures might have caused the aneugenicity of ritlecitinib in the in 
vitro studies WIL-655100 and 13GTX10 and the decreased fertility of rat spermatozoa in the rat 
fertility study 00655209. In the ERA, ritlecitinib irreversibly reacted with environmental reactants in 
sediments (presumably with thiol-containing organic matter).  
For CYP3A4 (and potentially CYP1A2) as well as UGT1A1 and some of the inhibitions in toxicity studies 
(e.g. aneugenicity and decreased fertility of rat spermatozoa), these interactions decreased the 
functional activity of the altered protein.  
The ritlecitinib concentration added to the human hepatocytes during the first phase of the experiment, 
and the subsequent CYP3A4-mediated turn-over kinetics of the isoform-specific test substrate 
(midazolam) in the second phase of the experiment, proved to be inversely proportional. This effect 
appears counterintuitive, as enzyme induction is supposed to translate into increased overall enzyme 
activity. However, it is presumed that the decreased enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 when pre-incubated 
with ritlecitinib is related to covalent interaction of ritlecitinib with the enzyme, which subsequently 
decreases its catalytic efficacy. As CYP3A4 possess accessible cysteine residues near their active site 
cavities, it is presumed that ritlecitinib can react with delicate cysteine residues in CYP3A4 and could 
thereby render it catalytically less active or even inactive. This notion could well explain the time-
dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5 by ritlecitinib, and ultimately constitutes another example of covalent 
reaction of ritlecitinib with off-target proteins.

In respect to the inhibition of UGT isoforms, the applicant found that UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 activity was 
inhibited by ritlecitinib with an IC50 value of 54 and 81 µM in human liver microsomes (in the absence 
of bovine serum albumin (BSA), in the presence of BSA IC50 values were higher). While these IC50 
values are not clinically relevant (as they clearly exceed expectable ritlecitinib exposures), these 
findings are interesting from a mechanistic perspective, as in study 135124, no glucuronide 
conjugation of ritlecitinib is expected. Therefore, inhibition of these enzymes was probably not caused 
by a substrate-mediated mechanism. As free thiol groups of cysteine residues within the intracisternal 
region of human UGT1A1 are important for its catalytic activity, it is well conceivable that, as already 
described for CYP450 isoforms (vide supra), ritlecitinib might have covalently reacted with cysteine 
residues of UGT isoforms and thereby decreased its catalytic efficacy to turn over the test substrates 
used in this study. Therefore, the observed inhibitions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 by ritlecitinib could be 
another example of off-target protein reactivity by ritlecitinib.  
In general, these findings demonstrate that reaction of ritlecitinib with off-target proteins is ubiquitous 
and common. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant adequately amended the section 5.2 of the SmPC to 
mention the potential of ritlecitinib to covalently react with off-target proteins. 
Toxicology 
As discussed above, the ritlecitinib-related erythrocyte effects observed in the rat repeated dose 
toxicity studies 14GR132, 20070067 and 8413430 could indicate that the accumulation of ritlecitinib 
(and potentially the reaction of ritlecitinib with haemoglobin) might lead to adverse erythrocytic 
effects. As especially eccentrocytes and pyknocytes are associated with increased cellular oxidative 
stress (Caldin et al. 2005; Berardi et al. 2017;), and as cysteine residues in haemoglobin act as 
important antioxidants (Viturri et al. 2013), covalent reaction of ritlecitinib with cysteine groups of 
haemoglobin may critically decrease the anti-oxidative capacity of erythrocytes. This could explain the 
observed erythrocytic cell abnormalities, the subsequent increased red cell distribution width, and 
ultimately the increased reticulocytes as a compensatory response. The applicant also communicated 
that the increased reticulocytes, mean corpuscular volume, RBC distribution width, hypochromatophilic 
RBC, and the presence of eccentrocytes and pyknocytes were consistent with oxidative damage to RBC 
and an appropriate erythroid regenerative response. The applicant thus hypothesised that the 
erythrocyte abnormalities in rats at very high ritlecitinib exposures were caused by metabolite trapping 
of ritlecitinib via glutathione conjugation in erythrocytes with subsequent decreases of the cellular anti-
oxidative capacity. However, such metabolites are usually excreted by ATP-dependent efflux 
transporters. Therefore, it is considered more plausible that in erythrocytes ritlecitinib reacts with 
haemoglobin at high exposures. However, no signs of anaemia were observed in clinical studies, 
suggesting that the erythrocytic rat findings at high ritlecitinib exposures have no clinical relevance for 
patients. 
Regarding the observed proteinuria in the rat repeated dose toxicity studies 14GR132, 20070067 and 
8413430, the applicant considered this finding as not adverse because the incidence and degree of 
proteinuria decreased during the experiment; and there were no corresponding adverse clinical 
pathology changes, clinical signs, or microscopic findings indicative of renal injury. Furthermore, upon 
CHMP’s request, the applicant concluded that the observed cases of proteinuria cannot be translated to 
sub-microscopic minimal change glomerulopathy. As no clinical correlates were found, the observed 
test-article-related proteinuria and increased urine volumes in the rat studies 14GR132, 20070067 and 
8413430 are considered to have no clinical relevance for patients.  
Regarding the hyaline droplets (containing lipofuscin and alpha2μ-globulin) identified in the kidneys of 
ritlecitinib-treated rats in the repeated dose toxicity studies 14GR132, 20070067, 8413430 and 
8384525, the applicant discussed that a relation between these renal droplets to off-target protein 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

reaction of ritlecitinib is unlikely, as such accumulations were, e.g. not observed in post-mitotic cells 
(e.g. neurons, cardiomyocytes) in rats. Notably, no similar findings were observed in mice and dogs at 
high ritlecitinib dosing regimens. Furthermore, the applicant also explained upon CHMP’s request that 
the identified renal alpha2μ-globulin droplets are a (male) rat-specific finding in studies in which high 
amounts of xenobiotics are administered. Considering these aspects, the formation of these renal 
droplets in rats are considered of low clinical relevance for patients.  
Regarding the test-article-related opportunistic skin infections observed in the dog repeated dose 
toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163 as a complication of over-immunosuppression, a concern was 
originally raised on the long recovery duration from this condition after ritlecitinib dosing cessation. 
The applicant responded that the significant over-immunosuppression observed at high ritlecitinib 
dosing of dogs was similarly observed in dog studies conducted for the development of other JAK 
inhibitors (JAKis). Therefore, this finding can be considered an expected effect of exaggerated 
pharmacology at high exposures of JAKis in dogs. As over-immunosuppression is an established clinical 
risk factor of JAKis, this concern was therefore not further pursued from a non-clinical viewpoint. See 
clinical safety section.  
According to the applicant, the observed opportunistic skin infections were triggered by Demodex 
mites and/or papilloma viruses in affected dogs. Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence of Demodex 
being the core reason for the observed skin findings in dogs. In the first 9-month dog study, deep skin 
scraping was performed but no ectoparasites were found in the skin of the affected dogs. In the 
confirmatory study, no Demodex diagnostics were performed. The applicant was asked to present a 
reason for not performing deep skin scraping for Demodex in the confirmatory dog 9-month study. The 
applicant persisted in explaining the skin findings as a clinical onset of demodicosis while using some 
arguments as why the parasite was not actually found. The applicant’s arguments were however, 
found inadequate. Nevertheless, given that the clinical skin findings are manageable, this issue was 
not further pursued from a non-clinical viewpoint. See clinical safety section for further discussion on 
infections.   
Regarding the identified neurotoxicity of ritlecitinib in the Beagle dog studies 20070068 and 20099163, 
the molecular pathogenesis of this finding is still not understood. Microscopically, the axonal 
dystrophies were identified as spheroids, which are “bubble-like biological features that form on most 
degenerating axons” (Yong et al. 2021). Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant clarified that no signs of 
neurodegeneration were observed. Importantly, no alterations of synapses and myelination were 
observed apart from the axonal dystrophies. 
It is conceivable that ritlecitinib led to axonal dystrophy generation in dog toxicity studies by three 
distinct mechanisms (either separately or by combinations of them): a.) by functional impairment of 
delicate neuronal proteins after covalent reaction with ritlecitinib; b.) by covalently reacting with 
delicate axonal proteins which could lead to aggregation of protein-ritlecitinib adducts and subsequent 
proteinopathy; or c.) by covalently reacting to free thiol groups of cysteine residues in the CNS or PNS 
and therefore depleting anti-oxidative capacity, which ultimately increases oxidative tissue damage. 
The applicant however considers that the reaction of ritlecitinib with an off-target protein in the dog 
brain caused the formation of the observed axonal dystrophies. 
Furthermore, regarding the TEM investigations in study 20070068, a similar electron-dense 
appearance as found in the brain specimens of dogs affected by axonal dystrophies has been described 
for amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (El Haji et al. 2019). However, upon CHMP’s request, the 
applicant rejected that the identified electron-dense structures in dog brains affected by axonal 
dystrophies had a similar morphology than the one encountered in neurodegenerative diseases.  
Of note, the applicant considers the axonal dystrophies in the cerebellar vermis of the 10 mg/kg/day 
groups in study 20099163 not adverse. However, considering that none of the control animals had 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

axonal dystrophies in this area of the cerebellum and considering the apparent neurotoxicity of 
ritlecitinib that also leads to functional neurological impairments (i.e. hearing loss), this interpretation 
is not supported by the CHMP. 
Importantly, axonal dystrophy incidences in the dog study 20099163 showed similar magnitudes when 
ritlecitinib was administered at 20 mg/kg/day q.d. and 10 mg/kg/day b.i.d. As the b.i.d. doses were 
administered approximately 6 hours apart, the two doses per day in the 10 mg/kg/day b.i.d. can be 
considered as two independent administrations considering the short plasma T1/2 of ritlecitinib in Beagle 
dogs (1.1 hours, study 132012). Therefore, the similar incidence of axonal dystrophies in the 20 
mg/kg/day q.d. and 10 mg/kg/day b.i.d. groups suggests that the administered cumulative total dose 
determined the observed formation of axonal dystrophies in the dog study 20099163. On a cellular 
level, this finding appears plausible, as the CNS/PNS parenchyma is in a post-mitotic state, allowing 
cumulative ritlecitinib-mediated lesions. However, this notion could be worrisome, as after prolonged 
administration, patients could reach cumulative doses that had led to axonal dystrophies in the pivotal 
dog toxicity studies. The applicant responded to this concern that normal protein turnover (neuronal 
protein T1/2 of approximately 5.4 days) would limit the amount of off-target binding of ritlecitinib in 
dogs to within 4-5 half-lives (approximately 20-25 days) and prevent indefinite accumulation with 
time. However, following this hypothesis, one would expect axonal dystrophies in the 8-weeks dog 
study 14GR153. As no axonal dystrophies were observed in this study, the applicant’s hypothesis is not 
fully supported. It is not apparent why the formation of axonal dystrophies would take months while 
this equilibrium is attained much sooner. Therefore, a risk of accumulation of ritlecitinib protein 
adducts in the nervous system of patients can ultimately not fully be rejected in the absence of long-
term safety data. This is further discussed in the clinical safety section. 
Furthermore, the applicant was not able to calculate the cumulative ritlecitinib amounts that had 
partitioned to the dog CNS/PNS and caused axonal dystrophies in the pivotal dog toxicity studies 
20070068 and 20099163 (for all dose groups), and to estimate after what time of chronic ritlecitinib 
administration patients would obtain similar cumulative brain exposures.   
Overall, the observed neurotoxicity in dogs was unambiguously caused by ritlecitinib, as axonal 
dystrophies a.) were observed at high incidences in test-article groups (frequently in 100% of the 
animals), b.) proved to be perfectly reproducible in the dog studies 20070068 and 20099163, c.) 
generally increased in severity and incidence in a dose-dependent manner, and d.) were correlated 
with functional impairments (hearing loss). In addition, the occurrence of axonal dystrophies depended 
on cumulative rather than threshold exposures.  
Furthermore, ritlecitinib strongly tends to covalently react with off-target proteins throughout the body 
(including proteins expressed in the nervous system that are connected with neurological diseases 
such as MAP2K and PKCs), often leading to functional impairment. It is therefore assumed that the 
axonal dystrophies in dogs are a result of covalent reactions of ritlecitinib with proteins in the nervous 
system, which could lead to impaired function of delicate neuronal proteins and/or accumulation of 
neurotoxic protein-ritlecitinib adducts. Since ritlecitinib demonstrated a high potential to accumulate in 
tissues and penetrate the BBB, and that ritlecitinib-mediated lesions might accumulate in the post-
mitotic nervous system parenchyma, an adverse neurotoxic outcome pathway cannot be fully rejected 
at the molecular level.   
Notably, these findings largely reversed during 6 months of ritlecitinib-free recovery in dogs. The 
applicant thus concluded that the reversal of the axonal dystrophies in dog upon dosing cessation 
might likely be related to intracellular protein turn-over and subsequent clearance of ritlecitinib adducts 
with off-target proteins. Assuming that the same mechanism would also apply to patients, this could 
be an important de-risking factor.

Nonetheless, based on the data available thus far, a potential risk for patients receiving a chronic 
ritlecitinib treatment cannot be fully excluded. This is supported by a.) the unambiguity of this signal in 
chronic dog toxicity studies, b.) the lack of understanding of its pathogenesis, c.) the reactivity of 
ritlecitinib to covalently and irreversibly react with off-target proteins (including the nervous system), 
d.) the suspected accumulative aetiology of the axonal dystrophies as suggested in study 20099163, 
and e.) the fact that no such effects were found in non-clinical studies of similar covalent inhibitor 
products. Therefore, upon CHMP’s request, a warning was added in section 4.4 of the SmPC, and a 
summary of the axonal dystrophy findings in dogs was included in the section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, given the limited availability of long-term clinical safety data, this safety concern will be 
followed-up post-approval (see clinical safety and RMP sections below). 
Taking into consideration the abundantly established binding of ritlecitinib to off-target proteins, 
hypersensitivity reactions towards ritlecitinib and autoimmunity would be, in theory, a realistic side 
effect of ritlecitinib administration; although, such reactions might not be observed during chronic 
ritlecitinib treatment due to its pharmacologic immunosuppression. However, upon CHMP’s request, 
the applicant considers the potential of ritlecitinib to induce autoimmunity as small. This is agreed.  
Chronic administration of ritlecitinib in the long-term rat study 8384525 led to statistically significant 
increased incidences of mostly benign neoplasms of the thymus and the thyroid gland. However, 
increased incidences of malignant thymomas were also observed in test-article group animals. As these 
incidences were considerably higher than the incidences of malignant thymomas in control rats of the 
same strain (CRO historical database; Moore et al. 2019; Taylor and Mowat 2020), and as the 
occurrences of these malignant thymomas followed a dose-response, these malignant neoplasms are 
possibly test-article related. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant added in section 5.3 of the SmPC that 
an increased incidence of malignant thymomas after ritlecitinib administration to female rats in study 
8384525 could not be excluded.  
The submitted toxicology studies demonstrated that ritlecitinib affects the fertility of male rats at high 
exposures. Regarding the decreased male fertility in the FEED study 00655209, the applicant 
considered that ritlecitinib did not affect spermatogenesis. Therefore, the applicant hypothesised that 
ritlecitinib impacted sperm function and capacity to fertilise the egg (through effects on sperm 
capacitation or acrosome reaction). Specifically, the applicant communicated that JAK/STAT family 
members are present in sperm and potentially also active in signalling in sperm capacitation and/or the 
acrosome reaction. Inhibition by ritlecitinib could therefore inhibit these functions. However, the 
applicant also noted that numerous other proteins, including kinases, are important in capacitation and 
acrosome reaction processes, all of which might be susceptible to inhibition by ritlecitinib at high 
exposures. Both hypotheses are supported by the CHMP. Importantly, the applicant concluded that the 
effect of very high ritlecitinib exposures on sperm functionality in rats did not progress with the 
duration of dosing and that the adverse effect of high ritlecitinib exposures on sperm functionality is 
expected to be transient and reversible after dosing cessation. Finally, as these effects were only 
observed at considerably supra-therapeutic exposures, a clinical impact is considered to be of little 
likelihood. This is supported by the CHMP.  
Regarding the submitted embryo-foetal development studies, no contra-indication for pregnancy was 
initially issued in the SmPC in section 4.3. Nevertheless, in view of the available non-clinical data and 
in line with other products in the same class, the applicant agreed to add a pregnancy (and breast-
feeding) contra-indication in the SmPC, upon CHMP’s request. In addition, the applicant also provided 
a recommendation for a sufficiently long ritlecitinib-free period prior to pregnancy initiation. 
Specifically, the applicant proposed that women of childbearing potential be advised to use effective 
means of contraception during treatment up to at least 1 month following the final dose of ritlecitinib. 
This is agreed. This recommendation was adequately included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. Also see 
discussion on clinical safety.

Regarding the click chemistry-based chemoproteomic study 19GR193, ritlecitinib-binding to Protein 
Kinase C (PKC) isoform was detected in areas of the dog brain that were affected by ritlecitinib-
mediated axonal dystrophies in the dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163. This is interesting, 
as PKC signalling alterations are involved in neurodegenerative disease e.g., PKC activation exhibits a 
beneficial effect on amyloid pathology at several levels and is therefore an important signalling 
pathway in the pathogenesis complex of Alzheimer disease (Talman et al. 2016). Consequently, 
alterations of PKC isoforms by covalent ritlecitinib-binding might lead to neurodegenerative changes 
similar as occur in Alzheimer. Additionally, alteration of PKC isoforms is known to lead to the 
neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 14, which can also lead to neuronal hearing 
impairment (Shirajuji et al. 2019). The neurological hearing losses observed in the dog repeated dose 
toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163 could subsequently be related to ritlecitinib-mediated PKC 
signalling alterations. Finally, reactions of PKC isoforms by substances that react with cysteine residues 
in its structure are well described in the literature (e.g. Ward et al. 1995), rendering a cysteine-
mediated reaction of ritlecitinib with PKC isoforms conceivable. Of note, in the kinase selectivity panel 
assay in study 151236, inactivation of PKC isoforms by ritlecitinib proved little efficient (maximally 
approximately 13% inhibition at 1 µM concentrations). However, as the applicant estimates that the 
unbound liver inlet ritlecitinib concentration at the proposed clinical dosing regimen is 8 μM, also in the 
brain, ritlecitinib levels might be attained that lead to a relevant extent of PKC inhibition. Additionally, 
it is also conceivable that a reaction with ritlecitinib with PKC isoforms in the brain could lead to an 
increased proteolytic degradation of PKC-ritlecitinib adducts, rendering an overall decreased PKC 
activity in the brain. The alteration of PKC signalling by ritlecitinib might explain the neurological 
alterations observed in the dog repeated dose toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163. However, the 
applicant responded that the binding of PKC isoforms by ritlecitinib is not aetiologically or biologically 
relevant to the ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophy formation in dogs. According to the applicant, 
ritlecitinib has a relatively low binding affinity to PKC compared to other potential off-targets and 
showed minimal inhibition in the Invitrogen kinase selectivity panel. Specifically, the applicant 
concluded that the binding of ritlecitinib to PKC can be predicted to be even lower than MAP2K7. The 
applicant also concluded that there is no in vitro or in vivo evidence suggesting that there is an 
alteration in PKC signalling by ritlecitinib or that it could contribute to axonal dystrophies. These 
aspects are acknowledged by the CHMP; a risk to patients is therefore considered low.  
As demonstrated by a mechanistic toxicity study (study number 19GR193) of ritlecitinib, DOCK10 and 
MAP2K7 were identified as potential off-target binding proteins in the dog central nervous system. 
Regarding the binding of ritlecitinib to MAP2K7 as identified in study 19GR372, the applicant was 
expected to discuss the pathological and especially neurological relevance of this finding for patients, 
considering that dysfunction of MAP2K7 signalling is suspected to be correlated with the aetiology of 
neurological diseases such as schizophrenia (Winchester et al.). The applicant responded that the off-
target binding of ritlecitinib with MAP2K7 does not lead to axonal dystrophies in dogs, and that this off-
target reaction at clinically relevant exposures is not considered to impose a safety relevance for the 
clinical use of ritlecitinib. The latter was based on a provided literature review and a summary of the 
relevant non-clinical data. Specifically, the applicant concluded that the off-target MAP2K7 binding 
noted after incubation with very high concentrations of ritlecitinib in brain homogenates obtained from 
normal dogs is not considered of neuropathological relevance to patients at clinically relevant doses of 
ritlecitinib. Importantly, the applicant also communicated that there were no reported events or 
evidence of schizophrenia or potential associated symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, or 
disorganised thinking associated with ritlecitinib treatment in clinical studies. Considering these 
aspects, the relevance of MAP2K7 inhibition by ritlecitinib is considered to be low for patients. 
According to findings from an article (Ruiz-Lafuente N. et al., 2019), DOCK10-knockout mice showed 
slower coat loss due to reduced senescence gene set expression. There is no evidence of DOCK10

involvement in the pathophysiology of autoimmune AA since known genes linked to DOCK10 are 
associated with morphogenesis and differentiation (HOXA5), epidermal growth factor (EGF) signalling 
and chromatin condensation. Furthermore, the only immune cells shown to be reduced in DOCK10-
knockout (KO) mice were Splenic B cells, considered as irrelevant in AA (Ruiz-Lafuente N. et al., 
2019). In addition, DOCK10 was identified as a potential off-target binding protein only in the CNS of 
dogs; however, ritlecitinib potency against DOCK10 was not investigated due to the lack of a cysteine 
at the same position as JAK3, indicating low probability of covalent binding. Therefore, to the existing 
knowledge, DOCK10 is probably not included in the pathogenesis of AA, and the ability of ritlecitinib to 
inhibit DOCK10 remains questionable, especially in mice and humans.  
Ritlecitinib’s covalent nature of binding to JAK3 was demonstrated by adequate mass spectrometry and 
x-ray crystallography data. 
The ICH M7(R1) specifies that bacterial mutagenicity assays are expected to be performed in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations and that lack of full GLP compliance does 
not necessarily mean that the data cannot be used to support clinical trials and marketing 
authorisations. As the submitted exploratory Ames tests were nonetheless in line with appropriate 
guidance (e.g. highest tested concentrations 5 mg/plate, cytotoxicity and solubility assessments, 5 
relevant strains, adequate positive controls etc.), the non-GLP assays submitted in the dossier are 
considered sufficient for mutagenicity evaluation of (potential) impurities.  
Ritlecitinib was not mutagenic in the bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames assay). Ritlecitinib was not 
aneugenic or clastogenic at exposures equal to 130 times the MRHD on an unbound AUC basis based 
on the results of the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. 
In addition, 5 non-GLP compliant mechanistic studies on the axonal dystrophy findings in the Beagle 
dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163 were submitted.  
Specifically, the goal of study 17GR131 was to examine the plasma and brain tissue concentrations of 
ritlecitinib (superior olivary nucleus, cochlear nucleus and hippocampus) after oral gavage 
administration to female Beagle dogs (n=4 per group) at 0 and 40 mg/kg/day when administered for 3 
consecutive days. Then, the objective of study 19GR193 was to examine potential off-target proteins in 
the dog CNS that might be causally related to the observed axonal dystrophies identified in the 9-
month repeated dose toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163. Specifically, a click chemistry-based 
chemoproteomic method was used to examine potential off-target proteins in Beagle dog (18-21 
months old) brain tissue homogenates (hippocampus (n=5) and rostral cerebellar vermis (n=3)). 
Interestingly, the superior olivary nucleus was not investigated, even though this brain area in the 
pons was especially affected by ritlecitinib-mediated axonal dystrophies in the dog studies 20070068 
and 20099163. As the axonal dystrophies in this brain area of the dog also led to functional 
impairments (up to severe neuronal hearing loss), sparing this brain area in the investigations of Study 
19GR193 is unfortunate. While it is appreciated that the applicant examined potential off-target 
proteins for ritlecitinib in the dog brain in this study, all affected brain areas by ritlecitinib-mediated 
axonal dystrophies (especially the superior olivary nucleus) would have been needed to be analysed in 
such studies. Finally, albeit such studies might give some mechanistic understanding of the pathology 
underlying the observed ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophies in dogs, their translatability to humans 
remains elusive, especially as the possibility of human-specific neurologic off-targets of ritlecitinib 
cannot be addressed by studies using dog brain homogenates. 
However, regarding the observed ritlecitinib-mediated axonal dystrophies in the dog repeated dose 
toxicity studies 20070068 and 20099163, study 21GR164 did not seem relevant in elucidating the 
pathogenesis of the observed axonal dystrophies. This stems from the methodological weaknesses of 
this study (expression was only studied on the mRNA level), and from the fact that DOCK10 is not 
known to be a target liable for eliciting neurodegenerative diseases. Quite on the contrary, recent 
Assessment report

investigations suggest that knock-out of this protein in mice actually might have beneficial effects in 
neuroinflammatory disorders and is therefore even proposed to be used in the treatment of multiple 
sclerosis (Namekata et al. 2020). However, no concerns were identified in this study.  
Environmental Risk Assessment 
The CHMP originally raised some concerns on the irreversible binding of ritlecitinib to environmental 
reactants. Specifically, in the 100 days water-sediment degradation study (study 260E-339), the 
fraction of non-extractable, irreversibly bound radioactivity (that had originally been added as labelled 
ritlecitinib) in the Brandywine Creek and Choptank River sediments at test termination were 74.9% 
and 39.2%, respectively. Similarly, in the 28-day surface-water and suspended sediment 
biodegradation study (study 260E-340) of ritlecitinib in Brandywine Creek surface water and in 
sediment amended surface water (containing approximately 1002 mg/L total suspended sediment), the 
main pathway for the disappearance of parent from both test systems was also transformation into 
non-extractable residues. This affected 40.8 to 49.1% of the added ritlecitinib. Note that the kinetics of 
this irreversible binding to sediment were fast: in study 260E-340, a quarter to two fifth of the 
irreversibly bound ritlecitinib-associated radioactivity pool was already bound to the sediment 1 minute 
after addition to the batch experiment. As widespread covalent reactivity of ritlecitinib with off-target 
proteins was observed throughout the submitted non-clinical dossier, it appears plausible that also in 
sediments and surface water, ritlecitinib covalently binds to organic structures (that presumably 
contain sulfhydryl moieties). This suggests that the covalent binding of ritlecitinib to organic matter is 
an ubiquitous chemical reaction not limited to humans and animals. The binding of ritlecitinib to 
environmental reactants could therefore considerably increase the persistence of ritlecitinib in the 
environment. However, as ritlecitinib proved to possess a very low ecotoxic potential at the 
environmentally expected concentrations, this potential for increased persistency presumably bears no 
or only little ecotoxicologic relevance. 
Overall, ritlecitinib is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, ritlecitinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the applicant provided a comprehensive evaluation of pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic 
and toxicologic properties of ritlecitinib. Studies in animal have shown neurologic and reproductive 
toxicities. The impact on neurotoxicity is further discussed in the clinical safety section. Ritlecitinib is 
contraindicated in pregnancy and breast-feeding. Women of childbearing potential have to use 
effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month following the final dose of ritlecitinib. Overall, 
ritlecitinib is considered approvable from a non-clinical point. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
21 pivotal studies in healthy subjects were submitted to support the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
ritlecitinib. In addition, PK data were included in population PK analyses. 
Ritlecitinib is formulated as a single enantiomer. Ritlecitinib has a high solubility in aqueous solutions. 
The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily. Considering this dose, ritlecitinib tosylate is a high 
solubility drug, in accordance with the ICH M09 Biowaiver guideline. The estimated absorption of 
ritlecitinib tosylate is less than 85%. The absolute bioavailability is 64% and the absorbed fraction of 
the dose was estimated to be 89% in the labelled ADME study. However, as for the latter no complete 
mass balance could be obtained, which may imply uncertainties in the absorbed fraction; by taking a 
conservative approach, ritlecitinib tosylate should be considered a BCS Class III drug, according to the 
Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). 
Analytical methods 
For the analysis of ritlecitinib in plasma and urine, validated LC-MS/MS methods were applied, showing 
acceptable accuracy and precision. Validation/analysis in plasma were carried out at 2 analytical sites. 
Cross-validation was carried out between both plasma analytical methods, using spiked QC samples 
and 40 incurred study samples from study B7981054. QC accuracy showed a negative bias at Labcorp 
Shanghai compared to York Bioanalytical Services, ranging from -9.7 to -20.1%. Further, for the 
incurred sample analysis a trend to a negative bias was observed at Labcorp Shanghai, although 
analysis showed that 92.5% was within the acceptable 20% difference between the 2 labs and passing 
the acceptance criteria. According to EMA guideline on bioanalytical method validation, for QC samples, 
inter-laboratory differences for mean accuracy should be within ±15%. The applicant was asked to 
justify that the negative bias of the method, and especially the large negative bias observed for QCDIL 
would not significantly affect PK results from corresponding clinical studies or results from the 
population PK analysis. New QCs were prepared and analysed, and the results showed that the 
difference between the 2 labs was well within the criteria. The applicant attributed the difference 
between the first and second analyses to variability in preparation. The results of the second analysis 
align with those obtained for incurred sample reanalysis at both labs. Therefore, this issue is 
considered resolved. 
Validated LC-MS/MS methods with acceptable accuracy and precision were applied for the analysis of 
the co-administered drugs midazolam in plasma, efavirenz in plasma, levonorgestrel and ethinyl 
estradiol in plasma, rosuvastatin in plasma, sumatriptan in plasma, tolbutamide and 4-
hydroxytolbutamide in plasma, caffeine in plasma and for the biomarker N1-methylnicotinamide in 
plasma and urine. 
Accuracy and precision during study sample analysis were within normal criteria. ISR data showed 
good reproducibility. Furthermore, study samples were analysed within the established stability 
periods. 
PopPK analyses 
PopPK analysis has been conducted iteratively as ritlecitinib concentration information became 
available from completed studies. 
PopPK model PMAR-EQDDB798h-Proof of Concept-1091 encompasses all studies included in the 
previously developed models PMAR-EQDD-B798d-Other-1023 and PMAR-EQDD-B798d-PrePoC-859;

therefore, the results supersede those of the previous iterations. The final model described in PMAR-
EQDD-B798d-DP4-1157 was developed using PMAREQDD-B798h-Proof of Concept-1091. 
Model PMAR-EQDDB798h-Proof of Concept-1091 was a popPK model of ritlecitinib in healthy volunteers 
and patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, moderate-to-severe AA, moderate-to-
severe ulcerative colitis, or active non-segmental vitiligo. The PK of ritlecitinib could be adequately 
described by a 2-compartment model with first-order oral absorption with a direct-response non-
stationary clearance and bioavailability driven by peripheral concentrations in the analysis population 
of healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, moderate-to-severe RA, AA, vitiligo, 
and moderate-to-severe UC patients. Goodness-of-fit plots of the model and the pcVPC demonstrated 
that the model adequately described the time course of ritlecitinib plasma concentrations and its 
associated variability after oral dosing. 
A final model PMAR-EQDD-B798d-DP4-1157 was developed, including healthy volunteers, subjects 
with severe renal impairment, and patients with AA. The final model was a 2-compartment model with 
first-order absorption with inter-individual variance on apparent clearance and apparent central volume 
of distribution, a proportional random unexplained variability model, and non-stationary clearance and 
bioavailability directly driven by peripheral concentrations. Goodness-of-fit plots of the model and the 
pcVPC demonstrated that the model adequately described the time course of ritlecitinib plasma 
concentrations and its associated variability after oral dosing. 
The final model addresses ritlecitinib non-linear PK by introducing a non-stationary effect of ritlecitinib 
concentrations from the peripheral compartment on both CL/F and F. Different structural models were 
tested in the development, and the model with peripheral concentration dependent CL and F provided 
the best fit. Goodness-of-fit plots of the model and the pcVPC demonstrated that this model 
adequately described the time course of ritlecitinib plasma concentrations and its associated variability 
after oral dosing.  
Absorption 
After oral dosing, maximal plasma concentrations were reached at about 1 h after administration. 
The absolute bioavailability of ritlecitinib is about 64%. Based on oral and intravenous administration 
of the labelled active substance, the relative urinary recovery (oral/intravenous) of the labelled 
compounds was about 89%, indicating a high fraction absorbed (fa). 
Ritlecitinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Dose normalised Cmax was independent of dose within the 
range of 5 to 800 mg, and considering the relatively high bioavailability, the impact of intestinal P-gp 
or BCRP efflux on the PK is considered limited by the applicant. Additionally, inhibition of P-gp and 
BCRP due to drug interactions is unlikely to impact the absorption of ritlecitinib significantly. 
After a single dose, ritlecitinib AUCinf increased more than dose-proportional over the 20 – 800 mg 
dose range, however, dose-proportional increases were observed up to 200 mg. Cmax increased dose 
proportional after a single dose. After q.d. dosing, popPK analysis showed dose-proportional increases 
in AUCtau and Cmax from 30 mg to 200 mg compared to 50 mg q.d. at steady-state as median 
geometric mean ratios were within 0.8 to 1.25.  
After q.d. oral dosing, a steady state was achieved after about 4 days, and the accumulation ratio was 
about 1.45 (popPK estimation). Considering the elimination half-life of about 2 h, the unexpected 
accumulation indicates non-stationary PK characteristics, where ritlecitinib CL changes following 
multiple doses resulting in a lower CL than after single doses. The mechanism contributing to this 
change in CL after multiple dosing is not clear. 
The inter-subject variability observed after 50 mg q.d. administration in AA patients showed an inter-
subject variability of about 47 and 44% for AUCtau and Cmax, respectively. The intra-subject variability 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 68/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or within-subject standard deviations estimated in study B7981022 were 12 % and 24 % for AUCinf and 
Cmax, respectively. The intrasubject variability or within-subject standard deviations estimated in study 
B7981029 were 11.9 % and 25.2 % for AUCinf and Cmax, respectively. Pooled across treatments, intra-
subject variability was estimated using ANOVA. The final popPK estimated intra-subject variability in 
Cl/F was about 18%, indicating that ritlecitinib is not subject to high intra-subject variability. 
Both non-compartmental and population PK analyses show higher exposures in AA patients than 
healthy subjects. The underlying cause is unknown, but it is hypothesised that inflammatory condition 
in AA patients leads to reduced ritlecitinib clearance. At the recommended 50 mg QD dose, the non-
compartmental analysis (NCA) showed a 2.6-fold higher exposure in AA patients, while popPK analyses 
showed a 1.5-fold higher exposure. Upon CHMP’ request, the applicant clarified the discrepancy 
between NCA and Pop PK results due to the limited sample sizes, uncontrolled demographic factors 
across different treatment groups, and different sampling schemes in healthy participant studies 
compared to AA patient studies. In addition, a difference in body weight may have additionally 
contributed. The disease state (alopecia areata, alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis) had no 
significant impact on ritlecitinib clearance. 
Population PK estimates indicate for the recommended dosing scheme of 50 mg q.d. the following 
exposure data in AA patients (geometric mean (%CV): AUCtau 1249 (73) and Cmax 370 (39). 
In clinical studies, a loading dose of 200 mg was also used, i.e. a loading dose of 200 mg q.d. for 4 
weeks followed by 50 mg q.d.. The longitudinal concentration-response analysis of the SALT score (see 
section Pharmacodynamics) demonstrated that although the corresponding loading dose regimen 
achieves SALT ≤10 response faster (about 3 weeks faster for 200/50 vs 50 mg dose), by week 48 
there was no significant additional benefit of the loading dose regimen. Therefore, no loading dose is 
recommended. Furthermore, the longitudinal concentration-response analysis also demonstrated that 
the doses of 50 mg and 30 mg are in the ascending linear part of the dose-response curve, with the 
concentrations associated with 50 mg approximating the EC50. Hence, 50 mg is predicted to provide 
more benefit over the 30 mg dose in terms of efficacy response (see further sections 
Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy). 
Based on a log-normal distribution and observed variability in PK and taking into account analysis on 
exposure-response relationships of ritlecitinib for safety endpoints and exposure-response relationship 
of ritlecitinib for efficacy, mean exposure differences because of intrinsic or extrinsic factors, which fall 
within the range of 0.5- to 2-fold of the mean for the reference group, are considered not clinically 
relevant. However, the longitudinal concentration-response analysis indicated that a 30 mg q.d. dose 
would provide less efficacy. The suggested acceptable 0.5-fold difference in exposure, which would 
translate in a 25 mg q.d. dose, will thus also provide less efficacy. Therefore the 0.5-fold cut-off being 
not clinically relevant was further justified, i.e. both the 30 mg and 50 mg doses have been shown to 
be efficacious; however, the 50 mg group had a higher efficacy (proportion of participants who 
achieved severity of alopecia tool [SALT]≤10) compared to 30 mg. A subject receiving a 50 mg dose 
and ending at the lower 0.5-fold exposure due to variability (and covariates) would fall in the higher 
exposure and still efficacious range of a 30 mg dose. 
In clinical studies, the main formulation used was a 50 mg tablet. Intake of the 50 mg tablet after a 
high fat, high caloric meal decreased Cmax by about 39%, while AUC was unaffected. Intake of a 100 
mg capsule after a high-fat high caloric meal decreased Cmax by about 32%, while AUC increased by 
11% (not statistically significant). The 100 mg capsule formulation is dose-proportional (same blend) 
to the proposed 50 mg capsule formulation. Therefore, the results can be extrapolated to the 
commercial 50 mg capsule, as the criteria for a biowaiver for additional strengths have been fulfilled 
(see Bioequivalence/bioavailability). 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

Ritlecitinib was administered as tablets in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 efficacy and safety study and long-
term safety study without regard to the timing of meals. The lower Cmax is considered not clinically 
relevant. The SmPC recommends the capsule intake once daily with or without food, which is agreed 
upon. 
Bioavailability/bioequivalence 
In the development, the pivotal formulation was a 50 mg immediate-release tablet. In addition, 10 mg 
tablets were used in some studies. However, due to cold chain storage requirements, the ritlecitinib 
immediate-release tablets were unsuitable for commercial development. Therefore, the applicant 
developed a 50 mg capsule as the commercial formulation. 
Bioequivalence between a 100 mg capsule formulation and the 50 mg tablet under fasting conditions 
could be shown. The 100 mg capsule is dose-proportional (same blend) to the proposed 50 mg 
commercial formulation. Applying a biowaiver for additional strengths, using paddle apparatus at 50 
rpm, 500 ml media pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8, comparable dissolution could not be shown, as the 100 mg 
capsule showed a slower dissolution, according to the applicant, attributed to a slower disruption of the 
capsule. To be noted, individual results and f2 calculations were provided in the applicant's response. 
In addition, new dissolution data were provided with 900 ml media showing comparable results. 
To support that the slower dissolution has no impact in vivo, the 100 mg capsule was over-
encapsulated, creating a capsule with a slower in vitro dissolution. The 100 mg capsule and the 100 
mg over-encapsulated capsule appeared to be bioequivalent in vivo. However, it is questionable 
whether this can be extrapolated to the 50 mg capsule, as the over-encapsulated capsule is not 
bioequivalent to 2 x 50 mg tablets, while these tablets were bioequivalent to the 100 mg (normal) 100 
mg capsule formulation. Furthermore, the strategy applied includes an indirect comparison, i.e., first 
bridging the 50 mg tablet to the 100 mg capsule and additionally a waiver of additional strengths for 
the 50 mg capsule.  
The bridging strategy was therefore not fully understood, and the applicant has provided an additional 
justification, i.e.: 
- as a 200 mg loading dose was intended to be applied, the 100 mg capsule, being the highest 
strength, was used for comparisons, instead of the 50 mg capsule, 
- Bioequivalence has been shown between the 50 mg clinical trial tablet and the 100 mg capsule. This 
100 capsule contained the same blend as the 50 mg capsule intended to be marketed. Linear 
pharmacokinetics has been shown over at least the 20 – 100 mg single dose range. In principle, 
bioequivalence may also be expected between the 50 mg capsule intended to be marketed and the 50 
mg clinical trial tablet if the similarity in dissolution between the 50 and 100 mg capsule has been 
shown. However, dissolution appeared to be faster for the 50 mg capsule compared to the 100 mg 
capsule (and even faster for the 30 mg capsule which was also used in clinical trials). As the same 
blend is used in both capsules, this difference can be attributed to the capsule shell. Still, as 
comparable in vitro dissolution has not been shown, it may be of concern that results cannot be 
extrapolated between the 50 mg clinical trial tablet and the 50 mg capsule intended to be marketed. 
However, plasma concentration data were available for the 30, 50 and 100 mg capsules from different 
clinical studies, although for the 50 mg capsule, only sparse sampling data from a recently completed 
target occupancy study (study B7981045). Dose normalised concentration-time curves showed 
comparable curves. 
- With regard to dissolution, the 100 mg and the 30 mg capsule are the extremes, and the dissolution 
profile for the 50 mg capsule is bracketed by those two strengths. Statistical analysis by inter-study 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

comparison for the 30 and 100 mg capsule showed that ratios of adjusted geometric means of dose-
normalised AUCinf and Cmax were close to 1, indicating only 5-6% difference (to be noted, the data on 
the 50 mg capsule were not taken into account in this analyse as due to sparse sampling Cmax could 
have been missed). Additionally, a PBPK model was developed using Simcyp platform (version 22, 
release 1) with input parameters derived from in vitro and in vivo studies and was based upon 
physiologically based principles and justifiable assumptions. Model verification shows a good prediction. 
Simulations predicted that the 50 and 100-mg capsules could be considered bioequivalent. 
Additionally, the comparable extent of absorption from the 50 and 100 mg capsules was confirmed 
using the TIM-1 gastrointestinal simulator. Although the TIM-1 gastric dissolution profiles confirmed 
the faster dissolution from the 50 mg capsule, the cumulative bio-accessibility of 50 mg and 100 mg 
ritlecitinib capsules was comparable.  
Therefore, the bridge between the 50 mg clinical trial tablet and the 50 mg capsule intended to be 
marketed is supported. 
With regard to the dose-proportional 10 mg tablet, no dissolution data could be retrieved to support 
the waiver for the 10 mg tablet vs. the 50 mg tablet. These data were additionally provided, showing 
comparable dissolution at pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8, paddle, 50 rpm, using 900 ml media. 
Distribution 
Ritlecitinib binding to plasma proteins is low, with a free fraction of 86% (14% unbound). Binding is 
mainly to serum albumin.  
The blood to plasma ratio was 1.62, indicating distribution to red blood cells. 
After i.v. administration, a volume of distribution is observed of 74 l, indicating considerable tissue 
distribution. 
Based on rat data, biliary excretion of ritlecitinib is limited, distribution to brain tissue is limited and 
ritlecitinib is excreted into the milk.  
Metabolism 
In vitro, metabolite profiling of ritlecitinib in liver microsomes and hepatocytes indicated that CYP3A4/5 
was identified as the primary CYP contributing to ritlecitinib metabolism through combined formation 
fractions of 302-2 and PF-07297983 (302-3, M4) with an overall CYP3A fm 0.29. Lesser contributions 
to ritlecitinib metabolism identified were CYP2C8 fm 0.091, CYP1A2 fm 0.068, and CYP2C9 fm 0.016. 
Furthermore, multiple glutathione S-transferases are involved in the metabolism (i.e., cytosolic GST 
A1/3, M1/3/5, P1, S1, T2, Z1, and microsomal Membrane Associated Proteins involved in Eicosanoid 
and glutathione metabolism MAPEG 1/2/3). However, functional variants in GST P1 (*B, *C) and null 
genotypes in GST M1 and T1 did not show significant differences in AUC compared to wild-type GST 
P1*A, M1, or T1. 
The in vivo mass balance of ritlecitinib was evaluated after a single oral dose of 14C-ritlecitinib 200 mg 
containing approximately 300 nCi 14C (i.e., radio-labelled ritlecitinib). In a second period, subjects 
received a single oral dose of unlabelled ritlecitinib 200 mg followed at tmax (about 0.5 h post-oral 
dose) by an i.v. dose of 14C-ritlecitinib 60 μg containing approximately 300 nCi 14C (i.e., radio-labelled 
ritlecitinib) to evaluate the absolute bioavailability. In both periods, fasting conditions were applied. 
In plasma, ritlecitinib was the most abundant drug compound (about 30% of total drug-related 
materials), with the M2 (cysteine conjugate) as the major circulating metabolite showing abundance of 
about 17%. Other minor circulating drug-related components included glutathione-related metabolites 
and downstream oxidations. The abundance of the other metabolites identified in human plasma was

trace or minor (<10%). No individual clearance pathway contributed ≥25% of systemic clearance. 
However, approximately 35% of the plasma-associated radioactivity was non-extractable, associated 
with a protein pellet, and could not be identified. This raises a concern that major or some other 
metabolites may be circulating in plasma. However, the applicant explained the high percentage of 
non-extractable radioactivity plasma by off-target binding of ritlecitinib to albumin. The total binding of 
ritlecitinib to albumin only makes a low fraction of the available albumin in patients, and only 0.6% of 
the administered dose in the human ADME study is bound to albumin. These estimations support that 
binding to albumin will be clinically negligible (see further pre-clinical section). 
The total recovery of the orally administered radioactive dose for 240 h post-dose (n=5) was 
85.6±9.2%, with 66.1±13.4% in the urine and 19.5±4.0% in the faeces. 
In urine, hydroxylated M4 and N-acetyl cysteine conjugate M3 were the main metabolites, representing 
16.3 and 10.3 % of the administered dose, respectively. Other minor metabolites observed in urine 
were the glutathione-related M2 (4.6%), M1(4.0%) and 423(2.0%), downstream oxidative metabolites 
336-3 (6.5%), M5 (3.3%), 320-1 (2.3%), 318-2 (1.5%), oxidative glucuronide 512 (1.1%) and 
ritlecitinib (2.7%). Renal clearance of ritlecitinib accounted for approximately 4% of total clearance. 
In faeces, glutathione-related remnants and various hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites were 
identified, but no single metabolite was greater than 1% of the administered dose. Half of the fraction 
in faeces could not be identified as being non-extractable and associated with a protein pellet. 
The main circulating metabolite in plasma is the cysteine conjugate M2, but it represents only about 
17% of drug-related material in plasma. After once-daily dosing of 200 mg ritlecitinib, a steady state 
for the M2 metabolite is achieved at day 6. Tmax at steady state was about 2 h and Cmin about 2.8 
ng/ml. Cysteine conjugate M2 is pharmacologically inactive against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2 and TEC 
family kinases. 
Elimination 
Ritlecitinib is eliminated with an elimination half-life of about 1.3 - 2.3 h. Clearance after a single iv 
dose was estimated to be about 44 l/h and CL/F 66 – 77l/h. However, PopPK analysis (final model) 
indicated a Cl/F of 107 l/h. It is observed that ritlecitinib shows non-stationary PK characteristics, 
where ritlecitinib CL changes following multiple doses resulting in a lower CL relative to after single 
doses. This would not be in line with the observed data from the single-dose study and the final popPK 
analysis. The difference has been clarified because the CL/F in the popPK model represents the 
clearance without inhibition. Comparison with Cl/F at the low dose of 5 mg, a dose at which 
concentration inhibition is considered minimal, indicated comparable clearance values. Furthermore, 
the non-stationary PK was accounted for in the popPK model. 
Special populations 
PK data and population PK analysis were used to evaluate the impact of covariates on the PK of 
ritlecitinib. 
Renal impairment: The PK of ritlecitinib has been evaluated in subjects with severe renal impaired 
function. The ANOVA analysis indicated that AUCtau and Cmax were 55% and 44% higher in subjects 
with severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. 
The difference in exposure falls within the estimated 0.5 – 2.0-fold range of clinical insignificance. The 
SmPC indicates that no dose adjustment is required for subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment, which is agreed from a PK point of view. 
Hepatic impairment: The PK of ritlecitinib has been evaluated in subjects with a moderate hepatic 
impaired function (Child-Pugh B score). The ANOVA Inclusion of the data in popPK analysis indicated

that AUCtau and Cmax in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment were 18.5% and 4% higher, 
respectively, compared to healthy subjects. 
The difference in exposure falls within the estimated 0.5 – 2.0-fold range of clinical insignificance. The 
SmPC indicates that no dose adjustment is required for subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) and 
moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, which is agreed from a PK point of view. Ritlecitinib is 
contraindicated in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. 
In study B7981016, 1 subject with moderate hepatic impairment showed a very pronounced higher 
exposure than the other subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No clear explanation could be 
given for the pronounced higher result. However, considering variability in the total population, such a 
higher value may be expected by coincidence. 
Gender: The popPK analysis identified gender as a non-significant covariate on ritlecitinib 
pharmacokinetics. 
Ethnicity/Race: The popPK analysis identified race/ethnicity (Asian/Black/White/Other, Japanese/non-
Japanese, Asia/Europe/North America/Rest of the world) as a non-significant covariate on ritlecitinib 
PK. 
Age Elderly/adolescents: The popPK analysis identified age (12 – 73 years) as a non-significant 
covariate on ritlecitinib PK. The SmPC indicates that no dose adjustment is required for adolescents 12 
to < 18 years of age and for the elderly, which is agreed from a PK point of view. 
In the popPK analysis, 69 subjects of age 65–74 years were included, and no subject over 75 years of 
age was available in the analysis dataset. 
Bodyweight: The popPK analysis identified body weight as a significant covariate on ritlecitinib PK. A 
subject with a body weight of 47 kg had a 45% higher exposure, while a subject with a body weight of 
101 kg had a 30% lower exposure. These differences fall within the estimated 0.5 – 2.0-fold range of 
clinical insignificance. As requested, the clinical relevance of exposures of subjects with an extreme 
body weight outside this 47 – 101 kg range, especially for adolescents, has been justified, i.e. based 
upon simulations, patients with a body weight of 32.6 – 131 kg would fall within the 0.5 – 2.0 
exposure range, which is considered still efficacious and safe. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Ritlecitinib is metabolised by multiple isoforms of GSTs and CYPs (CYP3A4 is the predominant CYP 
responsible for the metabolism with contributions from CYP2C8, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9). Regarding 
GSTs, functional variants in GST P1 (*B, *C) and null genotypes in GST M1 and T1 did not show 
significant differences in AUC compared to wild-type GST P1*A, M1, or T1, indicating a low potential of 
interaction with this pathway. 
Administration of 200 mg q.d. itraconazole (strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor) with ritlecitinib (30 mg, 
single dose) resulted in a 15% and 3% increase in AUCinf and Cmax of ritlecitinib. 
Administration of 600 mg q.d. rifampin (strong CYP3A and P-gp/UGT inducer, 2C19, 2C9 and 2B6 
inducer, in vitro inducer GSTs) resulted in a 44% decrease in AUCinf and a 25% decrease in Cmax of 
ritlecitinib. 
These differences in exposure fall within the estimated 0.5 – 2.0-fold range of clinical insignificance. 
Co-administration of ritlecitinib with acid-reducing agents is highly unlikely to impact its solubility and 
subsequent absorption, given its high solubility profile across a range of pH levels. 
In vitro, ritlecitinib was not a significant competitive inhibitor of CYP enzymes. Ritlecitinib showed in 
vitro time-dependent inhibition versus CYP3A and CYP1A2. Ritlecitinib exhibited a potential to induce

CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. A low inhibition towards glutathione S-
transferase isoforms is observed in vitro, suggesting no significant impact in vivo; however, the 
quantitative translation to in vivo is currently not understood. 
The M2 inactive metabolite was not a significant competitive inhibitor of CYP enzymes. M2 did not 
exhibit in vitro time-dependent inhibition versus CYP3A and CYP1A2 or other CYPs, and did not exhibit 
a potential to induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. 
In vitro studies have shown the inhibitory potential of ritlecitinib for hepatic transporters (e.g., OCT1 
[IC50=3.7 µM]), renal transporters (e.g., OCT2 [IC50=55 µM], OAT3 [IC50=41.3 µM], MATE1 [IC50=51 
µM] and MATE2K [IC50=48 µM]) and BCRP [IC50=27.0 µM]. 
In vitro, ritlecitinib and M2 demonstrated no significant inhibition of the major UGT enzymes. And 
ritlecitinib did not significantly inhibit SULT or GST enzymes. 
The time-dependent inhibition versus CYP3A was confirmed in vivo, showing an increased AUCinf and 
Cmax of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam (single 2 mg dose) by 169 and 81%, respectively, after 200 
mg q.d. administration of ritlecitinib. Although in vitro, ritlecitinib may also induce CYP3A4, these data 
indicate that ritlecitinib is in vivo a time-dependent moderate inhibitor for CYP3A. 
The time-dependent inhibition versus CYP1A2 was confirmed in vivo, showing an increased AUCinf and 
Cmax of the CYP1A2 substrate caffeine (single 100 mg dose) by 165 and 10%, respectively, after 200 
mg q.d. administration of ritlecitinib. Although in vitro, ritlecitinib may also induce CYP1A2, these data 
indicate that ritlecitinib is in vivo a time-dependent moderate inhibitor for CYP1A2. 
The potential to induce CYP2C9 was not confirmed in vivo, as AUCinf and Cmax of the CYP2C9 substrate 
tolbutamide (single 500 mg dose) were not significantly affected after 200 mg q.d. administration of 
ritlecitinib. These data indicate that ritlecitinib is in vivo, not an inducer of CYP2C9. 
The potential to induce CYP2B6 was not confirmed in vivo, as 200 mg q.d. administration of ritlecitinib 
did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz (CYP2B6 substrate, single 50 mg dose). 
These data indicate that ritlecitinib is in vivo, not an inducer of CYP2B6. 
Ritlecitinib 200 mg qd decreased the BCRP, OATP1B1 and OAT3 substrate rosuvastatin (10 mg single 
dose) AUCinf and Cmax by 13 and 27%, respectively, and urinary rosuvastatin excretion was not 
affected (Clr ratio 106%). Intestinal BCRP acts as an efflux transporter limiting rosuvastatin 
absorption, while liver BCRP actively excretes rosuvastatin into the bile. OATP1B1 is an uptake 
transporter expressed on the sinusoidal side of hepatocyte, providing rosuvastatin access to 
hepatocyte and subsequent metabolism and elimination. Hence, potential inhibition of BCRP and 
OATP1B1 by ritlecitinib would be expected to increase rosuvastatin plasma exposure. However, 
rosuvastatin exposures did not increase when rosuvastatin was co-administered after multiple doses of 
ritlecitinib. Hence, the inhibition potential of ritlecitinib for BCRP and OATP1B1 transporters is low.  
Furthermore, rosuvastatin is a substrate for OAT3, contributing to its active renal secretion. Any OAT3 
inhibition is expected to reduce the renal clearance of rosuvastatin significantly. However, renal 
clearance of rosuvastatin was comparable in the absence and presence of multiple doses of ritlecitinib, 
suggesting minimal inhibition potential risk of ritlecitinib for the OAT3 transporter. 
Furthermore, the biomarkers coproporphyrin 1 for OATP1B1/1B3, N1-methylnicotinamide for 
OCT2/MATE1/MATE2K and pyridoxic acid for OAT1/3 biomarker were not significantly affected, 
indicating a low inhibition potency towards these transporters. 
The inhibitory potential of ritlecitinib for the hepatic transporter OCT1 was confirmed in vivo, as AUCinf 
and Cmax of the OCT1 substrate sumatriptan (single 25 mg dose) increased with 30 and 13%, 
respectively, after co-administration of 400 mg ritlecitinib. When ritlecitinib was administered 8 h 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 74/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
before sumatriptan, the sumatriptan exposure increased by 50%. These data indicate that ritlecitinib is 
an inhibitor of OCT1 in vivo. 
To exclude a possible interaction with oral contraceptives, in vivo ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel 
30/150 µg (single dose) was co-administered with 50 mg q.d. ritlecitinib. Ritlecitinib decreased the 
ethinyl estradiol AUCinf and Cmax by 2 and 8%, respectively, and decreased the levonorgestrel AUCinf 
and Cmax by 12 and 20%, respectively. These changes were not considered clinically relevant. 
The potential for interactions has been adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.5. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ritlecitinib irreversibly and selectively inhibits Janus kinase (JAK) 3 and the tyrosine kinase expressed 
in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) family by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. In 
cellular settings, ritlecitinib specifically inhibits γ-common cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21) 
signalling through JAK3-dependent common-γ chain receptors. Additionally, ritlecitinib inhibits TEC 
family of kinases, resulting in reduced cytolytic activity of NK cells and CD8+ T cells.  
JAK3 and TEC family mediated signalling pathways are both involved in alopecia areata pathogenesis, 
although complete pathophysiology is still not understood. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Data from the main clinical study B07981015 in participants with AA were used for the exploration of 
pharmacodynamics (PD). The pathophysiology of AA as an auto-immune disease supports the 
relevance of JAK inhibition in the treatment of this disorder. Ritlecitinib is an oral covalent irreversible 
inhibitor of the 5 TEC family kinases (BMX, BTK, ITK, TEC, TXK) and JAK3. It lacks activity against 
JAK1 and JAK2, leading to a narrower spectrum of cytokine inhibition. JAK3 and TEC kinases regulate 
the response of CD8+ T, NK and mast cells thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of AA. 
Ritlecitinib lacks activity against JAK1 and JAK2, inhibiting only the 6 γ-common cytokines IL-2, IL-4, 
IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-2. The spider graphs in Figure 6 and Figure 7 represent the theoretical 
projected inhibition profiles of various signalling pathways, some of which have been shown to be 
important in autoimmune diseases. Values on the axes represent the projected average percent 
inhibition of each cytokine during a dosing period. These values are calculated based on the IC50 
values obtained in whole blood for each cytokine and the average concentration measured in the 
plasma of subjects dosed with JAK inhibitors. Although the relevance of selective inhibition of a specific 
JAK enzyme to clinical effects is not currently known, ritlecitinib shows a pattern of effects on immune 
cell signalling that is differentiated from approved JAK inhibitors by sparing JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2.  
Since the pivotal study was dose-ranging, the relationship between concentration and its effect on 
symptoms (i.e. hair loss) was analysed in that study (see the section on Clinical Efficacy for details). In 
the pivotal study, the participants were randomised to 6 treatment arms: ritlecitinib 50 or 30mg QD 
(either with or without loading dose of 200mg QD during the first 4 weeks, referred to as 200/50 of 
200/30), ritlecitinib 10 mg QD and placebo. The placebo-controlled phase lasted 24 weeks after which 
participants of the placebo arm were blindly assigned to either 200/50 mg or 50 mg treatment group. 
The participants of other arms remained on the originally assigned dose. This extension phase lasted 
another 24 weeks (through week 48).  
Changes in biomarkers 
In addition to assessing the clinical manifestations of AA, the pivotal study also measured several PD 
biomarkers such as a change from baseline in interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) up to 
Assessment report

Week 24, percentage and absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets and change from baseline in 
immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) up to Week 48. 
All treatment groups showed small and variable changes in IP-10 from baseline up to Week 24. At 
Week 24, the mean change from baseline was dose-dependent, ranging from a maximum (ng/mL) of -
37.4 in 200/50 mg to -6.8 in placebo. A decrease of absolute lymphocyte (subset) levels of CD3, CD4 
and CD8 were observed. After the initial dose-dependent decrease, the levels partially recovered and 
remained stable up to week 48, not always in a dose-dependent way. CD19 (B lymphocyte) did not 
appear to decrease in either treatment group. There was a dose-dependent early decrease in CD16/56 
(NK cells), which was the most apparent in groups that had received a 200 mg loading dose (200/50 
mg and 200/30 mg) of ritlecitinib. The dose-dependent effect was less obvious in subsequent weeks. 
Finally, there were no clinically concerning changes in immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) up to Week 48 
across all groups.

Concentration response analyses 
A longitudinal concentration-response analysis using Cav and the raw SALT score was conducted to 
characterise the concentration-response relationship, temporal characteristics of the response and 
covariates in the study population, which can account for variability in SALT score reduction. A 
combined data set which included data from completed studies (B7931005 and B7981015) and 
ongoing study B7981032 (data cutoff date of 02 Jun 2021) was used for the analysis. 
As the SALT score represents a bounded scale (0 to 100), the non-boundary data were scaled between 
0 to 1 and transformed using Aranda-Ordaz flexible link function to normalise the skewed distribution 
of a bounded SALT score data. A general nonlinear mixed-effects model was then constructed based on 
the transformed SALT score. The final model was a semi-mechanistic model that described the placebo 
and drug response utilising indirect response models with transit compartments to characterise the 
delay in response. The drug effect was described by a 2 parameter Emax-EC50 model.

The Cav during the time interval between the previous SALT score and the current SALT score were 
used as the PK concentration metric for the efficacy. Given that ritlecitinib irreversibly inhibits 
JAK3/TEC kinases and the improvement in SALT score is the gradual outcome of their modulation of 
the downstream signalling pathways, the applicant assumed that the efficacy is not sensitive to the 
short-time fluctuation in concentration, such as Cmax, and is rather influenced by average 
concentration over a period of time (i.e., Cav). 
The concentration at half maximum effect (EC50) estimated as in Cav was 53.6 ng/ml, similar to the 
Cav of a 50 mg q.d. dose (52 ng/ml). Simulations indicated that an additionally improved efficacy is 
expected by increasing the maintenance dose to greater than 50 mg q.d. (see Figure 8). 
Figure 8: Placebo-adjusted responder rate for SALT ≤20 for various maintenance doses 
The use of a loading dose (200 mg q.d. for 4 weeks) resulted only in an earlier onset of effect. The 
clinical onset times were 6 weeks with loading dose vs. 9 weeks with non-loading for 50 mg q.d.. The 
loading dose of 200 mg for 4 weeks achieved the clinical onset of SALT ≤20, 3 weeks faster for 50 mg 
q.d. dose group. However, the differentiation in the SALT ≤20 response was diminished by week 48, 
such that the responder rates were similar between loading vs non-loading dose regimens at week 48. 
Further, to evaluate the possibility of maintenance therapy with ritlecitinib 30 mg after remission has 
been achieved with 50mg, a model-based clinical trial simulation approach was used to quantitatively 
assess the potential exposure-driven decrease in efficacy when the ritlecitinib dose is reduced from 50 
mg to 30 mg. A simulation was conducted utilising the final longitudinal concentration-response (LCR) 
model of the SALT score based on data from studies B7931005, B7981015, and B7981032 to predict 
the proportion of SALT ≤20 responders on 50 mg maintaining their SALT ≤20 response after a dose 
reduction to 30 mg. The modelling data indicate that loss of response should be expected when the 
dose is reduced from 50 mg to 30 mg: more patients on the 50 mg dose maintained the response at 
week 156 as compared to patients whose dose was lowered (95%, 95%CI [90, 99] vs. 81%, 95%CI 
[72, 88]) (Table 5).

Table 5: Model-predicted proportion of responders maintaining SALT ≤20 response after dose tapering 
The effect of dose interruption on SALT≤20 was analysed using a simulation analysis, from which it 
was concluded that dose interruptions in the 50 mg dose of ≥6 weeks could lead to decreases in 
average population response rates at Week 24. For the no dose interruption scenario, the responder 
rate for SALT ≤20 was 23.1%. This is the expected value for the responder rate when no participant 
missed a study visit, and no one skipped any ritlecitinib doses. The estimate was very similar to the 
observed value for 50 mg group in the B7981015 study (23.39%), after the exclusion of 6 participants 
missing due to COVID 19 and treating 5 participants missing due to reasons unrelated to COVID-19 as 
non-responders.  
The responder rate decreased for each of the various dose interruption scenarios, reflecting the impact 
of dose interruption on SALT ≤20 at Week 24 (Table 6). The impact of dose interruption was 
dependent upon both 1) the dose interruption start time and 2) the duration of the interruption. The 
impact was generally larger when the duration of interruption was ≥6 weeks. 
Table 6: Predicted proportions of patients with SALT ≤20 at week 24 for various dose interruption 
scenarios for ritlecitinib 50 mg 
RR=’response rate’, or proportion of patients with SALT≤20. 
The effect of dose interruptions after the target clinical response (SALT ≤10) is achieved was also 
analysed using simulation, concluding that after the target clinical response of SALT ≤10 is achieved, 
dose interruptions of ≥6 weeks will result in the loss of the SALT ≤10 response in some patients. 
Simulations assumed that the offset rate was equal to the onset rate of the patient. The final model 
was used to simulate responses up to 96 weeks to ensure a stable target clinical response. The dose 
was interrupted following 96 weeks, and changes in SALT score were collected. The proportion of 
responders losing SALT ≤10 response was further summarised according to the duration of treatment

interruption in Table 7. Based on the model prediction, ≥14% of the responders were predicted to lose 
response when treatment was discontinued for ≥6 weeks, and almost half of the responders were 
predicted to lose response when treatment was discontinued for ≥16 weeks. 
Table 7: Proportion of responders losing SALT≤10 response for various dose interruption durations 
The applicant has updated the above analysis with the simulation to evaluate times to lose SALT ≤20 
response for SALT ≤10 responders. Also, in this updated simulation, all the participants were treated 
with ritlecitinib 50 mg QD until Week 96 to ensure the SALT response had reached a plateau. However, 
the SALT score was now simulated for every week up to Week 144 (up to 48 weeks of treatment 
interruption) to capture any changes in SALT score after treatment withdrawal. The proportion of SALT 
≤10 responders losing SALT ≤20 response for various treatment interruption durations is summarised 
in Table 8. Based on this summary, 66% of SALT ≤10 responders are predicted to lose SALT ≤20 
response and 70% are predicted to lose SALT ≤10 response with up to 48 weeks of treatment 
interruption. The risk of losing SALT ≤20 response is <5% after treatment withdrawal for up to 6 
weeks, and it is >10% if treatment withdrawal is for 10 weeks or longer. 
Table 8: Cumulative proportion of SALT≤10 responders to 96 weeks of ritlecitinib 50mg QD treatment

Regarding the effect of ritlecitinib on platelets, a mean reduction from baseline counts of less than 
25% was observed for all ritlecitinib doses with respect to placebo (see Safety section). However, the 
effect appears to be saturated as all doses demonstrated a similar response without a clear dose-
response relationship. This level of change in platelet counts was not considered clinically significant in 
this population and is unlikely to result in increased risk of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, no further 
concentration-response modelling was conducted. 
Regarding the effect on lymphocytes, in the exposure-response modelling analysis showed that the 
200 mg loading dose regimen with 50 maintenance dosing was associated with a higher risk of 
lymphopenia than 50 flat dosing regimens. The prediction interval for Grade 2 lymphopenia contains 0

for the flat dosing but not for the matching loading doses dose regimens. The simulated probabilities 
(95%CI) for a lymphopenia when being on the 50 mg dose were: 15% (9.2% - 22%) for grade 1; 
2.9% (0 – 6.7%) for grade 2; 0 (0 – 0.8%) for grade 3; 0 for grade 4. For flat dosing regimens, the 
model describes a gradual descent to steady-state, where lymphocyte counts are predicted to remain 
until the end of dosing.  
For the analysis of first occurrences of treatment-emergent AEs, data were used from studies in 
healthy participants (B7981001, B7981003, B7981008, B7981022, B7981036), in AA participants 
(7931005, B7981015, B7981032) and Vitiligo participants (B7981019). The concentration metric used 
for the analysis was a time-weighted Cav which was determined as the cumulative AUC divided by the 
time of the adverse event. It was time-weighted to account for the assumed delay in PD effects 
following the change in ritlecitinib dose. The relationship between ritlecitinib concentration and 
treatment-emergent clinical safety endpoints, such as infections, were characterised using Poisson 
regression. 
For infections, the AE categories of interest were identified as moderate infections, severe infections 
and infections leading to discontinuation. The model-estimated slope for the effect of time-weighted 
Cav on the mean incidence of infection events was statistically significant (95% CI of estimate did not 
include zero). Over the range of relevant doses, an approximately 10-fold increase in ritlecitinib 
concentration (geometric mean Cav of 27 ng/mL [30 mg QD] vs. 257 ng/mL [200 mg QD]), was 
predicted to demonstrate an approximately 3-fold increase in the mean incidence of infections per 100 
patient-years (11.0 vs. 33.2, respectively). The mean (95% CI) incidence of infections per 100 patient 
years for chronic ritlecitinib administration of 30 mg and 50 mg QD was 11.0 (9.61, 12.7) and 13.5 
(11.9, 15.3), respectively.

Effect on the QT/QTc interval 
On the basis of the preclinical assessments and clinical assessments along with the concentration QT 
analysis, no evidence of any clinically meaningful QTc interval prolongation has been observed. The 
CQTc analysis results in humans indicated that the treatment with ritlecitinib is not associated with QTc 
prolongation. The upper bound of 90% CI for the ∆∆QTcF estimate was less than 10 msec across the 
entire investigated concentration range of ritlecitinib, including anticipated supratherapeutic 
concentrations (up to 3 times the Cmax of the highest dose currently being evaluated in Phase 3 
trials). 
The applicant requested a waiver for the Thorough QTc study for ritlecitinib based on the 
recommendations in E14 ICH Guideline (ref). The CHMP concurred with the applicant rationale to waive 
the Thorough QTc study under the condition that the marketed clinical dose does not exceed 200 mg.

of 90% CI for ∆∆QTcF estimates across the entire concentration range were all below 10 msec, which 
is the threshold for regulatory concern. The upper bound of 90% CI for ∆∆QTcF estimate at the 
supratherapeutic concentration was 3.06 msec and the value at the mean Cmax of the highest dose in 
study B7981001, 3-fold higher than the mean Cmax,ss for the highest therapeutic dose in AA 
population, was 4.13 msec (Table 9).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
By applying a longitudinal concentration-response analysis using Cav and raw SALT score to 
characterise the concentration-response relationship, an EC50 of 53.6 ng/ml (as the Cav) was 
estimated, which was comparable to the Cav after a 50 mg q.d. dose (i.e., 52.0 ng/ml).  
Simulation of various maintenance doses indicated that an additionally improved efficacy is expected 
by increasing the maintenance dose to greater than 50 mg q.d.. Mean exposure differences were 
considered acceptable because of intrinsic or extrinsic factors, which fall within the range of 0.5- to 2-
fold of the mean for the reference group. However, the longitudinal concentration-response analysis 
indicated that a 30 mg q.d. dose would provide less efficacy. The suggested acceptable 0.5-fold 
difference in exposure, which would translate in a 25 mg q.d. dose, will thus also provide less efficacy.  
Therefore the 0.5-fold cut-off being not clinically relevant was further justified, i.e. both the 30 mg and 
50 mg doses have been shown to be efficacious; however, the 50 mg group had a higher efficacy 
(proportion of participants who achieved severity of alopecia tool [SALT]≤10) compared to 30 mg. A 
subject receiving a 50 mg dose and ending at the lower 0.5-fold exposure due to variability (and 
covariates) would fall in the higher exposure and still efficacious range of a 30 mg dose. 
Simulations of a loading dose indicated that a loading dose would achieve the onset of efficacy faster, 
but the effect of the loading dose is not sustained on the long-term efficacy, as the response rates 
converge regardless of the presence of loading dose in the dose regimen. A loading dose of 200 mg for 
4 weeks followed by 50 mg q.d., resulted in a 3 weeks (6 vs 9 weeks) faster clinical onset (see further 
clinical efficacy and safety). 
In light of the above, the proposed dose recommendation of 50 mg once daily is supported by the 
CHMP. Also see clinical efficacy section for further results/discussion on the recommended dose. 
Ritlecitinib was administered as tablets in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 efficacy and safety study and long-
term safety study without regard to the timing of meals. The SmPC recommends the capsule intake 
once daily with or without food, which is agreed by the CHMP. 
Special populations 
PK data and population PK analysis were used to evaluate the impact of covariates on the PK of 
ritlecitinib.

Renal impairment: The SmPC indicates that no dose adjustment is required for subjects with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment, which is agreed from a PK point of view. 
Hepatic impairment: The SmPC indicates that no dose adjustment is required for subjects with mild 
(Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, which is agreed from a PK point of 
view. Ritlecitinib is contraindicated in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. 
In study B7981016, 1 subject with moderate hepatic impairment showed a very pronounced higher 
exposure than the other subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No clear explanation could be 
given for the pronounced higher result. However, considering variability in the total population, such a 
higher value may be expected by coincidence. 
Gender: The popPK analysis identified gender as a non-significant covariate on ritlecitinib 
pharmacokinetics. 
Ethnicity/Race: The popPK analysis identified race/ethnicity (Asian/Black/White/Other, Japanese/non-
Japanese, Asia/Europe/North America/Rest of the world) as a non-significant covariate on ritlecitinib 
PK. 
Age Elderly/adolescents: The popPK analysis identified age (12 – 73 years) as a non-significant 
covariate on ritlecitinib PK. The SmPC indicates that no dose adjustment is required for adolescents 12 
to < 18 years of age and for the elderly, which is agreed from a PK point of view. 
In the popPK analysis, 69 subjects of age 65–74 years were included, and no subject over 75 years of 
age was available in the analysis dataset. The section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that 
there are limited data in patients ≥65 years of age. 
Bodyweight: The popPK analysis identified body weight as a significant covariate on ritlecitinib PK. A 
subject with a body weight of 47 kg had a 45% higher exposure, while a subject with a body weight of 
101 kg had a 30% lower exposure. These differences fall within the estimated 0.5 – 2.0-fold range of 
clinical insignificance. As requested, the clinical relevance of exposures of subjects with an extreme 
body weight outside this 47 – 101 kg range, especially for adolescents, has been justified, i.e. based 
upon simulations, patients with a body weight of 32.6 – 131 kg would fall within the 0.5 – 2.0 
exposure range, which is considered still efficacious and safe. 
The potential for interactions has been adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.5. 
Pharmacodynamics (PD) 
Ritlecitinib is a JAK-inhibitor with selective activity against JAK3 and TEC kinases, as opposed to JAK1 
and JAK2 activity.  
Although the choice of lymphocytes, immunoglobulins and IP-10 as PD biomarkers can be theoretically 
deduced from the mechanism of action of ritlecitinib, no explicit rationale was given by the applicant 
for the choice of these specific biomarkers. The data provided by the applicant do not allow for 
differentiation between different classes of JAK-inhibitors. Nevertheless, since this information does not 
currently provide additional information for this application, the issue was not further pursued. The 
decrease in lymphocytes which might be relevant for safety is discussed in the Safety section. 
Information on lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulins were reflected in the section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. This is agreed.  
Limited data are available on the effect of treatment interruption, and loss of response after the 
treatment target of SALT≤10 has been reached. The applicant, therefore, chose a modelling approach, 
which is acknowledged. The exposure-efficacy analysis characterised the longitudinal relationship 
between ritlecitinib exposure and SALT score based on studies B7931005, B7981015 and B7981032. 
Cavg (the average drug concentration during the time interval between the previous and current SALT

score) was selected as the exposure metric, which is acceptable. Goodness-of-fit and VPC plots 
indicate that the developed model adequately described the observed data. Based on the simulations, 
the response rate at Week 24 could be influenced by dose interruption. The reduction in effect was 
larger when the interruption was longer than 6 weeks. The proposed statement in SmPC section 4.2, 
stating that ‘a treatment interruption for less than 6 weeks is not expected to result in significant loss 
of regrown scalp hair’, is acceptable.  
A simulation analysis indicated that a loss of response would be expected when the dose is reduced 
from 50 mg to 30 mg. Considering the greater efficacy seen with a dose of 50 mg as compared to 30 
mg, the relatively low infection risk for both 50 and 30 mg of ritlecitinib in the general AA population 
and in the elderly; that elderly is not a major target population for ritlecitinib given the demographic 
characteristics and the presence of a warning in Section 4.4 regarding the infection risk, a maintenance 
dose of 50 mg is, overall, considered appropriate.  
The relationship between ritlecitinib exposure and lymphocyte count was explored using the developed 
semi-mechanistic Friberg model. The results suggest that a 200 mg loading dose regimen was 
associated with a higher risk of lymphopenia than 30 or 50 mg flat dosing regimen. Changes in B 
lymphocytes were only marginal and tended to return to baseline. The applicant considered decreased 
platelets and lymphocytes as ADRs, and this is agreed upon (see Safety section). In addition, 
monitoring advice is given in the SmPC. Upper respiratory tract infections are considered ADRs, given 
the differences in the occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections between placebo and ritlecitinib 
50 mg, and the dose-response relation in the 48-week data. 
A positive exposure-response relationship was identified for the incidence of infection and rash events. 
For herpes zoster infections, the relationship was not statistically significant. However, this should be 
interpreted cautiously since only a limited number of herpes zoster infections were available for 
analysis.    
The applicant has provided concentration-QT modelling using time-matched PK-ECG data from 
SAD/MAD study B7981001 as a waiver for the TQT study, in line with the previously received CHMP 
scientific advice.  
For model development, the general principles laid out in the white paper by Garnett et al. (2017) 
were followed, which is endorsed. The data were fitted to a pre-specified linear mixed-effects model. 
Sufficiently high multiple clinically relevant concentrations were tested.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of ritlecitinib have been adequately characterised. The exposure-
response analyses support the choice of 50 mg QD flat dose without needing a 200 mg loading dose.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical programme to support the efficacy of ritlecitinib in Alopecia Areata (AA) consisted of 3 
studies: 1 pivotal phase 2/3 study (B7981015), 1 supportive phase 2a study (B7931005), and 1 long-
term phase 3 study (B7981032), all in participants with AA (see Table 10). In this section, clinical 
studies will be denoted with the last 3 digits of their identifier.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
Dose-response has been studied within the single pivotal trial (015). Instead of a dose-response study, 
the pivotal study was preceded by a proof-of-concept study (005), including ritlecitinib in a single dose 
regimen (200/50 mg QD) in comparison to placebo.

A Phase 2a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety profile of PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 in subjects with moderate to 
severe alopecia areata with a single-blind extension period and a cross-over open label 
extension period. 
The primary objective of study B7931005 was to evaluate the efficacy of ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) 
and of brepocitinib (PF-06700841) as compared to placebo, on change in SALT score from 0-24 weeks 
(primary outcome), in adults with severe AA (SALT≥50).  Results of the brepocitinib study arm are not 
reported here. 
The design of study 005 consisted of 3 periods: a 24-week double-blind treatment period, a 4-week 
‘drug holiday’ followed by a 24-week single-blind extension period, and a 24-week cross-over open-
label period. Patients who had at least 50% hair loss of the scalp (SALT score ≥50%) without evidence 
of hair regrowth within the previous 6 months and a current episode of hair loss not over 7 years were 
randomised (2:1) to ritlecitinib or to matching placebo (cq. brepocitinib and placebo, the placebo 
groups were combined for analysis). Patients and investigators were blinded for treatment allocation.  
The primary endpoint was the change in SALT score from weeks 0-24. Secondary outcomes calculated 
post-hoc included improvements >2 grade in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for eyelash and eyebrow hair 
growth and SALT10. The induction dose of ritlecitinib was 200 mg QD for 4 weeks, followed by 20 
weeks of 50 mg QD. The dosing regimen for the proof-of-concept study was informed by the non-
clinical safety results in dogs and by in vitro percent inhibition of IL-15 and IL-21. 
The 24-week double-blind phase was followed by a 4-week period without treatment (‘treatment 
holiday’). Only patients who had completed the double-blind phase were eligible for the single-blind 
extension phase. Patients who were responders (change from baseline in SALT>30%) were treated 
with placebo up to 24 weeks but were retreated with their original compound (ritlecitinib or 
brepocitinib) in case of an increase in SALT of >30%. Non-responders continued to receive the original 
compound they had been allocated to. In the cross-over part of the study, patients who were non-
responders in the single-blind extension phase, and were still non-responders at week 52, were 
switched to the alternative experimental compound. Responders, however, directly entered the 4 
weeks follow-up period. 
At baseline, there were 48 participants included in the ritlecitinib group and 47 participants included in 
the placebo group. The mean age of the participants in the ritlecitinib group and placebo group was 
similar, with 37 and 38 years of age, respectively. In the ritlecitinib group, 77% of participants were 
female, as compared to 62% in the placebo group. Most patients were of Caucasian origin, in 
ritlecitinib (79%) and placebo (96%) groups. The median duration of the current AA episode was about 
2,5 years in both groups. The baseline SALT score was at least 50% in both treatment groups, and the 
average SALT score at baseline was about 89%. About 40% of patients in each group had AT or AU.  
After 24 weeks, 34 (72%) of the patients in the placebo group and 45 (94%) of the patients in the 
ritlecitinib group had completed the study. In each group, 2 patients had discontinued treatment due 
to an AE. 
The Least Squares Means (LSM) difference (95%CI) in SALT score (primary outcome) from baseline up 
to week 24 between ritlecitinib 200/50 and placebo was 31% (19% - 44%) with a p<0.0001. The 
change from baseline in SALT score in the placebo group was 1.4% (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Change in SALT score from baseline to week 24 in study 005 
The proportion of patients who had a SALT10 response at week 24 (post-hoc calculation of primary 
endpoint in the pivotal study), was 25% in the ritlecitinib 200/50 group and 0% in the placebo group, 
with a p<0.001. Also, in a post-hoc analysis, among participants with an abnormal eyebrow 
assessment (EBA) score at baseline, 20% of participants in the 200/50 mg group had at least a 2-
grade improvement in or normal EBA at Week 24, compared with 7.5% for the placebo group. 
Similarly, among participants with an abnormal eyelash (ELA) at Baseline, 22% of participants in the 
200/50 mg group had at least a 2-grade improvement in or normal ELA at Week 24, compared with 
8.6% for the placebo group. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
Title of study 
A phase 2b/3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of PF-06651600 in adult and adolescent Alopecia Areata (AA) subjects With 50% or 
greater scalp hair loss 
The participants were randomised to 6 treatment arms: ritlecitinib 50 or 30mg mg QD (either with or 
without loading dose of 200mg QD during the first 4 weeks, referred to as 200/50 of 200/30), 
ritlecitinib 10 mg QD and placebo (Figure 11). The placebo-controlled phase lasted 24 weeks, after 
which participants of the placebo arm were blindly assigned to either 200/50 mg or 50 mg treatment 
group. The participants of other arms remained on the originally assigned dose. This Extension Phase 
lasted another 24 weeks, through Week 48.

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
The study participants were adults and adolescents with a diagnosis of AA. Adolescent participants, 
between 12 and <18 years of age, were recruited outside of the EU. 
The main inclusion criteria were: 
•  Male or female participants ≥12 years of age at the time of informed consent/assent. 
•  A clinical diagnosis of AA with no other aetiology of scalp hair loss (e.g. telogen effluvium, 
androgenic alopecia). 
•  At least 50% hair loss of the scalp as measured by SALT, including alopecia totalis (complete 
scalp hair loss) and alopecia universalis (complete scalp, facial, and body hair loss), without 
evidence of terminal hair regrowth within 6 months at both screening and baseline visits. 
• 
The current episode of scalp hair loss is less than 10 years. 
The main exclusion criteria were: 
•  Active systemic diseases that could cause hair loss (e.g., lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, 
systemic sclerosis, lichen planus, etc.). 
•  Certain psychiatric conditions such as suicidality in the past year of a current major psychiatric 
disorder. Participants with a suicidal risk in the past underwent a risk assessment in order to 
participate in the study. 
•  Hearing loss with progression over the previous 5 years, sudden hearing loss, middle or inner 
ear disease, or other auditory condition considered acute, fluctuating, or progressive. 
• 
Previous use of any JAK inhibitor for use in any disease indication or any non-B-cell selective 
lymphocyte-depleting agent. 
•  Current or recent history of clinically significant severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, 
hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, endocrine (particularly thyroid disease

which can be associated with hair loss), pulmonary, cardiovascular, 
immunologic/rheumatologic or neurologic disease.  
•  Any present solid or hematological malignancies or history of malignancies, except for 
adequately treated or excised non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin or 
cervical carcinoma in situ. 
•  History (single episode) of disseminated herpes zoster or disseminated herpes simplex, or a 
recurrent (more than one episode of) localised, dermatomal herpes zoster. 
•  Adolescent participants 12 to <18 years old without a documented history of VZV vaccination 
or presence of VZV IgG Ab. 
•  History of systemic infection requiring hospitalisation, parenteral antimicrobial therapy, or as 
otherwise judged clinically significant by the investigator within 6 months prior to Day 1. 
•  Active acute or chronic infection requiring treatment with oral antibiotics, antivirals, 
antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 or superficial skin 
infection within 1 week prior to Day 1.  
•  Known immunodeficiency disorder, including positive serology for HIV at Screening or a first-
degree relative with a hereditary immunodeficiency. 
• 
• 
Infection with HBV or HCV according to protocol-specific testing algorithm. 
Evidence of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) 
infection as evidenced by any of the criteria listed in the Protocol. 
•  Treatments 
Study treatment 
Both ritlecitinib and placebo were provided as tablets for oral administration. The 50 mg and 10 mg 
tablets and their matching placebos were supplied in blister cards such that all participants took the 
same number of tablets per day. 
Compliance 
Compliance was monitored by accounting the unused medication that was returned by the subject at 
the study visits. By compliance <80% or >120%, a participant was counselled by the investigator to 
improve compliance. Non-compliance of the investigational product between visits of <80% or >120% 
was to be reported as a protocol violation (referred to as “protocol deviation” by the applicant). Non-
compliance was dealt with in the analysis as follows: first the primary analyses of the primary and key 
secondary endpoints were conducted according to the intent-to-treat principle, on the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS), which included all participants (regardless of non-compliance issues). The same analyses were 
then repeated on the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), which excluded participants who had major 
protocol deviation related to inclusion/exclusion criteria, compliance regarding investigational product, 
or any other major protocol deviations that, in the opinion of the sponsor study team, might have 
affected the efficacy data through Week 24. Participants were excluded from PPAS if prior to the date 
of the Week 24 visit, subject had a dosing interruption of ≥6 weeks for any reason. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Treatment with the study drug was discontinued in case of adverse effects such as serious infections 
requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy or hospitalisation for treatment, treatment-related SAEs or 
ECG abnormalities. The following laboratory abnormalities (confirmed by retesting) were a reason to 
discontinue the drug:

•  Absolute Neutrophil Count <750/mm3 (<0.75 × 109/L). 
•  Hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL (<5.59 mmol/L or <90 g/L) or a decrease of >30% from baseline 
(either criterion or both). 
Platelet count <75,000/mm3 (<75.0 × 109/L). 
• 
•  Absolute Lymphocyte Count <500/mm3 (<0.5 × 109/L). 
•  Creatine kinase >10 × ULN. 
• 
Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (any of the 
following: >3 times the upper limit of normal with at least one total bilirubin value >2 times 
the upper limit of normal; >3 times the upper limit of normal accompanied by signs or 
symptoms consistent with hepatic injury (eg, new onset elevated PT/INR); two sequential AST 
or ALT elevations >5 times the upper limit of normal, regardless of total bilirubin or 
accompanying signs or symptoms). 
Other reasons for discontinuation were pregnancy, suicidal ideation and non-compliance (under certain 
circumstances).  
Concomitant treatment 
Topical or systemic treatments which could affect AA such as other JAK-inhibitors, 
immunosuppressants including steroids, and phototherapy, were prohibited medications during the 
study. Further, medication with potential drug-drug interactions or potential safety concerns was 
prohibited (e.g. lymphocyte-depleting agents, live attenuated vaccines, moderate to potent CYP3A 
inducers, and specific sensitive to moderate sensitive CYP3A substrates). 
Any other locally approved medication for other indications in an appropriate dose was allowed. 
Subjects were instructed to refrain from starting new or changing doses of permitted drugs (including 
vitamins and dietary supplements) within 7 days or 5 half-lives to Day 1 and prior to study visits 
throughout the study unless it was considered medically essential. 
Rescue medication 
No rescue medication was foreseen in the protocol. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of study B7931015 was to evaluate the efficacy of ritlecitinib compared to 
placebo in adult and adolescent AA participants with 50% or greater scalp hair loss, on regrowth of lost 
hair, measured as SALT Score ≤10 at Week 24. The key secondary objective was to evaluate the 
effect of ritlecitinib on patient-centered outcomes as assessed by PGI-C score of ‘moderately improved’ 
or ‘greatly improved’ at Week 24. Other secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of 
ritlecitinib on regrowth of scalp hair at different time points (using SALT ≤20 at week 24, SALT ≤10 up 
to week 48 and SALT ≤20 up to week 48); to evaluate the efficacy of ritlecitinib on regrowth of 
eyelashes and of eyebrows up to week 48 as measured by ELA and EBA; and to evaluate patient-
reported outcomes as assessed by PGI-C and Alopecia Areata Patient Priority Outcomes (AAPPO) up to 
week 48. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score ≤10 at Week 24.  
The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of participants with a PGI-C score of ‘moderately 
improved’ or ‘greatly improved’ at week 24.  
Other main secondary endpoints were: regrowth of scalp hair using SALT ≤20 at week 24, SALT ≤10 
up to week 48 and SALT ≤20 up to week 48; regrowth of eyelashes and of eyebrows up to week 48 as 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023

measured by at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline or a score of 3 in Eyelash Assessment 
(ELA) and Eyebrow Assessment (EBA); the proportion of participants with PGI-C score of ‘moderately 
improved’ or ‘greatly improved’ up to Week 48 and change in baseline in AAPPO scales up to week 48. 
Description of tools used to measure outcomes  
Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) is a quantitative assessment tool of AA severity based on scalp 
terminal hair loss. The score can vary between 0% (no hair loss) to 100% (100% hair loss) and 
represents an absolute value. Use made of reference values and a mannequin. 
Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) is a patient-reported outcome measure asking the 
subject to evaluate the improvement or worsening of their AA as compared to the start of the study. 
The subject is requested to complete the following sentence ‘Since the start of the study, my alopecia 
areata has: …’ using one of seven responses ranging from ‘greatly improved’ to ‘greatly worsened’. 
PGI-C response was defined as a proportion of patients with PGI-C score of ‘moderately improved’ or 
‘greatly improved’. 
Eyelash Assessment (ELA) is a numeric rating scale (NRS) developed to characterise eyelash hair 
loss; the ELA is rated by the investigator. The numeric rating scale ranges from 0 (none) to 3 (normal) 
as described below. ELA response was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline or a 
score of 3 on the ELA in participants without normal ELA score at baseline. 
Eyebrow Assessment (EBA) is an NRS developed to characterise eyebrow hair loss; the EBA is rated 
by the investigator. The numeric rating scale ranges from 0 (none) to 3 (normal). EBA response was

defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline or a score of 3 on the EBA in participants 
without normal EBA score at baseline.  
Before implementation of the EBA and ELA in study B7981015, the scales were validated by the 
applicant using data from study B7931005 demonstrating the following properties: 
• 
Test-retest reliability: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for EBA and ELA scores 
using screening and baseline data were 0.98 for both scales.  
• 
Convergent validity: At baseline and Week 24, moderate to strong correlations were observed 
between the EBA and ELA scores and scores of the individual item of the Alopecia Areata Symptom 
Impact Scale (AASIS) assessing body or eyelash hair loss (|r| =0.45-0.56) and SALT scores (|r| = 
0.46-0.70).   
• 
Known-groups evidence: Using all available data from baseline to Week 24 it was shown that 
EBA and ELA scores discriminated between levels of SALT scores (all p <0.0001). 
• 
Ability to detect change (responsiveness): Using all available post-baseline data up to Week 
24, the relationship between change in EBA (ELA) scores and change in SALT scores was investigated. 
It was shown that when SALT score is changing, then EBA and ELA scores are also changing. For 
example, a 10% improvement in SALT score is associated with 0.1-point (p-value <0.0001) 
improvement in ELA. Complimentary analysis of correlations between changes in EBA and ELA scores 
and the Investigator Global Assessment were also supportive of the ability of EBA and ELA to detect 
change and were more than 0.4 starting at Week 4 for EBA and at Week 16 for ELA. 
Alopecia Areata Patient Priority Outcomes (AAPPO) scale is a self-administered questionnaire to 
assess hair loss, emotional symptoms, and activity limitations over the past week. The questionnaire is 
described as follows: The first four items of the tool, which cover hair loss from the scalp, eyebrows, 
eyelashes, and body, ask the patient to describe the current amount of hair loss using a 5-point 
response scale that ranges from ‘no hair loss’ to ‘complete (do not have any hair on my [insert body 
area]).’ The remaining items ask the patient to rate the impact of AA over the past week on a 5-point 
scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘always’. 
The development of the AAPPO followed the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA. Draft Guidance: Patient-focused drug development: methods to identify what is important to 
patients guidance for industry, food and drug administration staff, and other stakeholders; 2019). 
Specifically, concepts were initially identified from a targeted literature review, an instrument review, 
and an FDA Patient-Focused Drug Development public meeting about AA. Subsequently, the identified 
concepts were tested in concept elicitation interviews in adults with AA, after which a final 11-item

instrument was created that demonstrated content validity in the target population of adults and 
adolescents with AA (Winnette et al., 2021). RTI-HS and the applicant conducted a validation study to 
assess the additional measurement properties of the AAPPO (Wyrwich et al., 2021). Results 
demonstrated moderate to strong correlations of the high-level terms (HL) items with the Alopecia 
Areata Symptoms and Impacts (AASIS) and the Patient's Global Impression of Severity.  
•  Sample size 
The sample size of 120 per treatment arm (and 120 in the two placebo arms combined) provides more 
than 90% power for the SALT ≤10 at Week 24 endpoint, assuming that the 200 mg/50 mg QD group is 
superior to placebo by a difference of 20% in the proportion of subjects achieving SALT ≤10 and 
assuming a placebo response rate of no more than 5% at the more stringent significance level of 1% 
requested by the CHMP. The planned sample size of 120 subjects per group also provides more than 
90% power for PGI-C response, assuming a difference of 35% and a placebo response rate of 20%, at 
a two-sided significance level of 1% requested by the CHMP. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were allocated to treatment groups using an interactive response technology (IRT) system. 
Randomisation was stratified on age (<18 years and ≥ 18 years) and AT/AU versus not AT/AU used for 
operational purposes to achieve a global target composition for AT/AU and adolescent subjects in the 
enrolled population.  
Subjects were randomised in a 2:2:2:2:1:1:1 manner to blinded 200 mg/50 mg once daily (QD), 200 
mg/30 mg QD, 50 mg/50 mg QD, 30 mg/30 mg QD, 10 mg/10 mg QD, placebo loading and 
maintenance followed by 200 mg/50 mg QD during extension and placebo loading and maintenance 
followed by 50 mg/50 mg QD during extension.  
Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team were blinded to treatment throughout the study. A 
blinded screening independent photo review (IPR) of participant scalp photos was used to verify 
eligibility (eg, ≥50% hair loss of the scalp, hair loss due to AA). Once the photos had been uploaded 
into the Canfield Data Management System (DMS), the Canfield Clinical Services Project Management 
Team (CSPMT) reviewed the photos for quality. The Canfield CSPMT was not blinded in terms of site 
ID, participant ID, and visit but were blinded to study intervention assignment. Once the screening 
photos were approved by the Canfield CSPMT, the IPR procedures described in the response were 
followed. All photos were reviewed by the Canfield CSPMT for quality; however, an IPR was never 
utilised to confirm site SALT scores at any post-screening visit. The IPRs were blinded with respect to 
subject identifiers (save for sequence numbering) and investigator information. Although the IPR may 
have calculated a SALT score to determine eligibility unless the IPR noted the SALT score in the 
optional comments, the SALT score was neither communicated back to the site nor was it stored in the 
Canfield system.  
Blinded ritlecitinib and matching placebo were provided as tablets for oral administration. The tablets 
and their matching placebos were supplied in blister cards labelled according to local regulatory 
requirements. All participants took 7 tablets/day during the Loading Period, 4 tablets/day during the 
Maintenance Period, 7 tablets/day during the first 4 weeks of the Extension period, and 4 tablets/day 
for the remainder of the Extension Period. 
•  Statistical methods 
Statistical methods were detailed in Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) version 5.0 dated 09 July 2021. 
Version history listed changes to the SAP related to the specification of the primary and key secondary 
endpoint (based on FDA and EMA recommendations), update of power analyses, the definition of per 
protocol analysis set, the addition of stratified randomisation procedure used and introduction of 
Assessment report

testing procedures to account for multiple testing and use of more stringent significance level for 
regulatory submission. In addition, it was added that the study may be unblinded for internal decision-
making purposes. 
Analysis populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all subjects who have been randomised, regardless of whether 
they received study medication. Subjects were analysed in the treatment groups as they were 
randomised. If a subject was randomised but received the incorrect treatment, then the subject was 
reported under their randomised treatment group for all efficacy analyses. If a subject was treated but 
not randomised, then the subject was excluded from the FAS. Comparisons of SALT scores and PGI-C 
were done in the FAS. In addition, a Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), a Safety Analysis Set (SAS) and 
PK Analysis Set were defined (Table 11). Data from the two treatment arms that start with the 24-
week placebo period were pooled in the analyses for endpoints defined up to week 24. 
Table 11: Overview and definition of analysis sets 
For the primary endpoint of SALT ≤ 10 response at week 24, a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) 
for longitudinal binary data of response based on SALT ≤ 10 over time up to Week 24 was used. Fixed 
factors in this model are treatment (6 levels), visit (5 levels) and treatment-by-visit interaction. Visit is 
included as a categorical covariate, and a subject-specific random intercept was used. The key 
secondary endpoint of PGI-C response at week 24 was analysed similarly to the primary endpoint.  
The evaluation of the effect of loading versus no loading dose on the response at Week 24 was 
assessed by logistic regression applied to the data from the 30 mg and 50 mg maintenance doses, with 
and without the loading dose. In addition, the interaction between the two effects (loading y/n and 
maintenance dose) was tested.  
For continuous secondary endpoints up to Week 24, a mixed-effect model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) was used. The MMRM method was also applied to the continuous data up to Week 48 (over 
the entire study) for initial active treatment groups. LSM, standard error and 95% CI were presented 
for each treatment group without treatment comparison. 
Multiple testing strategies for the primary and key secondary endpoint 
The SALT ≤10 response at Week 24 was the primary endpoint and the PGI-C response at Week 24 was 
analysed as a key secondary endpoint. There were a total of 8 hypotheses (primary endpoint and key 
secondary endpoint in combination with 4 dosing schemes) that was tested as part of a hierarchical 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 95/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
testing strategy. The family-wise type I error was strongly controlled over the hypotheses at a two-
sided 1% significance level using a gate-keeping approach as shown in the following Figure 12: 
Figure 12: Overview of the hierarchical testing procedure used for primary and key secondary 
endpoints 
Hypothesis H1 is tested first at a significance level of α = 0.01. The Familywise error rate is controlled 
over the eight hypotheses for primary and key secondary endpoint at the (two-sided) 1% significance 
level. 
For some secondary endpoints (SALT ≤ 20 at week 48 and SALT ≤10 at weeks 18, 12, 8, and 4), 
additional multiple testing strategies were specified outside of the gate-keeping strategy for primary 
and key secondary endpoint.   
Missing data and estimands 
Primary and supplementary analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints are given in Table 
12. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint (SALT ≤ 10) and key secondary endpoint (PGI-C) is 
based on a MAR assumption and uses multiple imputation methods for missing SALT scores due to 
COVID-19. A composite estimand strategy is used for SALT scores missing due to other reasons, in 
which case subjects are considered non-responders (Analysis 4). Three supplementary analyses are 
performed for the primary endpoint using the Miettinen and Nurminen (MN) method and considering 
different strategies for handling missing data due to COVID-19.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 1097 participants were screened. The most frequent reasons for screen failures are 
presented in Table 13. Subsequently, 718 participants were randomised to treatment (Figure 13).  
Table 13: The most frequent reasons for screen failures 
Of these randomised participants, 715 (99.6%) received treatment and 101 (14%) discontinued 
treatment. The proportions of participants discontinuing during the Placebo-Controlled Period (week 0-
24) were similar across treatment groups with 5-8%, except for the 30 mg group in which 11% of 
patients discontinued. During the Extension Period (weeks 25-48), discontinuation ranged from 3.8% 
(50 mg) to 8.5% (200/30 mg). Overall, 614 (86%) of participants completed treatment. 
The reasons for discontinuation were adverse effects, lack of efficacy, the physician’s decision to 
withdraw. These numbers were not different between treatment groups. There were 2 cases of 
protocol deviation and 2 cases of pregnancy.

Figure 13: Participant flow in study B7981015 
Protocol deviations are presented in Table 14 and Table 15. A total of 96% of participants had at least 
one protocol deviation and 68% had at least one important protocol deviation. There was roughly 
comparable distributions of protocol deviations and important protocol deviations among study arms. 
The most prominent sources of protocol deviations pertain to the following categories: 
procedures/tests (76% in total), laboratory (72% in total), investigational product (52% in total),  and 
visit schedule (42.5% in total). The most prominent sources of important protocol deviations pertain to 
the following categories: investigational product (43%), procedures/tests (31%), laboratory (16%).

Table 15: Summary of all important protocol deviations in Study B7981015
A total of 20 participants had compliance <80% between Day 1 through Week 24, and the numbers 
were similar between the groups. Of these 20 participants, 15 were excluded from the PPAS (13 due to 
non-compliance and 2 due to missing SALT score at Week 24), and 5 were not excluded from the PPAS 
(although these participants had a documented potentially important protocol deviation of weekly non-
compliance <80%, they did not meet the criterion of a dosing interruption of ≥6 weeks prior to the 
Week 24 visit). 
•  Recruitment 
The recruitment started 3 December 2018, and the data collection ended June 24, 2021. The study 
included participants from 118 sites in 18 countries (Australia, Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, 
Colombia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russian 
Federation, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom and the United States). 
•  Conduct of the study 
The study was performed in accordance with ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki, 
in compliance with all ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and with applicable laws and country-
specific regulations in which the studies were conducted. Protocol amendments were made at five 
different time points, the most relevant concerned adjustments in the secondary endpoint and 
adjustments in the analysis to account for missing data due to COVID-19. The PGI-C became a key 
secondary endpoint. Both amendments were implemented after this was recommended during the 
Scientific advice.    
•  Baseline data 
In total, 718 patients were included in the pivotal trial (Table 16). The majority (85%) of the 
participants were adults (≥18 years of age), and 15% were adolescents. The mean age of the 
participants was 34 years. The study included 105 adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) who all were 
recruited outside of the EU. There was a limited proportion (<5%) of elderly (>65 years of age) 
participants in the study. There were more female (62%) than male (38%) participants. Most (60-
70%) participants were Caucasian. Age, gender, and race were evenly distributed over treatment 
groups. 
The disease characteristics such as the median duration since AA diagnosis (6.9 years), a median 
duration of the current episode (2.5 years), the proportion of AT/AU participants (46%) and the mean 
SALT score (88-93) were also similar across the groups.  
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 99/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Over treatment groups, on average 69% (60-77%) of participants had received prior pharmacologic 
treatment for AA. The most frequent prior pharmacological treatment for AA were: topical 
corticosteroids (38%); oral/IV/IM steroids (29%); intralesional corticosteroid injection (28%); and 
topical vasodilator (24%). On average, 25% of participants had received prior non-drug 
treatments/procedures for AA. About 30% of participants across treatment groups received prior 
treatments not considered a prior pharmacological treatment for AA; these numbers were similar 
between the groups. 
Concomitant medication for conditions other than AA was taken by about 80% of the participants during 
the  double-blind  period  in  the  main  study,  without  differences  between  the  placebo  and  ritlecitinib 
groups. A maximum of 1 participant in each group reported using AA medication.  
Table 16: Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics (study B7981015) 
•  Numbers analysed 
Data from the intention to treat (ITT) population constituted the full analysis set and included all 
randomised participants. Out of the randomised 718 participants, 715 were treated. The groups 
consisted of n=132 (ritlecitinib 200/50 mg), n=130 (ritlecitinib 200/30 mg), n=130 (ritlecitinib 50 
mg), n=132 ritlecitinib 30 mg), n=63 (ritlecitinib 10mg), n=131 (placebo). The placebo group was 
divided in the Extension phase into 2 groups: n=65 (ritlecitinib 200/50 mg) and n=66 (ritlecitinib 50 
mg). 
Per protocol population (defined as all randomised subjects who do not have any major protocol 
deviation) consisted of n=115 (ritlecitinib 200/50 mg), n=116 (ritlecitinib 200/30 mg), n=120 
(ritlecitinib 50 mg), n=126 ritlecitinib 30 mg), n=55 (ritlecitinib 10mg), n=124 (placebo). The placebo 
group was divided in the Extension phase into 2 groups: n=60 (ritlecitinib 200/50 mg) and n=64 
(ritlecitinib 50 mg).

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was met. The responses in SALT≤10 in the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg (21%), 200/30 
mg (13%), 50 mg (13%) and 30 mg (11%) groups were larger than placebo (1.5%) at week 24, at a 
significance level of p< 0.005 (Table 17). The mean difference (95%CI) with placebo was 20% (12-28) 
for the 200/50 mg group, 11% (5-18) for the 200/30 mg group, 12% (5-18) for the 50 mg group, and 
9% (3-15) for the 30 mg group. The effect in the ritlecitinib 10 mg group did not differ from the effect 
in the placebo group; the 10 mg group was a priori not included in the estimations for the primary 
endpoint. 
Table 17: Response based on SALT≤10 at Week 24
Key secondary endpoint 
The key secondary endpoint was met. The response in PGI-C in the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg (52%), 
200/30 mg (45%), 50 mg (49%) and 30 mg (42%) groups was larger than in placebo (9%) at week 
24, at a significance level of p< 0.005 (Table 18). The mean difference (95%CI) with placebo was 43% 
(32-54) for the 200/50 mg group, 36% (25-47) for the 200/30 mg group, 40% (29-51) for the 50 mg 
group, 33% (22-43) for the 30 mg group. The effect in the ritlecitinib 10 mg group did not differ from 
that in the placebo group.

Other secondary endpoints 
Also, for SALT ≤20 response at week 24, ritlecitinib 200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg and 30 mg were 
significantly different from placebo (p< 0.01). Compared to placebo, the ritlecitinib 10 mg group was 
not included in the Type I error-controlled testing procedure for efficacy. 
The response rates for SALT ≤20 were higher than those using the SALT ≤10 given that SALT ≤20 is 
a less stringent measure of hair regrowth (Table 19).

Table 19: Response based on SALT≤20 at Week 24 
The proportion of participants with SALT ≤20 further increased after week 24 (Figure 14). The 
response became statistically different from placebo at Week 8 (for the ritlecitinib 200/50mg group), 
Week 12 (200/30 mg group), and Week 18 (50 mg and 30 mg groups). 
At Week 24, the proportion of participants with SALT ≤20 was larger in participants who had received 
a 200 mg loading dose for 4 weeks than in participants treated for 24 weeks without a loading dose: 
200/50 mg (31%) versus 50 mg (23%); 200/30 mg (22%) versus 30 mg (14%). By Week 48, the 
proportion of participants with SALT ≤20 was similar between the participants who had received a 200 
mg loading dose for 4 weeks and those who were treated for 48 weeks without a loading dose: 200/50 
mg (40%) versus 50 mg (43%); 200/30 mg (34%) versus 30 mg (31%).  
Those participants who, by design, switched from placebo to ritlecitinib after Week 24 showed an 
average response at week 48 which was similar to that of participants at Week 24 treated with the 
same regimen from the start (placebo->200/50 mg [35%] and placebo -> 50 mg [19%] vs. 200/50 
mg [31%] and 50 mg [23%]).

Figure 14: Response based on SALT≤20 up to Week 48 
After week 24 the proportion of participants with SALT ≤10 increased (Figure 15). The absolute 
responses were lower for SALT ≤10 than SALT ≤20. The response became statistically different from 
placebo at Week 18 for the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg group, other groups (ritlecitinib 200/30 mg, 50 mg, 
and 30 mg) became significantly different from placebo at Week 24. 
Similarly to the response SALT≤20, at Week 24, the proportion of participants with SALT ≤10 was 
greater in participants who had received a 200 mg loading dose for 4 weeks than in participants 
treated for 24 weeks without a loading dose: 200/50 mg (22%) versus 50 mg (14%). By Week 48, the 
proportion of participants with SALT ≤10 was similar between the participants who received a 200 mg 
loading dose for 4 weeks and those who were treated for 48 weeks without a loading dose: 200/50 mg 
(33%) versus 50 mg (31%); 200/30 mg (28%) versus 30 mg (25%). 
Those participants who switched from placebo to ritlecitinib after Week 24 demonstrated a response 
at Week 48 which was similar to that of participants at Week 24 treated with the same regimen from 
start (placebo->200/50 mg [25%] and placebo -> 50 mg [14%] vs. 200/50 mg [25%] and 50 mg 
[14%]).

The proportion of participants with EBA response increased from week 4 to week 24 in ritlecitinib 
200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg, and 30 mg and continued to increase after Week 24 (Figure 16). At 24 
weeks the proportion of participants with EBA response was significantly higher in ritlecitinib 200/50 
mg (34%), 200/30 mg (25%), 50 mg (29%) and 30 mg (17%) groups than in the placebo group 
(4.7%).  
By Week 48, the proportion of participants with EBA response was similar between the participants 
who received a 200 mg loading dose for 4 weeks and those who were treated for 48 weeks without a 
loading dose: 200/50 mg (43%) versus 50 mg (44%); 200/30 mg (33%) versus 30 mg (33%). In 
participants who had received placebo during the first 24 weeks, after transitioning to active treatment 
(placebo->200/50 mg; placebo->50 mg), the proportion of participants with EBA response increased 
from Week 28 to Week 48. At Week 48, the proportion of participants with EBA response in 
participants first treated with placebo was similar to that of participants at Week 24 treated with the 
same regimen (placebo->200/50 mg [31%] and placebo->50 mg [31%] vs. (200/50 mg [34%] and 
50 mg [29%]).

score up to Week 48 
The proportion of participants with ELA response increased from Week 4 to Week 24 in ritlecitinib 
200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg, and 30 mg and continued to increase after Week 24. At Week 24, the 
proportion of participants with ELA response was larger in 200/50 mg (30%), 200/30 mg (21%), 50 
mg (29%), and 30 mg (26%) than 10 mg (4.9%) or placebo (5%). The proportion of participants in 
the first 4 groups was also significantly higher than in the placebo group. At both Week 24 and Week 
48, the proportion of participants with ELA response was similar with and without a loading dose for 4 
weeks (Week 24: 200/50 mg (30%) versus 50 mg (29%); 200/30 mg (21%) versus 30 mg (26%); 
Week 48: 200/50 mg (38%) versus 50 mg (40%); 200/30 mg (30%) versus 30 mg (31%). Similarly 
to other endpoints, transitioning from placebo to active treatment after 24 weeks increased the 
response by Week 48.  
The proportion of PGI-C responders increased from Week 4 to Week 24 in ritlecitinib 200/50 mg, 
200/30 mg, 50 mg, and 30 mg (Figure 17). This increase continued to a lesser degree up to week 48. 
The proportion of PGI-C responders in ritlecitinib 200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg, and 30 mg was 
larger than in placebo starting at Week 4. In participants who had received placebo during the first 24 
weeks, after transitioning to active treatment, the proportion of PGI-C responders increased from 
Week 24 to Week 48. At Week 48, the proportion of PGI-C responders in groups first treated with 
placebo was generally consistent with that of participants at Week 24 treated with the same regimen.

Figure 17: PGI-C response to Week 48 
Patient-reported impression of improvement (defined as achieving a score of 0 [no hair loss] or 1 [little 
hair loss]) on each of AAPPO hair loss items 1-4 (scalp, eyebrows, eyelash, body hair) was assessed 
in participants with a baseline score of 2-4 (indicating moderate-complete hair loss). Up to week 24, 
the proportion of participants reporting an improvement on AAPPO hair loss items 1-4 increased in 
ritlecitinib 200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg, and 30 mg groups; the increase was greater than in 10 mg 
and placebo. In participants who had received placebo, after transitioning to active treatment, the 
proportion of participants with improvement on AAPPO items 1-4 increased from week 24 to week 48. 
At week 48 the proportion of participants who were first treated with placebo until Week 24 was similar 
to that of participants at week 24 treated with the same regimen. In the AAPPO, the Emotional 
Symptoms domain score is defined as mean of items 5-8, and the Activity Limitations subscore is 
defined as the mean of items 9-11. Up to Week 24, the least square mean change from baseline 
indicated mean Emotional Symptoms scores improved modestly in all groups, including placebo. There 
was no difference between any active treatment group and placebo.  
•  Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses have been performed using the SALT10 and the PGI-C at week 24 (primary and 
key secondary outcomes).  
Subgroup data with respect to SALT ≤10 score for ritlecitinib 50mg, the dose proposed by the 
applicant, are visualised in a forest plot (Figure 18). Treatment with ritlecitinib 50 mg resulted in a 
higher proportion of SALT ≤10 responders than placebo in most subgroups. The differences in 
proportions of SALT ≤10 responders at Week 24 between ritlecitinib and placebo were similar in 
adolescents and adults. Some subgroups were small, such as patients >65 years of age, which is 
reflected in large standard errors. Placebo-adjusted SALT ≤10 responses at week 24 were similar for 
White and Asian participants; the numbers of participants of other races were low. The difference in 
SALT ≤10 response of ritlecitinib versus placebo was lower in participants with AT/AU than in those 
without AT/AU at Week 24.

Figure 18: Response based on SALT ≤10 at Week 24 with ritlecitinib 50mg by subgroups 
Subgroup data with respect to PGI-C response for 50mg, the dose proposed by the applicant, were 
visualised in a forest plot. Treatment with ritlecitinib 50 mg resulted in a higher proportion of PGI-C 
improvement than placebo in most subgroups. The subgroup of elderly participants (above 65 years of 
age) was small. The differences in proportions of participants with PGI-C improvement was similar 
between AT/AU and non-AT/AU participants. 
Adolescents 
There were no separate studies conducted in adolescents. Adolescent data was incorporated into study 
B7981015 (efficacy and safety) and B7981032 (safety). The applicant conducted extrapolation 
analyses to investigate the generalisation of data from the non-EU adolescents to the EU adolescent 
population. These analyses compared age groups (adults and adolescents) and regions (EU vs non-
EU). Data derived from adolescent (non-EU only) and adult (non-EU and EU) AA participants in study 
B7981015 indicate that the efficacy of ritlecitinib, as measured by improvements in scalp hair loss 
(SALT score) and patient-reported treatment benefits (PGI-C and AAPPO), in non-EU adults is similar 
to that of EU adults, and ritlecitinib efficacy in non-EU adolescents is consistent with that in non-EU 
adults. Figure 19 shows that there was a similar SALT≤10 response (primary outcome) for ritlecitinib 
50 mg between EU/non-EU adults and non-EU adolescents with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. 
Similar results are shown for SALT≤20 and PGI-C responses at week 24. The dose-response 
relationship is similar for SALT≤10  in adolescents and adults at week 24.

Results and Analysis 
Results of treatment comparison between the ritlecitinib 10 mg dose group and the placebo group are not presented. The 10 mg 
group was included in the study only to support the characterisation of the exposure response; it was not planned for comparison 
versus placebo, as it was not expected to have meaningful efficacy.

Notes 
In this analysis, a generalised linear mixed effect model without imputation using observed data up to 
Week 24 was used as the imputation model. Estimation of model parameters was performed assuming 
MAR using Bayesian framework with non-informative/weakly informative prior densities and MCMC. For a 
participant with missing response at Week 24 due to COVID-19, imputation was done based on predictive 
Bernoulli distribution with a probability equal to the probability under MAR calculated using the sampled 
parameters. 
Participants with missing SALT score at Week 24 due to reasons other than COVID-19 were considered non-
responders. A single complete imputed data set for Week 24 was analysed using the Miettinen and 
Nurminen method as the analysis model.

2.6.5.3.  Supportive studies 
Three studies (B7931005, B7981037 and B7981032) provide additional information about efficacy 
over time and for the duration of treatment with ritlecitinib.  
Two studies (B7981048 and B7981072) provide information about AA patient preferences for 
treatment attributes. Study 048 was performed in adults; patient preferences were elicited using a 
discrete choice experiment and applied to the trial results in AA in a quantitative Benefit/Risk analysis. 
Study 072 was a similar discrete choice experiment performed in adolescents.   
Study B7931005 
The placebo-controlled part of study B7931005 (Week 1-24) is described in the section Proof of 
Concept Study above. The single-blinded period of this study evaluated the course of hair loss 
following week 24 and could provide information on the duration of treatment with ritlecitinib.  
As described above, after the 4-week drug holiday (starting immediately after Week 24) responders 
(those having achieved at least a 30% improvement in the SALT score from Baseline at Week 24) were 
treated with placebo and monitored every 2 weeks. In case of hair loss of more than 30% with respect 
to week 24 (i.e. change in SALT >30%) participants were started on ritlecitinib (4 weeks 200 mg QD 
and 20 weeks of ritlecitinib 50mg QD). The non-responders (from either the placebo or ritlecitinib 
group from Week 1-24) were treated with ritlecitinib throughout the entire single blinded period. The 
non-responders group included 33 participants, respectively 17 and 16 from the placebo and ritlecitinib 
group from Week 1-24. 
A total of 22 participants who met the responder criteria entered the withdrawal/retreatment period. Of 
the 22 ritlecitinib responders, 15 participants met the retreatment criterion, 3 discontinued before 
meeting the retreatment criterion, and 4 completed the withdrawal segment without meeting the 
retreatment criterion. One of the 15 participants who met the criterion for retreatment voluntarily 
withdrew from the study upon meeting the retreatment criterion. 
The minimum time to meet the retreatment criterion was 4.3 weeks; the median time to meet the 
retreatment criterion was 16.1 weeks, including the 4-week drug holiday. Among the participants who 
met the retreatment criterion, 7/14 (50%) had at least a 30% improvement in SALT score at 
treatment re-initiation compared to the study baseline. At the end of the retreatment period (after  
24 weeks of retreatment), 8/14 participants (57%) had at least a 30% improvement in SALT score 
compared to study Baseline. Of 6 remaining participants, 5 did not have SALT data available at the end 
of the retreatment period.

The effect of ritlecitinib treatment in non-responders in the single blinded period was compared to 
placebo group of the Initial 24-Week Treatment Period. The non-responders who were treated with 
ritlecitinib in both the Initial phase and in the single blinded phase (“active non-responders”) showed 
only a slight improvement in SALT score compared to the placebo group from the Initial phase. 
Participants treated with the placebo in the first 24 weeks and with ritlecitinib during the single blinded 
phase (“placebo non-responders”)” demonstrated an improvement in SALT score similar to the 
ritlecitinib group in the Initial 24-Week Treatment Period (LSM difference from placebo 29%; 90% CI 
[20%, 38%] at p-value <0.0001). 
B7981037 
Study B7981037 is phase 2a, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled safety study 
designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ritlecitinib (for more information, see Safety 
section). However, two secondary efficacy endpoints were included: change from baseline in SALT 
score over time and of PGI-C score response (‘greatly improved’ or ‘moderately improved’) over time. 
The Placebo-Controlled Treatment Phase, which included 2 groups (ritlecitinib and placebo) lasted for 9 
months. The dose of ritlecitinib consisted of 4 weeks of loading dose 200 mg QD and 8 months of 
ritlecitinib 50mg QD. There were 36 participants in the ritlecitinib and 35 participants in the placebo 
group. The inclusion criterion with respect to the extent of AA was ≥25% hair loss. This was different 
than in Study 005 and 015. 
At Months 3, 6, and 9, the decrease in LSM change from baseline in SALT scores was larger in the 
ritlecitinib group than in placebo (-23 vs. -2.7, -35 vs. -5.1, and -38 vs. -6.8 , respectively), see Figure 
20. The 95% CI for the difference between groups excluded 0 at all timepoints. The findings were 
similar for the PGI-C outcome: a larger proportion of participants in the ritlecitinib group mg were PGI-
C responders (defined as 'greatly improved' or 'moderately improved') compared to placebo at Months 
3, 6, and 9 (56%, 58%, and 53%, respectively). The 95% CI for the difference between groups 
excluded 0 at all timepoints.

B7981032 
Study B7981032 is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, multi-centre, long-term study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of ritlecitinib in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age with AA. The study 
Assessment report

included a 36-month open-label treatment period. This study included rollover participants from 
B7931005 and B7981015 who received open-label 50 mg ritlecitinib QD for 36 months, and de novo 
participants who received open-label 200 mg loading dose for 4 weeks, followed by the open-label 50 
mg ritlecitinib QD dose for 35 months. An additional treatment period (of variable length for individual 
participants) was later added in Protocol Amendment 6 to allow participants not requiring 
discontinuation per protocol to continue to receive study intervention for a maximum of an additional 
24 months or until the availability of the commercial product in their country, or until the Sponsor 
terminates the study in that country, whichever occurs first. The total treatment duration of study 
B7981032 will therefore be 60 months. A Primary Completion Date (PCD) Clinical Study Report (CSR) 
with data through Month 36 is expected to be finalised in November 2024. A Supplemental CSR with 
final study data through the last visit of the last participant in the study, including available data up to 
Month 60, is expected to be final by May 2026. The final CSR will be submitted post approval once 
available. 
The original submission was based on the data cut-off date of 28 February 2022. Efficacy data has 
been updated based on a cut-off date of 07 November 2022. 
Although the primary endpoints were focused on safety, secondary efficacy outcomes were included: 
SALT score ≤10 and ≤ 20 through Month 36, response based on achieving at least a 2-grade 
improvement from Baseline or a score of 3 in EBA or ELA score through Month 36; and PGI-C response 
defined as PGI-C score of ‘moderately improved’ or ‘greatly improved’ through Month 36. 
This study included rollover participants from studies B7931005 and B7981015 who received open-
label 50 mg ritlecitinib QD for 36 months, and de novo participants who received open-label 200 mg 
loading dose for 4 weeks, followed by the open-label 50 mg ritlecitinib QD dose for 35 months.  
Unlike in studies B7981015 and B7931005 where the inclusion criterion was ≥50% terminal scalp hair 
loss, the inclusion criterion for the de novo participants was ≥25% terminal scalp hair loss due to AA. 
Efficacy analyses were descriptive in nature; there was no formal hypothesis testing, though 95% two-
sided confidence intervals were reported. Missing data were not imputed. The results through Month 
30-32 are presented. Data are not presented after Month 30-32 as there were only a limited number of 
participants with efficacy data beyond that timepoint as of the 07 November 2022 data cut.  
Data from studies B7981015 and B7981032 were combined to form the All Exposure Cohort (AEC) 
which are presented below. 
SALT ≤10 response rate continued to increase through Month 24 and then remained generally stable 
through Month 30-32 for both the 200/50 mg Combined and the 50 mg Combined groups. For the 
200/50 mg Combined group, 58% of participants at Month 24 and 55% at Month 30-32 had SALT ≤10 
response. For the 50 mg Combined group, 51% of participants at Month 24 and 54% at Month 30-32 
had SALT ≤10 response (Figure 21).

PGI-C response (defined as a PGI-C score of ‘moderately improved’ or ‘greatly improved’) was 
maintained from Month 12 to Month 30-32 for the 200/50 mg Combined group and from Month 18 to 
Month 30-32 for the 50 Combined group. For the 200/50 mg Combined group, 78% of participants at 
Month 24 and 79 % at Month 30-32 had PGI-C response. For the 50 mg Combined group, 70 % of 
participants at both Month 24 and Month 30-32 had PGI-C response (Figure 22).

Similar patterns were seen for the SALT ≤20 and EBA/ELA response through Month 30-32 for both the 
200/50 mg Combined and 50 mg Combined groups in the AEC. 
Regarding the subgroup of adolescents, 42 adolescent participants were withdrawn for the reason of 
‘no longer meets eligibility criteria’. The majority were withdrawn because they did not meet the study 
continuation criteria for adolescents, which were added in study B7981032 Protocol Amendment 4 
following FDA's advice to amend the protocol to limit exposure to the drug product in adolescent 
participants if limited treatment effects were observed. To assess the potential impact of these early 
withdrawals, additional analyses using non-responder imputation (NRI) and last observation carried

forward (LOCF) methods were also performed for SALT response rates and CFB in SALT scores, 
respectively.   
In both adults and adolescents in the All Exposure Cohort SALT≤ 10 responders increased and SALT 
change from baseline decreased up to Month 24 in both adults and adolescents indicating regrowth of 
the lost hair. NRI and LOCF analysis showed similar trends, and the results were further supported by 
SALT ≤ 20 and PGI-C responses.  
With respect to AT/AU vs non-AT/AU groups, SALT ≤10 response rates generally increased over 
time in AT/AU and non-AT/AU for the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg Combined group and the 50 mg Combined 
group. For the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg Combined group, the non-AT/AU subgroup had higher SALT ≤10 
response rates than the AT/AU subgroup through Month 30-32 with nonoverlapping 95% CIs for all 
timepoints. For the ritlecitinib 50 mg Combined group, SALT ≤10 response rates tended to be higher 
for participants with non-AT/AU than for those with AT/AU through Month 18. At the Month 21 through 
Month 30-32 visits, response rates were similar for participants with and without AT/AU for ritlecitinib 
50 mg. Similar observations were made for SALT ≤20 response over time for the AT/AU and non-
AT/AU subgroups. 
The change from baseline in SALT scores for the 200/50 mg Combined group for the non-AT/AU 
subgroup had greater reduction from baseline than the AT/AU subgroup through Month 30-32, with 
non-overlapping 95% CIs at all timepoints except Month 27/28 and Month 30-32 (Figure 23). The 
change in baseline in SALT score over time for the ritlecitinib 50 mg Combined group was similar for 
the AT/AU and non-AT/AU subgroups through Month 21, with continued decreases (i.e., improvement) 
through Month 30-32 for the AT/AU subgroup. 
Figure 23: Change from baseline in SALT score over time by AA severity (observed data) 
NRI and LOCF analysis for AT/AU and non-AT/AU subgroups showed similar trends as the observed 
data. 
In order to identify an appropriate time to consider discontinuation of ritlecitinib in AA patients who 
are non-responders, additional analysis was conducted in patients who rolled over from study 
B7981015 to study B7981032. Three periods of possible response were identified: early (up to week 
24), middle (week 24-48) and late (after week 48). SALT response trajectories were constructed for 
Late Responders to identify those participants who achieved SALT≤20 response after week 48.

An additional predictive analysis of SALT response at Month 18 based on earlier SALT scores was 
carried out in ritlecitinib-treated participants. In this analysis, ‘no response’ was defined as the failure 
to reach a reduction of at least 30% from baseline on SALT scores (SALT30) during the 18-month 
period of treatment with ritlecitinib.  
To evaluate a potential stopping rule for the non-responder group, 2 parameters were tested to predict 
the lack of response up to Month 18: i) magnitude of SALT improvement (10%, 20%, 25%, and 30% 
improvement from baseline), and ii) time points (namely Months 6, 9, and 12). Predictors were 
evaluated by how well they could identify potential non
responders. 
The highest probability of being a non-responder (failure to reach a reduction of at least 30% from 
‑
baseline on SALT scores) at Month 18 based on percent change from baseline at an earlier visit 
(negative predictive value) was 77% and 75% at Month 9 and 77% and 73% at Month 12, based on 
SALT improvement of 10% and 20% respectively. 
Finally, Group Based Trajectories Modeling was employed to visualise trajectories which can be used to 
identify subsets of participants in the Ritlecitinib 50 mg Combined Group who followed similar 
longitudinal patterns of response based on SALT scores at Months 1, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 (Figure 24).

B7981048: Alopecia Areata Benefit-risk trade-off study in adults  
The main objectives of this study were to: elicit patient preferences for AA treatment attributes and 
to estimate maximum acceptable risks (MARs) of potential safety concerns associated with JAK 
inhibitors that AA patients are willing to tolerate for specific treatment benefits, and to assess the net 
benefit-risk profile of oral ritlecitinib 50 mg QD compared to 30 mg QD and to placebo. 
The design of the study was a cross-sectional quantitative survey administered online to patients in 
the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Patient preferences 
were elicited using a discrete-choice experiment in which patients were asked to choose between two 
hypothetical AA treatment profiles and no treatment in a series of questions. Each hypothetical 
treatment profile was defined by six attributes: the probability of 80% to 100% scalp hair regrowth 
over 24 weeks of treatment, the probability of moderate or normal eyebrows after 24 weeks of 
Assessment report

treatment, probability of moderate or normal eyelashes after 24 weeks of treatment, 3-year risk of 
serious infection due to treatment, 3-year risk of cancer (including non-melanoma skin cancer) due to 
treatment, and 3-year risk of blood clot due to treatment. The profiles and profile pairs in the series of 
questions were determined using an experimental design. Preferences were then combined with clinical 
data for ritlecitinib 50 mg QD, ritlecitinib 30 mg QD, and placebo from clinical studies in a quantitative 
benefit-risk assessment model. 
The sample consisted of 201 adult patients (age 18 years and older) with a dermatologist-confirmed 
diagnosis of AA recruited from the US (n=62), UK (n=22), France (n=3), Germany (n=30), Italy 
(n=59), and Spain (n=25). The mean (SD) age of patients in the sample was 41 (14) years and 130 
(65%) were female. Most patients had been diagnosed with AA at least two years ago (80%) and were 
not currently on treatment (52%). The most common area of hair loss was on the scalp (95% of 
patients) followed by eyebrows (67% of patients) and eyelashes (60% of patients). Very few patients 
had prior serious infection (10%), cancer (2%), or blood clot (4%). 
Relative attribute importance (RAI) values showed that the most important attribute for AA 
patients was the benefit of increasing the chance (from 0% to 50%) of getting back most or all of the 
hair on the scalp after 24 weeks of treatment (RAI 42%); (Figure 25). This was followed by a reduction 
in the risk of serious infection from 6% to 0.1% during three years of treatment (RAI 13%), a 
decrease in the risk of getting cancer from 2% to 0.1% during three years of treatment (RAI 13%), 
and the benefits of increasing the chance of getting moderate or normal eyebrows from 0% to 40% 
after 24 weeks (RAI: 12%). The reduction from 6% to 0.1% in the risk of getting blood clots during 
three years of treatment (RAI 11%), and benefits of increasing the chance from 0 % to 40% of getting 
moderate or normal eyelashes after 24 weeks (RAI 9.2%) were less important. Overall, patients placed 
more value on benefits, with a sum (95%CI) of benefit attribute RAIs of 63% (59% - 67%) than the 
treatment risks, with a sum (95%CI) of risk attribute RAIs of 37% (33% - 41%).

experiment 
The percentage-point increase in each 3-year risk that respondents were willing to accept in exchange 
for a 20% chance of getting regrowth of most or all scalp hair (corresponding to SALT ≤20) after 24 
weeks of treatment are presented in Table 21. The combinations of these three risks (i.e., a 
simultaneous increase in all three risks) that would be acceptable to patients (US and EU) exceed the 
actual combinations of these three risks, as observed in the All-exposure pool.

Table 21: Maximum acceptable risks (MAR) in exchange for a 20% increase in the probability of 
SALT≤20 
Clinical efficacy and safety data in the quantitative Benefit/Risk analysis included the probability of hair 
regrowth on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes for the 50 mg QD, 30 mg QD and placebo arms in 
study B7981015, and the probabilities of serious infection, malignancy (including NMSC) and venous 
thromboembolism, from the All-Exposure Pool for all 50 mg. The risk probabilities for the AEP 
(expressed as risk per patient-year) were assumed to be 1-year risks and were converted to 3-year 
risks by multiplying these probabilities by 3. The risk probabilities for the placebo arm were assumed 
to be zero. For the purpose of comparing the net benefit of 50 mg QD to the net benefit of 30 mg QD it 
was assumed that the risk probabilities for the 30 mg QD dose were 0.60 times the observed risk of 
the 50 mg QD dose (proportional to dose).  
The mean net benefit of 50 mg QD exceeded the mean net benefit of placebo. Ritlecitinib 50 mg has 
0.122 higher NBR score than placebo, indicating a positive benefit-risk profile for the active treatment 
(Figure 26). The highest positive contribution to this difference is from the hair on the scalp (0.168), 
whereas the highest negative contribution is from the risk of cancer (-0.126). In simulations reflecting 
uncertainty in clinical outcomes, the probability that the mean net benefit of ritlecitinib 50 mg QD was 
greater than the mean net benefit of placebo was 99.8%. The predicted choice probability that any 
patient (US and EU combined) would choose ritlecitinib 50 mg QD over no treatment for AA was 
65.9%.

B7981072: A Discrete Choice Experiment for Alopecia Areata treatments with adolescents  
A similar experiment was conducted in adolescents. Relative attribute importance (RAI) values showed 
that the most important attribute for AA adolescent patients was the benefit of increasing from 0% to 
50% the chance of getting back most or all of the hair on their scalps after 24 weeks of treatment 
(RAI: 61.6%; 95% CI: [56.8; 66.4]). This was followed by a reduction in the risk of cancer from 6% to 
0.1% during three years of treatment (RAI: 14.1%, 95% CI: [10.4; 17.7]), the benefits of increasing 
the chance of getting moderate or normal eyebrows from 0% to 40% after 24 weeks (RAI: 13.2%; 
95% CI: [9.7; 16.6]), and the benefits of increasing the chance from 0 % to 40% of getting moderate 
or normal eyelashes after 24 weeks (RAI: 9.1%; 95% CI: [5.7; 12.6]). The reduction in the risk of 
serious infection from 6% to 0.1% during three years of treatment (RAI: 1.4%; 95% CI: [-2.7; 5.6]) 
and the risk of getting blood clots during three years of treatment (RAI: 0.6%; 95% CI: [-3.4; 4.6]) 
were less important. 
In addition, differences in preferences between the adolescents and adults were tested in an Error-
Component Multinomial Logit (ECL) model including additional interaction terms between the age 
group (adolescent vs adult) and the attributes’ levels. The chance to obtain hair on most or all of scalp 
was the most important attribute for both adults and adolescents, but adolescents patients cared 
significantly more about the scalp hair benefit than adult patients (p<0.001). Adult patients valued the 
‘no treatment’ option significantly more than adolescents (p<0.001), meaning they were more averse 
to the treatment burden solely for having to take a treatment, and not due to any benefits or risks it 
may provide. Adult patients were also significantly more averse to risks of serious infections and blood 
clots than adolescents (p<0.001). 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical programme to evaluate the efficacy of ritlecitinib in Alopecia Areata (AA) consists of 3 
studies: 1 pivotal study (B7981015), 1 supportive Phase 2a study (B7931005), and 1 long-term study 
(B7981032), all in participants with AA. The comparative safety study (B7981037) also included 
efficacy data.  
The applicant received CHMP Scientific Advice on the clinical development programme of ritlecitinib for 
the treatment of AA (EMEA/H/SA/3875/1/2018/HTA/III). The main points of the Advice regarding 
efficacy included to follow the recommendations of the EMA guideline for single pivotal studies such as 
setting a more stringent Type I error rate for the primary endpoint. The main inclusion criteria for the 
pivotal trial and the primary efficacy endpoint (SALT score ≤10) were deemed adequate by CHMP. 
Upon the advice of CHMP a measure of subjective treatment benefit, Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGI-C), was included as a key secondary endpoint. With respect to safety, following the 
observation of axonal dystrophy in the 9-month toxicity studies in dogs, the CHMP advised continuing 
audiological and neurological events as well as audiometry assessments in the phase 3 trial. This was 
implemented by the applicant in study 015. Furthermore, phase 2 safety study 037 addressed this 
issue by measuring brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) and intraepidermal nerve fibre (IENF) 
sampling. CHMP also recommended to consider a longer duration of the placebo-controlled study given 
that successful treatment of severe AA is expected to take longer than 24 weeks, especially if SALT10 
is the primary outcome. CHMP also proposed a staggered approach for the inclusion of adolescents so 
that adults' safety would be known first. As a consequence, adolescents had not been included in the 
EU, as agreed with the PDCO (as part of the agreed EU PIP); an indication for adolescents in the EU 
could be supported by an extrapolation approach to meet the applicable guidelines and regulations 
(ICH-E5, ICH E11-R1, the EMA's Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of

medicines for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) and the EU Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006). 
The CHMP Scientific advice has, overall, been followed. 
Main study 
The pivotal study B7981015 had a randomised, placebo-controlled period of 24 weeks followed by a 
non-placebo-controlled treatment extension phase of 24 weeks. As previously stated in the CHMP 
Scientific Advice, 24 weeks of a placebo-controlled trial might be too short for the treatment of AA, 
especially for a stringent primary outcome such as SALT≤10. The relatively short duration of the 
placebo-controlled phase would thus limit the interpretation of the (favourable and unfavourable) long-
term effects of ritlecitinib. The applicant kept the placebo-controlled period to 24 weeks but added an 
extension phase up to week 48. Overall, the length of the 24-week placebo-controlled period in 
combination with the follow-up phase to in total 48 weeks of exposure is considered acceptable. 
The dose-ranging design of the pivotal trial is also considered acceptable, although it yielded a low 
number of participants in each treatment group. Due to the difference in study designs between the 
pivotal and supportive studies, a pooled analysis couldn’t be performed for efficacy. The main efficacy 
study should thus be interpreted as a single pivotal trial. 
The CHMP SA to conduct a separate dose-ranging and confirmatory studies was not followed by the 
applicant. Nevertheless, the pivotal study complies with the EMA guideline (CPMP/EWP/2330/99) on 
single pivotal trial. There is a well-grounded pharmacologic rationale for the plausibility of ritlecitinib’s 
efficacy in AA and sufficient internal and external validity (demonstrated by, e.g. adequate blinding of 
all parties, randomisation of participants, well-justified inclusion and exclusion criteria). The proof of 
concept is considered established in study B7931005 for ritlecitinib 200/50 mg dose regimen. The 
effect sizes of primary and secondary outcomes are statistically significant at a level sufficient for a 
single pivotal trial and considered clinically relevant. Lastly, longer-term data indicated that the effect 
of ritlecitinib increases up to 24 months.  
Study participants 
The selected study population is representative of the target population, as reflected in the proposed 
indication. Even if there is no universally adopted definition of ‘severe AA’, this definition was also used 
for the indication of Olumiant in AA. Including participants with AT and AU is considered relevant. The 
exclusion criteria mainly concern safety measures and are not considered overly restrictive being in 
accordance with the known class effects of JAK inhibitors (e.g. serious infections, thromboembolic 
events, and malignancies). Since the renal route plays only a minor role in the elimination of 
ritlecitinib, excluding participants with renal impairment is unlikely to be a concern. Participants with a 
moderate hepatic impairment had a 30% (90% CI: 26% – 33%) higher Cmax and a 35% (90% CI: 
28% - 42%) higher AUCtau, which does not appear clinically relevant (see pharmacokinetic 
discussion).  
Study treatments 
The 5 ritlecitinib regimens in the main study consisted of ritlecitinib 200/50 mg, 50mg, 200/30 mg, 30 
mg and 10mg. Regarding the treatment received, ritlecitinib was administered by the participants, 
which inherently introduced dosing and compliance issues. It is, however, considered that reasonable 
effort was paid to evaluate compliance. The criteria for drug discontinuation and concomitant 
medication can be agreed upon. Incidences of protocol deviations and important protocol deviations in 
study B7981015 were high (96% and 68%, respectively) but similar across study groups. There was a 
comparable distribution of protocol deviations over study. Sensitivity analyses indicated that there was 
no substantial impact on the results i.e. the internal validity of the study is not compromised.

Outcomes 
The endpoints chosen in the pivotal study B7981015 are in line with the CHMP Scientific Advice and are 
considered acceptable. The primary endpoint was a response in SALT≤10 (≤10% scalp hair loss) at 
week 24. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of participants with patient-reported outcome 
PGI-C response defined as a score of ‘moderately improved’ or ‘greatly improved’ at Week 24. Other 
main secondary endpoints were: response based on SALT≤20 (i.e. ≤20% scalp hair loss) at week 24, 
SALT≤10 and ≤20 up to Week 48; change in eyebrow and eyelash response (EBA and ELA) with at 
least a 2-grade improvement from baseline or a score of 3 in EBA/ELA score through week 4-48; PGI-C 
response defined as a PGI-C score of ‘moderately improved’ or ‘greatly improved’ through week 4-48  
and change in baseline from another patient-reported outcome AAPPO response up to Week 48. SALT 
is a validated measure used in AA. SALT ≤10 is a stringent primary endpoint which, however, is 
supported by a less stringent secondary endpoint (i.e. SALT ≤20).  
Following the CHMP SA, a patient-reported outcome measure PGI-C response was included as a key 
secondary endpoint at 24 weeks. PGI-C is considered a valid tool for a key secondary outcome in the 
pivotal trial in AA. PGI-C is broadly used, and its outcomes are easily interpretable. EBA and ELA are a 
validated set of clinician-reported outcomes identical to the one reported in Wyrwich et al. (2020) and 
used for the registration of Olumiant in AA. Supportive studies used an identical set of outcomes. 
AAPPO was developed and validated by the applicant and the validation process is described in the 
Methods section above. 
Sample size, randomisation, and blinding 
Sample size calculations have been provided, including calculations for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints at the more stringent significance level of 1% in line with the NfG on single pivotal trial. The 
sample size for the pivotal is sufficiently motivated and considered acceptable with sufficient statistical 
power for the primary and key secondary endpoint. The analysis provided in this application requested 
primary and key secondary endpoints were controlled at the more stringent significance level of 1% 
and accounted for multiplicity using a closed testing procedure. 
A stratified randomisation was used with strata defined by adults versus adolescents and AT/AU versus 
not AT/AU. A block randomisation was used in the strata with blocks of size 11. Targets for overall and 
stratum-specific enrolment were monitored using blinded interactive response reports allowing for 
adjustment of the randomisation caps to keep numbers within limits specified in protocol.  
Planned unblinding only occurred after all Week 24 outcomes has been observed or patient 
discontinued before Week 24 visit. Unblinded data were restricted to the applicable unblinded reporting 
team members only. Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team were blinded to treatment 
throughout the duration of the study. Blinding is considered acceptable.  
Statistical analyses 
Statistical methods are generally considered acceptable. The family-wise type I error rate is controlled 
over the primary and key secondary endpoints for hypotheses regarding four treatment sequences. 
Multiple imputation under a missing-at-random and non-missing at random assumption for outcomes 
missing due to COVID-19 was used for analyses of the primary endpoint for SALT ≤ 10 and key 
secondary endpoint PGI-C at week 24. Patients with missing Week 24 outcomes not due to COVID-19 
were regarded non-responders. The strategy to consider subjects whose outcomes are missing for 
other reasons, such as discontinuation, as non-responders is acceptable.    
Several sensitivity analyses have been provided for the primary and key secondary endpoints to assess 
robustness to assumptions related to handling missingness due to COVID-19. The robustness of results 
to assumptions has been shown. The power of interaction test for loading dose is likely to be low.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study population 
The most frequent reasons for screen failure were exclusion criteria. Demographic characteristics were 
well balanced between the placebo and the ritlecitinib groups. Adolescents comprised about 15% of the 
study sample. The group of participants aged 65 years or older comprised less than 5%. Most patients 
had used prior therapies, in line with a severe AA population that is eligible for systemic treatment. 
The low proportion of elderly patients may hamper the interpretation of efficacy for in this sub-
population but is representative of the target population. A priori, there is no reason to believe that 
ritlecitinib will not be effective in the elderly, apart from confounding due to age-related androgenic 
alopecia. Correct diagnosis and prescription is, however, the responsibility of the prescribing physician. 
Completion 
A total of 718 participants was included in the pivotal study. The numbers of withdrawals in the 
ritlecitinib groups are low (5-8%), and the reasons for discontinuation or withdrawal were similar 
between ritlecitinib and placebo groups. The per-protocol population (defined as all randomised 
subjects with no major protocol deviation) consisted of 656 participants. 
Adherence and drug exposure 
Non-compliance of the investigational product between visits of <80% or >120% was to be reported 
as a protocol violation (referred to as ‘protocol deviation’ by the applicant). A total of 20 participants 
had compliance <80% between Day 1 through Week 24, and the numbers were similar between the 
groups. No participants had compliance >120%. Non-compliance was dealt with in the analysis as 
follows: first, the primary analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints were conducted 
according to the intent-to-treat principle on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which included all participants 
(regardless of non-compliance issues). The same analyses were then repeated on the Per Protocol 
Analysis Set (PPAS), which excluded participants who had major protocol deviations related to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, compliance regarding the investigational product, or any other major 
protocol deviations that, in the opinion of the sponsor study team, might have affected the efficacy 
data through Week 24. Participants were excluded from PPAS if, prior to the date of the Week 24 visit, 
the subject had a dosing interruption of ≥6 weeks for any reason. This approach is considered 
adequate. 
Prior and concomitant medication 
On average, 69% of participants had received prior pharmacologic treatment for AA. The most 
frequent treatment for AA were topical corticosteroids, oral/IV/IM steroids, intralesional corticosteroid 
injection and topical vasodilators, which is representative of a current treatment strategy of AA. These 
numbers were similar between the groups. 
Concomitant medication for conditions other than AA was taken by about 80% of the participants during 
the  double-blind  period  in  the  main  study,  without  differences  between  the  placebo  and  ritlecitinib 
groups.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  use  of  concomitant  medication  has  affected  the  outcome  since  it  was 
equally  divided  between  the  groups  and  is  unlikely  to  interfere  with  the  treatment.  A  maximum  of  1 
participant in each group reported using AA medication.  
Treatment effects  
The primary endpoint (SALT ≤10 at week 24) and the key secondary endpoint (PGI-C response at 
week 24) in the single pivotal trial were both met, with p<0.005 while correcting for multiplicity. 
Regarding SALT10 at week 24, the mean difference with placebo was the largest for the 200/50 mg 
group (20%) compared to the 200/30 mg group (11%), the 50 mg group (12%) and the 30 mg group 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 132/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(9%). The treatment effects were more pronounced with SALT≤20 at week 24 (secondary outcome) 
with 200/50 mg group (28%) compared to the 200/30 mg group (20%), the 50 mg group (21%) and 
the 30 mg group (12%); all differences with placebo were statistically significant.  
PGI-C outcome (key secondary outcome) was also significantly different from placebo at week 24 with 
effect size comparable between 200/50 and 50mg groups (40%) and between 200/30 and 30 mg 
groups (33%).  
Other secondary endpoints and the results on SALT and PGI-C in supportive studies corroborate these 
findings. By week 48 (at the end of the extension phase), the proportion of participants with SALT ≤10 
was similar between the participants who received a 200 mg loading dose for 4 weeks and those who 
were treated for 48 weeks without a loading dose: 200/50 mg (33%) versus 50 mg (31%); 200/30 mg 
(28%) versus 30 mg (25%). This supports the proposed posology of ritlecitinib 50mg QD.  
Although the treatment effect in SALT≤10 as the primary outcome appears numerically small (21.29%  
vs 1.54% for ritlecitinib 200/50 dose and placebo respectively), it is considered clinically relevant. The 
reason is that SALT≤10 is a rather stringent measure (‘near remission’), and 24 weeks is relatively 
short, while the clinical relevance is also supported by the larger treatment effects in SALT≤20 and 
PGI-C. 
Long-term treatment effect 
The duration of treatment of AA is likely to constitute more than 24 weeks. The data from the 
extension phase showed that the proportion of participants with a low SALT score continues to increase 
beyond 24 weeks with ritlecitinib 50 mg. This notion is further corroborated by supportive studies 
B7981037 and B7981032. In study B7981037, the difference between ritlecitinib and placebo in SALT 
response further increases between 6 and 9 months. The preliminary results from the open-label study 
B7981032 in the rollover group (i.e. the group of participants who had already had ritlecitinib either in 
study B7981015 or B7931005) suggest that the number of participants with SALT ≤10 continues to 
increase up to additional 15-18 months.  
Based on the available clinical data, the treatment effect does not appear to fade away on prolonged 
treatment.  
Dose 
As the most appropriate dose (30 mg or 50 mg, with or without a loading dose of 200 mg for 4 weeks) 
was not apparent before the pivotal study began, the applicant chose not to perform a dose-finding 
study before starting the pivotal study. The choice for the dose in the proof-of-concept study (200/50 
mg) was based on non-clinical safety margins. 
The applicant proposes the 50 mg dose without loading dose as the recommended dose in the SmPC, 
mainly for safety reasons. From the efficacy point of view, it can be agreed that 50 mg without loading 
dose is an effective alternative to the 200/50 mg regimen. From the 0–24-week data of the pivotal 
study, it appears that for SALT≤10 and SALT≤20, the 50 mg QD with 200 mg loading dose for 4 weeks 
(200/50) is the most effective dose. The effect of 200/30 mg resembles that of 50/50 mg and is less 
prominent than of 200/50 mg. For PGI-C at week 24 however, the 200/50 mg and 50/50 mg doses 
were similarly effective. At 48 weeks of treatment, the 200/50 mg dose and the 50/50 mg dose were 
equally effective, which is conceivable as the effect of the loading dose will diminish over time. At 24 
and 48 weeks, the 30 mg dose was less effective than the 50 mg dose in all outcomes. A longer-term 
simulation analysis also indicated that a 14% loss in SALT ≤20 response at week 156 would be 
expected when the dose is reduced from 50 mg to 30 mg. The most important rationale for dose 
reduction would be to lower the risk of adverse drug effects, mostly infections, in a vulnerable 
population, such as the elderly. A warning regarding this risk is already incorporated in Section 4.4 of 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 133/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the SmPC. Further, the analysis of predicted choice probability in the adult patient preference study 
revealed that a predicted choice probability for the 30 mg dose was either similar to 50 mg (with 
overlapping confidence intervals) or lower than for the 50 mg dose, indicating no patient preference for 
a lower dose. Overall, considering a greater efficacy of 50 mg as compared to 30 mg, a relatively low 
infection risk for both 50 and 30 mg of ritlecitinib in the general AA population and in the elderly, 
elderly not being a major target population for ritlecitinib given the demographic characteristics and 
the presence of a warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the infection risk, a maintenance dose 
of 50 mg is considered appropriate. 
Treatment withdrawal 
In the SmPC, it was initially proposed to discontinue patients who show no evidence of therapeutic 
benefit after 48 weeks. There is, however, a paucity of data to support this discontinuation criterion. 
The results from the single-blinded phase of study B7931005 show that additional treatment in non-
responders (previously treated with ritlecitinib) after week 24 does not lead to a substantial response. 
The difference from baseline in SALT score was only 7% more than placebo (90% CI 0.75-13) after 
additional 24 weeks of treatment. The number of analysed participants is, however, very small 
(N=13). Given the current paucity of data, the duration of treatment of responders with ritlecitinib 
cannot be established. The inclusion of a stopping rule in the SmPC in case of non-response is 
endorsed. Based on the updated data from study 032, 9 months (36 weeks) is a more adequate 
moment for discontinuation. The SmPC section 4.2 was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the 
probability of being a non-responder (failure to reach a reduction of at least 30% from baseline on 
SALT scores) at Month 18 based on percent change from baseline at an earlier visit (negative 
predictive value) was similar for 9 and 12 months. The two highest negative predictive values 
associated with not meeting the percent change from baseline of 10% and 20% were 77% and 75% at 
Month 9 and 77% and 73% at Month 12. Further, stopping ritlecitinib appears to lead to a loss of 
response. A simulation analysis showed that 66% of SALT ≤10 responders are predicted to lose SALT 
≤20 response and 70% are predicted to lose SALT ≤10 response with up to 48 weeks of treatment 
interruption (after being treated with ritlecitinib for 96 weeks). After treatment withdrawal for up to 6 
weeks, the risk of losing SALT ≤20 response was, however, low (<5%), which is reflected in the SmPC, 
section 4.2.  
Adolescents 
The proposed indication includes adolescents (≥12 years of age), and in the pivotal study, 105 
adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) were included. All adolescents were recruited outside of the EU. 
The applicant has performed an extrapolation exercise to compare efficacy in ex-EU adolescents with 
ex-EU adults and EU adults. The extrapolation is acceptable, and it can be assumed that the 
pathophysiology of AA is not different in adolescents as compared to adults. The analysis in the pivotal 
study shows that the effects on SALT≤10 and PGI-C in adolescents are in accordance with the findings 
in ex-EU adults and EU adults and are further supported by the similarity in less stringent SALT≤20 
response and dose-response relationship for SALT≤10 at week 24 between adolescents and adults. 
Furthermore, the absolute SALT score decreases similarly in adolescents as compared to adults up to 
week 48 and further up to month 24 (as shown by All Exposure Cohort based on pooled efficacy data 
from studies B7981015 and B7981032). Therefore, it is considered that the effects on adults can be 
generalised to EU adolescents. 
Elderly participants 
Only a few elderly participants were enrolled in the main study (<5%). The SmPC section 4.2 was 
updated to reflect that there are limited data in patients ≥ 65 years of age.  
Assessment report

Page 134/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AT/AU patients 
The effect size in AT/AU patients for ritlecitinib is smaller than for non-AT/AU patients for both SALT ≤
10 and SALT ≤20 endpoints at week 24. This is reflected in the section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Other subgroups 
While for the subgroup ‘AA Duration Since Disease Diagnosis’ the difference between ritlecitinib and 
placebo was not significant for the stringent SALT ≤10 outcome at week 24, this difference was 
significant for other relevant endpoints SALT ≤20 and PGI-C at various timepoints.  
Other subgroup analysis by age, BMI , gender, race, region, prior treatment did not indicate an effect 
modification. 
Patient preferences 
The performance of studies to acquire patient preferences for AA treatments in adults and adolescents 
is appreciated. Both studies appear to be well-performed using standard methodologies, including 
relevance of attributes, understandability of questions in the Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE), 
appropriate figures for observed favourable and unfavourable treatment effects, and use of statistical 
methods and approaches. The samples of adults and adolescents are considered representative of the 
target population and large enough. Data for the preferences of favourable and unfavourable effects 
were acquired from the DCE. Data for favourable effects on the return of scalp hair (SALT≤20) and 
return of eyebrows (EBA) and eyelashes (ELA) came from the 24-week data of pivotal study 015. For 
unfavourable effects regarding the 3-years risks for serious infections, cancer, and blood clots, 
incidence rates of exposure to 50 mg in the All-exposure pool were used.  
The probabilities for favourable effects are realistic, though the treatment effect of ritlecitinib has not 
been completed at week 24, as the effect increases up to week 48. The risk estimates for the 
unfavourable effects are endorsed, although the size of the risk is still uncertain due to the low 
frequencies and the relatively short period of observation.  
According to the results, the by far most important attribute to patients is a return of most or all scalp 
hair (42%), which was valued much more than the return of eyebrows (12%) or eyelashes (9.2%). In 
ranking, the return of scalp hair was followed by the 3-year acceptable risk for infections (13%) and 3-
year risk of cancer (13%), while the 3-year risk for blood clots (11%) was valued as less important. 
When coupled with the actual trial results in the quantitative Benefit/Risk analysis, it showed that 
ritlecitinib 50 mg has 0.122 higher Net Benefit/Risk score than placebo, which indicates a positive 
benefit-risk profile for the active treatment from the patient perspective. Mathematically, this returns 
in a predicted choice probability of 66%. This means that more than half, or a small majority, of the 
‘average’ adult patients with AA can be expected to prefer ritlecitinib 50 mg over no treatment when 
making an informed choice. Based on the patient preference study in adolescents, it can be expected 
that the Net Benefit/Risk ratio in adolescents also shows a preference for ritlecitinib 50 mg over no 
treatment. Although no quantitative Benefit/Risk analysis in adolescents was performed, compared 
with adults, they placed more value on the return of scalp hair and less (virtually no) value on the risk 
for serious infections and blood clots. Given the high value that patients with severe AA place on scalp 
hair regrowth, the NBR difference of 0.12 and predicted choice probability of 66% are probably on the 
low side, though the net B/R for ritlecitinib 50 mg, as compared to no treatment, is positive from the 
patient perspective.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single pivotal study in adolescent and adult participants with AA treated with ritlecitinib, the 
primary endpoint (SALT ≤10 response at week 24) and the key secondary endpoint (PGI-C response at 
week 24) were both met, with multiplicity corrected p-values <0.005. The treatment effect is 
supported by the results of the secondary outcomes, by a clear dose-response effect, and is consistent 
over virtually all predefined sub-populations, including adolescents. The treatment effect continues to 
increase after week 24, up to 24 months and is maintained on treatment beyond 24 months. 
Although the treatment effect in SALT≤10 as a primary outcome appears numerically small, SALT ≤10 
is a stringent measure indicating a near remission. The responses in the secondary outcomes (PGI-C, 
SALT ≤20, EBA, ELA) are larger and support clinical relevance. From an efficacy point of view, it is 
agreed that 50 mg without loading dose is an effective alternative to the 200/50 mg regimen over 
time. 
Although this application is based on a single pivotal trial, this trial is considered methodologically 
adequate and sufficiently demonstrated efficacy as revealed by primary and secondary outcomes at 
various time-points and across various subgroups.  
Based on the patient preference studies in adults and adolescents, it is estimated that a small majority 
of the ‘average’ patient with AA can be expected to prefer ritlecitinib 50 mg over no treatment when 
making an informed choice.  
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy data supports the following indication: ‘Litfulo is indicated for the 
treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older (see section 
5.1)’. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Main safety studies 
The clinical development programme of ritlecitinib in AA was a global programme including 21 phase 1 
studies, 4 phase 2/phase 3 studies in AA and 1 phase 2b study in vitiligo (Table 22). The study in 
vitiligo was considered relevant for the evaluation of safety in AA due to similarities between the AA 
and vitiligo populations, similar ritlecitinib dosing regimens to those in the AA studies, and similar 
safety monitoring in vitiligo and AA study protocols.

Supportive study (B7981037) 
This study was designed to investigate the clinical relevance of non-clinical findings of axonal 
dystrophy with audiological consequences. In dog chronic toxicity studies, axonal dystrophy was 
associated with brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) changes at the highest exposure in those 
studies. Therefore, the BAEP interwave I-V latency was the primary endpoint for this study. Axonal

swelling and intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) were evaluated in peripheral skin biopsies. The 
technique allowed direct assessments of both morphological features (such as axonal swellings) and 
IENFD in nerve endings. 
The objective was to assess I-V interwave latency of brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEPs) and 
to assess axonal swellings in intraepidermal nerve endings (IENF), in adult participants with AA treated 
with ritlecitinib.  
The design was a phase 2a, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled safety study 
designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ritlecitinib, including the assessments of BAEP and 
IENF, in adults 18 to ≤50 years of age with ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA. Approximately 60 adults 
were randomised (1:1) to either ritlecitinib 200/50 mg or placebo. The placebo-controlled phase lasted 
for 9 months, followed by an active treatment phase of 15 months and a safety follow-up of 4 weeks. 
At month 6, all participants with a baseline SALT ≤75 and an increase (worsening) in SALT≥25 points 
could already enter the active treatment phase. 
Main inclusion criteria were: ≥25% hair loss due to AA as measured by SALT; normal hearing and 
BAEP; normal neurological examination. Patients were excluded if having clinically significant 
neurological diseases, diseases that may lead to hearing loss, or had first-degree relatives with 
hereditary neuropathy. 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in I-V interwave latency on BAEP at a stimulus 
intensity of 80 dB at Month 9. Secondary outcomes included: the I-V interwave latency at month 6 
and 15; change from baseline in axonal dystrophy and of intraepidermal nerve endings density in skin 
punch biopsies at months 9 and 15; absence of wave V on BAEP at stimulus intensities ranging from 
80 dB to 40 dB at months 6, 9 and 15; occurrence of TEAS, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation. 
For the primary safety endpoint, there was no formal hypothesis testing; summary statistics for each 
group with 95% confidence intervals were provided.  
Data pools 
There were 4 study pools to summarise the clinical safety of ritlecitinib: 2 pools (PCPAA and PCPAAV) 
focused on short-term (up to 24 weeks) placebo-controlled treatment, 1 pool (OYEP) focused on 1-
year (up to 48 weeks) treatment, and 1 pool (AEP) focused on participants from the same studies as in 
the other pools with a longer duration of exposure to ritlecitinib, as well as the LTE study. The data of 
the phase 1 studies were not pooled, due to differences in study design, doses studied, short study 
durations and the inconsistent availability of a placebo comparator. 
The placebo-controlled pools PCPAA (and PCPAAV) included studies B7931005 (0-24 weeks), 
B7981015 (0-24 Weeks), and B7981037 (0 24 weeks), with similar doses of ritlecitinib, similar patient 
populations, and comparable safety outcome assessments, as well as study B7981019 (0-24 weeks) in 
Vitiligo. This cohort included participants who were randomised and received: 200/50 mg QD from all 
studies; 50/50 mg QD from B7981015 (and B7981019); All 50 mg (200/50 mg QD and 50/50 mg QD 
combined) from all studies; All 30 mg (200/30 mg QD and 30/30 mg QD combined) from B7981015 
(and B7981019); 10 mg QD from B7981015 (and B7981019); placebo QD from all studies. 
The one-year exposure pool (OYEP) included only the ritlecitinib-treated participants from B7981015 
who received a continuous dose regimen (0-48 weeks). Participants who were randomised to placebo 
up to Week 24 and then switched to active treatment were not included in this pool. 
The all-exposure pool (AEP) included the same studies (B7931005, B7981015, B7981019, B7981037) 
included in the placebo-controlled pools, but not limited to their 24-week placebo-controlled portions. 
‘Rollover’ data from the long-term, open-label study B7981032 plus data from ‘de novo’ participants 
enrolled into study B7981032 were included. All participants who received ritlecitinib, from the start of 
Assessment report 
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 138/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their first dose of ritlecitinib in one of these studies, were included in this pool. The ritlecitinib exposure 
to 50 mg treatment was evaluated from the time a participant started the 50 mg dose or the preceding 
loading dose. For example, for participants who received 30 mg QD in B7981015 and then 50 mg in 
B7981032, the summary for these participants starts from the time they first received 50 mg. 
In addition to AA and vitiligo, ritlecitinib is also being investigated for RA (completed Phase 2 study 
B7981006 and Phase 2 study B7921023 in combination with another kinase inhibitor), UC (completed 
Phase 2 study B7981005), and Crohn’s disease (ongoing Phase 2 study B7981007). These studies in 
non-dermatological indications were not pooled due to the differences in patient characteristics. 
Data collection and adjudication 
AEs presented in the pooled datasets have been coded using the MedDRA version 24.1. Adjudication 
committees independent of the applicant were established to review potential AEs of opportunistic 
infections (Ois), malignancies/histopathology, CV events, and neurological and audiological events of 
interest. Each of these committees consisted of experts in the relevant field, with charters in place to 
describe the details of event definitions and the committee’s purpose. 
In study B7981015, to assess for potential changes in hearing status, routine audiologic testing 
(including pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry and immittance audiometry) was implemented 
throughout the study at pre-specified time points (at Screening or within 8 weeks prior to Study Day 1, 
and at Study Days 169 and 337 or early termination visit). TEAEs reported as audiologic events of 
interest reflect the outcome of the protocol-specified audiologic testing (there were no spontaneously 
reported events of hearing loss). 
Real World Data cohorts of patients with hospital-treated Alopecia Areata (AA) to characterise the 
patient population and contextualise safety events within the Ritlecitinib AA clinical development 
programme (B7981049) 
To better understand the epidemiology of hospital-treated AA, including AT/AU, a population-based 
cohort study was conducted using real-world data collected from Denmark’s national health registries.  
The main objectives were to estimate background rates of safety events of interest in the AA Cohort 
and AA trial-similar (TS) Sub-cohort (overall, by AA subtype and age subgroup); and to estimate the 
prevalence of comorbidities with known/potential associations with AA. 
The study design was a historical population-based cohort study based on routinely collected data 
from administrative and health registers in Denmark. Patients with hospital-treated AA were identified 
based on primary or secondary diagnoses between 1995 and 2016, recorded at inpatient hospital stays 
or during outpatient visits to hospital-based specialist clinics. In addition, a subset of those who were 
similar to the ritlecitinib AA clinical trial programme were also identified as a sub cohort. The follow-up 
was extended through the end of 2016 for all endpoints except major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) and cardiovascular deaths; the follow-up for MACE and cardiovascular death was extended 
through the end of 2011, the date of the last update of cause-of-death data. The lookback period 
extended to 01 January 1977 for diagnoses and to 01 January 2004 for medications, based on 
available data from the relevant sources. The variables of interest included AA diagnosis at a hospital 
encounter; demographic and clinical characteristics; and select safety events of importance to the 
ritlecitinib clinical programme. The following data sources were used in this study: the Danish Civil 
Registration System, the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR), Danish Health Services Prescription 
Database, and the Danish Register of Causes of Death (updated through 2011). 
Between 1995 and 2016, 4,014 cases of hospital-treated AA were identified, the AA incident cohort 
included 2,778 patients (472 AT/AU, 2306 non-AT/AU), 60.4% of the patients were between 18 – 50 
years old at first hospital AA diagnosis, and men comprised 36.9% of the total incident AA cohort. The 
Assessment report

trial-similar sub cohort (TS) included 2,232 (80% of the incident cohort) patients, with 
characteristics similar to those of the total AA cohort. Crude incidence rates for the trial-similar sub 
cohort are given and discussed within the section on Adverse events of special interest. 
Epidemiology and risk characterisation of Alopecia Areata via external patient cohorts within a US 
administrative database (B7981051) 
The aim of this study, conducted retrospectively within a US healthcare claims database, was to inform 
risk characterisation efforts in support of the ritlecitinib clinical trial programme and product 
registration. For that purpose, data were collected in three cohorts of patients: a) AA cohort, b) a 
subset of the AA cohort that is similar to the ritlecitinib AA clinical trial programme and c) non-AA 
cohort. 
The main objectives were to estimate background incidence rates of safety events of interest 
identified in the ritlecitinib AA clinical programme; and to estimate the prevalence of comorbidities with 
known/potential associations with AA. 
The study design was a retrospective descriptive cohort study of patients 12 years of age and older 
within the United States embedded within the Optum Claims Database. A study period from October 1, 
2016 to September 30, 2020, was selected to reflect the most current and complete data in the Optum 
Claims Database. The study population consisted of patients diagnosed with AA from the administrative 
database and a subset of those who were similar to the characteristics of the patients enrolled in the 
ritlecitinib AA clinical trial programme. In addition, a non-AA cohort was utilised in this study to provide 
descriptive analysis of characteristics and background rates of selected safety events of a general 
population without AA who were matched by age, sex and race to patients in the AA cohort. Outcome 
variables included selected safety events (eg, sensorineural hearing loss, serious infections, cancer, 
cardiovascular events, all cause death) and immunologic and psychiatric co-morbidities (eg, atopic 
dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression). 
The final cohorts identified for this study were 8,784 patients with ≥2 diagnosis codes for AA and 
26,352 non-AA patients matched by age, sex and race to patients in the AA cohort. In addition, a 
trial-similar sub cohort of AA patients (n= 5,370) met the criteria set for similarity to the ritlecitinib 
AA clinical trial study B7981015. Among the trial-similar AA sub cohorts the ranges in IR per 1,000 Pys 
were 11.4 for serious infections to 5.5 for herpes zoster and 12.9 for herpes simplex infections; 10.0 
for any primary malignancies; 12.0 for MACE; and 27.2 for sensorineural hearing loss. Crude incidence 
rates for the trial-similar sub cohort are further given and discussed within the section on Adverse 
events of special interest. 
Exposure 
In the phase 2/3 studies, there were 1521 participants (1763 patient years) exposed to ritlecitinib 50 
mg or higher. There were 1011 participants with at least 12 months (48 weeks) exposure and there 
were 1334 participants who had ≥6 months exposure to ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher. Among these 
participants, 172 were adolescents, including 133 adolescents with at least 48 weeks of exposure to 
ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher.

Table 23: Cumulative exposure during AA and Vitiligo phase 2/3 studies 
During the procedure, additional safety data from the ongoing studies with a data cut-off of 30 May 
2022 were provided. This updated All exposure pool included 1630 participants with 2303 PY of 
exposure to ritlecitinib. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
The placebo-controlled AA pool consists of the data from 0-24 weeks of studies 005, 015 and 037. 
There were n=130 patients who were treated with the 50 mg QD dose as is applied for (denoted as 
50/50 mg), n=215 patients who were treated with 50 mg QD preceded by the 4 week loading dose of 
200 mg (200/50 mg), which makes n=345 for these two regimens combined (50 mg) and n=261 for 
the 30 mg regimens with and without loading dose combined (30 mg); n=213 patients were treated 
with placebo (Table 24). 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE was 75% in the 50/50 mg group and 70% in the 
placebo group. Over all dose regimens (placebo, 10 mg, 30 mg, 50/50 mg and 200/50 mg) the 
proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE was quite similar with ~70% for most dose regimens, 
except for the 50/50 mg group where this was 5%-point higher. The proportion of patients with at 
least 1 treatment-related TEAE was 33% in the 200/50 mg group, 36% in the 50/50 mg group and 
32% in the placebo group. 
The proportions of patients with at least 1 SAE or at least 1 severe AE were 0 and 1.5% in the 50/50 
mg group and 1.9% and 2.3% in the placebo group. Over all dose regimens, the 50/50 mg group had 
the lowest numbers of patients with SAEs, in the 200/50 mg group, 4 patients (1.9%) had at least 1 
SAE/severe AE.  
The proportions of patients who discontinued permanently or temporary with the study drug due to 
AEs were 1.5% and 10% in the 50/50 mg group and 2.3% and 3.8% in the placebo group. Over all 
dose regimens, the number of permanent discontinuations was lowest in the 50/50 mg group, but the 
number of patients with temporary discontinuations was highest.

Table 24: Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events in the placebo-controlled AA pool (0-24 
weeks) 
In the placebo-controlled AAV pool, with the addition of the data from the vitiligo trial, the 
proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE became 77% in the 50/50 mg group, 74% in the 200/50 
mg group, and 71% in the placebo group. The proportions of patients with at least 1 SAE were 0.5% 
(n=1) in the 50/50 mg group, 1.4% (n=4) in the 200/50 mg group, and 1.8% (n=5) in the placebo 
group. The proportions of patients with at least 1 severe AE were 3.6% (n=7) in the 50/50 mg group, 
2.1% (n=6) in the 200/50 mg group, and 2.5% (n=7) in the placebo group. The proportions of 
patients who discontinued permanently or temporarily with the study drug due to AEs were 3.6% and 
9.6% in the 50/50 mg group and 2.9% and 5.0% in the placebo group, while these were 2.9% and 
8.2% in the 200/50 mg group. 
In the one-year exposure pool, of the 0-48 week data of pivotal study 015, the proportion of 
patients with at least 1 TEAE was 84% in the 50 mg group, 80% in the 30 mg group, and 77% in the 
10 mg group (Table 25). The proportion of patients with at least 1 treatment-related TEAE was 44% in 
the 50 mg group, 41% in the 30 mg group and 39% in the 10 mg group. The proportions of patients 
with at least 1 SAE or at least 1 severe AE were 2.3% and 2.7% in the 50 mg group, 1.1% and 5.7% 
in the 30 mg group, and 3.3% and 3.3% in the 10 mg group. The proportions of patients who 
permanently discontinued the study drug due to AEs were 3% in all three dose groups. The proportions 
of patients who discontinued the study drug temporarily due to AEs were 14% and 12% in the 50 mg 
and 30 mg dose groups, and 8% in the 10 mg group.

Common Adverse Events  
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the most frequent events (2% in any treatment group) that 
occurred more commonly (>1%) in the ritlecitinib 50/50 mg group than in the placebo group included: 
nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, headache, acne, urticaria, rash, upper abdominal pain, pyrexia, folliculitis, 
SARS-CoV-2 test positive and Covid-19, dizziness, and atopic dermatitis (Table 26). In addition, 
tinnitus, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, blood creatinine phosphokinase increased, and back pain, 
were more common in the 50 mg dose groups as compared to placebo. Lower respiratory tract 
infections and pneumonia did not occur in the PCPAA pool. 
Regarding audiological AEs, there were 6 cases (2.8%) of tinnitus in the 200/50 mg group, no cases in 
the 50/50 mg group, one case each in the 30 mg and 10 mg groups, and 2 cases (0.9%) in the 
placebo group. Hypoacusis was found in 1 case in the placebo group, not in the ritlecitinib groups. 
Infections and infestations (SOC) occurred in 38% of patients in the combined 50 mg group, in 37% in 
the 30 mg group, in 32% in the 10 mg group and in 31% of the placebo group; this proportion was 
higher in the 200/50 mg group (41%) as compared to the 50/50 mg group (33%). Herpes zoster was 
infrequent, but occurred in 2 patients (1.5%) of the 50/50 mg group and in 2 patients (0.8%) of the 
30 mg group, but not in the 10 mg group or the placebo group. 
Fractures were uncommon. In 3 patients fractures had occurred: an occasion of hand fracture in the 30 
mg group, a rib fracture in the 10 mg group, a humerus fracture in the placebo group.  
In the placebo-controlled AAV pool, the pattern of common TEAEs was similar as compared to the 
AA pool. In the placebo-controlled Vitiligo trial, the most common (≥5%) TEAEs were similar as 
occurred in the AA pool. Acne, urticaria, and diarrhoea were more frequent in the ritlecitinib treatment 
groups, as compared to placebo.

In the one-year exposure pool, the most common TEAEs in the ritlecitinib groups were similar to 
those in the placebo-controlled AA pool, including diarrhoea, nausea, folliculitis, nasopharyngitis, 
urinary tract infections, headache, and acne (Table 27). Diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory 
tract infections, dizziness, acne and urticaria were more frequent in the highest, 50 mg and 30 mg 
dose groups compared to the 10 mg group. 
Pyrexia was more frequent in the 50 mg group (3.8%) as compared to the 30 mg (1.5%) and 10 mg 
(1.6%) groups.  
There were 4 (1.5%) cases of tinnitus in the 50 mg group, 3 (1.1%) in the 30 mg group, and 1 (1.6%) 
in the 10 mg group. Neurosensory deafness occurred in 4 (2.6%) participants in the 50 mg group, 5 
(1.9%) in the 30 mg group, and 0 participants of the 10 mg group. There was 1 case of unilateral 
deafness in the 50 mg group. Dizziness occurred in 13 (5%) of the participants in the 50 mg group, 16 
(6.1%) in the 30 mg group, and 1 (1.6%) in the 10 mg group. 
Infections and infestations (SOC) were more frequent in the 50 mg group (51%), as compared to the 
30 mg (47%) and the 10 mg (40%) groups. Of the most frequent infections, nasopharyngitis (14% 
and 16% versus 9.7%), upper respiratory tract infections (11% and 11% versus 3.2%), and urinary 
tract infections (4.6% and 3.1% versus 0), were more frequent in the 50 mg and 30 mg groups, 
versus the 10 mg group. In analysing the concentration-response relationship of ritlecitinib with 
infections, there appeared to be a statistically significant relationship of exposure with the occurrence 
of infections. The included AE categories of interest were moderate, severe, and infections leading to 
discontinuation.  
No additional fractures occurred as compared to the placebo-controlled period of 0-24 weeks.

Dose-response for infections 
In the all-exposure pool, the model-estimated slope for the effect of time-weighted Cav on the mean 
incidence of infection events was statistically significant (95% CI of estimate did not include zero). 
Over the range of relevant doses, an approximately 10-fold increase in ritlecitinib exposure (geometric 
mean Cav of 27 ng/mL [30 mg QD] vs 257 ng/mL [200 mg QD]), was predicted to demonstrate a less 
than 2-fold increase in the mean incidence of infections per 100 patient-years (11.0 vs 33.2, 
respectively). The IR/100 PY (95% CI) of infections for chronic ritlecitinib administration of 30 mg and 
50 mg QD was 11.0 (9.61, 12.7) and 13.5 (11.9, 15.4), respectively. The IR/100 PY (95% CI) 
following 1-year of ritlecitinib treatment for 200/50 mg was 14.9 (13.1, 16.9) compared with that for a 
50 mg QD continuous dosing regimen of 13.5 (11.9, 15.3).

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the placebo-controlled phases (0-24 weeks) of the AA trials (005, 015, 
037) or in the Vitiligo trial (019), or in the one-year follow-up phase of the AA pivotal trial (015). In 
the phase 1 programme, no deaths occurred. 
In the All-Exposure Pool, there were 2 deaths (breast cancer (spindle cell carcinoma) of a patient in 
her 60’s; acute respiratory failure and cardiorespiratory arrest in a patient in her 50’s) both on 50 
mg, and there was one death (severe myocardial infarction on Study Day 50 of a patient in his 
50’s) in the clinical study programme for Ulcerative Colitis. The three events were considered as 
unrelated to treatment by the investigators.  
Serious Adverse Events 
In the Placebo-controlled AA pool, there were 4 (1.9%) participants with at least one SAE in the 
200/50 mg group, none in the 50/50 mg group, 1 (0.4%) in the 30 mg group, 2 (3.2%) in the 10 
mg group, and 4 (1.9%) in the placebo group. Across treatment groups, the SOC that included the 
highest number of participants with SAEs was Infections and Infestations (4 events, in n=3 
participants). No individual PT SAE was reported for more than 1 participant in any treatment 
group. 
The SAEs in the 200/50 mg group were: three instances of serious infections (appendicitis, 
empyema, and sepsis), a case of breast carcinoma, and a spontaneous abortion.  
Three participants discontinued the study due to an SAE: eczema (10 mg), invasive lobular breast 
carcinoma (200/50 mg), and sepsis (200/50 mg). 
In the Placebo-controlled Vitiligo trial, there was one SAE in the 50/50 mg group and also one 
additional SAE in each of the 30 mg group, the 10 mg group and the placebo group. These were 
additional SAEs of migraine (2 participants, 1 each in 50/50 mg and 10 mg, oesophageal spasm (1 
participant, 30 mg), and neurogenic bladder (1 participant, placebo). 
One participant had discontinued the study due to an SAE: migraine (10 mg). 
In the one-year exposure pool, the SOCs of ‘Infections and Infestations’ and of ‘Neoplasms’ 
included the highest proportions of participants with SAEs (Table 28). There were relatively more 
participants with an SAE in the 50 mg group (n=6, 2.3%) as compared to the 30 mg group (1.1%) 
but not the 10 mg group (3.2%). SAEs that had occurred in the 50 mg group were: appendicitis, 
empyema, sepsis, breast cancer and invasive lobular breast cancer, spontaneous abortion, and 
pulmonary embolism. SAEs of appendicitis, diverticulitis, chemical poisoning, and suicidal 
behaviour had occurred in the 30 mg group. In the 10 mg group, there was a SAE of suicidal 
behaviour and one of eczema. 
Compared with the placebo-controlled AA pool/period, 3 additional participants with SAEs were 
discontinued from pivotal study 015: 1 each with pulmonary embolism (50 mg), breast cancer (50 
mg), and suicidal behaviour (30 mg).

Table 28: Serious adverse events in the one-year exposure pool of study 015 
In the All-exposure pool, the IR/100 PY (95% CI) of SAEs in the AEP All 50 mg group was 2.72 
(2.03 – 3.57) which was 2.69 (0.85, 6.48) in the All 50 mg group of the placebo-controlled AA 
pool.  
In the All 50 mg group, the ‘Infections and Infestations’ SOC included the highest proportion 
(n=12, 0.8%) of participants with SAEs, followed by ‘Neoplasms’ (n=9, 0.6%); there were 2 cases 
of ‘Cardiac disorders’ (acute myocardial infarction and cardio-respiratory arrest), and 1 case of 
pulmonary embolism, classified within ‘Respiratory disorders’. 
SAEs that were reported by ≥2 participants in Any Ritlecitinib included (preferred term): 
appendicitis (n=5), breast cancer and invasive lobular breast carcinoma (n=3 and n=1, 
respectively), abortion spontaneous (n=3), acute respiratory failure (n=3), COVID-19 (n=2), 
COVID-19 pneumonia (n=2), migraine (n=2), and suicidal behaviour (n=2). 
2.6.8.4.  Adverse events of special interest  
Infections, malignancies and NMSC, MACE and thromboembolic events, neurological and 
audiological findings were handled as Adverse Events of Special Interest (Table 29).

Neurological and audiological events 
In safety study 037, the PD safety outcomes did not show differences between the ritlecitinib 
(200/50 mg) group and the placebo group over 9 months. Events of neurosensory hearing loss or 
deafness did not occur in the study. 
A total of 71 participants were included: 36 participants were randomised to 200/50 mg and 35 
were randomised to placebo. Of these, 6 (8.5%) participants discontinued during the placebo-
controlled phase: 4 in 200/50 mg and 2 in placebo. 
There was no effect of ritlecitinib compared to placebo on BAEP I-V interwave latency at 80dB nHL 
at month 9 (primary outcome), and there was no effect of ritlecitinib on BAEP Wave V amplitude at 
80dB nHL or on the absence of BAEP wave V, on intraepidermal nerve fiber density, or on 
percentage of intraepidermal nerve fibers with axonal swellings (secondary outcomes). There were 
no events adjudicated by the neurological adjudication committee as meeting criteria for 
sensorineural hearing loss or central hearing disorder. 
The baseline mean (SD) value (ms) of I-V interwave latency on BAEP at 80 dB was 4.085 (0.1614) 
in 200/50 mg and 3.989 (0.1946) in placebo on the right side, and 4.103 (0.1531) in 200/50 mg 
and 3.988 (0.2235) in placebo on the left side. There were no within-group changes and no 
statistically significant differences in change from baseline in I-V interwave latency between 200/50 
mg and placebo on either side (Table 30, Figure 27). The mean I-V interwave latency values 
remained within the range of published normative data of mean (SD) 4.0 (0.21) ms. The 6 months 
data gave the same picture. There also were no within- or between group changes in mean (SD) 
value (μV) of amplitude of Wave V on BAEP at 80 dB on right or left sides, at 6 or 9 months. All 
participants had Wave V on BAEP present at stimulus intensities ranging from 80 dB to 40 dB up to 
Month 9 except for 1 participant.

The intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) values for ritlecitinib 200/50 mg and placebo were 
consistent with published normal ranges both at baseline and Month 9. Change from baseline to 
month 9 in mean and median IENFD was minimal and similar between ritlecitinib 200/50 mg and 
placebo groups. Change from baseline to month 9 in percentage of IENFs with axonal swellings was 
minimal and similar between ritlecitinib 200/50 mg and placebo groups.

In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the occurrence of adjudicated neurological events (i.e.. 
Meeting adjudication criteria for being a neurological event of interest), were 2.8% in the 200/50 
mg group, 1.5% in the 50/50 group, 2.3% in the 50 mg group, 4.6% in the 30 mg group, 6.5% in 
the 10 mg group and 4.2% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adjudicated events 
of interest (n ≥2 in any treatment group) were Paraesthesia and Dysesthesia, Headache, Syncope,

and Dizziness (not vertigo or presyncope). Paraesthesia and dysaesthesia occurred in 1.7% of the 
combined 50 mg group, 1.5% of the 30 mg group, not in the 10 mg group and in 0.9% of the 
placebo group. The occurrence was highest (1.9%) in the 200/50 mg group. Peripheral neuropathy 
occurred in 1 patient in the 30 mg group. The occurrence of adjudicated sensorineural hearing 
loss was: 0 patients of the 200/50 group, in 1 patient in the 50/50 mg group, 1 patient in the 30 
mg group, and 0 patients in both the 10 mg and placebo groups. 
In the Placebo-controlled AAV pool, there were 10 additional neurological events of interest 
meeting criteria for adjudication, as compared with the PCPAA pool. Of these, 3 were events of 
Paresthesia and dysesthesia in the 50 mg group. In the combined 50 mg group, there were 1.7% 
of patients with adjudicated paraesthesia/dysaesthesia, compared to 0.7% in the placebo group 
(Table 31). In the 30 mg group there were 1.3% of patients with paraesthesia/dysesthesia, but 
none in the 10 mg group. There were no additional adjudicated events of Peripheral neuropathy. 
Most dys-/hyper-/hypo-/paraesthesia’s were mild and resolved while being on study drug. Most 
events that were resolved did so within 2.5 – 8 weeks. 
Treatment-emergent tinnitus was most frequent in the 200/50 mg group (2.5%), less frequent in 
the 50/50 mg group (0.5%), and overall as frequent in the 50 mg group (1.5%) as in the placebo 
group (1.4%), (Table 31). Neurosensory deafness/hypoacusis (unadjudicated) occurred in 1-2 
cases in all treatment groups. 
Table 31: Occurrence of dysaesthesias and of audiological events in the Placebo-controlled AAV 
pool
In the one-year exposure pool of pivotal study 015, the occurrence of adjudicated paraesthesia/ 
dysaesthesia was infrequent, and higher in the 30 mg group (1.5%) as compared to the 50 mg 
(0.8%) and placebo (1.6%) groups (Table 32). Adjudicated sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 
more cases in the 50 mg group (1.1%) and 30 mg group (0.8%), as compared to the 10 mg 
group. Unadjudicated deafness was registered for 5 participants in the 50 mg group and 30 mg 
group each, not in the 10 mg group. Especially in the 50 mg and 30 mg group, there were 
additional unadjudicated cases of dysaesthesia/paraesthesia/hypoaesthesia. Most dys-/hyper-
/hypo-/paraesthesia’s were mild and resolved while being on study drug.

Table 32: Occurrence of dysaesthesias and of audiological events in the one-year exposure pool of 
study 015 
In the All-exposure pool, 75 (4.9%) participants in the 50 mg group had an event that met 
adjudication criteria for neurological safety. Paraesthesia and dysaesthesia was the most commonly 
adjudicated events of interest, reported in 24 (1.6%) participants in the 50 mg group and in 29 
(1.8%) on Any Ritlecitinib dose. The IR/100 PY (95% CI) for Paraesthesia and dysaesthesia in the 
50 mg group was 1.28 (0.84 – 1.89). Peripheral neuropathy was reported in 3 (0.2%) participants 
in the 50 mg group and 4 (0.2%) in the Any Ritlecitinib group. The IR/100 PY (95% CI) for 
Peripheral neuropathy in the 50 mg group was 0.16 (0.03 – 0.45). According to the listings, 
several cases occurred with paraesthesia/dysaesthesia/hypoaesthesia that was considered related, 
for whom the dysaesthesia was not resolved, or that did resolve, and the drug was withdrawn. 
There were 15 (1.0%) participants with TEAEs adjudicated to meet the criteria for adjudicated 
Sensorineural hearing loss in the 50 mg group, with an IR (95%CI) of 0.85/100 PY (0.49 – 1.39); 
there were 18 participants with sensorineural hearing loss in the any dose of ritlecitinib group. For 
comparison, in the AA subcohort in US study B7981051, the IR (95%CI) was 2.72 (2.4 – 3.09), 
and in the AA subcohort in Danish Study s7981049, the IR (95%CI) was 0.32 (0.24 – 0.41). 
In the 50 mg group, the IR/100 PY (95% CI) in participants ≥65 years old (n=30) was 8.50 (2,15 
– 23.1), which was higher than in participants ≥18 years old (n=1349) with 0.98 (0.57 – 1.59). No 
adolescent participant had an adjudicated event of Sensorineural hearing loss. 
Of the 18 patients in the Any Ritlecitinib dose group with sensorineural hearing loss, in 13/18 
cases, the hearing loss was considered related. In 7/18 cases, the hearing loss was related and 
was resolved; in 6/18 cases, the hearing loss was considered related and not resolved.

MACE 
In the ritlecitinib Phase 2/3 development programme, CV events were adjudicated by a blinded 
external adjudication committee. MACE was defined as a composite of death from cardiovascular 
causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. 
No treatment-emergent AEs of MACE (fatal or non-fatal) were reported in the placebo-controlled 
AA pool, in the placebo-controlled vitiligo trial, or in the one-year follow-up of the pivotal AA 
trial.  
In the All-exposure pool, there were 3 SAEs in the All 50 mg group with an IR/100 PY (95% CI) 
of 0.15 (0.03 – 0.43) with events adjudicated as a MACE event: 1 acute myocardial infarction, 1 
ischaemic stroke (retinal artery occlusion), and 1 sudden cardiac death (acute respiratory failure 
and cardio-respiratory arrest). The IR/100 PY (95% CI) for 2 events of non-fatal MACE was 0.09 
(0.01 – 0.30), and for 1 fatal MACE, it was 0.05 (0.00 – 0.23).  
The IR/100 PY (95% CI) of MACE in the All-exposure 50 mg group of 0.15 (0.03 – 0.43) was lower 
than reported in the TS AA sub cohorts in US study B7981051 with 1.2 (0.99 – 1.45) and the 
Danish study B7981049 with 0.58 (0.44 – 0.74). 
Venous Thromboembolic Events 
Adjudicated venous thromboembolic events (VTE) included pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT). 
There was 1 participant in the All-exposure pool who had an SAE which met adjudication criteria 
for PE; IR/100 PY (95% CI) of 0.06 (0.00 – 0.29). There were no cases of DVT in the data. The 
patient was treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg and had an SAE of PE of moderate severity on study 
Day 169. Potential risk factors included morbid obesity, sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease 
(hypertension, hyperlipidemia). The event was considered not related to study treatment by the 
investigator but related by the sponsor. The participant was discontinued from the study as a result 
of the event; outcome of the event was resolved. 
Serious infections 
Serious infections were defined as SAEs in the Infections and Infestation SOC. This included 
infections that required parenteral antimicrobial therapy or required hospitalisation for treatment or 
met other criteria that required the infection to be reported as an SAE. All serious infections 
required discontinuation from the study, as per protocol. 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the proportion of participants with serious infections was 
≤0.9% in ritlecitinib treatment groups (200/50 mg, 0.9%; All 50 mg, 0.6%; All 30 mg, 0.4%), 
with no events in 50/50 mg, 10 mg or placebo groups (Table 33). In the 200/50 mg group there 
were 2 participants with in total 3 serious infections: appendicitis, empyema, and sepsis. In the 30 
mg group, there was 1 participant with a serious infection: diverticulitis. In the placebo-
controlled Vitiligo study, no serious infections occurred. 
In the one-year follow-up data of the pivotal AA trial, in addition to the 3 serious infections in 
the 0–24-week data, one serious infection occurred in a participant on 30 mg: appendicitis. Time to 
onset of serious infections varied: 2 participants experienced serious infections (empyema and 
sepsis, and diverticulosis) that occurred on study day 50 and 56, respectively; 2 events of 
appendicitis occurred on study day 173 and study Day 240. All events resolved. The overall 
occurrence of serious infections in the 50 mg group was 0.8% with an IR (95%CI) of 0.86 (0.14 – 
2.85). 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023

In the All-exposure pool, there were 14 participants on 50 mg ritlecitinib who had at least one 
serious infection. The proportion and IR/100 PY (95% CI) of participants experiencing serious 
infections in the All 50 mg group were: 0.8% and 0.66 (0.35 – 1.14); and in the Any Ritlecitinib 
group these were 0.9% and 0.64 (0.36 – 1.05). The most frequently occurring serious infections 
on 50 mg were appendicitis (n=4) and coronavirus infections (n=4), (Table 33). 
The IR/100 PY (95% CI) of serious infection in the All exposure pool All 50 mg group of 0.66 (0.35 
– 1.14) was lower than reported in the AA subcohorts in the observational US Study B7981051 of 
1.15 (0.95 – 1.39) and the Danish observational study B7981049 of 1.8 (1.61 – 2). 
No participant who experienced a serious infection had an ALC <LLN at baseline or prior to the 
event.

Herpes Zoster (HZ) 
This section describes all events of HZ, regardless of whether they were reviewed and confirmed as 
an opportunistic infection (if it was multi-dermatomal HZ (nonadjacent or >2 adjacent 
dermatomes) or disseminated HZ.

In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the proportion of participants with HZ was ≤1.5% in 
ritlecitinib (50/50 mg, 1.5%; All 50 mg, 0.9 %; All 30 mg, 0.8%) and no HZ events were reported 
in placebo. All HZ events were non-serious, mild, or moderate, and all resolved; 1 participant (All 
30 mg) had HZ resulting in temporary discontinuation from the study drug. 
In the one-year follow-up data, the proportion and IR/100 PY of participants with HZ increased 
with increasing dose across the All 50 mg group with 2.3% and IR (95%CI) of 2.61 (1.06 – 5.44), 
compared with All 30 mg with 0.8% and an IR of 0.88 (0.15 – 2.92) and 10 mg with 0.0% and an 
IR of 0 (0.00 - 5.42). There was no participant with an event of HZ adjudicated as an OI. All events 
were mild or moderate, resolved or resolving, and non-serious, 3 participants with HZ were 
temporarily discontinued from the study drug. The IR/100 PY (95% CI) in the All 50 mg group of 
the OYEP was 2.61 (1.06 – 5.44), which was higher than in the All 50 mg group in the PCPAA with 
1.86 (0.47 – 5.14). 
Malignancy (excluding NMSC) 
Malignancy events were adjudicated by a blinded external adjudication committee consisting of 
experts in their field. In addition, a Histopathology Review Committee that included a central 
laboratory pathologist review of biopsies also assisted in the evaluation of potential malignancies. 
NMSC events are discussed separately from other malignancies. 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, 1 participant (0.5%) in the 200/50 mg group had an 
adjudicated malignancy of lobular carcinoma of the breast. In the placebo-controlled Vitiligo 
trial, no cases of malignancies (excluding NMSC) occurred. 
In the one-year follow-up period of the pivotal AA trial, 2 (0.8%) participants in All 50 mg 
experienced malignancies (excluding NMSC) compared with no participant in the 30 mg or 10 mg 
groups. In both participants, the events were SAEs of breast cancer (invasive lobular breast 
carcinoma, breast cancer). 
In the all-exposure pool, there were 7 participants with adjudicated malignancies (excluding 
NMSC), all in the 50 mg group (N=1521). The proportion and IR/100 PY (95% CI) in the 50 mg 
group was 0.5% and 0.37 (0.16 – 0.75) and in the Any Ritlecitinib group this was 0.4% and 0.32 
(0.14 – 0.63). The adjudicated malignancies were lobular breast carcinoma (n=1), breast cancer 
(n=3), testis cancer (n=1) and papillary thyroid cancer (n=1). One additional adjudicated event of 
malignant melanoma was reported after the 35-day reporting period. Three of the 8 events were 
considered related by the investigator. 
The IR/100 PY (95% CI) for malignancy (excluding NMSC) in the 50 mg group of 0.37 (0.16 – 
0.75) was lower than reported for the AA subcohorts in US study B7981051 of 1.0 (0.82 – 1.23) 
and lower as compared with the IR of 0.56 (0.46 – 0.68) in the Danish study B7981049.  
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there were no occurrences of NMSC (basal cell carcinoma or 
squamous cell carcinoma). In the placebo-controlled Vitiligo trial, there were 2 participants 
with NMSC; 1 participant in the 200/50 mg group experienced SCC, a participant in the 100/50 mg 
group experienced BCC. In the All 50 mg group, there thus were 2 cases (0.4% of NMSC). 
In the one-year follow-up period of the pivotal AA trial, there were no occurrences of NMSC 
(basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma). 
In the all exposure pool, there were 5 (0.3%) participants with NMSC, all in the All 50 mg group 
(N=1521) with an IR (95%CI) of 0.26/100 PY (0.09 – 0.59). This included 3 (0.2%) events of BCC, 
1 (0.1%) event of SCC, and 1 (0.1%) event of Bowen’s disease. One event of BCC was severe and 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 156/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported as a SAE, resulting in the interruption of study treatment; the outcome was resolved. Four 
of the 5 events were considered as unrelated, for one, the assessment is unknown. 
In the All 50 mg in the all-exposure pool, the IR/100 PY (95% CI) for BCC and SCC was 0.16 (0.03 
– 0.45) and 0.06 (0.00 – 0.29), respectively, and comparable or lower than those reported in 
patients ≥18 years in US study B7981051 with an IR (95%CI) for BCC of 0.63 (0.49 – 0.83] and 
for SCC of 0.42 (0.3 – 0.58) and comparable to the Danish study B7981049 with 0.13 (0.08 – 
0.19) and for SCC 0.02 (0.01 – 0.06). The overall BCC:SCC ratio of 3:2 is within expected range 
for the general population and differs from the ratio expected in an immunosuppressed population. 
2.6.8.5.  Laboratory findings 
Treatment with ritlecitinib was associated with changes in haematological parameters and lipids, 
some of which were larger with increasing doses. Decreases in haemoglobin, lymphocytes, and 
lymphocyte subsets were larger in the first 4 weeks in the 200/50 mg compared with 50/50 mg. 
Haematological parameters and lipids remained stable during long-term treatment. There were no 
clinically meaningful trends for hepatic laboratory parameters. There were no Hy’s Law cases. 
Lymphocytes 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there was a median decrease from baseline in absolute ALC 
in all ritlecitinib groups compared with placebo up to Week 4, which was more apparent in 200/50 
mg, All 50 mg, and All 30 mg. At Week 24, the median ALC in all groups reached a plateau that 
was lower than the baseline value (Figure 28). 
In the 50/50 mg group, there were no events of lymphocyte count decreased considered CTCAE 
Grade 3 (<500 to 200/mm3) or Grade 4 (<200/mm3). However, 6 participants (4 [1.9%] in 200/50 
mg [same participants in All 50 mg, 1.2%] and 2 [0.8%] in All 30 mg) had lymphocyte count 
decreased considered CTCAE Grade 3, and 1 [0.5%] participant (200/50 mg [had lymphocyte 
count decreased considered CTCAE Grade 4. No participant was permanently discontinued from the 
study or study drug or temporarily discontinued from study drug due to a TEAE of lymphopenia. 
In the one-year exposure pool, the lower lymphocyte counts remained on the lower level. TEAEs 
of lymphopenia were reported for 7 participants (2 [0.8%] in All 50 mg, 4 [1.5%] in All 30 mg, and 
1 [1.6%] in 10 mg). TEAEs of lymphocyte count decreased were reported for 6 participants (All 50 
mg [2, 0.8%], All 30 mg [4, 1.5%]). A TEAE of lymphocyte count abnormal was reported for 1 
(0.4%) participant (All 50 mg).

Platelet counts 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there was a median decrease from BL at Week 2 in all 
ritlecitinib groups, which remained stable at the lower level up to Week 24; changes were similar 
across ritlecitinib groups. No participant had platelet counts considered CTCAE Grade 3 (<50 to 25 
× 103/mm3) or Grade 4 (<25 × 103/mm3). A TEAE of thrombocytopenia was reported for 1 (1.6%) 
participant (10 mg). TEAEs of platelet count decreased were reported for 5 participants (1 [0.8%] 
in 50/50 mg [same participant 1 (0.3%) in All 50 mg] and 4 [1.5%] in All 30 mg). 1 (0.4%) 
participant (All 30 mg) was permanently discontinued from study or study drug and 1 (0.4%) 
participant (All 30 mg) temporarily discontinued study drug due to a TEAE of platelet count 
decreased. 
In the one-year follow-up data, the median decrease in the ritlecitinib groups remained stable up 
to week 48. TEAEs of thrombocytopenia were reported for 2 participants (1 [0.4%] in All 30 mg 
and 1 [1.6%] in 10 mg). TEAEs of platelet count decreased were reported for 6 participants (2 
[0.8%] in All 50 mg; 4 [1.5%] in All 30 mg). 1 [0.4%] participant in All 30 mg was permanently 
discontinued from study or study drug and no participant temporarily discontinued from study drug 
due to a TEAE of thrombocytopenia. 
Lipids 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there were small increases from BL at Week 4 in median TC, 
HDL-C, and LDL-C and variable changes in TG relative to placebo. Up to Week 24, levels of HDL-C 
were similar to placebo across all ritlecitinib groups; there were small increases in median CFB in 
TC, LDL-C, and TG in ritlecitinib groups compared with placebo. 
TEAEs of hyperlipidaemia were reported for 2 participants (1 each: All 30 mg [0.4%], 10 mg 
[1.6%]). No participant was permanently discontinued from study or study drug due or temporarily 
discontinued study drug to hyperlipidaemia. 
In the one-year follow up data, the changes in lipids were variable and small as compared to 
baseline. TEAEs of hyperlipidaemia were reported for 3 participants (2 [0.8%] in All 30 mg and 1

[1.6%] in 10 mg). No participant was permanently or temporarily discontinued from study or study 
drug due to hyperlipidaemia. 
Creatine phosphokinase 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, baseline median values (U/L) for CK (range: 88.0-101.0) 
were comparable between ritlecitinib and placebo. Median change from baseline to the Week 24 
was 8.0 in in 50/50 mg and 0.5 in placebo. The proportion of participants with CK increases 
considered CTCAE Grade 3 (>5× ULN to 10× ULN) or Grade 4 (>10× ULN) was similar across the 
ritlecitinib groups, but higher than placebo in 200/50 mg, 50/50 mg, All 50 mg, All 30 mg, and 10 
mg. Five (3.9%) participants in 50/50 mg and 2 (0.9%) participants in placebo had CK increases 
considered CTCAE Grade 3 or 4. 5 participants (200/50 mg, 2 [0.9%]; 50/50 mg, 1 [0.8%]; [same 
participants in All 50 mg (0.9%)]; 30 mg, 1 [0.4%], 10 mg, 1 [1.6%]) temporarily discontinued 
study drug due to TEAEs of blood CK increased. No events of rhabdomyolysis were reported. 
In the one-year follow up data, there was no clinically meaningful change over time in CK levels 
in ritlecitinib groups. The proportion of participants with CK increases considered CTCAE Grade 3 
was higher in All 50 mg compared with All 30 mg and 10 mg. The proportion of participants with 
CK increases considered CTCAE Grade 4 was higher in All 50 mg and All 30 mg compared with 10 
mg. 14 participants had CK increases considered CTCAE Grade 3: 11 (4.3% [All 50 mg]), 2 (0.8% 
[All 30 mg]), and 1 (1.6% [10 mg]). 15 participants had CK increases considered CTCAE Grade 4: 
6 (2.3% [All 50 mg]), 8 (3.1% [All 30 mg]), and 1 (1.6% [10 mg]). No events of rhabdomyolysis 
were reported. 
Liver enzymes 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, baseline values (U/L) for AST (median range: 19.0-19.5) and 
ALT (median range: 15.0-17.0) were comparable between ritlecitinib and placebo groups. There 
was no meaningful change over time: median change from baseline (U/L) to the Week 24 in 50/50 
mg (AST: 0; ALT: 1) and placebo (AST: -1; ALT: 0). TEAEs of hyperbilirubinaemia were reported 
for 1 (1.6%) participant (10 mg) and liver function test increased for 3 (1.4%) participants 
(200/50 mg [same participants in All 50 mg, 0.9%]), 1 (0.6%) participant on 200/50 mg 
temporarily discontinued study drug due to liver function test increased; there were no potential 
Hy’s Law cases. 
In the one-year follow up data, there were some cases with raised hepatic enzymes above 2 
time the ULN or more, especially in the higher dose groups. In the 50 mg ritlecitinib group: 1 TEAE 
of liver function increased, 2 TEAE of Transaminases increased, 2 TEAE of ALT increased, 1 TEAE of 
AST increased, 2 TEAE of bilirubin increased (1 moderate TEAE as well as 1 TEAE not recovered). 
In the 30 mg ritlecitinib group: 1 TEAE of Transaminases increased, 4 TEAE of ALT increased, 2 
TEAE of AST increased, 1 TEAE of bilirubin increased (1 severe TEAE and all events recovered). In 
the 10 mg ritlecitinib group: 1 TEAE of Hepatic enzymes increased and 1 TEAE of 
Hyperbilirubinemia. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Elderly patients 
The number of patients of 65 years and older was limited. In the All-exposure pool, there were 33 
(2.0%) elderly participants, of which there were 30 (2.0%) elderly participants on the 50 mg dose.  
The proportion of elderly participants experiencing TEAEs (all causality and treatment-related) was 
similar to adults (≥18 years) across the ritlecitinib groups (Table 34). The proportion of elderly 
participants experiencing severe AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to permanent discontinuations was 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 159/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher than adults. The proportion of elderly participants experiencing AEs leading to temporary 
discontinuations was similar to the overall adult population. 
In the 50 mg group of the All-exposure cohort, compared with adults, additional frequent TEAEs (≥
10% and higher than adults) in elderly participants included urinary tract infections (elderly 
16.7%; adults 5.3%), lymphocyte count decreased (elderly 10.0%; adults 1.3%), and arthralgia 
(elderly 13.3%; adults 3.4%). Five (16.7%) elderly participants experienced SAEs: COVID-19, 
thermal burn, BCC, breast cancer, and aortic aneurysm (1 participant each). There were no events 
adjudicated as OI, TB, MACE, or ATE. 
The proportion and IR/100 PY (95% CI) of elderly participants experiencing serious infection and 
HZ was higher than in adults. One (3.3%; IR 2.11 [0.10, 11.52]) elderly participant experienced 
serious infection and 3 (10.0%, 8.23 [2.09, 22.41]) experienced HZ, compared with 10 (0.7%; 
0.64 [0.32, 1.16]) for serious infections and 21 (1.6%, 1.34 (0.85, 2.03] for HZ in the adult 
population. 
There was 1 (3.3%; IR 2.58/100 PY [95% CI: 0.13, 12.79]) elderly participant experienced 
adjudicated malignancies (excluding NMSC) and 2 (6.7%; IR 4.81/100 PY [95% CI: 0.79, 16.41]) 
experienced NMSC (BCC). No elderly participant experienced SCC. The proportion and IR of elderly 
participants experiencing malignancies (excluding NMSC), NMSC, and BCC were higher in the 
elderly than adults in both All 50 mg and Any Ritlecitinib. 
There were 3 (10.0%; IR 7.63/100 PY [95% CI: 1.92, 21.16]) elderly participants in All 50 mg with 
an event of an adjudicated event of Disorders of integrative motor functions (excluding CN 
and peripheral neuropathies) (2 events of sciatica, 1 of peroneal nerve palsy). 
There were 3 (10.0%) elderly participants in All 50 mg who experienced sensorineural hearing 
loss (1 event each of deafness, deafness unilateral/neurosensory, and hypoacusis). The proportion 
and IR/100 PY (95% CI) of adjudicated audiological events of interest of sensorineural hearing loss 
was higher in elderly participants (10%, 8.50 [2.15, 23.14]) than in adults (1.1%, 0.98 [0.57, 
1.59]). 
Table 34: Summary of TEAEs by baseline age in the All-exposure cohort 
Females and males 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the proportion of patients with at least one TEAE in the 
combined 50 mg group was 62% for males and 78% for females. The proportions of patients with 
SAEs was similar, but more females (11%) than males (6.1%) temporarily discontinued 
medication. 
In the all-exposure pool on 50 mg, the proportion of participants experiencing TEAEs (all 
causality or treatment-related) was higher in females (80.0% and 36.7%, respectively) than males 
(72.9% and 31.0%, respectively). SAEs were more frequently experienced by female (4.2%) than

male (1.9%) participants. The proportion of participants experiencing severe AEs, or AEs leading to 
permanent or temporary discontinuation was similar in males and females. A higher proportion and 
IR/100PY (95% CI) of females of 3.3% had HZ compared with males with 0.9%. A higher 
proportion of females of 2.0% [3 participants] experienced sensorineural hearing loss compared 
with males (no events reported). In All 30 mg and 10 mg, the proportion of sensorineural hearing 
loss in males and females was similar. 
Adolescents 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there were n=105 (15%) adolescents included, with n=18 in 
the 50/50 mg group and n=20 in the 200/50 mg group, and n=19 on placebo (Table 35). In the 
combined 50 mg group (n=38), the proportion of adolescents with at least 1 TEAE was 79% (71% 
in adults), SAEs did not occur (1.3% in adults), there were 2.6% (2.3% in adults) adolescents who 
permanently discontinued study drug due to an AE, and 7.9% of adolescents temporary 
discontinued (9.4% in adults) due to an AE. 
Table 35: Overview of adverse events for adolescents and adults in the PCPAA pool 
TEAEs reported by the largest number of adolescents (≥10% of participants) and at a frequency 
higher than in placebo included nasopharyngitis (All 50 mg 13.2%, placebo 0%) and acne (All 50 
mg 13.2%, placebo 5.3%), with no increase in frequency with increasing dose. In adults, the 
proportion of participants with acne (All 50 mg 4.9%, Placebo 4.6%) and nasopharyngitis (All 50 
mg 9.4%, Placebo 7.7%) were similar to placebo. Infections and infestations (SOC) were more 
frequent on 50 mg as compared to placebo in adolescents (All 50 mg 42%, placebo 20%) as well 
as adults (All 50 mg 38%, placebo 32%). Upper respiratory tract infections and urinary tract 
infections did not occur in adolescents on ritlecitinib.  
No adolescent in the combined 50 mg group had an SAE; there were two adolescents in the 10 mg 
group who had an SAE (suicidal behaviour, eczema). 
There were no reports of serious infections, HZ, TB, NMSC, BCC, SCC, MACE, thromboembolic 
events, or ATE in adolescents. There were no events adjudicated as neurologic or audiologic event 
of interest in adolescents. Also, tinnitus, par-/dys-/hypoaesthesia, did not occur in adolescents on 
ritlecitinib. 
In the one-year exposure pool of the pivotal AA trial, the proportions of participants with at least 
1 TEAE increased with dose, in adults as well as in adolescents. The proportion of adolescents with 
at least 1 TEAE in the 50 mg group was 82% (84% in adults), SAEs did not occur on 50 mg 
(2.7%% in adults), there were 2.6% (3.1% in adults) adolescents who permanently discontinued 
study drug due to an AE, and 13.2% of adolescents temporary discontinued (14.3% in adults) due 
to an AE.  
Compared to the placebo-controlled period, there was one additional adolescent with a SAE, of 
appendicitis in the 30 mg group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023

In adolescents, there were no reports of adjudicated HZ, TB, OI, NMSC, BCC, SCC, MACE, 
thromboembolic events or ATE. There were no adjudicated audiologic events of interest in 
adolescents, and no events of tinnitus, par-/dys-/hypoaesthesia. 
In the All exposure pool, there were 172 adolescents included. The proportion of adolescents in 
the 50 mg group with at least 1 TEAE was 76% (76% in 18 < 50 years old), there were 2.3% with 
an SAE (4.7% in 18<50 yrs), while 4.1% and 15.7% permanently or temporary discontinued 
ritlecitinib due to AEs (4.6% and 18% in 18 < 50 yrs). The IR/100 PY (95% CI) of SAEs in the 50 
mg group was 1.73 (0.54 – 4.23) in adolescents and 2.86 (2.11 – 3.80) in adults. In the 
adolescents on 50 mg and as compared with adults, TEAEs frequently experienced in adolescents (
≥5% and >5% higher than adults) included nausea (adolescents 8.1%, adults 3.1%) and acne 
(adolescents 17.4%, adults 7.0%).  
There were no reports of HZ, HS, or adjudicated events of OI, TB, MACE, malignancy, ATE, or 
audiologic events of interest in adolescents. In the 50 mg group, 2 (1.2%) with an IR (95%CI) of 
0.81 (0.13 – 2.79) adolescents had at least one serious infection (appendicitis, COVID 19 
pneumonia, septic shock), compared with 10 (0.7%) with an IR (95%CI) of 0.64 (0.32 – 1.16) in 
adults. 
In the 50 mg group, in adolescents, there was 1 case of unilateral deafness (2 cases or 0.1% in 
adults), 1 case of hypoacusis (10 cases or 0.7%) in adults), 1 case of tinnitus (34 cases or 2.5% in 
adults), and 1 adjudicated event of Paresthesia and dysesthesia (21 cases or 1.6% in adults). 
In the ritlecitinib clinical trials which enrolled adolescents (015 and 032), the height SDS (SD 
standardised to the US population by age and gender) was calculated at each time point where 
height and weight measurement was available. As such, the findings were normalised across age 
and gender. At Month 6 and Month 12, the Height SDS changes in All 50 mg ranged from -1.1 to 
2.2 with mean and median SDS close to 0, suggesting no meaningful change in the participants’ 
growth curves (Table 36).

Page 162/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 36: Standardised deviation score (SDS) for height and change from baseline for adolescents 
in studies 015 and 032 
Similarly, the summary of weight SDS did not identify any meaningful change in weight. Weight 
SDS changes at Month 6 and Month 12 ranged from -4.0 to 1.7, with median of 0 at Month 6 and 
Month 12. In AEP, 2 (1.2%) adolescents in All 50 mg had an AE of weight increased. 
AEs associated with fractures were identified using a CMQ. There were 4 (2.2%) adolescents with 
a fracture in the All-Exposure Pool on Any Ritlecitinib treatment. The IR/100 PY (95% CI) for 
fracture was 1.35 (0.43 – 3.33) which is within the range for the general adolescent population 
(1.33/100 PY). The cases were: a hand fracture (metacarpal fracture) attributed to an accident; a 
tibia fracture (minimally left tibial plateau fracture) attributed to an injury playing basketball; a 
clavicle fracture (right collar bone) related to injury and a radius fracture (right closed fracture, 
distal radius, intra-articular) being related to injury while playing basketball; a hand fracture 
(fractured right pinky finger) attributed to a weightlifting injury.  
In the All-exposure pool, there were no events related to growth disturbance (PTs of growth 
disorder, growth failure, growth retardation, body height below normal, body height abnormal, 
body height decreased). 
Tanner staging documents the development of secondary sexual characteristics in children and 
adolescents. The changes from baseline in Tanner stage assessments at Month 12 and Month 24 by 
age for participants <18 years old in study 032 indicated a progression of puberty among 
adolescents from Baseline to Month 12. There are too few participants at Month 24 to make any 
meaningful observations.

Pregnancy and lactation 
The applicant claimed that there was no risk for genotoxicity at ritlecitinib doses relevant to human 
exposure in non-clinical studies; mainly based on the safety margins related to the unbound AUC 
at the chronic human dose of 50 mg (also see non-clinical AR).  
Based on the non-clinical data, women of childbearing potential were required to use effective 
contraception in the clinical programme. While there are no substantial data on the use of 
ritlecitinib in pregnancy, as of 28 February 2022, there have been 21 cases of exposure during 
pregnancy reported in participants exposed to ritlecitinib: 12 maternal exposures and 9 partner 
exposures. Among the maternal cases in ritlecitinib treated participants, there was a live birth in 1 
participant, spontaneous abortion in 4 participants, elective abortion in 6 participants, and 1 
participant with unknown outcomes. Outcomes of the partner exposures were live births in 5 
participants, elective abortion in 1 participant, and 3 participants with unknown outcomes.  
There are no data on the presence of ritlecitinib in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, 
or effects on milk production. According to the applicant, a risk to newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded and ritlecitinib should not be used during breast-feeding. 
In the non-clinical studies, the applicant claims that ritlecitinib had no effects on female rat fertility 
at exposures up to 55× the unbound AUC at the chronic human dose of 50 mg.  
According to the applicant, women of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment with ritlecitinib and for at least 1 month after the last dose. It is 
also recommended to consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive 
potential. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant considers that there is no clinically relevant potential for other medicines to affect the 
PK of ritlecitinib; and that there is a reason for caution as ritlecitinib has some potential to affect 
the PK of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP1A2 substrates, OCT1 substrates where small concentration 
changes may lead to serious adverse events. This information has been reflected in the product 
information.  
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Permanent discontinuation 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the proportions of patients who permanently discontinued 
treatment with the study medication due to AEs were roughly similar across treatment groups. In 
the combined 50 mg group, 2.3% of patients had discontinued; in the placebo group, this was 
similar with 2.3%; the highest proportions occurred in the 200/50 mg (2.8%) and 10 mg (3.2%) 
groups. Urticaria was the commonest reason for permanent discontinuation. 
In the one-year follow-up pool, the proportions of patients who permanently discontinued 
treatment were similar across dose groups (50 mg, 30 mg, 10 mg). 
In the all-exposure pool, pregnancy, urticaria and rash, and deviations in laboratory values (CPK 
increased, ALC decreased, ALAT increased, AST increased) were common reasons for permanent 
discontinuation, but there also were serious AEs such as breast cancer and acute respiratory failure 
and pneumonia.

Temporary discontinuation 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the proportions of patients who temporary discontinued 
treatment with the study medication due to AEs was highest in the patients treated with 50 mg 
(9.3%) and lowest in the placebo group (3.8%). The commonest AEs were diarrhoea, vomiting, 
gastroenteritis, headache and urticaria; but were also Covid-19 related. 
In the one-year follow up pool, the proportions of patients who permanently discontinued 
treatment were highest in the 50 mg group and lowest in the 10 mg group. 
In the all-exposure pool, the commonest reasons for temporary discontinuation were: SARS-
CoV-2 test positive, headache, pyrexia, cough, urticaria, vomiting and nausea, blood CPK 
increased, but also infections like latent tuberculosis and upper respiratory tract infections or 
herpes zoster. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Litfulo (ritlecitinib) is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits JAK3 and the TEC kinase 
family (BTK, BMX, ITK, TXK and TEC) by irreversibly binding to the conserved cysteine in the ATP 
binding site. The applicant claims that ritlecitinib showed high selectivity over the other three JAK 
isoforms, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, by more than 300-fold, and over the broader human kinome. 
Class effects 
In the recently concluded Article 20 referral on JAKis authorised in the treatment of chronic 
inflammatory disorders (EC decision issued on 10 March 2023), several serious AEs were 
considered as class effects of oral JAK inhibitors: MACE, VTE, malignancies and NMSC, serious 
infections, and overall mortality. It is not known in how far those class effects considered for 
approved JAKis apply to ritlecitinib, despite its selectivity for JAK3, the clinical PD effects and 
available clinical safety data. Long-term follow-up is currently limited, and thus class effects cannot 
be fully discarded. The inclusion of serious and opportunistic infections and malignancies in the 
warnings in the RMP is agreed upon, based on the inhibiting effect of ritlecitinib on the immune 
system. The exact mechanism by which JAK inhibition would lead to thromboembolic events is not 
known, although JAK2 has haematologic downstream effects (e.g. Liu et al. 2012; Zarrin et al. 
2021). Therefore, the inclusion of thromboembolic events as a warning in the SmPC and in the RMP 
is also endorsed due to the uncertainty stemming from effects found for other JAKis and the lack of 
long-term clinical safety data. Moreover, MACE was added in the context of thromboembolic 
adverse events, in line with the RMP’s of other JAK-inhibitors. Those adverse events are further 
discussed below under AESIs subsection.  
Design 
Two repeated chronic toxicity studies in dogs noted a species-specific finding of axonal dystrophy 
(swelling). In CHMP Scientific Advice, it was recommended to consider these events in the pivotal 
clinical study. The applicant performed audiological testing in pivotal study 015, long-term study 
032, and the dedicated safety study 037; nerve fibre measurements were performed in study 037. 
Potential neurologic and audiologic events of interest in both studies were adjudicated by a blinded 
external adjudication committee.  
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 165/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The design of the additional safety study on PD safety outcomes (BAEP and axonal dystrophy and 
swelling) is agreed. The sample size is, albeit small, large enough for PD outcomes, and it used a 
relevant dose (200/50 mg) and an adult population similar to the target population, although 
without pre-existing hearing loss or nerve disorders. This is agreed not to confound the study. 
The pooling of the studies to safety data pools is agreed upon, as it increases sample sizes and is 
based on the similarity of dose regimens, indications/underlying disorders, and data collection. 
Exposure 
The exposure in the phase 2/3 studies, exceeds the normal expectations of 100 participants (for 
both adolescents and adults) exposed for > 1 year and aligns with a number of 1000-1500 
participants to be exposed (ICH Guideline E1). It is endorsed that the data of patients treated with 
200/50 mg and with the proposed posology of 50/50 mg are generally pooled. However, the data 
set is considered too limited for infrequent serious AEs considered class effects of JAK inhibitors 
(MACE, VTE, malignancies, serious infections). Accordingly, these were included as important 
potential risks in the Safety Specification of the RMP. In addition, the database may be insufficient 
for the follow-up of probable long-term unfavourable effects on the (central) nervous system (see 
non-clinical discussion) and a warning on neurotoxicity was added. 
Generalisation to clinical practice 
The main exclusion criteria considered the type of AA and inadequate wash-out of therapies, and 
the discontinuation criteria were in line with the safety profile for JAKis in general. Therefore, it is 
considered that these criteria were not overly selective, which is supportive for generalisation to 
clinical practice.  
Ritlecitinib should be avoided in patients with an active, serious infection, and it should not be 
given to patients with active TB, as already indicated in the warnings. Opportunistic infections are 
an important potential risk based on the mechanism of action of ritlecitinib. Therefore, active 
tuberculosis and active serious infections were included as contra-indications in the section 4.3 of 
the SmPC. 
Patients with evidence of HIV infection or hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from studies with 
ritlecitinib. Screening for viral hepatitis was already recommended in the warnings. The warning 
also included that monitoring for reactivation of viral hepatitis is recommended.  
Pregnancy and lactation were included in the SmPC as contra-indications. This is further discussed 
below, under Safety in special populations.  
Discontinuations 
The proportions of patients who permanently discontinued due to AEs during the placebo-controlled 
phase were similar for the treatment groups and placebo; urticaria was a relatively common reason 
for permanent discontinuation. Pregnancy, urticaria and rash, and deviations in laboratory values 
(CPK increased, ALC decreased, ALAT increased, AST increased) were common reasons for 
permanent discontinuation in the all-exposure pool. However, there were also serious AEs such as 
breast cancer, acute respiratory failure and pneumonia. The proportion of patients who temporarily 
discontinued due to AEs during the placebo-controlled phase was highest for patients treated with 
50 mg. In the all-exposure pool, the commonest reason for temporary discontinuation was ‘SARS-
CoV-2 test positive’, otherwise the reasons for temporary discontinuations were a mixture of AEs 
with impactful symptoms (including pain and urticaria, vomiting and nausea, diarrhoea), deviations 
in laboratory values (blood CPK increased, aspartate increased, ALC decreased), and infections 
(including latent TB, upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster).  
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 166/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stopping rules in case of deviation of laboratory values and infection are appropriately reflected in 
the posology and the warnings sections of the SmPC.  
Adverse events 
The applicant initially proposed to include ‘herpes zoster’, ‘dizziness’, ‘diarrhoea’, ‘acne’, ‘urticaria’, 
‘rash’, ‘blood CPK increased’, ‘platelet count decreased’, and ‘lymphocyte count decreased’, as ADR 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Based on the differences in the placebo-controlled AA pool between the 
50/50 mg and the combined 50 mg (200/50 mg and 50/50 mg) groups with the placebo group, the 
inclusion of those ADRs is agreed.  
Based on the PCPAA and the OYEP data and supported by the modelled dose-response relationship, 
‘upper respiratory tract infections’ were considered as ADRs for inclusion in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. ‘Folliculitis’ had been included as an ADR as well and this is agreed upon. Infections were 
more frequent in the 50 mg group compared to placebo, and the occurrence of overall infection 
appeared to be dose-related in the placebo-controlled and one-year follow-up data. In the PCPAA 
pool, infections and infestations (SOC) occurred in 38% of patients in the combined 50 mg group, 
37% in the 30 mg group, 32% in the 10 mg group and 31% of the placebo group; this proportion 
was higher in the 200/50 mg group (41%) as compared to the 50/50 mg group (33%). In the 
OYEP data, infections and infestations (SOC) were more frequent in the 50 mg group (51%), as 
compared to the 30 mg (47%) and the 10 mg (40%) groups. In the PCPAA pool, several infections 
at the PT level were more frequent in the combined 50 mg dose group as compared to placebo: 
folliculitis (4.6% versus 1.9%), gastroenteritis (1.4% versus 0), nasopharyngitis (9.9% versus 
7.0%) and upper respiratory tract infections (8.4% versus 7.5%). These infections did not show a 
clear dose-response relationship in the PCPAA data. However, in the OYEP data (50 mg versus 30 
mg versus 10 mg), folliculitis (7.3% versus 6.1% versus 6.5%), nasopharyngitis (14.2% versus 
16.1% versus 9.7%) and upper respiratory tract infections (11.1% versus 10.7% versus 3.2%) 
were more frequent in the higher dose groups; such a dose-response relation was not apparent for 
gastroenteritis (1.5% versus 1.9% versus 3.2%). In the OYEP data, urinary tract infections were 
more frequent in the highest dose groups (4.6% and 3.1% versus 0). According to the dose-
response analysis performed by the applicant, there was a small but statistically significant dose-
response effect. Over the range of relevant doses, an approximately 10-fold increase in ritlecitinib 
exposure, with a geometric mean Cav of 27 ng/mL for 30 mg QD as compared to 257 ng/mL for 
200 mg QD, was predicted to lead to a 3-fold increase in the mean incidence of infections per 100 
patient-years (11.0 versus 33.2, respectively). Although SARS-CoV-2 test positive was more 
frequent in the 50 mg group, Covid-19 was not, and the frequencies were low. Also, considering 
the nature of the pandemic, it is considered that these events are quite appropriately covered 
within the discussion of infections in general.  
Pyrexia was more frequent in the combined 50 mg group (2.3%) as compared to placebo (0); the 
occurrence was highest in the 50/50 mg group (3.1%), but pyrexia also occurred in the 200/50 mg 
(1.9%), 30 mg (1.1%) and 10 mg (1.6%) groups. Also, in the OYEP data, pyrexia was more 
frequent in the highest dose group. It, however, appeared that pyrexia was not an event ‘on its 
own’ but was explained by underlying causes, notably infection. Therefore. it is not included as an 
ADR. 
Headache, upper abdominal pain, and back pain were numerically more common in the 50 mg 
dose groups than in the placebo group. Based on the relatively small difference in occurrence 
between the combined 50 mg group and placebo, and the lack of a dose-response relationship in 
the placebo-controlled and one-year follow-up data, it is concluded that headache, upper 
abdominal pain, and back pain are not considered as ADR.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAEs and deaths were infrequent in the AA studies, though it must also be considered that the 
study population was young: 85% of the patients were <50 years of age and the mean (SD) age 
was 34 (14) years.  
In the 200/50 mg group, there were 5 SAEs, while there were none in the 50 mg group. This 
supports the choice of 50 mg as the recommended dose instead of 200/50 mg, also given the 
nature of the SAEs that were infectious (n=3) or malignant (n=1). Most SAEs were infections or 
infestations, followed by neoplasms in the 50 mg All Exposure pool. In the All-Exposure Pool, there 
were 2 deaths, and one death in the clinical study programme for Ulcerative Colitis. The deaths 
were due to breast cancer, acute respiratory failure/cardio-respiratory arrest, and severe 
myocardial infarction. The period of exposure was relatively short for two of the deaths, making an 
important causal role for ritlecitinib unlikely. 
The occurrence of infections and malignancies are in line with the mode of action of ritlecitinib. 
When combining all exposures to 50 mg ritlecitinib in the All 50 mg group, the ‘Infections and 
Infestations’ SOC included the highest proportion (n=12, 0.8%) of participants with SAEs, followed 
by ‘Neoplasms’ (n=9, 0.6%); there were 2 cases of ‘Cardiac disorders’ (acute myocardial infarction 
and cardio-respiratory arrest), and 1 case of pulmonary embolism.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Following the non-clinical finding in dogs of axonal dystrophy, the applicant has implemented 
regular audiometry assessments in the phase2/3 studies in AA, had eligible audiological AEs and 
nervous system AEs adjudicated by an independent committee of experts in neurology and 
audiometry, and performed a placebo-controlled PD safety study (037) with audiological (BAEPs) 
and nervous system (IENF density and axonal swelling in skin punch biopsies) outcomes. The 
measures taken in the clinical study programme to detect nervous system and audiological adverse 
events are acknowledged. 
The non-clinical finding in dogs of axonal dystrophy was found in the peripheral nervous system 
and at exposures ≥14 x the proposed human dose of 50 mg, and functional effects on hearing, 
tested using BAEP, were found at exposures ≥33 x the proposed human dose (see non-clinical 
discussion). From a clinical perspective, it is considered that the safety margins for axonal 
dystrophy are relatively low (7x to 14x), although the safety margin for apparently reversible, 
adverse hearing effects is much larger (33x).  
The PD safety outcomes of study 037 did not show differences between the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg 
(n=36) group and the placebo group (n=35) over 9 months. This is reassuring in the short term. 
The occurrence of (adjudicated) usually mild, dys-/hyper-/hypo-/paraesthesia’s was infrequent in 
the placebo-controlled data of the combined AA and vitiligo data, and this frequency was only 
slightly (~1%) higher in the ritlecitinib 50 mg group as compared to placebo. There were few 
participants with adjudicated neurosensory deafness, unilateral deafness, hypoacusis, or tinnitus, 
in the PCPAAV data set, with no difference between treatment groups. Overall, most neurological 
and audiological events, whether adjudicated or before adjudication was applied, that occurred 
when being treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg were considered treatment-related, and resolved while 
on treatment. However, based on the identified axonal dystrophies in the two dog toxicity studies 
20070068 and 20099163, a potential risk for patients receiving a chronic ritlecitinib dosing regimen 
cannot be fully rejected. This stems from a.) the unambiguity of the findings in chronic dog toxicity 
studies, b.) the lack of understanding of its pathogenesis, c.) the reactivity of ritlecitinib to 
covalently and irreversibly react with off-target proteins (including the nervous system), d.) the 
suspected accumulative aetiology of the axonal dystrophies as suggested in study 20099163, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 168/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
e.) from the fact that no such effects were found in non-clinical studies of similar covalent inhibitor 
products. 
While the applicant’s position that the reversibility of the axonal dystrophies in the two dog toxicity 
studies 20070068 and 20099163 is reassuring is supported, a risk to patients on a chronic dosing 
regimen cannot be fully excluded. Consequently, the applicant agreed to include a warning in 
SmPC section 4.4 and to follow-up on this safety concern post approval (see RMP). In addition, the 
applicant will closely monitor neurological and audiological events in future PSURs. 
The applicant has performed two retrospective observational studies in patients with AA, in 
Denmark and the US, to acquire background rates of AESI, such as serious infections, thrombotic 
events, and malignancy Limitations, however, are that the Danish cohort was hospital-based 
(inpatient and outpatient) and the US cohort claims based, which makes it more likely that 
especially severe cases are collected. To some extent, this matches the proposed indication for 
ritlecitinib, being severe AA (SALT>50%), while SALT or extent of hair loss was not available in the 
observational data. For serious adverse events such as death and malignancy or myocardial 
infarction, a lower degree of ascertainment bias can be assumed than that for events like hearing 
loss. It is doubted whether the estimates of the occurrence of hearing loss in the observational 
data is unbiased and can be meaningfully compared to the trials where auditory assessment had 
been performed. Although the bias will be conservative (to the disadvantage of ritlecitinib), the 
meaning of a between-group difference remains unclear. 
MACE was infrequent in the clinical data; three cases of MACE occurred after one year of exposure 
in 3 patients: acute myocardial infarction, retinal artery occlusion, and sudden cardiac death. In 
addition, there was 1 event of a fatal myocardial infarction in an UC study. The IR/100 PY (95% CI) 
of MACE in the All-exposure 50 mg group of 0.15 (0.03 – 0.43) was lower than reported in the TS 
AA subcohorts in US study B7981051 with 1.2 (0.99 – 1.45) and the Danish study B7981049 with 
0.58 (0.44 – 0.74). All three cases of MACE in the AA study also had other risk factors for MACE. 
There was a single event of VTE (PE) in the data of the All-exposure cohort on 50 mg (N=1521). 
Although the patient had multiple risk factors for PE, the event was considered related by the 
sponsor. 
According to the non-clinical data (see non-clinical discussion), there were no definite findings of 
MACE and VTE. According to the laboratory data, ritlecitinib is associated with decreased platelet 
counts and a small increase in blood lipids. However, the average changes were small and only in a 
few cases led to clinically meaningful changes, and do not seem to be relevant in causing MACE or 
VTE.  
Therefore, a causal relation between ritlecitinib and MACE cannot be concluded based on the 
currently available non-clinical and clinical data. It, however, has to be considered that the clinical 
studies were relatively short and that the AA and vitiligo study populations are relatively young 
without strong accumulation of other risk factors for MACE, as compared to, e.g. the average 
population with other auto-immune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Given the consideration 
of MACE as a class effect of oral JAK inhibitors authorised for the treatment of chronic inflammatory 
disorders, risks for MACE and VTE cannot be totally discarded. Therefore, MACE and 
thromboembolic events, including MI and VTE, were considered an important potential risk in the 
RMP and will be followed up post-approval (see RMP). In addition, appropriate warnings on MACE 
and VTE were included in the section 4.4 of the SmPC, in line with those included for Sotyktu. 
The occurrence of serious infections in the ritlecitinib group treated with 50 mg can be 
appreciated as low, while it must be recognised that the AA study population is relatively young 
and presumably overall healthy. The occurrence of serious infections in the AA trials was lower 
than seen in the US and Danish AA cohorts used as reference. However, based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 169/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immunosuppressive mechanism of action of ritlecitinib and based on the occurrence of serious 
infection that especially occurred in the higher doses of 50 mg and 30 mg, a causal relation of 
ritlecitinib and infections, potentially including serious infections, cannot be excluded. The applicant 
considered serious infections and opportunistic infections as ‘important potential risk’ in the RMP, 
and this is agreed. Active serious infections, including tuberculosis are considered as contra-
indications, in line with the warnings. 
The occurrence of malignancies, including NMSC, in the ritlecitinib group treated with 50 mg 
can be appreciated as low, while it must be recognised that the AA study population is relatively 
young and presumably overall healthy, and follow-up is relatively short. In the placebo-controlled 
AA trial, two cases of breast cancer occurred within the first year of exposure; both patients used 
the 50 mg dose. In the all-exposure pool, there were 7 participants with adjudicated malignancies 
(excluding NMSC): lobular breast carcinoma (n=1), breast cancer (n=3), testis cancer (n=1) and 
papillary thyroid cancer (n=1). One additional adjudicated event of malignant melanoma was 
reported after the 35-day reporting period.  
The occurrence of malignancies in the AA trials was lower than seen in the US and Danish AA 
cohorts used as reference. However, based on the immunosuppressive mechanism of action of 
ritlecitinib and based on the occurrence of malignancies that especially occurred in the higher doses 
of 50 mg, a causal relation between ritlecitinib and malignancies cannot be excluded. In addition, 
malignancies are considered a class effect of oral JAKis (Art. 20 referral), this is also in line with 
other immunomodulating treatments. Occurrences of malignancies in the non-clinical data align 
with the mode-of-action of ritlecitinib, although it generally occurred at supratherapeutic exposures 
(see non-clinical discussion). NMSC is included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be 
followed-up post-approval (see RMP). In addition, appropriate warning on malignancies was 
included in the section 4.4 of the SmPC.   
Regarding laboratory values, the applicant proposed that ‘platelet count decreased’, ‘lymphocyte 
decreased’ and ‘blood creatine phosphokinase increased’ as ADRs. This is agreed upon based on 
the available data of the placebo-controlled pool and the one-year follow-up data. Blood lipids 
showed a net increase over time in TC and LDL-C that was numerically higher than placebo, but 
overall, there was no clear dose-response relationship, and the changes are small. Therefore, it can 
be accepted that blood lipid changes are not considered as ADR. Cases with increases in liver 
enzymes over the ULN were relatively infrequent but were more frequent on ritlecitinib than 
placebo, and in the follow-up data, cases with hepatic AEs clustered in the higher (50 mg) dose 
group. Therefore, liver enzymes elevated were considered as ADR and were thus included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Safety in special populations 
Adolescents 
Data on adolescents had not been collected in the EU as agreed as part of the CHMP Scientific 
Advice received. Therefore, the applicant included an extrapolation report comparing EU adults with 
ex-EU adults and ex-EU adolescents. Data on growth (height, weight), AEs (fractures), and 
development (Tanner scale, neuropsychological development) of adolescents were included in the 
dossier. The non-clinical data in juvenile animals were completed during the procedure. According 
to the non-clinical data, in short- and long-duration toxicity studies in non-pregnant animals (dogs 
and rats) of comparable age to adolescents, there were no bone findings (macroscopically or 
microscopically) observed following administration of reflectional during a developmental period in 
which rats have open growth plates and growing long bones (also see non-clinical section). 
Nevertheless, as clinical follow-up data are still limited, growth and bone safety in adolescents will 
be followed-up post-approval (see RMP).  
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 170/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were ~130 adolescents exposed to ritlecitinib 50 mg for at least one year in studies 015 
and 032. In the placebo-controlled data of study 015, the overall safety profile of ritlecitinib was 
similar for adolescents and adults. In the combined 50 mg group (n=38), the proportion of 
adolescents with at least 1 TEAE was 79% (71% in adults), SAEs did not occur on 50 mg (1.3% in 
adults), there were 2.6% (2.3% in adults) adolescents who permanently discontinued study drug 
due to an AE, and 7.9% of adolescents temporary discontinued (9.4% in adults) due to an AE. 
Acne and nasopharyngitis occurred more frequently in adolescents on ritlecitinib as compared to 
adolescents on placebo and adults. However, this is not valued as a safety concern, and can partly 
be understood from the propensity for these events in the age group. On the short- (24 weeks) as 
well as longer (48 weeks) term, there were no reports of HZ, TB, NMSC, BCC, SCC, MACE, 
thromboembolic events, or ATE in adolescents, and 1 serious infection (appendicitis on 30 mg). 
Although the latency time for these kinds of events is usually long, in adolescents and adults, this 
is reassuring. A priori, these events are unlikely in adolescents. 
No events were adjudicated as neurologic or audiologic events of interest in adolescents. From the 
measurements of height, weight and Tanner staging, there appeared to be no abnormalities. This is 
supported by the non-clinical data in juvenile rats, in which no relevant adverse events were found, 
including no signs of adverse bone homeostasis or bone growth (see non-clinical discussion).  
As long-term data are still limited, ‘long-term safety in adolescent patients including growth and 
bone development, and maturation and pubertal development’ will be followed up post approval 
(see RMP section).  
Pregnancy 
There have been 21 cases of exposure during pregnancy reported in participants exposed to 
ritlecitinib: 12 maternal exposures and 9 partner exposures. The spontaneous abortion rate in 
ritlecitinib for all doses-treated patients was 30% (3/10), and in ritlecitinib 50 mg-treated patients 
was around 37% (3/8). Given that use of ritlecitinib 50 mg in the clinical programme (maternal 
and partner exposure) was very limited and that other JAKis authorised in the treatment of chronic 
inflammatory disorders are also contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and also for non-clinical 
reasons, pregnancy and lactation were included in the SmPC as contra-indications. In addition, the 
applicant also provided a recommendation for a sufficiently long ritlecitinib-free period prior to 
pregnancy initiation. Specifically, the applicant proposes that women of childbearing potential be 
advised to use effective means of contraception during treatment up to at least 1 month following 
the final dose of ritlecitinib. Note that this recommendation was also included in the SmPC in 
section 4.6, this is agreed. Embryofoetal toxicity following exposure in utero will be followed-up 
post approval (see RMP). 
Elderly 
Data on the elderly were scarce, which is in line with the target population encountered in clinical 
practice. It, however, limits the interpretation of safety data in the elderly. In the recently 
concluded Art. 20 referral, it appeared that for other oral JAKis, risks for MACE, VTE, malignancy, 
and serious infections were increased in the elderly (>65 years of age). Therefore, the lack of 
safety data on the elderly was reflected in a warning in section 4.4. of the SmPC. In addition, 
healthcare professionals were informed about the higher incidence of infections in elderly and in 
the diabetic population in general and thus caution should be exercised when treating the elderly 
and patients with diabetes, and that particular attention should be paid with respect to occurrence 
of infections.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of ritlecitinib is overall acceptable. The applicant preferred the 50/50 mg regimen 
over the 200/50 mg regimen, which is accepted, as there were several SAEs, including infections 
and malignancy, in the highest dose regimen, which were absent in the 50 mg dose group. 
Regarding the common AEs, the safety profile of ritlecitinib 50 mg is considered manageable.  
SAEs considered class effects of oral JAKis did occur in patients exposed to ritlecitinib in the 
proposed dose of 50 mg QD (MACE, VTE, malignancy, serious infections), albeit at a low frequency, 
however causality cannot be concluded. Given the limited availability of long-term safety data and 
in view of the recently concluded Article 20 referral on JAK inhibitors, the risk of malignancies, 
NMSC, MACE and other cardiovascular AEs cannot be fully discarded. MACE, thromboembolic 
events (which include MI and VTE), and malignancies including NMSC will be followed-up post-
approval (see RMP). Appropriate warnings were included in the section 4.4. of the SmPC.   
While the reversibility of the axonal dystrophies seen in the two dog toxicity studies 20070068 and 
20099163 is reassuring, a risk to patients on a chronic dosing regimen cannot be fully excluded. 
Consequently, a warning was included in SmPC section 4.4 and this safety issue will be followed-up 
post approval (see RMP). 
Pregnancy and lactation were included as contra-indication in SmPC section 4.3. Women of 
childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month 
following the final dose of Litfulo.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for ritlecitinib is ‘for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older’.  
Ritlecitinib is an oral covalent irreversible inhibitor of the 5 TEC family kinases (BMX, BTK, ITK, 
TEC, TXK) and JAK3. It lacks activity against JAK1 and JAK2, leading to a narrower spectrum of 
cytokine inhibition. JAK3 and TEC kinases regulate the response of CD8+ T, NK and mast cells 
thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of alopecia areata (AA). 
Alopecia areata is a chronic immune-mediated disorder that targets hair follicles and causes 
nonscarring hair loss. Although AA most commonly affects the scalp presenting with discrete 
patches of alopecia, other hair-bearing areas, such as the eyebrows, eyelashes and body, can also 
be involved. In severe AA, patients may experience loss of all scalp hair (alopecia totalis - AT) or all 
hair (alopecia universalis - AU). AA prevalence is independent of a geographic region, and AA 
affects males and females equally. Both children and adults can be affected. Spontaneous hair 
regrowth is common, although most patients suffer more than one episode of the disease. 
Approximately 10% of patients with AA progress to AT or AU. 
AA is a disease with a high psychological burden, and the aim of treatment is to reach durable hair 
regrowth in affected areas with an acceptable appearance from the patient’s perspective. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In May 2022, baricitinib (inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2) has been centrally approved in the EU for the 
treatment of severe AA in adults. No other products are centrally approved for the treatment of AA. 
However, some authorised medications (e.g., methylprednisolone and triamcinolone intra-lesion 
injections) are available in individual member states. Current guidelines advise on topical 
(corticosteroids and minoxidil) or systemic therapies (corticosteroids, corticosteroid-sparing agents 
such as cyclosporin and methotrexate, and biologicals such as ustekinumab) (European 
Dermatology Forum, S3 guideline 2017; British Association of Dermatologists (BAD): Guidelines for 
the management of alopecia areata, 2012). The response to treatment varies widely; few well-
designed clinical trials have evaluated these therapies. Therefore, there still is an unmet medical 
need for patients with severe AA. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical programme to support the efficacy of ritlecitinib in AA consists of 3 studies: one single 
pivotal study (B7981015), one supportive Phase 2a study (B7931005), and a long-term study 
(B7981032), all in participants with AA. In addition, the comparative safety study (B7981037) also 
included efficacy data. Only the main study i.e. pivotal study (B7981015) is discussed here. 
The single pivotal phase 2b/3 study (B7981015) was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study to compare the efficacy and safety of 5 regimens 
(200/50 mg QD, 50 mg QD, 200/30 mg QD, 30 mg QD, 10 mg QD) of ritlecitinib to placebo in 
adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age with AA and ≥50% of scalp hair loss. The doses of 30 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 180/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QD and 50 mg QD were both also studied with a loading dose of 200 mg QD for 4 weeks; the 10 
mg dose was included for dose-ranging. The placebo-controlled phase lasted 24 weeks; the 
complete study lasted 48 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was SALT≤10 at week 24, with 
PGI-C response (patient-reported change) as a secondary outcome. There were N=718 patients 
included, and of those n=130 were treated with 50 mg QD, 131 with 200/50 mg QD, and 131 with 
placebo. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Placebo-controlled phase 
The primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint were both met. The response in SALT≤10 
(primary outcome) in the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg (21%), 200/30 mg (13%), 50 mg (13%) and 30 
mg (11%) groups was larger than placebo (1.5%) at week 24, at a significance level of p< 0.005, 
corrected for multiplicity. The mean difference (95%CI) with placebo was 20% (12% - 28%) for 
the 200/50 mg group and 12% (5% - 18%) for the 50 mg group. 
The response in PGI-C in the ritlecitinib 200/50 mg (52%), 200/30 mg (45%), 50 mg (49%) and 
30 mg (42%) groups was larger than in placebo (9%) at week 24, at a significance level of p< 
0.005 corrected for multiplicity. The mean difference (95%CI) with placebo was 43% (32% - 54%) 
for the 200/50 mg group and 40% (29% - 51%) for the 50 mg group. 
Also, for SALT ≤20 response at week 24, ritlecitinib 200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg and 30 mg 
were significantly different from placebo, at a significance level of < 0.01. The mean difference 
(95%CI) with placebo was 28% (19% - 37%) for the 200/50 mg group and 21% (13% - 29%) for 
the 50 mg group. 
Maintenance of effect 
From week 24 to week 48, the proportion of participants with a response in SALT≤10, PGI-C 
response, or SALT≤20 further increased (respectively 31%, 56%, and 43%). Those participants 
who, by design, switched from placebo to ritlecitinib after Week 24 showed an average response at 
week 48 (SALT≤10:14%; SALT≤20:19%), which was similar to that of participants at Week 24 
treated with the same regimen from the start (SALT≤10:14%; SALT≤20:23%). 
Supportive outcomes 
These effects are supported by similar effects in the regrowth of eyebrows (EBA) and eyelashes 
(ELA), in patients who had hair loss at these sites and by the patient-reported impression of 
improvement (AAPPO), defined as achieving a score of 0 (‘no hair loss’) or 1 (‘little hair loss’) on 
each of the 4 AAPPO hair loss items.  
Consistency over subgroups 
According to the forest plots, treatment with ritlecitinib 50 mg resulted in a higher proportion of 
SALT≤10 responders and of PGI-C responders than placebo in most subgroups, including 
adolescents. 
There was a similar SALT≤10 response (primary outcome) and PGI-C response (key secondary 
outcome) for ritlecitinib 50 mg as compared to placebo in ex-EU adolescents, ex-EU adults and EU 
adults.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The dose-ranging design of the pivotal study is considered acceptable, although it yielded a low 
number of participants in each treatment group. The effects in the 50/50 mg group are to some 
extent supported by the effects in the 200/50 mg group and the dose-response relation seen over 
the treatment groups. The recommended dose of 50 mg once daily is thus supported.  
The effect in the AT/AU group was smaller. Nevertheless, this clinical finding was adequately 
reflected in the SmPC section 5.1.  
Although this application is based on a single pivotal study, this study is considered 
methodologically adequate, and the efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated as revealed by 
primary and secondary outcomes at various time-points and across most subgroups.  
From the simulation analysis results and the limited data in the proof-of-concept study, it seems 
that treatment cannot be stopped in case of good response, without losing response, which is 
expected given the pathophysiology of AA. The benefit-risk of treatment should nevertheless be re-
assessed at regular intervals on an individual basis. 
The inclusion in the SmPC of a stopping rule in case of non-response is supported; however, based 
on the updated analysis from study B7981032, 36 weeks is a more appropriate time point to stop 
treatment in non-responders. Therefore, section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated as follows: 
‘Consideration should be given to discontinuing patients who show no evidence of therapeutic 
benefit after 36 weeks.’ 
Only a few elderly participants were enrolled in the main study (<5%); the lack of efficacy data in 
the elderly has been reflected accordingly in the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the phase 2/3 studies, 1521 participants (1763 patient-years) were exposed to ritlecitinib 50 mg 
or higher. There were 1011 participants with at least 12 months (48 weeks) of exposure, and there 
were 1334 participants who had ≥6 months of exposure to ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher. Among 
these participants, 172 were adolescents, including 133 adolescents with at least 48 weeks of 
exposure to ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher. 
Common adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, the most frequent events (2% in any treatment group) that 
occurred more commonly (>1%) in the ritlecitinib 50/50 mg group than in the placebo group 
included: nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, headache, acne, urticaria, rash, upper abdominal pain, 
pyrexia, folliculitis, SARS-CoV-2 test positive and Covid-19, dizziness, and atopic dermatitis. In 
addition, tinnitus, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, blood creatinine phosphokinase increased, and 
back pain were numerically more common in the 50 mg dose groups as compared to placebo. 
Lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia did not occur. In the one-year exposure data, the 
most common TEAEs in the ritlecitinib groups were similar to those in the placebo-controlled AA 
pool. Diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dizziness, acne and urticaria, 
and pyrexia were more frequent in the 50 mg and/or 30 mg dose groups compared to the 10 mg 
group. 
Infections and infestations (SOC) occurred in 38% of patients in the combined 50 mg group, 37% 
in the 30 mg group, 32% in the 10 mg group and in 31% of the placebo group; this proportion was 
higher in the 200/50 mg group (41%) as compared to the 50/50 mg group (33%). Herpes zoster 
was infrequent but occurred in 2 patients (1.5%) of the 50/50 mg group and in 2 patients (0.8%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/357337/2023 
Page 182/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the 30 mg group, but not in the 10 mg group or the placebo group. In the one-year exposure 
data, infections and infestations (SOC) were more frequent in the 50 mg group (51%), as 
compared to the 30 mg (47%) and the 10 mg (40%) groups, most commonly nasopharyngitis 
(14% and 16% versus 9.7%) and upper respiratory tract infections (11% and 11% versus 3.2%).  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the All-exposure pool, there were 2 deaths (breast cancer, acute respiratory failure and 
cardiorespiratory arrest) and 1 death (severe myocardial infarction) in the clinical study 
programme for Ulcerative Colitis. The three events were considered unrelated to the study 
medication. 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, there were 4 (1.9%) participants with at least one SAE in the 
200/50 mg group, none in the 50/50 mg group, 1 (0.4%) in the 30 mg group, 2 (3.2%) in the 10 
mg group, and 4 (1.9%) in the placebo group. The SAEs in the 200/50 mg group were: three 
instances of serious infections (appendicitis, empyema, and sepsis), a case of breast carcinoma, 
and a spontaneous abortion. After 48 weeks of treatment, the 6 SAEs that had occurred in the 
combined 50 mg group were: appendicitis, empyema, sepsis, breast cancer and invasive lobular 
breast cancer, spontaneous abortion, and pulmonary embolism. 
Adverse events of special interest 
In safety study 037, the PD safety outcomes (BAEP, axonal swelling) did not show differences 
between the ritlecitinib (200/50 mg) group and the placebo group over 9 months. In the placebo-
controlled AA pool, paraesthesia and dysaesthesia occurred in 1.7% of the combined 50 mg 
group, 1.5% of the 30 mg group, not in the 10 mg group, and 0.9% of the placebo group. The 
occurrence was highest (1.9%) in the 200/50 mg group. Most cases were mild and resolved while 
being on treatment. Treatment-emergent tinnitus was most frequent in the 200/50 mg group 
(2.5%), less frequent in the 50/50 mg group (0.5%), and overall as frequent in the 50 mg group 
(1.5%) as in the placebo group (1.4%). Adjudicated sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 1 
patient each in the ritlecitinib 50 mg, 30 mg and 10 mg groups. In the one-year exposure pool of 
the pivotal AA trial, adjudicated sensorineural hearing loss was still infrequent but occurred only in 
the highest dose groups: 1% (n=3) in the 50 mg group, 0.8% (n=2) in the 30 mg and 0 in the 10 
mg group. 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool and in the one-year follow-up data, few cases of MACE, serious 
infections, malignancies and NMSC occurred in patients treated with ritlecitinib, there was one 
case of PE. The occurrences (IR) were lower than those in the reference cohorts from US and 
Denmark. 
Special populations 
The proportion of elderly participants >65 years (n=30; 2%) experiencing severe AEs, SAEs, and 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuations was higher than adults. Urinary tract infections 
decreased lymphocyte count, and arthralgia were more common in elderly patients as compared to 
adults <65 years. No events were adjudicated as OI, TB, MACE, or ATE. 
In the placebo-controlled AA pool, with adolescents (n=105; 15%), in the combined 50 mg group 
(n=38), the proportion of adolescents with at least 1 TEAE was 79% (71% in adults), SAEs did not 
occur (1.3% in adults), there were 2.6% (2.3% in adults) adolescents who permanently 
discontinued study drug due to an AE, and 7.9% of adolescents temporary discontinued (9.4% in 
adults) due to an AE. There were no reports of HZ, HS, or adjudicated events of OI, TB, MACE, 
malignancy, ATE, or audiologic events of interest in adolescents. Measurements of height and 
weight in adolescents in studies 015 and 032, standardised to the US, did not suggest deviations 
from normal growth.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
As ritlecitinib-mediated axonal dystrophies in dogs were already observed at low safety margins 
(6.0x and 7.4x in terms of Cmax and AUC24, respectively) in respect to clinical exposure, and as 
cumulative exposure appeared to be the relevant determinant of neurotoxicity in study 20099163, 
a risk to patients cannot be excluded. Therefore, a warning was added to the SmPC section 4.4. 
Moreover, neurotoxicity will be followed-up post approval (see RMP). 
Data on the elderly were scarce, which aligns with the target population encountered in clinical 
practice. It, however, limits the interpretation of the safety profile in this population. The lack of 
safety data on the elderly is however reflected in a warning in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Adverse events considered class effects of oral JAKis (MACE, VTE, malignancies, NMSC, serious 
infections) did occur in patients treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg, albeit at low frequencies. 
Occurrences were not higher than those in the US and Danish AA reference cohorts. However, the 
clinical studies were relatively short in duration, and the AA and vitiligo study populations are 
relatively young and without a strong accumulation of other risk factors for MACE, as compared to, 
e.g. the average population with other auto-immune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 
Nevertheless, appropriate warnings were included in the SmPC and those adverse events will also 
be followed-up post-approval (see RMP). 
Considering the safety profile of ritlecitinib, the exposure should be limited where possible. At the 
CHMP’s request, section 4.2 of the SmPC was updated to include the following guidance: ‘The 
benefit-risk of treatment should be re-assessed at regular intervals on an individual basis.’ 
As long-term clinical safety data are still limited, long-term safety in adolescent patients will be 
followed-up post-approval (see RMP). 
Given that use of ritlecitinib 50 mg in the clinical programme (maternal and partner exposure) was 
very limited and that other JAKis authorised in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders are 
contraindicated for use during pregnancy, pregnancy and lactation were included in the SmPC as 
contra-indications. In addition, the applicant also provided a recommendation for a sufficiently long 
ritlecitinib-free period prior to pregnancy initiation. In addition, embryofoetal toxicity following 
exposure in utero will be followed-up post approval (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ritlecitinib has been shown to be effective in the treatment of AA, including adolescents and patients with 
more severe disease. The treatment effects are maintained over time, although time to response takes longer 
than inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This can be expected based on the 
pathophysiology of AA. Although the responses in SALT10 as a primary outcome appear numerically small, it 
is considered a clinically relevant treatment effect. Indeed, SALT10 is a rather stringent measure (‘near 
remission’), and 24 weeks is relatively short for treatment effects in AA. In addition, the larger treatment 
effect supports the clinical relevance in SALT20 and PGI-C. 
In line with the time to respond, it takes at least 36 weeks of treatment before it can be concluded that 
treatment should be stopped in case of insufficient response. There are no data to support stopping 
treatment in case of prolonged good response, however, the limited data available showed that loss of 
response is likely after 6 weeks of interruption. 
The selected study population was representative of the target population as reflected in the approved 
indication and aligns with a population eligible for systemic treatment. Even if there is no universally adopted 
definition of ‘severe AA’ (SALT>50), this was also agreed for the AA indication of Olumiant. 
The application is based on a single pivotal study that included adults and adolescents. This is considered 
acceptable, and in line with the single pivotal study guideline (CPMP/EWP/2330/99). There is a well-grounded 
pharmacologic rationale for the plausibility of ritlecitinib’s efficacy in AA and sufficient internal and external 
validity (demonstrated by, e.g. adequate blinding of all parties, randomisation of participants, well-justified 
inclusion and exclusion criteria). The effect-sizes of primary and secondary outcomes are statistically 
significant at an adequate level for a single pivotal trial. 
The safety profile of ritlecitinib is favourable in the short term but comes with several uncertainties regarding 
long term exposure, neurosafety, class effects of other JAKis approved for the treatment of chronic 
inflammatory disorders; and use in adolescents. These uncertainties however were adequately addressed in 
the SmPC and will be followed-up post approval. 
The main apparent safety concern is the occurrence of infections, most notable upper respiratory tract 
infections which was included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. This is in line with the 
immunomodulating effect of ritlecitinib. The occurrence of infections is considered manageable. Active serious 
infections are a contra-indication.  
Although neurotoxic events were evident in the non-clinical dog studies, neurological events such as par-
/dysaesthesias and neurosensory deafness were infrequent in the clinical data and there was no evidence in 
the clinical data relating these causally to ritlecitinib. However, neurotoxicity for patients cannot be totally 
ruled out, the residual uncertainty is addressed with a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC and will also be 
followed-up post-approval (see RMP). In addition, the applicant will closely monitor neurological and 
audiological events in future PSURs. 
SAEs considered class effects of oral JAKis approved in the chronic treatment of inflammatory disorders did 
occur in patients exposed to ritlecitinib in the proposed dose of 50 mg QD (MACE, VTE, malignancy, serious 
infections), albeit at a low frequency. It is unknown whether the class effects of JAKis do apply to ritlecitinib, 
Assessment report

however, this cannot be fully discarded. Hence warnings were included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In 
addition, thromboembolic events (which include MI, VTE, and MACE) and malignancies (including NMSC) will 
be followed-up post-approval (see RMP). 
The safety data in adolescents (>100 followed for >12 months) on growth (height, weight), AEs (fractures), 
and development (Tanner scale, neuropsychological development) of adolescents did not point to a safety 
risk. This is supported by the non-clinical data that became available during the assessment. However, as 
long-term clinical safety data are limited, growth and bone effects will be followed-up post-marketing (See 
RMP). 
Given the high value patients with severe AA placed on scalp hair regrowth in the patient preference studies 
in adults and adolescents, the net B/R for ritlecitinib 50 mg, compared to no treatment, is considered positive 
from the patient’s perspective. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The primary endpoint was met, which was supported by key secondary endpoints. Primary and secondary 
outcomes support the clinical relevance of the treatment effect. The long-term efficacy of ritlecitinib until 
week 48 data has been demonstrated.  
The treatment is effective in the proposed dose of 50 mg once daily, including adolescents and patients with 
more severe disease. 
Dosing recommendations for stopping in case of non-response were included in the SmPC at the CHMP’s 
request.  
The safety profile of ritlecitinib is overall acceptable and considered manageable.  
The balance of benefits and risks of Litfulo for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older is positive in the following indication: 
‘Litfulo is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and 
older (see section 5.1).’ 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Litfulo is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Litfulo is favourable in the following indication:

o 
o 
Language on the risk of infections during treatment with Litfulo. 
Language recommending that risk factors for infections should be considered when prescribing 
ritlecitinib including elderly age and diabetes. 
o  Details on how to reduce the risk of infection with specific clinical measures (what laboratory 
parameters should be used to initiate Litfulo, screening for TB, and screening for viral hepatitis 
and temporary interruption of Litfulo if an infection is not responding to appropriate therapy until 
the infection is controlled). 
o 
Language stating the use of live, attenuated vaccines should be avoided during or immediately 
prior to treatment along with examples of live, attenuated vaccines. 
•  Potential risk of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and 
arterial thrombosis  
o 
Language describing that events of venous and arterial thromboembolism, including MACE, have 
been observed in studies in Litfulo. 
o  Details of how to reduce the potential risk: Litfulo should be used with caution in patients with 
known risk factors for thromboembolism. In patients with a suspected thromboembolic event, 
discontinuation of Litfulo and prompt re-evaluation is recommended. The risks and benefits of 
treatment should be considered prior to initiating Litfulo therapy in patients.  
•  Potential risk of malignancy 
o 
Language describing that malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer, have been 
observed in studies with Litfulo. 
o  Details of how to reduce the potential risk with specific clinical measures (that the risks and 
benefits of Litfulo treatment should be considered prior to initiating in patients with a known 
malignancy or when considering continuing Litfulo therapy in patients who develop a malignancy, 
and that periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin 
cancer). 
•  Potential risk of neurotoxicity 
o 
Language describing that ritlecitinib-related axonal dystrophy has been observed in chronic 
Beagle dog toxicity studies at systemic exposures of at least 7.4-times the expected exposure in 
patients treated with 50 mg per day. At a systemic exposure that was 33-times above the 
expected exposure in patients treated with 50 mg per day, axonal dystrophy was associated with 
neurological hearing loss. While these findings proved to reverse after dosing cessation of 
ritlecitinib in dogs, a risk to patients at a chronic dosing regimen cannot be fully excluded. 
Available clinical data has not indicated an effect on neurological or audiological outcomes.

New Active Substance Status 
Litfulo. 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ritlecitinib is to be qualified as a 
new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0147/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ORSERDU monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with 
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an 
activating ESR1 mutation who have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine 
therapy including a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with ORSERDU should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer should be selected for treatment 
with ORSERDU based on the presence of an activating ESR1 mutation in plasma specimens, using a 
CE marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) with the corresponding intended purpose. If the CE-marked IVD 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is not available, the presence of an activating ESR1 mutation in plasma specimens should be assessed 
by an alternative validated test. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 345 mg (one 345 mg film-coated tablet), once daily. 
The maximum recommended daily dose of ORSERDU is 345 mg. 
Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, it can be taken immediately within 6 hours after the time it is usually taken. After 
more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. On the next day, ORSERDU should be 
taken at the usual time. 
Vomiting 
If the patient vomits after taking the ORSERDU dose, the patient should not take an additional dose on 
that day and should resume the usual dosing schedule the next day at the usual time. 
Dose modifications 
The recommended elacestrant dose modifications for patients with adverse reactions (see section 4.8) 
are provided in Tables 1 and 2:

Dose modification 
Consider interruption of ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or 
baseline. Then resume ORSERDU at the same dose level. 
Interrupt ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. The dose 
should be reduced to 258 mg when resuming therapy. 
If the Grade 3 toxicity recurs, interrupt ORSERDU until recovery to 
Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. The reduced dose of 258 mg may be resumed if at 
the discretion of the treating physician if the patient is benefiting from 
treatment. If a Grade 3 or intolerable adverse reaction recurs, 
permanently discontinue ORSERDU. 
Interrupt ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. The dose 
should be reduced to 258 mg when resuming therapy. 
If a Grade 4 or intolerable adverse reaction recurs, permanently 
discontinue ORSERDU. 
Use of ORSERDU with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and an alternative 
concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, the elacestrant dose should be reduced to 86 mg once 
daily with careful monitoring of tolerability. If a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, the 
elacestrant dose should be reduced to 172 mg once daily with careful monitoring of tolerability. 
Subsequent dose reduction to 86 mg once daily may be considered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
based on tolerability. 
If the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the elacestrant dose should be increased to the dose used 
prior to the initiation of the CYP3A4 inhibitor (after 5 half-lives of the CYP3A4 inhibitor) (see 
sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). 
No dose adjustments are required for coadministration of ORSERDU with mild CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(see section 4.5). 
Use of ORSERDU with CYP3A4 inducers 
Concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided and an alternative 
concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. 
If a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be used for a short duration of time (i.e. ≤ 3 days) or 
intermittently (i.e. treatment periods ≤ 3 days separated by at least 2 weeks or 1 week + 5 half-lives of 
the CYP3A4 inducer, whichever is longer), continue elacestrant without increasing the dose. 
No dose adjustments are required for coadministration of ORSERDU with mild CYP3A4 inducers 
(see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age. Limited data are available in patients 
≥ 75 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). In 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), ORSERDU dose should be reduced to 
258 mg. Elacestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), 
therefore no dose recommendation can be made for patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment in subjects with renal impairment is necessary. Elacestrant has not been studied in 
patients with severe renal impairment, therefore no dose recommendation can be made for patients 
with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ORSERDU in children from birth to 18 years of age has not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
ORSERDU is for oral use. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole. They should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to 
swallowing. Patients should take their dose of ORSERDU at approximately the same time each day. 
ORSERDU should be administered with a light meal. Administration with food may also reduce 
nausea and vomiting (see section 5.2).

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic impairment 
ORSERDU is metabolised by the liver, and impaired hepatic function can increase the risk for adverse 
reactions. Therefore, ORSERDU should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment and 
patients should be regularly and closely monitored for adverse reactions. Administration of elacestrant 
should be undertaken with caution at a dose of 258 mg once daily in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2). In the absence of clinical data, elacestrant is not recommended in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see section 4.2). 
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant administration of ORSERDU with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors including, but not limited 
to: clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice 
should be avoided. An alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to 
inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, ORSERDU 
dose adjustment should be applied (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of ORSERDU with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors including, but not 
limited to: aprepitant, ciprofloxacin, conivaptan, crizotinib, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, 
erythromycin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, imatinib, isavuconazole, tofisopam and 
verapamil should be avoided. An alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal 
potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered. If the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be 
avoided, ORSERDU dose adjustment should be applied (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers 
Concomitant administration of ORSERDU with strong CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited 
to: phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine and St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) should be 
avoided. An alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce 
CYP3A4 should be considered. If the strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, ORSERDU dose 
adjustment should be applied (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of ORSERDU with moderate CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited 
to: bosentan, cenobamate, dabrafenib, efavirenz, etravirine, lorlatinib, phenobarbital, primidone and 
sotorasib should be avoided. An alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal 
potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. If the moderate CYP3A4 inducer cannot be 
avoided, ORSERDU dose adjustment should be applied (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Thromboembolic events 
Thromboembolic events are commonly observed in patients with advanced breast cancer and have 
been observed in clinical studies with ORSERDU (see section 4.8). This should be taken into 
consideration when prescribing ORSERDU to patients at risk. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
ORSERDU is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and is a substrate of the Organic Anion Transporting 
Polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1). ORSERDU is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer 
Resistance Protein (BCRP) efflux transporters.

Effect of other medicinal products on ORSERDU 
CYP3A4 Inhibitors 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily for 7 days) with 
ORSERDU (172 mg once daily for 7 days) increased elacestrant plasma exposure (AUCinf) and the 
peak concentration (Cmax) in healthy subjects 5.3 and 4.4-fold, respectively. 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations in cancer patients suggested that the 
concomitant administration of multiple daily doses of elacestrant 345 mg and itraconazole 200 mg 
may increase elacestrant steady-state AUC and Cmax 5.5- and 3.9-fold, respectively, which may 
increase the risk of adverse reactions. 
PBPK simulations in cancer patients suggested that concomitant administration of multiple daily doses 
of elacestrant 345 mg with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase elacestrant steady-state AUC 
and Cmax by 2.3- and 1.9-folds, respectively, with fluconazole (200 mg once daily), and by 3.9- and 
3.0-folds, respectively, with erythromycin (500 mg four times a day), which may increase the risk of 
adverse reaction. 
CYP3A4 Inducers 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days) with a 
single dose of ORSERDU 345 mg decreased elacestrant plasma exposure (AUCinf) and the peak 
concentration (Cmax) in healthy subjects by 86% and 73%, respectively, which may decrease 
elacestrant activity. 
PBPK simulations in cancer patients suggested that the concomitant administration of multiple daily 
doses of elacestrant 345 mg and rifampicin 600 mg may decrease elacestrant steady-state AUC and 
Cmax by 84% and 77%, respectively, which may decrease elacestrant activity. 
PBPK simulations in cancer patients suggested that the concomitant administration of multiple daily 
doses of elacestrant 345 mg and the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz (600 mg) may decrease 
elacestrant steady-state AUC and Cmax by 57% and 52%, respectively, which may decrease elacestrant 
activity. 
OATP2B1 inhibitors 
Elacestrant is a substrate of OATP2B1 in vitro. As it cannot be excluded that the coadministration of 
OATP2B1 inhibitors may increase the exposure of elacestrant, which may increase the risk of adverse 
reactions, caution is recommended in case of concomitant use of ORSERDU with OATP2B1 
inhibitors. 
Effect of ORSERDU on other medicinal products 
P-gp substrates 
Co-administration of ORSERDU (345 mg, single dose) with digoxin (0.5 mg, single dose) increased 
digoxin exposure by 27% for Cmax and 13% for AUC. Digoxin administration should be monitored and 
its dose reduced as necessary. 
Concomitant use of ORSERDU with other P-gp substrates may increase their concentrations, which 
may increase the adverse reactions associated with the P-gp substrates. The dose of coadministered 
P-gp substrates should be reduced according to their Summary of Product Characteristics. 
BCRP substrates 
Co-administration of ORSERDU (345 mg, single dose) with rosuvastatin (20 mg, single dose) 
increased rosuvastatin exposure by 45% for Cmax and 23% for AUC. Rosuvastatin administration 
should be monitored and its dose reduced as necessary. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant use of ORSERDU with other BCRP substrates may increase their concentrations, which 
may increase the adverse reactions associated with the BCRP substrates. The dose of coadministered 
BCRP substrates should be reduced according to their Summary of Product Characteristics. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
ORSERDU should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. Based on the mechanism of action of elacestrant and findings from reproductive 
toxicity studies in animals, ORSERDU can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. 
Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
with ORSERDU and one week after the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of elacestrant in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). ORSERDU should not be used during pregnancy or in women 
of childbearing potential not using contraception. The pregnancy status of females of reproductive 
potential should be verified prior to starting treatment with ORSERDU. If pregnancy occurs while 
taking ORSERDU, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus and potential risk 
of miscarriage. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether elacestrant/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in the breast-fed infant, it is recommended that lactating women should not 
breast-feed during treatment with ORSERDU and one week after the last dose of ORSERDU. 
Fertility 
Based on findings from animal studies (see section 5.3) and its mechanism of action, ORSERDU may 
impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ORSERDU has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, since 
fatigue, asthenia, and insomnia have been reported in some patients taking elacestrant (see 
section 4.8), caution should be observed by patients who experience those adverse reactions when 
driving or operating machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common (≥ 10%) adverse reactions with ORSERDU were nausea, triglycerides increased, 
cholesterol increased, vomiting, fatigue, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, calcium decreased, back pain, creatinine 
increased, arthralgia, sodium decreased, constipation, headache, hot flush, abdominal pain, anaemia, 
potassium decreased, and alanine aminotransferase increased. The most common Grade ≥3 (≥2%) 
adverse reactions of elacestrant were nausea (2.7%), AST increased (2.7%), ALT increased (2.3%), 
anaemia (2%), back pain (2%), and bone pain (2%). 
Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 1% of patients included nausea, dyspnoea, and 
thromboembolism (venous).

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions described in the list below reflect exposure to elacestrant in 301 patients with breast 
cancer in three open label studies (RAD1901-105, RAD1901-106, and RAD1901-308) in which 
patients received elacestrant 400 mg once daily as a single agent. The frequencies of adverse reactions 
are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies identified in patients exposed to elacestrant at the 
recommended dose in the target indication, whereas frequencies for changes in laboratory parameters 
are based on worsening from baseline by at least 1 grade and shifts to ≥ grade 3. The median duration 
of treatment was 85 days (range 5 to 1288). 
The adverse reaction frequencies from clinical trials are based on all-cause adverse event frequencies, 
where a proportion of the events for an adverse reaction may have other causes than the drug, such as 
the disease, other medication or unrelated causes. 
The following convention is used for the classification of the frequency of an adverse drug reaction 
(ADR) and is based on the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 
guidelines: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Nausea 
Nausea was reported in 35% of patients. Grade 3-4 nausea events were reported in 2.5% of patients. 
Nausea was generally reported early, with a median time to the first onset 14 days (range: 1 to 490 
days). Nausea occurred more frequently in the first cycle and from Cycle 2 onward, the incidence of 
nausea was generally lower in subsequent cycles (i.e., over time). Prophylactic treatment for nausea 
was prescribed for 12 (5%) subjects in the elacestrant arm and 28 (11.8%) received an antiemetic for 
the treatment of nausea during the on-treatment period. 
Elderly 
In the RAD1901-308 study, 104 patients who received elacestrant were ≥ 65 years and 40 patients 
were ≥ 75 years. Gastrointestinal disorders were reported more frequently in patients aged ≥ 75 years. 
Monitoring of treatment emergent adverse reactions by the treating physician, should include 
consideration of the patient’s age and comorbidities, when selecting  personalised interventions. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest dose of ORSERDU administered in clinical studies was 1000 mg per day. The adverse 
drug reactions reported in association with doses higher than the recommended dose were consistent 
with the established safety profile (see section 4.8). The frequency and severity of gastrointestinal 
disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting) appeared to be dose-related. There is no 
known antidote for an overdose of ORSERDU. Patients should be closely monitored and treatment of 
overdose should consist of supportive treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, anti estrogen, ATC code: L02BA04 
Mechanism of action 
Elacestrant, a tetrahydronaphthalene compound, is a potent, selective and orally active estrogen 
receptor-α (ERα) antagonist and degrader. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Elacestrant inhibits the estradiol-dependent and independent growth of ERα-positive breast cancer 
cells, including models harbouring estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene mutations. Elacestrant displayed 
potent antitumor activity in patient derived xenograft models previously exposed to multiple endocrine 
therapies, harbouring wild type ESR1 or ESR1 gene mutations in the ligand binding domain. 
In patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer with a median of 2.5 prior lines of endocrine therapy, 
dosed with elacestrant dihydrochloride 400 mg (345 mg of elacestrant) daily, median reduction in 
tumour 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (FES) uptake from baseline to Day 14 was 88.7% demonstrating 
reduced ER availability and antitumor activity measured by FES-PET/CT in patients with prior 
endocrine therapies. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of ORSERDU in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer following 
prior endocrine therapy in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor was evaluated in RAD1901-308, a 
randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial which compared ORSERDU with standard 
of care (SOC) (fulvestrant for patients who received prior aromatase inhibitors in the metastatic setting 
or aromatase inhibitors for patients who received fulvestrant in the metastatic setting). Eligible patients 
included post-menopausal women and men whose disease had relapsed or progressed on at least 1 and 
no more than 2 prior lines of endocrine therapy. All patients were required to have Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)performance status of 0 or 1, and evaluable lesions per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, i.e., measurable disease or bone 
only disease with evaluable lesions. Prior endocrine therapy must have included a combination with 
CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and no more than 1 prior line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic 
breast cancer. Patients were required to be appropriate candidates for endocrine monotherapy. Patients 
with presence of symptomatic metastatic visceral disease, patients with cardiac comorbidity, and 
patients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded. 
A total of 478 patients were randomised 1:1 to daily oral administration of 400 mg of elacestrant 
dihydrochloride (345 mg of elacestrant) or standard of care (SOC) (239 on elacestrant and 239 on 
SOC), including a total of 228 patients (47.7%) with ESR1 mutations at baseline (115 patients on 
elacestrant and 113 patients on SOC). Among the 239 patients randomised to the SOC arm, 166 
received fulvestrant, and 73 received an aromatase inhibitor that included anastrozole, letrozole or 
exemestane. Randomisation was stratified by ESR1 mutations status (ESR1-mut vs ESR1-mut-nd [no 
ESR1 mutations detected]), prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs no), and visceral metastasis (yes vs 
no). ESR1 mutational status was determined by blood circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid 
(ctDNA) using the Guardant360 CDx assay and was limited to ESR1 missense mutations in the ligand 
binding domain (between codons 310 to 547). 
The median age of patients (ORSERDU vs standard of care) at baseline was 63.0 years (range of 24-
89) vs 63.0 (range of 32-83) and 45.0% were over 65 (43.5 vs 46.4). Most patients were women 
(97.5% vs 99.6%) and most patients were white (88.4% vs 87.2%), followed by Asian (8.4% vs 8.2%), 
Black or African American (2.6% vs 4.1%), and Other/Unknown (0.5% vs 0.5%). Baseline ECOG 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performance status was 0 (59.8% vs 56.5%), 1 (40.2% vs 43.1%) or > 1 (0% vs 0.4%). Patient 
demographics for those with ESR1-mutated tumors were generally representative of the broader study 
population. The median duration of exposure to ORSERDU was 2.8 months (range: 0.4 to 24.8). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC (Independent 
Review Committee) in all patients, i.e., including patients with an ESR1 mutation, and in patients with 
ESR1 mutations. A statistically significant PFS benefit was observed in all patients with a median PFS 
of 2.79 months in the Orserdu arm as compared with 1.91 months in the standard of care arm (HR= 
0.70, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.88). Efficacy results are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1 for patients with 
ESR1 mutations.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ORSERDU in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The elacestrant oral bioavailability is approximately 10%. Steady state is reached by Day 6 following 
once daily dosing. Cmax and AUC increase slightly more than proportional to dose for doses ≥ 50 mg 
(salt form). 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, elacestrant was rapidly absorbed, reaching Cmax within 1-4 hours. The 
geometric mean Cmax was 52.86 ng/mL (35.2% coefficient of variation [CV%]) and AUCinf was 
1566 ng*h/mL (38.4% CV) after single dose administration of 345 mg of elacestrant in fed conditions. 
At steady state, the median [min, max] plasma concentration at 4h post-dose (C4h) and AUC are 
predicted to be 108 ng/mL [27.5 – 351] and 2190 ng*h/mL [461 – 8470], respectively. 
Effect of food 
Administration of elacestrant 345 mg tablet with a high-fat high-calorie meal increased Cmax and AUC 
by 40% and 20%, respectively, as compared to fasted administration. When the tablet was co-
administered with a light meal, Cmax and AUC increased in a similar fashion, i.e., by 30 and 20%, 
respectively. Ingestion with food may reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of elacestrant is > 99% and independent of concentration and hepatic 
impairment status. Elacestrant penetrates the blood brain barrier in a dose-dependent manner. 
Following once daily administration of elacestrant for 7 consecutive days, median concentrations of 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
elacestrant in the cerebrospinal fluid were 0.0966 ng/mL and 0.155 ng/mL at the doses of 200 and 
500 mg, respectively. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, elacestrant is extensively distributed in the tissues with 
an apparent peripheral volume of distribution of 5411 L. The apparent central volume of distribution 
of elacestrant at steady state is 422 L. 
Biotransformation 
Elacestrant was a minor (< 10% of plasma radioactivity) component in human plasma. 4-[2-
(Ethylamino)ethyl]benzoic acid (EAEBA) glucuronide was a major human plasma metabolite (about 
41% of plasma radioactivity). Elacestrant is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 with a potential small 
contribution by CYP2A6 and CYP2C9. 
Elimination 
The half-life of elacestrant is predicted to be approximately 30 hours. After a single dose, the mean (% 
CV) clearance of elacestrant was 220.3 L/hr (38.4%). At steady state, the mean (% CV) clearance of 
elacestrant is predicted to be 186 L/hr (43.5%). 
Following a single oral dose of 345 mg radiolabeled elacestrant, 81.5% (majority as unchanged) was 
recovered in feces and 7.53% (trace as unchanged) was recovered in urine. Elacestrant renal clearance 
is very low (≤ 2.3 mL/min) and it was eliminated by oxidative metabolism and fecal excretion. 
Special populations 
Effect of age, weight and gender 
From analyses of population pharmacokinetic data in cancer patients, no dose adjustment is warranted 
based on body weight, age, and gender. 
Hepatic impairment 
The Cmax and AUC values were similar between subjects in the mild hepatic impairment group (Child-
Pugh A) and the normal hepatic function group upon single dose administration of elacestrant 176 mg. 
There were significant increases in AUC0–t (76%) and AUC0–∞ (83%) in the moderate hepatic 
impairment group (Child-Pugh B) compared to the normal hepatic function group. The Cmax values 
were similar between the normal and moderate impairment groups. 
The geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) tended to increase with increasing severity of hepatic 
impairment. Elacestrant has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh C). 
In PBPK modeling simulation of elacestrant at 345 mg, the steady state AUC and Cmax were predicted 
to increase by 2.14- and 1.92-fold, respectively, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Elacestrant displayed low acute toxicity. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, the 
antiestrogenic activity of elacestrant was responsible for the effects seen, particularly in the female 
reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones such as mammary gland, pituitary 
and testes. Sporadic emesis and diarrhoea were recorded in monkeys. In addition, in long-term studies 
(26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in cynomolgus monkeys), increased vacuolation of the mucosal 
epithelium of the non-glandular stomach were observed in rats and vacuolated macrophage infiltrates 
in the small intestine were recorded in both rats and monkeys. In monkeys this effect occurred at a 
level of systemic exposure of about 70% of the human exposure. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elacestrant showed no genotoxic potential in the Ames test, chromosomal aberrations in human 
lymphocytes and in the micronucleus assay in rats. 
Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted. In repeated-dose toxicity studies effects related to 
fertility were observed in rat and monkey female reproductive tract; these effects occurred below 
human exposures at MRHD (maximum recommended dose). Decreased cellularity of Leydig cells in 
rat testes was also observed at exposure levels 2.7-fold higher than in humans. 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats, oral administration of elacestrant resulted in maternal 
toxicity (body weight loss, low food consumption, red vulvar discharge) and increased resorptions, 
increased post-implantation loss, and reduced number of live foetuses and foetal variations and 
malformations below human exposures at MHRD.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ORSERDU is and what it is used for 
What ORSERDU is 
ORSERDU contains the active substance elacestrant which belongs to a group of medicines called 
selective estrogen receptor degraders. 
What ORSERDU is used for 
This medicine is used to treat postmenopausal women and adult men who have a specific type of 
breast cancer that is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). It can be used to 
treat breast cancer that is estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, meaning that the cancer cells have receptors 
for the hormone oestrogen on their surface, and that is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative, meaning that cancer cells have no or only a small amount of this receptor on their 
surface. ORSERDU is used as monotherapy (used on its own) in patients whose cancer has not 
responded to or progressed further following at least one line of hormonal treatment including a 
CDK 4/6 inhibitor and who have certain changes (mutations) in a gene called ESR1. 
Your doctor will take a sample of your blood, which will be tested for these ESR1 mutations. A 
positive result is required for initiation of treatment with ORSERDU. 
How ORSERDU works 
Oestrogen receptors are a group of proteins found inside the cells. They are activated when the 
hormone oestrogen binds to them. By binding to these receptors, oestrogen can in some cases 
stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. ORSERDU contains the active substance elacestrant that 
binds to the oestrogen receptors in the cancer cells and stops them from working. By blocking and 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
destroying oestrogen receptors, ORSERDU can reduce the growth and spread of breast cancer and 
help to kill cancer cells. 
If you have any questions about how ORSERDU works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. 
2.  What you need to know before you take ORSERDU 
Do not use ORSERDU if: 
- 
you are allergic to elacestrant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ORSERDU 
- 
if you have any liver disease (examples of liver disease include cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), 
liver impairment or cholestatic jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes due to a reduced flow 
of bile from the liver)). Your doctor will monitor you regularly and closely for adverse 
reactions. 
By having advanced breast cancer you may have an increased risk of developing blood clots in your 
veins (a type of blood vessel). It is unknown if ORSERDU also increases this risk. 
Children and adolescents 
ORSERDU should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and ORSERDU 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because ORSERDU can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some 
other medicines can affect the way ORSERDU works. 
Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: 
- 
antibiotics to treat bacterial infections (such as ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, 
rifampicin, telithromycin) 
medicine for low blood sodium (such as conivaptan) 
medicines to treat depression (such as nefazodone or fluvoxamine) 
medicine to treat anxiety and alcohol withdrawal (such as tofisopam). 
medicines for the treatment of other cancers (such as crizotinib, dabrafenib, imatinib, lorlatinib, 
or sotorasib) 
medicines for high blood pressure or chest pain (such as bosentan, diltiazem or verapamil) 
medicines for fungal infections (such as fluconazole, isavuconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole, or voriconazole) 
medicines for HIV infection (such as efavirenz, etravirine, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, 
nelfinavir, saquinavir, or telaprevir) 
medicines to treat irregular heartbeats (such as digoxin, dronedarone, or quinidine) 
medicines used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection (such as cyclosporine) 
medicines to prevent cardiovascular events and to treat high levels of cholesterol (such as 
rosuvastatin) 
medicines used to prevent seizures (such as carbamazepine, cenobamate, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, or primidone) 
medicines to treat vomiting (such as aprepitant) 
herbal medicines used to treat depression containing St. John’s wort

ORSERDU with food and drink 
Do not drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit while on treatment with ORSERDU as it may change 
the amount of ORSERDU in your body and increase the side effects of ORSERDU (see Section 3 
“How to take ORSERDU”. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
This medicine should only be used in postmenopausal women and in men. 
Pregnancy 
ORSERDU may harm an unborn baby. You must not take ORSERDU if you are pregnant, think you 
may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. If you think you may be pregnant or planning to have 
a baby, ask your doctor, or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you should use effective contraception while you are 
being treated with ORSERDU and for one week after stopping treatment with ORSERDU. Ask your 
doctor for suitable methods. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will rule out 
an existing pregnancy before starting you on treatment with ORSERDU. This may include having a 
pregnancy test. 
Breast-feeding 
You must not breast-feed while on treatment with ORSERDU and for one week after the last dose of 
ORSERDU. During treatment, your doctor will discuss the potential risks of taking ORSERDU during 
pregnancy or breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
ORSERDU may impair fertility in women and men. 
Driving and using machines 
ORSERDU has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, since 
fatigue, weakness, and difficulty sleeping have been reported in some patients taking elacestrant, 
caution should be observed by patients who experience those adverse reactions when driving or 
operating machinery. 
3. 
How to take ORSERDU 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
ORSERDU should be taken with food, just avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice during treatment with 
ORSERDU (see section 2 “ORSERDU with food and drink”). Taking ORSERDU with food may 
reduce nausea and vomiting. 
Take your dose of this medicine at approximately the same time each day. This will help you to 
remember to take your medicine. 
ORSERDU tablets should be swallowed whole. They should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to 
swallowing. Do not take a tablet that is broken, cracked or otherwise damaged. 
The recommended dose of ORSERDU is 345 mg (one 345 mg film-coated tablet) once daily. Your 
doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets to take. In certain situations (i.e. in case of liver 
problems, side effects, or if you are also using certain other medicines your doctor may instruct you to 
take a lower dose of ORSERDU, e.g. 258 mg (3 tablets of 86 mg) once daily, 172 mg (2 tablets of 
86 mg) once daily, or 86 mg (1 tablet of 86 mg) once daily. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you take more ORSERDU than you should 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you think you have accidentally taken more ORSERDU than you 
should. He or she will decide what to do. 
If you forget to take ORSERDU 
If you forget to take a dose of ORSERDU, take it as soon as you remember. You may still take a 
forgotten dose up to 6 hours after the time you should have taken it. If more than 6 hours have passed 
or if you vomit after taking the dose, skip the dose for that day and take the next dose at your usual 
time the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up for the one that you missed. 
If you stop taking ORSERDU 
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. If treatment with 
ORSERDU is stopped, your condition may worsen. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

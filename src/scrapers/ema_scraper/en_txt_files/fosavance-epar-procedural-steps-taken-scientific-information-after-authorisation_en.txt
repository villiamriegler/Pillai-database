add ‘atypical fractures of other bones’ as a new ADR

information about the risk of ‘atypical

based on post-marketing case reports and literature. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In

minor editorial changes and to bring the product

subtrochanteric and diaphyseal long bone fractures 
(bisphosphonate class adverse reaction) remains rare. 
Atypical fractures of other bones, such as the ulna and tibia 
have also been reported in patients receiving long-term 
treatment. As with atypical femoral fractures, these 
fractures occur after minimal, or no trauma and some 
patients experience prodromal pain prior to presenting with 
a completed fracture. In cases of ulna fracture, this may be 
associated with repetitive stress loading associated with the 
long-term use of walking aids.

Product Characteristics.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
21/05/2010

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II and PL 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Fosavance 
remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to 
be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
There are a number of ongoing safety issues for 
alendronate for which post-marketing studies are ongoing 
or planned, the results of which are expected to yield 
important new safety data which could impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of the product. These studies pertain to 
oesophageal adverse effects and stress fractures.  In 
particular for stress fractures, there are significant 
uncertainties at present, and more information should 
become available in the next 5 years. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Fosavance, 
which requires the submission of 3-yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

of alendronate and oesophageal carcinoma, the CHMP 
concluded that Barrett's oesophagus is a potentially 
premalignant condition of the oesophagus and a significant 
marker for the development of oesophageal cancer.  
Although the data are currently inconclusive and further

Therefore Barrett's oesophagus was included as a warning

Clarification on the need to swallow the tablet as a whole,

introduced in section 4.4. In addition, section 4.7 was 
updated following certain adverse drug reactions which 
may affect ability to drive. Furthermore, section  4.5 was 
updated to include that  caution should be used during 
concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) with alendronate due to an increased risk of 
serious upper GI complications in patients taking NSAIDs 
and alendronate concomitantly, and in section  4.8

July 1993) to 31 January 2008 the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder has received a total of 1720 spontaneous adverse 
reaction reports of alopecia in association with alendronate. 
A total of 224 reports had evidence of recovery/recovering 
upon discontinuation of alendronate therapy, including 23 
reports in which patients restarted alendronate therapy and 
the condition recurred. The reported adverse events were 
generally characterised by diffuse loss of scalp hair 1-2 
months after initiation of alendronate therapy. As an 
improvement or full recovery upon discontinuation of 
alendronate therapy was observed in some of the cases, 
the CHMP considered that a causal relationship between 
alopecia and alendronate therapy cannot be excluded and

osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in association with 
bisphosphonates in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
indicated that periodontal disease is a risk factor for 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) associated with 
bisphosphonates. Periodontal disease was found in a subset 
of the patients in a review of spontaneous cases reported 
with alendronate. A total of 147 spontaneous reports of 
ONJ in association with alendronate sodium and 
alendronate sodium/colecalciferol were identified. In 48 of 
these reports the patients had periodontal disease and/or 
other concurrent oral conditions including gum disorders 
and ill-fitting dentures. The CHMP therefore agreed to 
update the SPC to include periodontal disease as a risk 
factor for ONJ

The overall risk-benefit is considered to be 
favourable. Given the importance of adequate 
vitamin D status in osteoporotic patients, and the 
evidence of a high incidence of vitamin D 
insufficiency in osteoporotic patients, this treatment 
would simplify therapy and help to prevent vitamin D

reduce the risk of vitamin D deficiency in risk patient 
groups including the elderly. The overall risk-benefit is

satisfactory safety profile of the combination tablet,

the need for prior assessment of vitamin D status. 
The Product Information of the 70 mg/5600 IU

adverse events observed in PSUR 2 (dizziness, vertigo, 
joint swelling, asthenia and peripheral oedema). The results 
confirmed the need to include them in the PI, however as 
these adverse events originated from post-authorisation 
spontaneous reporting, the frequency of these adverse 
events based on clinical or post marketing studies, the 
frequencies of these events were considered as "unknown". 
This variation also updated the SPC to include information 
about osteonecrosis of the jaw following the use of 
alendronate in section 4.4 and section 4.8 as requested by 
the CHMP.  
A signal of risk of maxillofacial osteonecrosis associated 
with the administration of bisphosphonates was identified in 
literature and via spontaneous reporting. Therefore, the 
PhVWP agreed to perform a class review to further 
investigate a possible causal relationship. 
Concerning alendronate, 78 cases have been reported from 
the time of market introduction (1993) to June 2005, which 
corresponded to a patient exposure of 12.9 million patient 
treatment years. Female gender, advanced age, malignant 
disease and a location to the mandible were considered 
prevailing characteristics of the cases. In line with the 
PhVWP recommendation on bisphosphonates and 
osteonecrosis of the jaw, the MAH updated the Product 
Information.

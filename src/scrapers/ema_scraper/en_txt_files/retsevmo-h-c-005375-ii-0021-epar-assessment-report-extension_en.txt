Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for selpercatinib as monotherapy for adults with advanced 
RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer without prior standard first line therapy (i.e. first-line setting).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 7/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, the MAH is seeking an extension of indication for selpercatinib as monotherapy for 
adolescents (≥ 12 years of age) with advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer (i.e. first and later 
line). 
Epidemiology  
The thyroid follicle-derived, differentiated cancers (papillary thyroid cancer [PTC] and follicular thyroid 
cancer [FTC]) are the most common thyroid cancers, accounting for 80% to 85% and 10% to 15% of all 
thyroid cancer cases, respectively (Aboelnaga and Ahmed 2015). Poorly differentiated subtypes [PDTC] 
and anaplastic thyroid cancer [ATC]) account for 5% to 10% of thyroid cancers and are characterized by 
less differentiated histologic features and more aggressive clinical behaviour than the differentiated 
subtypes (Landa 2016). 
RET gene fusions have been identified in approximately 6% to 9% of PTCs and approximately 6% of 
PDTCs (Fusco 1987; Agrawal 2013; Cancer Genome Atlas Research 2014; Kato 2017; Landa 2016). In 
contrast to PTC and PDTC, neither FTC nor ATC are frequently associated with RET gene fusions. Most 
differentiated thyroid cancers, including PTC, are largely asymptomatic, treatable tumours with an 
excellent prognosis after surgical resection and radioiodine therapy (Pacini et al., 2012).  
In Europe, an estimated 53,000 patients developed thyroid cancer in 2012.  Assuming 84% of those 
cases were PTC (44,520), and assuming RET- fusion gene alterations, according to more recent data 
(Santoro 2020), are present in 11% of PTC patients the incidence of new cases of RET- fusion positive 
PTC was approximately 4900 per year (ENRC 2019; Roskoski and Sadeghi-Nejad 2018). 
Although extremely rare, the most common form of thyroid cancer in children is PTC. In addition, children 
with differentiated thyroid cancer have a higher prevalence of gene rearrangements (Segni et al. 2017). 
Thyroid carcinomas occurring in children carry a unique set of clinical, pathologic, and molecular 
characteristics. 
Biologic features 
Genetic alterations in the RET gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers. 
RET can become oncogenically activated through two primary mechanisms: 1) chromosomal 
rearrangements that fuse the RET kinase domain with a partner protein dimerization domain (e.g., 
Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 6 (CCDC6)/papillary thyroid cancer-1 (PTC1), Kinesin Family 
Member 5B (KIF5B), NCOA4/PTC3), producing hybrid proteins that endow the kinase with ligand-
independent, constitutive activity; and 2) point mutations that directly or indirectly activate the kinase 
(Drilon et al. 2018). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical course of RET fusion-positive PTC is heterogeneous, varying from some tumours being cured 
by surgical resection to aggressive cancers associated with metastases and high mortality.  Recurrent 
disease is treated with reoperation and/or radioactive iodine therapy. However, these treatments are 
associated with significant morbidity and are often not curative. 
In comparison to adults, children more often present with aggressive, advanced stage disease. This is at 
least in part due to the underlying biologic and molecular differences between paediatric and adult thyroid 
cancer. Specifically, papillary thyroid carcinoma (which accounts for approximately 90% of paediatric 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 8/76 
 
 
 
 
 
thyroid cancer) has a high rate of gene fusions (50-60%, compared to approximately 15% seen in adults) 
and are associated with more extensive extrathyroidal disease (Starenki and Park 2015).   
The prognosis is favourable for the papillary and follicular subtypes of thyroid cancer, as they are slower-
growing, indolent and rarely fatal cancers, as evidenced by the high 5-year relative survival in the 
EUROCARE-5 study (greater than 95% in PTC and 87% in follicular thyroid cancer (Dal Maso et al. 2017). 
In the US, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic PTC is 78% compared to 99% for localised cancer 
(ASCO 2019). 
Management 
Patients with RET fusion-positive PTC or PDTC receive standard of care for their thyroid cancer subtype. 
Standard treatment options for PTC, include surgery and radioactive iodine (RAI) (Nguyen et al. 2015).  
PDTC is less responsive to radioactive iodine than PTC. Paediatric patients with PTC are also treated with 
surgical resection and RAI therapy, although the specifics of RAI are somewhat different in this population 
(Paulson et al. 2019).    
No systemic agents are approved specifically for patients with advanced RET-fusion thyroid cancer.   
Two available multikinase inhibitors (MKIs), sorafenib and lenvatinib, are approved for the treatment of 
unresectable, iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, irrespective of the presence or absence of a 
RET mutation. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Selpercatinib  is  an  inhibitor  of  the  rearranged  during  transfection  (RET)  receptor  tyrosine  kinase 
(including KIF5B-RET and CCDC6-RET). 
RETSEVMO (Selpercatinib) was granted a CMA on 11 Feb 2021.  
As of today the approved indications are 1) the treatment of advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC in adult 
patients not previously treated with a RET inhibitor, 2) advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who 
require systemic therapy following prior treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib and 3) advanced RET-
mutant MTC in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. 
The conditional MA was approved based on ORR and DOR observed in the ongoing Phase 1/2 study, 
LIBRETTO-001. 
The presence of a RET gene fusion or mutation should be confirmed by a validated test prior to initiation 
of treatment with Retsevmo. 
The recommended dose of Retsevmo based on body weight is: 
-Less than 50 kg: 120 mg twice daily. 
-50 kg or greater: 160 mg twice daily. 
If  a  patient  vomits  or  misses  a  dose,  the  patient  should  be  instructed  to  take  the  next  dose  at  its 
scheduled time; an additional dose should not be taken.  
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The applied indication is: 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Evaluation of clinical safety and efficacy of selpercatinib in patients with RET fusion-positive tissue is 
based on the analysis of interim data from LIBRETTO-001 (LOXORET- 17001; J2G-OX-JZJA) and 
LIBRETTO-121 Study. LIBRETTO-001 is a global, multicohort, open-label, phase 1/2 study in adult and 
adolescent with advanced RET-altered tumours. LIBRETTO-121 is a multicentre, open-label, Phase 1/2 
study in paediatric patients with an advanced solid or primary central nervous system tumour harbouring, 
an activating RET alteration.

Prevalence of Currently Authorised Indications 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 11/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Selpercatinib is currently authorised for patients with thyroid cancer (medullary, papillary, and other 
subtypes) and lung cancer (NSCLC subtype), specifically those that have activated RET through 
alterations of the RET gene such as fusions and mutations. Patients tested for gene alterations and only 
those positive can be dosed with selpercatinib. 
The prevalence of the indications for selpercatinib was derived from the prevalence of each cancer type in 
each EU member state using 3-year prevalence data (IARC, accessed 2022) and then refined for the 
frequency of the indicated cancer subtypes and the frequency of activated RET in that subtype. The 3-
year prevalence data was used instead of 1-year data because some patients may have been treated with 
selpercatinib longer than one year. Cancer prevalence was not adjusted for cancer stage or whether 
patients have received prior treatment with other cancer medicine or for use in only adults with the 
cancer, these assumptions will also result in conservatism in the PEC calculations. 
Since the PECsurface water was greater than 0.01 µg∙L-1, a Phase II risk assessment has been 
conducted. Summary of the main study results are presented below.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Selpercatinib  is  an  orally  available,  highly  selective,  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)-competitive  small 
molecule inhibitor of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase.  
In Europe selpercatinib is available as two strengths of hard capsules, 40 and 80 mg. 
Selpercatinib is orally administered and the recommended dose is based on body weight:  
• 
• 
Less than 50 kg: 120 mg twice daily.  
50 kg or greater: 160 mg twice daily.  
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of selpercatinib were sufficiently characterized in the initial MAA 
(EMEA/H/C/005375/0000)  
The PK data provided in support of this submission includes: 
• 
Descriptive  analysis  of  selpercatinib  non-compartmental  PK  data  from  adult  patients  with  RET 
fusion-positive  TC  (with  or  without  previous  systemic  therapy  other  than  radioactive  iodine)

PK data in Adolescent patients with thyroid cancer 
At the time of the current submission, no data in adolescent patients were present in the ongoing pivotal 
studyLOXO-RET-17001 LIBRETTO-001 in the advanced RET fusion-positive TC population. 
As of 08 May 2022, 6 patients with RET fusion-positive TC aged 12 to 18 years have been treated in 
Study LIBRETTO 121 however no PK data were analysed and available: These include: 
•  4 patients aged 12 years 
•  1 patient aged 15 years, and 
•  1 patient aged 17 years. 
During the procedure PK data from 19 evaluable paediatric patients ≥ 12 years old were provided from 
the ongoing pivotal paediatric Study LIBRETTO-121 (data available up 13 January 2023)  
Table 5. Selpercatinib Pharmocokinatics and Demographics in paediatric Patients in study LIBRETTO-121 
Aged 12 years and older Stratified by Actual administered dose amount at cycle 1 Day 8  
The applicant provided PK data in 4 paediatric patients (aged 13 months through 10 years) treated in the 
setting of single-patient compassionate use protocols and who received the dose of 90 mg/m2 BID up to 
a maximum of 160 mg BID. 
According to the Applicant, steady-state exposure of these paediatric patients Table 6 were well within 
the variability band of exposures in adults patients in LIBRETTO-001 given 160 mg BID (geometric mean 
Cmax of 3050 ng/mL and geometric CV% of 51.4%, geometric mean AUC0-24 of 52600 ng*h/mL, and 
geometric CV% 55.5%).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  the  current  submission,  the  applicant  claims  an  extension  of  indication  for  selpercatinib  in  advanced 
RET fusion-positive TC to include treatment in a first-line setting and to include adolescent patients ≥12 
years.   
For the purpose of first-line treatment in adults, updated PK data in adult TC patients from the pivotal 
study LOXO-RET-17001were provided. Of the 757 patients with evaluable PK data in the ongoing pivotal 
study LOXO-RET-17001 (data available up to 10 June 2021), 51 patients had TC but only PK data from 39 
patients were provided. 
Using  a  Noncompartmental  analysis  (NCA)  approach,  PK  exposure  parameters  at  steady-state  (AUC0-
24h,  Cmax)  were  determined  from  RET  fusion-positive  TC  patients  naïve  to  previous  systemic  therapy 
(n=16) and TC patients previously treated with systemic therapy (n=23). Overall,  steady state systemic 
exposure  of  selpercatinib  in  patients  with  TC  naïve  vs  those  with  prior  systemic  therapy  appears  to  be 
similar. The geometric means of steady state PK parameters on selpercatinib in naïve TC patients (n=16, 
Cmax  =  2880  ng/mL  and  AUC0-24h  =  52900  ng.h/mL)  were  slightly  lower  (15  and  13%,  respectively) 
than  those  in  TC  patients  with  prior  systemic  therapy  (n=23,  Cmax  =  3400  ng/mL  and  AUC0-24h  = 
61000 ng.h/mL) and their 95% CI substantially overlapped.  
The provided PK results in TC patients indicate that steady-state PK following 160 mg BID administration 
for patients with RET fusion-positive TC appears overall similar to those already reported for patients with 
NSCLC  and  MTC  (geometric  means  of  Cmax  between  2630  and  3600  ng/mL  and  AUC0-24h  between 
45500  to  64000  ng.h/mL).  Therefore  from  a  PK  perspective,  the  recommendation  of  the  same  dosing 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 18/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regimen,  as  reported  in  the  current  product  information,  for  the  first-line  setting  in  patients  with  TC  is 
supported.   
For the purpose  of extension indication in adolescent  patients  the  PK data from  19 evaluable  paediatric 
patients with age 12 years or older (data available up 13 January 2023) were provided from the ongoing 
pivotal paediatric Study LIBRETTO-121. Using the NCA approach, , the geometric means of steady-state 
(C1D8) selpercatinib systemic exposures in adolescents ≥12 years old receiving a 92 mg/m2 dosing (n= 
19,  Cmax  =  3530  ng/mL  and  AUC0-24h  =  57000  ng.h/mL)  were  in  a  similar  range  (15  and  7%, 
respectively higher) compared to those observed in adult patients with cancer treated with 160 mg BID in 
the pivotal Study LOXO-RET-17001 (n= 646, Cmax = 3060 ng/mL and AUC0-24h = 53000 ng.h/mL) and 
the distributions of Cmax and AUC0-24h largely overlapped. Importantly, the 92 mg/m2 BID dosing used 
in pediatric patients ≥12 years old turns to nominal administered doses of 120 to 160 mg BID, which is in 
line with the actually recommended doses in adults.  
Furthermore, when analysed by dose level,  paediatric patients ≥12 years old, body weight <50 kg, and 
administered dose  of 120 mg BID  (n= 5)  had  comparable systemic exposures at steady state (Cmax = 
3910ng/mL  and  AUC0-24h  =  61800  ng.h/mL)  with  paediatric  patients  ≥12  years  old,  body  weight  >50 
kg, and administered dose of 160 mg BID (n = 9, Cmax = 3310 ng/mL and AUC0-24h = 52900 ng.h/mL) 
as  well  adult  patients  with  160  mg  BID.  Overall,  based  on  these  results,  the  systemic  exposure  on 
selpercatinib  at  steady  state  in  adolescent  patients  ≥12  years  old  receiving  the  actual  recommended 
weight-based dosing regimen for adults [120 mg BID in patients below 50 kg and 160 mg BID in patients 
who are at least 50 kg] is expected to be similar to that observed in the already approved adult patients 
(160 mg BID). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No significant difference in PK characteristics of selpercatinib is observed in  naïve RET fusion-positive TC 
patients compared to those previously treated with systemic therapy. Therefore, from a PK perspective, 
the claim to extend selpercatinib indication to first-line setting in adult TC patients is agreed.  
Based on interim PK from 19 evaluable paediatric patients with age 12 years or older (data available up 
13  January  2023)  issued  from  the  ongoing  pivotal  pediatric  Study  LIBRETTO-121  data,  the  systemic 
exposure  on  selpercatinib  at  steady  state  in  adolescent  patients  ≥12  years  old  administered  the  actual 
recommended  weight-based  dosing  regimen  in  adults  was  found  to  be  in  as  similar  range  to  that 
observed  in  adult  patients  with  cancer.  Therefore,  from  a  PK  perspective,  the  claim  to  extend 
selpercatinib indication to adolescents ≥12 years old is agreed.

Title of Study 
LIBRETTO-001 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 19/76 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods 
LIBRETTO-001 is a first in human Phase 1/2, multicentre, single-arm, multicohort, open-label, dose-
escalation study in patients aged 12 years or older with advanced solid tumours, including RET fusion-
positive solid tumours, RET-mutant MTC, and other tumours with RET activation. 
As a note, the LIBRETTO-001 study has been the basis to support the following indications: 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with:  
- 
advanced RET fusion positive non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated 
with a RET inhibitor 
- 
advanced RET fusion positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and 
older with advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). 
The study includes 2 parts: 
- Phase 1 (dose escalation and expansion) and 
- Phase 2 (dose expansion). 
After completion of the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion, the Phase 2 dose expansion to enrol patients 
with RET fusion-positive or RET-mutant cancers was initiated. Phase 2 cohorts were defined based on 
disease characteristics and patient history, for example, measurable or non-measurable disease, prior 
systemic therapy or systemic therapy naïve. Patients contributing to the RET fusion-positive TC 
population come from both Phases 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study. Assessments and by IRC 
(Independent Review Committee) and by Investigator were planned to be included.

 Phase I dose escalation part 
Study participants 
Eligibility criteria at the time of this interim report was specified as per protocol Version 9.0. (15 June 
2021 data cut-off). 
Main selection criteria for phase 1 were: 
Inclusion Criteria  
● Patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor who: 
- have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapy, or 
- no standard therapy exists, or in the opinion of the Investigator, are not candidates for or would 
be unlikely to tolerate or derive significant clinical benefit from standard therapy, or 
- decline standard therapy. 
● Prior MKIs with anti-RET activity were allowed. 
● A RET gene alteration was not required initially. Once adequate PK exposure was achieved, evidence of 
RET gene alteration in tumor and/or blood was required (e.g., gene rearrangement and/or mutation, 
excluding synonymous, frameshift, or nonsense mutations) as identified through molecular assays, as 
performed for clinical evaluation. The RET alteration result should have been generated from a laboratory 
with CLIA, ISO/IEC, CAP or other similar certification. The Sponsor should have been contacted to discuss 
test results from labs where such certification was not clearly demonstrated to determine eligibility. 
● Measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO as appropriate to tumor 
type. 
● At least 18 years of age. 
- For countries and sites where approved, patients as young as 12 years of age could be enrolled. 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 (age ≥ 16 years) or 
Lansky Performance Score (LPS) ≥ 40% (age < 16 years) with no sudden deterioration 2 weeks prior to 
the first dose of study treatment. 
● Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 
Exclusion Criteria for Phase 1 
• 
an additional validated oncogenic driver that could cause resistance to selpercatinib treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Phase 1 primary objective  
The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of LIBRETTO-001 was to determine the MTD and 
recommended Phase 2 dose of selpercatinib. A dose of 160 mg BID was selected for Phase 2.(please ref 
to sectino 2.3.4) 
Phase 2 dose expansion part  
Inclusion Criteria for Phase 2 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 21/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inclusion Criteria are the same as for Phase 1, with the following modifications: 
● Cohorts 1 and 3: failed or intolerant to standard of care; Cohorts 2 and 4: without prior standard-first 
line therapy. 
Table 7. Standard of Care Therapies for Cohorts 1-4 
● Cohorts 1-4: enrollment was to be restricted to patients with evidence of a RET gene alteration in tumor 
(i.e., not just blood) as defined in Table 7. However, a positive germline DNA test for a RET gene 
mutation as defined in Table 7 was acceptable in the absence of tumor tissue testing for patients with 
MTC. 
● Cohorts 1-4: at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO, as appropriate to tumor 
type and not previously irradiated (unless PD for the irradiated lesion[s] has been radiographically 
documented). 
● Cohort 4: radiographic Progression Disease within the previous 14 months. 
● Cohort 6: patients otherwise eligible for Cohorts 1-5 who discontinued another selective RET inhibitor(s) 
due to intolerance may be eligible with prior Sponsor approval. 
Exclusion Criteria for Phase 2 
● Phase 2 Cohorts 1-4: an additional validated oncogenic driver that could cause resistance to 
selpercatinib treatment.

Treatments 
The recommended Phase 2 dose of 160 mg twice daily (BID) was selected in Phase 1 and has been used 
as the starting dose for patients in the ongoing Phase 2 dose expansion. 
Details of selpercatinib administration remained the same as for the authorized indication in second line 
of treatment of RET-fusion advance or metastatic TC.   
Individual patients continued selpercatinib dosing until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 
other reason for treatment discontinuation. 
Patients with progressive disease could continue selpercatinib if the patient was deriving clinical benefit 
from continuing selpercatinib, as determined by the Investigator and if continuation of selpercatinib was 
approved by the Sponsor. 
Objectives 
Please see the outcomes and endpoints section. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following table lists the objectives and endpoints for the Phase 2 part of the study as per protocol 
Version 9.0.

Sample size 
For Phase 2, For Cohort 2 a true ORR of ≥ 55% was hypothesized when selpercatinib was administered to 
patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumors without prior standard first-line therapy. A sample size of 
59 patients was estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-sided 95% exact 
binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 35%. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable, this is a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy analyses was to be conducted on all treated patients unless otherwise specified. 
Patients with RET fusion-positive TC who had received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib and achieved at 
least 6 months of potential follow-up time from the first dose of selpercatinib (or disease progression or 
death, whichever occurred first), as of 15 June 2021, were considered eligible for efficacy analyses. 
Response were to be assessed approximately every 2 months. Six (6) months of follow-up provides 
sufficient time for initial responses to be confirmed. 
ORR was to be assessed using RECIST 1.1. The estimate of the ORR was to be calculated based on the 
maximum likelihood estimator (i.e., crude proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR 
that are confirmed based on RECIST 1.1). The estimate of the ORR was to be accompanied by 2-sided CIs 
with various coverage probabilities (e.g., 80%, 95%). 
The analysis of ORR was to be conducted both by the responses determined by each Investigator and 
responses as determined by IRC. 
This interim CSR follows the SAP Version 1.0 7 August 2019. 
Measures to Minimise Bias 
This study included an IRC for efficacy assessments in addition to the Investigator assessments. The 
primary radiography imaging files from LIBRETTO-001 were sent to a third-party vendor for central 
review.

Missing data 
Unless noted otherwise, missing data was not to be imputed. All analyses were planned to be  based on 
observed data only. The effective sample sizes at each assessment visit were planned to be based on the 
total number of patients with non-missing data for the parameter of interest at that visit. 
This interim CSR follows the SAP Version 1.0 7 August 2019 which does not specify the analysis for the 
subset RET Fusion-Positive TC without prior systemic treatment. 
Results 
LIBRETTO-001 is currently ongoing and continues to enrol patients with advanced solid tumours. 
Data presented below are from LIBRETTO-001, as of a data cutoff date of 15 June 2021 and data cutoff 
date of 13 January 2023, in patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive TC. 
Participant flow 
At the data cutoff date, 15 June 2021 921 patients were screened. Of these, 123 patients were screen 
failures, and 2 patients were in screening. 
Overall, 796 patients from both Phase 1 cohorts and Phase 2 dose-expansion cohorts were treated with at 
least 1 dose of selpercatinib as of the data cut-off date.  
54 patients with RET fusion-positive TC from Phase 1 and Phase 2 Cohorts 1, 2, 5, and 6 were considered 
as part of the TC safety analysis dataset. 
The evaluation of efficacy consists of RET fusion-positive TC analysis sets includes patients enrolled into 
Phase 2 Cohorts 1, 2, and 5. 
The efficacy analysis for RET fusion-positive TC primarily focused on: 
1. patients not previously treated with systemic therapy other than RAI nr 16 (primary efficacy analysis 
set) and 
2. patients previously treated with systemic therapy nr 30 (supportive efficacy analysis set). 
A total of 46 patients with RET fusion-positive TC were considered eligible for efficacy analyses, among 
them 16 patients were not previously treated with systemic therapy other than RAI (TC:TrtSysNaïve)

Of the 16 TC:TrtSysNaïve patients, 81.3% were still on treatment. The main reason for treatment 
discontinuation was: 
● progressive disease (1 [6.3%]), 
● withdrawal of consent (1 [6.3%]), or 
● other (1 [6.3%]): withdrawal of consent for greater convenience.

Supportive Efficacy Analysis Set from TC:TrtSys patients 
Patients with RET Fusion-Positive TC Previously Treated with Systemic Therapy Other Than RAI 
At the DCO 13 January 2023  TC:TrtSys patients (N = 41)  had an ORR of 85.4% (95% CI: 70.8, 94.4). 
With a median response follow-up time of 33.9 months for the 35 responders, the median DOR estimated 
by the IRC was 26.7 months (95% CI: 12.1, NE), which demonstrates that selpercatinib provides robust 
and durable responses. The estimated rate of DOR was 71.7% at 12 months and  50.7% at 24 months. 
The  median  time  to  response  by  the  IRC  assessment  was  1.8  months,  with  71.4%  of  patients 
demonstrating an initial response at the first post-baseline radiographic assessment.  
The  median  PFS  estimate  reached  27.4  months  (95%  CI:  14.5,  NE),  with  a  median  follow-up  of  30.4 
months. The median OS was not reached.

Design 
Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
This is a multicentre, open-label, Phase 1/2 study in paediatric and adolescent 
patients with advanced solid or primary CNS tumours harbouring an activating 
RET alteration. Selpercatinib is administered as an oral liquid suspension or in 
capsule form BID, with dose escalation according to evaluations of safety, 
efficacy, and PK, with a body surface area-based dose in all cohorts. 
This study is ongoing and includes 2 parts: Phase 1 (dose escalation and dose 
expansion) and Phase 2 (dose expansion). The primary objective of the Phase 1 
portion of LIBRETTO-121 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and 
recommended Phase 2 dose of selpercatinib. The Phase 2 portion will open 
enrolment when the MTD/ RP2D is confirmed and will enrol patients into one of 
4 cohorts. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion is to determine the ORR 
based on RECIST 1.1 or RANO as appropriate to tumour type as determined by 
an IRC. 
The disease criteria for each cohort is as follows 
•  Cohort 1: RET fusion-positive solid tumour (excluding CNS primary) 
with measurable disease 
•  Cohort 2: RET-mutant MTC with measurable disease 
•  Cohort 3: RET fusion-positive primary CNS tumour with measurable 
disease 
•  Cohort 4: Any patient with RET mutation/alteration not fitting Cohort 1 
to 3 criteria (that is, RET alterations via plasma cfDNA or non-CLIA 
certified test, measurable, or non-measurable disease). 
Duration of main phase: 
The study is ongoing. Patients are to be treated 
until there is evidence of until progressive 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason 
for treatment discontinuation. 
Exploratory: 
For Cohorts 1 and 2, a sample size of 20 patients is estimated to provide 
approximately 75% power to achieve a lower boundary of a 2-sided 95% exact 
binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 20%. Ruling out a lower 
limit of 20% is considered clinically meaningful in patients who have limited 
treatment options for their advancing disease. Cohorts 3-4 are anticipated to 
enrol too few patients to be powered for a formal statistical testing.

2.4.1.  Paediatric Extrapolation 
The justification of the extrapolation of Adult Data to Adolescents provided by the MAH is presented 
below: 
RET is an oncogenic driver, and it is expected that therapeutic benefit of a selective RET inhibitor would 
be independent of age. For targeted cancer therapies, clinical outcomes for adolescent patients could be 
extrapolated from clinical trials with predominant enrolment of adult patients as the clinical outcomes are 
primarily related to the molecular basis of cancer, their associated pathways and PK responses. It is 
believed that medications designed for some cancers in adults may affect the same pathways in childhood 
and adolescent cancers (Paulson et al. 2019). 
No patients with RET fusion-positive TC aged 18 years or less were identified for participation in 
LIBRETTO-001. Lilly is using an extrapolation approach from adults to adolescents aged 12 years and 
above based upon supportive evidence included from the available efficacy and safety data from 
LIBRETTO-121, and PK data from single-patient compassionate use protocols. A similar pattern of efficacy 
has been demonstrated with other agents that target oncogenic drivers. Related to this, it is important to 
note that the RET fusion partners identified in tumours from patients in LIBRETTO-121 were also 
identified in the tumours seen from LIBRETTO -001. As oncogenic RET fusions seem to be more prevalent 
in the paediatric DTC patients, treatment with a selective RET inhibitor has been of interest (Paulson et al. 
2019). A similar approach was followed for the selpercatinib MTC indication, which has recently been 
authorised for the indication in adolescent patients aged 12 years and above based on data from 3 
adolescent patients in LIBRETTO-001 and from extrapolation of adult data. 
To enable an efficacy assessment based on the concept of extrapolation with supportive evidence from 
the available efficacy and safety analysis from LIBRETTO-121, it is necessary that there is an optimal 
consideration that the biology of disease, treatment (including targeted treatment), PK exposure, and 
unmet need are similar for adolescents and adults. The key considerations for justifying the extrapolation 
of adult data to adolescents aged 12 years and above have been presented as follows: 
Pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib in paediatric patients 
Evidence from literature shows that adolescents and young adults most commonly demonstrate similar 
PK responses to adult patients (Bernstein 2011). Based on PK results of paediatric patients treated with 
selpercatinib in single-patient compassionate use protocols (Section 2.5.3), the PK of selpercatinib in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 53/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paediatric patients are similar with the PK results observed in adult patients. No PK data have yet been 
analysed from LIBRETTO-121. 
Need for targeted therapeutic options in paediatric patients 
Although the occurrence of TC is rare in children and adolescents, DTC in children and adolescents often 
follows a more aggressive clinical course when compared with adults. This could be attributed to the 
disparities observed in the molecular and clinicopathological characteristics observed between adolescent 
and adult TCs as well as the presence of more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis in children 
(Paulson et al. 2019). 
For adult patients who have RAI-refractory DTC and have exhausted local treatment options, the next 
step of treatment is with systemic multi-targeted therapies, such as lenvatinib, sorafenib and 
cabozantinib. However, none of these systemic therapies is approved in paediatric patients less than 18 
years of age. There is a need for additional treatment options, especially, targeted treatment agents. 
Extrapolation conclusion 
In conclusion, based on the observed efficacy and safety in patients aged 12 years and above with RET 
fusion-positive TC from LIBRETTO-121, the available PK data, mechanism of action of selpercatinib and 
the high and similar unmet need in both adult and adolescent patients with TC, it is considered that the 
efficacy and safety data from LIBRETTO-001 in adult patients can be extrapolated to adolescent patients. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The provided efficacy data in support of the currently intended indication “treatment of adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older with advanced RET mutant thyroid cancer without prior standard first line 
therapy (i.e. first-line setting) is based on results from the ongoing study LOXO-RET-17001 (LIBRETTO-
001) as of the cut-off date (DCO) of 21 June 2021 which was updated during the procedure with DCO 13 
January 2023. This is an open-label, multicentre, phase 1/2 study which consisted of a dose escalation 
phase (phase 1) to determine the MTD and RP2D of selpercatinib followed by a Phase 2 expansion with 
diverse RET-altered cancer cohorts (6 cohorts), among them Thyroid Cancer in first line (cohort 2), and 
other tumours.  
The Phase 1 portion of the study has been completed. The Phase 2 portion is ongoing. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
LIBRETTO-001 is non-randomized and non-blinded single arm study. The absence of a control arm is an 
important limitation and a source of bias for a confirmatory study.  
Overall, inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered acceptable.  
In agreement with the PIP, Selection criteria allowed to include patients between 12 and 18 years old of 
age (in 4 countries) but no paediatric patients were enrolled in the study.  
The  primary  endpoint,  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  based  on  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC) 
assessment using RECIST v1.1,  is acceptable. The secondary endpoints (i.e. ORR based on Investigator 
assessment, TTR, TTBR, DoR, CBR, PFS and OS) are relevant.  
Regarding the statistical analysis plan, while a sample size has been well defined for the whole Cohort 2, 
no minimum  recruitment has been defined  specifically  for the TC subset. This  represents a limitation to 
the interpretation of the results of the study. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/60663/2024 
Page 54/76 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the SAP is acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 921 patients were screened and 796 were enrolled in the pivotal Study LIBRETTO-001. Of these 
786,  54  had  a  RET  Fusion-Positive  Thyroid  Cancer  (TC).  Among  them,  46  were  included  in  the  Efficacy 
Analysis Set, 16 patients in the TC:TrtSysNaïve population (without previous systemic treatment) and 30 
in the TC:TrtSys (with previous systemic treatment).  
Overall, the TC:TrtSysNaïve population remains very limited (i.e. 16) and while it is understood that RET 
Fusion-Positive TC  is not common, it  is however  only the half  of the TC:TrtSys  population.  Data from  8 
additional  patients  with  RET  Fusion-Positive  TC  without  prior  systemic  treatment  have  been  provided 
during the assessment with a cut-off date 13 January 2023 bringing the TC:TrtSysNaïve population to 24 
patients. 
The demographics appears consistent with the condition. The median age was  60.5 years (range: 20 to 
84  years),  58.3%  of  all  patients  were  male.  Additionally,  the  demographics  does  not  present  dramatics 
differences with the TC:TrtSys (with previous systemic treatment) population included in LIBRETTO-001. 
The most represented histology TC subtype was papillary TC followed (n=15), and only 1 patient had a 
poorly  differentiated  TC  which  is  consistent  with  the  epidemiology  of  the  disease.  Patients  were  in  a 
relatively good condition with 56.3% (n=9) of the patients with an ECOG of 0 and 37.5% (n=6) with an 
ECOG of 1, and only 1 patient with an ECOG of 2. Additionally, 93.8% (n=15) had a Stage IV disease (IV 
or IVB or IVC), and 100% (n=16) had a metastatic disease, which is in line with claimed indication (i.e. 
advance or metastatic cancer). No patients had received previous systemic therapy other than radioactive 
iodine. 
The  ORR  at  the  first  DCO  was  93.8%  (95%CI:  69.8,  99.8)  as  assessed  by  the  IRC  and  was  consistent 
with the ORR as assessed by Investigators 81.3% (95%CI: 54.4, 96.0). This level of response is seen as 
promising. Additionally, while the CI interval is broad, the low boundaries remain at a reasonable level of 
effect.  Moreover,  these  results  are  consistent  with  those  observed  in  second  line  setting  (i.e.  ORR 
assessed by IRC: 80.0% (95%CI: 61.4, 92.3). 
According to the IRC, at the data cut-off of 21 June 2021, 31.3% (n=5) of the patients had a CR, 62.5% 
(n=10) a PR, and 6.3% (n=1) SD16+, for a clinical benefit rate of 100% (95%CI: 79.4, 100.0). 
At that data cutoff, the data was too immature to provide the estimated median of the DoR, the PFS and 
the OS. It is nonetheless observed at a median follow-up of 20.1 months (95%CI: 9.3, 25.8), the rate of 
progression-free survival  was 92.9% (95%CI: 59.1, 99.0) and at 24 months was 83.6% (95%CI: 48.0, 
95.7).  
The  TTR  and  the  TTBR  assessed  by  IRC  was  respectively  1.8  months  (25th-75th:  1.8,  4.6),  and  3.6 
months (25th-75th: 1.8, 5.5). 
With the update data, ORR in a total of 24 patients was 95.8% (95%CI: 78.9, 99.9), 20.8 %(n=5) of the 
patients had a CR, and 75% (n=18) had PR. With a median duration of follow-up of 17.8 months the DoR 
is not reached.  
Overall,  the  subgroups  analysis,  including  by  RET  fusion  partners  genes,  did not  reveal  any  remarkable 
difference to main analysis.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

While,  for  Study  LIBRETTO-001  recruitment  was  open  for  adolescent  (in  agreement  with  the  PIP 
P/0133/2023),  no  patients  with  RET  fusion-positive  TC  aged  18  years  or  less  were  identified  for 
participation in the study. Considering the rarity of the conditions this can be understandable.  
In absence of paediatric data in LIBRETTO-001, extrapolation of adult data to adolescents was proposed 
by the MAH. Extrapolation was justified based on the fact that the therapeutic benefit of a selective RET 
inhibitor  would  be  independent  of  age  and  the  clinical  outcomes  for  adolescent  patients  could  be 
extrapolated from clinical trials with predominant enrolment of adult patients as the clinical outcomes are 
primarily related to the molecular basis of cancer, their associated pathways and PK responses. Moreover 
the  medications  designed  for  some  cancers  in  adults  may  affect  the  same  pathways  in  childhood  and 
adolescent cancers. 
These hypotheses were however poorly justified and documented and  the arguments provided to justify 
the extrapolation of the results in adults to the paediatric population were not considered satisfactory.   
As of today, there is a lack of age-specific treatment international guidelines.  Based on American Thyroid 
Association  (ATA)  published  paediatric  specific  treatment  guidelines  for  thyroid  cancer  (Francis  et  al. 
2015),  the  primary  differences  for  children  and  adolescents  hinge  around  prevention  of  late  effects  by 
considering the appropriateness and timing of surgical resection and RAI administration the difference in 
frequency  of  molecularly  driven  thyroid  cancers;  genomically  altered  thyroid  cancer  is  predominant  in 
children.  This  is  acknowledged  and  suggests  a  similarity  in  the  treatment  strategy  across  the  two 
population. However, this is not a demonstration of the similarity of the disease. 
To support an indication in adolescents, data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 paediatric study LIBRETTO-121 
were submitted. In this trial overall 31 patients were screened and 27 were enrolled (4 screen failure). Of 
these,  10  had  a  RET  Fusion-Positive  TC  and  were  included  in  the  efficacy  analysis.  Eight  patients  were 
aged 12 to 17 years and 2 were aged 18 to 20 years. 
ORR was 60.0% (95%CI: 26.2, 87.8) as assessed by the IRC. Three patients had confirmed complete 
response whilst 3 patients had confirmed partial response. This was consistent with the ORR as assessed 
by Investigators 50.0% (95%CI: 18.7, 81.3). Although, this level of response can be seen as promising, 
it appears lower compared to adults. It is acknowledged that 70% of the patients were in 2n+ lines, 
however the OR remain lower than for adults previously treated with systemic therapy (85.4% (95%CI: 
70.8, 94.4)). Three (42.9%) patients with non-measurable disease were included in the study LIBRETTO-
121 while none were included in LIBRETTO-001 and patients with non-measurable disease can be 
considered responders only if they have CR and otherwise must be considered to have non-CR/non-PR or 
PD. Additionally, paediatric patients with measurable disease (n=4, 57,1%) had an ORR of 100%. Even 
though uncertainties remained on the effect size, the ORR data in the paediatric population are promising.  
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The main limitations in relation to the efficacy of selpercatinib are related to the uncontrolled nature of 
the pivotal evidence which hampers the assessment of the time-to-event endpoints and the limited 
number of patients included. 
To confirm the benefits observed in study LIBRETTO-001 for the adult’s patient population and in order to 
fulfil a CMA the MAH will submit the final data from the cohort 2 of the pivotal study LIBRETTO-001 (Dec 
2025). 
Data from LIBRETTO-121 are considered immature. In order to confirm the benefits observed in the 
adolescent patients population 12 year and older and fulfil the CMA criteria, the MAH will submit long-
term data from the study LIBRETTO-121 (June 2025).

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results from the ongoing phase 1/2 study LIBRETTO-001 in patients with systemic treatment 
naïve  RET  fusion-positive  thyroid  cancer  and  the  efficacy  result  from  Phase  1/2  paediatric  study, 
LIBRETTO-121  can be considered  clinically meaningful. Although immature,  estimates for the secondary 
endpoint are also promising.   
Since efficacy results are still immature, data corresponding to a longer follow-up are required (the SOBs 
studies related to the CMA). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
- 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients 
with systemic treatment naïve RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, the MAH should submit the final 
data from the cohort 2 of the pivotal study LIBRETTO-001 by December 2025 
- 
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients 
with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer, the MAH should submit the final data from the study 
LIBRETTO-121 by June 2025 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data available from a total of 796 patients in the LIBRETTO 001 study which is still ongoing were 
submitted at the start of the procedure and are presented below.  An updated safety data set with a total 
of 837 patients was submitted and assessed in the context of the annual renewal of Retsevmo 
(EMEA/H/C/005375/R/0026).  
Of the 796 patients, 54 (~ 7%) had RET fusion-positive TC and includes 18 (~34%) who were not 
previously treated with systemic therapy other than Radioactive iodine (RAI; TC: TrtSysNaïve). All 
patients in the ITT population received at least one dose of selpercatinib as of the data cut-off date of 15 
June 2021.

Table 31. Description of Safety Analysis Sets (data Cut-off: 15 June 2021) 
Patient exposure 
Through 15 June 2021, a total of 796 patients have been treated with selpercatinib at doses ranging from 
20 mg QD to 240 mg BID, most patients (96% ) received at least 1 dose of the selpercatinib 
recommended dose (Phase 2 dose) of 160 mg BID. 
Five hundred thirty-nine (539) patients (68%) were still on study, of which 462 patients (58%, including 
39 patients with TC) were still receiving selpercatinib and 77 patients (10%, including 3 patients with TC) 
were in follow-up, but off treatment. No adolescent patients are present from the ongoing pivotal study 
LIBRETTO-001 in the advanced RET fusion-positive TC population. 
The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the Overall Safety Population was disease 
progression (23%), followed by AE (~8%). 
The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the TC Safety Population was disease 
progression (13%), followed by withdrawal of consent (5.6%), significant non-compliance to protocol 
(3.7%) and AE (1.9%). 
In the TC Safety Population, 94.4% patients received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib 160 mg BID and 
94.4% patients had a selpercatinib starting dose of 160 mg.

Table 32. Treatment and study disposition (TC Safety Population) 
The median time on treatment was 21.3, 20.2 and 22.65 months, respectively, for the Overall Safety 
Population, overall TC Safety Population and naïve TC population. 
The most reported dose modification was dose withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population and 63% 
in the TC Safety Population) primarily attributed to adverse events (AEs) (64.1% in the Overall Safety 
Population and 55.6% in the overall TC Safety Population). 
Adverse events

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AST/ALT increased 
AST and ALT increases were reported in 36.7% and 35.7% of patients in the Overall Safety Population 
and 18.5% and 20.4% of patients in the TC Safety Population, respectively. Majority were of Grade 1 or 
2. 
Hypertension 
The incidence of any-grade hypertension was reported in similar proportion in both the Overall Safety 
Population (41%) and TC safety population (40.7%), 19.7% and 16.7% were Grade ≥3 in the Overall and 
TC Safety Population, respectively. Patients with a documented history of hypertension displayed a higher 
incidence of treatment-emergent Grade 3 hypertension than patients without (28% versus 14%, 
respectively). This trend is the same in the TC safety population (28.6% versus 3.8, respectively). 
Hypersensitivity 
The overall incidence of any-grade hypersensitivity was 5.9% in the Overall Safety Population. A total of 
15 patients (1.9%) in the Overall Safety and none patients in the TC Safety Population had Grade 3 
hypersensitivity. 
QT prolongation 
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported as a TEAE in similar proportion of the patients in both the 
Overall (21.1%) and TC (16.7%) Safety Populations. Most patients had TEAEs of Grade 1 or 2 in severity 
in both the Overall Safety (16.3%) and TC safety (11.2%) population. 
Laboratory findings 
The highest incidence of any grade treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality across haematology 
parameters was reported for decreased lymphocyte count (51.8% and 57.7%) and decreased white blood 
cell count (48.7% and 44.2%) in both the Overall Safety Population and the TC Safety Population, 
respectively.

The highest incidence of any grade treatment-emergent serum abnormality was reported for calcium 
decreased (58.7 and 59.6 %), and albumin decreased (55.7% and 57.7%) in both the Overall Safety 
Population and the TC Safety Population, respectively. 
Safety in special populations 
There were no significant differences in the incidence of TEAEs among the age, sex, and race subgroups 
in the Overall Safety and TC Safety Populations. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Please refer to the PK part. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to doses being withheld in 5% or more patients in both the 
Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients were ALT increase, AST increased and diarrhoea. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  a  dose  reduction  in  5%  or  more  patients  in  both  the 
Overall Safety Population and the TC: TrtSysNaïve Population (safety) were AST increase and diarrhoea. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  selpercatinib  in  4  or  more 
patients in the Overall Safety Population were ALT increased, fatigue, AST increase, and sepsis. All other 
AEs  occurred  in  less  than  4  patients.  In  the  TC:  TrtSysNaïve  Population  (safety)  no  events  leading  to 
permanent discontinuation of selpercatinib were reported. 
Safety in paediatric patient population  
The safety data for the paediatric patient population derived from Study LIBRETTO-121. As of 13 January 
2023, a total of 8 patients with RET fusion-positive TC aged 12 to 17 years and 2 patients aged 18 to 21 
years have enrolled into the Study. 
Table 39 shows the overall safety profile and Table 40 shows TEAEs experienced in the 8 adolescent 
patients with RET fusion-positive TC.

Post marketing experience 
As  of  April  2022,  Selpercatinib  was  approved  in  36  countries  including  those  in  the  EU,  the  US  and 
Switzerland for treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC and RET-mutant medullary thyroid 
cancer regardless of line of therapy, and RET fusion-positive TC in the second-line setting. Specific patient 
populations and dosing guidance vary by country. Cumulatively, up to 30 April 2022, an estimated 1900 
patients were exposed to selpercatinib worldwide. The data reported from the post-marketing setting are 
generally  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  selpercatinib.  Most  events  were  reported  as  non-
serious,  and  the  most  frequently  reported  events  were  recognised  ADRs  for  selpercatinib  or  clinically 
expected in the target indication. 
Overall,  no  new  significant  safety  information  has  been  identified  from  post-marketing  sources.  The 
periodic  safety  update  report/periodic  benefit-risk  evaluation  report  with  a  data  lock  of  08  May  2022 
confirmed and supported the previously established favourable benefit-risk profile for selpercatinib in the 
currently approved indications.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Whitin this procedure safety was evaluated in patients from the Overall Safety Population (N=796) and in 
the TC Safety Population (N=54) who received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib as of the data cut-off date 
of  15  June  2021.  The  overall  Safety  Population  included  in  the  SmPC  (837  patients)  derives  from 
Procedure EMEA/H/C/005375/R/0026 concluded on 05/01/2024. 
No  adolescent  patients  are  present  from  the  ongoing  pivotal  study  LIBRETTO-001  in  the  advanced  RET 
fusion-positive TC population. 
In  terms  of  exposure,  the  median  time on  treatment  was  21.29  and  20.2  months,  respectively,  for  the 
Overall  Safety  Population  and  TC  Safety  Population.  In  the  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  (not  previously 
treated with systemic therapy other than RAI - TC: TrtSysNaïve  patients) (n=18), the median treatment 
duration  is  22.3  months  (range:  0.4  to  35.6  months)  and  86.2%  of  patients  were  on  treatment  for  at 
least 24 months. 
The  median  relative  dose  intensity  was  similar  for  the  Overall  Safety  Population  (94.5%)  and  the  TC 
Safety Population (96.9%). 
The  most  reported  dose  modification  was  dose  withheld  (72.9%  in  the  Overall  Safety  Population  and 
63.0%  in  the  TC  Safety  Population)  primarily  attributed  to  adverse  events  (AEs)  (64.2%  in  the  Overall 
Safety Population and 57.4% in the TC Safety Population). 
The  types  and  incidence  rates  of  AEs  leading  to  doses  being  withheld,  dose  reductions,  and  treatment 
discontinuation were consistent between the Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients (not 
previously treated with systemic therapy other than RAI - TC:TrtSysNaïve patients). 
The most frequent TEAEs reported in 2% or more patients both in the Overall Safety Population and TC: 
TrtSysNaïve (Safety) were pneumonia and abdominal pain. 
Fatal  TEAEs  were  reported  in  21  patients  at  the  initial  MAA  compared  with  45  patients  at  the  15  June 
2021 data cut-off. In Treatment-Naïve Patients, a fatal (Grade 5) TEAE was experienced by one patient 
late onset and due to disease progression.  
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  analysed  did  not  change  compared  to  those  reported 
previously for Retsevmo. 
The safety profile observed in the data from the 15 June 2021 cut-off and from the 13 January 2023 cut-
off (procedure EMEA/H/C/005375/R/0026 concluded on 05/01/2024) concluded on 05.01.2024). remains 
consistent  with  previously  reported  data.  No  new  ADRs  or  AESIs  have  been  identified  since  initial 
authorisation  and  the  safety  profile  is  consistent  between  the  TC:  TrtSysNaïve  patients  and  the  Overall 
Safety Population. 
There  were  8  patients  <  18  years  (range  12-17)  of  age  with  RET  fusion  positive  thyroid  cancer  in 
LIBRETTO 121. No unique safety findings in children aged less than 18 years have been identified.  
The safety profile of the  existing key risks of liver injury and cardiac arrhythmia due to QT prolongation 
were consistent with the previous analysis. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Although safety results remain consistent with previously reported data they come from a low number of 
adult and paediatric patients with  TC:TrtSysNaïve.  Further  safety data  will be  provided from  LIBRETTO-
001 and study LIBRETTO-121 as specific obligations (SOBs).

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of selpercatinib in the Patients with Thyroid Carcinomas Not Previously Treated 
with systemic therapy other than RAI is overall consistent with that of the Overall Safety Population. The 
safety data submitted as part of this application indicate a safety profile for selpercatinib consistent with 
that reported previously.. Longer-term safety data from adult and paediatric patient with TC:TrtSysNaïve 
will be provided from LIBRETTO-001 and study LIBRETTO-121 as specific obligations (SOBs).

Routine risk minimisation measures remain sufficient to mitigate the risks of selpercatinib in all 
indications. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2,4,4, 4.8 and 5.1, of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The proposed revisions do not significantly affect the overall readability. It is not considered necessary to 
conduct consultation with target patient groups further to that performed for the initial MAA. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The agreed indication is: 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with: advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive 
iodine is appropriate) 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard options for patients in first-line with advanced thyroid cancer refractory to iodine include 
sorafenib and levantinib according to ESMO guidelines. However, no targeted agents are approved as 
first-line therapy for patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in treatment of (i) adults with an advanced RET fusion-positive 
thyroid cancer without prior standard first line therapy, and (ii) adolescents with an advanced RET fusion-
positive thyroid cancer (i.e. first and second line) are based on analyses of the interim data from 
LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-17001) and LIBRETTO-121 respectively. 
LIBRETTO-001 is a global, multi-cohort, open-label, phase 1/2 study in adult and adolescent patients with 
advanced RET-altered tumours. The phase 2 portion evaluates efficacy in cohorts based on tumour type, 
type  of  RET  alteration,  and  prior  treatment.  The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  ORR  by  IRC 
assessment according to RECIST 1.1. DOR, PFS and OS were secondary endpoints. 
LIBRETTO-121 is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients (≥ 12 years of age and 
≤  21  years)  with  an  advanced  solid  or  primary  CNS  tumor  harboring  an  activating  RET  alteration 
(LIBRETTO-121.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Of the RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer patients naive to systemic therapy other than radioactive iodine, 
and enrolled in LIBRETTO-001, 24 patients had the opportunity to be followed for at least 6 months and 
were considered efficacy eligible.   
At the data cut-off of 13 January 2023, 8 more patients were included in the analysis. The data showed 
an ORR in a total of 24 patients of 95.8% (95%CI: 78.9,  99.9), with 20.8 %(n=5)  of  the  patients with 
CR,  and  75%  (n=18)  with  PR.  With  a  median  duration  of  follow-up  of  17.8  months,  the  DoR  was  not 
reached (95% CI: 42.8 months, not estimable).  
As of 13 January 2023, 10 patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer aged 12 to   years have 
been treated in LIBRETTO-121. Of these 10 patients, 8 patients were less than 18 years of age. Of the 10 
patients, 4 were previously treated with radioactive iodine only, 2 had received prior systemic therapy 
that did not include radioactive iodine and 4 were not previously treated with any systemic therapy. For 
all 10 patients, objective response rate was 60.0% (95% CI: 26.2, 87.8) per IRC. Three (3) patients had 
confirmed complete response whilst 3 patients had confirmed partial response. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations are  mainly related  to  the uncontrolled nature of the pivotal trial which 
hampers the interpretation of the time-to-event endpoints (PFS, OS).  
Contextualisation of the data coming from an uncontrolled study with the results of other systemic 
therapy (e.g. lenvatinib and sorafenib) is challenging given that response rates observed for selpercatinib 
have been reported in a selected patient population including only patients with RET fusions, while other 
medicines have been investigated in unselected patient populations. 
The selected population raises several concerns: progressive disease status at baseline was not a 
selection criteria, status of having received RAI prior selpercatinib at inclusion was not recorded in a clear 
manner, and there is a lack of information on screening failure. 
The efficacy data are yet mature and longer follow-up is needed.  
These remaining limitations will be addressed post authorisation with the submission of updated data and 
longer follow-up from the studies LIBRETTO-001 and LIBRETTO-121 (SOBs).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data assessed in the current procedure are available from a total of 796 patients  the  LIBRETTO-
001  study.  The  safety  data  from  837  patients  reflected  in  the  SmPC  were  assessed  in  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005375/R/0026 concluded on 05/01/2024.  
Safety  was  evaluated  in  patients  in  the  Overall  Safety  Population  (N=796)  and  in  the  TC  Safety 
Population  (N=54)  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  selpercatinib  as  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  15  June 
2021.  
In  terms  of  exposure,  the  median  time on  treatment  was  21.29  and  20.2  months,  respectively,  for  the 
Overall  Safety  Population  and  TC  Safety  Population.  In  the  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  (not  previously 
treated with systemic therapy other than RAI - TC: TrtSysNaïve patients) (n=18), the median treatment 
duration  is  22.3  months  (range:  0.4  to  35.6  months)  and  86.2%  of  patients  were  on  treatment  for  at 
least 24 months.

The  most  frequent  TEAEs  (any  grade)  occurring  30%  or  more  in  the  TC:  TrtSysNaïve  (Safety)  were 
abdominal pain, rash, headache, and lymphopaenia. 
The  most  frequent  Grade  3  or  higher  TEAEs  reported  in  5%  or  more  of  patients  in  both  the  
TC:  TrtSysNaïve  (Safety)  patients  and  Overall  Safety  Population  were  hypertension,  lymphopaenia 
hyponatraemia, ALT increased, AST increased, and diarrhoea. 
The most common treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TE-SAEs) occurring in ≥2% of patients in 
the TC Safety Populations were abdominal pain, pneumonia, sepsis, vomiting and pyrexia. 
The most common treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TE-SAEs) occurring in ≥2% of patients in 
the TC: TrtSysNaïve Population were abdominal pain, sepsis, respiratory failure, vomiting, cardiac failure, 
diverticulitis, cholestasis, hepatic haemorrhage, and lymphopaenia. 
In TC: TrtSysNaïve Population, there was 1 death in total that occurred more than 28 days after the final 
dose of selpercatinib due to disease progression. No patients experienced a fatal (Grade 5) TEAE. 
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  analysed  did  not  change  compared  to  those  reported 
previously. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No  adolescent  patients  are  present  from  the  ongoing  pivotal  study  LIBRETTO-001  in  the  advanced  RET 
fusion-positive  TC  population  and  data  from  study  LIBRETTO-121  are  limited  to  10  paedatric  patients. 
Data  in  adults  are  limited  to  24  patients.  Data  on  long-term  safety  in  adult  and  adolescent  will  be 
provided from LIBRETTO-001 and study LIBRETTO-121 as specific obligations (SOBs).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Data supporting this application for selpercatinib as monotherapy for adults with advanced RET fusion-
positive thyroid cancer without prior standard first line therapy (i.e. first-line setting), is based on a 
single-arm study LIBRETTO-001, which remains largely exploratory and make interpretation of time to 
event endpoints and any potential long-term benefit challenging. 
Nevertheless, this approach is acceptable in the context of a CMA for a product intended for a patient 
population with high unmet medical need when the observed ORR is outstanding and durable.  
The obtained ORR of 95.8 % is considered meaningful in patients with RET- fusion-positive TC in first-line 
setting. 
Median DOR was not reached at a median follow-up time of 17.8 months and rate of patients with 
duration response at 12 and 24 months suggest lasting benefits from treatment with selpercantinib. 
Other approved front-line therapies with established benefit are approved, and an indirect comparison 
could not be performed due to the specificity of selpercatinib molecular target. The activity of 
selpercatinib is however considered compelling.  
The safety profile observed in the data from the 15 June 2021 cut-off  and data from 13 June 2023 cut-
off submitted in the context of the parallel procedure EMEA/H/C/005375/R/0026 remains consistent with 
previously reported data. No new ADRs or AESIs have been identified since initial authorisation and the 
safety profile is consistent between the Treatment-Naïve Patients and the Overall Safety Population.  
To support the extension of indication in adolescent 12 years of age and older with advanced RET fusion-
positive thyroid cancer data from study LIBRETTO-121 have been provided.  Even though the efficacy 
results from LIBRETTO-121 were lower than anticipated with an ORR of 60.0% (95% CI: 26.2, 87.8), the 
ORR remains positive and promising. Additional Efficacy and Safety Data from LIBRETTO--001 and 
LIBRETTO-121 Studies will be provided to address remaining uncertainties.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The provided results from LIBRETTO-001 and LIBRETTO-121 have shown activity in term of tumour 
shrinkage. Responses appear durable and the safety profile is consistent with that reported previously. 
In view of the remaining uncertainties related to the limited data set and duration of follow-up, final 
efficacy and safety data are required as confirmatory evidence (SOBs). 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available in the first-line treatment of RET- fusion-positive 
TC, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant for this extension of indication. 
The new indication for this product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above.  
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant will 
provide final efficacy and safety data with longer follow-up for both the adults and paediatric 
patient populations. Results are expected with LIBRETTO-001 study, Cohort 2 by December 2025 
for the adult population and with LIBRETTO-121 study by June 2025 for the paediatric population.   
•  Unmet medical need will be addressed. One factor preventing inter-study comparison with other 
MKIs is the difference between patient populations. Indeed, response observed in selpercatinib 
have been observed in a population including only patients with RET fusions, while other 
approved medicines in TC have been investigated in an unselected patient population. The 
missing information is relative sensitivity of patients with tumours harbouring RET fusion to MKIs 
(lenvatinib and sorafenib) when compared to unselected patients. The MKI with the higher 
estimated ORR is lenvatinib with 65% (95% CI: 59.0; 71.0). Considering that the ORR of 
selpercatinib in this selected patient population is outstanding with 95.8% (95% CI: 78.9, 99.9), 
it is unlikely that the RET TC naïve patients treated with Lenvatinib or sorafenib would experience 
a dramatically higher response rate compared to the unselected patients. Altogether, it is 
considered that a major therapeutic advantage over the existing authorised medicinal products in 
the overlapping indication is demonstrated. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the positive benefit/risk and the unmet medical need 
in the applied indication as described above, this is considered fulfilled. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Retsevmo for the first line treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with 
advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is 
appropriate) is positive subject to the specific obligations and conditions imposed in order to inform the 
long-term efficacy and safety profile of the product in this new indication.

Extension of indication to include the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with 
advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer in the first-line setting for RETSEVMO based on interim data 
from studies LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-17001) and LIBRETTO-121; LIBRETTO-001 is an open-label, 
multicentre, global Phase 1/2 study of selpercatinib in patients with RET-altered advanced solid tumors. 
LIBRETTO-121 is a Phase 1/2 study of selpercatinib in paediatric patients with advanced RET-altered solid 
or primary central nervous system tumours. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 5.3 of the RMP has been 
agreed. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

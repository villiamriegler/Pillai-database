1. 
Introduction 
Avastin (Bevacizumab) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody. It inhibits angiogenesis by 
neutralizing all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), and blocking their 
binding  to  VEGF  receptors.  Bevacizumab  binds  to  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  and 
thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), on the 
surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF reduces the vascularisation of 
tumours, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. 
Avastin  is  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  cancer  of  the 
colon or rectum (mCRC), in combination with intravenous 5- fluorouracil/folinic acid or intravenous 
5-fluorouracil/folinic  acid/irinotecan,    the  treatment  of  locally  recurrent  and  metastatic  breast  cancer 
(mBC)  and  in  combination  with  platinum-based  chemotherapy  for  first-line  treatment  of  advanced 
non-squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 
The  data  submitted  in  this  application,  support  an  extension  of  the  indication  to  include  the 
combination of bevacizumab and interferon alfa-2a in the treatment of patients with advanced and/or 
metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC).  
RCC  is  an  adenocarcinoma  originating  in  the  renal  cortex  which  accounts  for  about  2%  of  all  solid 
tumours, and 90-95% of tumours arising from the kidney. The four main histological subtypes of RCC 
are,  according  to  their  degree  of  increasing  aggressiveness,  oncocytic,  chromophobic,  chromophilic 
and  clear-cell.  The  latter,  consisting  of  cells  derived  from  the  proximal  tubule  with  cytoplasm  that 
appears empty, accounts for 75% -80% of all cases of RCC. Commonly, RCC presents as a mixture of 
these  different  histological  subtypes.  The  incidence  of  kidney  cancer  in  Europe  for  males  is  about 
twice that for females (11.04 and 5.04 (per 100,000), respectively), with a mortality rate which is also 
twice that in males than in females (5.4 and 2.4 (per 100,000), respectively). 
The  current  standard  of  care  for  RCC  is  nephrectomy,  for  local  as  well  as  for disseminated  disease, 
followed by systemic therapy for metastatic disease. In general, patients who present with metastatic 
disease  usually  have  a  poor  prognosis  even  when  their  primary  and  metastatic  disease  has  been 
resected.  The  5-year  survival  of  patients  with  metastatic  disease  is  5  -15%.  In  some  patients  with 
metastatic  disease,  nephrectomy  may  be  justified  because  removal  of  bulk  disease  can  improve 
constitutional symptoms that are typical of mRCC, and in addition, local symptoms such as loin pain 
and haematuria can be alleviated if they exist. Conventional hormonal and chemotherapy treatments 
are generally regarded as having little or no effect against RCC, with response rates typically in the 
range  of  4%  –  6%.  This  apparent  resistance  may  be  due  to  the  expression  of  a  multidrug  resistance 
transporter  in  the  proximal  tubule  cells.  Vinblastine,  one  of  the  most  extensively  studied,  failed  to 
show any antitumour activity in more recent trials, and responses to floxuridine are usually partial and 
relatively short lived. 
Cytokines  have  been  widely  used  as  first-line  therapy  of  metastatic  disease,  but  are  generally 
considered  to  be  only  modestly  effective.  IFN-alfa  has  been  extensively  investigated  in  randomized 
trials as monotherapy and in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gemcitabine 
and  vinblastine.  It  is  approved  in  Europe  for  advanced  RCC,  based  on  a  randomised  study 
1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
demonstrating  an  increase  in  overall  survival  (OS),  when  combined  with  vinblastine,  from  37  to  68 
weeks. In  more recent studies however, IFN in combination with vinblastine has not been shown to 
improve response rates or OS compared to IFN alone. 
Very rare long-term remissions of metastatic disease have been achieved only with high-dose IL-2, the 
currently approved standard of care in the United States. However, its toxicity profile, particularly the 
capillary  leak  syndrome  associated  with  severe  hypotension,  pulmonary  oedema  and  renal 
dysfunction, severely limits its broad use. 
In 2005 and 2006, two oral protein kinase inhibitors, sorafenib and sunitinib, which inhibit tumour cell 
proliferation and vascularisation, were approved for the second-line treatment of advanced RCC. 
Sorafenib was shown to increase progression free survival (PFS) and OS compared to placebo, and 
sunitinib increased the overall response rate (ORR) in patients who had failed IFN-alfa or IL-2. More 
recently, sunitinib has been shown to significantly increase PFS compared to IFN-alfa (11 months 
versus 5 months, respectively; p<0.001) in previously untreated patients with mRCC. It has been 
approved in USA and Europe as first-line therapy in this indication. In spite of the fact that there is no 
OS benefit reported yet, sunitinib has, in the past six months, become a new standard of treatment in 
the USA. Sorafenib has however failed to show such a benefit in PFS over IFN-alfa in a randomised 
clinical trial in previously untreated patients with mRCC.  
In November 2007, a selective inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, temsirolimus, a 
serine/threonine kinase involved in controlling many cellular functions such as cell proliferation, cell 
survival, protein synthesis and transcription, was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced 
RCC. Temsirolimus has been shown to increase OS compared to IFN-alfa alone. For the comparison 
between the combination of temsirolimus and IFN-alfa with IFN-alfa alone, the difference in OS was 
not statistically significant. 
Despite  the  availability  of  these  newer  compounds,  the  management  of  patients  with  mRCC  still 
remains  a  major  therapeutic  challenge  and  highlights  the  high  medical  need  for  expanding  new 
therapeutic  choices  in  this  indication.  The  benefit  in  OS  from  IFN-alfa,  despite  its  limitation  to  few 
patients, has improved during the past decade. However, long-term survival for patients with mRCC 
remains modest. Hence, combining newer treatment modalities with this established standard appears 
to be a logical step forward in treating patients with mRCC.  
2. 
Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  programme  investigating  the  use  of  bevacizumab  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  and/or 
mRCC,  consists  of  one  controlled  pivotal  Phase  III  study,  BO17705,  of  bevacizumab  as  first-line 
therapy in combination with interferon alfa-2a as first line treatment in patients with advanced and/or 
mRCC,  and  two  supportive  controlled  Phase  II  studies,  AVF0890s  (second-line  bevacizumab 
monotherapy), and AVF2938g (first-line bevacizumab monotherapy versus erlotinib combination).  
2. 1. Clinical pharmacology 
The results of the clinical pharmacology program for bevacizumab were extensively discussed in the 
original  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  colorectal  cancer 
the  Type  II  Variation  applications  for  metastatic  breast  cancer 
EMEA/H/C/582,  and 
EMEA/H/C/582/II/08  and  non-small  cell

application summarizes the previously submitted data and the focuses on new information from three

in 
In  the  present  dossier,  the  applicant  presents  the  results  of  two  interaction  studies  (AVF3135g  and 
NP18587)  in  which  it  is  demonstrated  that  administration  of  bevacizumab  does  not  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  either  irinotecan/SN38  or  capecitabine  and  oxaliplatin.  AVF3135  has  already 
been assessed once as FUM 016 and finalised at the January 2007 meeting.

These  results  support  the  previously  submitted  data  showing  a  lack  of  interaction  between 
bevacizumab and co-administered anticancer therapies. 
Furthermore, an interaction study with specific relevance for the RCC indication was presented:  
A  substudy  was  conducted  within  the  Phase  III  study  BO17705  in  patients  with  advanced  and/or 
metastatic RCC with the purpose of assessing the potential effect of bevacizumab on interferon alfa-2a 
pharmacokinetics. 
Patients  and  Methods:  The  pharmacokinetic  assessments  for  interferon  alfa-2a  were  performed  in 
patients who were stable on bevacizumab from Week 7 onwards (4th bevacizumab infusion). Fourteen 
(14) patients were randomized to the interferon alfa-2a plus bevacizumab group (Bv + IFN), and 12 
were randomized to the interferon alfa-2a plus placebo group (Pl + IFN). The primary parameter for 
the statistical analysis was the dose-normalized AUC0-last and secondarily the dose-normalized Cmax 
of interferon alfa-2a. Thirteen (13) patients were analyzed for AUC0-last, and 12 for Cmax in the Bv + 
IFN arm and 11 patients for AUC0-last and Cmax in the Pl + IFN arm. 
Results:  Interferon  alfa-2a  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  derived  from  the  serum  concentrations 
following the 4th or subsequent bevacizumab infusions. Results are summarized in Table 1. The mean 
concentration-time profiles were comparable for the Bv + IFN arm and the Pl + IFN arm (Figure 1).

The  geometric  mean  ratio  for  dose-normalized  AUC0-last  was  1.089  (90%  CI=0.816-1.453)  and  for 
dose-normalized Cmax was 1.179 (90% CI=0.837-1.660). 
In  conclusion,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  effect  of  bevacizumab  on  the  PK  of  interferon. 
There  was  a  trend  to  an  increased  interferon  ratio  of  1.1  and  1.2  for  AUC  and  Cmax.  However,  a 
clinically significant effect is very unlikely due to the small deviation of these ratios from 1. 
Furthermore,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  bevacizumab  were  characterized  in  patients  with  mRCC.  In 
conclusion,  the  PK  parameters  of  bevacizumab  were  comparable  to  those  previously  reported  for 
Avastin. 
Finally,  in  study  BO17705,  a  population  pharmacokinetic  substudy  was  performed  by  Bayesian-
feedback  analysis  of  bevacizumab  PK  data.  Individual  bevacizumab  concentration-time  profiles  and 
individual  PK  parameters  were  predicted  based  on  empirical  Bayes  estimates  obtained  from  a 
reference population PK model and the BO17705 data. The reference  model was the population PK 
model  used  to  describe  the  pharmacokinetics  of  bevacizumab  in  previously  investigated  populations 
(reference  population),  i.e.  oncology  patients  with  different  types  of  cancer  (4629  bevacizumab 
samples collected from 491 patients who received intravenous doses of bevacizumab ranging from 1 
to 20 mg/kg at a dosing frequency ranging from every 1 to 3 weeks). The BO17705 pharmacokinetic 
population for Bayesian-feedback analysis was defined as all blood samples for the bevacizumab PK 
assessment (both sparse and rich sampling scheme) associated with a documented dosing history.

In  conclusion  the  metrics  used  in  this  population  PK  analysis  allow  the  conclusion  that  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  bevacizumab  are  comparable  in  patients  with  advanced  and/or  metastatic  RCC 
and  the  previously  investigated  population  consisting  of  oncology  patients  with  different  types  of 
cancer. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  bevacizumab  have  not  been  studied  in  children  and  adolescents,  or  in 
specific  studies  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment,  and  there  are  no  new  data  for  these 
patients groups. 
2. 2. Clinical Efficacy 
•  Main studies and methods 
The  three  studies  supporting  this  MAA,  the  pivotal  phase  III  study  BO17705,  and  the  two  phase  II 
supportive studies, AVF0890s and AVF2938g, were adequately controlled, randomized, double-blind, 
with a comparative parallel group design.  
All  three  studies  enrolled  predominately  nephrectomised  patients  who  were  at  least  18  years  of  age 
with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic clear-cell RCC.  
In  general  the  key  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  similar  among  the  three  studies.  These 
included the requirement that patients had adequate organ function as determined by laboratory tests, 
including haematology and tests for liver and renal function. In addition, at enrolment, patients were 
required  to  have  no  evidence  of  central  nervous  system  metastases  or  spinal  cord  compression, 
bleeding  diathesis  or  coagulopathy,  or  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  disease,  including 
cerebrovascular accidents (≤6 months), myocardial infarction (≤ 6 months), NYHA Class II or greater 
congestive  heart  failure  and  serious  cardiac  arrhythmias  requiring  medication.  Patients  with 
uncontrolled hypertension were excluded from participation in the studies.  
Study BO17705 (pivotal): 
Objective:  This  was  a  multicenter  study  recruiting  in  101  centres  in  18  countries  in  Eastern  and 
Western Europe and Australasia. It compared bevacizumab in combination with interferon-alfa-2a (N 
=  327)  to  placebo  plus  interferon  (N  =  322)  as  first-line  therapy  of  nephrectomised  patients  with 
advanced and/or mRCC. Patients were stratified to treatment according to country and to risk category 
according  to  Motzer  score  (favourable,  intermediate  and  poor  risk  groups)  in  order  to  avoid  an 
imbalance in prognostic factors between the two treatment arms. 
Inclusion/exclusion: Patients were required to have a Karnofsky performance status of at least 70%. 
Patients with measurable and non-measurable disease were included as the objective response rate was 
only  a  secondary  endpoint.  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had  received  prior  systemic  or  adjuvant 
therapy for RCC. 
Dosing: Bevacizumab was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight every two weeks (q2w), and 
interferon alfa-2a at a target dose of 9 MIU three times weekly for 52 weeks in both treatment arms 
until  disease  progression  or  unmanageable  toxicity  was  seen.  Only  a  delay  in  bevacizumab 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration was allowed for toxicity reasons, while the dose of interferon alfa-2a could be reduced 
in  two  stages  (6  MIU  and  3  MIU)  in  case  of  interferon  toxicity.  Patients  in  the  interferon  alfa-2a 
control arm also received a placebo in fusion (q2w) to maintain the double-blind. At the time the study 
was  unblinded,  patients  in  the  interferon  alfa-2a  arm  were  given  the  opportunity  to  receive 
bevacizumab monotherapy, as the one year IFN therapy period had been passed. 
The choice of 10 mg/kg q2w bevacizumab as the dose to be tested in the pivotal study BO17705, was 
based  on  the  results  of  the  dose  finding  study  AVF0890s,  in  which,  compared  to  placebo,  a 
statistically  significant  prolongation  in  the  time  to  disease  progression  and  an  improved  overall 
response rate was seen with 10 mg/kg q2w, but not with 3 mg/kg q2w. The safety profile of 10 mg/kg 
q2w was acceptable in the monotherapy setting. 
Interferon alfa-2a has been used in RCC at doses ranging from 3 MIU to 18 MIU given three times a 
week. However, since no clear dose dependent efficacy has been shown over this dose range, and in 
view of the toxicity profile observed with interferon alfa-2a at the different dosages, the use of 9 MIU 
three times a week in study BO17705 was considered to be the preferred dose in terms of the required 
efficacy and acceptable toxicity with respect to the duration of treatment. It is also the most commonly 
used  dosing  regimen  in  this  indication  in  Europe,  and  therefore  the  best  experience  exists  with  the 
management of its adverse effects. To further increase the tolerability, the initial doses of interferon in 
study BO17705 could be reduced and then escalated to the recommended dose level during the first 
two weeks of treatment. The duration of interferon dosing used in study BO17705 of one year is in 
line  with  the  recommendation  for  responding  patients.  Dose  reductions  to  6  MIU  or  3  MIU  were 
allowed  depending  on  the  side  effects  observed.  No  dose  reductions  were  allowed  for  bevacizumab 
although dose interruptions were permissible. 
Endpoints:  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  study  BO17705  was  OS  and  the  secondary  endpoints 
were  PFS,  objective  response  rate,  duration  of  response,  time  to  disease  progression  and  time  to 
treatment failure. 
Tumour burden was assessed every eight weeks until week 32, then every 12 weeks until week 56, 
within  ±  7  days  of  the  scheduled  visit.  Patients  whose  disease  had  not  progressed  at  week  56  could 
continue in the trial and tumour assessments were performed at week 68, 12 weekly up to week 104, 
and thereafter every 6 months until disease progression. 
Study AVF0890s (supportive):  
Objective: 116 patients with metastatic clear-cell RCC who were previously treated with IL-2 (or in 
whom IL-2 was contraindicated) were randomized to treatment with bevacizumab, 3 mg/kg (N = 37) 
or 10 mg/kg (N = 39) of body weight q2w, or placebo q2w (N = 40). Patients were stratified according 
to whether or not they had previously received IL-2 therapy.  
Inclusion/exclusion:  This  study  included  patients  who  had  either  failed  previous  IL-2  therapy  or  in 
whom IL-2 was contraindicated. Patients were required to have an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1.  
Endpoints: The primary objective of this trial was time to disease progression and ORR. OS was a 
secondary objective, since patients who progressed on placebo were allowed to cross over and receive 
3 mg/kg bevacizumab therapy or combination therapy with 3 mg/kg bevacizumab and thalidomide. 
Tumour assessments were performed five weeks after therapy started, then every two months for the 
first year and every three months for the second year of therapy. 
Study AVF2938g (supportive): 
Objective: A multicenter study exploring the potential benefit of adding Tarceva® (erlotinib - 150 mg 
daily) to bevacizumab (10 mg/kg q2w) in a placebo controlled setting, in previously untreated patients 
with  metastatic  clear-cell  RCC.  51  patients  were  randomised  to  treatment  with  bevacizumab  plus 
erlotinib and 53 to bevacizumab plus placebo. The study consisted of a 24-month treatment phase and 
a follow-up phase. 
Inclusion/exclusion: Only patients with measurable disease at baseline were included. Patients were 
required to have an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1.Patients were excluded if they had received 
prior systemic or adjuvant therapy for RCC. 
Endpoints: PFS and ORR were the two co-primary efficacy endpoints. Secondary efficacy parameters 
were the duration of objective response, OS and time to symptom progression. 
Tumour assessments were taken every two months (±4 days) during treatment.

Statistical analyses:  
In studies BO17705 and AVF0890s, the primary population for the analysis of efficacy was the intent-
to-treat (ITT) population which included all patients randomised into each study. Efficacy analyses in 
study AVF2938g were based on the efficacy evaluable population, which was defined as any patient 
who  received  any  treatment  during  the  study  and  who  had  at  least  one  post-baseline  tumour 
assessment.  The  data  in  all  three  studies  was  analysed  using  standard  statistical  methods  (log  rank 
tests), including Kaplan Meier curves with median survival estimates and confidence limits. 
The  primary  analysis  of  OS  and  PFS  in  Study  BO17705  was  based  on  an  unstratified  analysis.  In 
addition, stratified Cox regression analyses, using region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, other) and 
Motzer score at baseline as stratification factors, were performed to test the robustness of the results.  
In summary, all three studies investigated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab given at a dose of 10 
mg/kg q2w, either alone (AVF0890s, AVF2938g), in combination with erlotinib (AVF2938g), or in 
combination with interferon alfa-2a (BO17705), and all studies had a standard design with no unusual 
features.  The  population  of  patients  enrolled  in  all  three  studies  was  similar  and  representative  of 
patients with advanced and/or mRCC. The main difference between the studies was that bevacizumab 
was given as first-line therapy in studies BO17705 (in addition to IFN) and AVF2938g (in addition to 
erlotinib), and as second-line therapy following treatment with IL-2 in study AVF0890s. 
•  Results 
Study BO17705 (pivotal): 
Patients: This study enrolled a total of 649 patients with advanced and/or mRCC, of whom 327 were 
randomized to treatment with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q2w plus interferon alfa-2a 9 MIU 3x/wk, and 
322 to treatment with placebo q2w plus interferon alfa-2a 9 MIU 3x/wk. 
Demographics: The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable across the 
treatment arms. The mean age of the patients in the Bv + IFN arm (60.1 years) was similar to that in 
the Pl + IFN arm (59.4 years), the patients enrolled in both arms were predominantly male (73% and 
68%, respectively), and the majority were white (97% and 95%, respectively). Most patients in both 
treatment  arms  had  a  Karnofsky  performance  status  score  of  ≥  90  at  baseline,  and  a  Motzer  score 
which  was  intermediate.  All  patients  were  nephrectomized  (or  partially nephrectomized  with  clearly 
negative resection margins). 
Results: The results of the analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy parameters are based on the 
intent-to-treat population of patients (all randomised patients) and include 327 patients in the BV+IFN 
arm and 322 patients in the Pl+IFN arm (Table 3).

a Median not reached; b CR + PR; Patients with measurable disease at baseline 
Primary endpoint: There was a strong trend for an improvement in OS in favour of the Bv + IFN arm 
compared to the Pl + IFN arm, with a relative risk reduction of 21% in the Bv + IFN arm. However, 
the difference between the two treatments (unstratified HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.62, 1.02; p-value (log rank) 
0.0670) did not reach the pre-specified level of statistical significance (p=0.0056) for this interim 
analysis .(Figure 2). The results represent the final analysis of PFS at this time point. The final analysis 
of OS will be performed after a sufficient number of events have been collected.

The  stratified  analysis,  which  took  into  account  the  country  and  baseline  Motzer  risk  category,  also 
showed a strong trend for an improvement in OS in the Bv + IFN arm (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58, 0.97; p-
value (log-rank) 0.0267).  
In the largest subgroup of patients with an intermediate prognosis for survival based on their Motzer 
score, which represented two thirds of the population, there was also a strong trend to an increase in 
OS in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN arm HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.53, 1.02; p-value (log-
rank) 0.0680. 
Secondary endpoints: 
PFS: Treatment with Bv + IFN resulted in a clinically meaningful and highly statistically significant 
increase in the  median duration of PFS of almost five  months compared to treatment with Pl + IFN 
(median:  10.2  versus  5.4  months;  unstratified  HR  0.63;  95%  CI  0.52,  0.75;  p-value  (log-rank) 
<0.0001). The risk of an event was reduced by 27% in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN 
arm (Figure 3).

The results of the stratified analysis also showed a statistically significant increase in PFS in patients 
in the Bv + IFN arm  compared to those in the Pl + IFN arm (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.51, 0.73; p-value 
(log-rank)  <0.0001).  Patients  in  the  Bv  +  IFN  arm  who  had  an  intermediate  prognosis  for  survival 
based on their Motzer score also had a statistically significant increase in PFS (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44, 
0.70; p-value (log-rank) <0.0001).  
The increase in PFS was reflected in a statistically significant increase in the median time to disease 
progression in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN arm (10.2 vs. 5.5 months; p<0.001) and 
the risk of an event in the Bv + IFN arm was reduced by 39% compared to the Pl + IFN arm. 
The  median  time  to  treatment  failure  of  7.7  months  in  the  Bv  +  IFN  arm  was  statistically 
significantly longer than the 4.4 months seen in the Pl + IFN arm (p=0.0003).

Objective Response Rate (ORR): The incidence of patients with a best overall response of CR + PR 
was  more  than  double  in  patients  treated  with  Bv  +  IFN  (31.4%)  compared  to  those  receiving 
treatment with Pl + IFN (12.8%), which was due to a substantial increase in the incidence of patients 
with a PR in the Bv + IFN arm (30.1% versus 10.7%). Slightly more patients in the Pl + IFN arm had 
a CR than in the Bv + IFN arm (6 versus 4 patients, respectively). Patients in the Bv + IFN arm had a 
slightly  longer  median  duration  of  response  (13.5  months)  than  those  in  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm  (11.1 
months).  Thus,  adding  bevacizumab  to  interferon  alfa-2a  increased  the  response  rate  and  slightly 
increased the median duration of the response. 
Antineoplastic Therapy Given Following Disease Progression 
In the intent-to-treat analysis population of patients, antineoplastic therapies following disease 
progression (i.e., second-line treatment) were reported in 39% of patients in the Pl + IFN arm and 28% 
of patients in the Bv + IFN arm in study BO17705. The most common of these are shown in Table 4:

Treatment with sunitinib (Pl + IFN: 11%; Bv + IFN: 9%), sorafenib (Pl + IFN: 8%; Bv + IFN: 6%) 
and  radiotherapy  (Pl  +  IFN:  7%;  Bv  +  IFN:  5%)  were  the  most  common  antineoplastic  treatments 
given to patients following discontinuation of trial treatment.  
Study AVF0890s (supportive): 
Objective:  Patients  with  metastatic  clear-cell  RCC,  who  were  previously  treated  with  IL-2  (or  in 
whom IL-2 was contraindicated), were randomized to treatment with bevacizumab, 3 mg/kg (N = 37) 
or 10 mg/kg (N = 39) of body weight q2w, or placebo q2w (N = 40). Patients were stratified according 
to whether or not they had previously received IL-2 therapy.  
A total of 116 patients with clear-cell mRCC were randomized to the three treatment arms; 37 to low-
dose (3 mg/kg q2w), 39 to high-dose bevacizumab (10 mg/kg q2w) and 40 to placebo (q2w).  
Demographics: Taking into account the small number of patients enrolled in each treatment arm, the 
demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled were generally comparable across the 
three treatment arms. The median age of the patients in the three arms ranged from 53 – 54 years, and 
the majority of patients in each treatment arm were male (68% - 84%). Most patients had undergone a 
nephrectomy (>90%) prior to study entry, and the majority had received prior IL-2 therapy (>90%). 
Results:  Following  the  second  pre-planned  interim  analysis,  the  NCI  Data  Safety  and  Monitoring 
Board recommended closing accrual into the study, as the difference in the primary endpoint of time 
to  disease  progression  between  the  placebo  and  high  dose  bevacizumab  arms  was  statistically 
significance.  In  the  intent-to-treat  analysis,  the  time  to  progression  of  disease  in  the  10  mg/kg  q2w 
bevacizumab arm was significantly longer than in the placebo arm (4.8 vs., 2.5 months, respectively: 
p<0.001). The difference in the time to progression of disease in the bevacizumab 3 mg/kg q2w arm 
(3.0 months) compared to placebo was of borderline significance (p=0.041). Similar results were seen 
when  an  analysis  from  the  five-week  assessment  was  performed.  At  four  months,  the  percentage  of 
patients who had no tumour progression in 10 mg/kg q2w arm (64%) was greater than in the 3 mg/kg 
q2w arm (39%) and the placebo arm (20%), and at eight months was 30%, 14% and 5%, respectively.

Objective responses were seen in four patients, all of which were partial responses, and all occurred in 
the high dose arm. Overall survival was not significantly different between the three arms (p>0.20 for 
all comparisons). 
The  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  in  this  study  was  generally  similar  in  terms  of  the  type  and 
incidence of adverse events reported as that seen in other indications. 
Study AVF2938g (supportive): 
Objective: A multicenter study exploring the potential benefit of adding Tarceva (erlotinib - 150 mg 
daily) to bevacizumab (10 mg/kg q2w) in a placebo controlled setting, in previously untreated patients 
with  metastatic  clear-cell  RCC.  51  patients  were  randomised  to  treatment  with  bevacizumab  plus 
erlotinib and 53 to bevacizumab plus placebo. The study consisted of a 24-month treatment phase and 
a follow-up phase. 
Patients: Overall, 104 patients with histologically confirmed mRCC were randomized to treatment in 
this study, 53 to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q2w plus placebo and 51 to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q2w plus 
erlotinib 150 mg daily.  
Demographics:  The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  similar  across  the 
treatment arms. The majority of the patients enrolled in both study arms were male (Bv + Erl:64.7%; 
Bv + Pl 75.5%), and the mean age was slightly higher in the Bv + Erl arm than in the Bv + Pl arm 
(59.9 vs. 65.0 years, respectively) which was due to the inclusion of more patients ≥ 65 years of age in 
the Bv + Erl arm. The ECOG performance status was balanced across the two treatment arms as were 
the baseline Motzer risk factors; all patients were of low or intermediate risk. 
Results: Analysis of the primary endpoint PFS, showed no difference between the Bv + Pl arm and 
the  Bv  +  Erl  arm  (median  PFS  8.5  vs.  9.9  months,  respectively.  HR  0.858;  p=0.5831).  No 
improvement in the objective response rate was seen in the combination arm. Seven patients in each 
arm had an objective response, the majority of which were partial responses; one complete response 
occurred in the combination arm. Furthermore, the addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab did not result 
in an improvement in OS (HR 1.764; p=0.1789), duration of objective response (6.7 vs. 9.1 months) or 
time to symptom progression (HR 1.172; p=0.5076). 
No  new  safety  signals  were  seen  with  the  addition  of  erlotinib  to  bevacizumab  compared  to  those 
known for the two drugs separately. 
Conclusions: The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab as first-line treatment of patients with mRCC 
did  not  result  in  a  clinically or  statistically  significant  improvement  in  PFS, objective  response  rate, 
OS, duration of objective response or time to symptom progression. Nevertheless, a pooled analysis of 
the median PFS (8.6 months) compared favorably to historical data for interferon alfa (4.7 months), 
indicating that bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg q2w is active in mRCC.  
Compared to the known safety profile of the two drugs, no new safety signals were seen.

Overall, the efficacy results were better in the BO17705 study than in either of the other two studies, 
both in terms of the magnitude of the increase in the duration of PFS or time to disease progression, 
and  the  increase  in  objective  response  rate  when  bevacizumab  was  given  in  combination  with  the 
recommended dose of interferon alfa-2a. Study BO17705 was larger than the other two studies, and 
was more statistically robust, which may, in part, account for this. All three studies were double-blind, 
so it is unlikely that the investigator assessed response and progression were biased and would have 
played  a  major  role  in  contributing  to  the  difference  seen  between  the  studies.  Time  to  disease 
progression was somewhat lower in study AVF0890s than in study BO17705, which is expected given 
the fact that the patients in this study were treated with bevacizumab in the second-line setting after 
they had failed IL-2 therapy, and had a lower life expectancy.  
Study AVF2938g did not demonstrate an advantage of adding erlotinib to bevacizumab. The median 
duration of PFS seen in this study for bevacizumab monotherapy in mRCC compares favourably with 
that  previously  reported  with  the  use  of  interferon  alfa.  Study  AVF0890s,  in  which  patients  also 
received  single  agent  bevacizumab,  further  supports  the  view  that  bevacizumab  monotherapy  has 
activity in mRCC which is independent of previous exposure to other therapy in this disease. 
•  Efficacy in subgroups 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses for PFS and OS using the following factors were conducted for the 
Phase III study BO17705:  
•  Sex (male, female) 
•  Age (<65, ≥65 years) 
•  Baseline VEGF above median value, not above the median value 
•  Region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, other) 
•  Lung metastases (yes, no) 
•  Number of metastatic sites (≤2, >2) 
•  Motzer score (poor, intermediate, favorable) 
•  Body weight loss in the six months before baseline (≤10%, >10%) 
In  study  AVF2938g,  analyses  for  PFS  and  objective  response  were  performed  in  the  following 
subgroups of patients: 
•  Age (<65, ≥65 years) 
•  Sex (male, female) 
•  Race (non-White, White) 
•  ECOG performance status (0, 1) 
No subgroup analyses were conducted in study AVF0890s.

Progression-Free Survival in Subgroups – Study BO17705 
The result of the PFS analysis in each subgroup analyzed was consistent with that seen in all patients. 
In all subgroups examined, the point estimate of the hazard ratio was below 1, indicating a consistent 
benefit in PFS of adding bevacizumab to interferon alfa-2a (Figure 4). 
In the subgroup of patients who had an intermediate prognosis for survival based on their Motzer score 
at baseline, a significant increase in PFS was seen in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN arm  
(HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44, 0.70; p-value (log-rank) <0.0001).

Overall survival in Subgroups – Study B017705 
Since this was an interim analysis of OS that was performed when 251 (56%) of 445 deaths required 
for the final analysis had been observed, the data are currently not mature enough to make any firm 
conclusions on the efficacy of adding bevacizumab to interferon alfa-2a on OS. 
However,  the  results  of  each  of  the  subgroup  analyses  for  OS  were  generally  consistent  with  those 
seen  for  all  patients,  and  for  the  majority  of  subgroups,  the  point  estimate  of  the  hazard  ratio  was 
below 1 indicating a potential benefit in OS of adding bevacizumab to interferon alfa-2a (Figure 5).  
In the subgroup of patients with an intermediate prognosis for survival based on their Motzer score at 
baseline, a strong trend for an increase in OS was seen in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN 
arm.  This  analysis  included  217  Pl  +  IFN  patients,  96  of  whom  had  an  event,  and  216  Bv  +  IFN 
patients, 67 of whom had an event (HR 0.74; 95% CI [0.53, 1.02], p=0.0056). The number of patients 
in the other two subgroups – patients with a poor or a favorable Motzer score – were relatively small 
and the same trend for longer OS was not seen.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The BO17705 study demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to interferon alfa-2a as first-line 
therapy  substantially  improved  the  efficacy  of  interferon  alfa-2a  in  patients  with  advanced  and/or 
mRCC. This was shown by statistically significant and clinically relevant increases in progression free 
survival,  time  to  treatment  failure,  time  to  disease  progression  and  objective  response  rate,  while 
maintaining the duration of the response. Moreover, there was a strong trend in the interim analysis for 
an increase in OS in patients treated with the combination therapy. The observed benefit in the median 
PFS  is  impressive,  and  almost  doubled  when  bevacizumab  was  added  to  interferon  alfa-2a.  OS  was 
not shown to be significantly different, but the immaturity of the data on the one hand, and the rather 
unpredicted  high  level  of  efficacy  observed  in  the  control  arm  (median  OS  of  19.8  months), 
considerably increased the hurdle to show a significant benefit in OS. With a p-value of 0.0670 for the 
unstratified analysis, and a p-value of 0.0263 for the stratified analysis, a strong trend in OS benefit 
has been demonstrated in this study. 
The  consistency  in  the  subgroup  analyses  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  results.  It  is  noted  that  the 
benefit of bevacizumab on PFS is most striking in patients with an intermediate prognosis for survival 
(based on their Motzer score) who comprise the large majority of patients in the trial. 
For the OS analysis, no specific subgroups seem to benefit from the treatment of bevacizumab.   
All  hazard  ratios  for  both  OS  and  PFS  indicate  a  benefit  in  each  Motzer  score  sub-group  with  the 
addition of bevacizumab to interferon alfa-2a. 
The  efficacy  of  bevacizumab  in  previously  untreated  mRCC  is  further  supported  by  the  limited 
monotherapy  data  (AVF2938g),  confirming  a  very  favourable  efficacy  profile  as  compared  to  the 
interferon arm in study BO17705 (PFS of 8.5 months compared to 5.4 months in study BO17705), and 
with historical data for interferon. 
The efficacy of bevacizumab also appears to be independent of previous exposure to cytokines (IL-2) 
based on the results of study AVF0890s which showed a statistically significant increase in the time to 
14 
 
 
 
progression of the disease with bevacizumab monotherapy given as second-line treatment to patients 
with mRCC.  
 2.3.   Clinical Safety 
The safety of bevacizumab in combination with interferon alfa-2a as first-line therapy for patients with 
advanced and/or mRCC is derived from one Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial. In addition, an indication of the safety of bevacizumab as monotherapy comes from two Phase II 
studies  which  were  both  randomised,  double-blind  trials;  one  of  bevacizumab  monotherapy  in 
previously untreated patients (first-line treatment) and one in previously treated patients (second-line 
setting). Additional data of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib is also provided. 
Safety Data Collection and Analysis 
Full  safety  data  were  collected  in  study  BO17705,  including  adverse  events  of  all  NCI-CTCAE 
(version 3.0) grades up to at least 28 days post-treatment, serious adverse events (indefinite reporting), 
adverse  events  leading  to  treatment  interruption  or  discontinuation,  deaths,  laboratory  tests  and  vital 
signs.  Progression  or  deterioration  of  mRCC  (including  new  sites  of  metastasis  and  death  due  to 
disease progression) were  considered to be part of the efficacy assessment and were not reported as 
adverse events. 
In study AVF2938g, only NCI-CTCAE (version 3.0) Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, serious adverse 
events,  adverse  events  leading  to  study  treatment  interruption  or  discontinuation  and  deaths  were 
recorded until 28−45 days after the last dose of study treatment. In addition, laboratory test results and 
blood  pressure  measurements  were  recorded  in  this  study.  Adverse  events  of  all  NCI-CTC  (version 
2.0) grades were collected in study AVF0890s, but only those adverse events occurring in at least 10% 
of  patients  receiving  bevacizumab  and  those  that  were  more  frequent  than  in  patients  receiving 
placebo were reported in the publication. 
All three studies paid particular attention to the adverse events of hypertension and proteinuria which 
are  known,  from  trials  in  other  indications,  to  be  associated  with  bevacizumab  therapy.  In  addition, 
cases  of  wound  healing  complications,  gastrointestinal  perforation,  arterial  and  venous  thrombotic 
events, bleeding/haemorrhage, and congestive heart failure were followed closely in studies BO17705 
and AVF2938g.  
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  517  patients  with  mRCC  were  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of  bevacizumab  in  the  three 
studies;  129  patients  to  monotherapy  with  either  3 mg/kg  q2w  (37  patients)  or  10  mg/kg  q2w  (92 
patients) bevacizumab, 51 patients to bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q2w in combination with erlotinib, and 
337  patients  to  bevacizumab  10 mg/kg  q2w  in  combination  with  IFN  (Table  1).  At  the  time  of  the 
BO17705  data  cut-off  for  this  Summary  of  Clinical  Safety  (September  8,  2006),  which  was 
approximately 1 year after the last patient was entered into the trial, 105 (31%) of the 337 patients in 
study  BO17705  who  received  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  IFN  had  completed  52 weeks  of 
combination therapy and had changed to bevacizumab monotherapy; however, separate data for this 
monotherapy period are not available.

Adverse events 
A comparison of adverse event data across the three studies is confounded by the differences in the 
reporting  and  grading  of  events,  the  different  patient  population  sizes,  and  durations  of  treatment. 
Nevertheless, the available data indicate that the safety profile of bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg 
q2w in patients with advanced and/or mRCC is not different, whether administered as monotherapy or 
in combination with IFN or erlotinib.

1 (2%) 
The  incidence  of  Grade 3-4  proteinuria,  a  known  toxicity  associated  with  bevacizumab,  was  also 
similar  in  the  two  studies  (6%-8%)  as  well  as  in  the  10  mg/kg  q2w  bevacizumab  treatment  arm  of 
study AVF0890s (8%). The only notable exception was Grade 3-5 hypertension, which occurred at a 
much  lower  incidence  in  patients  who  received  Bv  +  IFN  in  study  BO17705  (4%)  compared  to 
patients  who  received  Bv  +  Pl  or  Bv  +  Erl  in  study  AVF2938g  (26%-31%)  and  10  mg/kg  q2w 
bevacizumab in study AVF0890s (21%). This may well be explained by a difference in the way the 
hypertension events were reported in study BO17705, as it is suspected that some investigators graded 
hypertension  events  as  Grade  2  instead  of  Grade  3,  as  they  did  not  fully  take  into  account  the 
additional  antihypertensive  medications  given  to  the  patients  when  assessing  the  grade  of 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypertension.  Furthermore,  it  is  possible  that  Grade  1  and  2  hypertension  was  treated  more 
aggressively  and/or  proactively  in  this  study  than  in  the  earlier  studies,  as  investigators  were  now 
better trained to take appropriate measures to control this side effect. 
Grade  3  and  4  adverse  events,  treatment-related  events  (any  grade),  serious  adverse  events,  and 
adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  or  modification  of  trial  treatment  (interferon  with 
bevacizumab/ placebo) showed a higher incidence in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN arm. 
This difference may be explained by a higher incidence of the adverse events known to be associated 
with bevacizumab treatment, as well as the longer duration of IFN treatment in the Bv + IFN arm (236 
days [34 weeks]) compared to the Pl + IFN arm (140 days [20 weeks]). There is some evidence that 
side effects of interferon may increase with the increased duration of treatment. Overall, taking into 
consideration  the  longer  duration  of  exposure  in  the  Bv  +  IFN  arm,  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to 
interferon  alfa-2a  did  not  appear  to  lead  to  any  clinically  significant  exacerbation  of  the  known 
toxicities of interferon. 
In the Phase II study AVF2938g, the incidences of Grade 3 or 4 (combined) adverse events, Grade 3-5 
targeted adverse events, and of adverse events leading to study discontinuation were slightly higher in 
patients  who  received  combination  therapy  with  Bv  +  Erl  compared  to  those  who  received 
bevacizumab alone. As in the BO17705 study, this may be explained by the addition of an active drug, 
in  this  case  erlotinib,  to  bevacizumab.  The  reverse  was  true  for  serious  adverse  events.  Overall,  the 
addition  of  erlotinib  to  bevacizumab  did  not  appear  to  worsen  the  toxicities  associated  with 
bevacizumab treatment. This study provides a good idea of what toxicities can be expected when using 
bevacizumab as monotherapy in mRCC. 
Adverse event data from study AVF0890s are limited to the toxic effects of any grade that occurred in 
at  least  10%  of  patients  receiving  either  dose  of  bevacizumab  and  that  were  more  frequent  than  in 
patients  receiving  placebo.  In  this  study,  no  life-threatening  Grade 4  (major  organ)  events  or  deaths 
possibly related to bevacizumab occurred. This study also clearly showed the safety profile which can 
be expected under exposure to single agent bevacizumab. 
•  Adverse events in the pivotal study B017705 
Virtually all patients in both treatment arms (94%-97%) experienced at least one adverse event (any 
grade) between the time of first drug administration and 28 days after the last drug administration. The 
most common adverse events, reported in at least 10% of patients in one or both treatment arms, were 
all known to be associated with either IFN and/or bevacizumab.       
The adverse events most commonly reported in study BO17705, but with a rather limited difference 
between  both  treatment  arms,  were  those  toxicities  known  to  be  caused  by  IFN  treatment,  and 
included pyrexia (Bv + IFN 45% vs. Pl + IFN 43%), anorexia (36% vs. 30%), fatigue (33% vs. 27%), 
asthenia  (32%  vs.  28%),  and  nausea  (28%  vs.  26%).  In  each  case,  the  incidence  was  higher  in  the 
Bv+IFN arm than in the Pl+IFN arm; however, the increase in incidence did not exceed the increase in 
median IFN exposure in the Bv+IFN arm (236 days vs. 140 days = factor of 1.7), indicating that the 
increase in incidence  may be related to the longer median duration of IFN treatment in the Bv+IFN 
arm.  A  time  to  onset  analysis  supports  this  explanation,  since  the  Kaplan  Meier  estimate  of  median 
time  to  the  first  occurrence  of  any  of  four  common  IFN-associated  toxicities  (pyrexia,  fatigue, 
asthenia, and malaise) was similar in both treatment arms (Bv+IFN 12 days vs. Pl+IFN 15 days. Other 
frequently reported IFN associated toxicities with an incidence of at least 10% in one or both treatment 
arms  were  influenza-like  illness,  chills,  diarrhoea,  myalgia,  back  pain,  depression,  weight  decrease, 
and anaemia. Most of these events occurred more frequently in the Bv + IFN arm than in the Pl + IFN 
arm.  
Established bevacizumab-specific toxicities of all grades with an incidence of at least 10% in the Bv + 
IFN arm were epistaxis (27% vs. 4%), hypertension (26% vs. 9%), and proteinuria (18% vs. 3%), and, 
as expected, all showed a much higher incidence in the Bv + IFN arm compared to the Pl + IFN arm. 
Adverse events with an incidence of at least 5% and showing a clear increase in incidence in the Bv + 
IFN  arm  compared  to  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm  were  sinusitis  (5% vs. 1%)  and  dysphonia  (5%  vs.  0%). 
Neither of these events are known to be associated with either bevacizumab or IFN treatment.  
17 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  commonly  reported  Grade  3-5  adverse  events  that  occurred  with  at  least  a  2%  difference 
between  the  treatment  arms  were  the  established  interferon  toxicities,  fatigue  and  asthenia.  Both  of 
these  events  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  receiving  combination  therapy  with  Bv  +  IFN. 
However,  these  events  occurred  throughout  the  treatment  period  in  both  arms,  suggesting  that  the 
longer duration of treatment in the Bv + IFN arm, and hence the higher number of patients at risk at 
any time point, may have resulted in the increased frequency reported for both these adverse events 
(Table  8).  Furthermore,  since  all  events  except  one  in  each  treatment  arm  were  Grade  3,  it  can  be 
concluded  that  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  IFN  did  not  result  in  a  clinically  significant 
exacerbation of these two relatively common IFN related toxicities.

Deaths:  At  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  for  the  interim  analysis  (September  8,  2006),  a  total  of 
15 patients  were  reported  as  having  died  for  reasons  other  than  disease  progression;  7/304 (2%) 
patients  in  the  Pl+IFN  arm  and  8/337  (2%)  patients  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm.  No  particular  pattern  or 
cluster of adverse events leading to death can be identified.  
Of  the  eight  deaths  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm,  four  were  associated  with  targeted  bevacizumab-associated 
adverse  events;  ruptured  aneurysm  on  Day  23,  haemoptysis  on  Day 148,  gastric  perforation  on  Day 
170, and myocardial IFNarction on Day 487. The first two (ruptured aneurysm and hemoptysis) were 
assessed by the investigator as being related to treatment. However, as outlined below, it is possible 
that  both  deaths  were  in  fact  linked  to  the  underlying  mRCC.  Note  that  four  other  gastrointestinal 
perforation adverse events resolved without sequelae.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs): were reported almost twice as frequently in the Bv + IFN arm (29%) 
than  in  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm  (16%).  However,  other  than  the  known  bevacizumab  toxicities  such  as 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  and  perforations,  epistaxis  and  haemoptysis,  and  those  commonly  seen 
with interferon treatment such as fatigue and pyrexia (all of which occurred more frequently in the Bv 
+  IFN  arm  possibly  because  of  the  longer  treatment  duration),  the  majority  of  events  were  sporadic 
occurrences in one or two patients only. 
Discontinuations:  For  both  bevacizumab/placebo  and  IFN  components  of  trial  treatment,  the 
proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event leading to discontinuation of treatment was 
higher in the Bv+IFN arm than in the Pl+IFN arm. Nevertheless, the median duration of treatment for 
both  bevacizumab/placebo  and  IFN  components  remained  significantly  longer  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm 
compared to the Pl+IFN arm. 
The increase in incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment in the Bv+IFN arm 
was approximately 3-fold for bevacizumab/placebo (Bv+IFN 63/337 [19%] vs. Pl+IFN 17/304 [6%]) 
and  2-fold  for  IFN  (76/337  [23%]  vs. 35/304 [12%]),  with  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  stopping 
IFN than bevacizumab/placebo in both treatment arms. The increase in incidence of events leading to 
discontinuation of bevacizumab can be explained by the active (bevacizumab) vs. non-active (placebo) 
treatment  whilst  the  increase  in  incidence  of  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  IFN  may  be 
explained,  at  least  in  part,  by  the  longer  duration  of  IFN  treatment  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm.  Overall, 
adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  at  least  one  component  of  trial  treatment  (either 
component) were experienced by 2.3 times as many patients in the Bv+IFN arm as in the Pl+IFN arm 
(95/337 [28%] vs. 37/304 [12%] patients.  
18 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
In the Bv+IFN arm, the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment (either 
component)  were  toxicities  known  to  be  associated  with  either  IFN  (asthenia  14/337  [4%];  fatigue 
(9/337  [3%])  or  bevacizumab  (proteinuria  16/337  [5%];  hypertension  [including  one  case  of 
hypertensive  crisis]  7/337  [2%]).  A  variety  of  gastrointestinal  disorders,  including  several 
gastrointestinal  perforations,  also  led  to  the  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  several  patients 
(13/337 [4%]). 
In  the  Pl+IFN  arm,  the  most  common  adverse  events  leading  to  discontinuation  of  treatment  (either 
component) were fatigue (5/304 [2%]), asthenia (4/304 [1%]) and depression (4/304 [1%]).  
Serious adverse events leading to discontinuation of one or both components of treatment occurred in 
32/337 (9%) patients in the Bv+IFN arm and in 15/304 (4%) patients in the Pl+IFN arm. The majority 
of events led to discontinuation of both components of treatment. Nine of 32 patients in the Bv+IFN 
arm  discontinued  treatment  due  to  a  bevacizumab-related  event;  gastrointestinal  perforation 
(4 patients),  hemorrhage  (2 patients),  cerebrovascular  accident  (1 patient),  pulmonary  embolism 
(1 patient)  and  hypertensive  crisis  (1 patient).  One  patient  in  the  Pl+IFN  arm  also  discontinued 
treatment due to intracranial hemorrhage, confirming that intracranial lesions are at very high risk of 
bleeding events. The serious adverse events leading to discontinuation in the remaining patients in the 
Bv+IFN arm, and in all patients in the Pl+IFN arm, did not show any particular clustering of events. 
•  Adverse events in study AVF2938g 
In study AVF2938g, a total of 31/53 (59%) patients in the Bv+Pl arm and 33/51 (65%) patients in the 
Bv+Erl  arm  experienced  a  Grade  3  or  4  adverse  event.  This  small  difference  in  incidence  is  not 
considered to be of clinical relevance. 
The most common type of adverse event in both treatment arms was hypertension (Bv+Pl 14/53 [26%] 
vs.  Bv+Erl  16/51  [31%]),  which  is  an  expected  event  for  bevacizumab.  Other  Grade  3  or  4  adverse 
events reported by at least 3 (6%) patients in one or both treatment groups included proteinuria, which 
is also known to be associated with bevacizumab, and rash and diarrhea, both of which are known to 
be associated with erlotinib. All other Grade 3 and 4 events were reported by ≤ 2 patients in one or 
both treatment arms, for which no clinical relevance can be established.

The majority of toxicities reported were CTC Grade 1 or 2. Bevacizumab-associated Grade 3 events 
occurring in more than one patient were hypertension, proteinuria and chest pain; all except two cases 
of Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in the 10 mg/kg bevacizumab arm. There was no Grade 4 or 5 adverse 
events in this study. 
Adverse events (Grade 1 and 2) that have not previously been associated with bevacizumab and which 
showed  an  increase  in  incidence  in  one  or  both  of  the  bevacizumab  treatment  arms  compared  to 
placebo  were  fever  without  infection,  malaise,  hyponatremia  and  elevated  alanine  aminotransferase 
(ALAT). The increases in incidence in these adverse events are in line with the suspected difference in 
duration of treatment, which suggests some link to the bevacizumab treatment. 
•  Adverse events of special interest 
Bleeding/haemorrhage, thromboembolic events (arterial or venous), hypertension, proteinuria, wound 
healing complications, congestive heart failure and gastrointestinal perforation are safety signals that 
have been identified during treatment of cancer patients with bevacizumab in a variety of indications. 
Therefore, to better understand the underlying pathogenesis, define the at risk patient population and 
therefore better manage these events, enhanced reporting was put in place to collect and report these 
“targeted events”.  
Hypertension 
Across  the  studies  there  was  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  hypertension  in  the  bevacizumab 
containing arms as compared to the control arms.  
In study BO17705, the incidence of patients who developed any grade of hypertension in the Bv + IFN 
arm was 26% compared to 9% in the Pl + IFN arm. Most occurrences were grade 1 or 2, and none 
resulted in death. Grade 3 and 4 hypertension was reported in 4% of patients in the Bv + IFN arm and 
in 1% of patients in the Pl + IFN arm, which is lower than previously reported, and also lower than 
that  seen  in  the  two  other  trials  in  RCC  reported  here  (AVF0890s  [21%]  and  AVF2938g  [26%  – 
31%]).  As  explained  previously,  this  may  be  due,  at  least  in  part,  to  the  difference  in  the  way  the 
severity of hypertension was reported in the three studies. No grade 4 or 5 hypertension was reported 
in studies AVF0890s and AVF2938g. 
Although a fairly substantial number of patients experienced hypertension, only seven (8%) of the 88 
patients with hypertension in the Bv + IFN arm discontinued bevacizumab therapy compared to none 
in the Pl + IFN arm, and only two Grade 4 hypertension events were reported.  
Thirty-two  (36%)  of  the  88  patients  who  developed  hypertension  in  the  Bv  +  IFN  arm  also  had 
proteinuria reported. For the majority of these patients (30/32; 94%), the hypertension was Grade 1-2 
and  the  proteinuria  Grade  1-3.  Only  two  patients  with  Grade  3-4  hypertension  also  had  proteinuria 
(one Grade 1, one Grade 3). One (4%) of the 28 patients in the Pl + IFN arm who had hypertension 
also had proteinuria (Grade 2 hypertension, Grade 2 proteinuria).  
Blood  pressure  data  collected  throughout  the  BO17705  study  confirmed  the  increased  incidence  of 
hypertension in patients treated with bevacizumab. Forty (12%) patients in the Bv + IFN arm and 10 
(3%)  patients  in  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm  had  at  least  one  systolic  and/or  diastolic  reading  above 
150/100 mmHg. Two of the patients in the Bv + IFN arm and one of the patients in the Pl + IFN had 
severe hypertension (>200/110 mmHg).  
Proteinuria 
The incidence of all grades of proteinuria was higher in the Bv + IFN arm (18%) than in the Pl + IFN 
arm (3%) in study BO17705. Of the 59 patients with proteinuria in the Bv + IFN arm, 27 (46%) had 
Grade  3  proteinuria,  compared  to  none  in  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm.  No  Grade  4  proteinuria  events  were 
reported. Bevacizumab/placebo treatment was discontinued in 16 (27%) of the 59 patients in the Bv + 
IFN  arm  and  in  1 (13%)  of  the  eight  patients  in  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm.  The  relatively  low  number  of 
patients withdrawn from bevacizumab therapy because of proteinuria indicates that for many patients 
the  proteinuria  can  be  managed  relatively  quickly  by  withholding  their  dose  of  bevacizumab  until 
values have returned to within acceptable limits to continue treatment (which was only allowed to take 
place within a 6 week time window). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among all patients with an adverse event of proteinuria, 32/59 (54%) patients in the Bv + IFN arm 
and 1/8 (13%) patients in the Pl + IFN arm had an accompanying hypertension adverse event.  
In study AVF2938g, Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 3/53 (6%) patients in the Bv + Pl arm and in 
2/51  (4%)  patients  in  the  Bv  +  Erl  arm.  In  addition,  two  patients  in  the  Bv  +  Erl  arm  had  Grade  4 
proteinuria;  both  events  were  reported  as  nephrotic  syndrome  and  bevacizumab  therapy  was 
discontinued.  This  study  also  investigated  whether  there  was  a  correlation  between  proteinuria  and 
Grade 3 and 4 hypertension, however, the correlation between the two was not significant (p=0.529). 
Three of the 39 (8%) patients treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q2w in study AVF0890s, and 2/37 
(5%) patients receiving 3 mg/kg q2w arm had Grade 3 proteinuria. There were no reports of Grade 3 
proteinuria in the placebo arm, and no cases of Grade 4 or 5 proteinuria in any of the treatment arms. 
Of 13 patients with Grade 2 or 3 hypertension, 7 (54%) patients also had Grade 2 or 3 proteinuria. Of 
63  patients  with  Grade  0  or  1  hypertension,  10  (16%)  patients  also  had  Grade  2  or  3  proteinuria 
(p=0.007 by Fischer’s exact test).  
Haemorrhage/Bleeding 
The incidence of patients with bleeding events was higher in the Bv + IFN arm (33%) than in the Pl + 
IFN arm (9%) in study BO17705. The majority (>80%) of these events in both treatment arms were 
Grade 1 epistaxis and gingival bleeding, and only nine cases (3%) of Grade 3 bleeding, and no cases 
of Grade 4 bleeding were reported in the Bv + IFN arm.  
Most of the increased incidence in bleeding events reported in the Bv + IFN arm can be accounted for 
by the higher incidence of epistaxis, which is a known toxicity associated with bevacizumab; 27% of 
patients in the Bv + IFN arm compared to 4% of patients in the Pl + IFN arm experienced epistaxis. Of 
the  remaining  bleeding  events,  gingival  bleeding  (4%  vs.  0.3%),  and  to  a  certain  extent  mouth 
haemorrhage (0.9% vs. 0%), were increased in the Bv + IFN arm. These three types of bleeding event 
are considered to be of only minor clinical relevance. Cases of various bleeding or haemorrhage events 
in the gastrointestinal tract were rare, and occurred in only one to two patients.  
Three patients in this study died as a result of their bleeding events; two patients in the Bv + IFN arm 
(haemoptysis in a patient with progressive pulmonary metastases, and a ruptured aneurysm in a patient 
with  an  underlying  aneurysm)  and  one  patient  in  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm  (intracranial  haemorrhage  in  a 
patient with cerebral metastases). All three bleeding events are likely to be related to the underlying 
disease.  
The incidence of bleeding (Grade 3-4) adverse events in study AVF2938g (4%-6%) was similar to that 
seen in the Bv + IFN arm in study BO17705 (3%). There were no deaths due to haemorrhage in either 
treatment arm.  
No cases of ≥ Grade 3 bleeding were reported in any of the treatment arms in study AVF0890s. 
Gastrointestinal Perforation 
Five (1%) cases of a gastrointestinal perforation were reported in study BO17705, and all occurred in 
patients  receiving  Bv  +  IFN  therapy.  All  patients  experiencing  this  event  were  withdrawn  from 
treatment, all events were Grade 3 or 4 and all resolved without sequelae, except for one patient who 
died as a result of a gastric perforation. This patient’s death was considered by the investigator to be 
due to the underlying renal cancer with gastrointestinal tumour involvement. 
One occurrence of a gastrointestinal perforation was reported in the Bv + Erl arm in study AVF2938g 
which resulted in the death of the patient. This patient presented with abdominal pain and diarrhoea, 
and was diagnosed with an ischemic bowel. 
No gastrointestinal perforations were reported in study AVF0890s. 
Thromboembolic Events 
In study BO17705, arterial and venous thromboembolic adverse events were experienced by slightly 
more patients in the Bv + IFN arm (4%) than in the Pl + IFN arm (2%). The difference between the 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two arms was primarily due to venous events, which were reported in 3% of patients in the Bv + IFN 
arm compared to 1% of patients in the Pl + IFN arm. 
Grade  4  venous  thromboembolic  events  occurred  in  four  patients  in  the  Bv  +  IFN  arm  and  in  one 
patient in the Pl + IFN arm, and one patient in the Pl + IFN arm had an arterial thromboembolic event; 
all  events  were  embolisms.  One  case  of  a  pulmonary  embolism  required  discontinuation  of 
bevacizumab  therapy,  as  did  a  further  four  thromboembolic  events  (portal  vein  thrombosis, 
cerebrovascular  accident,  myocardial 
the 
thromboembolic events were fatal 
ischemic  attack).  None  of 
infarction, 
transient 
One arterial thrombotic event (Grade 3 transient ischemic attack) in the Bv + Erl arm, and two venous 
thrombotic events (Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis and a Grade 4 pulmonary embolism) in the Bv + 
Pl were reported in study AVF2938g. No venous thrombotic events were reported in the Bv + Erl arm.  
No thromboembolic events were reported in the publication for study AVF0890s. 
Wound Healing Complications 
Wound  healing  complications  were  rare  in  study  BO17705,  and  well  balanced  between  the  two 
treatment arms (Bv + IFN arm [1.5%]; Pl + IFN arm [1.0%)]. Two of the six events in the Bv + IFN 
arm  were  Grade  3;  a  case  of  skin  graft  failure  requiring  interruption  of  bevacizumab  therapy  and  a 
case of impaired healing which led to bevacizumab being discontinued.  
Two Grade 4 wound healing events occurred in the Bv + Pl arm in study AVF2938g, a fistula (erosion 
into  the bowel  secondary to  tumour  progression)  and  a  non-infectious  wound complication  (chylous 
leak after left modified radical neck dissection).  
No wound healing complication adverse events were reported in the publication of study AVF0890s. 
Congestive Heart Failure 
Two  cases  of  congestive  heart  failure  were  reported  in  study  BO17705,  one  in  the  Bv  +  IFN  arm 
(Grade 3 ventricular dysfunction) and one in the Pl + IFN arm (Grade 2 cardiac failure). One case of 
dyspnoea (Grade 3) in the Bv + Pl arm and one case of ventricular dysfunction (Grade 3) in the Bv + 
Erl  arm  were  reported  in  study  AVF2938g.  No  cases  of  congestive  heart  failure  were  reported  in 
patients treated with bevacizumab monotherapy or placebo in study AVF0890s. 
•  Laboratory findings 
No new safety signals associated with bevacizumab treatment were identified from the laboratory test 
results  in  studies  BO17705  or  AVF2938g.  The  majority  of  post-baseline  abnormalities  for  all 
parameters  were  Grade  1  or  2.  As  expected  from  the  adverse  events  reporting,  Grade  3  proteinuria, 
measured either by dipstick or in a 24-hour urine sample, occurred more often in patients in the Bv + 
IFN arm than in the Pl + IFN arm. 
Raised serum creatinine values (Grade 3 or 4) in study BO17705 were reported rarely (one patient in 
each  treatment  arm),  indicating  that  adding bevacizumab  to  interferon  did  not  adversely affect  renal 
function. 
•  Safety in special populations 
Not performed. 
•  Safety conclusions 
Overall,  bevacizumab  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  in  patients  with  advanced  and/or  mRCC  at  the 
recommended dose of 10 mg/kg q2w in combination with 9 MIU interferon alfa-2a given three times 
weekly. 
In particular, adding interferon to bevacizumab did not appear to increase the incidence of the targeted 
adverse  events  of  hypertension,  proteinuria,  bleeding,  gastrointestinal  perforation,  wound  healing 
complications, thromboembolic events or congestive heart failure, all of which have been previously 
identified as being related to bevacizumab therapy. The incidence of these and other events seen with 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bv  +  IFN  combination  therapy  was  not  greater  that  that  seen  in  the  two  studies  which  had  a 
bevacizumab monotherapy arm, or in studies with bevacizumab in other cancer indications.  
No unexpected safety findings were identified.  
The incidence of well-known AEs related to bevacizumab was not greater than seen in other studies 
with bevacizumab given as monotherapy. However, not surprisingly, more toxicity was reported in the 
Bv+IFN arm, and especially the rate of SAEs and discontinuations was almost doubled when adding 
bevacizumab to the IFN treatment. 
In relation to the well-known safety profiles of bevacizumab and IFN, no synergistic adverse effects 
were induced by combining the treatments, but overall, it appears that the gain in PFS and ORR is at 
the expense of greater toxicity in some of the patients. iv.

OVERALL CONCLUSION AND Benefit-risk assessment 
This application is based on one pivotal Phase III study (BO17795 - ongoing) which investigates the 
use  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  IFN  in  patients  with  advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell 
cancer, and two supportive Phase II studies (AVF2938g and AVF0890s). 
All three studies were multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, of a comparative parallel group design.  
Study  BO17705  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  (10  mg/kg  q2w)  in  combination 
with  interferon  alfa-2a  (target  dose  of  9  MIU  three  times  weekly)  (Bv+IFN)  versus  placebo  and 
interferon  alfa-2a  (Pl+IFN)  as  first  line  treatment  administered  to  nephrectomised  patients  with 
advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (mRCC).  Study  AVF2938g  evaluated  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  bevacizumab  (10  mg/kg  q2w)  in  combination  with  erlotinib  (150  mg  daily)  (Bv  +  Erl) 
compared with bevacizumab plus placebo (Bv + Pl) in patients with metastatic clear-cell RCC. Study 
AVF0890s evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab monotherapy (3.0 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
q2w)  compared  to  placebo  in  patients  with  relapsing  metastatic  clear-cell  RCC  who  had  failed  IL-2 
therapy,  or  in  whom  IL-2  therapy  was  contraindicated.  In  all  three  studies  bevacizumab  was  given 
until  disease  progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity,  and  the  maximum  duration  of  treatment  with 
bevacizumab  was  approximately  24  months.  The  dose  selection  and  the  dose-response  question  of 
bevacizumab  have  still  not  been  resolved.  As  there’s  no  evidence  of  an  association  between  the 
baseline VEGF level and the efficacy of bevacizumab, the Applicant has not been able to justify why 
the  highest  dose  of  bevacizumab  (10  mg/kg  q2w  )  is  required  in  RCC  patients.  Overall,  the  dose-
finding study (AVF0890s) investigated the activity of 3.0 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg q2w bevacizumab as 
single-agent second-line treatment in RCC patients previously treated with IL-2. Therefore, the results 
can  not  directly  be  extrapolated  to  the  proposed  indication,  as  patients  are  expected  to  get  a  better 
response  from  first-line  therapy  plus  additional  benefit  from  IFN.  Furthermore,  the  lack  of 
investigations  of  a 5.0  mg/kg  q2w  bevacizumab  arm  seems  obvious  as  it  theoretically  could  convey 
corresponding  efficacy  but  lower  toxicity  than  the  10  mg/kg  dose.  No  specific,  predictive  factors  of 
toxicity have been identified. Possibility for further investigations on the 5 mg/kg q2w bevacizumab 
dose in combination with IFN for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer 
was  discussed  at  the  CHMP  but  it  was  finally  accepted  that  investigation  of  potentially  predictive 
biomarkers would be way to address such issues.  
the  absence  of  disease  progression,  patients 
In the pivotal study IFN was given for 52 weeks or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
in  study  BO17705  could  continue  with 
In 
bevacizumab/placebo  treatment  alone  for  maximally  52  weeks,  while  upon  evidence  of  disease 
progression  all  study  treatments  were  to  be  discontinued  permanently.  Patients  who  experienced 
protocol-defined  toxicity  to  bevacizumab/placebo  or  interferon  alfa-2a  were  required  to  discontinue 
treatment  with  the  corresponding  agent.  In  cases  where  bevacizumab/placebo  was  discontinued, 
continuation of IFN could be considered. 
The pivotal study (BO17705) included 649 patients, 327 in the Bv+IFN arm and 322 in the Pl+IFN 
arm.  The  study  was  conducted  in  101  centres  in  18  countries  (Eastern  and  Western  Europe  and 
Australasia).  Originally,  the  primary  endpoint  was  to  assess  overall  survival  (OS).  However,  in 
November 2006 the study was unblinded and the primary endpoint was changed to progression free 
survival (PFS), which was originally a secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints were time to 
disease  progression  (TTP),  time  to  treatment  failure  (TTF),  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  and 
23 
 
 
 
 
duration of response (DR). In the two treatment arms, the baseline data of the recruited patients were 
generally  similar  except  for  a  small  difference  in  gender  (27%  women  in  the  Pl+IFN  arm  vs.32% 
women  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm).  The  Motzer  score,  Karnofsky  performance  status,  median  number  of 
disease  sites  per  patient  as  well  as  the  target  lesion  sites  were  all  comparable  between  the  two 
treatment arms. The interim analysis indicated a weak tendency towards an improvement in OS for the 
bevacizumab arm (HR=0.79; p<0.067). There was a statistically and clinically significant increase in 
median PFS, which was almost doubled with Bv+IFN treatment (10.2 months) compared to Pl+IFN 
treatment  (5.4  months)  (HR=0.63  p<0.0001).  There  was  also  a  statistically  significant  difference  in 
median TTP (4.7 months; HR=0.61 p<0.0001) and TTF (3.3 months; HR=0.73 p=0.0003) in favour of 
the Bv+IFN treatment. The ORR was significantly increased in patients treated with Bv+IFN (31%) 
compared  to  those  receiving  treatment  with  Pl+IFN  (13%)  (p<0.0001),  and  the  median  duration  of 
objective response was slightly longer in the Bv+IFN treated patients (13.5 months) compared to the 
Pl+IFN treated patients (11.1 months) (95% CI [0.55, 1.61]). 
No significant change was observed in OS, but the data were not mature at the time of the data cut-off 
for the interim analysis, and the result may have been confounded by the introduction of new second-
line  therapies  during  the  progress  of  the  pivotal  trial.  Therefore,  PFS  is  accepted  as  a  valid  primary 
endpoint with regulatory precedence. Furthermore, the MAH has presented data to support PFS as a 
surrogate for survival and has   demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to IFN does not have a 
negative impact on patients’ performance status before progression, the use of co-medication for pain 
relief or haemoglobin values.  
In  general,  exploratory  subgroup  analyses  of  PFS  in  study  BO17705  showed point  estimates  for  the 
Hazard  Ratio  below  1  in  all  subgroups  examined,  indicating  a  consistent  benefit  in  adding 
bevacizumab to interferon alfa-2a. No conclusions can be made at present for OS in subgroups by age 
as the data are currently immature.   A possible, smaller benefit in the elderly subgroups across studies 
and  indications,  could  be  explained  by  a  limited  number  of  enrolled  patients,  higher  variability  and 
shorter life expectancy in the elderly population.   
Pharmacokinetic  data  from  study  BO17705  are  consistent  with  results  from  previous  studies.  The 
existing  data  suggest  that  bevacizumab  has  no  major  interaction  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  IFN. 
Furthermore, the MAH has demonstrated that neither renal nor hepatic function have an influence on 
bevacizumab exposure. An update of section 5.2 in the SmPC on the available information regarding 
the distribution, metabolism and excretion of bevacizumab is requested.  
Comparison of data across the three studies BO17705, AVF0890s and AVF2938g, is complicated by 
differences  in  treatment  regimens,  patient  populations,  and  durations  of  treatment.  Nevertheless,  the 
available data from the pivotal study BO17705 and the supportive study AVF0890s showed that the 
PFS  was  almost  doubled  for  patients  receiving  bevacizumab  treatment  compared  to  patients  in  the 
placebo group. Furthermore, in study AVF2938g the PFS observed with bevacizumab as monotherapy 
was  approximately  80%  of  the  PFS  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm  of  the  BO17705  study  (8.5  and  10.2, 
respectively).  
Thus,  from  the  submitted  documentation  a  prolongation  of  PFS  and  an  improvement  in  objective 
response  rate  was  observed  for  patients  receiving  bevacizumab  treatment  (10  mg/kg/q2w).  This 
should, however, be confirmed by an independent review of tumour assessments. 
The  regimen  of  10  mg/kg  2qw  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  IFN  has  demonstrated  clinically 
significant efficacy, and has proven an acceptable safety profile, whereas a lower dose of bevacizumab 
(3 mg/kg q2w) had not resulted in a clinically meaningful benefit. The MAH commits to investigate 
on  modeling  and  simulation  of  the  Dose  –  Tumor  response  over  time.  In  particular,  the  MAH  will 
evaluate the dose-tumor size response relationship using a mathematical model characterizing the dose 
effect of Avastin on Tumor progression. It is envisaged that this model can be build using the Phase II 
study (AVF0890s) data which investigates the placebo, 3 mg/kg 2qw and 10 mg/kg q2w and the Phase 
III  study  (BO17705)  data  which  investigated  IFN  and  10  mg/kg  q2w  bevacizumab  +  IFN.  It  is 
anticipated that the model developed can be used to evaluate the expected tumour size response over 
time following 5 mg/kg 2qw bevacizumab + IFN.

The MAH has proposed an indication which includes both advanced and metastatic RCC. According 
to  the  inclusion  criteria  the  patients  should  present  with  metastatic  clear-cell  RCC.  In  the  study 
population, both patients with locally advanced disease and metastatic disease were analysed. It seems 
reasonable  to  include  both  advanced  and  metastatic  disease  in  the  indication.  Furthermore,  the 
indication  should  not  be  restricted  to  nephrectomised  patients.  Limited  data  and  the  mechanism  of 
action of bevacizumab indicate that patients, who do not undergo nephrectomy, will also benefit from 
treatment with bevacizumab.    
In  conclusion,  the  pivotal  study  BO17705  demonstrated  a  substantial  increase  in  median  PFS  (10.2 
months  versus  5.4  months)  and  ORR  (31.4%  versus  12.8%)  when  bevacizumab  was  added  to  IFN 
compared to placebo+IFN in the treatment of patients with mRCC. Thereby, bevacizumab+IFN offer a 
treatment effect that is better than IFN as single-agent therapy and in line with the effect of tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors in first-line therapy.  
A  total  of  517  patients  with  mRCC  were  exposed  to  at  least  one  dose  of  bevacizumab  in  the  three 
studies; BO17705, AVF2938g and AVF0890s. Generally, there were no unexpected toxicities with the 
use  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  IFN  in  study  BO17705.  The  principal  risks  shown  to  be 
associated  with  bevacizumab  in  the  pivotal  study  were  an  increase  in  Grade  ≥  3  proteinuria, 
hypertension,  bleeding,  and  gastrointestinal  perforation.  Other  targeted  adverse  events  which  also 
showed  an  increased  incidence  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm  were  arterial  thromboembolic  events,  wound 
healing  complications  and  CHF.  However,  in  all  three  cases,  the  incidence  in  both  study  arms  was 
≤ 1%.  Furthermore,  other  Grade    ≥  3  events  with  an  increase  in  absolute  incidence  of  >  1%  in  the 
bevacizumab arm compared to the control arm in study BO17705 were fatigue, asthenia, depression, 
neutropenia and venous thromboembolic events. 
A total of five bevacizumab-treated patients died as  a result of  a  targeted adverse event in the three 
studies;  two  patients  due  to  GI  perforation  (studies  BO17705  and  AVF2938g),  two  patients  due  to 
bleeding (both BO17705), and one patient due to myocardial infarction (study BO17705).  
In  summary,  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  experienced  in  patients  that  were  treated  with 
bevacizumab+IFN was higher than in patients treated with placebo+IFN. The adverse events reported 
most  often  in  the  bevacizumab+IFN  group  were  toxicities  known  to  be  caused  by  IFN  treatment 
including pyrexia, anorexia, fatigue, asthenia, and nausea. Established bevacizumab-specific toxicities 
like  bleeding  (mainly  epistaxis),  hypertension,  proteinuria,  gastrointestinal  perforations  and 
thromboembolic events also showed a much higher incidence in the bevacizumab+IFN arm compared 
to  the  Pl  +  IFN  arm,  as  expected,  but  they  were  no  more  frequent  than  previously  reported  from 
studies  in  other  indications.  Grade  3-4  adverse  events  were  reported  for  IFN  frequently,  but  the 
incidence of serious adverse events and discontinuations almost doubled in the bevacizumab+IFN arm 
compared  to  the  control  arm.  Nevertheless,  the  median  duration  of  treatment  remained  significantly 
longer  in  the  Bv+IFN  arm  compared  to  the  Pl+IFN  arm.  Deaths  were  mainly  due  to  progressive 
disease. No new safety concerns were identified. 
Overall,  a  clinical  benefit  to  the  patients  has  been  established,  why  the  benefit/risk  balance  of 
bevacizumab + IFN in the treatment of mRCC is considered positive. Although increased toxicity was 
observed  when  combining  bevacizumab  with  IFN,  the  safety  profiles  of  both  drugs  are  well 
established and the combination regimen did not lead to unexpected safety findings.   
The  three  key  issues  relevant  for  assessing  similarity  with  orphan  medicinal  products  approved  in 
RCC  setting  are  molecular  structural  features,  mechanism  of  action  and  therapeutic  indication.  The  
conclusion of non-similarity regarding molecular structure and mechanism of action is supported.  
In conclusion, a clear clinical benefit to the patients can be established and the benefit/risk balance of 
bevacizumab + IFN in the treatment of mRCC is overall considered positive, given the urgent need for 
additional treatment options in this population of cancer patients with a very poor prognosis. Although 
increased  toxicity  was  observed  when  combining  bevacizumab  with  IFN,  the safety  profiles  of  both 
drugs are well established and the combination regimen did not lead to unexpected safety findings.

The overall Benefit/Risk assessment of bevacizumab in combination with interferon alfa-2a is for the 
first line treatment of patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer is positive. The MAH 
will also provide a survival update for study BO17705. 
The MAH will perform an independent retrospective review of the tumour assessments done in study 
BO17705  with  the objective  to  collect all  images  from  all  patients  enrolled  in  the  study.  Due  to  the 
retrospective  nature  of  this  review,  it  is  not  expected  that  it  will  be  possible  to  obtain  all  images; 
however, every effort will be made to obtain images from as many evaluable patients as possible.

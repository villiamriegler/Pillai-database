2.  Introduction 
Spikevax (also referred to as COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna and mRNA-1273) is currently indicated for 
active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 years of age and older. 
Spikevax is administered as a course of two 100 microgram doses to individuals 12 years of age and 
older and to children 6 through 11 years of age as a course of two 50 microgram doses, which is half of 
the primary dose for individuals 12 years and older. A third dose of Spikevax may be given at least 28 
days after the second dose to individuals 12 years of age and older (100 micrograms) and children 6 
through 11 years (50 micrograms) who are severely immunocompromised. 
A booster dose of Spikevax (50 µg) given at least 3 months after completion of the primary series is 
currently approved for adults 18 years of age and older. 
Within the present submission the MAH requests to extend the use of a 50 μg booster dose of Spikevax to 
adolescents (12 to < 18 years) at a dosing interval of at least 3 months after completion of the primary 
series with Spikevax (homologous boost) to prevent COVID-19. The submission is mostly based on the 
extrapolation of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) to 
the adolescent target age group. 
3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects

Primary Series Adults ≥18 Years in Study P301 
The safety and efficacy of mRNA-1273 to prevent COVID-19 was demonstrated in adults 18 years and 
older in Study P301. The final efficacy analysis of Part A (blinded phase) based on a database lock of 04 
May 2021 demonstrated VE of 93.2% (95% CI: 91.0, 94.8, p < 0.0001), which was consistent with 
results of the interim and primary analyses, confirming persistent, high efficacy over a substantially larger 
case database and over a median 5.3-month blinded observation period from randomisation in Part A. 
Booster Vaccination in Adults and Young Adults - Study P201B 
Serum neutralising titers were measured after the 50 μg booster vaccination, meeting pre-specified 
criteria for non-inferiority (NI) in terms of GMTs (relative to neutralising titers observed after a 2-dose 
primary series with 100 μg mRNA-1273 in P301). In addition, if assay-specific definitions for 
seroresponse were employed, both coprimary endpoints met the pre-specified success criteria for NI, 
indicating the primary immunogenicity objective was met. A single dose of 50 μg of mRNA-1273 in the 
P201B study also demonstrated 32- to 44 fold increases in nAb responses against all test variants as 
compared to pre-boost nAB titers, including a 42-fold increase against the Delta variant. 
Table 2 summarises serum nAb (PsVNA median infectious dose [ID50], D614G) titers 28 days after the 
50 μg booster in P201 Part B. Among all participants previously receiving 2 doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273, 
the 50 μg booster led to an increase in baseline titers, GMFR (28 days post booster to pre-dose 1) of 
12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29). In a recent ad-hoc analysis focusing on the 18- to 25-year age group, 
although containing a small number of participants (n=7), the 50 μg booster post 100 μg primary series 
led to an increase in baseline titers, with GMFR (28 days post booster to pre-dose 1) of 16.32 (95% CI: 
4.53, 58.81).

Immunobridging: Comparison of P201 Part B Booster to P301 Primary Series 
Against the Original Virus Strain 
In comparison to the peak PsVNA ID50 titers in P301 Part A (Day 57), where efficacy was demonstrated, 
the geometric mean ratio detected in P201 Part B (GMR; P201 Part B D29 vs P301 D57, against the 
original virus strain) was 1.71 (95% CI: 1.519, 1.929). The GMR estimate of 1.71 (above the pre-
specified threshold of 1.0), with the lower bound of the 95% CI greater than 0.67 (corresponding to 
NIM=1.5) met the pre-specified NI criterion. 
A consistent trend to that observed from the analysis described above, with the 2 prime series groups 
combined, was also observed in the subgroup analysis (by prime series). In participants who were primed 
with a 2-dose series of 100 μg of mRNA-1273, the GMR (P201 Part B vs P301) was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.496, 
2.060); and in participants who were primed with a 2-dose series of 50 μg of mRNA-1273, the GMR was 
1.66 (95% CI: 1.412, 1.958) (Table 3).

DMID 21-0012 Study 
Results of the DMID 21-0012 study using a booster dose of mRNA-1273 both 50 μg and 100 μg, (i) 
reinforce findings observed after the 50 μg boosting dose (P201 Part B), and (ii) demonstrate the utility of 
mRNA-1273 regardless of the COVID-19 vaccine initially administered.  
Comparing GMT obtained 12 - 20 weeks after 2 doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 with GMT obtained 14 days 
after a 100 μg booster dose, show a significant increase in nAb titers with a GMFR of 10.17 following the 
booster dose (95%: 8.05, 12.85). This GMFR is consistent with that observed in earlier sections for the 
50 μg booster, (GMFR 12.99, 95% CI: 11.04, 15.29).  
Data from this study also illustrate that a booster dose of mRNA-1273 can significantly enhance nAb 
responses induced by alternate primary vaccination regimens, regardless of the vaccine used for priming. 
Study participants had completed authorised regimens of the Janssen (n=52 participants) or 
Pfizer/BioNTech (n=50 participants) 12-20 weeks prior to obtaining a “baseline” serum sample. Of note, 
these “baseline” GMTs measured in these groups were lower than that following the authorised 2-dose 
Moderna regimen (366.31 following Moderna compared with 36.81 following Janssen and 102.44 
following Pfizer/BioNTech). Regardless of the initial vaccine regimen, boosting with 50 or 100 μg dose of 
mRNA-1273 resulted in a significant increase in nAb titer. 
In line with the results from P201 Part B, the older adult cohort aged ≥56 years had a GMFR consistent 
with the younger age cohort 18-55 years of age.  
GMFRs comparing GMT after different primary vaccination schemes prior to the 100 μg mRNA-1273 
booster to the GMT 14 days after mRNA-1273 booster were 75.91 (prime Janssen), 10.17 (prime 
Moderna) and 31.69 (prime Pfizer/BioNTech). These results emphasise that fold increase is influenced by 
baseline titers: 2 doses of mRNA-1273 achieved relatively high “baseline” titers (366.31) compared with 
“baseline” titers achieved by either the Janssen or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines (36.81 and 102.44, 
respectively). The relatively higher titers achieved after 2 doses of 100 μg of mRNA-1273 result in a 
relatively lower GMFR than for participants initially given Janssen or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines (86% vs 
100%, respectively).

Post-licensure Booster Vaccine Effectiveness 
A prospective cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California was conducted to determine the 
real-world vaccine effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in preventing COVID-19 infection and severe disease. 
Individuals aged ≥ 18 years receiving 2 doses of mRNA-1273 ≥ 24 days apart (18 Dec 2020 - 31 Mar 
2021) were 1:1 matched to randomly selected unvaccinated individuals by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, 
with follow-up through 30 Jun 2021. Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 infection was 87.4% (84.8%-
89.6%). Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 hospitalisation and hospital death was 95.8% (90.7%-98.1%) 
and 97.9% (66.9%-99.9%), respectively. Vaccine efficacy was higher against symptomatic (88.3% 
[98.3% CI: 86.1%-90.2%]) than asymptomatic COVID-19 (72.7% [53.4%-84.0%]), but was generally 
similar across age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups. Vaccine efficacy among individuals with history of 
COVID-19 ranged from 8.2% to 33.6%. Among those aged 14 to 44 years at index date, the incidence 
per 1000 person-years was 3.58 (2.92-4.39) among mRNA-1273 vaccinated participants with an adjusted 
VE of 87.2% (83.6%-90.1%) The most prevalent variants were Alpha (41.6%), Epsilon (17.5%), Delta 
(11.5%), and Gamma (9.1%), with Delta increasing to 54.0% of variants by June 2021.  
A retrospective cohort study conducted in Qatar among over 2.2 million persons vaccinated with 2 doses 
was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of booster vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. 
For mRNA-1273, cumulative symptomatic infection incidence was 1.9% (95% CI: 1.7-2.2) in the booster-
dose cohort and 3.5% (95% CI: 3.2-3.9) in the primary series cohort, after 35 days of follow-up. The 
adjusted hazard ratio for symptomatic infection was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.43-0.57). Booster effectiveness 
relative to primary series was 50.8% (95% CI: 43.4-57.3). There were fewer cases of severe COVID-19 
in booster dose cohorts than in primary series cohorts, but cases of severe COVID-19 were rare in all 
cohorts indicating booster vaccination is associated with modest effectiveness against symptomatic 
infection with Omicron. 
Another study including all ages eligible for vaccination (including young adults) that investigated the 
association between 3 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with 
Omicron and Delta variants using a test-negative case—control analysis. In an analysis that included age 
matched cases and controls a comparison of 3 doses versus 2 doses among Omicron cases and controls, 
the adjusted odds ratio (OR) versus 2 doses was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.32-0.36); among Delta cases and 
controls, the adjusted OR was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.14 0.14- < 0.001). When models were stratified by mRNA 
product, the adjusted ORs for Omicron were 0.35 (95% CI: 0.32-0.37) for 3 doses of BNT162b2 versus 2 
doses and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.28-0.34) for 3 doses of mRNA-1273 versus 2 doses. For Delta, the adjusted 
ORs were 0.17 (95% CI: 0.16-0.19) for 3 doses of BNT162b2 versus 2 doses and 0.13 (95% CI: 
0.110.15) for 3 doses of mRNA-1273 versus 2 doses. Q values for all comparisons (Omicron vs Delta) of 
product-specific ORs were less than 0.001 doses (vs 2 doses), with values closer to 0 representing a 
stronger magnitude of association. 
Primary Series Adolescents (12 to <18 Years) 
Vaccine effectiveness in adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years was inferred by demonstrating non-
inferiority of both serum nAb GMTs and seroresponse rates (SRR) from adolescents compared with those 
from young adults enrolled in Study P301 (aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 25 years (Table 4). The GMR of adolescent 
(Study P203) to young adult (Study P301) nAb titers at Day 57 was 1.077 (95% CI: 0.939, 1.236), 
meeting the pre-specified 1.5-fold non-inferiority criterion (i.e., lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR is > 
0.67). The difference in adolescent to young adult nAb SRRs at Day 57 was 0.2 (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4), 
meeting the pre-specified 10% non-inferiority criterion (lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference 
is > -10%). Since both coprimary endpoints of Study P203 met the pre-specified success criteria for non-
inferiority, the primary immunogenicity objective is considered to be met.

Evidence from related previously completed regulatory procedures  
Relevant data and regulatory assessments from the following previous procedures related to the 
indication definition of Spikevax were taken into consideration for decision making in the present 
procedure 
-  EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021: Extension of indication for primary immunisation to adolescents 12 - < 
18 years of age 
-  EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0042: Indication for heterologous boost in adults 18 years of age and older 
3.2.  Discussion on Immunogenicity and Efficacy 
In support of the claimed booster indication for adolescents, the MAH has compiled evidence from several 
data sources as summarised below: 
The MAH reports for pivotal study P301 that the final efficacy analysis of Part A (blinded phase) based on 
a database lock of 04 May 2021 demonstrated VE of 93.2%. Although no correlate of protection has been 
defined yet, the results of this huge study lay the basis to apply nAB titers as an immunological indicator 
of vaccine efficacy.  
Regarding booster vaccination in study P201 Part B the MAH reports that potent serum neutralising titers 
were measured after the 50 μg booster vaccination, meeting pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority (NI) 
in terms of GMTs (relative to neutralising titers observed after a 2-dose primary series with 100 μg

mRNA-1273 in P301). These results are obtained in the overall study populations, i.e. adults ≥18 years of 
age. However, in a recent ad-hoc analysis focusing on the 18- to 25-year age group of study P201 Part B, 
although containing only a small number of participants (n=7), the 50 μg booster post 100 μg primary 
series led to an increase in baseline titers, with GMFR (28 days post booster to pre-dose 1) of 16.32 
(95% CI: 4.53, 58.81). These data, although rather limited at this point in time, show that the 50 µg 
boost is working in principle in young adults.  
For the purpose of immunobridging a comparison of peak PsVNA ID50 titers has been performed between 
P201 Part B (adults ≥18 years of age) and the pivotal study P301 (adults ≥18 years of age). When 
compared to the peak PsVNA ID50 titers in P301 Part A (Day 57 post primary vaccination with 2 vaccine 
doses), where clinical efficacy was demonstrated, the geometric mean ratio in relation to PsVNA ID50 
titers of P201 Part B after a 50 µg booster dose (GMR; P201 Part B D29 vs P301 D57) was 1.71 (95% CI: 
1.519, 1.929). The lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 0.67 (corresponding to NIM=1.5) thus 
successfully meeting the pre-specified NIM criterion. These data indicate that applying a 50 µg booster 
dose is highly effective to increase post-primary vaccination nAB titers. 
Study DMID 21-0012 is investigating efficacy and immunogenicity of a heterologous boost in adults ≥18 
years of age. The MAH reports that GMT for nAB obtained 12 - 20 weeks after primary immunisation with 
2 doses of 100 μg each mRNA-1273 compared to GMT obtained 14 days after a 100 μg booster dose 
(homologous boost using 100 µg mRNA-1273) are significantly lower. This demonstrates that the 100 µg 
boost lads to a significant increase in nAb titers with a GMFR of 10.17 (95%: 8.05, 12.85). GMFRs in 
response to booster vaccination were also specified in terms of the primary vaccination scheme applied: 
GMFRs comparing GMT prior to the 100 μg mRNA-1273 booster to the GMT 14 days after mRNA-1273 
booster were 75.91 (prime with Janssen), 10.17 (prime with Moderna) and 31.69 (prime with 
Pfizer/BioNTech). These results emphasise that fold increase is influenced by baseline titers: 2 doses of 
mRNA-1273 achieved relatively high “baseline” titers (366.31) compared with “baseline” titers achieved 
by either the Janssen or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines (36.81 and 102.44, respectively). These data show that 
a Spikevax booster dose increases pre-boost nAB irrespective of the primary vaccination scheme, 
underlining the basic applicability the heterologous boost approach. 
Post-licensure analysis demonstrates 87.4% vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection in 
individuals ≥18 years of age after receiving 2 doses of mRNA-1273. Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 
hospitalisation and hospital death was 95.8% and 97.9%, respectively. 
A retrospective cohort study conducted in Qatar among over 2.2 million persons vaccinated with 2 doses 
was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of booster vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. 
Booster effectiveness relative to primary series was 50.8% (95% CI: 43.4-57.3).  
Another study including all ages eligible for vaccination (including young adults) that investigated the 
association between 3 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with 
Omicron and Delta variants using a test-negative case—control analysis. In an analysis that included age 
matched cases and controls a comparison of 3 doses versus 2 doses among Omicron cases and controls, 
the adjusted odds ratio (OR) versus 2 doses was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.32-0.36); among Delta cases and 
controls, the adjusted OR was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.14 0.14- < 0.001). 
The MAH further reports an immunobridging as determined by nAB titers and seroresponse rates after 
primary vaccination from studies P203 (adolescent ≥12 years to <18 years) with young adults from study 
P301 (≥18 to <25 years of age). Vaccine effectiveness in adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years was 
inferred by demonstrating non-inferiority of both serum nAb GMTs and seroresponse rates (SRR) from 
adolescents compared with those from young adults enrolled in Study P301 (aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 25 years).

The GMR of adolescent (Study P203) to young adult (Study P301) nAb titers at Day 57 was 1.077 (95% 
CI: 0.939, 1.236), meeting the pre-specified 1.5-fold non-inferiority criterion (i.e., lower bound of the 
95% CI for GMR is > 0.67). The difference in adolescent to young adult nAb SRRs at Day 57 was 0.2 
(95% CI: -1.8, 2.4), meeting the pre-specified 10% non-inferiority criterion (lower bound of the 95% CI 
of the SRR difference is > -10%). Since both co-primary endpoints of Study P203 met the pre-specified 
success criteria for non-inferiority, the primary immunogenicity objective is met. These data indicate that 
the vaccine-induced immune response in terms of nAB titers after primary vaccination in adolescents is 
similar to that in young adults. These data are of crucial importance as they confirm the equivalence 
(non-inferiority) of the immune response in these two age groups, which is the scientific/regulatory basis 
for the extrapolation of the immune response after applying a booster dose from young adults to 
adolescents. 
Assessor´s comment: 
No specific data for efficacy, immunogenicity or effectiveness have been provided by the MAH for the 
claimed indication of a 50 µg booster dose in the adolescent age group. However, relevant evidence from 
various studies and data sources have been compiled in support of the claim for the adolescent boost. As 
a whole, these data are considered qualified to justify the claim for the extension of the current booster 
indication for Spikevax to adolescents. In particularly the comparison of vaccine-induced nAB titers after 
primary vaccination in young adults and adolescents confirm the equivalence of the measured immune 
responses in these two age groups. There is currently no scientifically justified reason to assume that 
booster immune responses in these two age groups should differ significantly while primary vaccination 
responses are highly comparable. 
Therefore, extrapolation of immunogenicity data from the older age group ≥18 to <25 years to the 
younger age group ≥12 to <18 years is deemed acceptable. 
Study P203 Part 1A was a Phase 2/3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluates 
the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in healthy adolescents. The goal 
of the study is to support an indication for use of mRNA-1273 (100 μg IM, given as 2 doses, 28 days 
apart) in the 12 to < 18 years of age group. The blinded placebo controlled portion of this study was 
submitted and approved under procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021. 
A data snapshot for this submission was triggered (date: 08 May 2021) based on the availability of 
immunogenicity data from Study P203, with a median study follow-up duration of 53 days after dose 2, 
based on a total of 3732 participants (3726 participants randomised and receiving dose 1, with 1240 on 
placebo and 2486 on mRNA-1273).  
The protocol for study P203 was amended to include Part C, which will evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose of 50 μg of mRNA-1273. Part C is designed to offer homologous 
booster vaccine to active participants of the study and heterologous booster dose vaccine to non-Moderna 
primed eligible participants who will be enrolled into the study. A more recent amendment included a Part 
2, which will evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a 50 µg dose of mRNA-1273 given as primary series 
and a booster dose. 
The booster portion of the clinical trial (P203 Part C) is on-going (first subject dosed late December 2021) 
(Protocol Amendment #3). The generation of an interim analysis on at least the first 1000 subjects 
boosted with at least 2 months follow-up post booster, and corresponding regulatory submission package 
is currently planned for Q3 2022.

Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH was asked to provide additional information on the status of study P203 Part C regarding 
timelines and availability of interim or final study reports. 
The MAH clarified that mRNA-1273 is being studied in adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age in the US in 
Study mRNA 1273-P203 (hereafter Study P203), a Phase 2/3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo 
controlled study that evaluates the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in 
healthy adolescents. The goal of the study was to support an indication for use of mRNA-1273 (100 μg 
IM, given as 2 doses, 28 days apart) in the 12 to < 18 years of age group. The blinded placebo controlled 
portion of this study was submitted and approved under procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021. As per 
protocol upon FDA granting an EUA in the adolescent age group (for a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine other 
than mRNA-1273), subjects were unblinded and crossed over. 
Recently, protocol Amendment #3 was implemented to provide a 50 μg booster dose (BD) of mRNA-1273 
to all participants This change was prompted by the authorisation of a 50 ug booster dose for adults 18 
years and older, supported by data from study P201B. The use of mRNA-1273 as a booster dose regimen 
in adolescents (12 - <18 years of age) is currently investigated in clinical study P203 Part C. 
The booster portion of the clinical trial (P203 Part C) is on-going (first subject dosed late December 2021) 
(Protocol Amendment #3). 
The generation of an interim analysis on at least the first 1000 subjects boosted with at least 2 months 
follow-up post booster, and corresponding regulatory submission package is currently planned for Q3 
2022. 
Conclusion: 
The issue is partly resolved. The MAH provided information on the status as requested. Interim data for 
this study are expected in Q3. The MAH is requested to submit the interim and the final clinical study 
report from study P203 Part C as soon as it becomes available. The interim CSR is expected Q3 2022. 
The MAH was requested to comment on the proposed boosting interval for adolescents, 
considering the slower rate decline of the immune response and the duration of protection in 
this population. 
The MAH explained that the booster data on shortened intervals is being extrapolated from the NIH/DMID 
21-0012 study, which included young adults (18-25yr), Study P201B, and post-authorisation safety data, 
in order to provide regulatory agency flexibility to best meet their local dosing interval recommendations. 
It is also important to note, that current post-authorisation safety data, does not distinguish the different 
dosing intervals that have been recommended for booster implementation in different countries, for 
example, France (3 months), Germany (3 months), UK (3 months), Canada - Ontario (3 months), 
Switzerland (4 months), and U.S. (5 months). By providing flexibility in the dosing interval, the decision 
when and for whom to implement a third dose of Spikevax can be made based on local recommending 
bodies needs and the evolution of the pandemic. 
In summary the MAH’s response is not satisfactory. The MAH justifies the booster interval of 3 months in 
adolescents with the extrapolation approach from young adults, without discussing the slower rate decline 
of immune response and the duration of protection in this population as requested. This should be done 
subsequently. The MAH is asked to submit and discuss: 
•all available immunogenicity data comparing the decline of antibodies in adolescents and young adults 
18-25 years of age beyond of the data from study P203 
•all available data on the duration of protection in the 2 age cohorts 
•to justify the identical booster interval for the 2 groups.

Conclusion 
Issue not solved. The MAH is asked to submit and discuss: 
•all available immunogenicity data comparing the decline of antibodies in adolescents and young adults 
18-25 years of age beyond of the data from study P203 
•all available data on the duration of protection in the 2 age cohorts

3.3.  Population IS/ID Model  
Methods and Model diagnostics 
Besides exploratory analysis of nAB levels, a population Immunostimulation/Immunodynamic (IS/ID) 
model to characterise the dynamics of the neutralising antibody (nAB) responses following vaccination 
with different doses of mRNA-1273 has been developed. The model was used to evaluate a 50 µg booster 
for the adolescent population (12-18 years of age) after a 100 µg prime dose. No clinical efficacy data are 
available for this age group following a booster dose. As observed data across various dose levels in all 
age groups are not available from clinical studies, the IS/ID model developed using data pooled across 
different dose levels and age groups was intended to allow for interpolating nAB titers at dose levels not 
evaluated in clinical studies at specific dose and age group. 
Software 
The population IS/ID model was developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling (NLMEM) software 
Pumas (version 2.0.3; Pumas-AI Inc, Baltimore, MD, USA). Estimation was performed by first-order 
conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI). Nonparametric bootstrap was used to quantify parameter 
uncertainty. Pumas (v2.0.3) and Julia language (version 1.6.2) used on JuliaHub (version 5.3; Julia 
Computing, Inc.), were used for data preparation, graphical analysis, model diagnostics, and statistical 
summaries. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The use of non-linear mixed effects modelling for the population approach is endorsed. The MAH has 
used the Software PUMAS, that is not standard in this regard. The reporting of the used model and 
model outcome is not in line with the current EMA guideline on pop PK (CHMP/EWP/185990/06). 
Data used for model building 
The IS/ID analysis included a total of 2781 subjects pooled across P201 Part B, P203, P204 and P301 
clinical studies, of which 63.5 (%) received the 100 μg dose [age groups: 6-12, 12-18 and >18 years of 
age], 30.92(%) received the 50 μg dose [age groups: 6-12 and 2-6] and 5.57 (%) received the 25 μg 
dose [age groups:2-6 and 6months – 2 years of age]. Log10 transformed nAB titers (LogPSVN50) data 
was obtained from clinical studies P201, P301, P203, P204. All per protocol subjects with available dosing 
history and at least 1 measurable titer were included in the analysis dataset. 
Only per protocol subjects were included and only those observation with actual measurements, not 
imputed, after a vaccine dose of mRNA-1273 were included in the analysis. In the source datasets, if an 
nAB titer for a recorded sample was missing, the record was flagged and kept in the dataset with an 
imputed value of 9.26. In the modelling data sets these imputed values were removed since such 
imputed values at random would not contribute to the analysis and hence were removed. Similarly, if the 
dose amount was missing for a dose associated with a recorded nAB and the dose amount could not be 
imputed, the affected nAB titer was deleted.

nAB measurements reported as below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were excluded from the 
analysis irrespective of whether these were pre-dose or post-dose nAB titers time points. 
Outliers were identified by visual inspection of exploratory plots and by looking at conditional weighted 
residuals (CWRES) from the final base model. Observations with absolute value of CWRES greater than 6 
were considered outliers. To determine whether these outliers would cause unnecessary bias in the 
parameter estimates, the outliers were excluded from the analysis dataset and the base model 
parameters were re-estimated. If the model’s structural parameters estimated with the dataset in which 
the outliers had been removed did not differ by more than 15% from parameters estimated with the 
complete dataset, then the complete dataset was retained for all further model development steps. 
A total of 2781 subjects pooled across P201 Part B, P203, P204 and P301 clinical studies, of which 63.5 
(%) received the 100 μg dose [age groups: 6-12, 12-18 and >18 years of age], 30.92(%) received the 
50 μg dose [age groups: 6-12 and 2-6] and 5.57 (%) received the 25 μg dose [age groups:2-6 and 
6months – 2 years of age] were used for model-based nAB analysis. Data for primary vaccination 
comprised three doses and subjects ranged from 6 month of age to elderly. Data on booster dosing is 
only available from P201 Part B (adult subjects, 50 and 100 µg doses). 
The MAH stated that BLQ values as well as those values classified as outliers and imputed values have 
been deleted from the nAB data set, however no % values or numbers of excluded values have been 
provided. The MAH is asked to provide the original data set and should indicate the excluded values per 
study and reason for exclusion. The MAH should further discuss the use of appropriate methods in 
order to justify the exclusion of observed values. (OC)

Model structure and Assumptions used for model building 
The model structure to describe the nAB titer dynamics was developed by adapting the modelling 
framework used by Rhodes et al. entitled: Using vaccine Immunostimulation/Immunodynamic modelling 
methods to inform vaccine dose decision making. Ordinary differential equations were used to describe 
the mechanisms. 
The antibody titer dynamics were attributed to several populations of B cells following vaccine 
administration. The B cell populations included active B cells, plasma cells (short-lived and long-lived) and 
memory B cells. The effect of mRNA-1273 dose was implemented on the rate at which B cells are 
activated (δ) and number of memory B cells that could be generated after vaccination using a linear 
function. δ was initiated at time of primary and re-vaccination and was assumed to be the same at all 
vaccination points. 
Here 
 is a scalar that scales the shape of the activated B cell recruitment rate parameter, δ. An increase 
in 
 is expected to increase the magnitude of the Activated B cell population and therefore the response

𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐
𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟
Different drug effect (effect of mRNA dose on δ) relationships were tested (linear, Emax) and it was 
concluded that the dose-response relationship was best described by a linear model. The Gaussian 
equation time of peak (
) was fixed to 5 days, based on observation of the available data. 
The structural model included activation of B-cells following first vaccine dose which then entered the 
𝑏𝑏
“Active B cells and Plasma cells (Short-lived) population”, at rate δ. Equation 2 represents AB1, the pool 
of activated B cells. These cells then either died, at rate μ, or transitioned into memory B cells, at rate 
βAB, or differentiated to LLPCs, at rate βLL. This transition rate to LLPCs (βLL) was estimated to be 
different after each re-vaccination. 
Active B cells and SLPC lifespan are roughly equivalent and SLPCs are associated with early response with 
significantly less delay compared to LLPCs. Thus, SLPCs are not modelled as a separate compartment and 
are pooled in the activated B cell compartment (Active B cells Plasma cells (Short-lived)). 
Equation 3 represents memory B cell formation on vaccination. During primary response/1st dose of 
vaccine the memory cells are formed from the activated B cell pool. Memory B cells were assumed to die, 
at rate μMB, and LLPCs were also assumed to die, at rate μLL. First vaccine dose has an impact on only 
the formation of memory B cells. The second vaccine dose has an impact on impact on both formation 
and proliferation (
) of memory B cells.

Upon re-vaccination due to the second dose, in addition to primary response a recall response driven by 
previously created memory B cells with high-affinity receptors is initiated. The primed memory B cells 
proliferate and differentiate (compartment (Memory B cells)) immediately to form LLPCs that secrete 
antibodies. A fraction of memory B cells move back into the germinal centre for further maturity affinity 
training. This is known as the anamnestic response. As the memory B cells are primed to the antigen 
during the 1st dose of vaccination, the response now is rapid as their activation threshold is lower. Thus, 
response is quicker as they quickly generate LLPCs of higher quality leading to greater amplitude of 
secreted antibodies. 
Following re-vaccination, two process were initiated simultaneously in the model: First, memory B cells 
replicated at a rate RMB for τ days (equation 4). Following replication, memory B cells differentiated to 
LLPC. These cells enter the “AB2 pool of activated B cell” population (compartment (Active B cells and 
Plasma (Short-lived) cells), at rate βMB. The number of memory B cells that could be generated after 
vaccination was dependent on the vaccine dose and was limited to a maximum by controlling the 
proliferation rate of memory B cells (RMB) using the following equations:

As with primary vaccination, B cells were again activated and entered the Activated B cells compartment,

at rate δ2 compartment (Active B cells Plasma (Short-lived) cells), then either died, at rate μ, or 
transitioned into memory B cells (MB) at rate βAB, or differentiated to LLPCs, at rate βLL2. 
The production rate of LLPC is βLL1 and this production rate to LLPCs (βLL) was estimated to be different 
after re-vaccination βLL2, essentially at a faster rate. LLPCs were assumed to die, at rate μLL.

were free to be estimated. 
For booster response, as with primary and secondary vaccination, B cells were again activated and 
entered the Activated B cells compartment, at rate δ3 (compartment (Active B cells Plasma (Short-lived) 
cells), then either died, at rate μ, or transitioned into memory B cells (MB) at rate βAB, or differentiated 
to LLPCs, at rate βLL3. 
Upon booster dose administration the pool of memory B cells formed after vaccination are replicated at a 
rate RMB for τ days (equation 4). Following replication, memory B cells differentiated to LLPC (LL3). 
These cells enter the “AB3 pool of activated B cell” population (compartment (Active B cells and Plasma

was governed by the same equation as for the first revaccination. 
The production rate of LLPC is βLL3 and this production rate to LLPCs (βLL) was estimated to be different

Model development followed the steps outlined in flowchart above.  
Initially only the primary vaccination data, i.e. levels after the first two doses were used.  
The developed model for two doses was then extended to the booster assuming the revaccination 
response mechanism to be similar. So, in the second step, the parameters from the primary vaccination 
model were fixed and only the parameters relevant to booster dose were estimated. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The model structure was adapted from Rhodes et al. There, the modelling framework was used to 
translate multi-dose tuberculosis vaccine immune responses from mice to predict most immunogenic 
Type II variation assessment report

dose in humans. Only few pooled Phase I data in adult human (N=10 and N=8) were available for 
model validation.  
Here, several parameters have been fixed based on different literature (Rhodes et al and Chen et al) 
and also based on sensitivity analyses that were not shown or provided for assessment, whether fixing 
to these values can be supported. In addition, some parameters that were fixed or estimated are not 
identical or in the range with corresponding values from literature. Parameter “death rate of short lived 
plasma cells” was estimated to 0.0653, the corresponding value from Chen et al. is 0.2310 and 0.2518 
for activated B cells. Activation rate of memory B cells was estimated to 0.087 day-1, the 
corresponding value in Chen et al. is 3. Some other fixed parameters differ only slightly, Memory B cell 
replication time (days) of 5 could not be found in the list of parameters from Chen et al. and was set 
ad on internal data not (again not shown). Information on initial conditions is missing. Assumptions are 
overall poorly justified. 
Taken together, parameter that are used in the modelling framework are indicated to be not plausible 
and not identifiable from the data. Predictability in particular outside the observation (that would be the 
case for prediction of nAB following a booster of different doses in the adolescent subgroup) is not 
deemed credible given the context of use. 
Initially only the primary vaccination data, i.e. levels after the first two doses were used to estimate 
the non-fixed parameters. The developed model for two doses was then extended to the booster 
assuming the re-vaccination response mechanism to be similar. The parameter from the primary 
vaccination model were fixed and only the parameters relevant to booster dose were estimated. 
Although, no supporting data for the assumption of similarity has been provided, the two-step process 
for parameter estimation is in general endorsed. 
The elimination rate for antibody (kel) was also fixed to a value in the range of that found in literature 
(Chen et al, A Mechanistic, Multiscale Mathematical Model of Immunogenicity for Therapeutic Proteins: 
Part 1). Elimination of mabs is however indicated to be dependent on weight. Weight was stated to be 
intended to be investigated during covariate selection, however, no information in this regard has been 
provided in the modelling and simulation report. In addition, the included AGE effect was only tested 
and introduced on a scaling factor V (volume), but one is not informed about the meaning/function of V 
in the mechanistic modelling framework. In particular, AGE does not reflect any degree of maturation 
that should be included in the model, as data from age group 6 month to two years of age were used 
for model building. See section Covariates in this regard. 
It was stated in the modelling report that different drug effect (effect of mRNA dose on δ) relationships 
have been tested (linear, Emax) by the MAH, and it was concluded that the dose-response relationship 
was best described by a linear model. However, no supporting documents could be found. Dose 
response is informed by two different doses tested in each age group, however this (potentially linear) 
relationship is expected to be different per age groups. 
The MAH is asked to justify the assumption that a linear function would be appropriate to characterise 
the drug effect (OC)  
The observed antibody titer was assumed to be produced by SLPC and LLPC at rate 
, a value 
derived from our previous in-house work by the MAH. No further information on the derivation of this 
𝑘𝑘𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘𝑅𝑅
parameter was provided with regards to this parameter. The MAH is asked to provide further 
information on the selection of kMAB, that seems to be a sensitive parameter for both, primary and 
booster response (OC).

the secretion rate by multiplying it with a scalar 0.45 * 
. Again, no further data to support the 
setting of this scaling factor to 0.45 could be found in the modelling report and should be provided. Of 
𝑘𝑘𝑅𝑅𝑘𝑘𝑅𝑅
note, this parameter is reflected with 0.44 in the table listing the final parameter estimates. (OC) 
Covariate selection 
Inter-individual variability was estimated for the scaling factor, representing volume, only. Covariates 
evaluated included age, bodyweight and revaccination time. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, body 
weight) were available in clinical studies that were added to the analysis dataset. Two covariates were 
assessed on the scaling factor, Volume of the IS/ID model, namely age of the subject and the dose 
received. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Inter-individual variability was estimated for the scaling factor, representing volume, only. Volume was 
estimated to 1.21e11 without statement of any unit and statement of plausibility. In the Methods part, 
it was stated that potentially relevant covariates evaluated included age, bodyweight and revaccination 
time, these demographic characteristics (age, sex, body weight) were available in clinical studies. 
However, only two covariates were assessed on the scaling factor, Volume of the IS/ID model, namely 
Age of the subject and the Dose received, which is not supported. Moreover, it was informed that dose 
played an important factor in the non-linear production of activated B cells and in a non-linear dose-
dependent production of memory-B cells, however seems not to be tested whether a covariate on 
these parameters would have been of statistical relevance. Other parameters such as kel (elimination 
of the antibody) or potentially relevant covariates including weight, and maturation (nAB data collected 
from very young subjects aged from 6 month to 2 years of age) have not been addressed. The 
covariate selection process could not be followed given the details in the Modelling report. It seems 
that it was not following a definite method, rather than just opposing the decrease in the objective 
function value by adding AGE and AGE+DOSE effects on V. No significance criterion was provided that 
would justify the selection of these covariates, that in addition seem to be correlated (Figure 4-3). In 
addition, no formula could be find that reflects how AGE and DOSE were implemented as covariate on 
V, and how V is connected to the modelled mechanistic dynamic. The proper integration of AGE and 
WEIGHT effects in this regard is however deemed pivotal, given the age range of subjects included in 
the population analysis. To circumvent these issues and to render the modelling more predictive – in 
particular concerning transferability to adolescents – exclusion of data from young children <2 years of 
age from model building is recommended. Overall, the details in terms of pre-specified analysis 
planned and documentation of modelling exercises are deemed incomplete, and not fully in line with 
the guideline on pop PK analysis.  
The MAH is asked to discuss the role of volume V in the modelling framework, including this would 
represent a physiological systems variable or just needed to describe the data. In this regard, a re-
discussion of covariate selection is to be provided by the MAH taking other potentially clinically relevant 
covariates such as weight into account. V as the single parameter for testing covariate effects should 
be further justified. As long as no maturation is included in the model, and AGE and weight effects are 
not clearly reflected, the inclusion of data from very young subjects for model building is not supported 
(OC).

Standard goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots were generated including: 
• Observed concentrations versus population predictions 
• Observed concentrations versus individual predictions 
• Individual subject fits 
• Visual predictive checks 
For the final combined post-booster model, a basic goodness of fit plots is shown below 
Adolescent individual fits for nAB titer following mRNA-1273 administration are shown in Figure 4-5

Figure 4-8 on the other hand shows the individual fits from representative post-booster dose fits. 
The predictive performance of the final models was assessed using visual predictive checks (VPC) and by 
comparing the mean GMT nAB titer of the model grouped by age and dose group compared to the

observed mean GMT in these groups. In addition, the % difference between the observed and predicted 
was computed (see table below). 
Individual random effects were plotted versus covariates such as study, age, dose. Individual random 
effects versus covariates included in the final model were compared in the base and final models to 
assess whether trends have been removed through the addition of covariate effects and whether any 
residual trends remain. Correlation plot matrices of individual random effects were explored to assess 
possible correlations between parameters. Individual fitted plots overlaid on observed data were 
examined for the final model to see if the model was able to capture the trends in the observed data on 
an individual level and to identify any unexplained or potentially erroneous data. 
Covariate of age or dose related to the empirical Bayes estimates are depicted below.

Assessor’s comment 
Observed vs predicted plots indicate a large variability in the data and a certain degree of shrinkage. In 
addition, there appear to be some subpopulations where nAB levels have the trend to be under-
estimated and deviate from the line of identity. These might be AGE or Dose-groups, or trends driven 
other effects not reflected in the model. 
Adolescent individual fits for nAB titer following mRNA-1273 administration (Study P203) and from 
representative post-booster dose fits (mean or median) indicate an overall acceptable description of 
data, however without a measure of variability with regards to the observation and prediction. 
The VPC plot indicate the model does not fully capture the variability in the data with respect to all 
measured time points (pooled Phase 2 and 3 data), with a certain percentage of observation with value 
1 on log scale. A trend in over-estimation of observation post day 150 is indicated. 
Thus, the MAH is asked to provide VPC plots stratified by age groups, study, and dose. (OC) 
In the Modelling Report it was stated that individual random effects were plotted versus covariates 
such as study, age, dose. This was only shown for age groups and doses. Individual random effects 
versus covariates included in the final model were compared in the base and final models to assess 
whether trends have been removed through the addition of covariate effects and whether any residual 
trends remain.  
Correlation plot matrices of individual random effects were stated to be explored to assess possible 
correlations between parameters. No correlation matrices were found and should be provided. It is 
indicated (Fig 4-3) that dose and age groups indeed are correlated. (OC) 
Comparison (Table 4-4): 
The % difference between the observed and predicted geometric mean titer (Day57) was computed per 
dose and age groups per study. Observed and predicted GMT were characterised by the respective 
95% confidence interval. The percentage difference was greatest (31%) for the response following 100 
µg dose in study 204 (age group 6-12 years of age), for the adolescent subpopulation in study 203 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 24/95 
 
 
 
 
 
(100 µg dose) the % difference was calculated to 23.6%. Of note, 95% CI are completely disjunct. 
Predicted GMT exceeds the observed GMT for most presented scenarios, including all adult and 
adolescent subgroups but young adults (18-25 years of age). 
Overall, from model evaluation and diagnostic plots some issues were identified concerning the 
predictive performance of the final model for primary and booster vaccination response. 
Results 
Data used for analysis and subject characteristics 
The distribution of subjects used in this IS/ID analysis and observed log PSVN50 versus time by AGE and 
DOSE are shown below. 
Exploratory Data Analysis

Except study P201 and P301 that represent the > 18-year age group, all other studies and age groups 
had only one time point collected per subject (as per protocol).  
In the > 18-year-old subjects, the nAB titer increases with time and the values collected at Day 57 on an 
average match the Day 57 titers observed with lower doses in other age groups.  
GMTs in the T4 group indicate levels after a booster dose collected from 201 Part B. The booster dose in 
this arm was given anywhere between 180 days to 275 days after the second vaccine dose. 
Final IS/ID Model and population IS/ID Analysis 
The IS/ID model was used to evaluate a 50 μg booster for the adolescent after a 100 μg prime dose. The 
schematic of the final population IS/ID model structure and parameter definitions and estimates are 
shown below:

For the pre-booster dose, δ3 , the booster dose component was not active. The final booster model was 
selected a two consecutive steps: 
First step: Analysing Pooled Pre-Booster P301, P201, P204 and P203 data 
The structure of the model developed established earlier was used to estimate model parameters. In 
addition to some system related parameters being fixed, a sensitivity analysis was performed to 
empirically stabilise a few parameters. At this stage of the analysis, using only data from primary 
vaccination series, i.e., 2 doses, three models were evaluated, 
1. Base model 
2. Age as a covariate on scaling factor, volume (V) 
3. Dose and age as a covariate on the scaling factor, volume (V) 
with results shown below: 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 27/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shrinkage on inter-individual variability random effects (η -shrinkage) was estimated to up to 26 % 
(Table 4-2). 
Assessor’s comment:  
As indicates above, covariate selection does not seem to follow a pre-specified analysis plan. Sensitivity 
analyses that lead to parameter fixing were not provided. The need for inclusion of Dose effect in 
addition to AGE-effect on V has not been justified based on any statistical pre-specified criterion.  
The decrease in objective function value by introducing additional degrees of freedom is expected. 
Second Step: Analysing Post-Booster P201-Part B data 
The booster data from P201-partB was then added to the analysis dataset and the third dose, 
3 was 
activated to fit the data. The system parameters were fixed to those used or estimated in the pre-booster 
𝛿𝛿
model. 
The full parameter table for the final population IS/ID model for pre- and post-booster analysis fits is 
presented in Table 4-3. The bootstrap medians were close to the final estimates for both models, and 
were relatively well centred within the bootstrap 95% CI, except for the transition rate to memory cells 
(day-1) and number of memory B cells that are generated per each 1 µg dose of mRNA-1273 (cells/µg).

Page 28/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessor’s comment 
In total, 6 of the system parameters were fixed to literature values, 7 were fixed based on sensitivity 
analyses (not shown for assessment). From the remaining parameters, 6 were again estimated based 
on data only, where the additive error, IIV on V, Age and Dose factor on V and the number of memory 
B cells that are generated per each 1 µg dose of mRNA1273 (cells/µg) remained at comparative size. 
For the latter, the 95% CI was found to be smaller for the combined pre- and post-booster estimate. 
Transition rate to long-lived plasma cells after 3rd vaccination was found to be about twice the one for 
the second vaccination, however estimated with a wide 95% confidence interval (0.0017, 0.0130). It is 
unclear how sensitive the nAB dymics would react with changes in fixed and estimated parameters, 
especially in those with balanced 95% CI (tvSLOPE, tvβAB).  
Further comments on chose parameters could be found in the Assessor’s comment on the model 
structure. 
Adolescent booster dose predictions 
The final IS/ID model with the booster dose included was used to simulated nAB titers on 28 days after a 
booster dose that was given 6 months after the second dose (100 μg primary vaccine dose).  
Specifically, the empirical Bayes estimates from the IS/ID model fits were used to simulate booster 
dosing in study P203 adolescent subjects (N=379). The ratio of the 28-day post-booster nAB GMT to the 
pre-booster nAB GMT was taken to compute a geometric mean fold ratio (GMFR) and the confidence 
interval around that estimate. The model predicted GMFR and its confidence interval were compared to 
the observed GMFR and confidence interval from the 18-25 year or the 18-55 year age group. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 29/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the actual P201 Part B study, the timing of booster ranged from 180-275 days (6-9 months) after the 
second dose. The observed GMFR is reflective of this distribution. 
In the adolescent predictions, all subjects received the 50 μg booster exactly 6 months after the second 
primary dose, i.e., at day 208 and the 28-day post booster was at day 236. As a result of the two points 
above, it is expected that the mean predicted GMFR is lower than the observed across the age groups. 
There were only N=7 subjects in 18–25-year age group in 201 Part B and hence the wide observed GMFR 
and confidence interval. 
The model predicted CI for the GMFR for the 12–18-year subjects (9.04 (8.57, 9.53)) lays within the 
range of the observed CI’s for the other age groups, i.e., 16.32 (4.53, 58.81) in 18-25-year (N=7) and 
11.88 (9.38, 15.06) in the 18-55-year subjects (N=68). 
Assessor’s comment: 
The model predicted GMFR in adolescents following a 50 µg booster dose 6 month after the second 
dose, and its confidence interval were compared to the observed GMFR and confidence interval from 
the 18-25 year or the 18-55 year age group. Comparison is however hampered due to the imprecise 
timing of the booster dose in age group 18-55 years of age (booster: 6-9 months) and very few 
subjects (N=7) available in age group 18-25 years of age.  
In order to improve the comparability between age groups and to meet the claimed EOI, the MAH is 
asked to simulate the following scenarios: 
- Adolescents receiving 50 µg booster dose 3 months and 9 months after second dose 
- Adolescents receiving 25 µg booster dose 3, 6 and 9 months after second dose 
- Adult age groups (18-25 and 18-65) receiving 50 µg booster dose 3, 6 and 9 months after second 
dose. 
GMT (+ 95% CI) should be provided post second dose, pre-booster and post-booster and GMFR (+95% 
CI) should be calculated and compared. (OC)

Discussion and conclusion 
The model structure was adapted from Rhodes et al. There, the modelling framework was used to 
translate multi-dose tuberculosis vaccine immune responses from mice to predict most immunogenic dose 
in humans. Only few pooled Phase I data in adult human (N=10 and N=8) were available for model 
validation.  
Here, several parameters have been fix based on different literature (Rhodes et al and Chen et al) and 
also based on sensitivity analyses that were not shown or provided for assessment or following the 
request for supplementary information. In addition, some parameters that were fixed or estimated are 
not identical or in the range with corresponding values from literature. Overall, parameter that are used 
in the modelling framework are indicated to be not plausible and not identifiable from the data. This is not 
acceptable in the context of use.  
The MAH requests an amendment to extend the use of a 50 μg booster dose of Spikevax to adolescents 
(12 to < 18 years) at a dosing interval of at least 3 months after completion of the primary series to 
prevent COVID-19. Modelling exercises have been conducted to support the submission being based on 
the extrapolation of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from young adults (18 to 25 years of age).  
The IS/ID analysis included a total of 2781 subjects pooled across P201 Part B, P203, P204 and P301 
clinical studies, of which 63.5 (%) received the 100 μg dose [age groups: 6-12, 12-18 and >18 years of 
age], 30.92(%) received the 50 μg dose [age groups: 6-12 and 2-6] and 5.57 (%) received the 25 μg 
dose [age groups:2-6 and 6months – 2 years of age]. Log10 transformed nAB titers (LogPSVN50) data 
was obtained from clinical studies P201, P301, P203, P204. Clinical and nAB data from young adults 
however was sparse. Only N=7 subjects in 18–25-year age group in 201 Part B leading to observed GMFR 
with wide confidence interval. To improve the comparability in nAB response between adolescent and 
adult subpopulations, respective simulations were asked and have been provided. Requested simulations 
showed that indeed, no distinct selection of dose and timing of the booster dose could be made while 
comparing adolescents with adult subpopulations. Given that no regulatory decision is based on modelling 
and simulation, this is acceptable. 
There remains uncertainty concerning the predictive performance of the pop IS/ID model. Several 
concerns could be identified with respect to the model structure/parameters used and covariate selection 
and analysis, assumptions were poorly justified, and reporting was not in line with the current guidance 
for pop PK modelling. Although data from very young children were used for model building, no 
maturation effect has been included in the model, and AGE and weight effects are not clearly reflected. 
Model evaluation indicates that the model serves for description of the data only. Justification for 
assuming a linear function to appropriately characterise the drug effect is still considered poor and there 
were inconsistencies with statements made in the IS/ID modelling report It was admitted that no further 
functions were tested and this will be addressed in updated version of the model. Justification of the 
timing and setting the dose strength of a booster dose for adolescents is however not acceptable based 
on modelling exercises (medium to high impact), given that no confirmatory efficacy data/nAB data in 
adolescents from clinical studies following booster vaccination are available.  
In total, the modelling and simulation approach for informing paediatric vaccination is acknowledged. 
Modelling exercises provided and data used for exploratory analyses indicate that the expected nAB 
response following a 50 µg booster vaccination would be at least in the range of that observed in the 
adult population. Model-based conclusion and simulation are in support, however should be considered 
with caution regarding definite decision on timing and dose strength of a booster vaccination in 
adolescents in the context of this variation procedure.

4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.1.  Safety Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety profile of Spikevax has been characterised within the previously approved indication extension 
from adults to adolescents 12-<18 years of age (EMA Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021). 
The safety database for the indication extension included data from the 08 May 2021 data snapshot. As of 
this cut-off date 2,486 adolescent received at least one dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine and 2,480 received 2 
doses. The median follow-up duration post dose 2 was 53 days for mRNA-1273 recipients. Within this 
procedure, the reactogenicity of Spikevax in adolescent has been compared to young adults 18-25 years 
of age. In this submission, the safety database for the use of Spikevax in adolescent is extended by 
global post-authorisation data from over 7.4 million adolescents completing the full 2-dose regimen. 
The present claim for approval of a booster dose of 50 µg of Spikevax in adolescents 12-<17 years of age 
given at least 3 months after completion of the primary vaccination schedule (2nd dose of Spikevax) is 
based on extrapolation of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data from young adults (18 to 25 years of 
age) to adolescents (12-<18 years of age). 
The following studies are the base to support the extrapolation of the safety of Spikevax when given as 
booster of 50 µg to adolescent.  
Initial marketing authorisation and indication for adults: 
P301: Ongoing pivotal randomised, initially observer-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in more 
than 30,000 participants, that supported the indication of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna in adults ≥ 18 
years of age (EMA Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/005791/0000) 
Booster and heterologous booster after full primary vaccination: 
P201: Part B of trial P201 is an open-label part assessing immunogenicity responses following 
administration of a 50 μg booster of mRNA-1273 to participants primed with 2 doses of mRNA-1273 in 
P201 Part A (50 μg or 100 μg of mRNA-1273). The interval between the prime series in Part A and the 
booster ranged from 5.8-8.8 months, with a mean of approximately 7.1 months. This study has been 
assessed within EMA procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0034 to support the approval of a 50 µg booster 
dose of Spikevax in adults. 
Within EMA procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0042 a heterologous booster of 50 µg of Spikevax was 
approved in adults. The approval was based on the NIH DMID 21-0012 study. The interval between 
primary series and booster injection was shorter in the DMID trial compared to the P201 trial with 
approximately 12-20 weeks after full primary vaccination. Based on this study and on the Com-COV2, 
and the COV-BOOST studies, the booster interval was shortened to 3 months after primary vaccination. 
Indication extension to adolescent: 
P203: Ongoing, two-part (Part A and Part B), Phase 2/3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled 
study that evaluates the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in healthy adolescents aged 12 - 
< 18 years. This study was evaluated in EMA procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021 to approve the 
licensure for adolescent 12-<18 years of age. 
The present submission to support the use of Spikevax for a booster dose in adolescent is completed by 
global post-authorisation data from an estimated number of over 20 million booster doses (either 50 µg 
or 100 µg) administered to 18- to 25-year-old young adults. A 3rd 100 µg dose 28 days post dose 2 is 
licensed and recommended for severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years of age and older (100 
micrograms) and children 6 - 11 years (50 micrograms).

4.2.  Safety Results 
Analysis of Solicited Adverse Reactions in Participants 12 to < 18 Years of 
Age Compared With 18 to 25 Years of Age 
Within procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021 that led to approval of the extension of indication for 
primary immunisation to adolescent, the reactogenicity of 2 doses of 100 µg of Spikevax has already 
been compared to adults 18-25 years of age. Solicited ARs from 12- to < 18-year-old participants in the 
mRNA-1273 group (100 μg) of Study P203 were compared with solicited ARs reported from 18- to 25-
year-old participants in the mRNA-1273 group (100 μg) in Part A of Study P301. The 08 May 2021 data 
snapshot relevant for the approval included a median study follow-up duration of 53 days (approximately 
2 months) after dose 2. As of 08 May 2021 (data snapshot date), 2,486 of 2,489 randomised adolescent 
participants (99.9%) in the mRNA-1273 group and 1,240 of 1,243 randomised participants (99.8%) in 
the placebo group had received dose 1. 2,480 (99.6%) and 1,222 (98.3%) in the two groups had 
received dose 2, respectively (information is taken from the AR for procedure II/021). 
The main reactogenicity results were summarised within the clinical overview of the present submission 
and are shown below.  
Table 1 and Table 2 present local and systemic solicited ARs by dose and severity, respectively. 
Table 1: Frequency of Solicited Local Adverse Reactions Within 7 Days After First and Second Injection

In both age groups the reactogenicity was higher post dose 2 compared with post dose 1. The 
comparison of local and systemic reactogenicity indicates that the overall incidence of solicited local ARs 
including grade 3 ARs is slightly higher in the age cohort 12 to <18 years compared with the age cohort 
18 to 25 years of age. The highest difference in local reactogenicity has been observed for injection site 
erythema and swelling, almost no difference for injection site pain. No meaningful difference could be 
observed for solicited systemic ARs including grade 3 ARs. The incidence of systemic solicited ARs tended 
to be comparable or slightly higher in young adults 18 to 25 years of age compared with adolescent 12 to 
<18 years of age. The incidence of severe (grade 3) systemic ARs in adolescent is lower post dose 2, 
compared to young adults (13.7 versus 21.6). The reactogenicity post dose 2 is higher in both age 
groups. The persistence of solicited ARs is comparable between the two age groups. Results must be 
interpreted with caution since the sample size in the age cohort 12 to <18 years was 3 fold higher than in 
the age cohort 18 to 25 years of age and it is a historical control group. Overall, no clinically meaningful 
difference in safety and reactogenicity could be observed in adolescents compared to young adults.

Analysis of Unsolicited Adverse Events in Participants 12 to < 18 Years of Age 
Compared With 18 to 25 Years of Age 
As previously demonstrated in EMA Procedure Number EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021, a comparison of 
unsolicited AE revealed similar results in adolescents and young adults. The incidence of unsolicited AEs 
was similar between age groups, with rates of 21% in adolescents and 26% in young adults within 28 
days after any injection. Most events were considered to be not vaccine-related and not severe. Within 28 
days after vaccination, there were 2 SAEs occurring in the adolescent group (< 0.1%) and no SAEs were 
reported in young adults. At the time of data snapshot, SAEs were reported by 0.2% of adolescent 
subjects in the MRNA-1273 vaccine group (6 subjects). SAEs in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group beside the 
2 events that occurred through day 28 (drug-induced liver injury and appendicitis together with 
diarrhoea, vomiting, and post-procedural fever) were pectus excavatum, suicidal ideation (2 subjects), 
and depression suicidal (1 subject). None of the SAEs was considered vaccine related. No cases of MIS-C 
were reported in adolescents, but the sample number is insufficient to detect this or other rare or very 
rare events. Results are summarised in Table 3. 
Table 3: Summary of Unsolicited Adverse Events in Participants 12 to < 18 Years of Age 
Compared With 18 to 25 Years of Age 
As stated in the clinical overview there were no SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study 
vaccine, no deaths, and no cases of MIS-C reported during the entire study period of trial P203. As of 01 
Feb 2022 in the live database of the ongoing trial P203 (Open-label Phase now), there were 31 SAEs 
reported, and none were assessed as related to the study vaccine. There were no deaths and no cases of 
MIS-C reported. 
Assessor´s comment:  
Based on the safety data submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021 to approve the 
indication extension to adults, the following has been concluded: 
A comparison with reactogenicity data from study P301 indicated a slightly higher local reactogenicity for 
all solicited local ARs except for pain in the age cohort 12 to <18 years compared with the age cohort 18 
to 25 years of age. No clinical meaningful difference could be observed for solicited systemic ARs. The 
incidence tended to be comparable or slightly higher in the age cohort 18 to 25 years of age compared 
with the age cohort 12 to <18 years of age. A comparison between adolescents and young adults 
suggests that the incidence of severe (grade 3) systemic ARs is somewhat lower for adolescents (4.4% 
dose 1, 13.7% dose 2), compared to young adults (5.2% dose 1, 21.6% dose 2). Results must be 
interpreted with caution since the sample size in the age cohort 12 to <18 years was 3 fold higher than in 
the age cohort 18 to 25 years of age and it is a historical control group.

A high level overview of the ongoing trial P203 has been provided in the clinical overview. This includes 
information, that no SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccine, no deaths, and no 
cases of MIS-C were reported during the entire study period. As of 1st February 2022, there were 31 SAEs 
reported in the live database of this ongoing study. This trial is now ongoing in an open-label design. 
Reference to corresponding listings are included in the overview, but were not submitted. As the scope of 
this submission is the approval of a booster dose of Spikevax for adolescent based on the extrapolation of 
reactogenicity to young adults, the update listings and safety data for trial P203 were not subsequently 
requested or assessed. The assessment of the ongoing trial P203 is not the scope of this submission. 
Due to the comparable reactogenicity profile observed for adolescents and young adults 18-25 years of 
age after mRNA-1273 primary vaccination and taking into consideration results from the ongoing safety 
monitoring in study P203 extrapolation of reactogenicity profile after the booster dose from young adults 
to adolescents maybe taken into consideration. However, the PDCO has recently concluded that the 
reactogenicity profile for the booster dose in adolescents shall be characterised as it could provide some 
insight into the general safety profile as well. Therefore, the MAH is requested to elaborate on existing 
data allowing for an estimation of reactogenicity after the third dose in adolescents. 
In addition to support the approval of a Spikevax booster dose in adolescents, the MAH submitted a 
clinical overview, the only document that has been submitted for the assessment of safety data. The 
clinical overview includes a high level summary of post authorisation pharmacovigilance data of the 
Safety Summary Report (SSR) #11. The SSRs are under PRAC surveillance. The assessment of the post-
approval safety data from the SSR #11 can be found in the following sections below.  
Post-Authorisation Safety Data 
Overall exposure and exposure by dose  
To further support the approval of the booster dose of Spikevax for adolescent, the MAH submitted a 
cumulative overview and high level analysis of post-authorisation safety data, extrapolating from the 
proportion of US vaccine recipients to the estimated global use. The reporting period for the booster 
dose/ 3rd dose is 18 Dec 2020 to 31 Dec 2021, as stated in the title of section 2.5.6.2.1.1 “Summary 
After a Third Dose or Booster Dose of SPIKEVAX Cumulative (18 Dec 2020 to 31 Dec 2021)”. The full 
Safety Summary Report has not been submitted but has been previously assessed by the PRAC (PRAC 
Assessment Report for the 11th summary safety update - Post-Opinion Measure 011.10). 
The collected safety data do not fully distinguish between individuals who received a third 100 μg dose, 
indicated for immunocompromised patients in some settings, and a 50 μg booster dose. Current data also 
do not distinguish the different dosing intervals that have been recommended for booster implementation 
in different countries. The recommended intervals range from 3 to 5 months, i.e. for example, France (3 
months), Germany (3 months), United Kingdom (3 months), Canada - Ontario (3 months), Switzerland (4 
months), and US (5 months). 
It should be noted, that the initially estimated exposure stated in the overview was inconsistent. A 
corresponding clarification was requested from the MAH. Within the response, the company clarified that 
in the Bi-Monthly Safety Summary Report # 1 (BSSR 1) it was stated, that the prior safety summary 
report (Data Lock Point: 31 December 2021) had a systematic error that overestimated the governmental 
donation doses by approximately 93 million doses. The error was clerical in nature: all estimated bilateral 
donations (124,091,211 doses) were included as administered rather than the stated assumption of 25% 
of estimated bilateral donation (31,022,803 doses). At the same time estimation of individuals receiving 
each dose number was also over estimated.

Page 38/95 
 
 
 
 
 
To estimate global use, the MAH extrapolates from the proportion of US vaccine recipients. In the 
response, the MAH estimates that as of 31 December 2021 a total of 827,274,740 doses have been 
distributed and 466,804,529 doses have been administered. 
As stated in the response, the correct number of estimated global use of Spikevax as of 31st Dec 2021 
was 216,113,851 individuals receiving a first dose, 176,800,748 receiving a second dose, and 73,889,930 
receiving a third dose. 
The MAH stated that the review of revised observed to expected analyses for the affected data did not 
materially change interpretation of safety assessment for any topic evaluated. 
Exposure per dose and age  
The exposure by age and dose as initially submitted by the MAH is shown in Table 4 below. In this table 
the 3rd dose exposure for young adults 18 to 24 years of age (8,128,797 estimated 3rd doses) is 
approximately 3 times higher than for adolescent (2,574,119 estimated 3rd doses). The 3rd dose exposure 
of approximately 3 million doses appeared unexpectedly high considering that Spikevax is not licensed in 
the US for individuals below 18 years of age for primary vaccination, and in the EU not yet for booster 
vaccination. The MAH was therefore asked to confirm the 3rd dose exposure of adolescents. The MAH 
response with regards to 3rd dose exposure revealed that the exposure number is rather based on 
assumptions than on reported information. Of note, this is due to the reporting system and the sources 
used by the company to estimate dose distribution and administration. Supply chain estimates are used 
to define the number of SPIKEVAX doses distributed by country, administration data are tracked by 
health officials within countries receiving the vaccine. Knowledge of demographics for administration data 
is limited to the information tracked and published by health officials within countries receiving the 
vaccine. Not all health authorities provide the same age strata when sharing this information, and none 
provide demographic data that are specific by brand and dose number. In fact, the previously reported 
3rd dose exposure of 3 million doses is far too high, and has been corrected to 120,000 3rd doses 
administered to individuals below 18 years of age. It should be noted, that this exposure estimation is not 
restricted to adolescents but includes also individuals below 12 years of age). 
It should be noted, that the total numbers of administered doses 1 (216,113,851), 2 (176,800,748), and 
3 (73,889,930) in the top line of the table summarise the doses administered to the overall population. 
The table shows, that 2.8% of all 3rd doses were administered to adolescent and 9.0% to young adults. 
Adding the doses for each age group, the total exposure by dose for individuals up to 24 years of age 
would be the follows. 
For dose 1: 25, 933, 663 for dose 2: 21,215,811 and for dose 3: 10,838,396. The total number of 3rd 
doses in the top line of table 3 (90,319,965) still appears to be inconsistent too what was stated in the 
text (73,889,930).

Assessor´s comment:  
The summary of distributed and administered doses overall, and by age has been inconsistently 
presented in the clinical overview. The MAH was asked to clarify. The presentation within the MAH’s 
response is still confusing. According to the MAH as of 31 December 2021 cumulative 827,274,740 doses 
have been distributed and 466,804,529 doses have been administered. As stated in the response, the 
correct number of estimated global use of Spikevax as of 31st Dec 2021 was 216,113,851 individuals 
receiving a first dose, 176,800,748 receiving a second dose, and 73,889,930 receiving a third dose. 
According to the submitted data, the exposure to dose 3 is 3 times higher in young adults 18-24 years of 
age (8,128,797 estimated 3rd doses) than in adolescent (2,574,119 estimated 3rd doses). 
Considering that Spikevax is not licensed in the US for individuals below 18 years of age for primary 
vaccination, and in the EU not yet for booster vaccination in children and adolescent, the claimed 3rd dose 
exposure of more than 3 million doses in adolescents appears unexpectedly high. It was not clear how 
the estimates for doses received and for the different age categories – in particular adolescents - were 
derived and further clarification was requested. The MAH’ response with regards to 3rd dose exposure 
revealed that the exposure number is rather based on assumptions than on reported information. Of 
note, this is due to the reporting system and the sources used by the company to estimate dose 
distribution and administration. Supply chain estimates are used to define the number of SPIKEVAX doses 
distributed by country, administration data are tracked by health officials within countries receiving the 
vaccine. Knowledge of demographics for administration data is limited to the information tracked and 
published by health officials within countries receiving the vaccine. Not all health authorities provide the 
same age strata when sharing this information, and none provide demographic data that are specific by 
brand and dose number. In fact, the previously reported 3rd dose exposure of 3 million doses is far too 
high, and has been corrected to 120,000 3rd doses administered to individuals below 18 years of age. It 
should be noted, that this exposure estimation is not restricted to adolescents but includes also 
individuals below 12 years of age. 
The MAH was requested to describe in detail the methodology and data sources (Countries/jurisdiction for 
use) that lead to the estimated exposure in the different age categories as well as estimates according to 
age and numbers of doses received.  
The MAH’s response contains uncertainties with regard to the methodology of spontaneous reporting for 
the assessment of age and dose related safety evaluations in mind the submitted data from spontaneous 
reporting to the MAH is not considered adequate to support the extrapolation approach.  
To support the extrapolation approach on a larger safety database the MAH is asked to submit: 
• 
Information on the proportion of adolescents 12-<18 years of age and young adults 18-25 years 
of age enrolled in ongoing PASSs. 
• 
A comprehensive comparison of the reactogenicity and safety profile of adolescents versus young 
adults based on the data available in the PASSs in the 2 populations 
• 
A comprehensive comparison of the reactogenicity and safety profile post dose 2 versus post dose 
3 in young adults based on available safety data from PASSs (OC).  
Summary of data after a Third Dose or Booster Dose of SPIKEVAX, 
Cumulative (18 Dec 2020 to 31 Dec 2021) 
Upon request the MAH confirmed, that by the time of the submission of the present indication extension 
there was no back log of event recording. The covered surveillance period for cumulative reporting is 18 
Dec 2020 to 31 Dec 2021.

With regard to a booster dose of 50 µg or a 3rd dose of 100 µg, cumulatively, the MAH has received 
17,511 cases with 52,354 events - of which 29,181 events were serious - for recipients after an 
estimated 88.6 million third dose or booster dose of Spikevax. Of these, 5,171 cases were medically 
confirmed, 8346 cases were serious, and 142 cases had fatal outcomes. The majority of cases were 
reported in females (11,673; 66.7%) compared to males (4,896; 28.0%) with the mean age of 52.8 
years (SD: 16.6; median: 53.0 years). Age and gender distribution of cases after a third dose is shown in 
Table 5. Table 5 indicates a low absolute number of reported cases in individuals below 18 years of age 
post dose 3.  
Table 5: Distribution of Cases After a Third Dose or Booster Dose of SPIKEVAX by Age Group and Gender 
Cumulative, source: clinical overview, Table 9 
Out of the 45 cases of children under 18 years of age that reported receiving a 3rd dose, 21 cases were 
reported as a medication error under the PT of “Product administered to patient of inappropriate age” and 
4 cases co-reported “Product administered to patient of inappropriate age” and “Inappropriate schedule of 
product administration”. The 17 cases reported in children <2 years of age were either pregnancy related 
or exposure through breast milk cases. Information about the remaining 3 cases with events different 
from Product administered to patient of inappropriate age” and “Inappropriate schedule of product 
administration” were submitted upon request from the assessor and included the following events. 
1.  A 12-15 years old subject with unknown medical history received a heterologous booster with 
Spikevax after full primary vaccination with Comirnaty. 2 doses of Comirnaty were administered  
within 22 days. The subject did not experience any ARs after primary vaccination. Approximately 
3 months later, the subject received a heterologous booster with one dose of Spikevax. A day 
after vaccination the subject experienced several severe ARs including muscle weakness, injection 
site pain, myalgia, fever, flu like symptoms asthenia, pain (described as body aches), flushing, 
and chills. Events were resolving on day 3 after vaccination. It can be agreed with the MAH, that 
the events are considered possible related and considered an expression of reactogenicity events 
currently labelled for Spikevax. 
2.  A 16-17 years old subject with unknown medical history experienced on the next day after the 
3rd dose with Spikevax several reactogenicity events including pyrexia, myalgia, and pain in 
extremity (described as sore arm, probable the vaccinated arm). Information on severity of 
events was not provided Patient was treated with ibuprofen and the next day events resolved. No 
other information was provided. Based on the description of the symptoms and the temporal 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 41/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relationship it can be agreed, that the events are possibly related and sign of expected 
reactogenicity labelled for Spikevax. 
3.  This case describes occurrence of myasthenia gravis crisis in a 16-17-year-old subject with 
medical history of COVID-19 and myasthenia gravis developed after COVID-19. The time point of 
COVID-19 and Spikevax with the 3 Spikevax doses is not provided. The subject had received a 3rd 
dose of Spikevax. The first two doses were given one month apart, the third dose was given 175 
days after the second dose. The provided report is however inconsistent with the dosing dates, 
but the mentioned periods in between doses are deemed the correct dates. Symptom onset for 
myasthenia gravis crisis was 1 week after vaccination, with inability to move, trouble talking, 
moving and swallowing over a couple of Weeks until it reached a peak which lasted for months. 
Since the third dose IVIGs side effects have also been really bad for multiple days afterwards 
which was not the case before. The subject is still not where they was before the additional dose 
of Spikevax. The subject did not report AEs after the 2 previous doses of Spikevax. The additional 
dose of Spikevax was considered as 3rd dose because of the subject being immunocompromised. 
Information on the administered dose (50 µg or 100 µg) is not provided. Recorded medication 
includes Mestinon, Prostigmin, Prednisone, Vit D, Omeprazole. 
The case number of 45 cases in individuals below 18 years of age was confirmed by the MAH within the 
responses to RSI, but is now as said above related to approximately 120,000 3rd dose administrations, 
the number after the re estimation of 3rd dose exposure that was performed by the MAH. 
Assessor´s comment:  
It appears that cumulative only few cases post dose 3 (i.e. either a 50 µg booster or a 100 µg 3rd dose in 
case of immunosuppressed condition) are recorded for adolescents. Table 9 confirms the low absolute 
number of cases in individuals below 18 years of age. Only for 42 of 45 reported cases information is 
available in the overview. The reported AEs were due to medication error under the PT of “Product 
administered to patient of inappropriate age” and “Inappropriate schedule of product administration”. The 
MAH was asked to submit information with regard to the nature and severity of the remaining cases and 
events in children below 18 years of age including a causality assessment. The clinical information for the 
remaining 3 cases has been submitted by the MAH as has been described above. Two of the cases 
represent expected reactogenicity events that are labelled for Spikevax. One of these 2 cases occurred 
after heterologous booster administration (Comirnaty primary vaccination without ARs, booster with 
Spikevax 3 month after primary vaccination). The third case describes a myasthenia gravis crisis in a 16-
17 year old subject with known myasthenia gravis that the subject acquired after COVID-19. The time 
frames of COVID-19 and the vaccination with 3 doses of Spikevax is not provided. A causal relationship 
cannot be excluded. 
Due to a clerical error (details are discussed below), the reported cases after dose 3 were unclear. The 
MAH was asked to clarify the case number after dose 3 in individuals below 18 years of age. The MAH 
submitted a corresponding table within the response document (Table 2, ITEM 2). The table confirmed 
the low case number.  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 42/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the sake of absolute clarity/certainty regarding this important aspect, the MAH is requested to 
confirm that the number of 45 cases in children and adolescent below 18 years of only refers to cases 
observed in the period from 18 December 2020 to 31 December 2021. In the MAH’s response the case 
number of 45 cases in individuals below 18 years of age was confirmed within the responses to RSI, but 
is now as said above related to approximately 120.000 3rd dose administrations, the number after the re-
estimation of 3rd dose exposure that was performed by the MAH. 
Events of Clinical Interest Based on MedDRA System Organ Class 
Cumulative, 52,354 events for recipients after a third dose or booster dose of Spikevax were reported of 
which 29,181 were serious from an estimated 88.6 million 3rd doses. The top 3 system organ classes, 
higher level terms, and PTs for all events for recipients after a third dose or booster dose of Spikevax in 
the cumulative reporting period are presented in Table 6.

Assessor´s comment:  
The tables showing Top 3 Serious AEs after a 3rd dose were not inserted in the overview. The entire SSR 
#11 has also not been submitted but the document is available from the corresponding PRAC procedure. 
Cumulative events, but not cumulative SAEs by SOC/HLT/PT after a 3rd or a booster dose can be found in 
the SSR 11. SAEs are provided only for 2 different reporting periods (01 Dec 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 and 01 
Nov 2021 to 30 Nov 2021). The top 3 events and top 3 SAEs are however the same by PT, i.e. headache, 
pyrexia and fatigue. All events are already known and documented AEs for Spikevax. 
Overview of Reported Cases for Adolescents (12 to 17 Years Old) regardless 
of dose number 
This AR paragraph relates to information given in section 2.5.6.2.1.4, which contains number of cases 
reported in adolescent regardless of the dose number. The headline section has a clerical mistake by 
stating, that reports were received after 3rdor booster dose. 
Cumulatively, the MAH has received 5808 cases (9981 events, of which 1081 events were serious) for 
adolescents (12 to 17 years old) from an estimated 3,087,330 third or booster dose. Of these, 4936 
cases were medically confirmed, 443 cases were serious, and 7 cases had fatal outcomes. 
Age and sex distribution of events, absolute case numbers of events after each dose, the time to onset 
(TTO), and the Top 10 preferred terms (PTs) are shown in Table 9 to10. The majority of cases were 
reported in females (54.3%, 3153) compared to males (41.6%, 2415) with the mean age of 15.9 years 
(SD: 1.5; median: 16.0 years). More cases were reported for females (3153) than for males (2415), and 
more cases in the older age range 16-17 years of age (4433), than in the younger age range 12-15 
(1375). The majority of the events reported for adolescents were after dose 1 (5791; 58%) and with a 
TTO of 0 to 2 days (5186; 52%). The 10 most commonly reported events for adolescent excluding 
product administered to patients of inappropriate age were events related to reactogenicity. The 
comparison between age groups and gender is limited, since only absolute numbers and not reporting 
rates/incidences are provided.

SAEs after any dose  
Upon request the MAH provided a table (Table 5 in response to ITEM 4, not presented in this AR) showing 
all SAEs by SOC and preferred term. In summary the vast majority of SAEs is related to expected and 
labelled symptoms of reactogenicity, e.g. pyrexia (21.4%), fatigue (6.8%), nausea (6.8%), vomiting 
(6.1%), and fatigue (6.8%), malaise (5.0%). However, 22.3% of SAEs were due to myocarditis and 4.5% 
due to pericarditis. Altogether 61 PTs (13.7%) were related to cardiac events other than myocarditis and 
pericarditis (e.g. arrhythmia, atrial tachycardia, bradycardia, cardiac flutter, palpitations, sinus 
tachycardia, tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, SVT, and VT). From the table it cannot be concluded if and to 
what extent the cardiac events are associated with cases of myo-or pericarditis. Other PTs with high 
proportion was dyspnoea (8.4%), chest pain and chest discomfort (15.1% together), syncope (10.6%), 
and loss of consciousness (5.2%). 
Not in the clinical overview, but available in SSR #11, the top 10 most frequently reported PTs in serious 
cases in adolescent with >2% reporting rate (after any dose) are shown and are tabled below in Table 
12. The TOP 3 SAEs for adolescent after any dose for the reporting period 01 Dec 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 
are myocarditis, pyrexia, and chest pain. Of the 9 cases of chest pain, five were in association with 
Myocarditis, and one case is in association with Pericarditis.

Assessor`s comment: 
The SAEs reported after any dose are more relevant for the assessment of the general safety of Spikevax 
including the primary vaccination, rather than the booster dose. The assessment of the primary 
vaccination is not scope of this procedure. The submitted data however cannot be ignored. Within the 
previous EMA procedures, extending the indication to adolescent and later to children below 12 years of 
age, causality of the events of cardiac rhythm disorders, chest pain, and dyspnoea could not finally be 
estimated, therefore reassessment with another data base assessment seems needed. The MAH is asked 
to reassess the events shown in Table 5, that was submitted within the response to ITEM 4 as follows: 
a.  to investigate potential causality of the SAEs of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiac events other 
than myo-or pericarditis, chest pain, and dyspnoea. From the table it cannot be concluded to what 
extent these cardiac events were associated with cases of myocarditis or pericarditis. This should also 
be clarified. Depending on the assessment, the events should be included in the SmPC specifically for 
the paediatric population. 
It should be noted, that this question has been removed during ETF discussion to transfer this issue to 
PRAC. 
Sections 2.5.6.2.1.1 and 2.5.6.2.1.4 of the overview appeared to be inconsistent or at least misleading 
with regard to recorded cases. In section 2.5.6.2.1.4 of the overview it is stated, that cumulatively, 
Moderna has received 5808 cases (9981 events, of which 1081 events were serious) for adolescents (12 
to 17 years old) from an estimated 3,087,330 third or booster dose. Of these, 4936 cases were 
medically confirmed, 443 cases were serious, and 7 cases had fatal outcomes. This appeared to be 
inconsistent with the numbers mentioned in section 2.5.6.2.1.1 stating that 45 cases in children under 18 
years of age who had received a 3rd dose were reported cumulative (18 Dec 2020 to 31 Dec 2021) after 
an estimated 88.6 million third dose or booster dose of Spikevax. The MAH was asked to clarify (ITEM 
2a.) Within the response the MAH clarified that the inconsistency is due to clerical mistake. In section 
2.5.6.2.1.4 the information provided referred to the number of cases that the MAH had received for 12 
to 17 years old cumulative as of 31st December 2021 (5808 cases (9981 events, of which 1081 events 
were serious)), regardless of dose number. The clerical mistake was adding in the section headline, 
that those reports were after a 3rd or booster dose. All the information provided in section 2.5.6.2.1.4 
pertains to the cumulative number of cases reported in adolescent regardless of the dose number. 
Clinical summary of fatal cases reported to have occurred after 3rd dose or 
booster dose 
After request the MAH submitted available information for the 7 fatal cases in adolescent that were 
reported in the overview as having occurred after 3rd or booster dose. The provided information revealed 
that the fatal cases occurred after dose 1 or dose 2, or after an unknown dose. The fatal cases are none 
the less summarised here for information. 
Case 1: 15 year old female, received dose 2 of Spikevax, 1 dosage form.  
Previous medical history: Relevant multimorbidity including amongst others bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 
renal dysplasia, sleep apnoea syndrome, asthma, hypothyroidism, atrioventricular septal defect, Trisomy 
21, drug hypersensitivity. The patient experienced Cardiac arrest. The patient died on the next day. The 
reported cause of death was Cardiac arrest. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. The paediatric 
intensive care unit (PICU) attending the patient believed the events started about 3-4 days after her 
second Moderna Vaccine. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 47/95 
 
 
 
 
 
Case 2: 13 year old male, received 1 dosage form of Spikevax, the dose number is not known, also 
unknown route. No medical history information was reported. The boy died on an unknown date. 
According to the MAH, he died one day after receiving the vaccine, while in the submitted case report it is 
stated that death occurred 3 days after vaccination. The cause of death was not reported. It is unknown if 
an autopsy was performed. The information is rather limited. Further information has been requested.  
Case 3: 15-year-old male. The patient's relevant underlying condition is cerebral arteriovenous 
malformation. The patient received the 1st dose of Spikevax. Approximately 9 hours later, the patient 
had a headache and vomiting and was taken to the hospital. The patients Japan Scale Coma was 300 on 
arrival, corresponding to a GCS score of 3 (the minimum score is a 3 which indicates deep coma or a 
brain-dead state). CT showed cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ventricular rupture from cerebral 
arteriovenous malformation. Four days after hospital admission, the patient was confirmed dead. The 
outcome of cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral ventricular rupture was reported as fatal.  
Case 4: 17 year old male. The patient received a dose of Spikevax via unknown route (1 dosage form). 
Concurrent medical conditions included Cardiomyopathy (Had risk in situations of stress.). On an 
unknown date, the patient experienced myocarditis (Bilateral Myocarditis) and died. The cause of death 
was not reported and the death date was unknown. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the 
time of death, myocarditis (Bilateral myocarditis) outcome was unknown. 
Case 5: 17 year old male, received the second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (unknown route) 1 dosage 
form. The patient was found dead in his bedroom and the case was reported by a non- health 
professional. Death occurred on 2021. The cause of death was not reported. It is unknown if an autopsy 
was performed. No relevant concomitant medications were reported. Treatment information was 
unknown. 
According to the company, the 17-year-old male subject has an unknown medical history. He experienced 
the serious unlisted adverse event of death a few days after receiving his second dose of mRNA-1273. 
The patient was found dead in his bedroom. No further information is currently available on the reason of 
his death or events that may have resulted in death. 
Case 6: A 13 year old male received a dose of Spikevax IM, 1 dosage form. 7 days later, the patient 
experienced Pyrexia (Fever) and the other day , on the next day, the patient experienced seizure and on 
the following day, headache. The reported cause of death was Fever, Seizure and Headache. It is 
unknown if an autopsy was performed. For mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not 
provide any causality assessments. No information on previous medical history is available.  
There is no information about the number of the vaccine dose the patient received and no information on 
the date of the death and if the patient died in hospital. No information on previous medical history or 
treatment and also related to the symptoms (i.e. the grade of the fever, if the seizures happened at a 
certain grade of the temperature) is available.  
Case 7: A 14 year old female received the 1st dose of Spikevax IM, 1 dosage form. Approximately 2 
weeks later the patient experienced Dizziness, Headache and Pyrexia. On the following day, the patient 
experienced Cardiac arrest, Brain injury, Brain herniation, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. On an 
unknown date, the patient experienced nausea. The patient died the day after. The cause of death was 
not reported. The interim cause of death certificate stated no gross morphologic cause of death. 
Neuropathology, histology, and virology toxicology results are pending. The girl fainted at school 2 
months prior to presentation but has nil significant past medical history. 
The onset of symptoms: the girl complained that she felt unwell and dizzy. CPR was performed and 
Patient was transported via ambulance to hospital where Patient was declared deceased. Treatment 
notes: 16 days post vaccination patient complained of headache and nausea; the following morning she

was found unconscious. RoSC achieved after two shocks; LMA inserted and transported to Hospital; loss 
of output en route however RoSC achieved after adrenaline and CPR; at hospital. Lab Data: lactate 20 
and pH <6.8; in resuscitation, patient had recurrent episodes of loss of cardiac output (non-shockable 
rhythm) followed by CPR and return of spontaneous circulation. CT brain was performed and showed 
changes in keeping with global ischemia. In ICU the girl sustained rapid development of multiorgan failure 
as well as hypoxic brain injury with tonsillar herniation; patient passed away on the morning after the 
onset of symptoms. 
Assessor´s comment:  
The clinical information for all cases are rather limited and results and further information is pending. 
Some of the deceased participants had underlying conditions that could be attributable for the outcome, 
but not all of them. The safety of Spikevax administered to adolescent is under monitoring by the PRAC.  
Event Reporting Rates by dose  
Upon request the MAH submitted reporting rates for any event, for SAEs, non-SAEs, and AESIs by dose, 
age, and sex. Results are presented in Table 13. The reporting rates for all of the events for adolescent 
and young adults are not higher post dose 3 compared to post dose 2. 
Assessor´s comment:  
The reporting rates do not raise concerns with regard to the administration of a booster dose and are 
considered qualified to support the extrapolation approach from young adults to adolescents. Reporting 
rates are critically dependent on the denominator which needs to be clarified (OC).

Analysis of Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
An observed versus expected analysis of myocarditis by dose was performed and described in the clinical 
overview. This analysis covered all age groups from below 12 years of age to more than 75 years of age. 
The analysis confirms what is currently known about the epidemiology of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 
associated myocarditis. The analysis shows that myocarditis rates appear to be lower following Dose 3 
compared with dose 2. This is more evident for the age groups up to 49 years of age than for the older 
age groups. For adolescents of note post dose 3 data are not available. The analysis indicates that the 
rates are higher in males compared with females, which is also in line with what is currently known about 
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine associated myocarditis and pericarditis. The highest rate, i.e. 8.41 (6.23, 11.36) 
is observed in males 18-24 years of age post dose 2. Results are shown in Table 14.

Adolescents (12 to 17 Years Old) Analysis of Myocarditis and Pericarditis – 
Cumulative to 31 Dec 2021 
Cumulatively, there were 116 cases (122 events) of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents 12 to 17 
years of age (3% of all cases reported), with 98 cases medically confirmed. There were 103 (88.8%) 
cases reported in males and 13 (11.2%) in females. The mean age of the adolescents was 15.7 years 
(SD: 1.3) and the median age was 16 years (minimum: 12/maximum: 17). The majority of the cases 
reported in adolescents were in males aged 16 to 17 years (69, 59.5%). 
Cumulatively, there were 101 events of myocarditis reported in adolescents (including 1 event of 
myocarditis infectious), with the greatest proportion of the events (45.5%) occurring after the second 
dose (46 events as shown in Table 16). Results for myocarditis and pericarditis together and for 
myocarditis alone by dose and TTO are summarised in Table 15 and Table 16 and 17. The majority of 
myocarditis cases occur within the first 4 days, i.e. 11/18 cases (61%) post dose 1 and 40/46 cases 
(87%) post dose 2.

The reporting rates for myocarditis within 7 days after dose 1, 2, and 3 again confirm the above-
mentioned findings. Reporting rates were highest post dose 2, and higher in males compared with

females. The highest rate was reported for males 18-24 years of age post dose 2 (40.26 [9,065,023]). 
There have been no fatal reports in adolescents due to myocarditis or pericarditis. No cases of 
myocarditis in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age after a third/booster dose of Spikevax have been 
reported. Reporting rates by dose age group and sex are shown in Table 17.

clinical overview 
Other AESI 
As of 31 Dec 2021, there were no reports of most AESIs in third-dose recipients 18 to 24 years of age. 
Small numbers of cases of convulsions, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmia, Bell’s Palsy, 
narcolepsy/hypersomnia, erythema multiforme, pancreatitis, and thyrotoxicosis were reported. None of 
these AESIs occurred at a reporting rate that exceeded the expected based on population-based studies 
estimating background incidence. For the AESIs of Myocarditis (with or without pericarditis), Pericarditis 
(with or without myocarditis), and pericarditis without myocarditis of note the observed rate after any 
dose was higher than the expected rate. The rate ratio was above 1 for Myocarditis (with or without 
pericarditis) and pericarditis without myocarditis, and above 2 for Pericarditis (with or without 
myocarditis). There was no AESI for which the observed to expected rate ratio was higher for dose 3 than 
for the overall Global Safety Database. Results are shown in Table 18.

A full description of the study methodology and applicable underlying event rates has been provided in 
Interim Report 4 of the US Post-Authorisation Safety Study (mRNA-1273-P903) submitted on 31 January 
2022. IR 4 of mRNA-1273-P903 has been assessed and discussed within PRAC procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/003.5. Due to patient privacy, the HealthVerity data is limited to reporting year 
of birth. Therefore, there is a potential to misclassify individuals who are 18 years of age at the time of 
vaccination in the paediatric cohort. This is in line with the fact that 63% of the paediatric cohort was 17 
years old, potentially reflecting the reporting limitation in HealthVerity. 
Spikevax is not authorised for use in <18-year-olds. Therefore, for a proportion of paediatric individuals 
Spikevax exposure could have been miscoded to authorised products. Alternatively, clinicians may have 
recommended off-label use due to an elevated risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health 
conditions. This would impact risk estimates if the underlying conditions are associated with the outcomes 
of interest. Moreover, this paediatric population is unlikely representative of the general US paediatric 
population. AESIs will continuously be followed by PRAC. The increased incidence rate ratios of AEs 
between vaccinated and unvaccinated <18-year-olds in this study are based on very few events, limiting 
the interpretation. A more robust observed/expected (O/E) analysis which considers relevant risk 
windows of the AESI is performed for any AESI with an IRR of ≥2 (if based on more than 5 events). This 
was done for Acute Kidney Injury where the O/E was not elevated for all <18-year-olds. It should 
however be noted, that it was elevated for <12-year-olds (based on 6 events). This potential signal will 
be evaluated via Self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis with the next interim report. PRAC does not 
see any immediate safety concern based on the data in <18-year-olds from this US PASS. 
Assessor´s comment:  
The Incidence RRs provided for many of the AESIS could raise concerns with regard to the extrapolation 
from adolescent to young adults as the IRRs appear to be elevated for the adolescent population, but not 
for the adult population. However, IRR estimation is considered as only an initial crude signal detection 
step and more robust O/E analysis should be performed for AESIS with an elevated IRR. Moreover, IRRs 
from age and sex standardised comparison of post vaccination and historical incidence of AESIs cannot be 
interpreted without information on the underlying methodology of this analysis and the event numbers of 
each AESI. The MAH was therefore asked to describe the methodology of the analysis and discuss the 
findings, particularly for the events with IRRs over 2. The answer clarified, that the AESIs are under 
monitoring of PRAC. PRAC does not see any immediate safety concern based on the data in <18-year-
olds from this US PASS. The CHMP and the PRAC Rapporteurs were in communication concerning the 
elevated AESI IRRs in the paediatric population in study mRNA-1273-P903.

4.3.  Discussion of safety 
With its submission the MAH requests to extend the use of a 50 μg booster dose of Spikevax to 
adolescents (12 to < 18 years) at a dosing interval of at least 3 months after completion of the primary 
series to prevent COVID-19. The submission is based on the extrapolation of safety data from young 
adults (18 to 25 years of age). Comparing data collected for the primary vaccination schedule, local 
reactogenicity seems to be slightly higher in adolescent (data from study P203) than in young adults 
(data from study P302) as already evaluated in the course of procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021. No 
clinical meaningful difference could be observed for solicited systemic ARs but it appears that the 
incidence of systemic solicited ARs tends to be comparable or slightly higher in young adults (18-25 years 
of age) compared with adolescents. Due to the comparable reactogenicity and safety profile observed for 
adolescents and young adults 18-25 years of age after mRNA-1273 primary vaccination and taking into 
consideration results from the ongoing safety monitoring in study P203 with Spikevax, extrapolation of 
reactogenicity profile after the booster dose from young adults to adolescents could in principle be 
considered.  
To further support the approval of a booster dose in adolescents the MAH submitted a summary of 
spontaneous post-authorisation AE reported to Moderna with a cut-off date 31 Dec 2021 (taken from SSR 
#11). Considering that Spikevax is not licensed in the US for individuals below 18 years of age for 
primary vaccination, and in the EU not yet for booster vaccination, the 3rd dose exposure of 
approximately 2,600,000 doses in individuals below 18 years of age seems high.  
Considering that Spikevax is not licensed in the US for individuals below 18 years of age for primary 
vaccination, and in the EU not yet for booster vaccination the estimated 3rd dose exposure of 
approximately 3 million doses appeared unexpectedly high and on the other hand the number of reported 
cases with AE in this age group very small (45). The MAH was therefore asked to discuss the numbers. In 
fact, the previously reported 3rd dose exposure of approximately 3 million doses is far too high, and has 
been re estimated to be 120,000 3rd doses administered to individuals below 18 years of age. It should 
be noted, that this exposure estimation is not restricted to adolescents but includes also individuals below 
12 years of age. The case number for AEs after dose 3 was confirmed by the MAH, but is now related to 
approximately 120.000 administered 3rd doses. The reported AEs post dose 3 for which information was 
provided in the clinical overview were due to medication error under the PT of “Product administered to 
patient of inappropriate age” and “Inappropriate schedule of product administration”. The MAH was asked 
to submit information for the 3 remaining cases and events in children below 18 years of age post dose 3. 
Two cases represent expected reactogenicity events that are labelled for Spikevax. One of the 2 cases 
occurred after heterologous booster administration (Comirnaty primary vaccination without ARs, booster 
with Spikevax 3 month after primary vaccination). The third case describes a myasthenia gravis crisis in a 
16-17 year old subject with known myasthenia gravis acquired after COVID-19. A causal relationship 
cannot be excluded. Upon request the MAH submitted reporting rates for any event, for SAEs, non-SAEs, 
and AESIs by dose, age, and sex. The reporting rates for all of the events for adolescent and young 
adults, including all events, SAEs, non-serious AEs, and AESIs are not higher post dose 3 compared to 
post dose 2. The reporting rates do not raise concerns with regard to the administration of a booster dose 
in adolescents and could support the extrapolation approach from young adults to this population. The 
observed versus expected analysis of myocarditis as well as the reporting rates per million doses of 
Spikevax administered in adolescents confirm, what is currently known about mRNA COVID-19 associated 
myocarditis, i.e. reporting rates are highest post dose 2, and higher in males compared with females. The 
highest rate of myocarditis was reported for males 18-24 years of age post dose 2. No cases of 
myocarditis in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age after a third/booster dose of Spikevax was reported to 
date. In young adults 18-24 years of age, no AESIs except for myocarditis and pericarditis after any dose 
occurred at a reporting rate that exceeded the expected population-based studies estimating background 
incidence. There was no AESI for which the observed to expected rate ratio was higher for dose 3 than for 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 56/95 
 
 
 
 
the overall Global Safety Database. The performed observed versus expected analysis as well as the 
reporting rates of myocarditis within 7 Days after Dose 1, 2, and 3 per million doses are in line with what 
is currently known for mRNA COVID-19 associated myocarditis. In adolescent, so far no cases of 
myocarditis post dose 3 have been recorded in the Moderna safety data bank. 
Therefore, the MAH was asked to provide an updated analyses of the myocarditis cases with an extended 
time frame of at least 30 days into account as the time frame of 7 days post dose was considered short. 
Regarding to this item the MAH has provided an extended time period of a 21-day risk window, with a 
more highly sensitive estimate of the reporting rate, including data for cases beyond the 30-day. The 
analysis has been updated based on the methods previously requested by PRAC, including cases per 100 
000 per person-year- cumulative to 15 April 2022. The higher reference rate has been used to support 
observed vs. expected analyses in Table 4 and the majority of adverse event reports (not only limited to 
myocarditis) in the adolescent population occur in individuals ages 16-17 years of age. If the lower 
estimate were to be selected, the observed vs. expected rate ratio would be comparable between 
adolescents and young adults (O/E in ages 12 – 17: 3.11, 95% CI 2.19 – 4.41). The rate O/E in the 
males of age group 12-17 was 24.32/17.33 in contrary with the rate in females with O/E 1.99/ 8.67.  
Within the previous EMA procedures for the extension of the primary vaccination indication to adolescent 
and later to children below 12 years of age, causality of the events of cardiac rhythm disorders, chest 
pain, and dyspnoea could not finally be estimated. These events appear as top 10 SAEs in the post 
approval safety surveillance and in a list summarising SAE preferred terms for adolescents after any dose. 
It is acknowledged, that the safety assessment for Spikevax after any dose, i.e. including primary 
vaccination is not scope of this procedure. However, the post approval data for these SAEs cannot be 
ignored.  
In summary, the extrapolation approach from young adults to adolescents to estimate the safety of a 
booster dose given to adolescents at least 3 months after full primary vaccination with Spikevax seems 
justified due to the comparable reactogenicity in these two age groups after primary vaccination with 
Spikevax. Clinical information stemming from a limited number of cases for administration of a booster 
dose in adolescents together with the post approval safety data after booster administration in young 
adults do currently not raise safety concerns with regard to a homologous booster dose for adolescents. 
The MAH however did not provide the requested comprehensive and comparative analysis (adolescents 
vs. young adults) and discussion of safety based on post-marketing data. This was requested to support 
the extrapolation approach. Before approval of the booster dose for adolescents can be granted, the MAH 
is requested to submit this analysis and discussion.  
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC are being updated to include a 50 µg booster 
dose for adolescents 12 to 18 years of age. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

7.  The MAH is asked to discuss the role of volume V in the modelling framework, including this 
would represent a physiological systems variable or just needed to describe the data. In this 
regard, a re-discussion of covariate selection is to be provided by the MAH taking other potentially 
clinically relevant covariates such as weight into account. V as the single parameter for testing 
covariate effects should be further justified. As long as no maturation is included in the model,

b)  - Adolescents receiving 25 µg booster dose 3, 6 and 9 months after second dose 
c)  - Adult age groups (18-25 and 18-65) receiving 50 µg booster dose 3, 6 and 9 months 
after second dose. 
GMT (+ 95% CI) should be provided post second dose, pre-booster and post-booster and GMFR

Safety 
10. Considering that Spikevax is not licensed in the US for individuals below 18 years of age for 
primary vaccination, and in the EU not yet for booster vaccination the following observations are 
made: 
- 
The estimated 3rd dose exposure of more 3 million doses appears unexpectedly high and 
should be confirmed and discussed.  
-  On the other hand the number of reported cases with AE in this age group is very small 
(45) and in contradiction to the estimated exposure. This number needs to be confirmed 
and discussed.

7.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
The MAH is asked to provide additional information on the status of study P203 Part C 
regarding timelines and availability of interim or final study reports. 
MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that mRNA-1273 is being studied in adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age in the US in 
Study mRNA 1273-P203, a Phase 2/3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo controlled study that 
evaluates the safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in healthy adolescents. 
The goal of the study was to support an indication for use of mRNA-1273 (100 μg IM, given as 2 doses, 
28 days apart) in the 12 to < 18 years of age group. The blinded placebo controlled portion of this study 
was submitted and approved under procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021. As per protocol upon FDA 
granting an EUA in the adolescent age group (for a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine other than mRNA-1273), 
subjects were unblinded and crossed over. 
Recently, protocol Amendment #3 was implemented to provide a 50 μg booster dose of mRNA-1273 to all 
participants. This change was prompted by the authorisation of a 50 ug booster dose for adults 18 years 
and older, supported by data from study P201B. The use of mRNA-1273 as a booster dose regimen in 
adolescents 12 - <18 years of age is currently investigated in clinical study P203 Part C. The booster 
portion of the clinical trial P203 Part C is on-going (first subject dosed late December 2021) (Protocol 
Amendment #3). 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 59/95 
 
 
 
 
 
The generation of an interim analysis on at least the first 1000 subjects boosted with at least 2 months 
follow-up post booster, and corresponding regulatory submission package is currently planned for Q3 
2022. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response and Conclusion: 
The issue is partly resolved. The MAH provided information on the status as requested. Interim data for 
this study are expected in Q3. The MAH is requested to submit the interim and the final clinical study 
report from study P203 Part C as soon as it becomes available. The interim CSR is expected Q3 2022. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved following a commitment by the MAH to include the data becoming available on the 
reactogenicity/safety in adolescents and young adults along with the sound data analysis in the upcoming 
interim reports from study mRNA-1273-P203 Part C. 
Question 2 
The MAH was requested to comment on the proposed boosting interval for adolescents, 
considering the slower rate decline of the immune response and the duration of protection in 
this population. 
MAH’s Response: 
The MAH explained that the booster data on shortened intervals is being extrapolated from the NIH/DMID 
21-0012 study, which included young adults (18-25 years of age), Study P201B, and post-authorisation 
safety data, in order to provide regulatory agency flexibility to best meet their local dosing interval 
recommendations. 
It is also important to note, that current post-authorisation safety data, does not distinguish the different 
dosing intervals that have been recommended for booster implementation in different countries, for 
example, France (3 months), Germany (3 months), UK (3 months), Canada - Ontario (3 months), 
Switzerland (4 months), and U.S. (5 months). By providing flexibility in the dosing interval, the decision 
when and for whom to implement a third dose of Spikevax can be made based on local recommending 
bodies needs and the evolution of the pandemic. 
Assessment of the MAH’s Response: 
In summary the MAH’s response is not satisfactory. The MAH justifies the booster interval of 3 months in 
adolescents with the extrapolation approach from young adults, without discussing the slower rate decline 
of immune response and the duration of protection in this population as requested. This should be done 
subsequently. The MAH is asked to submit and discuss: 
•all available immunogenicity data comparing the decline of antibodies in adolescents and young adults 
18-25 years of age beyond of the data from study P203 
•all available data on the duration of protection in the 2 age cohorts

•to justify the identical booster interval for the 2 groups.

Population IS/ID Modelling 
Question 3  
The MAH as asked to provide the original data set and should indicate the excluded values per study and 
reason for exclusion. The MAH should further discuss the use of appropriate methods in order to justify 
the exclusion of observed values. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
No additional data on GMTs was censored specifically for the model since all immunogenicity test values 
<LLOQ are imputed with LLOQ, as the % of <LLOQ is the same as the % of imputed LLOQ. Such that: 
• In the per-protocol immunogenicity subset, because all subjects included have SARSCoV- 2 negative 
status (RT-PCR and Elecsys serology both negative) at baseline, >95% subjects have <LLOQ at baseline 
(i.e. imputed with LLOQ at baseline). 
• At Day 57, the seroresponse rate is very high (>95%) for >=4* LLOQ if baseline <LLOQ, or >= 4 fold-
rise is baseline >=LLOQ. Thus, for Day 57, <5% subjects have <LLOQ (i.e. imputed with LLOQ) 
This data can be found in the previously submitted Immunogenicity Tables for Study P203 (Adolescent 
indication extension), Study P204 (Paediatric 6 to <12yr indication extension), Study P301 (Adult primary 
series indication), and Study P201 Part A & B (Ph2 and booster portion):

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH elaborated on the data set and below LLOQ samples. 
Conclusion 
Issue will not be further pursued  
Question 4  
The MAH is asked to justify the assumption that a linear function would be appropriate to characterise the 
drug effect. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH referred to the response provided in OC7 for the "V" scaling factor question. To summarise, 
dose effect is on MBmax, the maximum number of memory B-cells that can be formed. The MAH agreed 
the dose effect is linear. It is a simpler assumption to make given the range of doses studied (note that 
the Phase 1 50 ug data could not be used as it used a different assay). 
The MAH did not evaluate other functions, as linear function was well established in our other vaccine 
programs that used a similar IS/ID model. However, the MAH will evaluate other functions going forward. 
The MAH does not anticipate this to impact the predictive ability of the model, given that most predictions 
are being performed in dose ranges already included in the model, hence no extrapolation was 
performed, only interpolating. Secondly, the predictive ability of the model was well captured by the 
validation routines such as VPC’s and the table of % differences. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 62/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As no regulatory decision will be made based on the modelling, this concern will not be further pursued. 
Nevertheless, the justification for assuming a linear function would be appropriate to characterise the 
drug effect is still considered poor. The MAH admits that no further functions were tested and this will be 
addressed in updated version of the model. However, this is regarded inconsistent with the Modelling and 
Simulation report (p.13) where it was stated that indeed, different drug effect relationships were tested 
(linear, Emax) and it was concluded that the dose-response relationship was best described by a linear 
model. 
Conclusion 
Issue will not be further pursued in the context of this variation. 
Question 5 
The MAH is asked to provide further information on the selection of kMAB, that seems to be a sensitive 
parameter for both, primary and booster response. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The value of kMAB (secretion rate of antibody by plasma cells) was fixed and based on literature (Chen et 
al). This section in the model text has been corrected. We thank the reviewer to bringing this to notice. 
The secretion rate of antibodies is assumed to be same for plasma cells (short-lived and long-lived). The 
scaling factors reflect the proportion of the activated B cells pool converting into SLPCs and secreting the 
antibodies. Detailed assumption list is provided below regarding the model and parameters. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In response, the MAH detailed that kMAB, reflecting the secretion rate of antibody by plasma cells, was 
fixed based on literature data and reported some correction in the model text, but it is not clear which 
parts and wording has changed. Given that no regulatory decision is based on modelling and simulation, 
the issue is not further pursued. 
Conclusion 
Issue will not be further pursued in the context of this variation. 
Question 6 
Again, no further data to support the setting of this scaling factor to 0.45 could be found in the modelling 
report and should be provided. Of note, this parameter is reflected with 0.44 in the table listing the final 
parameter estimates. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The scaling factors 0.45 and 0.55 represent the percentage of activated B cells differentiating into short-
lived plasma cells and memory B cells. These parameter values were based on literature (Chen et al) and 
were fixed based on sensitivity analysis. The mentioned 0.44 value in Table 4-3 has been corrected to 
0.45 as used in the model. Detailed assumption lists are provided below regarding the model and 
parameters. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In response, the MAH detailed that also the scaling factors have been fixed based on the same publication 
that was wrongly reflected in the table listing the final parameter estimates. Fixing was based on a 
sensitivity analysis that in turn has not been provided or taken into account in the discussion to respond

to item 6. Given that no regulatory decision is based on modelling and simulation, the issue is not further 
pursued. 
Conclusion 
Issue will not be further pursued in the context of this variation. 
Question 7 
The MAH is asked to discuss the role of volume V in the modelling framework, including this would 
represent a physiological system variable or just needed to describe the data. In this regard, a re-
discussion of covariate selection is to be provided by the MAH taking other potentially clinically relevant 
covariates such as weight into account. V as the single parameter for testing covariate effects should be 
further justified. As long as no maturation is included in the model, and AGE and weight effects are not 
clearly reflected, the inclusion of data from very young subjects for model building is not supported. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As with any other model, there are certain assumptions that had to be made. We acknowledge that the 
assumption should have been clearer. The mechanistic model represented here has strong underpinnings 
of the dynamics of B-cells and the system parameters derived from literature. Our first goal was to 
represent the biology. This resulted in us capturing the trends of the observed data as raw antibody 
numbers secreted from the LLPC's and SLPC's. The surrogate for these raw antibodies generated from the 
model are the measured antibody titers. 
The volume scaling factor "V" was to link that connected the number of antibodies in the body to the 
measured antibody titer, similar to how amount in the body is related concentration measured in a PK 
model. In a PK model, Volume is defined as the proportionality constant that relates the amount in the 
body to the concentration measured. 
While we strive to provide a physiological meaning to it, in most instances, it is treated as a 
proportionality factor. Even in our case, the "V" is one such proportionality factor that scales the antibody 
numbers to the antibody titers. The expectation is that this parameter will be a function of dose and age 
as the measured titers will be a function of amount of vaccine in the body and age at which vaccine was 
received. One could argue that age and weight are correlated, so why not use weight. It turns out that 
clinically most vaccines are dose based on age and hence we stuck with this parameter. 
The plot below shows that at day 57 (after second primary series dose), within an age group there is 
clear dose-response relationship as long as there is more than one dose, except maybe for 6-12 years. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 64/95 
 
 
 
 
Further combined with the observed day 57 titer vs age plot below, there seems to be a downward trend 
with increasing age. Taking these two into account, both age and dose have an effect and having them 
together will tease out the effects of each of these parameters. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 65/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For all practical purposes, especially for clinical dosing of vaccines, age-based dosing has been the 
standard and hence we did not evaluate or consider other predictors of interest for immunogenicity 
modelling. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH’s effort to further explain the meaning of V in the modelling framework is acknowledged, 
however, the Assessor’s conclusion and issues remain from the methodological point of view (covariates, 
maturation). The MAH is also referred to the EMA Q&A document in this regard 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-
pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-questions-answers) 
Conclusion 
Issue will not be further pursued in the context of this variation. 
Question 8  
The MAH is asked to provide VPC plots stratified by age groups, study, and dose 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As requested by the reviewer the VPC plots given below are across different age groups, dose cohorts and 
by study. The prediction intervals capture 90% of the observed data.

The requested plots have been provided. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Question 9 
In order to improve the comparability between age groups and to meet the claimed EOI, the MAH is 
asked to simulate the following scenarios (OC9): 
- Adolescents receiving 50 μg booster dose 3 months and 9 months after second dose 
- Adolescents receiving 25 μg booster dose 3, 6 and 9 months after second dose 
- Adult age groups (18-25 and 18-65) receiving 50 μg booster dose 3, 6 and 9 months after second dose. 
GMT (+ 95% CI) should be provided post second dose, pre-booster and post-booster and GMFR (+95% 
CI) should be calculated and compared 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As requested by the reviewer, the two tables below represent the simulations of the alternative dosing 
scenarios. The first table is the GMT (95% CI) and the second table is the GMFR (95% CI).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
In response, the MAH provided the requested simulations, showing that indeed, no distinct selection of 
dose and timing of the booster dose could be made while comparing adolescents with adult 
subpopulations. Given that no regulatory decision is based on modelling and simulation, this is 
acceptable. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved and not further pursued in the context of this variation procedure. 
Safety 
Question 10  
Considering that Spikevax is not licensed in the US for individuals below 18 years of age for primary 
vaccination, and in the EU not yet for booster vaccination the following observations are made: 
- 
- 
-The estimated 3rd dose exposure of more 3 million doses appears unexpectedly high and should 
be confirmed and discussed.  
-On the other hand, the number of reported cases with AE in this age group is very small (45) and in 
contradiction to the estimated exposure. This number needs to be confirmed and discussed. 
The MAH is requested to describe in detail the methodology and data sources (countries/jurisdiction for 
use) that lead to the estimated exposure in the different age categories as well as estimates according to 
age and numbers of doses received. Based on this evaluation a comprehensive and comparative analysis 
(adolescents vs. young adults) and discussion of safety is expected. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Moderna supply chain estimates are used to define the number of doses SPIKEVAX distributed by 
country; however, administration data are tracked by health officials within countries receiving the 
vaccine. Therefore, Moderna estimates administration of SPIKEVAX based on information retrieved 
through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-
tracker/#vaccinations), the European Centres for Disease Control 
(https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccinetracker.html#distribution-tab), Health 
Type II variation assessment report

Canada (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/), the Swiss Federal Office of 
Public Health (https://www.covid19.admin.ch/en/epidemiologic/vacc-doses), and Our World in Data 
(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations). 
Cumulatively, as of the end of 15 February 2022, a total of 965,468,760 doses of SPIKEVAX had been 
delivered to 82 countries, and an estimated total of 568,668,391 doses of SPIKEVAX had been 
administered. North America, Europe, and Asia accounted for >90% of SPIKEVAX doses distributed and 
>85% of SPIKEVAX doses administered (Table 1). A proportion of doses distributed have been 
subsequently donated via either bilateral agreements or collaborative efforts such as COVAX. Based on 
data shared by the CDC for the US, the MAH has estimated that approximately 15% of all Moderna doses 
distributed may be part of such agreements. As tracking data on the administration of doses donated 
after initial distribution is not available at this time, the MAH has conservatively assumed that only 25% 
of these doses have been administered globally. 
Extrapolating from the proportion of US vaccine recipients to estimate global use, it is estimated that 
252,321,116 individuals received a first dose, 206,346,040 received a second dose, and 110,001,235 
received a third dose. Age, gender, and age by gender stratified assessments of observed to expected 
rates are routinely performed as has been required by regulatory authorities. Our knowledge of 
demographics for administration data is limited to the information tracked and published by health 
officials within countries receiving the vaccine. Not all health authorities provide the same age strata 
when sharing this information, and none provide demographic data that are specific by brand and dose 
number. Since a large proportion of SPIKEVAX doses to date have been administered in the US, a 
correspondingly large proportion of reported events have been identified in the US. For adults, we 
therefore applied the US age distribution to the total administered doses of vaccine administered and 
corresponding person-time accrued. Because the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for use in 
adolescents (12-17 years) in the US, it is expected that the large majority of COVID-19 vaccine doses 
seen in this age group are not Moderna’s SPIKEVAX. To account for this, we limited the total assumed 
accrued exposure in individuals < 18 years to 3% of the total. The estimate of 3% was selected based on 
the assumption that adolescent use in the United States, where approximately half of global 
administrations have occurred and authorisation is limited to age ≥ 18 years, is substantially lower than 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 75/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use in the European Economic Area, where adolescent use is authorised and approximately 6% of COVID-
19 vaccinations across all brands have been administered to individuals < 18. Based on the distribution of 
adverse event reports of all types in safety database, is it estimated that 95% of doses in individuals <18 
years of age have been administered to adolescents. Because no source has yet made available 
describing demographic characteristics of Moderna booster vaccine recipients from a major health 
authority, the MAH has for purposes of estimation applied the same age and sex distribution described for 
global vaccine recipients to each dose. Based on this assumption, it was estimated that approximately 
0.6% of globally administered doses could have been given as a third dose (either booster or primary 
series in immunocompromised persons) in persons <18 years of age. Compared to the 0.6% doses 
estimated to apply to the subgroup of children and adolescents receiving a third dose, the distribution of 
spontaneous reports to this age by dose number subgroup is lower, at 0.02% of the total cases with 
known age and dose. Generally, reporting rates are substantially lower after the third dose than after the 
primary series, with only <7% of events identified through the most recent safety summary report 
identified as following dose 3. As such, it is expected that the number of dose 3 events would be lower 
than reported adverse events for other doses and disproportionate to administration. Even taking this 
most extreme scenario of dose 3 use in adolescents as only 0.02% of the total global administered doses, 
an estimate of approximately 120,000 doses compared to the original estimate of approximately 3 
million, no emerging information concerning the safety profile of the vaccine emerges as only known 
reactogenicity symptoms are reported >1 case and only one serious event (PT of influenza) was 
identified. 
Cumulatively, Moderna had received 17,511 cases for individuals of all ages after a third dose or booster 
dose of SPIKEVAX as of 31 December 2021. From those cases, there were 45 reports concerning 
individuals <18 years of age, as reported before. See table below. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 76/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH response with regards to 3rd dose exposure reveals that the exposure number is rather based 
on assumptions than on reported information. Of note, this is due to the reporting system and the 
sources used by the company to estimate dose distribution and administration. Supply chain estimates 
are used to define the number of SPIKEVAX doses distributed by country, administration data are tracked 
by health officials within countries receiving the vaccine. Knowledge of demographics for administration 
data is limited to the information tracked and published by health officials within countries receiving the 
vaccine. Not all health authorities provide the same age strata when sharing this information, and none 
provide demographic data that are specific by brand and dose number. In fact, the previously reported 
3rd dose exposure of 3 million doses is far too high, and has been corrected to 120,000 3rd doses 
administered to individuals below 18 years of age. It should be noted, that this exposure estimation is not 
restricted to adolescents but includes also individuals below 12 years of age). The difficulties due to the 
reporting methods are acknowledged, but it is not understood, why the MAH reports such different 
numbers. The described methodology and the two largely different numbers reveal the uncertainties 
related to the 3rd dose estimation and in consequence to the calculation of related incidence rates of AEs. 
The case number of 45 cases in individuals below 18 years of age however was confirmed by the MAH, 
but is now as said related to approximately 120.000 3rd dose administrations. 42 AEs were due to 
medication error under the PT of “Product administered to patient of inappropriate age” and 
“Inappropriate schedule of product administration”. The MAH was already within the procedure asked to 
submit information with regard to the nature and severity of the remaining 3 cases and events in children 
below 18 years of age including a causality assessment. The clinical information for the remaining 3 cases 
has been submitted by the MAH as requested and is described and discussed in the AR. Two of the cases 
represent expected reactogenicity events that are labelled for Spikevax. One of these 2 cases occurred 
after heterologous booster administration (Comirnaty primary vaccination without ARs, booster with 
Spikevax 3 month after primary vaccination). The third case describes a myasthenia gravis crisis in a 16-
17 year old subject with known myasthenia gravis acquired after COVID-19. The time frames of COVID-
19 and the vaccination with 3 doses of Spikevax is not provided. A causal relationship cannot be 
excluded. Within the responses the MAH describes one SAE of influenza, which cannot be traced. The last 
part of the question has not been addressed. The MAH did not provide a comprehensive and comparative 
analysis (adolescents vs. young adults) and discussion of safety. 
Moreover, having the uncertainties with regard to the methodology of spontaneous reporting for the 
assessment of age and dose related safety evaluations in mind the submitted data from spontaneous 
reporting to the MAH is not considered adequate to support the extrapolation approach. To support the 
extrapolation approach on a larger safety database the MAH is asked to submit: 
Information on the proportion of adolescents 12-<18 years of age and young adults 18-25 years of age 
enrolled in ongoing PASSs. 
A comprehensive comparison of the reactogenicity and safety profile of adolescents versus young adults 
based on the data available in the PASSs in the 2 populations 
A comprehensive comparison of the reactogenicity and safety profile post dose 2 versus post dose 3 in 
young adults based on available safety data from PASSs. 
Conclusion  
The issue is not solved. 
To support the extrapolation approach on a larger safety database the MAH is asked to submit:

Question 11 
Reporting rates for myocarditis are given for a time frame of 7 days post dose. This is considered short 
and analyses of myocarditis cases should take an extended time frame of at least 30 days into account. 
The MAH is requested to present updated analyses. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has used the 7 days post dose analysis based on all the evaluations conducted by health 
authorities, research organisations, as well as information from the MAH’s safety database that have 
identified the 0-7 days as the greatest risk interval to experienced vaccine related myocarditis or 
pericarditis events. Analysis conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) utilising 
the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) as of 15 January 2022, showed an increased risk for myocarditis and 
pericarditis observed after both dose 1 and dose 2 of Spikevax in the 0–7-day risk interval, with a greater 
risk following dose 2 (ACIP 2022): 
•  Dose 2 adjusted rate ratio=18.75 vs. Dose 1 adjusted rate ratio=3.46 
•  Highest excess cases per million doses administered observed after dose 2 
•  31.2 excess cases in 0–7-day risk interval per million doses administered in both males and females 
•  61.8 excess cases in 0–7-day risk interval per million doses administered to males 
A population-based cohort studies in 4 Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) using 
linked data from nationwide health registers on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, myocarditis and pericarditis 
diagnoses, and other covariates, including 23.1 million residents aged 12 years or older also showed that 
rates of myocarditis and pericarditis were higher within 28 days after being vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2

mRNA vaccines compared with being unvaccinated, and that the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis were 
highest within the first 7 days of being vaccinated for all combinations of mRNA vaccines, and were more 
pronounced after the second dose (Karlstad Ø, Hovi P, Husby A, Härkänen T, Selmer RM, Pihlström N, 
Hansen JV, Nohynek H, Gunnes N, Sundström A, Wohlfahrt J, Nieminen TA, Grünewald M, Gulseth HL, 
Hviid A, Ljung R. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Myocarditis in a Nordic Cohort. Study of 23 Million 
Residents. JAMA Cardiol. 2022 Apr 20. doi: 0.1001/jamacardio.2022.0583. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 
35442390). 
The MAH updated the analysis based on the methods previously requested by PRAC for Moderna’s routine 
safety summary reports. In this analysis, person-time is estimated on the assumption of a 21-day risk 
window following each estimated dose administered, however all cases are included regardless of time to 
onset, producing a more highly sensitive estimate of the reporting rate, including data for cases beyond 
the 30-day window requested. Myocarditis (with or without pericarditis) was reported in 3,514 cases 
cumulatively (reporting rate 9.65 per 100,000 person-years) and in 497 as of 15 April 2022 (reporting 
rate 13.42 per 100,000 person-years). 
Overall, this reporting rate was similar to population-based data estimates derived from individuals 
without a diagnosis of COVID-19, between March 2020 and January 2021, from the US Premier 
Healthcare Database (Boehmer 2021). As has been described previously, there is a marked increase in 
the reporting rate of myocarditis that is observed in young men. It should be noted that the reference 
source includes slightly different age categories than are available from some public health authorities 
when describing the demographic characteristics of vaccine recipients. In this source, age groups for 
younger individuals are described as <16 (4 cases per 100,000 person-years) and 16-24 (13 cases per 
100,000 person-years). The higher reference rate is used to support observed vs. expected analyses in 
Table 4 because a large majority of adverse event reports (all terms, not limited to myocarditis) in the 
adolescent population occur in individuals ages 16-17 years of age. If instead the lower rate were to be 
selected, the observed vs. expected rate ratio would be comparable between adolescents and young 
adults (O/E in ages 12 – 17: 3.11, 95% CI 2.19 – 4.41). The reporting rate was comparable to 
population-based estimates from the US (Kang 2021: 10 per 100,000 person-years, 3,640 cases 
expected, rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 – 1.01) when considering a 21-day risk window following 
vaccination. It should be noted that background estimates of the incidence of myocarditis vary widely, 
with some sources citing a range of 1-10 cases per 100,000 person-years (Gubernot 2021) and others 
citing a range of 10-20 per 100,000 person-years (Kang 2021).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Myocarditis  and  pericarditis  have  been  observed  in  younger  men  more  often  following  the  second 
vaccination of the primary series. Uncertainties are related to the number of cases with myocarditis with or 
without pericarditis following the 3rd booster in adolescents because the exposure number is based rather 
on assumptions. However, the MAH this time has provided an extended time period of a 21-day risk window, 
with a more highly sensitive estimate of the reporting rate, including data for cases beyond the 30-day. 
The analysis has been updated based on the methods previously requested by PRAC, including cases per 
100 000 per person-year- cumulative to 15 April 2022. The higher reference rate has been used to support 
observed vs. expected analyses in Table 4 and the majority of adverse event reports (not only limited to 
myocarditis) in the adolescent population occur in individuals ages 16-17 years of age. If the lower estimate 
were to be selected, the observed vs. expected rate ratio would be comparable between adolescents and 
young adults (O/E in ages 12 – 17: 3.11, 95% CI 2.19 – 4.41). The rate O/E in the males of age group 12-
17 was 24.32/17.33 in contrary with the rate in females with O/E 1.99/ 8.67.

Conclusion 
Issue solved.  
Question 12  
IRRs from age and sex standardised comparison of post vaccination and historical incidence of AESIs 
(Table 24 in the clinical overview) cannot be interpreted without information on the underlying 
methodology of this analysis and the event numbers of each AESI. The MAH is asked to describe the 
methodology of the analysis and discuss the findings, particularly for the AESI with IRRs over 2. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
A full discussion of the study methodology and applicable underlying event rates is provided in Interim 
Report 4 of the US Post-Authorisation Safety Study (mRNA-1273-P903) submitted on 31 January 2022. 
To summarise methods of this study, this retrospective observational cohort study uses secondary, de-
identified individual-level medical and pharmacy claims data provided by HealthVerity. This data source 
includes open and closed claims for patients insured under commercial, Medicare or Medicaid plans, 
and/or served by providers participating in several large US medical and pharmacy insurance claims 
submission systems. The currently presented analyses include individuals meeting the following study 
entry criteria. Cohorts were defined separately for adults (≥18 years of age) and children/adolescents 
(<18 years of age) during each time period, overall and by subpopulation of interest (influenza 
vaccinated individuals in the pre-COVID era and immunocompromised individuals within each time 
period). To estimate incidence rate ratios for AESI, the following cohorts were formed: 
Pre-COVID and COVID era Historical Cohorts: 
• Included in a health plan covered by HealthVerity database with capture of closed 
administrative healthcare claims 
• Covered by a health plan during the pre-COVID or COVID eras 
• For analysis of each outcome, data includes a clean period (variable by AESI) of 
continuous baseline enrolment or activity before the period of interest during which the 
patient is covered by continuous health plan eligibility 
• Aged 18 years old or above at cohort entry date for the adult-specific cohorts, and under 
18 years of age at cohort entry date for the paediatric-specific cohorts 
• Non missing and non-conflicting values of gender at cohort entry date 
Qualifying individuals within the historical cohorts were then followed from the end of the clean period 
(for most outcomes, 365 days used to establish baseline characteristics and identify prevalent AESI 
diagnoses) through the end of the time period (i.e., 30 Nov 2019 for the pre-COVID era and 10 
December 2020 for the COVID era), the end of continuous health plan enrolment, or the first occurrence 
of the AESI considered in a given analysis. Similarly, the same study entry criteria were utilised to 
identify immunocompromised adult and adolescent populations within the pre-COVID and COVID era, 
where we required evidence of immunocompromised status on the cohort entry date. A summary of 
cohort selection is shown in Figure 5a. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 81/95 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-EUA Spikevax-Vaccinated Cohorts 
• Included the HealthVerity database with capture of open or closed administrative healthcare 
claims 
• At least one dose of Spikevax vaccine 
• For analysis of each outcome, data includes a clean period (variable by AESI) of continuous 
baseline enrolment or open claim activity before vaccination 
• Aged 18 years old or above at cohort entry date for the adult-specific cohorts, and under 18 
years of age at cohort entry date for the paediatric-specific cohorts 
• Non missing or conflicting values of gender at cohort entry date 
Qualifying patients in the post-EUA cohorts were then followed from the date of the first vaccine dose 
administration through the end of data availability (24 November 2021), the end of HealthVerity data 
capture (defined as the end of continuous health plan enrolment for closed claims or >60 days after the 
last healthcare encounter for those with open claims), receipt of a non-Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine, or 
the first occurrence of the AESI considered in a given analysis. A summary of cohort selection is shown in 
Figure 6. The subpopulation of Spikevax-vaccinated immunocompromised individuals used the same 
selection criteria and follow-up and were identified as having evidence of immunocompromised status on 
the day of their Spikevax vaccination. 
For analyses of a second dose of Spikevax, patients with evidence of a second dose at least 7 days after 
the first dose were identified within each AESI-specific cohort. Additionally, patients were required to not 
have the AESI of interest between the first and second dose. Individuals’ index date was set on the 
second dose of Spikevax for these analyses. 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 82/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For these cohorts, incidence rates were calculated as the number of patients with an event divided by the 
sum of person-time at risk, where person-time was the total days from the index date through the date 
of the first instance of the applicable AESI or the end of observation (i.e., earliest of end of health plan 
enrolment, end of study period, or end of data). Incidence rates are presented per 100,000 person-years 
and are shown with an associated 95% confidence interval (CI) overall and for each age, sex, and age-
by-sex specific stratum. Standardisation to the age and sex distribution of the 2019 US population was 
also performed for males and females. In the preliminary screening objective for which results were 
presented, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% CI was calculated to estimate the relative change in 
IRs in the post-EUA Spikevax vaccination cohort compared to the Pre-COVID and COVID era cohorts. 
IRRs were calculated overall and stratified by age, sex, and age by sex. 
Additional analyses are ongoing, noting that an Interim Report will be delivered for this study 30 April 
2022, which includes new analyses of these outcomes in the paediatric sub-population including self-
controlled risk interval assessments that more fully characterise these outcomes in the paediatric 
population where numbers support meaningful analyses. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided a summary of the study methodology as requested. A full description of the study 
methodology and applicable underlying event rates has been provided in Interim Report 4 of the US Post-
Authorisation Safety Study (mRNA-1273-P903) submitted on 31 January 2022. The IR 4 of mRNA-1273-
P903 has been assessed and discussed within PRAC procedure EMEA/H/C/005791/MEA/003.5. 
The results of the ESI assessment in this study were summarised by the MAH as follows: 
as follows: 
Paediatric Population 
In addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, results of the study suggested elevated crude and 
standardised IRR in one or more strata among paediatric vaccinated patients for acute kidney injury, 
anaphylaxis, anosmia, arrhythmia, Bell’s palsy, deep vein thrombosis, and erythema multiforme.  With 
respect to acute kidney injury, the standardised incidence rate ratio was elevated for the post- 
vaccination age <12 stratum of the paediatric cohort when compared to the COVID-era. Among all 
paediatric patients, the observed vs expected analysis, utilising a 28-day risk window following the first 
dose of mRNA-127, did not demonstrate an elevated O/E ratio.  However, based on an observed count of 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 83/95 
 
 
 
 
 
6 cases, O/E ratios were elevated for <12 age stratum when compared to the pre-COVID and COVID 
eras. The results of this observed vs expected analysis among paediatric patients meets the pre- specified 
criteria for a SCRI analysis. A protocol annex will be submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, 
and results will be included in Interim Report #5. 
O/E analyses of arrhythmia, Bell’s palsy, deep vein thrombosis, and erythema multiforme did not 
demonstrate a greater than expected number of events compared to expectation and thus did not move 
forward to a self-controlled analysis.  These and other AESI will continue to be monitored in subsequent 
reports.  All other outcomes did not show a meaningfully increased rate following receipt of mRNA-1273. 
Limitations  
In this study, administrative claims are used to identify diagnoses relevant to vaccine safety monitoring, 
however, estimated incidence in these settings may vary substantially based on the algorithm used. 
Algorithms that are overly sensitive may identify “rule out” or other tentative diagnoses, and this can 
inflate the apparent rate. Algorithms must therefore balance the competing objectives of sensitivity and 
specificity based on the objectives of a given study. 
Administrative claims collect data based on healthcare encounters, creating a longitudinal view of the 
patient on the basis of codes used primarily for billing. As such, conditions that do not affect 
reimbursement or come to medical attention can be missing. This type of data source also necessarily 
conflates absence of evidence with evidence of absence, which can be a source of bias. In our analysis, 
slightly lower rates of several comorbidities were observed following vaccination compared to the 
historical time frame regardless of an older age distribution. This may have multiple explanations. It is 
possible that individuals with substantial comorbidity were more likely to be vaccinated quickly in the 
campaign, which may have more often included mass vaccination centres not captured in integrated 
healthcare delivery systems or healthcare claims environments including HealthVerity. Alternatively, care 
seeking behaviour during the baseline timeframe for this population could be reduced by the pandemic, 
producing less opportunity to capture baseline health status via medical encounters for individuals 
vaccinated early on in the post-vaccination time period in the former situation, a concern may arise for 
generalisability. In the latter, control of confounding by adjustment may become questionable. Finally, 
this might be due to the healthy vaccinee effect. This would be addressed in SCRI analyses used to 
evaluate signals, however, given that this design efficiently manages time- invariant confounding. 
Specific to the paediatric population, it is noteworthy that due to patient privacy, the HealthVerity data is 
limited to reporting year of birth to indicate an individual’s age. Thus, there is the potential for 
misclassification of individuals age 18 years at the time of vaccination in the paediatric cohort. Further, 
the vaccine is not authorised for use in the paediatric population in the United States. As such, it is 
possible that some proportion of these cases could be miscoded exposures to products authorised in this 
age group. Conversely, if exposure coding is in fact accurate, it is possible that this could reflect use 
where the treating clinician saw an elevated risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions. 
Interpretation 
Interim estimates of incidence for AESI relevant to vaccine safety monitoring show substantial variation in 
estimated incidence rates by outcome, age, and gender. This was expected based on known epidemiology 
and published sources and underscores the importance of subgroup analyses as planned in our ongoing 
assessments. SCRI analyses demonstrate an increased rate of myocarditis and pericarditis most 
pronounced in young men after dose 2 which is consistent with findings from surveillance and other 
published Real-World Evidence studies. SCRI analyses to refine results for anaphylaxis, acute kidney

Page 84/95 
 
 
 
 
injury (among paediatric patients), anosmia/ageusia and Chilblain-like lesions will also be conducted and 
included in interim report #5. 
Generalisability 
Because these rates are assessed in US patients, the rates observed may be less generalisable to other 
countries or subpopulations where there are meaningful differences in the underlying risk of the AESI 
considered. Patient and population-based characteristics should be considered prior to use of these 
background rates. Further, as described in Section 11.5, it is possible that vaccinated individuals captured 
in HealthVerity data may differ from other US vaccine recipients, particularly those who accessed mass 
vaccination sites or employer-sponsored vaccination sites.  Likewise, vaccinated individuals captured in 
US claims may differ from vaccine recipients in other countries, especially where vaccination practice, 
indicated populations, and characteristics of the vaccine roll out have varied. A mechanism that would 
produce the expectation that these differences should change the relationship between vaccination and 
outcomes of interest is not presently clear, reducing the expected impact to interpretation. Lastly, it is 
notable that currently the mRNA-1273 is not authorised for emergency use among individuals <18 years 
in the United States. Thus, capture of vaccinated paediatric patients may represent a patient population 
with a different risk profile than the general paediatric population, and may include paediatric patients at 
higher risk for severe COVID-19, including those who are immunocompromised. 
PRAC discussion 
The MAH discussion has been acknowledged by PRAC with the following additional remarks: 
Most points have been addressed in previous procedures related to this PAM. In addition, the limitations 
and the generalisability of the data regarding the paediatric population were discussed: 
•  Due to patient privacy, the HealthVerity data is limited to reporting year of birth. Therefore, there is 
a potential to misclassify individuals who are 18 years of age at the time of vaccination in the 
paediatric cohort. This is in line with the fact that 63% of the paediatric cohort was 17 years old, 
potentially reflecting the reporting limitation in HealthVerity. 
•  Spikevax is not authorised for use in <18-year-olds. Therefore, for a proportion of paediatric 
individuals Spikevax exposure could have been miscoded to authorised products. Alternatively, 
clinicians may have recommended off-label use due to an elevated risk of severe COVID-19 due to 
underlying health conditions. This would impact risk estimates if the underlying conditions are 
associated with the outcomes of interest. Moreover, this paediatric population is unlikely 
representative of the general US paediatric population. 
Conclusion 
AESIs will continuously be followed by PRAC. The increased incidence rate ratios of AEs between 
vaccinated and unvaccinated <18-year-olds in this study are based on very few events, limiting the 
interpretation. A more robust observed/expected (O/E) analysis which considers relevant risk windows of 
the AESI is performed for any AESI with an IRR of ≥2 (if based on more than 5 events). This was done 
for Acute Kidney Injury where the O/E was not elevated for all <18-year-olds. It should however be 
noted, that it was elevated for <12-year-olds (based on 6 events). This potential signal will be evaluated 
via Self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis with the next interim report. PRAC does not see any 
immediate safety concern based on the data in <18-year-olds from this US PASS. 
CHMP Rapp and PRAC were in communication concerning the elevated AESI IRRs in the paediatric 
population in study mRNA-1273-P903.

supplementary information 
9.1.  Other concerns 
Safety 
1) To support the extrapolation approach on a larger safety database the MAH is asked to 
submit: 
a) Information on the proportion of adolescents 12-<18 years of age and young adults 18-25 
years of age enrolled in ongoing PASSs. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has two ongoing PASS that include children and adolescents using Spikevax in routine clinical 
practice, namely mRNA-1273-P903 in the US, and mRNA-1273-P904 in Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain, 
and the United Kingdom. 
In study mRNA-1273-P903 in the US where Spikevax has been approved in adults only, the study 
population described in Interim Report #5 (30 April 2022) includes data captured through November 
2022 and includes 18,161,726 adults and 101,083 children/adolescents <18 years of age (off-label) 
exposed to Spikevax. Data on dose 3 were not available in the interim report but will be described in 
Interim Report #6 (scheduled on 31 July 2022). Considering updated Health Verity data through 02 
February 2022, the study has identified 2,760,791 vaccinated individuals ages 18-29 years and 233,618 
third dose recipients in this age range. Of the 79,670 presumably off-label vaccine recipients ages 12-17 
identified, 2,152 received a third dose. As of the latest data cut received from Health Verity, there have 
not been any cases of myocarditis following a third dose identified in adolescents in the study, noting that 
full analyses of AESI following a third dose of Spikevax are anticipated in the 31 July 2022 interim report. 
To date, no outcome that has completed the signal evaluation phase analyses has shown a statistically 
increased risk specific to adolescents, noting that sample size is small and use off-label. 
In Study mRNA-1273-P904, Interim Report 2 included descriptive analyses and preliminary analyses from 
Italy (data through July 2021) and the United Kingdom (data through December 2021); Spikevax is 
authorised in both countries for use in adolescents 12 to 17 years old. In Italy, there were 21,599 
individuals ages 12-17 with at least one dose of Spikevax (6.2% of all Spikevax recipients in the study 
cohort), however the last date of data availability was prior to availability of booster doses. In the United 
Kingdom, there were 1,699 children and adolescents included in the study cohort (0.8% of total). No 
adolescents receiving a third dose were observed, however only 1% of all vaccinees in the study 
population for any age received a third dose. This study considers all AESI and has not to date identified 
differences in the safety profile between adolescents and young adults. Interim Report # 3 will be 
submitted on 30 September 2022. 
An updated report from the US PASS study describing safety data from young adults boosted with mRNA-
1273 is included in this submission.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided an update on the use of Spikevax in adolescents and young adults. Further, 
reference is made to upcoming interim reports from studies P903 and P904 that will provide additional 
info. The MAH mentioned an updated report which is missing in the present submission. However, overall 
the response is considered appropriate for the time being. The upcoming reports shall be submitted 
immediately upon availability. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
b) A comprehensive comparison of the reactogenicity and safety profile of adolescents versus 
young adults based on the data available in the PASSs in the 2 populations 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Reactogenicity post-booster (50 μg booster) dose has been observed to be less than post-dose 2 (100 μg 
dose) in the MAH’s clinical trials in adults (Study 201B and Study 301). This has been confirmed in the V-
Safe system health check-in survey monitoring conducted by the US CDC, in all adults (Hause, et al., 
2022), as well as in the post-authorisation safety data collected in the MAH global safety database. The 
MAH would like to further clarify that no additional PASS data is available beyond what has been 
previously provided during review, and further that reactogenicity is not captured in post-authorisation 
studies. Please refer to Section 2.5.6 Overview of Safety (m2.5 Clinical Overview) for a detailed analysis 
of (i) reactogenicity and safety profile of a 100 ug primary series in adolescents & young adults from 
clinical studies and post-authorisation (Section 2.5.6.1.1); (ii) summary of reactogenicity and safety 
profile of a 50 μg booster dose (see also, Booster series submission PM-2021-05131-1-2). 
There are two ongoing PASS that include children and adolescents using Spikevax in routine clinical 
practice. Both studies include vaccine recipients of all ages and are designed to characterise risk of 
adverse events of special interest to support enhanced understanding of the safety profile of Spikevax. 
Because both studies are conducted using routinely collected administrative healthcare data, they are 
poorly suited to characterisation of reactogenicity. The majority of reactogenicity events are expected to 
be managed at home, and they are considered expected and are often transient in duration. These events 
are not well captured in administrative databases, given that the inclusion of diagnosis codes used in case 
ascertainment is driven by reimbursement of healthcare encounters. As such, reactogenicity outcomes 
have not been included in the study protocols previously discussed and approved by the EMA and US 
FDA. As stated in response to item #1, preliminary analyses are limited due to exclusively off-label use in 
the United States and longer data lags in the European study. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarifies that no data in addition to the already submitted are available on the reactogenicity and 
safety in the mentioned population groups. At the present point in time the available data do not provide 
any evidence of enhanced reactogenicity/adverse events after the booster dose. Therefore, the answer 
given by the MAH can be accepted for the time being; however, the MAH is requested to include any data 
becoming available on the reactogenicity/safety in adolescents and young adults as well their analysis in 
the upcoming interim reports (see 1a).

Conclusion 
Issue solved with the commitment from the MAH to present additional analyses of the outcomes of 
ongoing safety-related studies in the next full Interim Report. 
c) A comprehensive comparison of the reactogenicity and safety profile post dose 2 versus 
post dose 3 in young adults based on available safety data from PASSs. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Data concerning the dose specific safety profile for SPIKEVAX are currently available based on the US 
Post Authorisation Safety Study (PASS), study mRNA-1273-P903. Due to the data lags of participating 
sites for the European PASS (mRNA-1273-P904), no information concerning the safety of dose 3 has yet 
been identified in that setting. Both studies consider myocarditis, pericarditis, and other AESI relevant to 
vaccine safety monitoring, however there is no assessment of reactogenicity. This is due to the fact that 
these outcomes are not typically well captured in the administrative data sources used by the projects. 
Interim Report 5 of study mRNA-1273-P903 was submitted on 27th April 2022, and contained data 
through 24th November 2021. Given this data lag, dose 3 analyses had not yet been conducted. In 
support of the query in Item 3, the MAH has expedited selected analyses planned for Interim Report 6 to 
assess the differences in the safety profile of dose 2 and dose 3. Specifically, analyses were conducted 
comparing historical incidence rates and post-vaccination incidence rates for non-pregnancy related 
adverse events of special interest (AESI) after dose 2 and dose 3 in young adults (18-25 years). A full 
study report including the final version of these and other analyses for study mRNA-1273-P903 will be 
submitted in Interim Report 6 on 31 July 2022. 
Within young adults 18 to 29 years of age, there were 1,828,649 individuals who received a second and 
244,334 individuals who received a third dose of SPIKEVAX, respectively. Considering the overall 
incidence rate ratios of AESI after SPIKEVAX versus incidence in the pre-COVID era, results for dose 2 
and dose 3 analyses were comparable for most outcomes. Based on Health Verity data in young adults 
18-29 years of age, the crude incidence rate ratio was ≥ 2 for myocarditis and anosmia after dose 2 and 
dose 3 of SPIKEVAX. Skin reactions may be increased, with Chilblain like lesions and erythema 
multiforme meeting this threshold after dose 3 but not after dose 2. Given that the dose 3 cohort included 
only 244,334 individuals in the age group of interest, estimates of incidence for very rare AESI are in 
some cases imprecise. 
Per protocol, observed to expected analyses considering the etiologically relevant time period after 
vaccination were conducted for myocarditis, pericarditis, and other AESIs with a crude incidence rate ratio 
≥ 2 with at least 5 cases observed. The expected background rates presented here were estimated using 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 89/95 
 
 
 
 
the pre-COVID era cohort. For these analyses, myocarditis and pericarditis were assessed using a 7-day 
risk window. Chilblain-like lesions, anosmia, and erythema multiforme considered a 28-day risk window. 
Across these outcomes, the safety profile of dose 3 and dose 2 appears to be similar, with results for dose 
2 and dose 3 more similar for chilblain-like lesions in the 28-day risk interval (Table 2 below) than in all 
person-time after vaccination. A possible exception is erythema multiforme, which is currently undergoing 
further evaluation in advance of Interim Report 6. There appears to be a small reduction in the risk of 
myocarditis observed, however estimates are very imprecise. Additional analyses of these outcomes will 
be presented in the next full Interim Report. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has conducted analyses to identify risk ratios in younger adults (18-29 years of age) of selected 
adverse events after vaccination in comparison to the pre-COVID era. The initial results indicated 
potential higher risk after the third dose for Myocarditis, Pericarditis, Chilblain like Lesions and Erythema 
Multiforme. Therefore, these AE (plus Anosmia) were further investigated by an observed vs expected 
analysis. Except for Erythema Multiforme, which will be further monitored, no increased risk rate after the 
third dose could be detected. The MAH commits to include additional analyses of adverse events in the 
next full interim report. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved with the commitment from the MAH to present additional analyses of the outcomes of 
ongoing safety-related studies in the next full Interim Report. 
Immunogenicity 
2) Regarding the dosing interval of 3 months for the 3rd booster dose after initial vaccination 
in the adolescent age group (≤12 – 18 years) the MAH is asked to submit and discuss: 
a) all available immunogenicity data comparing the decline of antibodies in adolescents and 
young adults 18-25 years of age beyond of the data from study P203 
b) all available data on the duration of protection in the 2 age cohorts 
c) as far as available: clinical post authorisation immunogenicity data (including published 
literature) beyond study NIH/DMID 21-0012 that could further support the booster 
interval for adolescents 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Reference is made to the MAH’s response to EMA Clinical Questions Q2 (28 Apr22 to 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/57 Response to RSI) stating that the shortened booster interval of 3 months was 
requested to provide regulatory agencies the flexibility to best comply with local dosing interval 
recommendations, the current surge in cases linked to the emergence of VOC, the potential for 
emergence of other VOCs. The currently approved interval for Spikevax booster administration to adults 
(≥ 18 year) by EMA is 3m (intervals from 3-6m are approved/recommended globally). Based on 
demonstrated immunobridging of the primary series of mRNA-1273 between adolescents and young 
adults (in study P203), extrapolation from adult booster recipients to adolescents is applied here. 
Accordingly, if the agency deems appropriate an interval of 6m based on the clinical trial data collected in 
P301, P201 Part B, P203 Part C can be considered for adolescent boosters in EU. Recent data from

adolescent study P203 regarding the monthly incidence rates (graphed per person months) allows 
examination of the influence of emerging variants on duration of protection (Figure below). 
This figure provides long-term assessment of monthly incidence rates among all mRNA-1273 adolescent 
recipients remaining on study as of the 31 Jan 2022 data cut. Although no placebo control group is 
available (as the study had been unblinded and placebo participants had sought vaccination), results 
shows low monthly incidence rates of COVID-19 among participants until November 2021. Even during 
the US Delta surge (July to September 2021), incidence rates among vaccinated study participants 
(adolescents) generally remained stable. Not unexpectedly, an increase in COVID 19 incidence was 
observed in the months of December 2021 and January 2022 (9 to 12 months after dose 2), when the 
Omicron variant prevailed. These findings are consistent with real-world increases in COVID-19 incidence 
during the US Omicron surge (December to January). This surge occurred 9 to 12 months after receipt of 
Dose 2 of mRNA-1273 in those who were initially randomised to mRNA-1273. The rise in incidence among 
study participants coincided with the prevalence of the Omicron variant with its more divergent sequence 
and potentially with concurrent waning immunity after Dose 2.  
Although long-term (>6m post-dose 2) adolescent primary series antibody data is not available, Moderna 
has been tracking the persistence and durability of the immune response against the ancestral strain as 
well as variants in adult clinical trials where booster doses are being investigated. Administration of the 
mRNA-1273 booster leads to increase in neutralising antibody titers against the ancestral strain, Beta 
variant and Delta variant. Immunogenicity data against the Omicron variant (N=20) over time 
demonstrates detectable nAb ID50 titers at 1 month post-dose 2, which wanes over 6 months to a value 
which is at the limit of detection. 
As described in the m2.5 Clinical overview (section 2.5.5.1.2), a 50 μg boost in Study P201 Part B 
resulted in a 15.06 GMFR between pre-booster and post-booster titers, against the prototype strain. The 
50 μg boost also resulted in marked higher titers compared with the Day 28 post-primary series (post-
dose 2) titer in Study P301, in which efficacy was established. This booster also induced ID50 GMTs 
against the Omicron variant that were 20 fold higher than those assessed 1 month after the second 
vaccination.

Corresponding with these induced increases in nAb levels, booster inoculation (50 ug mRNA-1273) of 
adults enrolled in the ongoing vaccine effectiveness study with Kaiser Southern California demonstrated 
enhanced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against both Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE against 
Omicron infection increased from 44% after dose 2 to 72% after booster (Figure below). 
The demonstrated similar immunobridging and effectiveness profiles of two doses of 100 ug in 
adolescents and in adults (study P203) forms the basis to extrapolate the behaviour of the 50 ug mRNA 
booster dose. Data from adults shows that booster administration enhances nAb levels (including against 
the Omicron variant) and adult vaccine effectiveness studies show improved effectiveness against 
Omicron. These same benefits would thus be anticipated to be conferred to adolescents receiving the 
mRNA-1273 booster (50 ug). As also noted by the Rapporteur, there is currently no scientifically justified 
reason to assume that booster immune responses in these two age groups should differ significantly while 
primary vaccination responses are highly comparable. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response: 
The MAH has provided additional data as regards the timing and dosage of the booster dose as 
requested. The timing of booster from 3 months post second dose is endorsed as it provides sufficient 
flexibility. Further, also the boost dose of 50 µg is considered sufficiently confirmed by the study data 
available and is expected to be applicable also to adolescents. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
Commitment 
The MAH is requested to submit the interim and the final clinical study report on results from 
study P203 Part C as soon as it becomes available. The interim CSR is expected Q3. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that the generation of an interim analysis on at least the first 1000 subjects boosted

with at least 2 months follow-up post booster, is currently planned to be available Q3 2022. This will 
include a summary of the data with supportive TFLs, no formal CSR will be available at that time. A full 
CSR will be available late Q1 2023 when a median of 6 months of follow-up post booster and a database 
lock will occur. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH confirms that the current plan for submission of the interim CSR is still Q3 2022. Further, the 
MAH states that the full CSR will be available late in Q1 2023. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved. 
OVERALL CONCLUSION AFTER ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSES CIRCULATED ON 21 JUNE 2022 
Most of the open issues are solved and the open issue (point 1b) is considered resolved following the MAH 
commitment to include the data becoming available on the reactogenicity/safety in adolescents and 
young adults along with the sound data analysis in the upcoming interim reports from study mRNA-1273-
P203 Part C. All issues are therefore considered resolved. 
10.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit-risk balance 
With this submission the MAH requested an extension of the approved booster indication for adults (i.e. 
one 50 μg booster dose administered at least three months after completion of primary vaccination) to 
adolescents (12 to < 18 years). Only a homologous booster dose after primary vaccination with Spikevax 
is proposed by the MAH for this adolescent population. The data submitted in support of this proposed 
extension of indication is rather heterogeneous and contains information compiled from multiple sources 
and study scenarios.  
Efficacy/Immunogenicity 
No specific data for efficacy, immunogenicity or effectiveness of booster vaccination in the targeted age 
group of adolescents have been provided by the MAH. Rather, evidence from multiple clinical studies – 
mostly not including the adolescent age group - and “real world data” from effectiveness studies have 
been compiled to substantiate the proposed indication extension. In essence, these include: 
- 
- 
- 
Efficacy of a primary vaccination series in adults and young adults from clinical study mRNA-1273-
P301 
Immunogenicity results in young adults (≥18 to 25 years of age) receiving booster doses in clinical 
studies mRNA-1273-P201 Part B, DMID Study 21-0012, mRNA-1273-P301, and post-licensure. 
Immuno-bridging for primary vaccination responses in adolescents and young adults based on 
immunogenicity data from study mRNA-1273-P203 (12 to <18 years of age) and study mRNA-1273-
P301 (≥18 to 25 years of age). 
-  DMID 21-0012 Study results for heterologous booster indication in adults 
- 
Published Post-licensure Booster Vaccine Effectiveness data  
The majority of these data have already been submitted and evaluated in the context of previously 
completed regulatory procedures: 
- 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021: Extension of primary immunisation indication from adults to adolescents 
Type II variation assessment report  
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0057 – Spikevax adolescent boost 
Page 93/95 
 
 
 
 
12 - <18 years of age 
- 
EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0042: Indication for heterologous boosting in adults 18 years of age and older 
As a whole, these data are considered relevant to justify the claim for the extension of the current 
booster indication for Spikevax to adolescents, even in the current absence of adolescent-specific data in 
terms of efficacy/immunogenicity. In particular, the comparison of vaccine-induced nAB titers after 
primary vaccination in young adults and adolescents confirms the equivalence of the measured immune 
responses in these two age groups. There is currently no scientifically justified reason to assume that 
booster immune responses in these two age groups should differ significantly while primary vaccination 
responses are highly comparable.  
Modelling for immunogenicity 
Of note, the MAH has developed a population IS/ID model to support the extension of the 50 µg booster 
dose in the adolescent population. However, such a modelling approach has not been used before in any 
regulatory evaluation regarding the determination of vaccine efficacy or immunogenicity. It is therefore 
deemed premature to include such a totally new approach that has no regulatory/procedural precedent in 
the context of this variation procedure. Nevertheless, the modelling approach as such has been soundly 
evaluated and certain weaknesses and deficiencies have been discussed and assessed as listed in the RSI 
section of this report. Importantly, the model has not been included in the regulatory decision-making for 
the present variation procedure. 
Safety 
As explained already in terms of efficacy, the safety database submitted is also quite diverse. It includes 
safety data from the above-mentioned clinical trials in adults and adolescents for primary vaccination and 
booster vaccination in adults. Further, post-authorisation data and data from pharmacovigilance 
monitoring are included.  
As for the efficacy part above, no study data are currently available as regards the safety profile of a 
booster dose in adolescents. Data from primary vaccination studies indicate that the local reactogenicity 
in the age cohort 12 to <18 years of age is slightly increased when compared to the age cohort 18 to 25 
years of age. No clinical meaningful difference could be observed for solicited systemic ARs. The incidence 
of systemic solicited ARs tended to be comparable or slightly higher in the age cohort 18 to 25 years of 
age compared with the adolescents after primary immunisation. In summary, no clinical meaningful 
difference in reactogenicity were detected after full primary vaccination with Spikevax in adolescents and 
young adults 18-25 years of age. There is at current no scientific reason to expect a significantly 
different/adverse safety/reactogenicity profile after the booster dose in adolescents. However, to support 
this extrapolation, the MAH was requested within the first round of RSI to provide a comprehensive and 
comparative analysis (adolescents vs. young adults) and discussion of safety based on post-marketing 
data. The post-marketing surveillance data include safety data from adults and adolescents. The reviewed 
safety data do not raise concerns regarding the administration of a 50 µg booster dose of Spikevax to 
adolescents at least 3 months after full primary vaccination with Spikevax. The performed expected 
versus observed analysis as well as the reporting rates of myocarditis within 7 days after Dose 1, 2, and 
3 are in line with what is currently known about mRNA vaccine-associated myocarditis. In adolescents, so 
far, no cases of myocarditis post dose 3 have been recorded in the MAH safety database.  
Overall conclusion 
With the submission of responses circulated on 21st June 2022, most of the identified open issues from 
the first RSI were adequately resolved. The one remaining issue (point 1b) was resolved by commitment 
by the MAH to include the data becoming available on the reactogenicity/safety in adolescents and young 
adults along with the sound data analysis in the upcoming interim reports from study mRNA-1273-P203 
Part C.

As a result, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of Spikevax remains positive after 
implementation of the indication for a booster dose in adolescents 12 – 18 years of age.

Summary 
A booster dose of Spikevax should be given intramuscularly to individuals 12 years of age and older at 
least 3 months after completion of the primary series.  
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed more often after the second dose compared to the first 
dose, and more often in younger males. The risk profile appears to be similar for the second and the third 
dose.

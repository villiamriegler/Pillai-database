2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant condition involving the TSC1 (encoding 
hamartin, chromosome 9) and/or TSC2 genes (encoding tuberin, chromosome 16) and has a 
prevalence of approximately 1 in 6,000 live births. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 are found in 80% 
to 85% of patients and a wide spectrum of mutations results in mTOR hyperactivity. When either TSC1 
or TSC2 are deficient, mTORC1 is constitutively upregulated, leading to the formation of hamartomas 
throughout the body. Lesions can occur in the kidneys, brain, heart, liver, lungs and skin.  
The disease expression is highly variable, with manifestations ranging from mild skin findings to 
seizures, learning disabilities, mental retardation, autism and fatal renal, cardiac or pulmonary disease. 
TSC patients most often present with neurologic symptoms and up to 90% of patients experience 
seizures. Half of patients experience cognitive impairment, autism or other behavioural disorders and 
renal disease is the leading cause of death or disability in adults with TSC (haemorrhage or renal 
failure). Benign skin lesions occur in nearly all patients. A limited number of features are responsible 
for the decreased life expectancy and these include:  
•  Neurologic disorders (SEGAs and seizures) 
•  Renal disease (angiomyolipomas) 
• 
•  Cardiovascular disease (rhabdomyoma and aneurysm) 
Pulmonary disease (lymphangioleiomyomatosis and bronchopneumonia) 
SEGA and its treatment  
Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are typically slow-growing, glioneuronal tumours 
arising near the foramen of Monro which develop in 5% to 20% of patients with TSC. SEGAs represent 
25% of the excess mortality due to TSC and represent a significant medical risk for this population, 
including the potential for sudden death secondary to acute hydrocephalus which is directly 
proportional to tumour volume. As SEGAs enlarge, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, new 
neurologic deficits, or deterioration of seizure control are observed. Asymptomatic lesions can progress 
to obstructing the foramen of Monro in as little as 18 months. 
Surgical removal of SEGA lesions is currently the treatment of choice, although the timing of surgery is 
considered to be controversial. It has been noted that major complications tend to occur more 
frequently in patients who are symptomatic for raised intracranial pressure or major hydrocephalus 
before surgery. The rationale for early surgery appears to be to avoid the complications of raised 
intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. In the majority of cases with a macroscopically complete 
resection, the surgery can be considered curative as the lesion does not recur. 
SEGAs may in some cases prove to be non-resectable due to their location, (e.g., in the region of the 
hypothalamus or pineal gland), the presence of peritumoural oedema, or invasion of surrounding 
normal brain tissue. Surgery, even when successful, can result in a significant risk of peri- and post-
operative complications including meningitis, haematomas, hemiparesis, adhesions and incomplete 
resection.  
Everolimus (Afinitor/Certican/Votubia/Zortress) is a selective inhibitor of mTOR. Everolimus was 
initially developed to prevent allograft rejection following solid organ transplantation. The development 
program was expanded in 2002 to treat patients with advanced renal cell cancer (RCC), advanced 
neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and metastatic breast cancer (Afinitor), subependymal giant cell 
astrocytoma (SEGA) associated TSC and renal angiomyolypoma associated with TSC. The product 
Votubia (everolimus) has been approved for the following indications: 
Votubia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/39285/2014 
Page 7/76 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 
Votubia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated 
with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who are at risk of complications (based on factors such 
as tumour size or presence of aneurysm, or presence of multiple or bilateral tumours) but who 
do not require immediate surgery. 
The evidence is based on analysis of change in sum of angiomyolipoma volume. 
•  Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 
Votubia is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 3 years and older with subependymal 
giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who require 
therapeutic intervention but are not amenable to surgery. 
The evidence is based on analysis of change in SEGA volume. Further clinical benefit, such as 
improvement in disease-related symptoms, has not been demonstrated. 
This application concerns a grouped type II variation and a line extension. 
The scope of the variation was to: 
•  Update the SmPC based on data from the phase-III randomized placebo-controlled trial in 
patients with TSC who have SEGA (Study M2301), and longer-term follow-up from the phase-
II trial (Study C2485). 
• 
Provide new information in patients < 3 years of age (approximately 17% of patients in Study 
M2301). 
•  Revise the indication to “Votubia is indicated for the treatment of patients with SEGA 
associated with TSC who require therapeutic intervention and who are not likely to require 
surgery” to more accurately reflect the population studied. 
•  Revise the starting dose (from 3 mg/m2 to 4.5 mg/m2) as well as the target trough range 
(from 5 to 15 ng/mL to 3 to 15 ng/mL) for patients with TSC who have SEGA. 
Changes were proposed to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. Minor revisions were also 
proposed to SmPC section 4.4. 
Consequential changes were proposed to PL sections 1 and 2. 
The purpose of the line extension was to: 
•  Seek marketing approval for an age-appropriate formulation (Votubia 2 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg 
dispersible tablets) for satisfying the agreement for an age appropriate formulation (i.e. 
dispersible tablets) in the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP). 
Changes specific to the line extension are proposed to SmPC sections 1, 2, 3, 4.2, 6 and 8. 
Consequential changes are proposed to PL sections 3, 5 and 6. In addition, a new section "Instructions 
for Use" has been added. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
The medicinal product is presented as dispersible tablets containing 2mg, 3mg and 5mg of everolimus 
as active substance. Other ingredients are crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, mannitol, 
microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, silica colloidal anhydrous, hypromellose and 
Butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). 
Votubia 
Assessment report

Page 8/76 
 
 
 
 
The dispersible tablets are packed in double-sided aluminium blisters with PA/AL/PVC as forming foil 
and aluminium with a vinyl/acryl resin based heat seal lacquer as lidding foil. 
2.2.1.  Active Substance 
The active substance everolimus used for the manufacture of Votubia 2mg, 3mg and 5mg dispersible 
tablets is of the same quality as that one used for the already marketed Afinitor and Votubia tablets, as 
well as Certican tablets and dispersible tablets.  
Information concerning the active substance of this line extension reference can be found in the 
published EPAR of Votubia EMEA/H/C/2311.  
2.2.2.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development  
The active substance everolimus (40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin) is a macrocyclic lactone with 
potent anti-proliferative and immunosuppressant properties which is derived by chemical modification 
from the natural product rapamycin. Its physico-chemical properties were taken into account to 
prepare the intermediate (solid dispersion) and the finished product (tablets). Everolimus is 
hydrophobic, practically insoluble in water, soluble in organic solvents, chemically unstable above room 
temperature, and sensitive to light. Particle size of the active substance was considered not relevant 
for the quality of the finished product, since the amorphous active substance is dissolved to prepare 
the intermediate solid dispersion. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality compliant with Ph. Eur. 
Standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
As the formulation of everolimus dispersible tablets is compositionally similar to everolimus immediate 
release tablets, the same formulation principle was employed. The main difference of the dispersible 
form is that it contains microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol and silica colloidal anhydrous and no lactose 
anhydrous.  
The ideal dosage form for a hydrophobic, poorly soluble and chemically instable active substance is a 
solid dispersion where the active substance is dispersed in a water-soluble carrier.  
The same solid dispersion was used for everolimus 2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg immediate release tablets. 
The formulation used during the clinical studies was the same as the final formulation. 
With regard to dissolution, the dissolution method selected for everolimus 2mg, 3mg and 5mg 
dispersible tablets was the same as the one authorised for everolimus immediate release tablets. It 
was demonstrated during the validation studies that the proposed method was suitable for analysis of 
dissolution samples of all strengths. All three dosage strengths released more than 85% of the active 
substance in 15 minutes. According to current Guidance on waivers of in vivo bioavailability and 
bioequivalence studies for immediate-release solid oral dosage forms based on a biopharmaceutics 
classification system, for release profiles reaching 85% in 15 minutes, no similarity factor should be 
calculated. Therefore, the dissolution profiles of 2 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg dispersible tablets were 
considered similar without f2 factor calculation and the claimed biowaiver for the 3mg accepted. 
Comparative dissolution studies were carried out in the Bioequivalence (BE) study, and compared the 
immediate release tablets and the dispersible tablets. The dissolution profiles were found to be 
different. Therefore the BE result as well as the comparative dissolution shows that the proposed 
Votubia 
Assessment report

Page 9/76 
 
 
 
 
dispersible tablets are not interchangeable with the authorised immediate release tablets. This fact has 
been stated in the proposed SmPC. 
During pre-validation, three full scale batches were manufactured to prove operational ranges and to 
establish in-process controls and specifications. Moreover, potentially critical process parameters which 
have been identified during process development were studied in detail.  
The pre-validation results demonstrate that the manufacturing process of everolimus 2mg, 3mg and 
5mg dispersible tablets is robust and consistently yields to products meeting the pre-determined 
quality characteristics. Furthermore, the chosen in-process tests have been shown to be suitable for 
monitoring the manufacturing process. 
Based on experience gained from the registration stability studies, everolimus 2 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg 
dispersible tablets will be packed in double-sided aluminium blisters with PA/AL/PVC as forming foil and 
aluminium with a vinyl/acryl resin based heat seal lacquer as lidding foil. The blisters are then packed 
in a cardboard based pack. The suitability of the container closure system for packaging everolimus 
tablets is demonstrated in stability studies. The materials were in line with the EU guidelines on plastic 
primary packaging materials.  
Adventitious agents 
The only excipient from animal origin is lactose monohydrate. Magnesium stearate is of vegetable 
origin. Lactose is derived from milk suitable for human consumption and is prepared from calf rennet 
only in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal 
Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMEA/410/01/01 
Rev. 3). Therefore no TSE risk is anticipated. 
Manufacture  
The manufacture of everolimus 2mg, 3mg and 5mg dispersible tablets is a two-step process. The first 
step is the preparation of the solid dispersion of the active substance (i.e. pharmaceutical 
intermediate) which is processed, in a second step, with the other excipients to obtain the everolimus 
dispersible tablets (i.e. medicinal product).  
The manufacture of this dispersion consists of standard processes with appropriate in-process control 
testing. Process parameters are either fixed or easily met operational ranges are established. The 
dispersion is tested in accordance with an intermediate monograph. All testing procedures are 
described and validated.  
Batch results of ten production batches of everolimus solid dispersion consistently met the specified 
acceptance criteria of the solid dispersion.  
The dispersible tablets are proportional and are manufactured from the same solid dispersion and 
tabletting blend. The tabletting mixture is prepared with conventional mixing and sieving procedures 
and final  compression. Appropriate in process controls and limits during tabletting such as average 
mass, hardness, friability and disintegration time were carried out.  
The manufacturing process and in-process controls meet the current standards of pharmaceutical 
technology and are suitable to guarantee an appropriate quality of the medicinal product.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

Specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specification for the 2 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg everolimus 
dispersible tablets include appropriate tests for appearance-shape, colour, debossment (visual), 
identification of everolimus (UV and HPLC), identification of BHT (GC), mean mass, disintegration 
time(Ph. Eur.), fineness of dispersion (Ph.Eur.), dissolution after 15 min (HPLC), water content by Karl 
Fischer, degradation products (HPLC), microbial enumeration tests (plate-count method, Ph.Eur. 
harmonised ICH method), uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (HPLC, Ph. Eur. 2.9.40), 
assay of BHT (GC), assay of everolimus (HPLC). Analytical methods were described and non 
compendial methods were validated in line with ICH guidelines.  
The specification was justified and the limits for the degradation products do not raise any safety 
concern and are in line with ICH guideline Q6A ‘Specifications: Test procedures and acceptance criteria 
for new active substances and new medicinal products: Chemical substances’ and ICH guideline Q3B 
(R2) ‘Impurities in new medicinal products’. 
Batch analysis results on six production-scale batches of each strength confirm consistency and 
uniformity of the manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. 
Stability  
The stability study for everolimus solid dispersion is not included in this dossier. However, the data 
were presented during assessment of the already approved everolimus immediate release tablets 
(Afinitor, Votubia). Based on the stability data, a satisfactory shelf life can be assigned for the 
everolimus solid dispersion.  
Stability results on three production-scale batches of each strength of everolimus dispersible tablets 
stored under long term (25°C / 60%RH, 12 months), intermediate (30°C / 75%RH, 12 months), 
accelerated (40°C / 75%RH, 6 months), high temperature (50°C, 3 months) according to ICH 
conditions were presented. The tablets were kept in the commercial packaging. Stability testing 
parameters included appearance, water content, disintegration time, fineness of dispersion, 
dissolution, assay of everolimus, BHT and degradation products, hardness testing and microbiological 
quality (initial and end time points). The analytical methods were stability indicating. 
The proposed dispersible tablets were also exposed to freeze/thaw condition. One batch of each 
strength was exposed to four freeze/thaw cycles with freezing at -20°C. Analysis after 28 days 
following the cycles shows no significant effect on assay, impurities and physical stability parameter 
including tablet disintegration. 
Photostability data in line with ICH requirement has been carried out for two batches of 2mg, 3mg and 
5mg dispersible tablets. Significant difference was observed between tablets exposed to light stress 
condition and unexposed control samples stored in the blisters. Therefore it can be concluded that 
everolimus tablets is sensitive to light and should be stored protected from light. The proposed 
commercial packaging was shown to provide adequate protection. 
In accordance with the Note for Guidance on Start of Shelf-life of the Finished Dosage form, the shelf-
life of the medicinal product will start with the production date of everolimus solid dispersion. 
Based on the available data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable.

2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Data on development, manufacture and control of these dispersible tablets containing 2mg, 3mg and 
5mg of everolimus has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The ideal dosage form for a 
hydrophobic poorly soluble and chemically instable active substance is a solid dispersion where the 
drug substance is dispersed in a water-soluble carrier.  As the formulation of everolimus dispersible 
tablets is compositionally similar to everolimus immediate release tablets, the same formulation 
principle was employed. The compendial excipients selected for the formulation are commonly used in 
pharmaceutical tablet formulations. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the medicinal 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Based on the data provided, the quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable. 
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have 
been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support this new application, the MAH has provided an overview with the known 
pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of everolimus supplemented by one additional 
pharmacokinetic study investigating the brain distribution of everolimus in rats after oral 
administration of 3 mg/kg everolimus with and without oral co-administration of 10 mg/kg 
cyclosporine.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The MAH did not submit pharmacology studies with this application. 
The MAH presented evidence on the development of the blood-brain barrier in response to questions 
from the CHMP. The majority of the literature indicates that the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) develops 
during foetal life and is well formed by birth, especially to proteins and macromolecules although for 
non-human mammals born in a relatively immature state (such as rat and mouse), many transport 
mechanisms may continue to mature after birth3.

Study R1000720 examined the distribution of everolimus to brain cortex and CSF in rats after oral 
administration of 3 mg/kg everolimus with and without oral co-administration of 10 mg/kg 
cyclosporine. 
Assay methods 
Everolimus was stated to have been determined in human and animal blood by HPLC coupled to LC-MS 
or by specific ELISA. The limit of quantification (LoQ) was stated to be 0.3 to 1ng/ml and 2ng/mL 
respectively. The ELISA method was stated to have been validated against LC-MS and correlated within 
a 95% confidence interval. Everolimus was stated to be stable in human and animal blood over the 
time of sample processing and analysis. 
Distribution 
The determination of the test compound in the blood, CSF and brain cortex homogenates was by LC-
MS/MS. In the rat, the blood-brain passage of everolimus and/or its metabolites was found to be dose 
dependent, consistent with saturation of an efflux pump at the blood-brain barrier. After administration 
there was a rapid uptake of everolimus in the brain cortex followed by a slow efflux. The co-
administration of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine enhanced the exposure of everolimus in the brain 
cortex (2.62-fold increase in AUClast), which is consistent with the inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain-
barrier. There was also a rapid uptake of everolimus in CSF, although the exposure of everolimus in 
CSF was less than that in the brain cortex with individual cortex/CSF concentration ratios ranging from 
3.49 to 5.0. Co-administration of cyclosporine did not enhance the exposure of everolimus in the CSF 
in terms of AUClast. Mean concentrations at 0.25, 1, and 4 hours were consistently higher in the 
everolimus plus cyclosporine arm than in the everolimus arm. The similar AUClast between the arms 
was due to the lower mean concentration at the 24 h time point in the everolimus plus cyclosporine 
arm. Results of the study are presented in Tables 1-4.

The MAH did not submit toxicology studies with this application. 
The MAH submitted a review which re-evaluated the adverse treatment-related findings in a juvenile 
rat development study. In this study there were no juvenile animal-specific systemic effects. The 
lenticular findings (also reported in studies in adult rat studies) were considered a species-specific 
response in rats, since they were not observed in any of the other species studied (mice, monkey, 
rabbits, minipigs). Neurological development parameters were assessed. Although there were delays in 
pre-weaning evaluations (i.e., eye opening, testes descent), all criteria were met by the end of the 
assessment periods. Post-weaning evaluations revealed no everolimus-related effects on acoustic 
startle, pupillary reflex, open field motor activity, or passive avoidance tests. 
In males, the results of the water maze evaluation revealed a statistically significant increase in the 
total latency time during the learning phase at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg/day everolimus, and during the 
memory phase at 1.5 mg/kg/day everolimus relative to the concurrent controls. There were no effects 
in females in the water maze evaluation, and no alterations in males or females in the passive 
avoidance test. There was absence of effects on reflex evaluations during the dosing period and the 
absence of microscopic changes in the brain. 
The potential effects of everolimus on brain development were also assessed in the pre- and post-natal 
development (PPND) study in rats, the results of which indicated that fetal exposure during in utero 
development and pup exposure via nursing did not result in effects on reflex or learning/memory 
evaluations. The expression of P-gP in rat brain is age-dependent: it is undetectable in the embryo and

newborn rat brain, became detectable at Day 7 postpartum, gradually increased and reached a plateau 
at postpartum Day 284. In contrast, the expression of P-gP is detectable at early stage of development 
for human fetal brain (8- to 12-weeks of gestation), and with increasing intensity during fetal 
development5, 6. The expression of MDR1 (the gene for P-gP) in human fetal brain at 21 weeks of 
gestation appeared to be similar to that of adult brain7. Therefore, it is expected, that elimination of 
everolimus from the brain of a human child would be more efficient than from a juvenile rat brain. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was based on the prevalence of the 
entire TCS- SEGA population including all age ranges in the procedures Votubia EMEA/H/C/2311 and 
Votubia EMEA/H/C/2311/II/04 resulting in a PEC clearly below the action limit of 0.01µg/L for a Phase 
II environmental risk assessment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support this application, the MAH provided an overview of the known pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology of everolimus supplemented by one additional pharmacokinetic study 
investigating the brain distribution of everolimus in rats after oral administration of 3 mg/kg 
everolimus with and without oral co-administration of 10 mg/kg cyclosporine.  
The time profile of the blood and brain concentrations of everolimus demonstrated a rapid uptake of 
the test compound in the brain followed by a slow efflux. The mean peak concentration of everolimus 
in the brain cortex occurred at the last sampling time point of 24 h. The co-administration of the P-gp 
inhibitor cyclosporine enhanced the exposure of everolimus in the brain cortex (2.62-fold increase in 
AUClast), which is consistent with the inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain-barrier. 
There was also a rapid uptake of everolimus in CSF, although the exposure of everolimus in CSF was 
less than that in the brain cortex with individual cortex/CSF concentration ratios ranging from 3.49 to 
5.0. Co-administration of cyclosporine did not enhance the exposure of everolimus in the CSF in terms 
of AUClast. It should be noted that mean concentrations at 0.25, 1, and 4 hours were consistently 
higher in the everolimus plus cyclosporine arm than in the everolimus arm. The similar AUClast between

the arms was due to the lower mean concentration at the 24 h time point in the everolimus plus 
cyclosporine arm.  
The therapeutic relevance of the findings on blood-brain passage was considered relevant for the 
intended expansion of the indication to children < 3 years of age. There was uncertainty as to whether 
the BBB was fully developed at birth and if the distribution of everolimus into the brain of patients 
younger than three years of age compared to that of older patients. The MAH submitted a discussion 
on the development of the BBB. Extrapolating from the non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
studies into humans, there is the presumption that everolimus may also penetrate the BBB in humans 
and the response of SEGA lesions in the clinical Study M2301 may be derived from the effect of 
everolimus. Thus, given that the main efflux mechanism of everolimus from the brain is via PgP 
transportation and that this mechanism develops in-utero in humans and post-partum in rats, 
extrapolation of exposure to everolimus in the juvenile rats to children age < 3 years was accepted. In 
addition, the MAH presented an adequate discussion to the extrapolation of exposure data from the 
juvenile toxicology studies to the paediatric population. Although there were delays in pre-weaning 
evaluations (i.e., eye opening, testes descent), all criteria were met by the end of the assessment 
periods. Post-weaning evaluations revealed no everolimus-related effects on acoustic startle, pupillary 
reflex, open field motor activity, or passive avoidance tests. The effects of everolimus in TSC animal 
models reported in the published literature indicate no evidence of adverse effects on brain 
development in juvenile animals. 
As requested by the CHMP, the following information was added in section 5.2 of the SmPC concerning 
everolimus distribution across the BBB: 
“Nonclinical studies in rats indicate: 
• 
• 
A rapid uptake of everolimus in the brain followed by a slow efflux. 
The radioactive metabolites of [3H]everolimus do not significantly cross the blood-brain 
barrier. 
• 
• 
A dose-dependent brain penetration of everolimus, which is consistent with the hypothesis of 
saturation of an efflux pump present in the brain capillary endothelial cells. 
The co-administration of the PgP inhibitor, cyclosporine, enhances the exposure of everolimus 
in the brain cortex, which is consistent with the inhibition of PgP at the blood-brain barrier. 
There are no clinical data on the distribution of everolimus in the human brain. Non-clinical studies in 
rats demonstrated distribution into the brain following administration by both the intravenous and oral 
routes.” 
An acceptable explanation for not providing an updated ERA was submitted. Everolimus PEC 
surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does 
not exceed 4.5. Thus, everolimus is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
All the concerns over the distribution of everolimus in the brain as well as neurotoxicity in the 
developing brain have been addressed.  The study results of the brain distribution of everolimus with 
or without the co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor in the rat provided evidence of the passage of 
everolimus and/or its metabolites into the brain cortex and CSF in a dose-dependent manner. In 
addition, the results of the juvenile toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, safety pharmacology studies 
and the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, as well as the effects of everolimus in TSC 
animal models reported in the published literature indicate no evidence of permanent adverse effects 
on brain development. The overall conclusion that the non-clinical studies do not indicate any 
Votubia 
Assessment report

permanent adverse effects on brain development was accepted.  These results supported the extension 
of the indication of everolimus in the treatment of SRGA patients to children < 3 years of age.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The new biopharmaceutic information of everolimus in humans comprised results of bioequivalence 
Study X2105 which compared the 5 mg dispersible tablet to the 1 mg tablet used in Study M2301 and 
the results of bioequivalence Study X2106 which compared the 5 mg dispersible tablet to the 5 mg 
tablet used in Study C2485.

•  Bioavailability 
Study X2105 
Study X2105 was a single centre, randomized, open-label, crossover study with two treatment periods 
and two possible treatment sequences. Fifty-four healthy eligible subjects (female or male subjects 
aged 18 to 55 years in good health condition) were enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the 
Votubia 
Assessment report

two treatment sequences. Sequence 1-everolimus 1×5-mg dispersible tablet (test) and Sequence 2-
everolimus 5×1-mg MF (marketed formulation) tablets (reference). In each treatment sequence the 
two treatment periods were preceded by baseline assessments (up to 24 h prior to study drug 
administration) followed by a single-dose treatment and 144 h of follow-up for pharmacokinetic (PK) 
samples. 
Study subjects remained in the clinical pharmacology unit (CPU) for the first 72 h after study drug 
administration. Thereafter, subjects were released from the CPU and had three additional visits during 
the first and second treatment periods at 96 h (Day 5 and Day 19, respectively), 120 h (Day 6 and 
Day 20, respectively) and 144 h (Day 7 and Day 21, respectively) post-dose for collection of PK 
samples. The end of study (EOS) evaluation was done 14 (± 2) days after the study drug 
administration in the second treatment period. The two treatment periods were separated by an out-
patient period of 8 days for thorough washout of the investigational product (the second drug 
administration was to be 14 days following the previous one). 
Primary objective of study X2105 was to demonstrate bioequivalence between the 1 × 5-mg 
dispersible tablet and the 5 × 1-mg MF tablets used in the phase III SEGA study M2301. Secondary 
objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability of a single dose of 5x1-mg dispersible tablets and a 
single 5-mg MF of everolimus. 
Primary endpoints for bioequivalence analysis were AUC(0-144h), AUC(0-inf), and C max of everolimus. 
Secondary PK variables were Tmax, T1/2, λz, CL/F, BSA-normalized CL/F and Vd/F. 
Most subjects had non-quantifiable concentration values at 144 h post-dose. Therefore, sample size 
was small for the PK parameter AUC0-144h i.e. only 6 subjects with quantifiable concentrations at 144 h 
(C144h) in each treatment arm, and only 4 subjects with quantifiable concentrations at 144 h in both 
treatment arms.

Geometric mean ratio (test/reference) and 90% confidence intervals for 
primary everolimus PK parameters – Study C2121 
Since the t last for most subjects (of study X2105) was actually 72 h or 96 h, and rarely 144 h, it led to 
the exclusion of the primary PK parameter AUC0-144h for all but 4 subjects. Additional exploratory 
analyses on AUC0-72h and AUC0-96h were conducted. 
Geometric mean ratio of the test to reference formulation, for the exploratory PK parameters AUC0-72h 
and AUC0-96h was 0.86 and 0.89 respectively. The 90% CIs for AUC0-72h and AUC0-96h were 0.8004-
0.9290 and 0.8241-0.9661 respectively, and were completely within the bioequivalence interval for the 
boundaries of (0.8, 1.25). 
For the secondary parameters, T1/2, CL/F, BSA normalized CL/F, λz, Vd/F and MRT, the geometric 
mean ratios of test to reference formulations and the 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric means were

Study X2106 
Study X2106 was a single centre, randomized, open-label, crossover study with two treatment periods 
and two possible treatment sequences. Fifty-four (54) healthy subjects were enrolled and randomized 
to one of the two treatment sequences. Sequence 1-everolimus 1×5-mg dispersible tablet (test) and 
1×5-mg Final Market Image (FMI) tablet (reference); Sequence 2-everolimus 1×5-mg FMI tablet 
(reference) and everolimus 1×5-mg dispersible tablet (test). 
In each sequence the two treatment periods were preceded by baseline assessments (up to 24 h prior 
to study drug administration) followed by a single-dose treatment and 144 h of follow-up for PK 
samples. 
Primary objective of study X2106 was to demonstrate bioequivalence between the 1 × 5-mg 
dispersible tablet and the 1 × 5-mg FMI tablets. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of a single dose of a single 5-mg dispersible a single 5-mg FMI tablet of everolimus. 
Primary endpoints for bioequivalence analysis were AUC(0-144h), AUC(0-inf), and C max of everolimus. 
Secondary PK variables were Tmax, T1/2, λz, CL/F, BSA-normalized CL/F and Vd/F. Additional secondary 
PK variables were: AUC(0-72h), AUC(0-96h), and AUC(0-tlast). 
Comparable to study X2105, most subjects had non-quantifiable concentration values at 144 h post-
dose. There were only 6 subjects with quantifiable concentration at 144 h in the 1×5 mg FMI 
formulation arm and 4 subjects with quantifiable concentration at 144 h in the 1×5 mg dispersible 
formulation arm. There was only a single subject with valid AUC(0-144h) for both formulations.

Summary of statistical analysis of everolimus primary PK parameters (PK set) 
– Study X2106 
For the primary parameter AUC(0-inf), ratio of geometric means of the test to the reference formulation 
was 0.91, with a 90% CI lower bound of 0.862 and an upper bound of 0.955, thus lying entirely within 
the interval for the boundaries of (0.8, 1.25), and meeting the criteria for BE. AUC(0-144h), geometric 
mean ratio (test: reference) could not be derived due to lack of data. The geometric mean ratio (test: 
reference) for Cmax was 0.80, with a 90% CI of 0.754-0.859, thus lying outside the (0.8, 1.25) 
boundaries for BE. 
Geometric mean ratio of the test to reference formulation, for the exploratory PK parameters AUC(0-
tlast), AUC(0-72h) and AUC(0-96h) was 0.90, 0.90 and 0.91 respectively. The 90% CIs for AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-
72h) and AUC(0-96h) were 0.848-0.945, 0.854-0.946 and 0.856-0.958 respectively, and were completely 
within the bioequivalence interval for the boundaries of (0.8, 1.25).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Study X2111 
Study X2111 was a single center, open-label, randomised two-way cross-over study investigating the 
bioequivalence of everolimus (RAD001) 2 × 5-mg dispersible tablets in suspension and 5 × 2- mg 
dispersible tablets in suspension, in healthy male subjects. The primary objective of study X2111 was 
to compare the rate and extent of absorption between 2 × 5 -mg dispersible tablets in suspension and 
5 × 2 -mg dispersible tablets in suspension measured by AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax following a single 
dose of everolimus. 
This study enrolled 24 healthy adult (age range 25-54 years) volunteers. Each subject was to be 
treated with both treatment sequences after pre-defined washout periods. Twenty-three of the 24 
patients completed both treatment sequences. One patient did not complete the study due to use of 
prohibited concomitant medication in between treatment sequences. 
The geometric mean ratios for the primary PK parameters and 90% CI comparing the 5 × 2 -mg 
dispersible tablets in suspension (test) and 2 × 5 -mg dispersible tablets in suspension (reference) 
were as follows: 
AUCinf: 0.97 (0.89 to 1.06) (N=23 subjects) 
AUClast: 0.97 (0.88 to 1.06) (N=23 subjects) 
Cmax: 0.96 (0.87 to 1.07) (N=23 subjects)

Special populations 
Population PK and PK/PD model 
A population PK report and a report describing a PK/PD model for everolimus in patients with TSC who 
have SEGA were submitted. 
The model used data from only the double blinded treatment phase of study M2301 up to the 02 March 
2011 cut-off date. NONMEM with METHOD=1 INTERACTION was used for modelling. The NONMEM 
objective function values and diagnostic plots were used to assess goodness of fit, to suggest 
covariates to add to the model, and to evaluate the model. Covariates age, BSA, BMI, baseline SEGA 
volume, sex, and concomitant medications were also examined graphically for trends and their 
reduction of variability by plotting individual estimates versus the covariates. A visual predictive check 
was also used as part of the model evaluation. The recommended starting dose for the SEGA indication 
was 4.5 mg/m2 using either the dispersible tablets or the regular tablets. Simulations of steady-state 
Cmin were conducted separately based on the recommended starting dose rounded to feasible mg 
doses for both the regular and dispersible tablets to assess the relative frequency of Cmin’s within and 
outside of the newly proposed target range of 3-15 ng/mL. 
Seventy-eight patients ranging from 1.0 to 23.9 years and 0.4 m2 to 2.2 m2 body surface area 
contributed 810 everolimus blood concentrations to the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The 
samples were generally a trough and a peak sample collected from the patient on the same day. A one 
compartment model adequately characterized the data. Due to the limited sampling the absorption 
rate constant was set to 6.07 h-1 for all patients. 
The initial modelling to explain variability identified body surface area and presence of CYP3A or PgP 
enzyme inducers as significant covariates. The individual estimates of oral clearance and volume from 
the best of these models were examined closely at the lowest BSA. The population oral clearance was

higher than the corresponding individual estimates of oral clearance suggesting some lack of fit of the 
population model (top panel of Figure 1). For the final model, piecewise differentiable functions 
(smooth splines) for oral clearance and oral volume were selected to provide less bias, especially for 
individual oral clearance at the lowest BSA. For the final model (bottom panel of Figure 1), the 
estimates of clearance and volume were lower at the data limits than the initial models so as to infer 
slightly lower (potentially safer) doses when extrapolated compared to the initial models (based on 
BSA normalised clearance, bottom panel of Figure 2).

In the final model, at BSA ≤ 0.542 m2 the estimates of typical normalized oral clearance and 
normalized oral volume were 18.9 L/h/m2 and 310 L/m2, respectively, and at BSA ≥1.542 m2 the 
estimates of typical unnormalized oral clearance and unnormalized oral volume were 19.7 L/h and 
323L. With the presence of CYP3A or PgP enzyme inducers, the corresponding apparent clearances 
(L/h) and normalized clearances (L/h/m2) increased by 23%.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Evaluation of biomarkers were assessed in plasma samples collected during the conduct of study 
M2301 at screening, week 4, week 12, every 12 weeks until week 48 and at the end of treatment visit. 
Analyses were performed using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology as 
well as by multiplexed MSD platform formatted as 4plex and 2plex combinations, following validation 
of the assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications. 
The following biomarkers related to the angiogenesis pathway were analyzed: VEGF, VEGFD, soluble 
VEGF receptor 1 (sVEGFR1), soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR2), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 
placental growth factor (PLGF), c-Kit and collagen type IV. 
Figure 4 below shows longitudinal plots of 3 selected biomarkers (VEGF, soluble VEGFR-2, and collagen 
type 4).

Approximately 20% decrease in sVEGFR2 and collagen type IV and an initial and sustained increase in 
VEGF levels in everolimus-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients with TSC who have 
SEGA has been observed. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Results of the pharmacology studies show that dissolution of intact tablets (both non-dispersible and 
dispersible) in water affects PK behaviour of the substance: Cmax is significantly lower than after 
swallowing intact tablets although AUC does not seem to be affected. These results show that intact 
standard tablets and dispersible tablets cannot be used interchangeably. A statement has been 
included in the SmPC in section 4.2 on the interchangeability of the pharmaceutical forms. The lower 
Cmax is considered to be the result of incomplete swallowing of the solution. Taken the small difference 
Votubia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/39285/2014 
Page 30/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the AUCs into consideration, the dispersible tablets can be used in patients who cannot swallow 
intact tablets (such as e.g. suckling babies) provided that ctrough is monitored as recommended in the 
SmPC. 
The MAH submitted a study demonstrating bioequivalence between the 5 mg and 2 mg dispersible 
formulations and received a biowaiver for the 3 mg tablet.  
Dosing based on Body Surface Area was justified by the reduced variability in drug clearance when 
normalised for BSA compared to the variability observed when normalised for weight. A new section on 
dosing based on BSA using the Dubois formula was introduced in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Simulations 
based on the population pharmacokinetic model indicated that the presence of inducers increased both 
apparent and BSA-normalised clearance by 23%. Furthermore, in the presence of inducers the 
percentage of patients with a steady state Cmin less that 3 ng/mL was 44.4% as compared to 14.3% in 
the non-induced population.  
The MAH provided data on biomarkers related to the angiogenesis. The analysis showed an increase in 
VEGF and collagen type IV expression and a decrease in VEGFR2 expression in plasma of patients 
treated with everolimus compared to placebo treated patients. The data on the levels of VEGF was 
included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The MAH proposed a new starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2. The results from population PK and PK/PD 
modelling study showed that 4.5 mg/m2 starting dose appears acceptable across the age range. In 
addition, the actual starting dose of the pivotal study M2301 was also 4.5 mg/m2 whereas study C2485 
used a starting dose of 3.0 mg/m2/day. The increase to 4.5 mg/m2/day in study M2301 was initiated in 
order to enable patients to reach the target trough concentration earlier and on the observation that 
the maximum tolerated dose in paediatric patients8 was 5.0 mg/m2. The majority of the questions 
around the reliability of the population PK model have been sufficiently resolved to endorse the model-
based justifications of the starting dose until further data and analyses are available. Thus, the new 
starting dose is justified. 
The MAH proposed to widen the trough target range from 5-15 ng/ml to 3-15 ng/ml. This proposal was 
withdrawn by the MAH during the procedure.  
The MAH applied for a change in the indication to “Votubia is indicated for the treatment of patients 
with SEGA associated with TSC who require therapeutic intervention and who are not likely to require 
surgery”. The MAH submitted a discussion on the need to treat patients with demonstrated SEGA 
growth (as measured by volume increase) regardless of the size of the lesions. Since SEGA lesions can 
develop by the age of below one, the MAH proposed to also include the paediatric patient population as 
they that may also require therapeutic intervention early in the disease. The CHMP had concerns over 
reports of SEGA regrowth following treatment withdrawal and the potential for complications following 
rapid re-bound growth and lesion progression or haemorrhage due to size fluctuation. The main 
concern was that this could lead to a lost opportunity for an early potentially curative neurosurgical 
resection. The MAH responded that they did not have clinical trial experience with the use of 
everolimus for the purpose of SEGA reduction with the intent of performing tumour resection. In the 
absence of such data, the MAH withdrew the proposal during the procedure.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The updated data submitted for studies C2485 and M2301 confirms the previous data submitted at the 
time of the marketing authorisation, that there was a statistically significant correlation between Cmin 
and absolute SEGA volume reduction and between Cmin and percentage SEGA volume reduction. 
The population pharmacokinetic model supports the starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2. 
The plasma angiogenesis markers did not have either prognostic or predictive values. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
•  Additional data and analyses are planned to be submitted in September 2013. These will 
comprise 1) a subset of 20 or more patients to have PK profiles with less sparse data, 2) longer 
follow-up PK data through 3.5 years, and 3) up to 39 additional patients – those randomized to 
placebo who switched to everolimus. This should improve understanding and the accuracy and 
precision of estimates of clearance and of the effects of BSA and Cytochrome p450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and PgP inducers on clearance. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Main study 
Study M2301: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of RAD001 in the 
treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) associated with 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 
Methods 
Trial M2301 is an ongoing, prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
multi-centre phase III trial evaluating treatment with everolimus versus placebo in patients with TSC-
associated SEGA.  
The trial was separated by 3 treatment phases as follows: 
•  Core treatment phase: the period lasting from randomization of the first patient until the last 
randomized patient was treated with everolimus or placebo for 6 months. The core treatment 
phase was divided into the following: 
o  Double-blind treatment period. 
o  Open-label period in which patients who had been receiving placebo and experienced a 
SEGA progression (as per central review or unequivocal progression according to 
investigator assessment) during the blinded treatment phase were offered open-label 
everolimus. 
•  Extension phase: if superiority of everolimus was shown during the core treatment phase, an 
extension phase was to be launched. 
•  A follow-up period, in which all patients were to have a follow-up visit scheduled 28 days 
after the last dose of study treatment to assess adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) that could have occurred after discontinuation from study treatment, was also 
conducted for both core and extension phases.

Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria selected for patients, irrespective of age, was patients with TSC associated SEGA 
and radiological evidence of at least one of the following three conditions prior to randomisation: (1) 
serial SEGA growth; (2) presence of a new SEGA lesion; (3) new or worsening hydrocephalus. Relevant 
exclusion criterion was patients for whom SEGA related surgery was likely to be required as per the 
opinion of the investigator. 
Treatments 
The study protocol required the titration of everolimus from an initial starting dose of 4.5 mg/m2/day, 
subject to tolerability, with the objective of attaining trough concentrations in the 5-15 ng/mL range. 
Regular trough monitoring was to be performed throughout the study. Trough (pre-dose) blood levels 
of everolimus were assessed after 2 weeks of initial treatment, at each clinic visit, and 1-2 weeks after 
starting an increased dose at a new level, or any decrease in an enzyme-inducing drug, or any 
increase in an enzyme-inhibiting agent. Treatment duration was not specified and continued until SEGA 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. The core treatment phase corresponded to the period between 
the randomisation of the first patient and the last randomised patient completing 6 months of 
treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare SEGA response rate on everolimus versus placebo 
in patients with TSC-associated SEGA irrespective of age. 
Key secondary study objectives were to compare everolimus vs. placebo in a pre-defined sequence 
with respect to: 
1. Change from baseline in frequency of epileptiform events 
2. Time to SEGA progression 
3. Skin lesion response rate 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SEGA response rate (as determined by independent central 
radiology review). SEGA response was defined as: (1) a ≥ 50% reduction in SEGA volume relative to 
baseline (where SEGA volume was the sum of all target SEGA lesion volumes identified at baseline); 
and (2) no unequivocal worsening of non-target SEGA lesions, no new SEGA lesions (≥ 1 cm in longest 
diameter), and no new or worsening hydrocephalus.  
Key secondary efficacy endpoints included: absolute change in total seizure frequency per 24 hours 
from baseline to Week 24, time to SEGA progression (TTSP), and skin lesion response rate. 
Safety endpoints were rate, type, severity, and causal relationship of AEs and SAEs to treatment. 
Safety and tolerability were assessed according to NCI CTCAE criteria. 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 99 patients.

Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with either everolimus or placebo. 
Randomisation was stratified by the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs).  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was designed as a double-blind study. The extension and follow up phase of the study was 
open label.

Conduct of the study 
Of 117 individuals enrolled in the trial, 78 were randomised to treatment with everolimus and 39 to 
treatment with placebo between 20 August 2009 and 02 Sepember 2010. A total of 5 patients 
randomised to placebo switched to open-label treatment with everolimus and were included in the 
open-label population. The final primary analysis used data up to the cut-off date of 02 March 2011, 
which was 6 months after the last patient was randomised. The database was locked and unblinded on 
05 May 2011. At the end of the core treatment phase and based on the efficacy results, the Study 
Steering Committee (SSC) met on 13 May 2011 and recommended to unblind the study and that all 
patients be offered the opportunity to receive open-label treatment with everolimus. The study is 
currently on-going. Updated results from the 2-year analysis correspond to a cut-off date of 31 
December 2010.

Numbers analysed 
Four patients were excluded from the per-protocol set – two everolimus patients because their best 
SEGA response was ‘not evaluable’, one everolimus patient because of insufficient treatment exposure, 
and one placebo patient who received an incorrect medication packet (though it transpired after un-
blinding that the incorrect packet still contained placebo).

A sensitivity analysis using exact logistic regression gave similar results as did an analysis using 
‘worsening’ instead of ‘progression’ (worsening requires a >25% increase from nadir but without the 
requirement of increasing to a volume greater than baseline – the response rates in this analysis were 
26 (33.3% vs. 0)). 
Table 20:  
Change from baseline of sum of volumes of target SEGA lesions by time 
window – Full Analysis Set 
A higher proportion of patients in the everolimus arm at Weeks 12, 24, and 48 were reported with 
SEGA volume reductions ≥ 30% (73.0%, 78.4%, and 81.3%, respectively) and ≥ 50% (29.7%, 
41.9%, and 43.8%, respectively) than those in the placebo arm (reductions ≥ 30%: 7.7%, 14.7%, 
and 14.3%, respectively; reductions ≥ 50%: 0%, 2.9%, and 0%, respectively). 
All patients in the everolimus arm experienced a reduction in sum of volumes of target SEGA lesions 
relative to baseline in contrast to those on the placebo arm, where 66.7% experienced a reduction. 
Change from baseline in target lesion volume (absolute and percentage change) were tabulated by 
treatment group. The greater decreases were seen on the everolimus group, supporting the primary 
findings. The change from baseline was evident at 12 weeks with a 39% mean percentage decrease at 
week 12 in the everolimus arm as compared to a 3% mean increase in the placebo arm. The effect was 
durable with a 46% mean percentage decrease in the everolimus arm at week 48 as compared to a 
7% mean decrease in the placebo arm. 
Concerning efficacy, Figure 5 below provides relevant information concerning the subgroup of patients 
younger than 3 years of age.

months were 100% for the everolimus arm and 85.7% for placebo (P-value <0.025). However, the p-
value was not statistically significant.

Duration of SEGA response 
No cases of SEGA progression were seen in the everolimus treatment arm. Responses were all ongoing 
and durations ranged from 63+ to 255+ days.

Time to SEGA response 
Twenty-seven SEGA responses were reported in the everolimus treatment arm. The median time to 
SEGA response was 2.99 months coinciding with the time of the first assessment (95% CI: 2.79, 
5.36), with a range from 77 to 179 days. 
Time to SEGA worsening 
The median value was not reached in either treatment arm. SEGA worsening was observed in 7 
patients (9.0%) in the everolimus arm and in 8 (20.5%) in the placebo arm. 
Duration of skin lesion response 
Among the 30 patients with a skin lesion response in the everolimus treatment arm, there were no 
cases of skin lesion progression. Responses were ongoing in all cases and ranged from 70+ to 436+ 
days. 
Interictal epileptiform discharge frequency 
Overall, there was no difference observed in the change in the Awake IED frequency from baseline to 
Week 24 between everolimus-treated patients and those treated with placebo. This was also the case 
for the subset of patients with ≥ 1 Awake IED at baseline (N=62). Similar results were observed for 
Asleep IED frequency. 
Change from baseline in plasma angiogenic markers 
The evaluation of the change from baseline in plasma angiogenic molecules is currently ongoing. 
Angiomyolipoma responses 
Angiomyolipoma responses were observed solely in the everolimus arm (53.3%; 95% CI: 34.3, 71.7).  
Table 23: 
Best overall angiomyolipoma response as per central review (in patients with 
at least one target angiomyolipoma lesion at baseline)– Full Analysis Set  
At Weeks 12, 24, 48, everolimus treatment resulted in greater median reductions by percentage 
change from baseline in the sum of target angiomyolipoma lesions (-52.2%, - 58.9%, and -68.7%, 
respectively) as compared to placebo (5.8%, 8.1%, and 24.0%, respectively). Only everolimus-treated 
patients were reported with angiomyolipoma reductions of ≥ 50% at Weeks 12, 24, and 48 (56.5%, 
78.3%, and 80.0%, respectively), while higher percentages of patients in the everolimus arm were 
observed with angiomyolipoma reductions of ≥ 30% (82.6%, 100%, and 100%, respectively) than in 
those with placebo (8.3%, 18.2%, and 16.7%, respectively). These figures are based on best 
reductions at each time point and did not necessarily meet the criteria for response.

Hydrocephalus volume 
All patients with hydrocephalus at baseline were randomised to the everolimus arm. All experienced a 
decrease in ventricular volume and no patients required surgical intervention for growing SEGA during 
the course of the study. 
Ancillary analyses 
•  Analysis of efficacy - open-label period for study M2301 
In the open-label period, 2 of the 5 patients who were initially treated with placebo and subsequently 
crossed over to the everolimus arm reported a SEGA response. The durations of response for these 
patients were 182+ days and 114+ days, respectively. Durations of therapy were 377 days and 204 
days, respectively; prior to SEGA response, these patients received everolimus therapy for 161 days 
and 85 days, respectively. Both patients were female, < 10 years of age, and were not treated with 
EIAEDs. The remaining 3 patients were reported with stable disease, but all presented with a ≥ 40% 
reduction from baseline. 
None of the patients were observed with new or worsening hydrocephalus, ventricular configuration 
changes/cap signs, or changes in CSF flow dynamics during the open-label period. None of the patients 
entering the open-label phase had either a target angiomyolipoma lesion or SEN lesion at baseline. 
Supportive study 
The MAH submitted a two years report on trial C2485 (data cut-off date 02 March 2011) as part of the 
renewal of Votubia. Twenty-eight patients with TSC who had SEGA were screened and subsequently 
enrolled between 07 January 2007 and 18 December2008. As of the 31 December 2010 data cut-off 
date, 25 out of 28 patients are ongoing in this study (same number of patients as the previous cut-
off); all these 25 patients have ≥ 2 years of exposure. 
Primary endpoint: reduction in primary SEGA volume 
Results from longer-term follow-up demonstrated that the positive effect on tumour burden was 
maintained with a median reduction in primary SEGA volume at Month 24 of 0.71 cm3 (range: -0.55 to

At month 24, 50% of patients were still maintaining a >50% reduction in SEGA volume (n=24), whilst 
at month 36 this was 55.6% although fewer patients contributed to the 36 month data (n=9). 
An updated 3-year analysis was presented for study C2485 in the context of the 2nd annual 
reassessment/renewal. Twenty-eight patients with TSC who had SEGA were screened and 
subsequently enrolled between 07 January 2007 and 18 December 2008. As of the 14 December 2011 
data cut-off date, 24 out of 28 patients are ongoing in this study (one patient less as compared to the 
previous cut-off); all these 24 patients have ≥ 3 years of exposure.  
The 2 years report does not provide new insights in most of the secondary endpoints (such as Seizure 
frequency, Quality of life, Neuropsychometric functioning etc.), except for the following:

Duration of response 
Of the 25 patients with a ≥ 30% reduction in primary SEGA volume, two patients met the definition for 
progression (i.e., an increase from nadir of ≥ 25% to a value greater than baseline) at any later time 
point. The median time from first response to progression/censoring was 23.79 months (range: >0.0 
to 39.4). 
Response of facial angiofibromas 
Responses of facial angiofibromas continue to show improvement with time. At Month 18, 7 of 9 
patients showed improvement which rises to 8 of 9 patients at Month 24, and 9 of 9 patients at Month 
30. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data was reviewed during the renewal procedure for Votubia. The MAH re-submitted two 
study reports from the renewal procedure, the updated 2 and 3–year analysis for the uncontrolled trial 
C2485 and the study report for the double bind placebo-controlled trial M2301. 
M2301 has now transitioned from the placebo-controlled double-blind sequence to open–label where 
patients with evidence of progression were able to cross over from placebo arm to the everolimus arm. 
Data on best overall response rate from the double-blind sequence of the trial was available for up to 
48 weeks in some patients, although the median duration of treatment was 45 weeks on everolimus 
and 41 weeks on placebo. 
In study M2301, a reduction in SEGA volume from baseline of >50% was defined as a response. Using 
this definition, the best overall response rate on everolimus was 34.6% (95% CI 24.2-46.2%) as 
compared to 0 (95% CI 0-9%) on placebo (p<0.0001). The reduction in SEGA volume was evident by 
week 12 and was durable. The mean percentage decrease in SEGA volume from baseline was 39% at 
week 12 in the everolimus arm as compared to a 3% mean increase in the placebo arm.  A 46% mean 
percentage decrease in the everolimus arm was observed at week 48 as compared to a 7% mean 
decrease in the placebo arm. In addition, in patients with hydrocephalus at baseline, a reduction in 
ventricular volume was also observed. Consistency of effect was demonstrated across all subgroups, 
irrespective of use of enzyme-inducers, age or gender. 
6 patients in the placebo arm discontinued treatment due to disease progression. All 6 were offered 
open-label everolimus. Of these, 2 patients experienced a SEGA response, whilst 3 experienced stable 
disease. All presented with >40% reduction from baseline in SEGA volume. One patient only started 
everolimus one day prior to the data cut-off date and therefore data was not included.  
A key secondary endpoint was change from baseline to week 24 in total seizure frequency.  This 
analysis was not statistically significant between the two treatment groups (p=0.2004). However, as 
most patients did not have any seizures at baseline, the analysis is not particularly meaningful. A 
further sensitivity analysis restricted to patients with seizures at baseline was also inconclusive as 
there was an imbalance in the baseline seizure frequency with a higher frequency in the placebo arm 
versus everolimus (median 11 versus 5.5).   
The other two key secondary endpoints were TTSP and worsening of skin lesions. Both demonstrated a 
statistically significant difference from placebo (p=0.0002 and p=0.0004, respectively), however, the 
data could not be formally declared as significant due to the pre-defined testing hierarchy and the 
failure of the seizure frequency endpoint.  
Votubia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/39285/2014 
Page 49/76 
 
 
 
 
Effects of everolimus as compared to placebo were also noted for the angiomyolipoma lesions (AML) in 
SEGA patients. The best overall response rate (for percentage reductions of >50%) was 53.3% as 
compared to 0 on placebo.  
The updated 2–year as well as the available 3–year analysis from Study C2485, confirms that the 
SEGA response in patients is long-lasting in patients on treatment, with a durable response of >50% 
reduction from baseline observed in 34.6% at month 12, 50% at month 24 and 55.6% at month 36 as 
per independent radiology review. Whilst two patients met the criteria for progression, the investigator 
did not discontinue treatment as patients were obtaining ongoing symptomatic clinical benefit. 
Subsequent radiographic evaluations revealed stabilisation or shrinkage of the tumour in these two 
patients. 
Study C2485 also described a durable improvement in facial angiofibroma lesions with 7 out of 9 
patients showing improvement at month 18. This rose to 9 out of 9 patients at month 30. 
There were 13 SEGA patients in the subgroup < 3 years treated with everolimus in the M2301 study. 
These patients were successfully treated and SEGA response in favour of everolimus was observed in 
patients < 3 years of age treated with everolimus compared to placebo (difference in response rate 
23.08; 90% CI: -24.07 – 63.04). Thus, these results justify the elimination of the age limit “aged 3 
years and older” from the current indication.   
The analysis of reduction in seizure frequency at 24 weeks, which was a key secondary endpoint in 
study M2301, did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between everolimus and 
placebo.  
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP addressed the following questions to the PDCO: 
1. Does the PDCO consider that there is a clear need for everolimus treatment in patients less than 3 
years old who require therapeutic intervention, for whom neurosurgery is not an option? 
2. What would be the clinical relevance of everolimus treatment in patients less than 3 years old if 
most patients in this age group do not require interventional treatment, or would be amenable to 
neurosurgery? 
On February 08, 2013, the PDCO issued the following opinion: 
1. The PDCO considers that there is a clear need for everolimus treatment in patients less than 3 years 
old who require therapeutic intervention, for whom neurosurgery is not an option. 
2. Everolimus treatment in patients less than 3 years old could be of clinical relevance. 
In addition to adopting the above answers, the PDCO noted the safety concerns with respect to a use 
in children younger than 3 years of age, according to the CHMP assessment of the results of the clinical 
and non-clinical studies. 
The PDCO recently agreed on further paediatric trials with everolimus, targeting to treat paediatric 
patients with refractory partial-onset seizures (POS) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) complex. 
For these, a separate PIP (EMEA-000019-PIP08-12) had to be agreed. Preliminary clinical data 
indicated that everolimus may reduce seizure frequency in TSC patients with refractory epilepsy (POS). 
This may allow concurrent AEDs to be reduced or discontinued, which the PDCO considers a relevant 
clinical benefit. This was the background for the proposal by the applicant and for the PDCO for studies 
of everolimus in children with infantile spasms as young as from 1 month of age onwards. 
Votubia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/39285/2014 
Page 50/76 
 
 
 
 
During the discussion of this development, the PDCO and its non-clinical expert group considered that 
non-clinical studies in various species did not suggest toxicity of concern for this age group so that 
juvenile toxicity studies were not requested. 
The CHMP assessment considers that findings of delayed developmental landmarks in juvenile rats and 
the disruption of cortical lens fibers are of concern. 
The PDCO shares the concern and there may be a need for further data. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The updated 2 and 3–year results from study C2485 and the results from the double blind sequence of 
study M2301 confirm that treatment with everolimus reduces the volume of SEGA lesions to <50% 
from baseline and that this response is durable. In study M2301, the best overall response rate was 
34.6% on everolimus as compared to 0% on placebo (p<0.0001). These results support the 
conclusions of the original analysis and demonstrate sustained benefit in SEGA patients. In addition, 
data on the patient subgroup < 3 years treated with everolimus showed a marked difference in SEGA 
response rate in favour of everolimus as compared to placebo. Thus, the elimination of the age limit 
“aged 3 years and older” from the current indication was accepted. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, exposure to everolimus was considered appropriate to allow an assessment of safety in a 
population representative of patients with TSC who have SEGA. In Study M2301, the median duration 
of therapy with everolimus was 9.6 months (range: 5.5 to 18.1) with 50 patients (64.1%) exposed to 
everolimus for a period of ≥ 8.3 months; while the median study follow-up was 9.7 months. Total 
exposure amounted to 66.5 patient-years with everolimus versus 30.8 patient-years for those who 
received placebo. The median dose intensity for patients in the everolimus arm was 5.9 mg/m2/day 
(range: 2.3 to 11.8). 
In study C2485 the median duration of therapy with everolimus was 34.2 months (range: 4.7 to 47.1). 
Total exposure amounted to 75.6 patient-years. In total, 25 (89.3%) patients were exposed to 
everolimus for ≥ 2 years. The median dose intensity was 5.3 mg/m2/day (range: 2.1 to 12.3).

Adverse events  
Common AEs by system organ class in Study M2301 
Overall, AEs were experienced by 96.2% of patients in the everolimus arm and 89.7% in the placebo 
arm. System organ classes (SOCs) where a higher proportion of everolimus-treated patients reported 
events (and where there was a ≥ 10% difference relative to placebo) included: Gastrointestinal 
disorders (+26.9%; primarily mouth ulceration and stomatitis), Skin and subcutaneous disorders 
(+23.1%; including rash and acne), Psychiatric disorders (+20.5%; including aggression, insomnia 
and agitation), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (+16.7%; including pain in extremity), 
General disorders and administration site conditions (+10.2%; including pyrexia and fatigue).

Detailed discussion of clinically notable events 
1.  Infections 
The frequencies of infections were similar between the two treatment arms. Most of the infections 
observed were grade 1-2 in intensity and involved the upper respiratory tract. Pneumonia was seen in

a modest proportion of everolimus-treated patients (7.7%). There were no reported cases of 
opportunistic infections in the everolimus arm. Dose interruption or adjustment was required in a 
number of cases (Table 29). 
Table 29: 
Clinical impact of infections – Safety Set (Study M2301) 
2.  Stomatitis/rashes 
In M2301, most cases of stomatitis were grade–1/2 in severity. Mouth ulcers were more common than 
in the placebo arm (59% versus 25.6%). Seven patients had grade–3 events versus one in the placebo 
arm. No patient discontinued due to stomatitis and no grade–4 events were experienced. Dose 
adjustment or interruption was required in 24.4% versus one patient in the placebo arm. In C2485 
stomatitis was reported in 85.7% of patients. There were 2 grade–3 events of stomatitis in C2485. 
Dose reduction/interruption was implemented for 6 patients (21.4%).  No patient discontinued due to 
stomatitis in C2485. Rashes were grade–1/2 in severity for both studies M2301 and C2485. 
3.  Cytopaenias 
In study M2301, the majority of AEs in this grouping were related to neutropenia or decreased 
neutrophil count, with lymphopenia observed in only one everolimus-treated patient. Cytopenias were 
seen in 15.4% of everolimus-treated patients (including 5.1% of grade–3 severity), and were reported 
more frequently than in placebo-treated patients (2.6%). No grade–4 neutropenia or decreased 
neutrophil count was observed. Dose interruption or adjustment was required in 4 everolimus-treated 
patients (5.1%). No patients discontinued study drug as a result of cytopenias.

In study C2485, cytopenias were seen in 5 patients (17.9%), with decreased neutrophil count reported 
in 4 patients (14.3%). Two patients (7.1%) had grade 3 decreased neutrophil count. No grade–4 
cytopenia was reported. Dose interruption or adjustment was required in 3 patients (10.7%). No 
patients discontinued study drug as a result of cytopenias.

4.  Haemorrhages 
In study M2301, haemorrhage of grade 1-2 intensity was seen in 9.0% of everolimus-treated patients, 
mostly manifesting as epistaxis, but with single reports of blood urine, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and 
hematoma at the vessel puncture site. This incidence was slightly higher than that observed in the 
placebo arm (5.1%). Only one patient in each group had an event suspected to be drug related: 
epistaxis (grade-1) in the everolimus arm and gingival bleeding (grade-1) in the placebo arm. No 
patient required dose interruption/reduction as a result of haemorrhage.

manifesting as epistaxis, haematuria, and injection site hematoma, with single reports of haemoptysis, 
metrorrhagia, and petechiae. None of these events were suspected to be study drug related with the 
exception of one case of haematuria. One patient with petechiae required dose interruption/reduction. 
No patient discontinued study drug as a result of haemorrhage.

5.  Amenorrhea 
Table 34: 
Grading (severity) of amenorrhea by preferred term irrespective of 
relationship to treatment (Safety Set) – Study M2301 
All three cases were medically assessed as secondary amenorrhea, as patients had normal menses 
prior to study entry, and no prior reported medical history of amenorrhea. Post-database lock follow-up 
information indicates that all three of the above cases resolved subsequently. As of 19 December 
2011, none of these cases of amenorrhea were ongoing, while treatment with everolimus was ongoing 
in all 3 patients. No events of amenorrhea and related events were reported during Study C2485.

6.  Renal 
In Study M2301, one AE of renal impairment was reported in the everolimus treatment arm. This event 
was of grade-1 severity and was not suspected to be related to everolimus.  Three cases of grade 1-2 
elevated serum creatinine were recorded as laboratory abnormalities however only one of these events 
was reported as an AE. 
In study C2485, two patients developed proteinuria which was suspected to be drug related during the 
study. One event was grade-1 and the other was grade-2. Both events were ongoing at the time of 
data cut-off (31 December 2010). 
No deaths were reported during the course of either trial. 
Serious adverse events 
In study M2301, SAEs were reported more frequently for everolimus (19.2%) as compared to placebo 
(7.7%).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In M2301 haematological abnormalities were more commonly reported in everolimus-treated patients 
than in those treated with placebo. Abnormalities where a higher proportion of everolimus-treated 
patients reported events (with a ≥10% difference relative to placebo) included: Increased partial 
thromboplastin time (+24.4%), Decreased haemoglobin (+23.1%).  No grade–4 haematological 
laboratory abnormality was reported. All grade–3 cases resolved by the cut-off date of 02 March 2011.

Biochemical abnormalities that were more frequent in the everolimus arm relative to the placebo arm 
by a difference of ≥ 10% in M2301 were the following (Table 38): Cholesterol increased (+42.3%), 
Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) increased (+32.1%), Bicarbonate decreased 
(+23.1%), Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) increased (+14.1%), Triglycerides increased

Urinalysis 
In study M2301, the majority of patients did not show any notable abnormalities in blood, glucose, 
ketones, leukocytes or protein levels in the urine. No urinalysis was conducted in study C2485. 
Vital signs: 
ECGs were not routinely performed in either study.  For those that did have ECGs performed no 
clinically important changes from baseline in QTc were observed. 
Safety in special populations 
In study M2301, a difference in the incidence of events in the everolimus arm exceeding that of 
placebo was relatively higher in the youngest age group < 3 years than in patients aged between 3 
and < 18 years for: pharyngitis, cough, viral infection, neutrophil count decreased, rhinitis, 
hypercholesterolemia, dermatitis allergic, laryngitis, urticaria, dyspepsia, vomiting, and stomatitis. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study M2301, the rate of treatment discontinuation was approximately 10-fold higher in placebo-
treated patients (everolimus: 2.6%; placebo: 20.5%). Disease progression was reported as the most 
common reason for discontinuation in the placebo treatment arm (15.4%); there were no cases of 
disease progression leading to study discontinuation in the everolimus treatment arm (Table 40).

Patient disposition (Safety Set) – Study M2301 
Study C2485 
Twenty-eight patients with TSC who have SEGA were screened and subsequently enrolled between 07 
January 2007 and 18 December 2008. As of the 31 December 2010 data cut-off, 25 out of 28 patients 
are ongoing in this study; all these 25 patients have ≥ 2 years of exposure. 3 patients discontinued 
due to potential adverse events, including hyperkinesis and infection. 
Post marketing experience 
The estimated worldwide post-marketing exposure to Afinitor (everolimus) since 30 March 2009 is 
8814 PTY. The post-marketing experience with everolimus has been reviewed on an ongoing basis. No 
new information has emerged based on post-marketing usage of Afinitor that would substantially alter 
the known safety profile of everolimus in the oncology setting. Although of interest from a safety 
perspective, these data are not of direct relevance to the TSC setting due to differences in types of 
disease, concomitant medications, and therapeutic drug concentrations. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In both studies M2301 and C2485, the majority of adverse events occurring at a higher incidence in 
the everolimus arm were mouth ulceration, stomatitis, rash, acne, cytopaenias and infection. These 
are all recognised side effects of everolimus.  Subgroup analysis revealed that infection was more 
common in children age < 3 years. The MAH has added appropriate warnings to section 4.8 of the 
SmPC to highlight this increased risk. 
Neutropaenia appears to be the most commonly experienced cytopaenia, although some cases of 
lymphopaenia are also described. Grade 3 and 4 cytopaenic events were experienced in both studies. 
The longterm consequences of this immunosuppresion are unknown. 
Secondary amenorrhea has recently been added to the RMP as an identified risk. The MAH has 
committed to further investigate all serious reports, and to present a formal analysis across all studies 
following study completion. Furthermore, there is a mandated evaluation of endocrine hormone levels 
every 24 weeks, until the study ends to attempt to understand the implications of these findings. An 
international disease registry has also been set up and will collect information on adverse events 
including amenorrhea. The long-term implications of this finding are unknown. 
In addition, the effects of everolimus on neurodevelopment in children age < 3 will be included in the 
RMP as missing information. This is considered to be an adequate pharmacovigilance measure. 
Votubia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/39285/2014 
Page 62/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both studies highlighted increased incidence of haemorrhagic events, whilst study M2301 also 
highlights abnormal bleeding times. The events were primarily epistaxis. The SmPC already includes a 
warning on haemorrhagic events. 
Both studies M2301 and C2485 identify rises in triglycerides and cholesterol. This adverse reaction is 
already covered in the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
There were no new adverse reactions reported in study M2301 and the 2–year analysis of C2485. The 
safety of everolimus treatment has been appropriately addressed. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 8 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for everolimus (Votubia) in 
• 
the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who require therapeutic intervention but are not amenable to 
surgery 
could be acceptable provided that the MAH updates the RMP to include ''Effects of everolimus on brain 
growth and development, particularly in patients under 3 years of age” should be included as missing 
information. 
The following points should be taken into account in the next update: 
• 
• 
• 
The MAH should include a discussion of the risk of severe infections and pre-existing infection 
(reactivation, aggravation, or exacerbation) in the next global RMP update, including 
information on the risks in the subpopulation of patients younger than three years of age 
The format of the RMP needs to be updated in accordance with the latest EU-RMP template 
The addition of the effects of everolimus on neurodevelopment in children age < 3 included in 
the RMP as missing information. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

Important identified risks 
Non-infectious pneumonitis 
Severe infections 
Warning in SPC Section 4.4: 
“Non-infectious  pneumonitis  is  a  class  effect  of  rapamycin 
derivatives, 
including  Afinitor.  Non-infectious  pneumonitis 
(including  interstitial  lung  disease)  was  described  in  12%  of 
patients  taking  Afinitor  (see  section 4.8).  Some  cases  were 
severe  and  on  rare  occasions,  a  fatal  outcome  was  observed.  A 
diagnosis  of  non-infectious  pneumonitis  should  be  considered  in 
patients  presenting  with  non-specific  respiratory  signs  and 
symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough or dyspnoea, 
and  in  whom  infectious,  neoplastic  and  other  non-medicinal 
causes  have  been  excluded  by  means  of  appropriate 
investigations. Patients should be advised to report promptly any 
new or worsening respiratory symptoms. 
Patients  who  develop  radiological  changes  suggestive  of  non-
infectious  pneumonitis  and  have  few  or  no  symptoms  may 
continue Afinitor therapy without dose adjustments. If symptoms 
are  moderate,  consideration  should  be  given  to  interruption  of 
therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may 
be indicated. Afinitor may be reinitiated at 5 mg daily. 
For  cases  where  symptoms  of  non-infectious  pneumonitis  are 
severe,  Afinitor  therapy  should  be  discontinued  and  the  use  of 
corticosteroids  may  be  indicated  until  clinical  symptoms  resolve. 
Therapy with Afinitor may be reinitiated at 5 mg daily depending 
on the individual clinical circumstances.” 
Pneumonitis is included as ADR in SPC Section 4.8. 
Warning in SPC Section 4.4: 
“Afinitor  has  immunosuppressive  properties  and  may  predispose 
patients  to  bacterial,  fungal,  viral  or  protozoal  infections, 
including  infections  with  opportunistic  pathogens  (see  section 
4.8).  Localised  and  systemic  infections,  including  pneumonia, 
other  bacterial  infections,  invasive  fungal  infections  such  as 
aspergillosis  or  candidiasis,  and  viral 
including 
reactivation  of  hepatitis B  virus,  have  been  described  in  patients 
taking Afinitor. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., 
leading to respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally fatal. 
Physicians  and  patients  should  be  aware  of  the  increased  risk  of 
infection  with  Afinitor.  Pre-existing  infections  should  be  treated 
appropriately  and  should  have  resolved  fully  before  starting 
treatment  with  Afinitor.  While  taking  Afinitor,  be  vigilant  for

progesterone-based  contraceptives,  hysterectomy,  tubal  ligation, 
complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device [IUD], 
and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and 
for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment.” 
Information in SPC Section 4.2: 
“No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).” 
Further information in SPC Section 5.2: 
“In  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  170  patients  with 
advanced  solid  tumors,  no  significant  influence  of  creatinine 
clearance (25-178 mL/min) was detected on CL/F of everolimus. 
Post-transplant renal impairment (creatinine clearance range, 11-
107 mL/min) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of everolimus in 
transplant patients.”

dispensing tablets 
−  Update of section “distribution” with data on the uptake of everolimus and the crossing of the 
blood-brain barrier 
−  Update of section “paediatric patients” with values on Cmin based on BSA 
The Package Leaflet was updated in sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
As per the request from the CHMP, additional changes related to sections 4.2 of the SmPC have been 
included with regard to dose adjustment due to adverse reactions, which was evaluated during a 
separate procedure for Afinitor. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of Malta.  
2.10.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The pharmacology studies X2105 and X2106 assessed the pharmacokinetics of dispersible tablets of 
everolimus in healthy subjects. These studies were submitted to satisfy a measure in a PIP for age 
Votubia 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/39285/2014

appropriate formulation of Votubia 2 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg dispersible tablets for children or patients 
who cannot swallow whole tablets. The design of the studies was considered acceptable as relevant 
data was obtained on blood concentration-time profiles and Cmax, AUC and other PK parameters. The 
clinical data was considered acceptable in order to grant a bio waver for the strength of 3 mg. The data 
showed good correlation with the standard non-dispersible tablet. However, it is of note that Cmax was 
lower compared to the intact tablet suggesting that the dispersible tablet is not interchangeable with 
the non-dispersible tablet. This has been adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
The CHMP considered that the data submitted in the PK modelling study was sufficiently relevant in 
order to change the starting dose which has been increased from 3 mg/m2 to 4.5 mg/m2 for patients 
with TSC who have SEGA. 
The proposed reduction of the lower limit of the recommended therapeutic trough level from 5 to 3 
ng/ml was withdrawn by the applicant. 
The data from the PK study in rats using everolimus co-administered with cyclosporin as well as the 
toxicology review which showed no impact of everolimus on brain development were supportive of the 
extension of indication covering patients that are less than 3 years of age. The results from study 
M2301 showed a SEGA response in favour of everolimus treatment in patients that were less than 3 
years of age. Thus, the data suggested that children less than 3 years could also benefit from 
treatment with everolimus. Given these data, the extension of indication for SEGA patients less than 3 
years of age was considered appropriate. 
The updated 2 and 3–year results from study C2485 and the results from the double blind sequence of 
study M2301 confirmed the SEGA response data provided for the initial marketing authorisation and 
also the durability of the response. The SmPC has been updated to reflect the updated data from the 
clinical trials. The safety and tolerability of everolimus in the SEGA patient population continues to be 
acceptable. Thus, the benefit risk balance in the new indication “for the treatment of patients with 
subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who 
require therapeutic intervention but are not amenable to surgery.” is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
consisting of an Extension and a Type II variation to add a paediatric indication acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Extension of the Marketing Authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal product concerning: 
• 
new strengths: 2, 3 and 5 mg dispersible tablets  
and the following variation: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new

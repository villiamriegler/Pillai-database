Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for rituximab, the scientific conclusions of 
the CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on the risk of malignancy from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports 
and observational post-authorisation safety studies indicating no increased risk of malignancy in the 
autoimmune indications, the PRAC considers amendments to the product information are warranted.  
Moreover, based on evidence from literature articles of rituximab  excretion into human breast milk,  the 
PRAC considers amendments to the product information are warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for rituximab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing rituximab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2015 was based on the 
following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing autologous T cells 
transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor 
was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing a response in 
relapsed/refractory patients; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.8 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing autologous T cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 
CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data that demonstrate that remission was 
recorded in relapsed and refractory patients. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) represents the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL). It is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed germinal center B-cells 
consisting of a mixture of centrocytes (small to medium-sized cleaved follicular center cells) and 
centroblasts (large non-cleaved follicular center cells), mixed with non-malignant cells such as T-cells, 
follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages (Smith et al., 2013; Xerri et al., 2016). The WHO 
classification has adopted a grading from 1-3, where grade 3 has been subdivided into grade 3a, in 
which centrocytes are present, and grade 3b, in which there are sheets of centroblasts (Ott et al., 
2002). The clinical aggressiveness of FL increases with increasing numbers of centroblasts, and 
subsequently grades. FL grade 1-3a comprises the most prevalent indolent (low-grade) lymphoma 
subtype of NHL. FL grade 3b is categorized with other FLs but is at an intermediate stage of large cell

transformation and is typically treated as an aggressive (high-grade) lymphoma (Dreyling et al., 2021; 
Swerdlow et al., 2016). 
The aetiology of FL is still poorly understood. It has been suggested that age, gender, and ethnicity 
may affect a person’s likelihood of developing FL. The incidence of the disease increases with age; 
although in principle FL may occur at any age, it is extremely rare in children and adolescents. The 
median age at diagnosis of FL is around 60-65 years. Although onset can be gradual at the time of 
initial diagnosis, advanced FL is typically incurable, and the response rates are lower with shorter 
durations of response with successive lines of therapy. 
FL involves lymph nodes, but also spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and Waldeyer ring. 
Involvement of non-haematopoietic extra-nodal sites, such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or soft 
tissue are uncommon but may occur in a setting of widespread nodal disease. FL may occasionally be 
primary in extra-nodal sites, including skin, GI tract, particularly the duodenum, ocular adnexa, breast, 
and testis. 
Patients with FL generally present with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, with waxing and waning 
symptoms present for years. Most patients therefore have widespread disease at diagnosis, including 
peripheral and central (abdominal and thoracic) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Approximately 
10% of the patients have localized disease at diagnosis and less than 20% present with B symptoms 
(fever, night sweats and weight loss) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The 
bone marrow is involved in 40-70% of the cases (Swerdlow et al., 2016; Freedman, 2020). As an 
intrinsic disease characteristic, FL typically evolve over time to an aggressive subtype, in 15% of 
cases. Disease relapse is usually rapid, where remissions become a serious challenge despite multiple 
interventions. Eventually, patients succumb to the refractory, high-grade disease transformation and 
the complications driven by treatments. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) 
follicular lymphoma (FL) after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “Treatment of follicular lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CAT/CHMP 
(see EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Patients with advanced stage FL disease may experience B symptoms and suffer from unexplained 
fatigue/asthenia, local effects of lymphadenopathy such as abdominal pain, chest pain, cough or 
dyspnoea, or symptoms of bone marrow failure leading to cytopenia. Other symptoms depend on the 
location of the lymphoma (e.g., GI bleeding due to GI lymphomas, superior vena cava syndrome due 
to vein compression, renal failure due to ureter compression, and rarely spinal cord compression). 
Particularly patients with relapsed disease may have reduced quality of life. 
Although the life expectancy has improved due to recent therapeutic advances, FL patients frequently 
relapse and become progressively more refractory to subsequent lines of therapy. Advanced-stage FL 
is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy, although patients often have good responses 
to treatment and might live for several years. The survival outcome worsens significantly as the 
patients progress through multiple lines of therapy and most patients eventually die of progressive 
lymphoma and its complications (Link et al., 2019). Furthermore, histologic transformation to high-

grade NHLs that are clinically more aggressive with a poor outcome is relatively common in patients 
with FL, occurring at a rate of approximately 2-3% per year (Kridel et al., 2016; Freedman, 2018). 
The sponsor has not identified any changes in the severe nature of the condition since the orphan 
designation in 2015. FL remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating, mainly due to 
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation to 
aggressive lymphoma. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor performed a review of epidemiological data to calculate the prevalence of FL in Europe. 
Published data from national, regional and global population-based cancer registries and other relevant 
sources including the Association of Nordic Cancer Registries (ANCR; Denmark, Sweden, Finland, 
Norway, and Iceland; 2018 data), CancerMPact (Europe5: Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and the UK; 
2021 data), Global Burden of Disease (GBD; EU28; 2019 data), HMRN (Yorkshire region in the UK; 
2007-2016 data), and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC; EU28 as defined by WHO; 
2020 data) were searched. In addition, a search on PubMed and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed 
articles reporting frequency measures for FL during the period 2007-2020 was conducted, but no 
information on direct prevalence estimates for FL was obtained from the published reports found. 
The sponsor has provided a prevalence estimate based on a literature search and assumptions 
regarding 5 year and 10 to 20-year survival. They do not appear to have consulted ECIS.  
The sponsor noted that the median survival rate of FL ranges between 10-20 years, with a 5-year 
survival of 80-90% (Buske et al., 2012; Federico et al., 2009; Provencio et al., 2017). In addition, FL 
has been reported to represent 20% of all NHL cases (Casulo 2015a et al., Luminari et al., 2019, 
Maurer et al., 2014).

The sponsor argued that the epidemiology of FL has not been well characterised. There are only a few 
peer-reviewed published articles on the epidemiology of FL in Europe and there is limited information 
provided in the epidemiological data sources. Most population-based studies and epidemiological data 
sources estimate haematological malignancies at broader categories (such as Hodgkin versus non-
Hodgkin lymphoma). For example, data sources such as ANCR, GBD, and IARC registries do not 
provide direct FL estimates. It has been noted that due to the paucity of epidemiological literature on 
FL, it is unclear whether the distribution of NHL prevalence by age and sex is similar in FL. 
Based on the review of the epidemiological data sources found and the above-mentioned assumptions, 
the sponsor concluded that the highest 1-year, 5-year and 10-year prevalence of FL reported in Europe 
was 2.09, 2.02 and 3.63 per 10,000 persons, respectively {ANCR 2018, GBD 2019, HMRN 2019, IARC 
2020}. In view of the most recent prevalence figures accepted for this condition, it appeared that the 
assumptions regarding the incidence and survival for the prevalence estimate are underestimated. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000068456 
Page 7/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The sponsor provided a revised prevalence estimate for FL upon request. According to ECIS, the 2020 
age standardized incidence of NHL in EU27 was 1.83 per 10,000 persons (a). Kanas and colleagues 
established NHL subtype distribution from peer-reviewed literature and showed that the weighted 
average (weighted by study population size) for the FL proportion across EU was 16.3% (Kanas et al., 
2022a) (b). The incidence of FL was estimated using the formula: Incidence of NHL (a) x Proportion of 
NHL presented as FL (b). The estimated incidence of FL based on this was 0.298 per 10,000 persons. 
The sponsor then indicated that a search of epidemiological data sources was conducted to estimate 
the overall median duration of the disease, based on reported median overall survival (OS), which 
ranged from 11 years to 16.3 years (Mozas et al., 2020; Provencio et al., 2017). For this estimation, 
the sponsor limited the sources to studies published using real-world data only, randomized control 
trials and USA only specific estimates were excluded. 
A maximum median OS was then used by the sponsor to estimate the complete prevalence for FL 
(16.3 years). The updated prevalence was calculated using the standard formula Prevalence (P) = 
Incidence of FL (I) x Median OS (D) = 0.298 x 16.3 = 4.85 per 10,000 persons in the EU. The final 
proposed estimate of 4.85 in 10,000 people was accepted by the COMP and rounded off to 4.9 in 
10,000 people in the European community. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor described the treatment methods available to patients with FL based on European and 
American treatment guidelines (Dreyling et al., 2021; NCCN 2020). Several therapies are authorised 
both centrally and nationally in the EU for treatment of adult patients with FL, NHL, and lymphomas. 
These medicines include rituximab (MabThera), yttrium-90 [90Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan 
(Zevalin), idelalisib (Zydelig), duvelisib (Copiktra), obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), 
bendamustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, interferon-
alpha-2a/b, prednisolone, and vincristine. Other treatment options also exist, such as radiotherapy and 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or allogenic SCT. 
Patients with newly diagnosed FL are generally treated with an anti-CD20 antibody in monotherapy, 
rituximab (R) or obinutuzumab (G), or an anti-CD20-containing regimen (e.g., G/R-B, G/R-CHOP, and 
G/R-CVP). Available treatment options for r/r FL patients depends on the patient’s health, age, stage of 
disease, comorbidities, tumour burden, and the type and duration of response to prior therapy. The 
most recent European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines for newly diagnosed and 
relapsed FL describe the current standard of care for these patients (Dreyling, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 
298-308). According to the guidelines, therapy should be initiated only upon the development of 
symptoms. The guidelines identify two types of FL patient populations that are offered two different 
treatment algorithms depending on their tumour burden. 
The clinical course of FL is characterized by recurrences requiring multiple lines of treatment until 
eventually patients run out of treatment options and develop fatal disease resistant to any available 
treatment.

* Patients with histological grade 3b FL were excluded from the pivotal study for the indication extension of 
Yescarta to FL (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004480/II/0042). Since grade 3b FL biologically is more closely related to 
DLBCL than to the other forms of FL, these patients are often treated as an aggressive lymphoma such as DLBCL, 
for which Yescarta is already indicated. The CAT/CHMP therefore concluded during the assessment of the type II 
variation that the product should be intended for FL without any grade-relevant restrictions, since an extrapolation 
of the positive benefit/risk balance of Yescarta observed in the studied FL grade 1-3a and DLBCL populations to 
patients with FL grade 3b can be considered acceptable. The label of Yescarta is thus for all grades of FL. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor did not seek protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

The sponsor argued that axi-cel represents a significant benefit based on the improved efficacy 
observed in the pivotal study ZUMA-5 for the indication extension compared to therapies approved in 
the EU for the treatment of adult patients with r/r FL in the fourth- and later lines setting. A post hoc 
analysis using supportive datasets from SCHOLAR-5 was presented to provide further context to the 
clinical outcomes in ZUMA-5. 
The primary data supporting the efficacy and safety of axi-cel in the extension of indication to include 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) FL were obtained from the ongoing, open-
label, multicentre, single-arm phase 2 study ZUMA-5. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of axi-cel in adults with r/r indolent NHL (iNHL), including FL. Eligible FL patients (≥18 
years) had r/r FL grade 1-3a after at least two prior lines of therapy, which must have included an 
anti-CD20 therapy combined with an alkylating agent. Patients with histological grade 3b FL were 
excluded from the study. Axi-cel was administered as a single IV infusion with a target dose of 2x106 
anti-CD19 CAR+ T-cells/kg (1.0-2.4×106 anti-CD19 CAR+ T-cells/kg). For patients weighing greater 
than 100 kg, a maximum flat dose of 2x108 anti-CD19 CAR+ T-cells was administered. 
Data were reported from an extended 24-month follow-up analysis with a data cut-off (DCO) date of 
31-mar-2021. The primary endpoint of ZUMA-5 is objective response rate (ORR), defined as the 
proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed 
by central review per Lugano 2014 classification response criteria (Cheson, J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32(27): 
3059-68). Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR and CR per central assessment for patients who 
had at least three lines of prior therapy, duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival 
(PFS) both per central and investigator assessments, and OS. 
Among the 75 patients with FL who received 3 or more prior lines of therapy in the FAS excluding 
centrally confirmed non-FL, the median age was 60.0 years (range: 34-79) and 31% (23/75) were 65 
years of age or older. Most of the patients were white (93%; 70/75) and males (63%; 47/75). The 
majority had stage III or IV disease (87%; 65/75) (at initial diagnosis) and refractory disease (77%; 
58/75). More than half of the patients (57%; 43/75) had high tumour bulk as defined by GELF criteria. 
The FLIPI score was also high in 45% (34/75) of the patients and around half of patients (51%; 38/75) 
had a history of disease progression within 24 months of initiating their first chemoimmunotherapy 
(POD24). The patients had a median of 4 prior lines of therapy (range: 3-10), where 33% (25/75) had 
received 4 prior lines and 27% (20/75) had received 5 or more prior lines of therapy. All patients had 
received a prior anti-CD20 therapy and an alkylated agent, and 24% (18/75) were considered double 
refractory (refractory to the first 2 lines of therapy). In addition, 29% (22/75) had previously received 
an ASCT, 40% (30/75) had previously received a PI3K inhibitor, and 37% (28/75) had previously been 
treated with lenalidomide. 
The baseline data submitted showed that patients recruited included those who were relapsed or 
refractory to 5 lines or more of therapy where PI3K inhibitors such as Zydelig and Copiktra, or anti-
CD20 therapy such as MabThera, Gazyvaro and Zevalin, or anthracyclins such as Pixruvi as well as 
Revlimid (lenalidomide) had been used.  
At the DCO for the extended 24-month follow-up analysis, the primary endpoint ORR was 91% (68/75; 
95% CI: 82, 96) in FL patients who had received 3 or more prior lines of therapy (FAS, leukapheresed 
patients). The observed benefit of axi-cel in terms of ORR was supported by the secondary endpoints. 
The CR rate was 77% (58/75; 95% CI: 66, 86) in the subset of patients corresponding to the proposed 
therapeutic indication. The Kaplan-Meier median estimates for DOR was 38.6 months (95% CI: 24.7, 
not estimable [NE]) and 40.2 months (95% CI: 26.6, NE) for PFS. The median OS was not reached at 
the last DCO.

In study 106-06, treatment with ibritumomab resulted in an ORR and CR rate of 74% (95% CI: 60, 
85) and 15% (95% CI: 7, 27), respectively. A median DOR of 6.4 months and a median time to 
progression (TTP) of 6.8 months was shown (Zevalin SmPC; Witzig et al., 2007). The FL patients in 
this study had received a median of 4 (range: 1-9) prior regimens. In study 106-04, the ORR and CR 
rate was significantly higher in patients treated with ibritumomab compared to rituximab with 80% 
versus 56%, and 30% versus 16%, respectively. Of note, all patients in this study were rituximab 
naïve which would challenge applicability of the efficacy outcomes in the contemporary era where 
almost all r/r FL patients have received prior treatment with rituximab. The duration of CR and TTP, 
however, were not significantly different between the two treatment arms, not in the overall patient 
population, nor in the FL subgroup (Gordon et al., 2004). The median PFS was 11.2 and 10.1 months 
for patients in the ibritumomab and rituximab arms, respectively (Zevalin SmPC). By contrast, ZUMA-5 
demonstrated an ORR of 91%, with a CR rate of 77%, and the median PFS was 40.2 months. 
The sponsor concluded that the efficacy outcomes observed in ZUMA-5 demonstrated a substantial 
benefit of axi-cel in r/r FL patients after ≥3 prior lines of therapy, a disease setting which currently 
lacks any optimal authorised treatments. 
The data obtained from the pivotal phase 2 study 106-06 is considered the most relevant evidence to 
contextualize the benefit of Yescarta over Zevalin. The sponsor did not provide any comparison of 
baseline characteristics for the study populations from the two pivotal studies ZUMA-5 and 106-06 but 
noted that ZUMA-5 encompassed a more heavily pre-treated patient population, enriched for high-risk 
features such as POD24 and refractory disease. The reported efficacy outcomes from the two clinical 
studies indicated that patients with r/r FL treated with axi-cel in ZUMA-5 achieved a more durable and 
higher ORR and CR rate compared to patients treated with ibritumomab in the pivotal study 106-06. 
Specifically, the CR rate of axi-cel in ZUMA-5 was >5 times higher than that reported for ibritumomab 
in study 106-06 (77% vs. 15%). The ORR was also higher (91% vs. 74%) and the reported DOR more 
durable for axi-cel than ibritumomab (median 6.4 months for ibritumomab and 38.6 months for axi-cel 
at the DCO for an extended 24-month follow-up analysis) in patients with r/r FL who had received 
three or more prior lines of therapy. 
The indirect comparison of efficacy data from the two pivotal single-arm studies ZUMA-5 and 106-06 
provide adequate evidence to support the claim for SB of axi-cel based on better efficacy in terms of 
higher, deeper, and more durable responses compared to ibritumomab in r/r FL patients in the fourth- 
and later lines setting. 
The COMP agreed to recommend maintaining the orphan designation. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 12 May 2022 
The COMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of follicular lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.9 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma;

• 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Yescarta may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical study data which 
demonstrated improved and sustained response rates after treatment with Yescarta as compared 
to Zevalin in adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after three or more lines 
of systemic therapy. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Yescarta, autologous T cells 
transduced with retroviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor, 
axicabtagene ciloleucel for treatment of follicular lymphoma (EU/3/15/1579) is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

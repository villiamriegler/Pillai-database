PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Briviact® 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Briviact. The RMP details important 
risks of Briviact, how this risk can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Briviact's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Briviact's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Briviact should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Briviact should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Briviact's 
RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
1 
Briviact is authorised for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalization in adult and adolescent patients from 4 years of age with 
epilepsy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains brivaracetam as the active substance and 
it is given by oral tablet in the following strengths:10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 75mg, and 100mg film-
coated tablets, or by 10mg/mL oral solution, or by injection of 10mg/mL solution for injection . 
Further information about the evaluation of Briviact’s benefits can be found in Briviact’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency website, 
under the medicine’s webpage:

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of Briviact, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Biviact's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
 
 
 
 
In the case of Briviact, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment - so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Briviact is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Briviact are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Briviact. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk minimization 
measures 
Suicide-related events have been reported more often in people who have 
epilepsy than in the general population.  
Common additional disorders in patients with epilepsy that increase the risk of 
suicide include depression and learning difficulties or disability. A small 
increased risk of suicide-related events has also been reported in patients with 
epilepsy taking antiepileptic drugs including Briviact. 
Routine risk minimization measures:  
Available by prescription only 
SmPC Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use [class wording]), 
and SmPC Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) 
Packaging:  
- 
that requires a sequential withdrawal of the tablets, which could interfere with 
accomplishment of suicidal thoughts. 
- 
Intravenous formulation is provided in vials containing 50mg of 
brivaracetam in total, and the administration will be performed by a health care 
professional and not the patient.  
Additional risk minimization measures: None 
The brivaracetam oral tablet pack contains unit dose packaging (blister) 
Important identified risk: Aggression 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk groups or risk 
factors 
A small increased risk of aggression has been reported in patients with epilepsy 
taking antiepileptic drugs including Briviact. 
The relationship between aggression and epilepsy is complex and not well 
understood. Some factors that have been reported to increase the risk for 
aggression in patients with epilepsy include organic cerebral disease, low 
socioeconomic status, and poor upbringing (Tebartz, 2002). Aggression may 
result as a consequence of depression, anxiety, or in the context of an antisocial 
personality disorder (Kanner, 2004).

Important potential risk: Neutropenia 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
A slight decrease in neutrophils is not usually serious, but a large decrease can 
be serious and increase the chance of infection.

Important potential risk: Worsening of seizures (as an anticonvulsant product) 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Seizures may increase or become worse while taking Briviact. However, these 
could be the results of changes in the patient’s overall health or the underlying 
epilepsy getting worse. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
There are several risk factors that have been associated with seizure worsening 
or aggravation including changes in therapy, sleep deprivation, intercurrent 
illness, use of alcohol and other recreational drugs, over the counter 
medications, coadministration of seizure provoking drugs, drug interactions, 
hormonal changes, the development of drug resistance, fever, and nonadherence 
with therapy (Somerville, 2009). Drug-related seizure increase has been 
documented at higher rates among pregnant women (Reisinger et al, 2013). 
Additionally, patients are at higher risk post-epilepsy surgery (Sarkis et al, 
2012). 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
Available by prescription only 
Additional risk minimization measures: None 
Important potential risk: Abuse potential (as a CNS-active product) 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Briviact may produce a calming effect or sleepiness, especially when taken at 
higher doses. Briviact should be used only for the treatment of seizures. 
Abuse of brivaracetam (the active substance in Briviact) may cause serious 
medical problems, particularly problems that affect the nervous system. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
History of drug abuse could be a potential risk factor. Additionally, psychiatric 
comorbidities and impacts of epilepsy have been found to be associated with 
substance abuse (Hesdorffer et al, 2012).

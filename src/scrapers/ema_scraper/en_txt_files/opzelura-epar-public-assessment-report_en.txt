2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease characterised by depigmented patches of skin with a selective loss of 
melanocytes (Krüger and Schallreuter 2012). Generalised (non-segmental) vitiligo is the most common 
type, accounting for up to 90% of cases (Taïeb and Picardo 2009). The natural course of the disease is 
generally unpredictable, but it is often progressive. Some degree of spontaneous repigmentation may 
occur in 10% to 20% of patients; however, often not to a cosmetically acceptable extent for many 
patients (Castanet and Ortonne 1997). Vitiligo affects people of all ethnicities and skin types with no 
clear differences in prevalence based on these characteristics (Alkhateeb et al 2003, Bergqvist and 
Ezzedine 2020, Ezzedine et al 2015, Picardo et al 2015). Men and women are equally affected, 
although women appear to seek treatment more often (Picardo et al 2015).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The prevalence of vitiligo is about 0.5%-2%, with reported rates varying geographically (Bergqvist and 
Ezzedine, 2020). It can appear at any age, with a peak incidence in the second and third decade, with 
about 50% of the cases occurring before 20 years of age, and 70-80% before the age of 30 years. 
Non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) develops at all ages, but usually occurs between 10 and 30 years of age; 
segmental vitiligo (SV) tends to occur at a younger age than NSV; 41.3% before the age of 10 years 
with a mean onset of 15.6 and the latest onset at age 54 years (Than and Lee, J Am Acad Dermatol, 
1996). There is no predominance of racial, ethnic, or socio-economic class (UptoDate), but there seem 
to be geographical differences (Bergqvist and Ezzedine, 2020). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology of vitiligo is unclear, but progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis, 
which seems overlapping for segmental and non-segmental vitiligo. It is classified as an auto-immune 
disease associated with genetic and environmental factors together with metabolic, oxidative stress, 
and cell detachment abnormalities. It is a multistep process and involves initial release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and neuropeptides elicited by external or internal injury, with vascular 
dilatation and immune response. Both the innate and adaptive immune system are involved, but it is 
assumed to be a primary Th1-mediated process dependent on the production of INF-gamma to drive 
the response. CD8+ cells are found in sites of depigmentation, and there is evidence that they play a 
significant role in the destruction of melanocytes. T-cells express activation molecules in perilesional 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 9/152 
 
 
 
vitiligo skin, as well as cytokines such as INF-gamma and TNF-alpha. Through these mechanisms, 
infiltrating T-cells kill melanocytes within the skin and cause loss of pigmentation in NSV. Observations 
in support of this hypothesis are that lesional CD8+ T-cells in vitro induce melanocyte apoptosis from 
unaffected skin and JAK1 expression (as downstream effector of IFN-gamma) is higher within 
vitiliginous skin compared to healthy skin.  
As INFy signalling involves the JAK-STAT pathway, JAK-inhibition may be a useful strategy to treat 
vitiligo. Case reports on oral JAKi in inflammatory skin disease suggested efficacy but is limited due to 
side effects (mainly due to haematological side effects). As an alternative method of administration, 
topical treatment may be useful as it would locally inhibit disease activity and have at least potentially 
less systemic (adverse) effects.  
Figure 1: The role of JAK inhibition in the pathogenesis of vitiligo 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and clinical course 
The clinical presentation of vitiligo typically involves asymptomatic depigmented patches and macules, 
without clinical signs of inflammation. In some cases, sunburn, pregnancy, skin trauma or emotional 
stress precede presentation. The disease has a predilection for the face and areas around the orifices, 
genitals, and hands. Depigmented areas may show more than one colour shade (trichrome, 
quadrichrome, pentachrome). Classification is based on the Vitiligo Global Issues Consensus 
Conference (2012), which defined two broad categories: non-segmental (NSV; being the most 
common) and segmental vitiligo (SV). The two other categories are mixed (SV and NSV), and 
unclassified. NSV is further categorised into generalised, acro / acrofacial, focal, mucosal, or universal 
subtypes; the first being the most prevalent. SV typically occurs in a (quasi)dermatomal pattern, most 
frequently along the trigeminal nerve. It is less common than NSV and presents most often in 
childhood.  
The clinical course of vitiligo is unpredictable, with stable disease, slow progression over years, flares, 
etc. Progression is more common in patients with a family history of NSV, longer disease duration, 
Koebner phenomenon, or mucosal involvement.  
Diagnosis is usually quite straightforward, based on clinical presentation of well-demarcated, uniformly 
white macules surrounded by normal skin in the absence of inflammatory signs. The differential 
diagnosis is extensive and comprises chemically induced leukoderma, topical or systemic drug-induced 
depigmentation, post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, neoplasm-related hypomelanoses, idiopathic 
hypomelanosis, congenital hypomelanosis, and other conditions. The diagnosis may be facilitated by 
Assessment report

Page 10/152 
 
 
 
 
 
using a Wood's lamp or dermoscopy. A skin biopsy is not often required but may be helpful in some 
cases. Histology then shows complete loss of melanin pigment in the epidermis and absence of 
melanocytes. Other findings may be vacuolar degeneration of keratinocytes, spongiosis, dermal 
lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemical staining shows a predominance of CD8+ positive T-
lymphocytes.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There are no approved medicinal products for repigmentation in vitiligo, and evidence for the 
effectiveness of drug therapies used off-label is limited. Few randomised and controlled clinical studies 
have evaluated potential treatments, and interpretation of these studies is hampered by small study 
sizes as well as heterogeneity of study designs, methodologies, and measures (Eleftheriadou 
et al 2012, Whitten et al 2016). The current management of vitiligo is, therefore, empirical and based 
on consensus guidelines (American Academy of Dermatology 2020, Gawkrodger et al 2008, Taieb et al 
2013, Vitiligo Research Foundation 2020). In general, first-line treatments consist of topical steroids 
and calcineurin inhibitors, which are most useful for treating limited disease (typically ≤ 10% BSA is 
treated). Second-line treatments consist of phototherapy (NB-UVB and PUVA) and systemic steroid 
treatment, and next-line treatments consist of surgical grafting techniques and depigmenting 
treatments. Responses to current treatment options vary and have limited durability. Treatments can 
also be time-intensive and burdensome to the patient and may produce cosmetically unacceptable 
results.  
Being a disease with high psychological burden, there is a need for effective repigmentation treatment 
options in vitiligo. Current treatment is based on off-label application of topical corticosteroids and 
calcineurin inhibitors, whether or not combined with phototherapy, and when insufficient effect is 
achieved, systemic corticosteroids and phototherapy are applied. Finally, surgery and depigmentation 
treatment may be considered in severe cases. Use of topical therapies (corticosteroid and calcineurin 
inhibitors), which are usually applied in limited disease (< 10% BSA), is hampered by side effects and 
their effectiveness is still inconclusive. Research on vitiligo treatment is characterised by the absence 
of uniform outcome measures, small sample sizes, and deficiencies in methodological quality. As a 
result, there is an unmet need for safe and effective treatment options.  
2.2.  About the product 
Ruxolitinib phosphate (INCB018424) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the JAKs with selectivity for 
JAK1 and JAK2. Pharmacological data obtained in both in vitro and in vivo model systems support the 
use of ruxolitinib in the treatment of vitiligo. Ruxolitinib potently inhibits the expression of several 
vitiligo-relevant immune mediators, including IFNγ, CXCL10, and Granzyme B.  
Ruxolitinib is a well-known active substance, already approved as an oral drug for the treatment of 
moderate / severe myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and Graft versus host disease (Jakavi, 
EMEA/H/C/002464). 
Ruxolitinib cream is a topical formulation of ruxolitinib phosphate.  
The recommended dose is a thin layer of cream applied twice daily to the depigmented skin areas up 
to a maximum of 10% of body surface area (BSA), with a minimum of 8 hours between two 
applications (see SmPC section 4.2 for full text). 
The Article 20 referral procedure for JAK inhibitors used in chronic inflammatory disorders finalised on 
January 2023 (CHMP opinion; EC decision pending) recommended measures to minimise the risk of 
serious side effects with JAKi. The data currently available for ruxolitinib cream do not support the 
Assessment report

need to include specific warnings in the SmPC regarding those class effects as the systemic exposure, 
given the different route of administration of Opzelura (ruxolitinib cream), is considered to be 
sufficiently low, not to lead to systemic effects including VTE, MACE, malignancy other than NMSC, and 
serious infections.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The application was submitted under the legal basis 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC which corresponds to 
a complete and independent application.  
The applicant requested EMA scientific advice for ruxolitinib in the treatment of vitiligo. The questions 
concerned the quality, clinical and non-clinical development (see section 1.5. ‘Scientific advice’).

The chemical structure of ruxolitinib phosphate was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 
IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C), mass spectrometry and UV spectroscopy. The 
obtained spectra are in agreement with the assigned structure. The molecular structure of ruxolitinib 
phosphate active substance was independently confirmed using single crystal X-ray diffraction. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by XRPD, differential scanning 
calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis.  
Ruxolitinib phosphate is a white to off-white to light pink powder. Relevant physicochemical properties 
(hygroscopicity, solubility at different pH buffer solutions and organic solvents, melting point, 
dissociation constants and partition coefficients) have been investigated. Ruxolitinib phosphate is very 
slightly soluble in aqueous medium (pH 1-8), slightly soluble in isopropanol and sparingly soluble in 
ethanol. 
Ruxolitinib phosphate contains a single chiral centre in the (R)-configuration. The stereocentre is 
introduced selectively in the manufacturing process and routinely controlled in relevant intermediates 
and the active substance. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ruxolitinib phosphate is synthesized using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags inside a HDPE drum. Relevant materials comply 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identity, chiral purity, assay, 
impurities, residual solvents, elemental impurities, water content, and phosphate content. 
The specifications adopted for ruxolitinib phosphate active substance are derived from ICH guidelines, 
the Ph. Eur. and batch data. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to 
ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been 
set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from production scale batches of active substance, stored in the intended commercial 
package up to 60 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 13/152 
 
 
 
stability-indicating parameters were tested: description, chiral purity, water content, related 
substances and assay. No significant changes or trends to any of the measured parameters were 
observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on two batches. No degradation 
was observed, ruxolitinib phosphate is photostable. Forced degradation studies indicate that ruxolitinib 
is generally stable and is most susceptible to alkaline degradation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify 
the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Opzelura is a white to off-white oil-in-water, solubilised emulsion cream containing 15 mg ruxolitinib 
per 1 g of cream (1.5 wt%), stored in a lined aluminium tube. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report.  
The finished product was developed to a physically and chemically stable multi-use topical formulation 
for the treatment of vitiligo. The phosphate salt of ruxolitinib was selected relative to other salt forms. 
Furthermore, the active substance was shown to be extremely stable during stability studies and no 
incompatibility with any of the excipients was observed. The key physicochemical parameters of 
ruxolitinib cream are homogeneity and emulsion stability. An appropriate quality target product profile 
(QTPP) has been provided for the development of a cream formulation.  
Description, identification, absence of crystals, assay, degradation products, uniformity in container, 
viscosity, package integrity, preservative content, in vitro release test (IVRT) and microbial purity were 
identified as the critical quality attributes (CQAs), which is acceptable for a cream. An acceptable 
justification for the selection of the finished product CQAs was provided in the dossier. All CQAs are 
routinely controlled in the finished product specification. 
The excipients and container closure system are common for this type of dosage form. The 
components of the cream, their functions and references to standards were provided and explained. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. 
The preservative system comprises a combination of phenoxyethanol, methyl- and propylparaben. The 
need for a preservative is justified given the high (50%) water content and that the product is a multi-
use formulation. However, the applicant did not justify that the content had been minimised as per EU 
guidance and this resulted in a major objection (MO) during the procedure. In response, the applicant 
demonstrated that there is no concern from a safety point of view. Nonetheless, the applicant is 
recommended to investigate alternative formulations post-approval with reduced preservative content 
and amend the formulation as dictated by the study results (REC). The applicant has provided a 
development plan to investigate low preservative formulations which was reviewed and considered 
acceptable. The finished product is indicated for use in in adults and adolescents from age 12. The 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) has been endorsed and the formulation is considered appropriate for 
use in children aged 6 and above. 
The formulations and manufacturing process have not changed over the course of product 
development comprising material used in clinical trials. Overall, the formulation development has been 
sufficiently described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 14/152 
 
 
 
The finished product manufacturing process was developed based on the QTPP. It essentially consists 
of the preparation of various liquid components by either melting or dissolution followed by the key 
emulsification step. The proposed CQAs and the critical steps in the manufacturing process have been 
thoroughly evaluated at the initially proposed manufacturing site. Design of Experiment (DoE) studies 
were conducted to study the connection between process critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
product CQAs. Based on those results and prior knowledge IPCs, CPPs and PARs were determined 
establishing the overall control strategy for the manufacturing process of ruxolitinib cream. Therefore, 
batches were manufactured at production scale including the official validation batches. All batches 
met with the acceptance criteria indicating a robust process at the intended commercial scale. During 
development, a second manufacturing site was introduced. Small modification to several unit 
operations were implemented to accommodate the different equipment. The applicant submitted 
comparability data including IVRT results in an effort to demonstrate the sameness of product 
manufactured at the two sites. Initially, the CHMP judged that the sameness had not been sufficiently 
demonstrated as there were differences in some measured parameters (e.g. non-Newtonian behaviour, 
active substance release profiles) resulting in a MO. In addition, the IVRT methods in place at both 
sites were not considered sufficiently robust and the CHMP requested to see comparability data on 
more parameters. In response, the applicant developed a new IVRT method which is used to measure 
the release profiles of batches from both sites. The new method is considered to be suitably validated 
and is sufficiently discriminatory. The IVRT data, allied to the totality of batch data in line with the 
draft “Guideline on the quality and equivalence of topical products” demonstrates the sameness of the 
creams manufactured at both sites. The MO was resolved and finished product is considered equivalent 
to that used in the clinical trials. 
The primary packaging is an aluminium tube with internal lacquer coating with a polypropylene 
puncture cap. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The suitability of the selected 
container closure system was evaluated in terms of protection, compatibility and safety. Extractable 
and leachable studies have been conducted, considering both mutagenic and elemental impurities. 
There is negligible risk from the container closure. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of several main steps: preparation of a melted oil phase; 
preparation of the aqueous solution; compounding of the oil and aqueous phases; emulsification and 
cooling; mixing and cooling. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Initially, the CHMP considered the process to be non-standard given the low active substance content 
and emulsified formulation and therefore requested formal validation data in addition to the provided 
validation scheme, resulting in a MO. In response, the applicant argued that the extent of batches 
manufactured to date at large scale, the consistent content uniformity data, and the experience with 
similar products at the proposed commercial manufacturer justified the process being considered 
standard. The CHMP agreed with the arguments provided. Major steps of the manufacturing process 
have been validated on over 20 production scale batches across both sites. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. Critical steps of the manufacturing process have been defined. The IPCs which 
focus on critical unit operations are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description, identification, assay, degradation products, uniformity of active ingredient, pH, 
viscosity, globule size, absence of ruxolitinib crystals, IVRT, minimum fill, weight loss, package

integrity, preservative content, and microbial limits. The finished product specification is in compliance 
with ICH Q6A on specifications. The limits set are based on the data obtained during development, 
batch analysis and stability studies. A justification has been presented for each parameter of the 
specification. The provided release and shelf-life specifications list adequate parameters for a cream.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment, considering the limits for relevant impurities already included in the active substance 
specification and taking into account the cutaneous administration route, it was be concluded that 
there is no risk of elemental impurities above their respective PDEs and no limits are needed in the 
finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004 - Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no confirmatory testing was requested, nor 
specific control measures deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for production scale batches and supportive data from batches used 
in clinical development confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 21 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30ºC / 75% 
RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Supportive data from a 
previous manufacturer was also provided. The following parameters were tested: description, assay, 
degradation products, uniformity in container, pH, viscosity, globule size, weight loss, package 
integrity, preservative content, microbial limits, and IVRT. No significant changes or trends to any of 
the measured parameters were observed, other than a steady decrease in viscosity under all 
conditions. In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. In the absence of the packaging, a slight increase in 
impurities was observed. However, the aluminium tube was shown to provide adequate protection. 
A freeze-thaw study was conducted, cycling the tubes of cream between accelerated conditions and -
20ºC. Little or no impact on any measured parameters were observed. 
An in-use study was conducted on batches of differing storage time (7 months and 29 months). Tubes 
were opened, cream dispensed, and the tubes re-sealed weekly for 26 weeks. No significant quality

changes were observed. The proposed in-use shelf-life of 6 months (SmPC section 6.3) is deemed 
acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 21 months and the in-use shelf-life of 6 
months, stored at or below 30ºC as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant provided additional justification that the 
process can be considered as standard to resolve the MO on process validation. In addition, the IVRT 
method was re-developed and used, among other tests, to demonstrate the sameness of the creams 
manufactured at the different manufacturing sites. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
It has not yet been justified from a quality point of view that the preservative content of the cream is 
as low as possible, while maintaining effectiveness. While preservative levels are considered acceptable 
from a safety point of view, the applicant should conduct post-approval studies to determine whether a 
lower effective preservative level is possible and re-develop the formulation accordingly. This point is 
put forward and agreed as a recommendation for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant is recommended to investigate alternative formulations post-approval with 
reduced preservative content in line with the provided development plan and to re-formulate 
the product as dictated by the study results. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Ruxolitinib has been developed as a cream for the topical treatment of vitiligo with the aim of impeding 
the CD8+ T-cell-mediated pathogenesis of vitiligo. In support to this MAA the applicant submitted a 
comprehensive panel of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies, including those 
that were conducted for Jakavi (EMEA/H/C/002464), oral tablets. Besides primary pharmacodynamic 
studies, ruxolitinib was evaluated in a non-GLP Cerep ExpresSProfile screen against various kinases, 
Assessment report

Page 17/152 
 
 
 
receptors, transporters for potential cross-reactivity. Pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib following oral or 
dermal administration has been determined in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys and minipigs. 
Toxicology of ruxolitinib following oral administration has been previously evaluated for Jakavi tablets 
for oral use (EMEA/H/C/002464). The dossier included the safety pharmacology studies, general 
toxicity studies in rats (up to 6 months) and dogs (up to 1 year), in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity 
studies, carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice (26-weeks), fertility and early embryonic development 
study in male and female rats, embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, a pre- and 
postnatal development study in rats, juvenile toxicity studies in rats. 
Newly submitted studies to evaluate safety of topical use of ruxolitinib for the indication of vitiligo 
included repeat dose dermal toxicity studies in CD-1 mice and Göttingen minipigs, in vitro 
photoclastogenicity study, dermal 2-year carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, 2-year carcinogenicity 
study in rats, acute dermal and ocular irritation studies in rabbits, the mouse local lymph node 
hypersensitivity study, phototoxicity and photo-allergy studies in hairless albino guinea pigs. 
For topical studies, the cream formulation used was the same as the clinical ruxolitinib cream 
formulation. The excipients contained in the drug product are well known, commonly used in the 
manufacture of medicinal products intended for cutaneous use and of the Ph. Eur. quality, except for 
glyceryl stearate SE. 
In general, findings in toxicology studies were limited to those expected based on the pharmacologic 
activity of ruxolitinib and associated effects on the immune system. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology of ruxolitinib has been studied in vitro and in vivo. Information on oral dose as well 
as after dermal application is provided. The systemic exposure from ruxolitinib 1.5% cream may 
overlap with that from orally administered ruxolitinib, and therefore, non-clinical information from oral 
dose as well as after dermal application is considered relevant. Extensive non-clinical information on 
the pharmacological activity of ruxolitinib evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo following oral 
administration had already been assessed previously during the registration procedure of the medicinal 
product Jakavi, tablets. To evaluate the pharmacology activity of topical ruxolitinib in view of the 
proposed indication vitiligo, the applicant performed a new in vitro study using activated human CD8+ 
T-cell and melanocyte cultures and new in vivo studies using preclinical mice models of dermatitis. In 
addition, previously assessed in vivo studies using mouse models of inflammatory disease (IL-23 
induced psoriasis and dorsal delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) were submitted. Information from 
literature presenting the pharmacological activity of ruxolitinib in a mouse model of vitiligo following 
oral administration was also provided. 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Literature showed that ruxolitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases. 
JAK signalling involves activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to recruitment of STATs (signal 
transducers and activators of transcription) to cytokine receptors, and subsequent modulation of gene 
expression. According to literature data, IFNγ-driven inflammation in vitiligo is JAK-mediated. Activated 
CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ which trigger more CXCL9 and CXCL10 production through JAK1 and JAK2 
signalling and recruit more CD8+ T-cells to the inflammatory sites. CD8+ T-cells then destruct 
melanocytes and lead to depigmentation.  
In enzyme-based assays at a cellular concentration of ATP (1 mM), the potency of ruxolitinib against 
human JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) was demonstrated by the following mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 18/152 
 
 
 
IC50 values: 3.3 ± 1.2 nM for JAK1, 2.8 ± 1.2 nM for JAK2, 19 ± 3.2 nM for TYK2 and 428 ± 243 nM 
for JAK3.  
In cell-based assays, ruxolitinib potently inhibited IL-6, TPO or GM-CSF stimulated phosphorylation of 
STAT3 in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and primary human neutrophils 
at a concentration lower than 100 nM. It also inhibited the IL-23 stimulated production of IL-22,a 
cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple auto-immune inflammatory disease, in primary 
human T-cells with an IC50 value of 50 nM. By using human whole blood, where serum protein binding 
can be a significant factor, exogenous ruxolitinib blocked TPO or IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation 
with IC50 values of 281 nM and 280 nM. In addition, ruxolitinib inhibited IL-6 stimulated STAT3 
phosphorylation in whole blood from dogs (IC50 = 119 nM), rats (IC50 = 95 nM) and rabbits (IC50 = 
600 nM), confirming that ruxolitinib is pharmacologically active in human test systems and across the 
different species used in toxicology studies.  
In vitro assay using activated human CD8+ T-cell and melanocyte cultures showed the implication of 
IFN-γ/CXCL10 signalling pathway in conditions resembling vitiligo. Activated CD8+ T-cell conditioned 
media contained increased immune mediators, including IFNγ, IL-2, CXCL10 and Granzyme B, as also 
documented in literature. Subsequent CD8+ -cell conditioned media transfer to primary melanocytes 
resulted in rapid, and sustained, inhibition of spontaneous proliferation. Subsequent analysis of the 
melanocyte culture supernatants revealed a distinct inflammatory cytokine profile, including IL-6, 
CXCL10 and IL-8, induced by activated CD8+ T-cell conditioned media. Ruxolitinib significantly reduced 
the levels of T-cell derived cytokines, normalised melanocyte proliferation and ameliorated the 
melanocyte inflammatory milieu (Figure 3). These results were consistent with the observation that a 
dose-dependent reduction of circulating CXCL10 concentrations in vitiligo patients was associated with 
ruxolitinib cream treatment.

conditioned media and the effect of ruxolitinib 
Multiple cytokines, including IL-6, CXCL10, and IL-8 were significantly increased following the treatment of conditioned media. 
Importantly, ruxolitinib ameliorated this inflammatory response at the 1 μM and 100 nM concentrations tested.  
Legend: 
Literature data on a mouse model of vitiligo confirm the role of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in promoting the 
elimination of melanocytes and the implication of IFN-γ signalling through JAKs which appears to be 
necessary for depigmentation in vitiligo and show a potency of oral ruxolitinib to reverse inflammatory 
condition in vitiligo. In addition, autoreactive tissue resident T cells secreting IFN-γ have been 
described in lesional vitiligo skin of mouse model and these cells could be responsible for disease 
relapse (Azzolino et al, 2021). 
In vivo studies conducted by the applicant evaluated the pharmacological activity of topically applied 
ruxolitinib in mouse models relevant to the pathogenesis of dermatological conditions other than 
vitiligo (i.e. thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-induced acute dermatitis mouse model, a fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)- induced chronic dermatitis mouse model, spontaneous IL-33 transgenic mouse 
dermatitis model, IL-23 induced psoriasis mouse model, delayed-type hypersensitivity mouse model). 
Despite phenotypic differences in the inflammatory mediators responsible for driving disease 
pathogenesis of aforementioned dermatological conditions, all these models are characterised by 
increased inflammatory mediators that signal through the JAK-STAT pathway, T-helper and/or T-
cytotoxic cells. In vivo pharmacology studies showed that ruxolitinib 1.5% topical cream was 
efficacious in these mouse models. Ruxolitinib downregulated inflammatory pathways which was 
associated with inhibition of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes and their related proinflammatory cytokines. It 
reduced ear swelling, infiltration of T-cells, normalised tissue histology and alleviated pruritic 
behaviours (Figure 5, Figure 6).

As regards ruxolitinib metabolites, human metabolites as well as metabolites from rats, rabbits and 
dogs were found to be pharmacologically active. The potencies of human metabolites analysed in vitro 
were lower than that of the parent compound in an enzyme assay for JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 as well as 
IL-6 dependent INA-6 cell proliferation assay and human whole blood IL-6 activated STAT3 
phosphorylation assay. The two major metabolites identified, INCB040920 (M18) and INCB040341 
(M16), were ~3-5-fold less potent than the parent in this assay.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Ruxolitinib was evaluated against a panel of 30 kinases at 0.2 µM concentration, using the respective 
Km concentrations of ATP for each individual kinase. Under these conditions, ruxolitinib demonstrated 
no significant inhibition, with the exception for JAK2 and JAK 3 kinases. In addition, ruxolitinib did not 
demonstrate significant cross reactivity against tested receptors, channels and transporters at 0.1 and 
1 µM.

2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Ruxolitinib was also evaluated in a safety pharmacology core battery studies during the MAA of Jakavi 
(EMEA/H/C/002464): CNS and respiratory studies in the rat, a cardiovascular study in telemeterised 
conscious dogs, and in an in vitro hERG channel assay. There were two treatment-related adverse 
findings: decreases in minute volume in female rats given a single oral dose of 150 mg/kg (NOAEL 
50mg/kg) in a respiratory assessment of ruxolitinib; and decreases in arterial blood pressure along 
with increases in heart rate in radiotelemetry-implanted conscious dogs dosed 30 mg/kg (NOAEL 
10mg/kg). Main findings of adverse events on vital functions in rat and dogs following oral 
administration of ruxolitinib have been reflected in SmPC, section 5.3. Considering the limited systemic 
exposure of ruxolitinib following topical administration, the applicant considered that the potential for 
ruxolitinib to cause adverse alterations in respiratory and cardiovascular systems in humans was very 
low. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. Due to lack of the drug-drug interaction studies, the 
concomitant use of ruxolitinib cream and any other drug in the same treatment area is not 
recommended (see SmPC, section 4.5). 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib has been studied in vitro and in vivo in non-clinical models. 
Information on oral dose as well as after dermal application is provided using mice (CD-1, hairless and 
transgenic), rats (non-pigmented and pigmented), rabbits, dogs, monkeys and minipigs. The systemic 
exposure from ruxolitinib 1.5% cream may overlap with that from orally administered ruxolitinib, and 
therefore, non-clinical information from oral dose as well as after dermal application is considered 
relevant. Extensive non-clinical information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
following single oral dose administration of ruxolitinib to various species had already been assessed 
previously during registration of Jakavi medicinal product, tablets. Repeated dermal dose studies with 
ruxolitinib were performed in minipigs to evaluate the absorption and distribution of topical 
formulation. These include previously assessed dermal distribution study with 14C-INCB018424 and 
new PK study with ruxolitinib for determination of the systemic exposure and skin tissue distribution of 
ruxolitinib after topical vs. oral administration. Analytical assays that were used to characterise the 
non-clinical PK and toxicokinetic studies were thoroughly assessed and accepted as part of MAA for 
Jakavi medicinal product.   
Absorption 
Following single dermal administration of ruxolitinib, the mean skin flux of ruxolitinib was similar for 
solubilised and dispersed cream formulations (44 ng/cm2/h and 50 ng/cm2/h) with a bioavailability of 
1.8% and 3.0%, respectively. 
Repeated dose study (4 consecutive days of treatment) was conducted to evaluate the systemic 
exposure and skin distribution of ruxolitinib following oral vs. topical administration in 4 minipigs (oral 
40 mg/kg BID; topical 4.5 mg/cm2 (1.5%) cream BID applied to 10 % BSA) showed that the average 
steady state dermis concentration of ruxolitinib after topical administration was 507-fold higher 
compared to dermis concentrations following oral dosing, while the corresponding ratio for the 
epidermal sections was 1989- fold. Thus, compared to oral dosing, topical administration delivered 
ruxolitinib more effectively to the targeted skin layers with a lower systemic exposure as compared to 
oral administration. At 96 h post-dose, the mean Cmax of oral ruxolitinib and topical ruxolitinib was

153 nM and 4 nM, Tmax 3.3 h and 3.5 h, AUC0-12 1060 nM*h and 35 nM*h, respectively (Table 1). 
There was a wide range of variation among data in male and female minipigs. In female minipigs 
(N=2), the plasma AUC and Cmax values following topical administration were 40-50-fold lower than 
those observed by oral administration, while in male minipigs (N=2), AUC and Cmax were ∼20 fold 
lower after topical administration compared to oral administration. The sample size is considered by 
the applicant to be too small to draw valid conclusions on potential gender differences in ruxolitinib 
systemic exposure following topical application in minipigs and to estimate its clinical relevance.

Distribution 
Distribution studies following topical administration of ruxolitinib were conducted in minipig (N=1) with 
radiolabelled compound (14C INCB018424). Results of auto-radioluminography showed that after 4 
daily dermal doses of 1% [14C]-ruxolitinib cream distribution of radioactivity in skin was generally 
limited to the upper layers of the tissue. The highest concentration was associated with a pigmented 
layer of cells found in the epidermis, probably composed of keratinocytes and melanocytes. Lower 
levels were observed in the epidermis above this layer of cells and in the stratum corneum. Levels in 
the dermis (below the pigmented layer) and hypodermis (sub-cutis) were below the lower limit of 
quantitation. These data suggest non-specific melanin binding and necessity for assessment of 
phototoxicity.  
Distribution studies were conducted also in non-pigmented and pigmented rats with radiolabelled 
compound 14C-ruxolitinib (200 μCi/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats and 100 μCi/kg in Long-Evans rats) 
administered orally. Distribution was wide and rapid in non-pigmented and pigmented rats with the 
highest concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, renal cortex, renal medulla, liver, 
aorta, and adrenal gland. In pigmented rats, the highest concentrations of radioactivity were observed 
in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by urine, bile, uveal tract, liver, renal medulla, renal cortex, skin 
(pigmented), and kidney. Elimination in pigmented rats was rapid in most tissues (below the limit of 
quantitation at 24 h), with no matrix or tissue containing detectable levels of ruxolitinib-derived 
radioactivity by 336 h post-dose. Based on the elimination from skin and uveal tract, ruxolitinib-
derived radioactivity was not irreversibly bound to melanin. Penetration of ruxolitinib and ruxolitinib-
derived radioactivity into central nervous system tissues was limited (less than 10% of plasma 
concentration). In pregnant rats that received a single oral dose of 30 mg/50 μCi/kg 14C ruxolitinib, the 
maximum maternal blood and plasma concentrations were at 1 h post-dose and declined to low levels 
(approximately 1% of Cmax) by 24 h post-dose. In whole foetuses and all foetal tissues, 
concentrations of radioactivity by 8 h post-dose were below the quantitation limit or not detectable.

The foetus:maternal plasma concentration ratio and foetal tissue: maternal plasma concentration 
ratios were less than one for all foetal tissues indicating that foetal exposure was limited.  
The plasma protein binding of ruxolitinib was species dependent. Results from oral 14C studies 
indicated minor to no preferential partitioning of ruxolitinib-derived radioactivity into blood cells of 
mice, rats, dogs and humans. The mean dermal unbound fractions in minipigs at 74 and 96 hours were 
11.2% and 19.4%, respectively. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism of ruxolitinib was investigated using rat liver microsomes and recombinant rat 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Ruxolitinib was metabolised by the male rat-specific isozymes 
CYP2C11, CYP2C13 and CYP3A2, but not the female rat specific CYP2C12 isozyme. Ruxolitinib was also 
metabolised by isozymes found in both female and male rats including CYP1A2, CYP2C6 and CYP2D1. 
In vitro metabolism studies using recombinant human cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and human liver 
microsomes in the presence and absence of selective chemical inhibitors show that CYP3A4 is the 
predominant human CYP isozyme responsible for the metabolism of ruxolitinib and to a lesser extent is 
metabolised by CYP2C9. The in vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that ruxolitinib and its 
major human metabolite M18 are not expected to inhibit cytochromes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 and is unlikely to cause clinical drug interactions. Ruxolitinib 
also appears to have a very low potential to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes at clinically 
relevant concentrations.  
The in vivo metabolic profile of ruxolitinib was investigated in CbyB6F1HyBrid mice, CD-1 mice, rats, 
minipigs, rabbits, beagle dogs. In general, the metabolite profiles in non-clinical species and humans 
were similar and consisted of various hydroxylation and ketone metabolites and subsequent 
glucuronide conjugates. In mice and dogs that were administered oral ruxolitinib, parent compound 
was the primary component in circulation, while in rats and rabbits, metabolites are the predominant 
entities. The primary clearance pathway was via metabolism with the predominant metabolic pathways 
in mice, rat and dog being mono- and di-oxygenation. In mice, dogs, minipigs there were minimal 
gender differences in the exposure of ruxolitinib and its metabolites. In general, the metabolite profiles 
and excretion patterns in non-clinical species were similar to those observed in human. The 
toxicokinetics of eight metabolites previously observed in human plasma after oral dosing were 
evaluated in plasma from mice, rats and dogs administered at NOAEL oral doses. The results showed 
that human metabolites were adequately assessed in the toxicology studies conducted in mice, rats, 
and dogs.  
Excretion 
Following a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg 14C-ruxolitinib in bile-cannulated female SD rats, elimination 
of INCB018424-derived radioactivity occurred via the urine, bile and faeces, accounting for an average 
of 45%, 40% and 20% of the administered dose, respectively. The excretion was rapid, 40% of 
administered dose was recovered from urine within 8 h, 37% from bile within 8 h and 19% from faeces 
within 24 h. The total recovery was 106% of the dose. 
Following a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg 14C-ruxolitinib in beagle dogs, routes of excretion and rate of 
elimination were similar in males and females with 82.4% and 79.7% of the dose excreted within 24 h 
of dosing, respectively. In males and females, 55% and 58% of the administered doses were 
recovered from faeces and 34% and 36% were recovered from urine.  
After oral administration of 30 mg/kg 14C-ruxolitinib to lactating rats, peak radioactivity concentrations 
occurred at 1-hour post-dose in plasma and blood and at 2 hours post-dose in milk. The milk:plasma 
concentration ratios ranged from 4.02 to 24.8 (13.4 based on AUC0-∞), indicating that 14C-INCB018424- 
related radioactivity preferentially partitioned into milk of rats. After reaching maximum 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 25/152 
 
 
 
concentrations, the radioactivity in blood, plasma, and milk declined through 24 hours. The elimination 
half-lives of radioactivity in blood, plasma, and milk were similar at 2.22, 2.19, and 2.93 hours, 
respectively. After reaching peak concentration at 2 hours post-dose, concentrations of radioactivity 
associated with 14C-INCB018424 in milk declined in parallel with plasma concentrations with no 
accumulation of radioactivity in the maternal milk indicating that accumulation of radioactivity in the 
maternal milk is likely to be minimal, according to the applicant. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. Ruxolitinib interaction with systemic drugs after topical 
administration would be limited by the limited absorption. In addition, based on the available in vitro 
data, ruxolitinib appeared not to be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP enzymes. Therefore, the effect of 
ruxolitinib on other drugs via cytochrome P450 enzymes is considered to be unlikely by the applicant.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Ruxolitinib was evaluated for potential toxicity following oral and dermal administration. As systemic 
exposure from ruxolitinib 1.5% cream may overlap with that from orally administered ruxolitinib, the 
non-clinical information from oral dosing as well as after dermal application is considered relevant. 
Extensive non-clinical information on toxicology of ruxolitinib following oral administration had already 
been assessed and accepted previously during registration of the medicinal product Jakavi tablets 
(EMEA/H/C/002464). To evaluate the safety profile of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream for treatment of vitiligo, 
the applicant performed dermal single and repeat dose toxicity studies in mice and Göttingen minipigs, 
an in vitro photoclastogenicity study, a dermal 2-year mouse and an oral 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study, and a series of local tolerance studies in mice, rabbit, and hairless albino guinea pigs. For topical 
studies, the cream formulation used was the same as the clinical ruxolitinib cream formulation. Test 
articles for all GLP studies were appropriately characterised with respect to identity, strength, purity, 
and composition. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
All oral single dose studies were part of the dossier of Jakavi (EMEA/H/C/002464). A dermal single 
dose study in Göttingen Minipigs was performed to support the ruxolitinib cream formulation. 
Ruxolitinib was well tolerated following single oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg in rats and 40 mg/kg in 
dogs, and in male and female minipigs, dosed topically once with 1.5% cream on 25 cm2 test area 
(Table 2).

2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Oral toxicity studies 
The toxicity profile of ruxolitinib following oral administration has been assessed in rats and dogs for up 
to 6 months and 1 year, respectively, during the MAA procedure of Jakavi (EMEA/H/C/002464). Oral 
repeat dose toxicity studies are summarised in Table 3.  
The most common findings in oral repeat dose studies in mice, rats and dogs were expected based on 
the pharmacological effects of JAK inhibition: decreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils, reticulocytes, red 
blood cell count, haemoglobin and haematocrit as well as hypocellularity of the bone marrow and 
lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, GALT). All changes demonstrated varying degrees of 
reversibility when dosing was discontinued. 
In the oral rat 6-month study, a finding not clearly associated with the pharmacology of JAK1/2 
inhibition was the minimal adrenal cortical atrophy at the highest dose administered, 60 mg/kg/day, 
which was not observed in other species. 
In the dog, findings not clearly related to pharmacology of ruxolitinib were gastrointestinal (GI) 
inflammation in the 4-week oral study and prostatic hypoplasia in the 6-month study. GI inflammation 
was not found in longer studies and is therefore not deemed relevant by the applicant. The prostatic 
hypoplasia was not accompanied by any changes to testis or spermatogenesis and did not occur in the 
12-month study under similar exposures.

Dermal toxicity studies 
Repeat dose dermal toxicity studies with ruxolitinib in mice and minipigs, were performed in support of 
topical formulation. No additional toxicities were identified in dermal studies with ruxolitinib as 
compared to oral route, as most effects observed were secondary to the pharmacological effect. 
To support the study design and dose selection for a dermal carcinogenicity study, the toxicity of 
ruxolitinib was evaluated in CD-1 mice after dermal application for up to 3 months. The toxicity of 
ruxolitinib after dermal application was evaluated in Gottingen minipigs for up to 9 months. Doses and 
study designs for pivotal studies were based on results of preliminary 7-day studies where no evidence 
of systemic toxicity or significant dermal findings were observed. The cream formulation used in the 
pivotal GLP studies was the same as the clinical formulation. The excipients contained in the drug 
product are well known, commonly used in the manufacture of medicinal products intended for 
cutaneous use and of the Ph. Eur. quality, except for glyceryl stearate SE.  
The findings associated with dermal application of ruxolitinib to mice for 28 days were increased 
neutrophils and monocytes in males administered 1.0% w/w BID to 10% BSA, and increased 
monocytes in males administered 1.5% w/w BID to 10% BSA. Severe dermal findings leading to 
euthanasia of one male mouse administered 1.5% BID were considered of uncertain relationship to 
ruxolitinib by the applicant. 
Dermal application of ruxolitinib to mice for 90 consecutive days resulted in reductions of body weight 
in males administered 1.5% w/w BID to 10% BSA. Decreases in total leukocytes and lymphocyte 
counts and decreases in erythrocytes and haemoglobin were observed. Absolute lymphocyte count was 
decreased to 59 – 56% of the respective control group value. Margins (based on unbound AUC) at 
non-adverse levels were approximately 10-fold in male and 24-fold in female mice relative to systemic 
exposure observed in patients with vitiligo that applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily. Erythrocytes 
were reduced in both sexes at 1.5% BID, but did not reach statistical significance in the females, 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 29/152 
 
 
 
 
although haematocrit was statistically decreased in the females at 1.5% BID. Haemoglobin was 
decreased dose-dependently in males and females receiving 1.0% and 1.5% BID. Although these 
changes appeared to be dose-dependent, values remained within normal ranges and were therefore 
not considered adverse. One female dosed 1.5% BID was euthanised in extremis due to pulmonary 
inflammation; the relationship of this single finding to the test article is unclear. 
In the 9-month dermal study in minipigs, decreases to 40-60% of the baseline in lymphocytes 
occurred in all ruxolitinib-treated groups. Because there were no associated microscopic findings of 
lymphoid depletion, these were considered non-adverse in the absence of any other findings 
suggestive of systemic toxicity. Dermal findings at the application site, including hyperkeratosis, 
epidermal hyperplasia, erosions, and ulcerations, were generally mild. Epidermal hyperkeratosis and 
hyperplasia did not show a clear dose response, whereas erosions and ulcerations were most common 
in the 1.5% w/w BID applied to 10% BSA group. Hence, the systemic NOAEL was identified as the high 
dose, 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID, while the dermal NOAEL was identified as the mid dose, 1.0% cream 
BID. Systemic ruxolitinib exposures were low, consistent with PK studies in minipigs where 
bioavailability following dermal application was approximately 3%: 1.5% ruxolitinib when applied 
dermally twice daily to 10% BSA at an application rate of 10 mg/cm2 was associated with Day 293 
AUC0-24 of 167 nM·h in males, and 219 ± 116 nM·h in females. Unbound fraction in minipigs is 10-fold 
higher than in humans. Consequently, the exposures in minipigs were 3-fold the expected exposure at 
human therapeutic dosage. 
This effect was not observed in the 13-week study, which may indicate that the effect is dependent on 
the duration of the treatment. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant included this information in section 
5.3. of the SmPC.

2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Ruxolitinib was negative in the Ames assay, in the in vitro chromosomal aberrations test with cultured 
human blood and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay but was positive for inducing 
chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells with UV exposure (Table 5).  
Although the in vitro photoclastogenicity assay may be oversensitive (and is therefore not 
recommended for regulatory purposes), ruxolitinib is known to absorb UV light, which may be of 
concern. However, the photoclastogenicity would stem from the generation of reactive oxygen species 
due to photoinstability, and the applicant has shown that UV or visible light absorption does not lead to 
significant photodegradation of ruxolitinib. The photoirritation and photoallergy test results showed no 
adverse effects of ruxolitinib in albino hairless guinea pigs. Furthermore, apart from some irritation 
under occlusive application, no adverse dermal findings consistent with photoreactivity, phototoxicity 
or photoallergy have been observed in clinical studies under exaggerated conditions (INCB 18424-104, 
INCB 18424- 105, INCB 18424-106, INCB 18424- 107, INCB 18424-108). 
Although photoclastogenicity cannot be definitively excluded, results of photostability, nonclinical in 
vivo phototoxicity studies and clinical dermal safety studies indicate that ruxolitinib is not 
photoreactive.

Ruxolitinib was evaluated for potential carcinogenicity following oral administration in rats for 2 years 
and Tg.rasH2 mice for 6 months, and following dermal administration of ruxolitinib cream to CD-1 mice 
Assessment report

for 2 years (Table 6). The Tg.rasH2 mice for 6 months study has already been assessed as part of 
Jakavi registrational procedure (EMEA/H/C/002464).  
There were some neoplastic findings in the 2-year mice dermal carcinogenicity study. In males, there 
was a statistically significant increase in the incidence (dose dependence) of adenoma in the kidneys 
when compared to placebo control, but not when compared to untreated control. There was a 
statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant lymphoma when compared to untreated 
control, but not when compared to placebo control. There was also a statistically significant increase in 
the incidence of malignant lymphoma when comparing the high dose level with untreated control (15 
males vs. 3 males in groups of 60). In females, there was a statistically significant increase in the 
incidence of systemic hemangiosarcoma when comparing the low dose level with placebo control (11 
females vs. 2 females in groups of 60), but not when comparing mid or high dose level with either 
control groups.  
Exposure levels achieved with topical application of 1.5% QD in 2-year mice carcinogenicity study were 
0.064 and 0.073 µM·h (M, F, unbound), which is 3.0-3.5-fold the exposure expected in humans after 
dermal use of ruxolitinib. 
Due to the absence of statistical significance when comparing to both control groups and absence of a 
dose-response with hemangiosarcoma in females, these statistically significant variations were 
considered by the applicant to be incidental changes unrelated to test article administration. Although 
these results are seemingly inconsistent, a comparison with historical data for CD-1 mice would have 
been beneficial. There are some indications that JAK inhibitors may cause malignancies when taken 
orally in clinical use and the exposure after topical administration is overlapping with exposure after 
oral administration, therefore, the applicant was asked to further discuss the occurrence of kidney 
adenoma, malignant lymphoma and haemangiosarcoma. As noted by the applicant, in oral studies 
there was no increase in these, or related tumours in rats, and no ruxolitinib-related neoplasia in 
Tg.rasH2 mice despite achieving 10-fold (rat) and 30-fold (Tg.rasH2 mouse) higher exposures than in 
the dermal mouse study. 
In dermal mouse study, although there was a statistically significant trend in the incidence of adenoma 
in the kidneys in males when compared to placebo control, there were no statistically significant 
differences in pairwise comparisons with the placebo control, and a similar trend was not observed 
when compared to the untreated control. The incidence in high dose males was similar to that in the 
untreated control, suggesting this reflected background variability. There were also no findings of 
kidney adenoma in females. 
The haemangiosarcoma incidence in low dose (0.5%) female mice was significant when compared to 
the placebo control, but not when compared to the untreated control. No statistically significant 
differences were found in male groups compared with untreated or placebo control. This can be 
explained with the incidence of haemangiosarcoma in the placebo control females being notably lower 
than in untreated controls and in the placebo control males. Further, the incidence of this finding was 
similar in males and females across all treated groups with no dose-response. Therefore, the increased 
incidence of haemangiosarcoma in low dose females relative to the placebo control group can be 
explained by intergroup variability and the low incidence in the placebo control group and cannot be 
attributed to ruxolitinib cream. 
Lymphoma is a common background tumour in CD-1 mice. There was a statistically significant 
increasing trend in the incidence of lymphoma in males when compared to untreated control, but not 
when compared with placebo control. There was a statistically significant higher incidence of the 
tumour when comparing the high dose level with untreated control. Among the unscheduled deaths in 
males for which lymphoma was the cause of death, there were no apparent trends in the days of 
death, suggesting no difference in onset or progression of lymphoma in these groups that may suggest 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 33/152 
 
 
 
an effect of ruxolitinib cream. There was no evidence of an increase in lymphoma in female mice, and 
the incidence in both female control groups were notably higher than in male control groups. 
Collectively, these results indicate that the higher incidence of malignant lymphoma in high dose males 
is most likely due to intergroup variability in the incidence of this common tumour and was not 
associated with administration of ruxolitinib cream. 
Common neoplasms observed in the rats in the 2-year rat oral carcinogenicity study were consistent 
with spontaneous neoplasms in aging laboratory rats and were not related to administration of 
ruxolitinib. Exposure levels achieved at 60 mg/kg in present study were 0.538 and 4.27 µM·h (M, F, 
unbound), which is 4.7-37.1-fold the exposure expected in humans after dermal use of ruxolitinib. The 
lower exposure in males may be due to faster metabolism in males of ruxolitinib in this species, 
therefore the margin of exposure may be underestimated. 
No malignancies were detected in the 6-month Tg.rasH2 mice carcinogenicity study. Exposure levels 
achieved at 125 mg/kg were 3.32 and 3.82 µM·h (M, F, unbound), which is 158-182-fold the exposure 
expected in humans after dermal use of ruxolitinib. 
The applicant considered that non-clinical data do not suggest that ruxolitinib cream is carcinogenic in 
animals.

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental studies were presented during the marketing authorisation procedure 
for ruxolitinib tablets Jakavi (EMEA/H/C/002464). Studies performed with oral ruxolitinib 
administration are described in the Table 7 below. 
In a fertility study in rats, oral ruxolitinib had no effects on male fertility or on oestrus cycling, mating 
or fertility indices in females. However, an increase in post-implantation loss was observed at 30 and 
60 mg/kg per day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 34/152 
 
 
 
 
In embryofoetal development studies in rats and rabbits, increased resorptions and decreased foetal 
weight were observed at maternally toxic doses (≥ 30 mg/kg/day). In rabbits, an increased number of 
malformations were noted in animals treated with ruxolitinib, but not in the control group. 
Hydrocephaly was noted in one foetus and umbilical hernias were noted in two foetuses from separate 
litters from dams given 60 mg/kg/day, which was associated with maternal toxicity. An unossified 
pubis was also noted in one foetus at this high dose. Incidental skeletal malformations included fused 
ribs in one 10 mg/kg/day foetus, fused thoracic centra in two 10 mg/kg/day foetuses from one litter 
and fused ribs and thoracic centrum in one 30 mg/kg/day foetus. 
In rat, the exposure at NOAEL (30 mg/kg per day) was approximately 25.5-fold of that in vitiligo 
patients during clinical trials. At NOAEL (30 mg/kg per day) the exposure in rabbit was only 0.42-fold 
of that in vitiligo patients during clinical trials. In rabbits, low plasma ruxolitinib exposure was 
attributed to extensive metabolism to active metabolites. Thus, plasma ruxolitinib levels may not 
reflect the level of pharmacologic activity in rabbits. 
Following maternal oral administration during gestation and lactation in rats in the pre- and postnatal 
study, ruxolitinib had no effect on postnatal survival, developmental milestones, behavioural or 
reproductive function in offspring. Birth weight was slightly lower, and a transient decrease in postnatal 
body weight gain during the early lactation period was observed at 30 mg/kg per day. 
Orally administered ruxolitinib to juvenile rats beginning on Day 7, 14 or 21 postpartum caused 
reductions in body weight gain and effects on bone measures. These findings were more severe in 
males than in females, and when dosing was initiated at an earlier age. The relationship of these 
findings to ruxolitinib pharmacology, and translation to humans is unclear, however the rat may not be 
a representative model for this effect. The difference is that the juvenile rat skeleton is predominantly 
a modelling skeleton, while in humans remodelling is more important in bone formation, because the 
average bone tissue age in a 20-year growth period in humans exceeds the osteocyte-life span. 
The juvenile animal toxicity study results elicited a safety concern for the use of ruxolitinib in paediatric 
subjects. Effects on bone growth were observed at exposures approximately 22-fold (start of dosing at 
PND7) and 35-fold (start of dosing at PND21) of those in vitiligo patients during clinical trials. Also, 
none of the effects on the bone seen in the juvenile animal study was seen in adolescent rats and dogs 
in repeat dose toxicity studies.  
Animal data suggest that ruxolitinib is preferentially partitioned into milk. In the rat study with 14C-
INCB018424, the milk:plasma concentration ratios ranged from 4.02 to 24.8 (13.4-fold, based on 
AUC0-∞) (DMB-10.50.1). As the data on juvenile toxicity indicate possible bone development effects in 
early postnatal development, and the treatment can be postponed, it was decided that ruxolitinib 
cream should be contraindicated during breastfeeding and treatment must be discontinued 
approximately four weeks before the beginning of breastfeeding. The applicant has agreed to update 
the SmPC section 4.6 accordingly.

Ruxolitinib exposures in dermal repeated dose toxicity studies at the NOAEL in mice (1.0% QD) and 
minipigs (1.5% BID), were 9.3 – 24-fold (mouse) and 2.6 – 3.4-fold (minipig), respectively, the 
expected exposure (steady-state AUC0-24, unbound) at the human therapeutic dosage. 
The ex vivo fraction unbound in plasma is 4.9% in Tg.rasH2 mice, 2.7% in CD-1 mice, 18% in rats, 
13% in rabbits, 9.7% in beagle dogs, and 33% in Gottingen minipigs. In vitro fraction unbound in 
human plasma is 3.3%.

a Safety margins were calculated as the multiple of AUC0-24h at the NOAEL relative to steady state AUC0-24h in vitiligo patients that 
applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream BID to up to 10% BSA in INCB 18424-306 and INCB 18424-307, calculated as Css (geometric mean; 26.6 
nM, average of 24 and 40 week) × 24. (638 nM·h total; 21 nM·h unbound) (Module 2.7.2.2.3.2.2). 
b The ex vivo fraction unbound in plasma is 4.9% in Tg.rasH2 mice, 2.7% in CD-1 mice, 18% in rats, 13% in rabbits, 9.7% in beagle dogs, and 33% 
in Gottingen minipigs. In vitro fraction unbound in human plasma is 3.3%. 
c Highest dose tested 
d Ruxolitinib exposure in male rats and rabbits is not reflective of total pharmacologic activity because of extensive metabolism to active 
metabolites. Thus, safety margins for pharmacology-driven effects are likely underestimated. 
e Toxicokinetics were not included in the fertility study. AUC from 60 mg/kg per day in 6-month study in rats. 
f  NOAEL was 60 mg/kg per day female reproductive function and 10 mg/kg per day for early embryonic toxicity

Impurities 
Drug process starting materials, intermediates, and impurities were evaluated in a series of in silico 
platforms, and if they were predicted mutagenic, they were further evaluated in in vitro Ames test 
(TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA97a, and TA102). 
The Salmonella typhimurium strains were chosen according to the ICHS2(R1) guideline and Ames tests 
gave no positive result. 
Upon CHMP’s request, another 19 potential impurities were evaluated using Derek Nexus (v 6.1.0) and 
Sarah Nexus (v 3.1.0). 17 structures were assigned as ICH M7 Class 5 based on absence of a 
structural alert and will be treated as non-mutagenic impurities. Two structures, MS 305 and 
INCB042043, were positive in both Derek and Sarah with an alerting structure of potential alkylating 
agent and assigned ICH M7 Class 3. For all batches of ruxolitinib phosphate drug substance tested, the 
two impurities were not detected at or above the method detection limit of 1 ppm. Thus, the potential 
exposure is below the acceptable threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) for mutagenic impurities 
based on maximum recommended use. Therefore, none of these compounds needed to be further 
tested for mutagenicity. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A full Phase I, Phase IIA and partial Phase IIB assessment was performed. All ERA studies were 
conducted in compliance with GLP. 
The mean log KOW (log Dow) octanol-water partition coefficient of ruxolitinib phosphate was 
determined to be 2.3 to 2.6 (pH 4); 2.3 to 2.4 (pH 7) and 2.5 to 3.0 (pH 9). Mean values from all 
three assays are below the criteria for the evaluation of secondary poisoning, hence tier B for 
secondary poisoning was not triggered. Ruxolitinib is not a persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic (PBT) 
substance since the octanol-water distribution coefficient (log DOW) is <4.5.  
Ruxolitinib is not readily biodegradable. In water-sediment systems, 14Cruxolitinib dissipates from the 
water phase mainly via binding to sediment (bound residues) and the formation of a major 
transformation product (TP1) and a number of minor transformation products. 
Koc in three soils and both sludges was <10,000 mL/g, therefore, 14Cruxolitinib phosphate will not 
strongly adsorb to activated sludge or soil. According to the McCall classification scale, 14Cruxolitinib 
phosphate can be classified (based on KOC) as having immobility in the soils. 
The DT50 value for 14Cruxolitinib phosphate in the total water/sediment test system for Taunton River 
and Weweantic River aerobic and test systems were determined to be 418 and 761 days at 12 oC, 
respectively. The total system half-life (DT50) at 12 oC ranged from 344 to 527 days; based on DT50 
>180 days, ruxolitinib is very persistent (vP) in aquatic systems according to the OECD 308 study. 
Also, in the water-sediment study, > 10% of the radioactivity was present in the sediment within 14

days. Hence, the applicant performed the Phase II Tier B OECD  218 study in sediment dwelling midge 
Chironimus riparius (see Table 10). 
PECsurfacewater of 0.43 μg/L was calculated using the default FPEN of 0.01, which is acceptable for this 
marketing application. 
The PNECs for surface water, groundwater, microorganisms in a sewage treatment plant, and 
sediments were 30.4 μg/L, 61.5 μg/L, 1139 μg/L, and 3.63 mg/kg dw, respectively. 
RCR (PEC/PNEC) for surface water, groundwater, microorganisms, and sediments were all below the 
respective trigger values, therefore no adverse environmental effects to the aquatic environment are 
anticipated as a consequence of therapeutic use of ruxolitinib phosphate cream (1.5%) for the topical 
treatment of vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Ruxolitinib phosphate is a topical formulation that proposed for the treatment of non-segmental 
vitiligo. The potency of ruxolitinib to inhibit Janus kinases (JAK), that mediate the signalling of several 
cytokines and growth factors that are important for haematopoiesis and immune function, has already 
been described in the literature. Extensive non-clinical information on the pharmacological activity of 
ruxolitinib evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo following orally administration has already been 
assessed previously during the evaluation of Jakavi (EMEA/H/C/002464), tablets. These studies were 
deemed acceptable.

Pharmacology 
Submitted in vitro enzyme and cellular studies indicate that ruxolitinib is a selective inhibitor of JAK 1 
and JAK 2 kinases. The primary human metabolites exhibit similar potency compared to ruxolitinib in 
the enzyme and cellular assays. Based on the in vitro results, no secondary pharmacodynamic action is 
expected due to binding to non-specific receptors/kinases. New in vitro and in vivo studies submitted 
with the present application showed that ruxolitinib can reduce the levels of cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2, 
CXCL10 and Granzyme B) derived from in vitro activated CD8+ T cells and consequently normalise 
melanocyte proliferation and inflammatory response in CD8+ - conditioned media.  
In vivo, using mouse models of dermatitis driven by the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, topical 
administration of ruxolitinib cream significantly decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the 
skin, reduced dermatitis symptoms, reduced infiltration of Th1 and Th2 cells, normalised tissue 
histology and alleviated pruritic behaviour. Ruxolitinib was also evaluated in a safety pharmacology 
core battery studies during the MAA of Jakavi (EMEA/H/C/002464). Main findings of adverse events on 
vital functions (i.e., a significant decrease in minute volume in high dose rat females and lower values 
for arterial blood pressure in adult male conscious radiotelemetry-implanted Beagle dogs) following 
oral administration of ruxolitinib were not considered clinically relevant by the CHMP due to a large 
safety margin.  
Overall, the design, methods and conduct of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies are considered 
appropriate regarding the studies objectives. The selection of the in vitro cell culture model including 
melanocytes and CD8+ T cells is considered suitable to demonstrate the potency of ruxolitinib cream. 
The selected in vivo animal models in combination with in vitro test systems and literature data are 
considered relevant to draw valid conclusions on pharmacological activity of ruxolitinib for the intended 
therapeutic use in vitiligo. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant submitted data showing that, in contrast 
to the significant effects of ruxolitinib on proliferation in IL-2 activated T cells, up to 10 mM of 
ruxolitinib showed no effect on the survival of naïve T cells cultured without cytokine stimulation, which 
supported the selective role of ruxolitinib. In addition, the applicant submitted previously published 
work by Fridman et al 2011 in support to ruxolitinib potency to inhibit cytokine stimulated pSTAT3. In 
addition, the applicant provided a justification for conducting initial non-clinical studies in human test 
system and across species using STAT3 phosphorylation as a surrogate PD readout which is accepted. 
The applicant updated the report of in vitro experiments utilising human lymphocytes and melanocytes 
in support to the mechanism of action of ruxolitinib in vitiligo disease. The update provided involved 
the data for the third dose (0.01 μM). Based on the observed effects of ruxolitinib under selected in 
vitro conditions, the pharmacodynamic “proof of concept” for vitiligo condition is considered to be 
demonstrated. Updated information on mechanism of action in section 5.1 of SmPC is considered 
sufficient. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib has been studied in vitro and in vivo. Information on oral dose as 
well as after dermal application was provided using mice (CD-1, hairless and transgenic), rats (non-
pigmented and pigmented), rabbits, dogs, monkeys and minipigs. Extensive non-clinical information on 
the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion following single oral dose administration of 
ruxolitinib to various species had already been assessed previously during the iMAA of Jakavi, tablets 
(Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/002464). These studies were deemed acceptable. In addition, dermal repeat 
dose studies with ruxolitinib were evaluated in minipigs as being the most relevant animal model for 
dermal studies. Following repeat-dose dermal administration of ruxolitinib cream (40 mg/kg, BID), 
applied to 10% of body surface area, the mean plasma concentration at steady state was low (Css = 
2.7 nM). The plasma AUC and Cmax values after four consecutive days of treatment were 30- to 40- 
fold lower than those observed following oral administration in minipigs (i.e., 3.2% and 2.6 % of oral 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 42/152 
 
 
 
dose, respectively). Distribution studies in minipigs following repeat-dose topical administration of 
ruxolitinib revealed that ruxolitinib was generally limited to the upper layers of the skin. The highest 
concentration was associated with the pigmented layer in the epidermis. Levels in the dermis and 
hypodermis were below the limit of quantitation. Thus, compared to oral dosing, topical administration 
delivered ruxolitinib more effectively to the targeted skin layers while limiting systemic exposure.  
Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of orally administered ruxolitinib has been assessed during the MAA of Jakavi 
(EMEA/H/C/002464). These studies were deemed acceptable. As systemic exposure from ruxolitinib 
1.5% cream may overlap with that from orally administered ruxolitinib the non-clinical information 
from oral dosing as well as after dermal application is considered relevant. Single and repeat dose 
dermal toxicity studies in mice and minipigs, dermal 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, oral 2-year 
rat carcinogenicity study and local tolerance studies with ruxolitinib were performed in support of 
topical formulation. No additional toxicities were identified in dermal studies with ruxolitinib as 
compared to oral route, as most effects observed were secondary to the pharmacological effect: 
reductions in lymphocytes, eosinophils, reticulocytes, red blood cell count, haemoglobin and 
haematocrit as well as hypocellularity of the bone marrow and lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, 
lymph nodes, Peyer’s plate). All changes demonstrated varying degrees of reversibility when dosing 
was discontinued. 
Dermal repeat dose studies revealed systemic immunosuppressive effects in mice. Decreased 
peripheral lymphocyte counts were noted at all doses in minipigs in the 9-month study, which could 
indicate a systemic effect of ruxolitinib. This effect was not observed in the 13-week study, which may 
indicate that the effect is dependent on the duration of the treatment. The more prominent systemic 
effects seen in mice may be related to higher exposures achieved in mice in comparison to minipigs. 
However, minipigs are considered to be a more representative animal model as the skin of mice is 
thinner than that of pigs (and humans). 
Ruxolitinib exposures in dermal repeated dose toxicity studies at the NOAEL in mice (1.0% QD) and 
minipigs (1.5% BID), were 9.3 – 24-fold (mouse) and 2.6 – 3.4-fold (minipig) the expected exposure 
(steady-state AUC0-24, unbound) at the human therapeutic dose. Due to the low safety margins and 
upon request from the CHMP, immunosuppressive effect was included in the SmPC section 5.3. 
Ruxolitinib was negative in the Ames assay, in an in vitro chromosomal aberrations test with cultured 
human blood and in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay but was positive for inducing 
chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells with UV exposure. Although photoclastogenicity cannot be 
definitively excluded, results of photostability testing, nonclinical in vivo phototoxicity studies and 
clinical dermal safety studies indicate that ruxolitinib is not photoreactive. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that no additional precautions are necessary for ruxolitinib in the non-segmental vitiligo 
indication. 
Oral administration of ruxolitinib for 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats and for 6 months in Tg.rasH2 mice 
did not show any carcinogenic potential. Dermal 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice showed 
carcinogenic potential of ruxolitinib, as there may be an increase incidence of lymphoma and kidney 
adenomas in male mice and haemangiosarcoma in female mice. The results were inconsistent, 
nevertheless, upon CHMP’s request, the applicant thoroughly assessed these findings.  
The applicant has submitted an additional assessment of the malignancies observed in carcinogenicity 
studies. As noted by the applicant, in oral studies there was no increase in these, or related tumours in 
rats, and no ruxolitinib-related neoplasia were observed in Tg.rasH2 mice despite achieving 10-fold 
(rat) and 30-fold (Tg.rasH2 mouse) higher exposures than in the dermal mouse study.

In dermal mouse study, although there was a statistically significant trend in the incidence of adenoma 
in the kidneys in males when compared to placebo control, there were no statistically significant 
differences in pairwise comparisons with the placebo control, and a similar trend was not observed 
when compared to the untreated control. The incidence in high dose males was similar to that in the 
untreated control, suggesting this reflected background variability. There were also no findings of 
kidney adenoma in females. 
The haemangiosarcoma incidence in low dose (0.5%) female mice was significant when compared to 
the placebo control, but not when compared to the untreated control. No statistically significant 
differences were found in male groups compared with untreated or placebo control. This can be 
explained by the incidence of haemangiosarcoma in the placebo control females being notably lower 
than in untreated controls and in the placebo control males. Further, the incidence of this finding was 
similar in males and females across all treated groups with no dose-response. Therefore, the increased 
incidence of haemangiosarcoma in low dose females relative to the placebo control group can be 
explained by intergroup variability and the low incidence in the placebo control group and thus cannot 
be attributed to ruxolitinib cream. 
Lymphoma is a common background tumour in CD-1 mice. There was a statistically significant 
increasing trend in the incidence of lymphoma in males when compared to untreated control, but not 
when compared with placebo control. There was a statistically significant higher incidence of the 
tumour when comparing the high dose level with untreated control. Among the unscheduled deaths in 
males for which lymphoma was the cause of death, there were no apparent trends in the days of 
death, suggesting no difference in onset or progression of lymphoma in these groups that may suggest 
an effect of ruxolitinib cream. There was no evidence of an increase in lymphoma in female mice, and 
the incidence in both female control groups was notably higher than in male control groups. 
Collectively, these results indicate that the higher incidence of malignant lymphoma in high dose males 
is most likely due to intergroup variability in the incidence of this common tumour and was not 
associated with administration of ruxolitinib cream. 
Overall, the non-clinical data do not suggest that ruxolitinib cream is carcinogenic in animals. 
In the fertility study in rats, oral ruxolitinib had no effects on male fertility or on oestrus cycling, 
mating or fertility indices in females. However, an increase in post-implantation loss was observed at 
30 and 60 mg/kg per day. In embryofoetal development studies in rats and rabbits, increased 
resorptions and decreased foetal weight were observed at maternally toxic doses. Sporadic 
malformations in rabbits were observed at all doses. Following maternal oral administration during 
gestation and lactation in rats in the pre- and postnatal study, ruxolitinib had no effect on postnatal 
survival, developmental milestones, behavioural or reproductive function in offspring. Birth weight was 
slightly lower, and a transient decrease in postnatal body weight gain during the early lactation period 
were observed at 30 mg/kg per day. This information has been adequately reflected in SmPC section 
5.3. 
Considering the safety margins in rat and rabbit reproductive toxicity studies and the fact that other 
JAKi (e.g., Jakavi) are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation, the applicant was requested to 
discuss whether ruxolitinib cream should also be contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. The 
applicant initially did not consider that contraindication of Opzelura in pregnancy and lactation was 
warranted and has submitted an additional argumentation in support of their position, though no new 
data was presented. However, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with other JAK 
inhibitors have demonstrated risk to female fertility and teratogenicity. Foetal findings following 
maternal JAK inhibitor administration have included weight changes, external and visceral effects, and 
skeletal malformations such as fused ribs, vertebral anomalies, and misshapen and/or shortened limbs. 
Such effects coincide with the identified role of the JAK–STAT pathway in bone morphogenesis in

knockout animal studies (Damerau et al., 2020). Effects of JAK inhibition on female fertility have been 
characterised by decreased pregnancy rate and corpora lutea and increased pre- and post-implantation 
loss and resorptions (Hardwick et al., 2022). Furthermore, although embryotoxicity was observed at 
maternally toxic doses, it cannot be assumed that developmental toxicity was necessarily secondary to 
maternal toxicity, unless such a relationship would be demonstrated. 
It is acknowledged that the rabbit ruxolitinib exposure levels might not be representative of total 
pharmacologic activity due to extensive metabolism to active metabolites, and the safety margins for 
pharmacology-driven effects might be underestimated. However, an increased number of 
malformations were noted in rabbits treated with ruxolitinib but not in the control group. More 
importantly, some malformations with unknown causality were observed in dose groups, which were 
not associated with maternal toxicity. 
Since there is limited evidence from developmental rat and rabbit studies, but there is a proven 
developmental risk across the class of JAK inhibitors, the conclusions from the non-clinical data point 
to a relevant risk. Additionally, human PK data show that there is a non-negligible systemic exposure 
after ruxolitinib cream application, so negative effects from dermal use of ruxolitinib on developing 
foetus cannot be entirely excluded. Considering that the treatment of vitiligo can be postponed until 
the end of pregnancy, the applicant contraindicated the use of Ruxolitinib cream during pregnancy (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
Orally administered ruxolitinib to juvenile rats beginning on Day 7, 14 or 21 post-partum caused 
significant bone toxicity. These findings were more severe in males than in females, and when dosing 
was initiated at an earlier age. This information has been included in SmPC section 5.3. This may be 
partly due to the toxicokinetic (TK) profile in juvenile rats: systemic exposure to ruxolitinib decreased 
markedly with the increase of age, which was more evident in males. The published literature suggests 
several potential relationships between specific JAK-STAT signalling and bone metabolism, but how 
these individual actions relate to a coordinated effect of JAK inhibition on bone dynamics is currently 
not known. The relationship of the findings in rat to ruxolitinib pharmacology, and translation to 
humans is unclear, however the rat may not be an adequate representative model for this effect. The 
juvenile rat skeleton is predominantly a modelling skeleton, while the remodelling is more important in 
human bone formation, because the average bone tissue age in a 20-year growth period in humans 
exceeds the osteocyte-life span. Furthermore, no effects on the bone formation were reported in the 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies, where the ages of animals at the initiation (7 weeks of age for 
rats in the 6-month study, 4-5 months of age for dogs in the 12-month study, and 4 months of age for 
minipigs in the 9-month study) were generally equivalent to the human adolescent phase. Therefore, 
from a non-clinical perspective on bone formation, the use of ruxolitinib from the age of 12 could be 
supported. Nevertheless, potential effects on bone development in adolescents from age 12 need to be 
evaluated from a clinical viewpoint, see clinical safety section.  
Since animal data suggest that ruxolitinib is preferentially partitioned into milk and that data on 
juvenile toxicity indicate possible bone development effects in early postnatal development, the 
applicant contraindicated the use of ruxolitinib cream during breastfeeding (see SmPC section 4.3).  
The cream formulation used in the pivotal GLP studies was the same as the clinical formulation. The 
excipients contained in the drug product are well known, commonly used in the manufacture of 
medicinal products intended for cutaneous use and of the Ph. Eur. quality, except for glyceryl stearate 
SE. The chosen excipients are acceptable for the adult population. Their potential impact in the 
paediatric population has been sufficiently discussed (see section 2.4 on Quality). 
The cream formulation was mildly to slightly irritating to the skin and eye in rabbits in local toxicity 
studies. Ruxolitinib was not phototoxic, or a dermal sensitiser and had no photoallergy potential.

Drug process starting materials, intermediates, and impurities were evaluated in a series of in silico 
platforms, and if they were predicted mutagenic, they were further evaluated in vitro Ames test (TA98, 
TA100, TA1535, TA97a, and TA102). No impurity was recognised as mutagenic.  
ERA 
Ruxolitinib phosphate is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, ruxolitinib phosphate is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the applicant provided a comprehensive evaluation of pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic 
and toxicologic properties of ruxolitinib. Studies in animal have shown reproductive and skeletal 
toxicities. The impact on bone development is further discussed in the clinical safety section. Ruxolitnib 
is contraindicated in pregnancy and breast-feeding. Women of reproductive potential should be advised 
to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month following the final dose of ruxolitinib. 
Overall, ruxolitinib cream is therefore considered approvable from a non-clinical point.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
LC-MS/MS methods were used for the analysis of ruxolitinib concentrations in human plasma. Four 
methods were used, and they were validated at Incyte Corporation (Wilmington, DE), ABC Laboratories 
(Columbia, MO), and Frontage Laboratories (Exton, PA). Cross validation has been performed between 
the methods GLP-015 and GLP-018 and between the methods GLP-015 and BTM-2217. 
Dose-concentration analysis was performed using linear regression. Age and body surface area were 
significant predictors of Css. The analyses were performed adequately. Parameters were estimated 
with acceptable precision (RSE 5.8 – 36%). 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
Plasma PK information obtained by NCA was available from one phase 1 clinical study (INCB 18424-
103) and 1 Phase 2 study (INCB 18424-202).  
The pharmacokinetics of Opzelura were investigated in 429 subjects with vitiligo aged 12 years and 
older (12.6% were 12-17 years of age) with a mean ± STD BSA involvement of 7.31 ± 2.02% (range 
3.2% to 10.0%). Subjects applied approximately 1.58 mg/cm2 of Opzelura (dose range was 
approximately 0.18 grams to 8.4 grams of Opzelura per application) to the same skin areas twice daily 
for 24 weeks. 
The PK of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream was investigated in a maximal use study (study INCB 18424-103) 
from 40 adult and adolescent participants (aged ≥ 12 years) with atopic dermatitis (AD) with a mean 
± STD body surface area (BSA) involvement of 37.5 ± 16.1% (range: 25%-90%). In this study, 
participants applied approximately 1.5 mg/cm2 of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream (dose range was 
approximately 1.2 g to 37.6 g per application) BID to all affected areas identified at baseline for 28 
days. Blood samples were collected pre-application and at 1, 2, 4 and 12 post-doses on day 1 and day 
28. On day 15, samples were collected pre-application and 1-hour post-dose.  
Study INCB 18424-202 was a dose-escalation study. Ruxolitinib 1.0% or 1.5% cream was applied 
(approximately 1 to 2 mg/cm2) to participants with active, stable, plaque psoriasis involving 2% to 
20% BSA, for 28 days. Participants were randomized to the following 5 cohorts: Cohort A (1.5% BID, 
2%-7% BSA), Cohort B (1.5% BID, 8%-13% BSA), Cohort C (1.5% QD, 14%-20% BSA), Cohort D 
(1.0% BID, 14%-20% BSA), and Cohort E (1.5% BID, 14%-20% BSA). Blood samples were collected 
pre-application and approximately 1-hour post-application on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, pre-application on 
day 4 and pre-dose and at 1.5, 3, 6-, 9-, 24-, and 48-hours post-dose on day 28.   
The mean serial profiles of the plasma ruxolitinib concentrations on day 28 were almost flat (see Figure 
7) with the mean peak/trough ratio of approximately 1.6 to 3.2. The applicant was of the view that the 
observed long t½ for the topical formulation (as shown in Table 12) is due to the slow absorption rate 
of topical formulation and reflects the drug absorption rate rather than the drug elimination rate. 
Throughout the interval between applications of ruxolitinib cream, the mean concentrations were well-
below the whole blood ruxolitinib IC50 for JAK2 inhibition (281 nM), a level which the applicant 
considers clinically relevant for systemic pharmacological effects on bone marrow (Quintas-Cardama et 
al 2010). This concentration is based on whole blood, but in vitro blood partitioning studies indicated 
no preferential partitioning of ruxolitinib-related radioactivity into blood cells (EPAR Jakavi). In study

INCB 18424-103, mean relative bioavailability was 2.5% and ranged from 0.027% (subject with 29% 
BSA affected) to 19.0% (subject with 90% BSA affected). In study INCB 18424-202, the mean 
systemic bioavailability was 3.8%, 4.1%, 3.4%, 3.9%, and 5.2%, respectively, for Cohorts A-E. 
A summary of mean steady-state concentrations of ruxolitinib and bioavailability in study INCB 18424-
103 (Css is calculated as average of plasma concentrations on days 15 and 28) is shown in Table 11. 
The Cmax, tmax, Cmin, AUC, Cmax/Cmin ratio, and t½ at steady state after topical applications of ruxolitinib 
cream are summarized in Table 12.

Figure 7: Ruxolitinib plasma concentration (mean ± SE) over time on Day 1 and Day 28 (Linear Plot) 
(Study INCB 18424-103) 
Comparisons of steady-state plasma ruxolitinib concentrations between topical application of ruxolitinib 
cream and oral ruxolitinib dosing have been made. The applicant compared the ruxolitinib mean 
steady-state daily through concentration (Css) for 1.5% BID topical administration in participants with 
vitiligo (in Phase 3 studies arithmetic mean 56.9 nM, geometric mean 27.4 nM) with a Cavg,ss which is 
calculated as 218 nM from AUCss,0-12h = 2610 h*nM (geometric mean) in an oral study in healthy 
adult volunteers (DMB-08.84 in study INCB-132) following 15 mg BID PO administration. This was the 
lowest dose level from which steady-state serial PK data were available from healthy participants. On 
the other hand, the lowest dose level in oral ruxolitinib drug label is 5 mg BID, for which there are no 
observed data at steady state from healthy participants. Nonetheless, the Cavg,ss following 5 mg BID 
PO administration is expected to be approximately 73 nM based on dose proportionality. The arithmetic 
mean and median Css in a subgroup of 215 participants with vitiligo in Phase 3 studies in the top 50% 
(ie, above the median Css of 35.75 nM) are 99.2 and 83.5 nM for 1.5% BID, respectively. Therefore, 
there is an overlap between the plasma exposure in the top 50% of participants with vitiligo treated 
with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID in Phase 3 studies and the expected plasma exposure of the lowest 
approved oral dose of 5 mg ruxolitinib BID in healthy participants (study DMB-21.53). 
Following application of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream for 28 days in patients with atopic dermatitis to all 
affected areas (affected BSA 25 - 90%), mean relative bioavailability was 2.5%, ranging 0.027% to 
Assessment report

19% (subjects with 29% and 90% BSA treated respectively). Mean Cmax and Cmin at steady state in this 
study were 49 nM and 24 nM at 25-40% BSA and 353 nM and 159 nM at ≥40% BSA. In patients with 
psoriasis (affected BSA 2 – 20%), mean Cmax ranged 10 – 84 nM and mean Cmin ranged 5.4 – 35 nM. 
Based on the cohort means, Cmax, Cmin and AUCtau appear to increase with increasing treated BSA. 
Plasma concentrations in patients with AD were lower on day 28 than on day 1. Concentrations were 
higher in adult subjects compared to subjects < 18 years old and higher in subjects with ≥ 40% BSA 
treated compared to subjects with 25 – 40% BSA treated. Median Tmax ranged 1.5 – 12 h. Overall 
median Tmax was 3 – 4 h. Mean (arithmetic) half-life ranged 13 to 266 h; geometric mean half-life 
ranged 21 to 114 h. According to the applicant, the fairly long half-life likely mostly reflected the slow 
absorption with a flip-flop effect, since oral elimination half-life was approximately 3 h.  
Bioequivalence 
Formulations used in the clinical studies contain 0.15%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.5% w/w ruxolitinib 
base and equal amounts of excipients. The mean bioavailability of ruxolitinib cream was generally low, 
in the range of 1.5 to 15%. The data indicated no clear effect of frequency of application or formulation 
strength on bioavailability.   
In vitiligo patients in the Phase 3 studies treated with Ruxolitinib Cream 1.5% on maximally 10% BSA, 
mean Cmin was 56.9 nM (geometric mean 27.4 nM) and bioavailability was estimated to be 9.72% 
(geometric mean 8.42%). 
Average trough values and bioavailability after use of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% on maximally 10% of 
BSA in vitiligo patients (studies INCB 18424-306 and INCB 18424-307) are shown in Table 13.

Distribution 
Based on an in vitro study, ruxolitinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins, mostly to albumin. The 
apparent volume of distribution after oral administration in myelofibrosis patients at steady state was 
53-65 litres. For the cream, volume of distribution is not reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023

Elimination 
Following topical administration of ruxolitinib, the parent compound was predominant in plasma. Also  
5 major metabolites were found in plasma, M18, M27, M11, M8 and M7, at amounts comprising up to 
24% of parent compound in plasma. These metabolites had also been found after oral administration 
of ruxolitinib. Considering the limited bioavailability following topical administration when the cream is 
applied to maximally 10% BSA as recommended in the SmPC, and the limited contribution of the 
metabolites to the PD activity (15 – 18%), no significant pharmacological activity is expected from the 
metabolites. Genetic polymorphism can be considered not relevant for ruxolitinib metabolism. 
Ruxolitinib is not metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. CYP2C9 plays a role in ruxolitinib metabolism, 
but only to a minor extent, but may become important in case CYP3A4 is blocked. 
Following a single oral dose of 14C-ruxolitinib in healthy adult participants, elimination was 
predominately through metabolism with 74% of radioactivity excreted in urine and 22% excreted via 
faeces. Unchanged drug accounted for less than 1% of the excreted total radioactivity. Oral clearance 
has been estimated to be approximately 19 L/h. Excretion was not investigated following topical 
administration. According to the applicant, the excretion pathways are however not expected to be 
different from those after oral administration. 
Mean (arithmetic) half-life ranged 13 to 266 h; geometric mean half-life ranged 21 to 114 h. The fairly 
long half-life likely mostly reflects the slow absorption, since oral elimination half-life was 
approximately 3 h.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Linear regression indicated a dose-proportional increase of Css with ruxolitinib dose. This was 
confirmed by the results from the Phase 2 study in vitiligo patients, where Ctrough increased with 
increasing strength and frequency of dosing and approximately similar treated BSA. Also, Ctrough 
increased with treated BSA, when the dose was the same. 
In the Phase 3 studies in vitiligo patients, trough values were similar from week 4 to week 40 and in 
Phase 3 studies in patients with atopic dermatitis, trough values were similar from week 2 to week 8, 
indicating that steady state occurred at week 2 or earlier. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability in average trough concentrations of ruxolitinib is high, with CV% of 100 – 
200%. The intra-individual variability, expressed as the coefficient of variation, was estimated as 
157%. This was similar to the inter-individual variability, which is as expected considering the variation 
in the exact amount of cream used and the exact area of treated skin. 
Special populations 
No studies have been performed with ruxolitinib cream in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No 
dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, based upon estimated 
pharmacological activity adjusted AUC of ruxolitinib and metabolites (up to a 31% increase). In 
patients with end stage renal disease, this exposure increased almost 2-fold. As a precautionary 
measure it is advised that ruxolitinib 1.5% cream should not be used by patients with end stage renal 
disease, due to lack of data regarding the safety (see SmPC section 4.2). 
In patients with hepatic impairment, formation of metabolites as percentage of parent compound was 
not higher than in case of normal liver function. There was no relationship between the increase in AUC 
and the severity of the hepatic impairment and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary in case of 
hepatic impairment.

Gender, race and skin type (pale and fair skin vs darker types of skin) were no significant predictors of 
PK variability. 
Age was a significant predictor of PK variability. Css was predicted to be 36% lower in subjects aged 
18 years and 28% higher in subjects aged 62 years, compared to subjects aged 40 years. Considering 
the limited absolute exposure, the small difference in absolute Css between the groups 18 – 65 years 
and ≥ 65 years (arithmetic mean 59.9 nM, and 66.6 nM resp.), and the high inter-individual variability 
(> 100%), are considered not clinically relevant. 
The exposure is somewhat lower in adolescents than in adults. The applicant ascribed this to the 
relatively lower daily ruxolitinib dose used in adolescents.  
BSA was a significant predictor of PK variability. However, the effect of BSA can be considered not 
clinically relevant, considering the limited absolute exposure and the high inter-individual variability  
(> 100%). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vivo interaction studies with oral ruxolitinib, maximally a doubling of AUC can be expected 
when a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered. In section 4.5 of the SmPC it is mentioned that the 
plasma AUC is approximately doubled with co administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 while only 
a modest increase was seen with co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
No interaction studies have been performed with topically administered ruxolitinib. The potential for 
interactions with ruxolitinib is considered to be low because of the limited systemic exposure following 
topical administration. Ruxolitinib has not been evaluated in combination with other cutaneous 
medicinal products; therefore, co-application on the same skin areas is not recommended.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Ruxolitinib is not a substrate for P-gp. Ruxolitinib and its metabolite M18 did not inhibit P-gp at 
clinically relevant concentrations. Ruxolitinib and M18 also did not inhibit the transporters BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Ruxolitinib inhibited CYP3A4 in vitro with an IC50 of 8.8 µM. Ruxolitinib did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 to a significant extent. Ruxolitinib was not an inducer of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ruxolitinib is a Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor with selectivity for the JAK1 and JAK2 isoforms. 
Intracellular JAK signalling involves recruitment of STATs (signal transducers and activators of 
transcription) to cytokine receptors, and subsequent modulation of gene expression. Autoimmune IFNγ 
producing cytotoxic T lymphocytes are thought to be directly responsible for melanocyte destruction in 
human vitiligo. Recruitment of cytotoxic lymphocytes to lesional skin is mediated via IFNγ dependent 
chemokines, such as CXCL10. Downstream signalling of IFNγ is JAK1/2 dependent and treatment with 
ruxolitinib reduces CXCL10 levels in vitiligo patients (see below figure).

Figure 8: Ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Data from three clinical studies (NCBI 18424-211, -306, and -307) in participants with vitiligo were 
used for the exploration of pharmacodynamics (PD). According to the applicant, the pathophysiology of 
vitiligo as an auto-immune disorder supports the relevance of JAK inhibition in the treatment of this 
disorder through repigmentation.  
Primary pharmacodynamics of ruxolitinib is well known from its developmental programme based on 
its oral formulation (Jakavi, ruxolitinib tablets). DDI and genetic differences in the response on 
treatment with topical ruxolitinib were thus not performed by the applicant given the low systemic 
exposure.  
Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics revealed no PK/PD association between Css and 
haemoglobin, but there seemed to be an inverse PK-PD relationship for neutrophils as the lowest 
counts were observed at the highest quartile of Css levels. In addition, there were a few subjects (two 
in phase 2 and two in phase 3 studies) with grades 2 or 3 decrease in neutrophils, who appear to have 
higher Css (higher than 100 nM). No change was observed in mean platelet volume. A slight increase 
in platelet count was observed in subjects in the highest Css quartile (higher than 85 nM). This effect is 
opposite to the effect on platelets with oral ruxolitinib, where decreases in platelets were observed.  
Relationship between plasm concentration and effect 
PK/PD relationship – biomarkers 
CXCL9, CXCL 10, and INFy are acknowledged biomarkers for inflammatory disease. INFy in blood of 
participants with vitiligo was absent / low in over 70% of the participant and no treatment effect was 
found for this biomarker. This might be caused by the large part of participants with stable disease 
(45%). For CXCL10 a decrease was observed with increased duration of treatment. 
PK/PD relationship – clinical outcomes 
Ruxolitinib phosphate is a selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. In response to stimulation by cytokines such 
as Interleukin 6 (IL-6), JAKs are responsible for phosphorylation of the STAT3 transcription factor. IL-6 
induced phosphorylation of STAT3 can thus be used as a pharmacodynamic marker for JAK inhibition. 
Inhibition was defined as IC50 (inhibitory concentration at 50% inhibition) of ruxolitinib. The IC50 was 
determined in a number of clinical studies.

Clinical studies were performed at different sites according to the study protocol of studies INCB 
18424-131, -132, -135, -137, and –142, in healthy participants. Blood samples were drawn from 
healthy subjects at various times after receiving ruxolitinib and the levels of pSTAT3 in response to ex 
vivo IL-6 stimulation were measured using a pSTAT3-specific ELISA. 
PK-PD data were available from 72 healthy volunteers from studies INCB 18424-131 (single dose) and 
-132 (multiple dose). 
The study population in the concentration-response analyses regarding efficacy consisted of 557 
participants with evaluable efficacy responses and evaluable Css.

double-blind, vehicle-controlled period in pooled phase 3 Css — PK/PD population of F-VASI75 
Race (others vs white) was identified as a significant predictor of the F-VASI75 (≥ 75% Improvement 
From Baseline in the Face Vitiligo Area Scoring Index) responses.  
The final logit-Emax model of F-VASI75 included an intercept, an Emax term of the effect of Css, and a 
binary covariate predictor: race (others vs white). The model parameter estimates and the estimated 
odds ratios for ruxolitinib concentrations in plasma as well as covariate predictors are presented in 
Table 14. The maximum odds ratio for achieving Emax was estimated as 6.08. 
Plasma concentrations and F-VASI75 
The final logit-Emax model of F-VASI75 included an intercept, an Emax term of the effect of Css, and a 
binary covariate predictor (race; Others vs White). The odds ratio for race was 2.28 (90% CI: 1.51, 
3.45), implicating that the odds for participants of non-White to achieve F-VASI75 responses at Week 
24 was 128% higher than for White participants. The estimated Emax by Css on the logit of the 
probability of achieving F-VASI75 at Week 24 was estimated at 1.80 (90% CI: 1.30, 2.31), 
corresponding to a maximum odds ratio of 6.08 (90% CI: 3.68, 10.0) that could be attributed to Css.

The odds ratio for Css at 7.70 nM, the estimated EC50, vs 0 nM (ie, vehicle-treated or ruxolitinib 
cream-treated but nonmeasurable concentration in plasma) would be 2.47 (90% CI: 1.92, 3.17). 
Table 14: F-VASI75 logit-Emax model parameter estimates and odds ratios 
Similar results were obtained in the analysis of F-VASI50. Race (others vs white) and ethnicity (others

Dose-response relationships 
Relations between plasma ruxolitinib Css and clinical efficacy (in terms of F-VASI75, F-VASI5-, and 
VNS score or 5 after 24 weeks of treatment) were characterised using a generalised non-linear logit-
Emax model framework. Estimated plasma eC50 were all low (6-10 nM). Imputed EC90 values were 
69.2 nM (F-VASI75), 55.3 nM (F-VASI50), and 83.4 nM (VNS score 4 or 5); all in the range of the 64th 
– 75th percentile of plasma ruxolitinib Css in the two pivotal studies. The probabilities of efficacy 
responses enter the plateau as the plasma ruxolitinib Css exceeds EC90, which are less than 30% of 
the whole blood ruxolitinib IC50 for JAK2 inhibition (i.e., 281 nM). Percentage of change in F-BSA at 
week 24 was not statistically associated with plasma ruxolitinib Css. 
A significant relationship was observed between plasma ruxolitinib Css and the possibility of achieving 
75% improvement in the F-VASI, 50% improvement in the T-VASI or improvement indicated by 
participants as 4 or 5 (VNS 4-5). These associations suggest that topical ruxolitinib not only has a local

effect but also result in a non-negligible, relevant systemic exposure (see section 2.6.3 below where 
this is further discussed).  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This application concerns a cream containing ruxolitinib phosphate (INCB018424) (15 mg/g), proposed 
for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 
years of age. Ruxolitinib is an inhibitor of JAKs (Janus kinases) with selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2. 
Ruxolitinib is already registered for oral use (Jakavi, EMEA/H/C/002464).  
The cream is recommended to be applied to affected skin areas to a maximum of 10% of body surface 
area twice daily. 
The developmental programme of ruxolitinib phosphate cream consisted of one Phase 2 and two Phase 
3 studies in patients with vitiligo, two Phase 1, one Phase 2 and two Phase 3 studies in patients with 
atopic dermatitis, and four Phase 2 studies in patients with plaque psoriasis and alopecia areata, 
comprising both adult participants and adolescents. Oral studies which were part of the MAA dossier for 
Jakavi have also been provided. In addition, the relationship between dose and plasma concentrations 
was analysed to characterise this relationship and to identify the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors on this relationship.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods  
The medium QC samples were not at 30 – 50% of the calibration range, as recommended in the 
Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2), but at 
5% and 80%, corresponding to 50 nM and 40 nM respectively (methods GLP-015 and GLP-018) and 
7% (method BTM-2217), corresponding to 49 nM. However, since most average steady state 
concentrations were lower than or around 50 nM, with peaks higher than 100 nM being mostly 
incidental, this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Calibration and QC samples in the clinical studies complied with the criteria of the Guideline on 
Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2). Incurred sample 
reanalysis (ISR) was performed in studies INCB 18424-102, INCB 18424-103, INCB 18424-211, INCB 
18424-303 and INCB 18424-304 and was considered adequate. ISR results for studies INCB 18424-
306 and INCB 18424-307 have been submitted upon CHMP’s request and were considered adequate. 
The longest sample storage times were within the established long-term stability for ruxolitinib (672 
days at -70 °C), except in study INCB 18424-102 where the longest sample storage time was 878 
days. Additional long-term stability data have been provided upon CHMP’s request. Long-term stability 
of ruxolitinib has been established for 991 days at -70 °C. The maximal storage time was within the 
established stability in all studies. 
PK data analysis  
The methods for pharmacokinetic data analysis are acceptable. The analyses were performed 
adequately and the parameters were estimated with acceptable precision (RSE 5.8 – 36%). 
Absorption 
In vitiligo patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% on maximally 10% BSA in the Phase 3 studies 
INCB 18424-306 and INCB 18424-307, mean Css was 56.9 nM (geometric mean 27.4 nM) and 
bioavailability was estimated to be 9.72% (geometric mean 8.42%). The overall mean trough 
concentration in vitiligo patients when ruxolitinib cream 1.5% was used on maximally 10% BSA is 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 59/152 
 
 
 
comparable to the trough concentration when using the 15 mg bid oral dose of ruxolitinib (geometric 
mean 31.5 nM, arithmetic mean 37.2 nM) and the geometric AUC0-12h in psoriasis patients treated on 
8-13% BSA (306 nM.h) is about 12% AUC0-12h at a 15 mg bid oral dose (2610 nM.h). Compared to a 5 
mg oral dose, the relative estimated steady state Cmax, AUC and Cmin after application of the 1.5% 
cream b.i.d. to about 10% surface is about 15, 35 and 184%, respectively. Based on the above data, 
lower exposure levels are thus observed after application of the cream and higher concentrations will 
only occur at the end of the dosing interval in the low concentration range (over about 3 h considering 
the estimated Cmin value of 19.3 nM after application of the cream, 10.5 nM after oral administration 
and the elimination half-lives). Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant also discussed the potential impact 
on clinical safety. The CHMP agreed that the update of the safety data did not point to ADRs of a 
systemic nature, and that application to a BSA up to 20% did not lead to apparent safety issues. There 
also was no recognizable relation between exposure and safety, notably occurrence of infections or 
instances of neutropenia. There however were concerns raised regarding the occurrence of NMSC that 
may have a local component, and bone safety upon long term exposure in adolescents. This is further 
discussed in section 2.6.9. 
Formulations used in the clinical studies contained 0.15%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, and 1.5% w/w 
ruxolitinib base and equal amounts of excipients. Mean relative bioavailability in the studies ranged 1.5 
– 15%. The data indicate no clear effect of frequency of application or formulation strength on 
bioavailability. The calculation of the bioavailability may however not have been very accurate, 
because it was based on the average dose per subject. The dose per treatment was not actually 
measured. Ctrough appears to be higher at higher strength and at BID compared to QD application. 
Distribution 
Based on an in vitro study (study DMB-07.11), ruxolitinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins, 
mostly to albumin. The apparent volume of distribution after oral administration in myelofibrosis 
patients at steady state was 53-65 litres. For the cream, volume of distribution was not reported.  
Elimination 
Excretion was not investigated following topical administration in vitiligo patients. The excretion 
pathways are however not expected to be different from those after oral administration. 
The mean elimination half-life of orally administered ruxolitinib is approximately 3 hours. The mean 
apparent terminal half-life of ruxolitinib following topical application of Opzelura was estimated in 9 
adult and adolescent patients with ≥ 25% BSA involvement with atopic dermatitis and is approximately 
116 hours, reflecting, according to the applicant, the slow drug absorption rate rather than the drug 
elimination rate. 
Following topical administration of ruxolitinib, the parent compound was predominant in plasma. Also 5 
major metabolites were found in plasma, M18, M27, M11, M8 and M7, at amounts comprising up to 
24% of parent compound in plasma. Considering the limited bioavailability following topical 
administration when the cream is applied to maximally 10% BSA as recommended in the SmPC, and 
the limited contribution of the metabolites to the PD activity (15 – 18%), no significant 
pharmacological activity is expected from the metabolites. 
Genetic polymorphism can be considered not relevant for ruxolitinib metabolism. Ruxolitinib is not 
metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. CYP2C9 plays a minor role in ruxolitinib metabolism, which may 
become important in case CYP3A4 is blocked. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency  
Linear regression indicated a dose-proportional increase of Css with ruxolitinib dose. This was 
confirmed by the results from study INCB 18424-211, where Css increased with increasing strength 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 60/152 
 
 
 
and frequency of dosing and approximately similar treated BSA. Also, Css increased with treated BSA, 
when dose was the same. 
In studies INCB 18424-306 and INCB 18424-307, trough values were similar from week 4 to week 40 
and in studies INCB 18424-303 and INCB 18424-304, trough values were similar from week 2 to week 
8, indicating that steady state occurs in week 2 or earlier. 
Upon CHMP’s request, information regarding intra-individual variability was provided by the applicant. 
The intra-individual variability, expressed as the coefficient of variation, was estimated as 157%. This 
was similar to the inter-individual variability, which is as expected considering the variation in the exact 
amount of cream used and the exact area of treated skin treated.  
Special populations 
For oral ruxolitinib, it is recommended either to reduce the starting dose in patients with severe renal 
impairment by 50%, or to reduce the starting dose to 5 mg BID. This is due to an increase of exposure 
to, primarily, mono-oxygenated metabolites. There are no human safety data on the higher metabolite 
exposures. These metabolites are also formed when ruxolitinib cream is used. When ruxolitinib 1.5% 
cream is used on maximally 10% BSA, the exposure based on the pharmacological activity adjusted 
AUC of ruxolitinib plus the metabolites increases up to maximally 1.3-fold in case of severe renal 
impairment and up to 2-fold in case of end stage renal disease (ESRD). Since the exposure may be 
twice as high or higher in patients with ESRD, in particular if more than 10% BSA would be treated, as 
a precautionary measure it was advised that ruxolitinib 1.5% cream should not be used by patients 
with end stage renal disease, due to lack of data regarding the safety. This has been added to section 
4.2 of the SmPC.  
In case of hepatic impairment, AUC0-inf of orally administered ruxolitinib was increased by up to 
maximally 87%, though there was no relationship between the increase in AUC and the severity of the 
hepatic impairment (increase in AUC was 87%, 28% and 65% in patients with mild, moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment respectively). Considering the fact that there was no clear relationship 
between severity of hepatic impairment and the increase in AUC, a dosing advice for patients with 
hepatic impairment was considered not necessary. This information has been adequately reflected in 
SmPC section 4.2. 
The PK of ruxolitinib was not significantly affected by gender, race and skin type. No clinically relevant 
effect on the PK of ruxolitinib is expected regarding age ≥ 65 years compared to 18-65 years and body 
surface area (see SmPC section 4.2). Further, no relevant impact of skin thickness on ruxolitinib 
exposure is expected as the efficacy of ruxolitinib cream on vitiligo is not dependent on ruxolitinib 
systemic exposure. 
The exposure was somewhat lower in adolescents than in adults. This is likely caused by the smaller 
treated lesion area and the smaller amount of cream applied per unit area in adolescents compared to 
adults.  
Based on in vivo interaction studies with oral ruxolitinib, maximally a doubling of AUC can be expected 
when a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered. In section 4.5 of the SmPC it is mentioned that the 
plasma AUC is approximately doubled with co administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 while only 
a modest increase was seen with co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. This is agreed. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pathophysiology of vitiligo as an auto-immune disorder supports the relevance of JAK inhibition in 
the treatment of this disorder through re-pigmentation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 61/152 
 
 
 
The primary pharmacodynamics of ruxolitinib, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, is well known from studies 
with oral application. Systemic exposure is lower with topical application when compared to oral 
administration. As JAK inhibitors are known for haematological effects, secondary pharmacology was 
evaluated for topical ruxolitinib and haematological parameters. There was no relevant effect on 
haemoglobin levels, and also no clear trend on neutrophils. The use of high dose oral ruxolitinib 
(Jakavi) was characterised with myelosuppression and lower platelets counts, while in contrast, 
another JAK1/2 inhibitor was associated with modest increments in platelet counts and VTE when given 
at relatively low oral doses in diverse auto-immune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and atopic 
dermatitis).  
No pharmacodynamic DDI or genetic differences in the response on topical ruxolitinib were 
investigated, and this is accepted as the cream is recommended to be applied without any further 
topical treatments.  
INFy values in blood was absent / low in over 70% of the participants which might be caused by the 
large part of participants with stable disease (45%). INFy is assumed to play a pivotal role in the 
pathophysiology of vitiligo and treatment outcome with ruxolitinib, but vitiligo being a peripheral, local 
(skin) disease, serum INFy may not necessarily be detected nor related to treatment response. The 
finding that CXCL10, another biomarker for vitiligo which is associated with INFy, correlated with the 
VASI and treatment response, was therefore considered satisfactory. 
A significant relationship was observed between plasma concentrations and the possibility of achieving 
75% improvement in the F-VASI, 50% improvement in the T-VASI, or improvement indicated by 
participants as 4 or 5 (VNS 4-5). These associations suggested that topical ruxolitinib not only has a 
local effect but also results in a non-negligible, relevant systemic exposure.  The applicant was 
therefore requested to discuss whether there indeed was systemic exposure and whether this systemic 
exposure was relevant in terms of efficacy and safety.  
Based on the data of study 211, the applicant argued that the treatment effect is primarily related to 
the amount of BSA that is treated. Study participants who had > 20% BSA affected did not show 
evidence of repigmentation in areas that were not treated with ruxolitinib cream, which would have 
been expected in case of systemic action of ruxolitinib. Also, serum CXCL10 levels were reduced after 
treatment, but were not correlated with systemic exposure (Css). It is agreed that these correlations 
are low/absent and likely determined by outliers (although performing correlation after stratification of 
one of the bivariates is not endorsed).  
Further evidence comes from the non-clinical studies in mini pigs, showing that topical ruxolitinib 
primarily reached the dermis and epidermis (site of action), much more than reaching the blood 
stream. Given the above, it is a likely possibility that the correlations that were detected between 
efficacy responses (F-VASI75, T-VASI50, and VNS scores of 4 or 5) and steady-state plasma ruxolitinib 
trough concentrations in the Phase 2 and 3 vitiligo studies, were based on the amount of BSA treated, 
but not a result of systemic exposure to ruxolitinib. 
The applicant chose infections and neutropenia as variables to evaluate the relation between systemic 
exposure to ruxolitinib and safety. It is agreed that these two parameters are a priori relevant 
representations of the concept of safety, because of the proposed mechanism of action of ruxolitinib 
(JAK inhibition). The applicant has analysed plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib, stratified by presence 
or absence of infections. According to the results including the 52-week follow-up data (pool 4), the 
Css (medians) was similar in patients with (32 nM) and without (31 nM) infection, which was 
corroborated by similarity of P25 – P75 and the geometrical means. It is therefore considered that 
there is no obvious relation between the occurrence of infections and level of systemic exposure. The 
applicant also assessed whether there was a relation between systemic exposure and a certain pattern 
of infections, which was not found, as might be expected. The incidence of neutropenia was low (the 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 62/152 
 
 
 
most frequently occurring cytopenia, see section 2.6.9), which is reassuring, but also precludes a 
meaningful analysis of the relation of neutropenia with systemic exposure. 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the systemic exposure that followed topical application of ruxolitinib 
does not correlate with efficacy and is not related to the occurrence of infections. 
Race was a covariate on the relationship between Css and and the chance of achieving 75% 
improvement in the F-VASI75 and 50% improvement in the F-VASI50, predicting lower responses for 
non-white patients. This is however not due to a difference in PK, as there was no difference in Css 
between subjects with light skin (types I and II) and subjects with darker types of skin. In contrast, 
according to the subgroup analyses of clinical responder rates in the pivotal trials, ruxolitinib cream 
appeared to be similarly effective in all subgroups for race, although confidence intervals were wide for 
non-caucasian subgroups (see Ancillary analyses, section 2.6.5.2). Due to low patient numbers of 
subjects with race other than white no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Remarkably, there was no 
significant relationship between Css and the continuous parameter F-BSA (percent change from 
baseline in total affected facial area at week 24). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of topically applied ruxolitinib have been adequately characterised. Due 
to lack of data regarding the safety and as a precautionary measure, SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2 were 
updated to advise HCPs that ruxolitinib 1.5% cream should not be used by patients with end stage 
renal disease.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant has performed one phase 2 study for dose-finding (INCB 18424-211) and two phase 3 
studies (INCB 18424-306 and -307) in patients with vitiligo, and both studies were completed. A 
maintenance – withdrawal study comprising participants who completed study 306 or 307, had 
recently been initiated (INCB 18424-308) (Table 17); final data are expected in the first half of 2023 
(also see section 2.7).  
The study population of the pivotal studies 306 and 307 included adolescents (12 – 17 years of age) 
and adults, with non-segmental vitiligo involving up to 10% of the total body surface area (BSA) and 
with at least some facial involvement (see inclusion criteria). A single dose regimen of ruxolitinib cream 
(1.5% BID) was included in the pivotal studies; it was the highest dose regimen in the dose-finding 
study. It was planned that ~10% of patients would be adolescents. PK data were also available from 
adolescents with atopic dermatitis in studies INCB 18424-102 and INCB 18424-103 (see section on 
pharmacokinetics). No further studies in special populations had been performed.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study INCB 18424-211 was a phase 2, randomized study designed as a proof-of-concept and dose-
ranging study, including PK assessments, with an open-label extension to 104 weeks to evaluate long-
term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib cream in subjects with segmental or non-segmental vitiligo. A 
total of 157 adult patients with segmental or non-segmental vitiligo were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to 
one of the five 24-week dosing regimens (ruxolitinib 0.15% QD, 0.5% QD, 1.5% QD, 1.5% BID, and 
vehicle). Participants on the three highest dosing regimens continued up to week 52, thereafter all 
participants could continue with the highest dosing regimen (1.5% BID). Application of the cream was 
limited to 20% of the total BSA. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who reached 
F-VASI50 at week 24; the F-VASI75 was secondary endpoint (Figure 11). 
Figure 11: Design of dose-ranging study (INCB 18424-211) 
Results showed superiority of ruxolitinib versus vehicle for each of the 4 dosing regimens, with the 
highest percentages responders in the 1.5% QD and BID groups (Table 18). Based on these 24-week 
results, the 1.5% QD dosing regimen was initially selected by the applicant for the confirmatory 
studies and this was endorsed in the 2019 CHMP Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/1155/3/2019/III), 
considering the lower systemic exposure with the QD regimen compared to the 1.5% BID regimen. 
However, based on the 52-week results at the F-VASI75 with 58% responders in the 1.5% BID group 
versus 43% responders in the 1.5% QD group (Figure 12), the applicant ultimately selected the 1.5% 
BID regimen as the single dose of ruxolitinib cream to be tested in the confirmatory studies. Given the 
largest proportions of responders in F-VASI75 for the 1.5% BID dose at week 24 and beyond and given 
that the F-VASI75 is more stringent than the F-VASI50, this choice can be understood. Further, in the 
2019 CHMP Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/1155/3/2019/III), the applicant was recommended to favor 
the F-VASI75 over the F-VASI50 as primary endpoint for the confirmatory trials.

The bar chart with proportions of F-VASI50 responders over time until week 52, showed numerical 
superiority of all ruxolitinib dosing groups versus vehicle from week 8 (Figure 12). After week 24, in 
the continued double-blind period, the treatment effect appeared to increase further for the 0.5% QD 
group and seemed to plateau for the 1.5% QD and BID dosing regimens.

Proportions of participants reaching the F-VASI75 over time are shown below (Figure 13). Participants 
in the vehicle group did not achieve this endpoint. The largest proportions were observed for ruxolitinib 
1.5% BID with 30% at week 24 and 52% at week 52; for ruxolitinib 1.5% QD these proportions were 
17% and 30%.

The main studies that provided efficacy data were:  
Title of study 
Study INCB 18424-306: A Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, vehicle-controlled, efficacy and safety 
study of ruxolitinib cream followed by an extension period in participants with vitiligo (TRuE-V1).  
Study INCB 18424-307: A Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, vehicle-controlled, efficacy and safety 
study of ruxolitinib cream followed by an extension period in participants with vitiligo (TRuE-V1/2).  
These pivotal studies were identical in design and therefore are presented together (Figure 14).  
The  two  trials  had  a  screening  period  of  up  to  32  days,  followed  by  a  randomised,  vehicle-controlled 
period  of  24  weeks,  and  a  subsequent  treatment  extension  phase  of  28  weeks  during  which  all 
participants received ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. Follow-up was determined at 30 days.

•  Treatments 
Study treatment 
In the double-blind period, participants were treated with either ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID or 
vehicle cream BID. Study medication was provided by the sponsor in tubes of 60 grams. Participants 
were instructed to apply the cream as a thin film at depigmented areas which were identified at 
baseline up to 10% BSA, and to use no more than one tube of 60 grams a week. Treatment of up to 
10% BSA was chosen as it was considered most appropriate for long-term, continuous treatment of 
vitiligo; applying a topical treatment BID to an area greater than 10% BSA was assumed to be difficult 
and impractical for most patients. Treatment had to be continued even if (partial or full) re-
pigmentation was achieved. In case of expansion of existing areas of vitiligo treatment was allowed to 
be extended (up to a maximum of 10% BSA) to these areas as well, after evaluation at the clinic. 
Applications were documented in diaries by the participant and study tubes were weighted before and 
after application. Compliance was then determined by the number of actual versus anticipated number 
of applications, which had to be within 70% to 130% of the prescribed number of applications. 
Discontinuation 
According to the guidelines for interruption and restarting of study drug in the protocol, treatment with 
the study drug was interrupted in case of ALAT / ASAT > 3 times the upper limits, any Grade 3 or higher 
abnormality in lab, any Grade 4 or higher abnormality or ASAT / ALAT > 5 times upper limits of normal.  
Permanent  discontinuation  of  the  study  drug  was  required  in  case  of  unacceptable  severity  of  an  AE 
possibly related to study drug, including worsening of vitiligo that required treatment with a prohibited 
concomitant drug. Pregnancy as well as non-compliance (under certain circumstances) were reasons to 
discontinue a participant from the study.  
Assessment report

Concomitant treatment 
Participants were allowed to use bland emollients or camouflage makeups and sunscreens at least  
2 hours after study drug application. Over the counter products were allowed until 7 days before 
baseline visit unless deemed acceptable by the investigator. Prescription medication was allowed until 
7 days prior to baseline visit. Treatment for dermatological diseases other than vitiligo was allowed on 
areas not concurrently treated for vitiligo if it involved < 10% of the BSA outside the areas treated for 
vitiligo (including topical steroids for a maximum of seven days and calcineurin inhibitors). Oral 
steroids for other conditions such as exacerbations of asthma were acceptable for no longer than seven 
days.  
Rescue treatment 
No rescue medication was foreseen in the protocol. Participants were not allowed to use any other 
treatments for vitiligo at any time during the study. If the worsening of vitiligo required treatment with 
prohibited medication, the study treatment had to be discontinued.  
•  Objectives 
Primary objective of studies INCB 18424-306 and -307 was to evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib cream 
1.5% BID in participants with vitiligo versus vehicle cream BID after 24 weeks of treatment, defined as 
the percentage of participants achieving the F-VASI75. Secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability after 24 and 52 weeks of treatment of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID versus 
vehicle cream BID as well as the study of biomarkers in blood.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary outcome 
The primary outcome was the proportion of participants reaching at least 75% improvement in facial 
depigmentation from baseline on the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI75) at week 24.  
The VASI is a validated physician-based tool for the quantification of depigmentation in vitiligo, 
analogous to the PASI which is used in psoriasis. It is based on a composite estimate of the overall 
body surface area (BSA) of vitiligo patches and the degree of re-pigmentation within these patches 
over time. The degree of depigmentation for each vitiligo site (hands, upper extremities, trunk, lower 
extremities, and feet) is determined and estimated to the nearest percentage (i.e. 0%, 10%, 25%, 
50%, 75%, 90%, 100%) (Figure 15). The VASI is then calculated with the following formula:  
VASI = Σ [hand units] x [residual depigmentation] all body sites  
Figure 15: Components of the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) and reference pictures 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 70/152 
 
 
 
 
The F-VASI was developed by the applicant for the purpose of the pivotal studies. The percentage of 
vitiligo involvement in the face (% BSA) was calculated for 3 sites of the face (area on the forehead to 
the original hairline, on the cheek to the jawline vertically to the jawline, and laterally from the corner 
of the mouth to the tragus). Of note, the face did not include the lips, scalp, ears or neck, but included 
the nose and eyelids. For each of the three sites, the degree of depigmentation was determined (in 
%). The F-VASI was calculated by multiplying the values assessed for the vitiligo involvement by 
percentage of affected skin and summing the values of these sites (range 0 – 3). No additional studies 
on the psychometric properties of the F-VASI (and the T-VASI, see below) were performed.  
Key secondary outcomes 
Key secondary endpoints were tested sequentially only if the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint 
was rejected.  
•  F-VASI50 at week 24: The proportion of participants reaching at least 50% improvement in 
facial depigmentation from baseline on the facial VASI. 
•  F-VASI90 at week 24: The proportion of participants reaching at least 90% improvement in 
facial depigmentation from baseline on the facial VASI.  
•  T-VASI50 at week 24: The proportion of participants reaching at least 50% improvement in 
facial depigmentation from baseline on the total-body VASI. The T-VASI was defined by the 
applicant and consisted of the traditional VASI with 1 additional body area, which is the 
face/neck. For the T-VASI, the percentage of vitiligo involvement was estimated in hand units 
(% BSA) as described above, by the same investigator during the study, for six body regions 
(the head / neck, hands, upper extremities excluding the hands, the trunk, lower extremities 
excluding the feet, and feet). Of note, the original VASI comprises the same body regions, 
except for the head / neck. The degree of depigmentation for each vitiligo site is determined 
and estimated to the nearest percentage (i.e. 0%, 10%0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%). The 
T-VASI is calculated by multiplying the values assessed for the vitiligo involvement by the 
percentage of affected skin for each body site and summing the values of each body site 
together (range 0 – 100): VASI = Σ [hand units] x [residual depigmentation] all body sites. 
•  Vitiligo Noticeable Scale (VNS) response at week 24: The proportion of patients with a 
score of 4 (a lot less noticeable depigmentation) or 5 (depigmentation no longer noticeable) in 
the Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS). The VNS is a patient‐reported measure of vitiligo 
treatment success, which has a 5-point scale. Psychometric properties were condidered 
sufficient (Batchelor et al 2016). The facial photograph taken at baseline was shown to the 
participants for reference and a mirror was provided to the participants to assess the vitiligo on 
their face. The participant was asked to respond to the following query: ‘Compared with before 
treatment, how noticeable is the vitiligo now?’. The responses options were: (1) More 
noticeable, (2) As noticeable, (3) Slightly less noticeable, (4) A lot less noticeable, and (5) No 
longer noticeable. VNS scores of 4 or 5 were interpreted as representing treatment success. 
• 
Percent change from baseline in F
BSA. 
Other secondary endpoints 
‑
All other secondary outcomes, not being regarded as ‘key secondary’, were summarised using 
descriptive statistics, no statistical hypothesis testing was planned to be performed. These outcomes 
included:  
• 
Percentages change from baseline: F-VASI, T-VASI, Facial and Total body Physician Global 
Vitiligo Assessment (F- and T-PhGVA), and T-BSA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 71/152 
 
 
 
• 
Patient-reported outcomes: Color-matching question, Facial and Total body Patient Global 
Impression of Change-Vitiligo (F- and T-PaGIC). 
•  Other endpoints: (Children’s) Dermatology Life Quality Index ((C)DLQI), Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), WHO-5, the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 
(TSQM), and the Vitiligo-specific Quality-of-life instrument (VitiQoL). 
•  Sample size 
The sample size was calculated to provide at least 85% power to detect a difference between the 1.5% 
BID with vehicle BID in primary and key secondary endpoints and was calculated based on response 
rates observed in study INCB 18424-211 (response rate F-VASI75 in ruxolitinib group 20% versus 5% 
in vehicle group). The Fisher’s exact test with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 was used. At least 300 were 
anticipated to be included in each pivotal trial; adolescents had to make up at least 10% of the study 
population. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to ruxolitinib 1.5% BID or vehicle BID, stratified by 
baseline skin type (Fitzpatrick scale Type I and II vs Type III, IV, V, and VI) and region (North America 
or Europe). Sponsor, investigators, and participants were blinded for treatment allocation. 
Investigators and participants kept blinding until the end of the study (week 52). Unblinding during the 
study was only allowed in case of a medical emergency; the participant was then withdrawn from 
study treatment.  
•  Statistical methods 
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted on clinical study participation, which led to both increased 
discontinuations and missed efficacy assessments. To minimise potential bias from missing values and 
impact on study interpretation, the sponsor considered the following changes to the protocol-defined 
analyses, which were specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan:  
• 
The FAS was planned to replace the ITT population in the evaluation of efficacy for the 24-
week, double-blind period. However, based on feedback from the FDA, the primary population 
for efficacy analyses was changed back to the ITT population after unblinding.  
•  Multiple imputation was used to replace NRI as the primary method for handling missing values 
in the analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints.  
The ITT population included all randomised participants. Treatment groups for this population were 
defined according to the treatment assignment at randomisation. The ITT population was used for the 
analyses of efficacy and summaries of demographics, baseline characteristics, and participant 
disposition. The PP population included all participants in the ITT population excluding participants with 
important protocol deviations.  
The FAS population included all participants in the ITT population that have baseline and any 
postbaseline assessments.  
The primary endpoint analysis was performed using exact logistic regression and tested the primary 
alternative hypothesis (superiority of ruxolitinib cream vs vehicle) at Week 24. This model included the 
treatment group and stratification factors of skin type (Fitzpatrick scale Type I and II or Type III, IV, V, 
and VI) and geographic region (North America or Europe). The unadjusted p-value between the 1.5% 
BID group versus vehicle was compared at 2-sided α = 0.05 level. Odds ratio and 95% CIs in response 
rates (ruxolitinib cream vs vehicle) at Week 24 were also computed. The primary endpoint was also 
examined for the PP population using the same model as the primary analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 72/152 
 
 
 
Missing data for the F-VASI assessment at a given visit in the double-blind period was handled using 
multiple imputation under the missing-at-random assumption. For multiple imputation, a fully 
conditional specification method that assumed the existence of a joint distribution for all variables was 
used to impute the numerical score. 
Sensitivity analyses performed on the primary endpoint are:  
•  Non-responder imputation. Participants who are missing postbaseline values were defined as 
non-responders.  
• 
Last observed non-missing post-baseline value was used to fill in missing values at Week 24.  
•  A tipping point sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the potential effects of missing 
data. The missing F-VASI75 response at Week 24 in each treatment group was replaced by a 
range of values from the most conservative case (all missing is non-response) to the most 
aggressive case (all missing is response).  
Key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses for binary outcomes (F-VASI50/90, T-VASI50, and VNS 
response) were performed using similar methods to those specified in the analysis of the primary 
endpoint. For the continuous outcome (the percent change from baseline in F-BSA at Week 24) an 
ANCOVA model was used with treatment group, stratification factors, and baseline value as covariates.  
A gatekeeping testing strategy for the primary and key secondary analyses was implemented 
to control the overall Type I error rate, 2-sided α = 0.05. These endpoints were tested in a fixed 
sequence at 2-sided α = 0.05 level in the following order: F-VASI75, F-VASI50, F-VASI90, T-VASI50, 
VNS and F-BSA, all at Week 24. The endpoint was tested only if the null hypothesis for the primary 
endpoint (and the secondary endpoints in previous steps) was rejected.  
For continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, a mixed-effect model with repeated measurements 
was fit for the comparisons between 1.5% BID cream group and vehicle cream group. For categorical 
secondary endpoints, a similar exact logistic regression models as specified in the primary and key 
secondary analysis was used if applicable.  
Subgroup analyses on response rate differences for the primary endpoint were performed for the 
following participant characteristics and baseline variables:  
•  Skin type (Fitzpatrick scale Type I and II vs Type III, IV, V, VI)  
•  Age (12 to 17, ≥ 18 to 64, ≥ 65 years; ≤ 40, > 40 years)  
•  Region (North America, Europe)  
•  Sex (Male, Female)  
•  Race  
• 
F-BSA (<1.5, ≥1.5)  
Furthermore, separate analyses were performed for the primary and key secondary outcomes in 
adolescents compared to adults as to provide evidence for inclusion of this subgroup in the indication.  
No formal interim analysis was planned in these studies.

the 661 participants randomised, 660 (99.8%) applied ruxolitinib 1.5% BID at least once, and 583 
(88.2%) completed the double-blind period. Study discontinuation was similar between treatment 
arms and studies.  
A total of 569 participants (n = 283 in study INCB 18424-306 and n = 286 in study INCB 18424-307) 
applied ruxolitinib 1.5% BID at least once in the treatment extension period; 513 participants (90.2%) 
completed treatment through week 52 (n = 256 in study 306 and n = 257 in study 307).  
•  Recruitment 
Study INCB 18424-306 started collecting data on September 20 in 2019, and study INCB 18424-307 
started collecting on October 3, 2019. Both studies were completed in the first quarter of 2022. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The applicant stated that all studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles 
originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with the International Council on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices Guidelines. The studies were performed in accordance with 
applicable laws and country-specific regulations in which the studies were conducted. 
The protocol was amended at three time-points (October 31, 2019; December 12, 2019; February 21, 
2020).  The  first  amendment  mainly  aimed  at  incorporating  revisions  requested  by  the  Voluntary 
Harmonisation Procedure (VHP).  
Relevant issues in the amendments were:  
• 
The addition of (the option for participation in the sub-study involving) exit interview at week 
24 and 52.  
•  Removal of the statement that hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with 
the investigational product which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method, was 
described as this was considered specific for oral ruxolitinib rather than topical since the 
systemic exposure was considered to be low.  
•  A change in the description of how to handle participants not meeting the eligibility criteria, 
which was changed from ‘may discontinue’ to 'must discontinue'.  
•  Revision of the per protocol population and clarification of the primary analysis. 
•  Revision of the key secondary endpoints and an update of the analysis plan 
•  Removal of stratification criteria by age and adding stratification by region.  
•  Addition of an exclusion criterion, i.e., exclusion of other forms of vitiligo to the population 
section.  
Most amendments were considered minor by the applicant. The replacement of stratification criteria by 
age with stratification by region was not considered to have had a negative impact on the study results 
by the applicant. 
Following an audit, the data of site 710 were excluded from the efficacy analyses. This decision was 
due to one critical finding (informed consent) and two major findings (source documents and 
organisation and personnel). The analyses were repeated with the centre excluded, and the main 
analyses with and without the centre were comparable.  
•  Baseline data 
Demographic variables were balanced between the two studies, as well as between the vehicle and 
the ruxolitinib groups. Mean (sd) age of the pooled population (comprising studies 306 and 307) was 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 75/152 
 
 
 
40 (15) years, ranging from 12 to 79 years. Adolescents between 12 - 18 years of age represented 
10.9% (n = 72) of the pooled population; those aged 65 years or older represented 6.8% (n = 45). A 
total of 54% (n = 354) was female and most participants had Fitzpatrick skin type II, III, or IV (89%, 
n = 590). Mean (sd) body mass index was 27 (5.2). Most participants (82%, n = 542) were of white 
race; black and African Americans were represented by 4.7% (n = 31) of the participants.  
Medical history was also balanced between the two studies, as well as between the vehicle and the 
ruxolitinib groups (Table 19). Mean (sd) years since diagnosis was 15 (12) years with a range from 0 
to 60.5 years. In 63% (n = 419) the diagnosis was set during adulthood and in 74% (n = 486) the 
disease was stable. Total percentage of affected body surface area was on average (sd) 7.4% (2.0).  
Baseline disease characteristics were overall balanced between the two studies, as well as between 
the vehicle and the ruxolitinib groups (Table 19). The median (range) F-VASI at baseline was 0.70 (0.4 
– 3.0) in both treatment groups over the two studies. The average (range) facial BSA was 1% (0.5% - 
3.0%). Median T-VASI at baseline was about 6.7 over the two studies, and the average (range) total 
BSA affected by vitiligo was 7% (3% - 10%). Thirty-eight percent of all participants was treatment-
naïve; phototherapy and topical calcineurin inhibitors were the most common prior therapies (32% of 
the participants), followed by topical corticosteroids (28%).

Study drug exposure  
Duration of treatment in days, the median weight of study drug applied in grams, and the median total 
weight of study drug applied in grams during the double-blind period were numerically comparable 
between the two studies and between the vehicle and ruxolitinib groups (Table 20).

18424-307) of the participants during the double-blind period, without notable differences between the 
vehicle and ruxolitinib groups. By WHO drug class, most commonly used medications were thyroid 
hormones (19.1% in study 306 and 14.6% in study 307), priopionic acids derivates (14.8% and 
9.6%), (multi)vitamins (7.9% and 7.9%). HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (8.2% and 6.4%), and 
anilides (7.3% and 12.8%). Most commonly used medications by WHO term were ibuprofen (10.9% in 
study 306 and 7.3% in study 307), levothyroxine (sodium) (17.9% and 14.3%), and paracetamol 
(5.2% and 9.3%). These concomitant medications were in line with the protocol. Data from study site 
710 are still included in this section. 
•  Numbers analysed 
Data from the intention to treat (ITT) population constituted the primary analysis set. It consisted of n 
= 109 and n = 221 (100%) participants in the vehicle and ruxolitinib groups respectively for study 
306, and n = 109 (100%) and n = 222 (100%) respectively for study 307 (numbers without study site 
710). The per protocol population included randomised participants who were considered to be 
sufficiently compliant with the protocol. For study 306 it included the same numbers as the ITT 
population for both treatment groups study (n = 221 (100%) and n = 109 (100%); for study 307

these numbers were lower, i.e., 99/109 (91%) and 203/222 (91%) respectively (numbers without 
study site 710).   
For study 306, 90 participants in the vehicle group entered the treatment extension (TE) phase from 
whom 82 (91%) completed the 52-weeks of treatment; for ruxolitinib 193 participants entered the TE 
phase and 174 (90%) completed treatment. For study 307, 102 participants in the vehicle group 
entered the TE phase from whom 81 (83%) completed the 52-weeks of treatment; for ruxolitinib 206 
participants entered the TE phase and 182 (92%) completed treatment.  
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome 
In both studies, the primary endpoint was met. The proportion of participants reaching F-VASI75 at 24 
weeks (primary outcome), was significantly higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group versus the vehicle 
BID group in both pivotal studies. In the pooled data of both studies, the average proportion of 
responders in the ruxolitinib group was 31% compared to 9.6% in the vehicle group with a response 
rate difference of 21% (p < 0.0001) (Table 22). Pre-planned sensitivity analyses using NRI and using 
LOCF yielded comparable results; post hoc analyses of the primary endpoint including data from site 
710 yielded similar results as well. As early as week 12, a treatment effect of ruxolitinib in F-VASI75 
appeared, and the proportions of participants reaching F-VASI75 continued to increase until weeks 
42/46 and then the effect seems to flatten (Figure 17).

Population); pooled data from studies INCB 18424-306 and -307 
Note: Data from study site 710 were excluded.  
Key secondary outcomes 
The findings for the key secondary outcomes were in line with the primary outcome: all met statistical 
significance in both studies, favoring ruxolitinib 1.5% BID over vehicle BID at 24 weeks of treatment. 
The treatment effects (ruxolitinib versus vehicle) were numerically quite similar for the two pivotal 
studies (Table 23). Presented data are updated, excluding those from participants from study site 710. 
In the pooled results, 51.7% of the participants in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group and 19.6% in the 
vehicle group achieved at least 50% repigmentation after 24 weeks of treatment (F-VASI50), with a 
response rate difference of 32.2% (p<0.0001) (Table 23, Figure 18).  
Almost complete repigmentation (F-VASI90) was reached in 16% in the ruxolitinib group versus 1.9% 
in the vehicle group after 24 weeks of treatment, with a response rate difference of 14.2% (p < 
0.0001) (Table 23, Figure 19).  
Proportions of participants reaching at least 50% repigmentation of the total body after 24 weeks (T-
VASI50) were 21.9% in participants on ruxolitinib versus 5.8% of the participants in the vehicle 
group, with a response rate difference of 16.1% (p<0.0001) (Table 23, Figure 20).  
The proportion of patients who scored their vitiligo (VNS) as ‘a lot less noticeable’ or ‘no longer 
noticeable’ after 24 weeks was larger in the group of participants treated with ruxolitinib (22.5%) as 
compared to those treated with vehicle (4.2%), with a treatment effect of 18.3% (p<0.0001) (Table 
23, Figure 21).  
The percent change in F-BSA at week 24 was significantly higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group 
versus vehicle BID (LSM difference -20.0 (sd 3.17)) with a 95% CI of -26.22 - -13.77 (p<0.0001) 
(Table 23, Figure 22). 
Sensitivity analysis yielded comparable results as compared to the primary analyses of the key 
secondary outcomes; post hoc analyses including data from site 710 yielded similar results as well.

Other secondary outcomes 
Proportions of patients reaching the F-VASI75, F-VASI50, F-VASI90, T-VASI50, VNS score 4 
or 5, and changes in F-BSA, F-VASI, and T-VASI during both the double-blind 24 weeks period as 
well as during the treatment extension phase up to 52 weeks are presented in the below figures. 
Generally, a differentiation between the treatment responses for the vehicle and ruxolitinib groups 
emerges at about 12 weeks, and the responses further improve until week 52. A trend was suggested 
towards flattening of the response after week 40/46 especially for the facial endpoints (F-VASI). Those 
starting ruxolitinib after initial treatment with vehicle showed an expected catch up in treatment 
responses.

These findings were confirmed by the shift summary data on the maintenance of response for the F-
VASI and the T-VASI as calculated with the completed dataset (see Table 24 and Table 25). For the 
F-VASI less than 15% of the participants deteriorated one or more categories at week 52 compared to 
week 24; between 50-68% of the participants improved at least one category between week 24 and 
52. For the T-VASI less than 26% of the participants deteriorated one or more categories at week 52

Updated results for the other secondary endpoints physician and patient assessments of improvement 
of vitiligo (F-PhGVA, T-PhGVA, F-PaGIC-V, T-PaGIC-V, and Color-matching question) until week 
52 are presented in Table 26. These endpoints were not included in the multiple-testing procedure; 
thus p-values are nominal. Overall, improvements were seen at week 24 compared to baseline, with 
some further improvement until week 52; a catch up was observed for those initially assigned to 
vehicle starting ruxolitinib after 24 weeks.

•  Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Response rate differences for the F-VASI75 at week 24 were in favor of ruxolitinib as compared to 
vehicle in all predefined subgroups. Subgroups for race, except white race, were too small to draw 
conclusions (Figure 27).

Note: Data from participants enrolled at Site 710 in Study INCB 18424-307 were excluded. 
Subgroup analyses were also performed (ad hoc) for the F-VASI75 at week 24 by disease status and 
prior therapy showed numerically comparable response rates for the subgroups, all favoring ruxolitinib 
1.5% BID versus vehicle BID (Table 28).

Additional ad hoc subgroup analyses for adolescents were performed for the primary and secondary 
endpoints (see Figure 28). Those assigned to the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group showed better outcome 
compared to those assigned to the vehicle group; response rate differences were in line with, or even 
more favorable, compared to those in adults.

Notes  
A statistically significantly higher proportion of participants reached primary and key secondary endpoints 
F-VASI75, F-VASI90, T-VASI50, and score 4 or 5 for VNS in the ruxolitinib group versus the vehicle 
group. 
Note: Data from participants enrolled at Site 710 in Study INCB 18424-307 were excluded. 
2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No separate clinical studies in special populations with vitiligo were performed. Subgroup analysis for 
adolescents was performed for the primary outcome measure only, as described in the section on 
subgroups above. Adolescents between 12 - 18 years of age represented 10.9% (n = 72) of the pooled 
population; those aged 65 years or older represented 6.8% (n = 45). 
2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Not applicable. 
2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled analyses were performed for the two pivotal studies. These data are integrated in the section of 
main studies and in the section on subgroup analysis. Data on response shifts are presented below. 
In the pooled study data, there were 350 participants with F-VASI data at weeks 24 and 52. Among 
the 133 (33%) participants who had less than 25% repigmentation (<F-VASI25) at week 24, 
approximately 58% improved in F-VASI response, with 13% reaching F VASI75 at week 52 (Table 31). 
Among participants with <T VASI25 at week 24, approximately 57% improved in T-VASI response, 
with 23% reaching T VASI50 at week 52 (Table 32). Of the participants with an F-VASI<25% or a T-
VASI<25% at week 52, about 50% showed improvements up to week 68 but few patients reached F-
VASI75 or T-VASI75 (Table 33 and Table 34).

2.6.5.6.  Supportive studies 
Study NCBI 18424-308 
Data of study NCBI 18424-308, the treatment extension study, was considered supportive for the 
long-term efficacy of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. Study 308 is still ongoing and data from cohort A will 
remain blinded until the study is completed by all participants. Preliminary data from cohort B were 
provided, including participants who had not reached the F-VASI 90 at week 52 in studies INCB 18424-
306 or INCB 18424-307 and continued the use of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. At time of data cut off all 
participants in cohort B had completed 68 weeks of treatment. Proportions of participants reaching the 
F-VASI75, the F-VASI90, and the T-VASI50 are provided in the below figures. According to the 
applicant, these preliminary data support continuous improvement in repigmentation, also after 52 
weeks use of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID.  
Data on rebound is to be expected from cohort A from study 308 in the first half of 2023.

Study INCB 18424-211 
Data of study INCB 18424-211 was considered supportive for the long-term efficacy of ruxolitinib 1.5% 
BID as during the initial application no long-term data beyond 24 weeks was available for studies INCB 
18424-306 and -307. Upon CHMP’s request, data of studies 306 and 307 were submitted by the

applicant. The numbers in study 211 on ruxolitinib 1.5% BID are low, the supportive value of study 
211 mainly concerns the data on rebound effects after treatment discontinuation rather than for long-
term clinical efficacy.  
Rebound was defined as an F-VASI score during the follow-up period of ≥ 25% than the F-VASI score 
at baseline (n = 70). None of the participants (except a single participant with segmental vitiligo) met 
this definition. More data on rebound is to be expected from study 308 (cohort A) in the first half of 
2023. 
Exit interviews and associations between clinical outcomes 
Exit interviews were performed in participants who finished the pivotal studies. The interviews aimed, 
amongst others, at confirming the threshold of clinical meaningful improvement in the F-VASI, and to 
identify thresholds for meaningful change in the T-VASI and the VNS. Thirty-six participants were 
interviewed on their interpretation of meaningful changes at the F-VASI, T-VASI, and VNS scores. The 
previously set threshold for meaningful improvement at the F-VASI at 75% was supported by the 
results of the interviews. Similarly, the threshold for meaningful improvement at the T-VASI was 50% 
and for the VNS this was 3-5. However, number of patients involved was limited. 
The study of associations between different outcome measures at baseline of the two pivotal studies 
were performed to support their respective validity. Correlations were calculated between the F-VASI 
and the F-PhGVA (r = 0.310, n = 648), and between the T-VASI and the T-PhGVA (r = 0.339, n = 
648), but not between the VNS and any other outcome measure. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The developmental programme of topical ruxolitinib was broad and included clinical studies in vitiligo, 
but also in atopic dermatitis, plaque psoriasis, and alopecia areata (see section 2.6 for an overview). 
For vitiligo, one phase 2 study (INCB 18424-211) was performed for dose finding and long-term 
efficacy and safety. Based on the results of this study, ruxolitinib 1.5% BID (the highest dose 
evaluated) was used for the subsequent two identically designed pivotal phase 3 studies (INCB 18424-
306 and -307) on efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients with non-segmental vitiligo (NSV). The 
studies were all completed. Data from the maintenance and withdrawal study (INCB 18424-308) are 
expected in the first half of 2023 and will be submitted for review. 
Main studies 
Studies INCB 18424-306 and INCB 18424-307 were the pivotal, identical phase 3 studies comparing 
ruxolitinib 1.5% BID with vehicle cream BID in participants with NSV. These studies were completed 
during the current procedure. Supportive studies were study INCB18424-308 (treatment maintenance 
and withdrawal study) which is still ongoing, and dose-finding study INCB 18424-211 (completed). The 
comparator chosen in the pivotal studies was vehicle cream and this is acceptable since other available 
therapies are not well established.  
The (identical) design of the two pivotal studies was adequate and followed the study objectives. There 
are no specific guidelines on the design of studies for vitiligo, but Scientific Advice of the CHMP was 
sought in March 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/1155/3/2019/III). In this CHMP SA, a double-blind period of >24 
weeks was recommended because 24 weeks was considered potentially too short to reach (full) re-
pigmentation. Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant provided complete data up to week 52 for each of 
the primary and (key) secondary endpoints for the two pivotal studies, and additionally provided 
supportive, preliminary long-term data up to week 68 from study INCB 18424-308. This follow-up is 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 100/152 
 
 
 
 
considered sufficiently long for an adequate benefit-risk assessment for efficacy (and safety) of 
ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. Data on maintenance (but not withdrawal) from study 308 were preliminary and 
not complete, but this was considered not required for the current application. The final results will be 
submitted for review once available (i.e. in the first half of 2023).  
Study participants 
The in- and exclusion criteria were in line with the target population as defined in the proposed 
indication, i.e. “treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents 
from 12 years of age". The inclusion criteria defined an eligible population with a relatively mild 
phenotype of NSV; the total body surface area (BSA) affected by vitiligo (facial and non-facial) should 
not be exceeding 10%. This 10% corresponded to the maximum % BSA to be treated in the pivotal 
studies 306 and 307.  In study 211, patients with more extensive disease were included as well. 
Response rates in study 211 was similar to the response rates seen in the pivotal trials and so was the 
safety patterns. Specifically, in those participants who presented with > 20% BSA, but who were only 
permitted to treat up to 20% BSA, the response rates for F-VASI50 and F-VASI75 and the safety 
profile were similar to those who presented with ≤ 20% BSA affected. Nevertheless, in the absence of 
long-term safety data, the CHMP agreed that the maximum BSA to be treated (10%) should be 
included in SmPC section 4.2. In addition, a warning in SmPC section 4.4 was added to reflect that in 
the absence of long-term safety data the skin area to be treated should be as limited as possible and 
not exceed the recommended posology for vitiligo (see also safety discussion). Another aspect in the 
proposed indication concerned ‘…vitiligo with facial involvement…’; participants in the two pivotal 
studies were selected accordingly. However, it is unclear if and why facial involvement will be 
necessary for patients to be eligible for treatment with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID, when authorised. The 
CHMP acknowledged that it is likely the most debilitating manifestation of the disease, but whether 
treatment should be confined to patients with facial involvement for efficacy reasons could be 
questioned. Nevertheless, this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP, and the proposed indication 
was thus considered acceptable. 
Treatment-naïve as well as participants who achieved previous treatment were included in the pivotal 
studies. The proposed indication does not incorporate a treatment-line, in line with the CHMP Scientific 
Advice received. This can be accepted as results indicated there was no relevant heterogeneity in 
results across lines of treatment. Furthermore, there are no available authorised treatments in vitiligo 
and for none of the alternative treatments, efficacy has been established in randomised trials. 
Study treatments 
Participants were treated with either vehicle cream BID or ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID. Topical 
treatment inherently introduced dosing and compliance issues, but reasonable effort was made to 
evaluate these aspects. Compliance was defined as 70%-130% of the expected number of applications 
to be reached.  
The ruxolitinib dosing regimen was defined as 1.5% BID to be applied on up to 10% BSA. There were 
two points of discussion arising with this choice: 1) BID versus QD, and 2) the limit of 10% BSA.  
Ad 1) During the CHMP SA of 2019, the 1.5% QD regimen was selected, based on the F-VASI50 at 
week 24 in study 211 as well as anticipated lower systemic exposure. The 1.5% BID regimen was 
however selected for the pivotal studies 306 and 307, based on the F-VASI75 at 52 weeks in study 
211. This is understood as the largest responses in F-VASI75 were indeed seen with the 1.5% BID 
dose at week 24 and beyond, and the F-VASI75 is more stringent than the F-VASI50. Although the BID 
regimen is associated with a higher level of (systemic) exposure as compared to QD, this exposure is 
still considered to be low and did not result in new or more severe safety issues compared to what had 
been observed for the 1.5% QD regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 101/152 
 
 
 
 
Ad 2) In study 211 the maximum area to be treated was 20% BSA, but this was reduced to 10% BSA 
in the pivotal studies and this threshold was also reflected in the proposed posology in SmPC section 
4.2. The 10% BSA was chosen as application to a larger area would become impractical and thus to 
improve treatment compliance and to decrease patient burden. Furthermore, the applicant highlighted 
that this 10% BSA was a common threshold described in several guidelines on topical therapy for 
vitiligo. As the hands and face, usually the most visible body areas in Europe, together form ~10% 
BSA, treatment up to 10% BSA was ultimately considered as clinically relevant for the treatment of 
vitiligo by the CHMP. See also section on study participants above.  
Outcomes 
The endpoints chosen in the pivotal studies 306 and 307 were discussed in the 2019 CHMP Scientific 
Advice and covered in the literature and are thus considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Primary outcome was the proportion of participants reaching at least 75% facial repigmentation at 24 
weeks (F-VASI75). Key secondary outcomes were proportions of participants reaching the F-VASI50, 
F-VASI90, the T-VASI50, and VNS score 4 or 5, and the percentage of change of F-BSA, at week 24. 
The F-VASI75, the T-VASI 50, and the VNS were considered the most relevant outcomes for this 
application. 
The F- and the T-VASI were based on the validated, original VASI, and adjusted for the purpose of the 
pivotal studies. As the F- and T-VASI are fundamentally overlapping with the original VASI, it seemed 
justified to assume that their psychometric properties are likely to approach those of the original 
VASI. The PhGVA and PaGIC were similarly adjusted (F-PhGVA, T-PhGVA, F-PaGIC-V, T-PaGIC-V); 
although no comprehensive data on psychometric properties were available for these supportive 
endpoints, these endpoints were indeed not among the primary or key secondary outcomes and were 
face valid and easy to understand for participants. Additional data on psychometric properties were 
thus considered not warranted. 
Sample size, randomisation, and blinding 
Sample size calculations were based on treatment effects observed in study 211 which is justified. The 
randomisation and blinding procedures were considered acceptable. 
Statistical analyses 
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted study participants and conduct. Therefore, the applicant decided to 
define the FAS as efficacy population in the SAP rather than the protocol defined ITT population. After 
unblinding, the population was changed back to ITT based on FDA feedback. The change was made 
after unblinding, however since the results were similar between the analysis using FAS and the ITT 
population, the post-hoc change did not have an impact on the primary analyses. 
The definition of the analysis populations was standard. The primary endpoint was analysed using 
exact logistic regression including the stratification factors used at randomisation. Missing primary 
endpoint data were handled using multiple imputation, assuming missing at random. This is acceptable 
and the impact on the results was adequately tested in sensitivity analyses (non-response imputation, 
LOCF imputation and a tipping point analysis).  
Key secondary endpoints were analysed using similar methods as for the primary endpoint, other 
secondary endpoints were analysed as appropriate. Multiplicity across the primary and key secondary 
endpoints was handled by a sequential testing strategy, to control the overall type I error rate and is 
considered acceptable.

Conduct of the study 
Although there were several protocol amendments, these did not affect the conduct and outcome of 
the pivotal studies. The protocol amendment in which the exclusion criterion ‘other forms than 
nonsegmental vitiligo’ was introduced, appeared to be a textual one and did not have impact on the 
actual selection of participants: only participants with NSV were included in the studies. 
Three investigator inspections and 5 site audits were reported by the applicant. The three clinical 
investigator inspections did not lead to remarkable GCP findings. Based on the audit of study site 710 
(included in study INCB 18424-307), it was decided to exclude all participants from the analyses due 
to 1 critical finding (informed consent) and two major findings (source documents and organisation and 
personnel). Other GCP inspections were not performed. This is accepted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study population 
Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the vehicle and the ruxolitinib groups, as well 
as between the two pivotal studies. Adolescents comprised about 10% of the study sample. The group 
of participants aged 65 years or older comprised 6.8% in total. Females were slightly overrepresented. 
Non-white participants (18%) were underrepresented compared to the incidence of vitiligo in this 
population. It was hypothesised that a satisfactory re-pigmentation result may be more difficult to 
reach in those with a non-white skin type. The subgroup analysis for the F-VASI75 stratified by skin 
type I-II versus III – VI did not reveal differences in outcome, suggesting that for both white and non-
white skin the response rates were comparable although the heterogeneity within the subgroups was 
large. Also, when stratified by race no clear differences in outcome were seen, but the numbers in the 
non-white subgroups were small. Altogether, the subgroup analyses did not suggest a trend towards 
between-group differences. This issue was therefore not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Completion 
A total of 674 participants was included in the pivotal studies. Data from participants from study site 
710 were ultimately excluded from the analyses (n = 13; see section on conduct of the study above); 
data from 661 participants were eligible for the analyses (218 in vehicle and 443 in ruxolitinib 1.5% 
BID groups respectively). The numbers (13% - 11%) and reasons of discontinuation or withdrawal 
before week 24 were similar between vehicle and ruxolitinib groups and both studies. Up to week 52, 
163 (88.6%) and 350 (90.9%) of the participants in the vehicle and the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID groups 
completed the study. Reasons for discontinuation (withdrawal by participant and lost to follow up) were 
comparable between the two groups. Numbers analysed in the ITT population did not substantially 
differ across treatments groups and studies.  
Adherence and drug exposure 
Median duration of treatment was 168 days during the double-blind period, with an average total 
amount of study drug applied of 678 grams. Drug exposure was comparable between the two studies 
and between the vehicle and ruxolitinib group. Compliance of > 80% of the drug applications was 
achieved in > 89.7%, irrespective of treatment group or study. There were few protocol violations due 
to non-adherence. Adherence and study drug exposure were presented for the population including 
those from study site 710 because the patients are part of the safety data.  
Concomitant medication 
Concomitant medication was taken by about 70% of the participants during the double-blind period in 
both studies, without differences between the vehicle and ruxolitinib group. It is unlikely that the use 
of concomitant medication has affected the outcome of the pivotal studies.

Combination therapy 
As ruxolitinib cream has not been evaluated in combination with other medicinal products used to treat 
vitiligo, SmPC section 4.5 was updated to reflect that co-application on the same skin areas is not 
recommended. In addition, limited data are available on the use of phototherapy in combination with 
ruxolitinib cream from study 211. The applicant highlighted that a study was ongoing to examine the 
impact of concomitant UV treatment; the SmPC will be updated in a future variation, if considered 
appropriate.  
Emollients and Sunscreen 
Upon CHMP’s request, SmPC section 4.5 was updated to include recommendations on the concomitant 
use of emollients and sunscreen.  
Treatment effects  
In both pivotal studies, the primary endpoint was met. The proportion of participants reaching F-
VASI75 at 24 weeks was significantly higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5 % BID group versus the vehicle BID 
group (30% versus 7.4% and 31% versus 11.4% respectively in studies 306 and 307).  
Higher proportions of participants treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID versus vehicle BID reached the 
primary outcome (F-VASI75 at week 24): 31% versus 9.6% respectively using pooled data, and this 
difference was statistically significant in both studies. The robustness of the findings was supported by 
sensitivity analyses. Analyses with and without the data from study site 710 yielded comparable 
outcome (see below).  
Data from key secondary outcomes (F-VASI50, F-VASI90, T-VASI50, Vitiligo Noticeability Scale score 4 
or 5, F-BSA at week 24) were in line with the primary outcome. In the pooled results, 52% of the 
participants in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group and 21% in the vehicle group reached at least 50% 
repigmentation after 24 weeks of treatment (F-VASI50), with a response rate difference of 31% 
(p<0.0001). Almost complete repigmentation (F-VASI90) was reached in 16% in the ruxolitinib group 
versus 1.9% in the vehicle group after 24 weeks of treatment, with a response rate difference of 14% 
(p = 0.0001). Proportions of participants reaching at least 50% repigmentation of the total body after 
24 weeks (T-VASI50) were 22% in participants on ruxolitinib versus 6% of the participants in the 
vehicle group, with a response rate difference of 16% (p<0.0001). The proportion of patients who 
scored their vitiligo (VNS) as ‘a lot less noticeable’ or ‘no longer noticeable’ after 24 weeks was larger 
in the group of participants treated with ruxolitinib (23%) as compared to those treated with vehicle 
(4.2%), with a treatment effect of 18% (p<0.0001). The percent change in F-BSA at week 24 was 
significantly higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group versus vehicle BID (LSM difference -20.0 (sd 
3.2)) with a 95% CI of -26.2 - -13.8 (p<0.0001). Results showed to be robust in the sensitivity 
analyses.  
Altogether, data from pivotal studies 306 and 307 included 661 patients up to week 52, excluding 
those of 13 patients from site 710 where major protocol violations were observed. The impact of these 
13 excluded subjects was marginal: at week 24, the re-calculated estimated F-VASI75 response rate 
without the 13 subjects from site 710 was not different from the estimated F-VAS75 previously 
reported including those subjects (30.7% versus 30.1% for ruxolitinib 1.5% BID, with response rate 
differences of 21.1% versus 19.3%). For the key secondary outcomes (F-VASI50, F-VASI90, T-VASI50 
and the VNS score 4 or 5 at week 24) similar results were found, concluding that the data of these 13 
subjects did not affect interpretation of the results.  
Other outcome secondary outcomes generally supported these findings, but there were no statistically 
significant between-group differences in changes in quality of life (DLQI/CDLQI, WHO-5 and VitiQol) 
and anxiety/depression (HADS) possibly due to low baseline scores.

Onset of effect and long-term treatment effect 
Visual inspection of the effects of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID over time as compared to vehicle BID showed 
that the treatment effect of ruxolitinib can be observed from week 12, however this was not formally 
tested. Long-term data until week 52 (pivotal trials 306 and 307) and beyond (preliminary data cohort 
B study 308; participants in this cohort had < F-VASI90 at Week 52 in the Phase 3 studies and 
continued on open-label ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID up to Week 104) showed that repigmentation 
continues after week 24. Further improvement is seen for the primary and key secondary outcome 
measures until week 52, about 50% showed improvements up to week 68 but few patients reached F-
VASI75 or T-VASI75. In general, the response to treatment in vitiligo took more time than in other 
inflammatory diseases, due to the lag-time in the regeneration following a reduction of the 
inflammatory process. The data showed that patients who did not have a response by week 24 may 
get a response before week 52, and that patients who did not have response by week 52 however 
have little chance to get a response later. Considering the low systemic exposure, a 52-week cut-off 
for non-response in case of vitiligo is considered appropriate. This information has been adequately 
reflected in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Maintenance of effect and treatment withdrawal 
Data on withdrawal of treatment will come from cohort A (including participants who had reached the 
F-VASI90 at week 52 and were randomised into treatment continuation or discontinuation) from study 
INCB 18424-308 which is currently ongoing. Data are expected to be available in the first half of 2023.  
Further, data on rebound after treatment withdrawal were derived by post hoc analyses of data from 
study 211 including 70 participants who discontinued ruxolitinib (independent of dose) during the open 
label extension period. None (except one participant with segmental vitiligo) met the definition of 
rebound (F-VASI score during follow-up of at least 25% higher than the F-VASI at baseline). It is 
therefore considered unlikely that treatment discontinuation will trigger a rebound effect. Given the 
available data, this conclusion is endorsed. Nevertheless, definite data are expected after completion of 
study 308.  
The applicant will submit a type II variation to implement these results in the SmPC after the data 
become available. This is accepted.  
Adolescents 
Adolescents (12 - 18 years) are included in the proposed indication and comprised about 10% (n=72) 
of the total study population. Subgroup analyses for the F-VASI75 as well as for the key secondary 
outcomes showed comparable percentages responders in the ruxolitinib group compared to vehicle at 
week 24. This, supported by the assumed similar pathophysiological mechanism of vitiligo in 
adolescents compared to adults and comparable systemic ruxolitinib exposure between adolescents 
and adults, confirmed the efficacy of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID in adolescents. Together with a similar 
safety profile (see clinical safety section) the inclusion of adolescents in the therapeutic indication 
SmPC section 4.1 is considered to be well justified and thus acceptable by the CHMP. 
Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint only. The effect on the F-VASI75 at week 
24 (primary outcome) was overall robust across the predefined subgroups. Although response rate 
differences were larger in adolescents versus those aged 18-65 years, and in participants with an F-
BSA of at least 1.5% versus < 1.5% at baseline, contrast was mainly ascribed to lower response rates 
in the vehicle group. The sample size of the subgroup adults > 65 years of age was rather small which 
affects robustness of the findings. The SmPC section 4.2 has been revised to inform HCPs that a 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 105/152 
 
 
 
 
limited number of patients aged 65 years and above have been enrolled in the clinical studies with 
ruxolitnib cream in vitiligo to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  
Supportive studies and pooled data 
Supportive data with regard to long-term treatment (up to 104 weeks) for the F-VASI75, F-VASI90, 
and T-VASI50 of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID were derived from studies INCB 18424-308 and study INCB 
18424-211. Study 308 also provided supportive data on treatment withdrawal and rebound effects 
(see section on treatment withdrawal above).  
Exit interviews and analyses on associations between outcomes from studies 306 and 307 were 
provided as supplementary supportive data. The thresholds for meaningful improvement at the F-VASI, 
T-VASI, and VNS were confirmed with the exit interviews. However, number of patients involved was 
small which limit the interpretation of these results.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the two confirmatory studies in adolescent and adult participants with non-segmental vitiligo treated 
with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID, the primary outcome was met. The results were supported by the sensitivity 
analyses and each of the key secondary outcomes, most notably the F-VASI90, the T-VASI50, and the 
Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS). Treatment with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID for 24 weeks resulted in 21% 
and 16% more participants having repigmentation of the skin of the face (F-VASI75, primary outcome) 
and of the skin in the total body (T-VASI50) respectively, as compared to vehicle. The 75% 
repigmentation of the skin of the face is considered a clinically relevant magnitude of change and this 
was supported by treatment effects seen in the patient-reported VNS. Data beyond week 24 confirm 
further improvement of treatment response (rates) between weeks 24 and 52; but patients with less 
than 25% repigmentation by week 52 are unlikely to show clinically meaningful improvement 
thereafter. 
Adolescents are included in the proposed indication but comprise only 10% (n=72 in total) of the study 
population in the pivotal studies. Subgroup analyses consistently showed comparable treatment 
responses for the primary and key secondary endpoints in adolescents compared to adults. These 
findings, together with the similar pathophysiology and comparable systemic ruxolitinib exposure 
between adolescents and adults, justify the inclusion of adolescents in the indication. 
Overall, the following proposed therapeutic indication is considered acceptable: ‘Opzelura is indicated 
for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 
years of age.’ In line with the inclusion criteria, ruxolitinib cream should be applied to depigmented 
skin areas up to a maximum of 10 % of body surface area (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).   
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The ruxolitinib cream clinical development programme included 18 studies: four studies in participants 
with vitiligo and nine studies in participants with other inflammatory skin diseases (5 studies in atopic 
dermatitis, 3 studies in psoriasis, 1 study in alopecia areata), and five skin safety studies in healthy 
participants. 
The main clinical studies that provide safety data for the current application are the ‘phase 2’ dose-
ranging study (INCB 18424-211), and the two identically designed ‘phase 3’ confirmatory studies 
(INCB 18424-306 and -307) in adolescents (10%) and adults. All three studies have been completed. 
Final data for the treatment-extension period (up to week 52) of studies 306 and 307 were made 
available in the first round of the procedure upon CHMP’s request. 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023

The date of completion of the ‘phase 2’ study was September 8, 2021, when all participants had either 
completed the 52-week double-blind period and the 104-week open label extension period (the Week 
156 visit) or discontinued early. The dates of completion of the ‘phase 3’ studies were October 21, 
2021, and October 1, 2021, when all participants had completed the 24-week double-blind period and 
the 28-week treatment extension period or had discontinued early. The treatment extension study in 
participants with vitiligo (INCB 18424-308) of patients who completed studies 306 or 307, is still 
ongoing. At the time of the cut-off date of January 28, 2022, Cohort A was still blinded. For Cohort B, 
36 participants had completed treatment through Week 104, 49 participants had discontinued 
treatment, and 256 participants were ongoing with treatment in the study. Adolescents were included 
in the two ‘phase 3’ trials 306 and 307 in Vitiligo (n=72 with n=55 assigned to ruxolitinib 1.5% 
cream). Adolescents were also included in studies in the atopic dermatitis PK study 102 (n=21 of 71 
paediatric subjects were adolescents), maximum use study 103 (n=21), and in ‘phase 3’ trials 303 and 
304 (n=245 with n=72 assigned to ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID).  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The  integrated  safety  database  included  data  from  2620  participants  evaluated  in  11  studies  (INCB 
18424-102 (cohorts 1 and 2 only), -201, -202, -203, -204, -206, -211, -303, 304, -306, and -307).  A 
total of 2263 participants applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream at least once, including 1824 participants in the 
pooled  studies,  41  participants  with  atopic  dermatitis  in  the  maximum  use  study,  and  398  healthy 
participants in the dermal safety studies. 
The primary analysis of the safety of ruxolitinib cream was based on pooled results from the 24-week, 
double-blind periods of the Phase 3 confirmatory studies (the Phase 3 Vitiligo Vehicle Controlled 
Population).  
Data pools 
The Phase 3 Vitiligo Vehicle-Controlled Population includes 673 participants distributed approximately 
2:1 between the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID and vehicle cream BID treatment groups. All participants 
had either completed treatment during the 24-week double-blind period (88%) or discontinued early 
from the study drug (12%).  
With the addition of the data of the treatment extension phase, the exposure data consisted of the 
patients exposed to vehicle cream, who were switched to ruxolitinib cream at week 24, and the 
patients who were initially randomised to ruxolitinib cream and now continued on ruxolitinib (Table 
35). All participants had completed 52 weeks of exposure to ruxolitinib or vehicle followed by 
ruxolitinib (83%), or had discontinued early (17%).

Table 35: Summary of exposure (phase 3 vitiligo vehicle-controlled population) 
The Phase 2/3 Vitiligo Population included 830 participants from studies 211, 306 and 307. At the time 
of the data cut-off, 256 participants (31%) were ongoing on treatment in the Phase 3 vitiligo treatment 
extension study (308) study, 299 participants (36%) had completed treatment, and 275 participants 
(33%) had discontinued study drug early. Among the 767 participants who applied ruxolitinib 1.5% 
cream BID in the Phase 2/3 Vitiligo Population, 546 participants (71%) were treated with ruxolitinib 
1.5% cream BID for ≥ 52 weeks. 
Ruxolitinib cream was also evaluated in other disease than vitiligo, i.e. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and 
alopecia areata. The All Ruxolitinib Cream Population included 2579 participants. Across the 1750 
participants who applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID at least once in the All Ruxolitinib Cream 
Population, 828 participants were treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID for ≥ 52 weeks, and 76 
participants were treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID for ≥ 104 weeks. Ruxolitinib cream exposure 
was 1462,9 Patient Years of exposure for the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group.  
Peadiatric population  
About 10% of all patients in the ‘phase 3’ vitiligo studies were adolescents, 55/449 (12%) were allocated 
to ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID. In the ‘phase 2’ study no adolescents were included.   
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Summary of Adverse Events 
In the pooled vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, the overall incidences of TEAEs and treatment related 
TEAEs were higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group (48% and 15%, respectively) 
versus the vehicle cream BID treatment group (35% and 7.6%, respectively); (see Table 36). A total 
of 67 (15%) of the participants in the ruxolitinib group reported ‘Application Site Reactions’, versus 13 
(5.8%) in the vehicle group. Few participants had Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, serious TEAEs, or TEAEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption, no participant had a TEAE with a fatal outcome; 
there were no differences between the ruxolitinib and the vehicle groups for these outcomes.

In adolescents, the overall incidence of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs were also higher in the 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group (56% and 16%, respectively) versus the vehicle cream 
BID treatment group (35% and 0%, respectively). In the ruxolitinib group there were more patients 
with an ‘Application Site Reaction’ than with vehicle (18% versus 0, respectively). Few participants had 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs/serious TEAEs, and in the ruxolitinib group there were no TEAEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation or interruption. No participant had a TEAE with a fatal outcome.

In the pooled treatment extension phase, the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE was 37% 
in the patients who switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib, similar to the 36% in the vehicle period, and 
was 59% in the group of patients who continued ruxolitinib (Table 37). The proportion of patients with 
a SEA or a Grade>3 TEAE, or TEAEs leading to dose discontinuation or interruption were similar in the 
vehicle and vehicle switch to ruxolitinib groups, and approximately double in the group continuing 
ruxolitinib. The proportion of patients with an ‘Application Site Reaction’ was highest in the group who 
continued ruxolitinib. Overall, low proportions of participants had Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, serious 
TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption (except for vehicle cream), and 
no participant had a TEAE with a fatal outcome.

Table 37: Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (phase 3 vitiligo vehicle controlled 
and treatment extension period, up to week 52). 
Common Adverse Events 
In the pooled vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, the treatment-emergent AEs were most frequently 
reported in the following SOCs: ‘infections and infestations’ (21.8% in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID 
treatment group vs 16.5% in the vehicle cream BID treatment group), ‘general disorders and 
administration site conditions’ (16.5% vs 6.7%, respectively), ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (5.3% vs 
2.7%, respectively), and ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (4.2% vs 5.4%, respectively). Within 
each of these SOCs, TEAEs were largely Grade 1 or 2 in severity and nonserious. Further, Treatment-
emergent AEs were more frequently reported in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group as 
compared to the vehicle cream BID treatment group, in the following SOCs: ‘investigations’ (4.7% vs 
1.8%, respectively), ‘respiratory disorders’ (3.3% vs 1.8%, respectively).  
Treatment-emergent AEs occurring in ≥ 1% of participants in the vehicle and the ruxolitinib groups are 
summarised in Table 38. Application site acne was the most common TEAE among participants who 
applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID and was reported in more participants than in the vehicle group 
(5.8% in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group vs 0.9% in the vehicle cream BID treatment 
group). Of the other common events, ‘application site pruritus’ and ‘nasopharyngitis’ were reported 
more frequently for the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group compared with the vehicle cream 
treatment group (≥2.0% higher incidence). ‘Headache’, ‘influenza’, ‘pyrexia’, ‘urinary tract infection’, 
and ‘increased ALT’ were numerically more frequent with ruxolitinib as compared to vehicle (Table 38). 
In adolescents, the most frequently occurring TEAEs (≥2%) with higher incidence in the ruxolitinib 
group as compared to the vehicle group, were: ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘covid-19’, ‘headache’, ‘application 
site acne’, ‘application site pruritis’, ‘acne’, ‘application site erythema’, ‘vomiting’.

The occurrence of common TEAEs in the pooled treatment extension phase and the pooled phase 
2/3 vitiligo studies were quite similar to each other. The pooled phase 2/3 data are presented below, 
for comprehensiveness (Table 39). Relatively common (>2%) TEAEs in participants in the ruxolitinib 
1.5% cream BID treatment group included ‘COVID-19’, ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘acne’, ‘application site 
pruritus’, ‘upper respiratory tract infection’, ‘application site acne’, ‘headache’, ‘sinusitis’, ‘pruritus’, 
‘urinary tract infection’, ‘hypertension’, ‘influenza’, and ‘oral herpes’. Events of ‘COVID-19’, 
‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘acne’, ‘upper respiratory tract infection’, ‘application site acne’, and ‘hypertension’ 
were reported more frequently for the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group compared with the 
vehicle cream treatment group (≥ 2.0% higher incidence). The common TEAEs in the pooled phase 2/3 
data were also apparent in the vehicle-controlled data.

The occurrence of Covid-19 was similar in the vehicle and ruxolitinib groups in the vehicle-controlled 
phase and was quite similar in the pooled phase2/3 data, with a IR of 5.0/100PY for vehicle and 
7.0/100PY for ruxolitinib 1.5% BID (Table 39), where there also was longer follow-up and a shift in 
calendar time for ruxolitinib 1.5% cream. The occurrence of Application site reactions (ASR) in the 
pooled phase 3 vitiligo data was 14.9% in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group and 5.8% 
in the vehicle cream BID treatment group. All of the events were nonserious, Grade 1 or 2 in severity, 
and, with the exception of 1 event of application site rash, none led to discontinuation of the study 
drug. The majority of ASR events resolved without interruption of the study drug and did not recur, 
except for acne. Application site acne (4.9% in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group vs 
0.9% in the vehicle cream BID group) and application site pruritus (4.7% vs 2.7%, respectively) were 
the most common events. Also, application site erythema, -rash, and -dermatitis occurred more 
frequently with ruxolitinib cream. Application site acne typically did not recover/resolve but did not 
lead to study drug discontinuation. Only one event of application site acne led to study drug 
interruption.  
With the update of the 52-week data, the occurrences (IR) of application site reactions, other than 
application site acne, where numerically similar in the vehicle group and vehicle to ruxolitinib group 
(observation periods) and the group who continued on ruxolitinib (Table 40).

In adolescents, a higher percentage in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID group had ASR TEAEs 
compared to older age groups, in the vehicle cream BID group no ASRs occurred (Table 41). Of the 10 
adolescent participants who had ASR TEAEs in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group, 3 had 
application site acne and 3 had application site pruritus. With the updated safety data, the occurrences 
of ASR in the adolescent participants on ruxolitinib (7% for switch group and 20% for maintenance) 
were similar to the occurrences in adults (6% and 17%), while the types of application site reactions 
were similar.

dermatitis; the same formulation, dosage form, strength, and dosing frequency were used for this 
study as was used in the vitiligo programme. A higher percentage of affected BSA was treated in this 
study (at least 25%) than in the Phase 3 vitiligo studies (up to 10%). Thirteen participants (32%) 
experienced ≥ 1 TEAE. Of these, 4 participants experienced 6 treatment
related TEAEs (dyspnea, 
neutropenia, haemoglobin decreased, AST increased [2 occurrences], and ALT increased). No ASR 
‑
TEAEs were reported in the study. 
Study INCB 18424-104 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded, within-participant comparison study to 
evaluate the skin irritation potential of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in healthy adult participants with 
Fitzpatrick skin types I through IV, using a cumulative irritation patch test design. Forty-four 
participants were enrolled in the study and 39 participants completed the study. No participants 
discontinued the patch applications due to irritation. The mean irritation score for ruxolitinib 1.5% 
cream (0.458) was statistically significantly higher than mean scores for vehicle cream (0.082, p < 
0.001) and 0.9% saline (0.111, p < 0.001) and statistically significantly lower than the mean score for 
0.2% Sodium lauryl sulfate (2.479, p < 0.001). 
Study INCB 18424-105 was a randomised, double-blind, within participant comparison study to 
evaluate the photoallergic potential of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in healthy adult participants with 
Fitzpatrick skin types I through III. In the study, application to healthy skin was followed by light 
exposure. Sixty participants were enrolled in the study and 52 participants completed the study. 
During the induction phase, a statistically significant difference was seen with the vehicle cream 
irradiated sites showing a higher irritation score than the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream irradiated sites; there 
were no dermal responses in ruxolitinib cream nor vehicle if non-irradiated. 
Study INCB 18424-106 was a single-centre, randomised, controlled, evaluator-blinded, within 
participant comparison study to evaluate the sensitisation potential of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in 
healthy adult participants with Fitzpatrick skin types I through IV. Two hundred forty-four participants 
were enrolled in the study and 214 participants completed the study. For ruxolitinib 1.5% cream, none 
of the participants showed irritation scores of 1, 2, or 3 during the challenge phase of this study. While 
0.9% saline had a higher irritation score than ruxolitinib 1.5% cream and vehicle cream, none of the 3 
tested products were classified as causing more than mild skin irritation. 
Study INCB 18424-107 was a single centre, randomised, double blind, controlled, within participant 
comparison study to evaluate the phototoxicity potential of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in healthy adult 
participants with Fitzpatrick skin types I through III. Thirty-two participants were enrolled in the study 
and 31 participants completed the study. All 3 irradiated sites (ruxolitinib 1.5% cream, vehicle cream, 
and untreated) had higher irritation scores than the nonirradiated sites (ruxolitinib 1.5% cream and 
vehicle cream) but based on the data these were considered related to the light application itself and 
not due to phototoxicity. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The applicant did propose ‘Application site acne’ to be included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC, as 
many of the application site acne apparently did not resolve. See 2.6.9 on clinical safety for further 
discussion on ADRs.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the pooled vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, SAEs were more frequent in the ruxolitinib cream 
group as compared to the vehicle group (Table 42). No serious TEAEs occurred in >1 participant in any 
treatment group, and no serious TEAE was considered related to the study drug by the investigator. No 
deaths occurred.

In the pooled treatment extension data of the vitiligo phase 3 studies, new serious TEAEs included: 
‘appendiceal abscess’, ‘joint dislocation’, ‘prostate cancer’, in the vehicle to ruxolitinib group; 
‘hypersensitivity’, ‘rhabdomyolysis’, ‘papillary thyroid cancer’, and ‘subacute combined cord 
degeneration’ in the continued ruxolitinib group. 
In the pooled ‘All ruxolitinib’ data, a total of 69 participants (2.7%) experienced ≥1 serious TEAE; 
no serious TEAEs occurred in more than 1 participant in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID group, except 
‘cholelithiasis’. Except one, no serious TEAE was considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator. The majority of events were reported as recovered/resolved and did not result in a 
change in treatment. Serious events occurring in > 1 participant in the ruxolitinib cream total group 
included ‘pneumonia’ in 4 participants, ‘’cholelithiasis in 3 participants, and ‘cerebrovascular accident’, 
‘coronary artery occlusion’, ‘prostate cancer’, and ‘sepsis’ in 2 patients each. All of these events 
recovered/resolved except for 1 event of ‘cerebrovascular accident’ (recovering/resolving) and both 
events of ‘prostate cancer’ (not recovered/not resolved).  
2.6.8.4.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
ADRs of JAK inhibitors including oral ruxolitinib were considered as AESIs. Systemic safety 
considerations with oral ruxolitinib include cytopenias (erythropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
neutropenia), risk of infections (e.g., herpes zoster), liver enzyme elevations, and observations of 
nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Serious infections, thromboembolic events, MACE, and 
malignancies are considered a safety concern for oral JAK inhibitors used in chronic inflammatory 
disorders. An analysis of lipid elevations performed for a previous submission in the US showed a low 
incidence of elevated lipid events and identified no clinically relevant trends in laboratory values. 
Therefore, lipids were not measured in the confirmatory Phase 3 vitiligo studies. The applicant 
considered the likelihood of AEs caused by systemic exposure following topical application of ruxolitinib 
cream to be low (see Pharmacokinetics and clinical safety sections for discussion). 
Cytopenias (erythropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) 
In the pooled phase 3 vitiligo data, the incidences of erythropenia TEAEs (0.4% and 0.9% of 
participants in the vehicle cream BID and ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment groups, respectively) 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023

and neutropenia TEAEs (0.4% and 0%, respectively) were low and similar between the treatment 
groups (Table 43). There were no events of thrombocytopenia in the Phase 3 vitiligo vehicle-
controlled population. All TEAEs were nonserious and Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  
One participant in the vehicle cream BID group in Study INCB 18424-306 had study drug interrupted 
after a Grade 2 TEAE of neutrophil count decreased, but the TEAE resolved, and treatment was restarted. 
All other TEAEs resolved without the need for changes to the study drug.

In the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population, the overall incidences of erythropenia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia events were low, with 0.9%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively, for the ruxolitinib cream 
total group. All of these cytopenia events were nonserious and the majority of erythropenia, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia events resolved with no action taken with the study drug. With 
inclusion of the data through Week 52 of the phase 3 studies, erythropenia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia TEAEs remained infrequent, with no meaningful imbalances in incidences by 
treatment group. 
Herpes zoster and other viral skin infections 
In the pooled phase 3 vitiligo data up to week 52, there were two participants with herpes zoster, 
both in the group who continued on ruxolitinib.  
Treatment-emergent herpes zoster events (16 events of herpes zoster and 2 events of postherpetic 
neuralgia) occurred in a total of 15 participants (all of whom applied ruxolitinib) across all studies for 
all indications in the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population including 2579 participants. All events were 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity except for 1 TEAE of herpes zoster (Grade 3) that was considered related to 
the study drug by the investigator. All herpes zoster events in participants with vitiligo resolved 
without interruption of the study drug. Clinical manifestations for the events of herpes zoster in 
participants with vitiligo were limited to cutaneous uncomplicated disease for all participants except for 
1 who had postherpetic neuralgia. All participants, with the exception of 1 participant with atopic 
dermatitis who interrupted study drug due to application site irritation, were able to continue 
ruxolitinib cream. Plasma ruxolitinib concentrations for participants with available PK concentration 
values were substantially less than the IC50 for JAK2 inhibition in whole blood assays at timepoints 
prior to the onset of the herpes zoster TEAEs in all cases but one. 
The only viral skin infections other than herpes zoster, that were identified in the clinical database 
were herpes simplex (n=9), varicella (n=1), and molluscum contagiosum (n=1). The overall incidence 
of herpes simplex in the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population was low: 0.5% for the group of patients on 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. All events of herpes simplex were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and all events 
resolved with no action taken with the study drug except for 1 event that occurred in a participant with 
atopic dermatitis during the vehicle-controlled period of a Phase 3 study.

Infections and Infestations 
In the pooled phase 3 vitiligo data, the most frequently reported (≥ 2%) infections for participants 
who applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID were ‘nasopharyngitis’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘upper respiratory tract 
infection’, and ‘sinusitis’ (Table 44). All infections and infestations were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and 
nonserious with the exception of the following four events: ‘appendicitis’, ‘hepatitis infectious 
mononucleosis’, ‘foot infected corn’ (not an application site), ‘pilonidal cyst’ (vehicle group).

With the update of the 52-week safety data of the vitiligo phase 3 studies, there were no obvious 
differences in occurrence of infections at the SOC level: the occurrence of infections and infestations 
(SOC) was 17.4% in the vehicle group over 24 weeks, 15.4% for the period that these patients 
switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib for 24 weeks, and 29.8% for the patients remaining on ruxolitinib 
for up to 52 weeks. Among the most frequent infections at the PT level, there were no obvious 
between-group differences, with probable exception of ‘influenza’ (Table 45). With the update of safety 
data, ‘Covid-19’ became the most frequently occurring infectious TEAE, with no notable differences 
between groups (3.1% versus 3.2% versus 7.3%) as there is a longer observation period in the 
ruxolitinib 1.5% maintenance group, n/PY were comparable: 7.3 for vehicle and 7.9 for maintenance 
with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID.

In the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population, infections and infestations were nonserious with the exception 
of the following 12 events: four cases of ‘serious pneumonia’; two cases of ‘sepsis’; one case each of 
‘bronchitis’, ‘infective cholecystitis’, ‘chronic tonsillitis’, ‘tooth infection’, and ‘diverticulitis’.

Non-melanoma skin neoplasms 
In the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population, in total 11 participants had a TEAE of nonmelanoma skin 
neoplasms: ‘basal cell carcinoma’ in 6 participants, ‘squamous cell carcinoma’ in 5 participants, and 
‘Bowen's disease’ in 1 participant. In the Phase 2/3 Vitiligo Population, the prevalence of nonmelanoma 
skin neoplasms was 0.5% (4 of 767) in the ruxolitinib cream treatment group and 0.4% (1 of 256) in 
the vehicle cream treatment group; 4/5 participants on ruxolitinib had a NMSC on an application site, 
as had the participant with NMSC in the vehicle group. The occurrence was lower as compared to 
approximately 5% in the general US population (Stern 2010), while the prevalence of basal cell 
carcinoma was estimated to be 1.4% and almost 4 times higher (5.4%) in the oldest age subgroup (≥ 
65 years) in the Netherlands (Flohil et al 2011).  
Malignancies 
An analysis of malignancies in the Phase 3 Vehicle-Controlled Vitiligo Population, Phase 3 safety data 
up to week 52, and the Phase 2/3 Vitiligo Population showed a low incidence of malignancies in the 
vitiligo Phase 3 studies, and no significant differences between groups. In the phase 2/3 safety pool, 
malignancies other than NMSC occurred in 1 participant (0.4%) in the vehicle cream BID group and 10 
participants (1.3%) in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream group. Events identified were: ‘breast cancer’, ‘colon 
adenoma’, ‘ovarian cancer’, ‘haemangioma’, ‘lipoma’, ‘melanocytic naevus’, ‘papillary thyroid cancer’, 
‘pituitary cancer’, and ‘prostate cancer’.  
Arterial and venous thromboembolic events, MACE, and thrombocytosis events 
In the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population, a total of 9 participants (3 with vitiligo, 5 with atopic 
dermatitis, and 1 with psoriasis), all of whom were on a ruxolitinib cream regimen at the time of onset 
of the event, had at least 1 treatment-emergent thromboembolic event, including VTE and MACE: 
‘coronary artery occlusion’, ‘pulmonary embolism (PE)’, and ‘cerebrovascular accident’ in 2 participants 
each and ‘myocardial infarction’, ‘deep venous thrombosis (DVT)’, ‘transient ischemic attack’, and 
‘thrombosis’ in 1 participant each. Plasma ruxolitinib concentrations in 8 of the 9 participants with 
thromboembolic events were substantially lower than the IC50 for JAK2 inhibition in whole blood assays 
at all timepoints prior to the onset of the TEAEs.  
In the updated safety database of the phase2/3 vitiligo studies, no cases of VTE occurred, but two 
thromboembolic TEAEs were found (‘cardiac ventricular thrombosis’ and ‘thrombosis’) with one MACE. 
According to the case descriptions, these participants had other risk factors for the event (multiple risk 
factors for MACE including previous PE and DVT; immobilisation after surgery without anticoagulation).  
In the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of thrombosis (1 event 
in a participant with vitiligo), DVT (1 event in a participant with atopic dermatitis), and PE (2 events in 
2 participants with atopic dermatitis) were 10 per 10,000 PY. These incidence rates are similar to those 
reported in the general population: 4.5 to 11.7 per 10,000 PY for DVT and 2.9 to 7.8 per 10,000 PY for 
PE (Alotaibi et al 2016, Heit 2015) and to those reported for participants with vitiligo (Schneeweiss et 
al 2021). For oral ruxolitinib (Jakavi), no association of arterial and venous thromboembolic events and 
MACE was observed in the randomised periods of the Phase 3 studies in participants with myelofibrosis 
and polycythemia vera. 
Liver function 
Elevations in liver function parameters, including ALT and AST, have been observed with oral 
ruxolitinib treatment (Jakavi SmPC). No participant in any oral ruxolitinib clinical study has met the 
criteria for Hy's law. In the pooled phase 3 Vitiligo data, raised values of liver function tests were 
infrequent in both the ruxolitinib cream and vehicle groups in the vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, with 
increases in ALT occurring in 1.1% of the ruxolitinib cream group, versus 0.4% (n=1) in the vehicle

group (Table 46). Over all indications (‘All ruxolitinib cream population’), there were no signals for 
liver-related investigations, signs or symptoms, as all occurrences of TEAEs were <1%. No TEAEs met 
the criteria for Hy's law. Also, after inclusion of the data of the maintenance phase in vitiligo to the 
vehicle-controlled data, there were no consistent patterns of abnormalities in liver function tests, over 
time.

haemoglobin levels were largely overlapping between the vehicle cream BID treatment group and the 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group (see Figure 32). There were no apparent trends over time 
for mean haemoglobin levels, and observed fluctuations were minor and not clinically relevant. With 
the inclusion of data from the treatment-extension periods of the Phase 3 studies, mean hemoglobin 
concentrations remained similar between participants who were initially randomised to vehicle and 
participants who were initially randomised to the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment group.

Across all treatment groups, no participants had a postbaseline shift to CTCAE Grade 3 in haemoglobin 
concentration values (Table 47). Overall, the proportion of postbaseline shifts in haemoglobin 
concentration CTCAE grade values was small. Three participants in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID 
treatment group had a Grade 1 to Grade 2 postbaseline shift.

At all visits through week 24 in the Phase 3 Vitiligo Vehicle
Controlled Population, the mean platelet 
levels were largely similar between the vehicle cream BID treatment group and the ruxolitinib 1.5% 
cream BID treatment group (see Figure 33). There were outlying mild-moderate increases in platelet 
‑
counts for some participants (n=4), and these were more common for ruxolitinib than for the vehicle 
control (n=1). With the inclusion of data from the treatment-extension periods of the Phase 3 studies, 
mean platelet counts remained similar between participants who were initially randomised to vehicle 
cream and participants who were initially randomised to the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment

At all visits through week 24 in the Phase 3 Vitiligo Vehicle-Controlled Population, mean neutrophil 
counts were similar between the vehicle cream BID treatment group and the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream 
BID treatment group. There were no apparent trends over time for mean neutrophil counts, and 
observed fluctuations were minor and not clinically significant. In the long-term safety data of the 
phase 3 vitiligo population, the occurrence of neutropenia and of erythropenia and thrombocytopenia 
remained low. This picture did not change when considering the long-term follow-up data of the phase 
2/3 pool. 
According to the applicant, overall, the proportion of postbaseline decreases in neutrophil count CTCAE 
grade values was small and similar between the 2 treatment groups (Table 49). The majority of shifts 
were to Grade 1 or 2 and were not clinically relevant: 1 participant each in the vehicle cream BID and 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment groups had a Grade 0 to Grade 3 postbaseline decrease in 
neutrophil count values; the participants had no other abnormal neutrophil values during the study and 
no TEAEs associated with abnormal neutrophil values.

The percentages were calculated using the baseline total as the denominator. 
For each row, the percentages were calculated using the number of participants with given grade at baseline as the 
denominator; worst value on study is the worst grade observed postbaseline for a given participant. 
Across all 3 safety pools, there were no notable differences in the change or percentage change from 
baseline in leukocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, erythrocyte counts and reticulocyte counts, between 
the vehicle cream BID treatment group and the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID treatment groups through 
Week 156.  
Clinical chemistry 
Descriptive statistics for the Phase 3 Vitiligo Vehicle-Controlled Population and treatment extension 
period up to week 52, the Phase 2/3 Vitiligo Population, and the All Ruxolitinib Population showed no 
evidence of treatment-related changes in any chemistry values. In addition, there were no consistent 
patterns of abnormalities in chemistry parameters, including liver and renal function tests, over time. 
Vital signs 
In each of the Phase 3 studies in participants with vitiligo and the dose-ranging Phase 2 study in 
participants with vitiligo, the majority of participants had normal vital signs values at baseline and at 
each visit throughout the double-blind period. There were few alert vital signs, and none were 
associated with TEAEs. Alert vital signs showed most frequently single instances of high diastolic or 
high systolic blood pressure and were higher in ruxolitinib cream groups than in the vehicle control 
group.

Use on areas larger than 10%BSA  
In patients with vitiligo, use is restricted to maximal 10% of BSA, according to the posology reflected 
in SmPC section 4.2. The safety of using ruxolitinib 1.5% cream on larger areas was evaluated in study 
211. 
The safety data of study 211, comparing ruxolitinib 1.5% BID with vehicle with a controlled phase of 
24 weeks, stratified by using ruxolitinib on ≤10% BSA or >10% BSA, showed that also in patients 
using ruxolitinib on 10%-20% BSA, ruxolitinib was well tolerated. In that study, there were no clear 
differences in safety profile between patients using ruxolitinib 1.5% cream on less or more than 10% 
of BSA regarding occurrence of TEAEs (72% versus 66%), SAEs (0% versus 4%), Grade>3 AEs (2.6% 
versus 4%); similar proportions of patients had TEAEs leading to drug interruption (10% versus 12%) 
or discontinuation (2.6% versus 3.3%). However, though based on a small number of patients, all 4 
SAEs occurred in the group of patients on ruxolitinib and a BSA>10%: subdural haematoma by 
external physical influence; Grade 3 seizure; coronary artery occlusion in a participant with history of 
hypertension and hyperlipidaemia; Grade 3 oesophageal achalasia in a participant with history of 
dyspepsia. None of these events were designated as treatment-related by the investigator. Except for 
influenza (4 cases versus 1 case), there were no TEAEs at the PT level that tended to occur more often 
in patients on ruxolitinib treating a BSA>10%, as compared to patients using ruxolitinib <10% BSA. 
Adolescents 
In the ‘phase 3’ vehicle-controlled population, the overall incidence of TEAEs for participants who 
applied ruxolitinib cream was somewhat higher in adolescents (56.4%) compared with participants in 
the 18 to < 65 years and ≥ 65 years subgroups (47.0% and 39.3%, respectively). 
On PT-level, the incidence of both ‘COVID-19’ and ‘headache’ was higher in adolescents (7.3% each) 
than in participants aged 18 to < 65 years (2.5% and 3.6%, respectively), but the instances of 
‘application site acne’ and ‘application site pruritus’ were comparable across groups (ranging from 
5.5% to 5.7%). ‘Nasopharyngitis’ in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream treatment group was also more 
commonly reported in adolescents (14.5%) versus participants aged 18 to < 65 years (3.0%) and ≥ 
65 years (0%). In total there were 13 (24%) instances of ‘application site reactions’ in adolescents on 
ruxolitinib 1.5% BID, versus 65 (18%) in adults between 18-65 years of age. 
In adolescents continuing ruxolitinib for at least 52 weeks as maintenance, the overall occurrence of 
TEAS was quite similar (64% versus 58%) as compared to adults. In adolescents, one participant had 
a SAE and discontinuations due to AEs did not occur. The type and occurrence of the most common 
TEAEs were considered reasonably similar for adolescents and adults, including ‘application site 
reactions’, ‘application site acne’ and ‘pruritis’ (Table 51).

Pregnancy and lactation 
When pregnant rats and rabbits were administered oral ruxolitinib during the period of organogenesis, 
adverse developmental outcomes occurred at doses associated with maternal toxicity (see non-clinical 
assessment). No data are available regarding the presence of ruxolitinib in human milk, the effects on 
the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Nevertheless, ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites 
were present in the milk of lactating rats (see non-clinical assessment). 
Women who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from all clinical studies. Women of childbearing 
potential were required to use effective contraception, and men must have been willing to abide by 
protocol-specified methods throughout the study to avoid fathering a child.  
A total of 9 pregnancies and 4 pregnancies of a partner have been reported across the ruxolitinib 
cream clinical development programme as of the data cutoff dates for the ongoing study. Five 
pregnancies resulted in a term birth and healthy infant. Two participants had TEAEs of spontaneous 
abortion (both assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the investigator), and 1 participant had a 
benign hydatidiform mole (serious TEAE assessed as related to the study drug by the investigator). 
The outcomes of the remaining five pregnancies that occurred during the trial are unknown.  
Liver impairment 
In the pivotal studies, patients were excluded if they had current and/or history of liver disease, 
including known hepatitis B or C, with hepatic or biliary abnormalities. For the posology section in the 
SmPC, the applicant initially proposed to reflect that ‘no studies with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID have 
been performed in hepatically impaired patients. However, due to limited systemic exposure, dosage 
adjustment is not necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.’  
Renal impairment 
In the pivotal studies, patients with severe renal disease (with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or 
renal disease requiring dialysis were excluded. For the posology section in the SmPC, the applicant 
initially proposed to reflect that ‘No studies with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% have been performed in renally 
impaired patients. However, due to limited systemic exposure, dosage adjustment is not necessary in 
patients with renal impairment.’ 
Upon CHMP’s request, the following information was added to SmPC section 4.2 ‘As a precautionary 
measure, ruxolitinib cream should not be used by patients with end stage renal disease, due to lack of 
data regarding the safety.’ 
2.6.8.8.  Immunological events 
Since ruxolitinib is a topical cream, the risk of anti-drug antibodies formation is considered negligible. 
2.6.8.9.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Ruxolitinib is predominantly cleared by CYP3A4 metabolism. Drug-drug interaction potential for oral 
ruxolitinib was evaluated in dedicated clinical pharmacology studies that included coadministration of 
strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or a strong inducer (see Clinical pharmacology section for 
details). The plasma area under the curve of ruxolitinib was approximately doubled with 
coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, while only a modest increase was seen 
with coadministration of erythromycin, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
No drug-drug interaction studies of ruxolitinib cream were conducted. However, the potential for drug-
drug interactions with ruxolitinib following topical applications of ruxolitinib cream is considered lower 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 129/152 
 
 
 
 
than that of ruxolitinib after oral dosing because systemically absorbed ruxolitinib following topical 
administration is not subject to first-pass clearance. The applicant argued that concomitant strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors are expected to have a lesser impact on plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib, while 
concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers are not expected to be of clinical impact since the efficacy of 
ruxolitinib cream is likely driven by the local actions of ruxolitinib in the skin.  
Based on the above, the applicant considered that no adjustment to ruxolitinib cream applications is 
needed when patients with vitiligo are on a concomitant treatment with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer. 
Upon CHMP’s request, the following information was added to SmPC section 4.5: ‘Ruxolitinib has not 
been evaluated in combination with other cutaneous medicinal products; therefore, co-application on 
the same skin areas is not recommended.’ And ‘Other topical medicinal products used to treat other 
conditions on the same skin areas should be applied with a minimum of 2 hours after the application of 
ruxolitinib cream. This is also applicable to the use of sunscreen or emollients’. 
2.6.8.10.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug for participants in 
the pooled phase 3 vitiligo data was low, with discontinuation reported for 2 participants each in the 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID (application site rash, fatigue) and vehicle cream BID treatment groups 
(nausea, headache). All events that led to study drug discontinuation were Grade 1 or 2, and all events 
were reported as having recovered/resolved. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to temporary interruption of study drug for participants in the 
pooled phase 3 vitiligo data was low, with discontinuation reported for a single participant for any PT in 
the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID and vehicle cream BID groups (Table 52). The majority of events that 
led to study drug interruption were Grade 1 or 2 with the exception of Grade 3 hepatitis infectious 
mononucleosis and coronary artery stenosis. All TEAEs leading to study drug interruption were 
reported as having recovered/resolved except for 1 participant with Grade 2 application site acne (not 
recovered/not resolved) and 1 participant with Grade 2 elevated blood creatine phosphokinase 
(recovering/resolving); both participants restarted treatment and were ongoing in the treatment 
extension period at the time of data cutoff.

With the inclusion of the data from the treatment-extension periods of the Phase 3 studies, 1 additional 
participant who was initially randomised to the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID group had a TEAE leading 
to discontinuation of study drug (application site eczema). There were 6 other participants who had 
TEAEs leading to interruption of study drug: application site papules and contact dermatitis were 
reported for 1 participant each of those initially randomised to vehicle cream BID, and application site 
rash, hypersensitivity, acarodermatitis, and photosensitivity reaction were reported for 1 participant 
each of those initially randomised to ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. 
2.6.8.11.  Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing data for ruxolitinib. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety database 
Pool 1 consisted of the data obtained from the Phase 3 studies in vitiligo, where 449 patients were 
exposed to ruxilitonib 1.5% cream for a period of on average 159 days (i.e. 23 weeks, range 1-237 
days), and 224 to placebo-vehicle. Pool 4 consisted of the treatment extension phase of both pivotal 
studies, 325 (72%) of 449 patients originally allocated to ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID had at least 52 
weeks of exposure, and 166 (88%) of 188 patients who switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib at week 24 
had at least 24 to 32 weeks of exposure. The number of patients who were exposed beyond 52 weeks 
also increased, mainly by participants originally included in the phase 2 study. In the pool of phase2/3 
vitiligo trials, there were 546 (71%) of 767 patients exposed more than 52 weeks and of them 76 
(10%) were exposed for at least 104 weeks. Together with the safety data of the studies in diseases 
other than vitiligo, the data set is considered to be sufficiently large to detect relatively common AEs; 
even though the vehicle-controlled period is limited to 24 weeks in vitiligo and 8 weeks in atopic 
dermatitis. 
Pooled data from 2579 participants of other studies than in vitiligo (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, 
alopecia areata) were also used to evaluate adverse events of special interest. Extrapolation to vitiligo 
was not extensively discussed by the applicant, but overall the approach can be supported by the 
CHMP. Nevertheless, the larger BSA areas on inflamed or non-intact skin such as in atopic dermatitis 
trial may provide a more “worse case’” scenario for the systemic effect discussion. However, it is noted 
that the majority of these studies were also of relatively short in duration (24 weeks), and about 20% 
provided long term data (52 weeks).  
It is considered reasonable to extrapolate the safety data of adults to adolescents, as the safety data 
of the vehicle-controlled and maintenance phases of the pivotal studies do not point to essential 
differences between adolescents and adults, nor do the data give rise to safety concerns in adolescents 
other than in adults. The type and occurrence of the most common TEAEs were considered reasonably 
similar for adolescents and adults, including application site reactions, application site acne and -
pruritis. The higher occurrence of nasopharyngitis in exposed adolescents is not considered a concern. 
Plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib are lower than in adults (see Pharmacokinetics section), which is 
supportive for safe use in adolescents.

Target population  
The dose of ruxolitinib cream that was studied in the pivotal studies 306 and 307 was limited to ≤10% 
BSA, as reflected in the posology section of the SmPC section 4.2. According to the applicant, this 
limitation was included for practical reasons/patient convenience, and in line with general guidance on 
the BSA to be treated topically in vitiligo. The safety data of study 211, comparing ruxolitinib 1.5% BID 
with vehicle with a controlled phase of 24 weeks, stratified by using ruxolitinib on ≤10% BSA or >10% 
BSA, showed that in patients using ruxolitinib on 10%-20% BSA, ruxolitinib was well tolerated. In that 
study, there were no clear differences in safety profile between patients using ruxolitinib on less or 
more than 10% of BSA regarding occurrence of TEAEs, SAEs, Grade>3 AEs; similar proportions of 
patients had TEAEs leading to drug interruption or discontinuation. In addition, the results from the 
maximum use study, which was performed in patients with atopic dermatitis, did not lead to 
conclusions that AEs increased with the % BSA treated, although the systemic exposure was higher in 
patients with a higher % BSA treated; ruxolitinib appeared to be well tolerated at topical 
administration.  
Upon CHMP’s request, the applicant also provided a summary of exposure according to baseline total 
BSA in study INCB 184424-211. Overall, 33 participants with more than 10% BSA were treated with 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID at least once over the course of study 211 (104 weeks). Taking into 
account the small number of patients which hampers any robust conclusion on the risk of treating 
more than 10% BSA, and as long-term safety data are currently limited, a warning in the SmPC 
highlighting that Opzelura should be used at the lowest skin area necessary and that the posology 
recommendations should not be exceeded has been included in section 4.4. 
In the vitiligo studies, the exclusion criteria included: previous thrombosis/VTE, liver disease, low (<10 
g/dl) haemoglobin, moderately raised liver function values (AST or ALT ≥ 2 × ULN, alkaline 
phosphatase and/or bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN. Recommendations was provided not to use ruxolitinib 
cream in patients with end-stage renal disease.  
Local toxicity studies 
From the dermal safety studies that were performed in healthy volunteers, ruxolitinib 1.5% cream was 
slightly irritating, but there was no evidence that ruxolitinib 1.5% cream did lead to allergic reactions, 
would induce photosensitisation, or has phototoxic properties. 
Adverse Events 
In the pooled ‘phase 3’ data over 24 weeks, there were more patients with at least one TEAE (48% 
versus 35%), and patients with a treatment-related TEAE (15% versus 7.6%), for ruxolitinib cream 
1.5% BID as compared to vehicle. For both the ruxolitinib cream and vehicle groups, there were few 
severe AEs (2.2% versus 1.8%) or SAEs (1.8% versus 0.4%), and discontinuations or interruptions 
due to AEs were infrequent (0.4% - 1.8%) in both treatment groups.  
In the pooled data of the two vehicle-controlled studies up to week 24, in several SOC domains the 
occurrence of AEs was more frequent in ruxolitinib as compared to vehicle: infections and infestations 
(22% versus 17%); general disorders and administration site conditions (17% versus 6.7%); 
gastrointestinal disorders (5.3% versus 2.7%), investigations (4.7% versus 1.8%). 
When adding the 52-week data including the maintenance period (pool 4), the findings were in line 
with the safety findings from the vehicle-controlled phase. The occurrence of AEs in the ruxolitinib 
continuation group increased as compared to the 24-week period, as expected due to the longer period 
of observation with prolonged treatment. Nevertheless, the pattern and occurrence of AEs was overall 
similar. In the group who switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib the proportion of patients with at least 1 
TEAE was 37%, which became 59% in the patients who remained on ruxolitinib. The numbers of 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 132/152 
 
 
 
 
patients with a SAE were low (1.6% in the switch group and 3.6% in the continuation group) and no 
fatalities occurred. AEs leading to discontinuation of drug or dose interruption were infrequent (2.2% in 
the ruxolitinib continuation group). 
The most common TEAEs (≥1%) that were more frequent in the ruxolitinib group, as compared to 
vehicle, included application site acne (5.8% versus 0.9%) and application site pruritis (5.1% versus 
2.7%), as well as application site erythema or rash and nasopharyngitis (4.2% versus 2.2%). Small 
numerical differences appeared for upper respiratory tract infection (2.9% versus 2.2%), influenza 
(1.3% versus 0.4%), urinary tract infection (1.3% versus 0.4%), pyrexia (1.3% versus 0), and 
headache (3.8% versus 2.7%). Thus, although there was no clear between-group difference for 
individual infection AEs, at the SOC level there seemed to be more occurrence of infections with 
ruxolitinib cream, as compared to vehicle (this is further discussed below). 
With addition of the 52-week data, Covid-19 was the most common TEAE at the PT level, which can be 
valued as coinciding with the epidemic. The occurrences of Covid-19 in the vehicle group added to 
occurrence in the vehicle to ruxolitinib group (observation periods) is not dissimilar from the 
occurrence of Covid-19 in the treatment continuation group. Likewise, the occurrence (IR) in the 
pooled phase2/3 population was 5.4/100 PY in the vehicle group and 7.0 /100 PY in the ruxolitinib 
1.5% cream BID group. Application site AEs (acne, pruritis, dermatitis, rash), nasopharyngitis and 
headache, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis and urinary tract infection remained the most 
common (≥2% in any group) AEs. 
The applicant did propose ‘Application site acne’ to be included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
which is agreed. Many of the application site acne did not resolve over time, treatment was interrupted 
due to application site acne in 1 case, the acne did not resolve, and treatment was resumed.  
With the update of the 52-week data, for the group of patients who switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib 
cream, the occurrence of application site reactions other than application site acne, was not notably 
different as compared to the previous period, when these patients were exposed to vehicle. This is in 
contrast to the findings of the 24-week data of vehicle against ruxolitinib, where it appeared that 
application site reactions accumulated in the ruxolitinib group, most notably application site acne, -
pruritis, -erythema, -rash, and -dermatitis. In study 211, there was no recognisable trend for higher 
occurrence of application site pruritis, -erythema, -rash, and -dermatitis, overdose groups, with the 
exception of application site acne. In the trials in Atopic dermatitis, there was no difference between 
vehicle and exposed groups regarding the occurrence of application site acne, pruritis, -erythema, -
rash, and dermatitis. Overall, there is thus currently insufficient evidence to consider application site 
pruritis, -erythema, -rash, and -dermatitis as ADRs. In addition, systemic exposure of ruxolitinib cream 
1.5% is considered to be low, with a bioavailability of about 10% of oral treatment with a regular 15 
mg dose (see discussion in the Pharmacokinetics section).  
In the 24-week vehicle-controlled phase, there were several AEs that occurred more frequently with 
ruxolitinib cream as compared to vehicle cream, most notably: upper respiratory tract infections and 
urinary tract infections, pyrexia, and increases of liver transaminases. This was unexpected for topical 
treatment with a relatively low systemic exposure. Based on the week 52 safety data from vitiligo and 
atopic dermatitis patients, the incidence of pyrexia, and increases of liver transaminases (notably ALT) 
remained infrequent and no differences suggesting an imbalance over treatment groups were found. 
Moreover, pyrexia did appear to be associated with other underlying events, and not as isolated 
events. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to consider pyrexia and increase in liver transaminases as 
ADR of ruxolitinib cream.  
Given the mode of action of ruxolitinib and given its ability to penetrate the skin as needed to exert its 
intended pharmacological action, it is reassuring that skin infections did not appear as an ADR, in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 133/152 
 
 
 
 
24-week vehicle-controlled phase nor in the 52-week maintenance phase. Infections are further 
discussed in the section below on AESI’s.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the 24-week vehicle-controlled data, the occurrence of SAEs was higher in the ruxolitinib cream 
1.5% BID group (n=8, 1.8%) as compared to the vehicle cream group (n=1, 0.4%). Although the 
occurrence of SAEs in the ruxolitinib group was higher as compared to vehicle, the occurrence of SAEs 
is considered to be low and all SAEs were single events. There were no SAEs that are labelled as ADRs 
of oral ruxolitinib (Jakavi SmPC). In addition, in the data of trials including other indications (‘All 
ruxolitinib cream data’) there was no clear clustering of SAEs. With addition of the 52-week treatment 
extension period, the numbers of patients with a SAE were low (1.6% in the switch group and 3.6% in 
the continuation group). 
No deaths occurred in the vitiligo programme. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
The applicant complied with the recommendation from the 2019 CHMP SA, to consider ADRs of (oral) 
JAK inhibitors as AESI’s, since, based on the knowledge available, the systemic exposure of ruxolitinib 
cream 1.5% BID was deemed not negligeable. The applicant used the pooled data of the vitiligo ‘phase 
3’ trials, the pooled vitiligo ‘phase 2/3 trials’ and the integrated ruxolitinib cream database over the 
diseases studies in the clinical programme, to analyse the occurrence of AESIs. 
The occurrence of cytopenias (erythropenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia TEAEs) was low, 
without a clear difference between ruxolitinib cream and vehicle, and the occurrence did not increase 
with longer exposure. In the long-term safety data of the phase 3 vitiligo population and the pooled 
phase 2/3 population, there was no tendency for a mean change (decrease) in neutrophil count over 
time. The number of shifts from baseline in neutrophil count, platelet count, and haemoglobin 
concentrations, were low and usually Grade 1 or 2 shifts. Overall, there is no evidence to support the 
inclusion of cytopenias, including neutropenia, as ADRs in the SmPC. 
In the pooled 24-week vehicle-controlled data in vitiligo, AEs in the infections and infestations SOC 
were more frequent with ruxolitinib cream as compared to vehicle (22% versus 17%). This could not 
be attributed to local skin infections and single PTs, such as nasopharyngitis and urinary tract 
infections. With the update of the safety data of the vitiligo phase 3 studies however, there were no 
obvious differences in occurrence of infections at the SOC level: the occurrence of infections and 
infestations (SOC) was 17.4% in the vehicle group over 24 weeks, 15.4% for the period that these 
patients switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib for 24 weeks, and 29.8% for the patients remaining on 
ruxolitinib for up to 52 weeks. Also at the PT level, there were no obvious between-group differences, 
except for influenza. With the update of safety data, Covid-19 became the most frequently occurring 
infectious TEAE, with no notable differences between groups, while IRs were comparable: 7.3/100PY 
for vehicle and 7.9/100PY for maintenance with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. Based on the available evidence, 
including the follow-up data in vitiligo and the data in atopic dermatitis, there is insufficient evidence to 
conclude that common infections, notably nasopharyngitis, influenza, urinary tract infections, should 
be considered as ADR for ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. There was a concern about serious/severe 
infections, especially lower respiratory tract infection, even with a low incidence. Indeed, in the Pool 3 
ruxolitinib cream total group, there were 14 serious infections including 9 serious infections in 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. Among these infections, 4 participants had serious pneumonia (3 of Grade 
3 and 1 of Grade 4), and 1 participant had serious bronchitis. Three other patients had Grade ≥ 3 
bronchitis. However, the current data regarding serious and/or severe infections TEAEs and plasma 
ruxolitinib levels did not indicate a link between these events and ruxolitinib cream. Therefore, current

data do not support the need to include a specific warning regarding serious infections in the SmPC 
section 4.4 of ruxolitinib cream.  
In the 24-week vehicle-controlled period of the pooled ‘phase 3’ studies in vitiligo, as well as in the 
pooled data of all other indications (0.3%), and 52-week follow-up data of the pivotal studies, there 
were few cases of herpes simplex which was the most frequently occurring viral skin infection. In 
the 24-week vehicle-controlled period and in the 52-week follow-up period of the pooled ‘phase 3’ 
studies in vitiligo, no participant had developed herpes zoster. In the pooled data of all other 
indications, there were relatively few (n=15, 0.6%) cases of herpes zoster, all except one were grade 
1 or 2 in severity and all events resolved without interruption of the study drug. Currently, there are 
no signals from the performed clinical studies to suspect herpes zoster as an ADR of ruxolitinib cream 
1.5% BID.  
In the ruxolitinib cream population (pool 3), a total of 10 participants had a TEAE of non-melanoma 
skin neoplasms. In the pooled data of the phase2/phase 3 trials, basal cell carcinoma was most 
frequent (n=3) of all malignancies reported. There is no established difference between ruxolitinib 
cream and vehicle. From the available data it does not appear that the frequency of (non-melanoma) 
skin neoplasms was increased in the treated population. JAK inhibitors have immunomodulatory 
properties, and ruxolitinib was positive for inducing chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells with UV 
exposure (see Non-clinical AR). A non-genotoxic carcinogenic effect however was considered unlikely, 
based on non-clinical data. Nevertheless, in the vitiligo patients on ruxolitinib with NMSC, 4/5 patients 
had NMSC at an application site (in AD this was the case in 1 of 5). Furthermore, for NMSC to occur at 
application sites, systemic exposure is not needed. The follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib 
cream was not long enough to discard this risk as NMSC may develop over years and lesions are 
asymptomatic in their early stages (in the Phase 3 vitiligo studies, there were 325 participants treated 
with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID for 52 to 60 weeks). While for oral ruxolitinib NMSC is included in the 
SmPC section 4.4, a causal relation between oral ruxolitinib and NMSC has not been established post-
marketing (Jakavi SmPC). Furthermore, a warning regarding NMSC is included in SmPC section 4.4 of 
several JAKi used in chronic inflammatory disorders. Therefore, based on the lack of long-term follow-
up, and as NMSC may be caused locally, a warning has been included in SmPC section 4.4; this safety 
concern was also included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be followed-up post-
approval with a PASS. 
Whether the risk of VTE and of MACE, can be excluded for the general target population could not be 
established. In the 24-week vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, no cases of VTE occurred, but patients 
were excluded if they had a history of thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 
VTE is also not described as ADR for oral ruxolitinib (Jakavi SmPC), although it cannot be excluded that 
the JAK1,2 inhibitors may cause VTE, as reported for other JAKi used in chronic inflammatory 
disorders, as a class effect. While high doses of oral ruxolitinib rather induces thrombocytopenia, for 
the low dose topical ruxolitinib cream, individual cases of thrombocytosis were observed. In the 
integrated clinical data base, the occurrence of VTE and of MACE was infrequent: a total of 9 
participants (3 with vitiligo, 5 with atopic dermatitis, and 1 with psoriasis), had at least 1 treatment-
emergent thromboembolic AE. In vitiligo this was a pulmonary emboly (PE) in 2 participants and DVT 
in one participant. In the updated safety database of the phase 2/3 vitiligo studies, no cases of VTE 
occurred, but two additional thromboembolic TEAEs were found (cardiac ventricular thrombosis and 
thrombosis). According to the case descriptions, these participants had other risk factors for the event 
(multiple risk factors for MACE including previous PE and DVT; immobilisation after surgery without 
anticoagulation). The available clinical evidence available thus far and the relatively low systemic 
exposure to ruxolitinib upon topical administration (see PK discussion), do not suggest that there is a 
risk for VTE or MACE due to treatment with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. Consequently, the CHMP was 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 135/152 
 
 
 
 
of the view that the current data do not support the need to include a specific warning regarding VTE 
and MACE in the SmPC section 4.4 of ruxolitinib cream. 
Raised values of liver function tests were infrequent in both the ruxolitinib cream and vehicle groups 
in the vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, with increases in ALT occurring in 1.1% of the ruxolitinib cream 
group, versus 0.4% (n=1) in the vehicle group. Transaminase increment are a known effect of JAK-
inhibitors including oral ruxolitinib, but occurrence with topical ruxolitinib was low. When considering 
the safety data of the maintenance phase in vitiligo, there were no strong differences between 
treatment groups in occurrence of ALT increased, nor in the other liver related TEAEs, or levels of 
transaminases over time. The vehicle-controlled data and the maintenance data in Atopic dermatitis do 
also not suggest an imbalance in liver-related TEAEs. 
In Phase 2 and 3 studies, alert vital signs showed most frequently single instances of high diastolic or 
high systolic blood pressure. TEAE ‘Hypertension’ had a higher incidence rate (and a higher study 
size and exposure adjusted IR) reported in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (2.0% in ruxolitinib cream 
total group and 1.7% in ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group, vs 0% in the vehicle control group). In ruxolitinib 
cream Phase 3 studies, TEAE ‘Headache’ were more frequent in ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID group than 
vehicle control group (3.8% vs 2.7%). With updated data of phase 3 studies at 52 weeks, it was 
difficult to conclude on causality between ruxolitinib cream and hypertension, and relationship between 
headache and hypertension events, with so few cases and minor difference between vehicle and 
ruxolitinib groups. As a result, adding these events as ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8 is currently not 
considered needed.  
Adolescents 
The safety data of adolescents with vitiligo was limited in number of subjects (n=72 with n=55 on 
ruxolitinib). In the ‘phase 3’ vehicle-controlled population, the overall incidence of TEAEs for 
participants who applied ruxolitinib cream was somewhat higher in adolescents (56.4%) compared 
with participants in the 18 to < 65 years and ≥ 65 years subgroups (47.0% and 39.3%, respectively). 
However, in the ‘All ruxolitinib cream population’ over all four diseases in the clinical programme, the 
proportion of patients with ≥1 TEAE, ≥Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to study drug interruption or 
discontinuation, was similar or lower in the 195 adolescent patients on ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID, as 
compared to the 1417 adults aged between 18 and 65 on the same regimen as outlined below. To 
further support the safety data in adolescents with vitiligo, the applicant submitted safety data of 
adolescents with atopic dermatitis (AD) in two trials (303 and 304) upon CHMP’s request. Adolescents 
with AD were also included in the maximum use study (103) and in two cohorts of a safety/PK study 
(102). When comparing the safety results of adolescents with adults in AD, there were no safety 
concerns: The occurrence of TEAEs, SAEs, ≥Grade3 AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation or 
interruption of study drug were all lower in adolescents as compared to adults. The most common 
(≥2%) AEs were headache, upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis, without notable 
differences between adolescents and adults exposed to ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. In the maintenance 
period from week 8 to week 52, the occurrence of SAEs, ≥3AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation or 
interruption of study drug remained low. The maximum use study was performed in adolescents 
(n=21) and adults, and did not point to safety concerns and no application site reactions were 
reported. It should however be noted that this a small-sized study. The PK study (102) that was 
performed in adolescents (n=21) neither pointed to safety concerns regarding the similar occurrence of 
TEAS over the dose range, and the absence of SAEs and treatment-related Grade≥3 AEs.  
Overall, based on the safety data available thus far in NSV (including the 52-week data) and AD, the 
CHMP considered that there was no difference in the safety profile of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID between 
adolescents and adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 136/152 
 
 
 
 
However, for some JAK-inhibitors, non-clinical findings pointed to potential adverse effects on bone 
development and growth and the applicant was requested to discuss the risk associated with potential 
effects on bone physiology mediated by ruxolitinib in the adolescents and to also discuss the need for 
further studies to investigate bone safety in adolescents.  
The considered that there is currently no signal that ruxolitinib cream could cause detrimental bone 
effects in adolescents; the risk is considered to be low (see non-clinical section), and this was further 
strengthened by the low systemic exposure. However, it was highlighted that in humans, where the 
growth period is longer, tissue renewal (bone remodelling) becomes important already during growth, 
because the average bone tissue age in a 20-year growth period in humans exceeds the osteocyte-life 
span, and matrix microdamage may trigger the bone renewal process (remodelling). Hence, the effects 
of ruxolitinib cream on human bone development may differ from the effect observed in the rat. 
Furthermore, the lack of understanding of how JAK inhibition affects bone dynamics further 
complicates translation from the non-clinical finding to the clinic. Considering that in vitiligo Phase 3 
studies, only 43 adolescents applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID during at least 52 weeks and that 
these studies were not designed to identify a specific risk in adolescent population (i.e., clinical data on 
growth are not available for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo), the CHMP considered it to be appropriate to 
address the safety issue of ‘impaired bone growth and development if used in paediatric patients < 18 
years’ as missing information. As a result, in addition to routine pharmacovigilance activities (follow-up 
in future PSURs), clinical studies INCB 18424-309 and INCB 18424-308 were added as category 3 
additional pharmacovigilance activities to further characterise this safety concern (see RMP section). 
Special populations 
The sample of elderly patients (>65 years) with vitiligo in the studies was particularly small (n=44 in 
the Phase 3 vitiligo studies), which limits the interpretation of safety data in this group. However, it is 
currently considered that the safety profile of ruxolitinib cream in adults is likely to be similar for the 
elderly.  
There was little information regarding pregnancy outcomes when being treated with ruxolitinib cream. 
Oral use of ruxolitinib (Jakavi) is contraindicated during pregnancy. Since there is limited evidence 
from developmental rat and rabbit studies, but there is a proven developmental risk in the class of JAK 
inhibitors and the data for ruxolitinib point to a very low safety margin as compared to the human 
exposure after dermal application, the CHMP considered that the conclusions from the non-clinical data 
pointed to a relevant risk. Even when systemic exposure to topical ruxolitinib is lower than for topical 
ruxolitinib, considering that the treatment of vitiligo can be postponed until the end of pregnancy, 
ruxolitinib cream was ultimately contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding (see SmPC 
section 4.3).  
It is considered that the systemic exposure to ruxolitinib is low but not negligible (see Pharmacology 
discussion). As a precautionary measure, since exposure may be twice as high or higher in patients 
with end-stage renal disease, in particular if more than 10% BSA would be treated, it was indicated in 
the SmPC section 4.2 that use in patients with end stage renal disease is not recommended due to lack 
of safety data. There were no clear differences in safety profile between patients using ruxolitinib on ≤ 
10% BSA and in patients using ruxolitinib on 10-20% BSA and there was no clear relationship between 
severity of hepatic impairment and the increase in AUC, a dosing advice for patients with hepatic 
impairment was thus not considered necessary. 
Interactions with co-medication 
No drug-drug interaction studies of ruxolitinib cream were conducted. For oral ruxolitinib, it is known 
that the use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors nearly doubled the systemic exposure (AUC) to ruxolitinib. A 
relevant interaction is not deemed excluded for topical ruxolitinib, thus this information was included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 137/152 
 
 
 
 
the SmPC section 4.5. As ruxolitinib has not been evaluated in combination with other cutaneous 
medicinal products; the co-application on the same skin areas is not recommended. SmPC section 4.5 
has been updated accordingly. Further, other topical medicinal products used to treat other conditions 
on the same skin areas should be applied with a minimum of 2 hours after the application of ruxolitinib 
cream. This is also applicable to the use of sunscreen or emollients (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Article 20 referral on JAK inhibitors used in chronic inflammatory disorders 
In line with the above, there were no systemic TEAEs that appeared as ADRs for ruxolitinib cream; the 
only ADR was application site acne. The ocurrence of severe AEs and SAEs were infrequent and was 
not considered to be treatment-related. Consequently, the class effects identified for oral JAK 
inhibitors, and thus potentially applicable to ruxolitinib as a substance, are not considered relevant for 
the current application as the systemic exposure, given the different route of administration of 
Opzelura (ruxolitinib cream), is considered to be sufficiently low, not to lead to systemic effects 
including VTE, MACE, malignancy other than NMSC, and serious infections. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of ruxolitinib cream is overall acceptable. The findings when adding the 52-week data 
including the maintenance period (pool 4), were in line with the safety findings from the vehicle-
controlled phase. There were no systemic TEAEs that appeared as ADRs for ruxolitinib cream, the only 
local ADR was application site acne. Given its effects on JAK1/2,  the applicability of the class effects 
considered for approved oral JAK inhibitors to ruxolitinib as a substance was raised. Nevertheless, 
systemic exposure is considered to be sufficiently low, not to lead to systemic effects including VTE, 
MACE, malignancy other than NMSC, and serious infections. Consequently, the CHMP was of the view 
that the current data do not support the need to include specific warnings regarding those class effects 
in the SmPC of ruxolitinib cream. The occurrence of serious/severe AEs and of temporary or permanent 
treatment discontinuations due to AEs was infrequent, in both adults and adolescents. The safety 
profile of ruxolitinib cream in adolescents is supported by the data in adults and the data of 
adolescents in other studies (e.g. in atopic dermatitis). ‘Impaired bone growth and development in 
paediatric patients <18 years’ was included in the RMP as missing information and will be followed-up 
post-approval. Based on the lack of long-term follow-up and because NMSC can be caused locally, a 
warning was included in SmPC section 4.4.; this safety concern will also  be followed up post-approval 
with a PASS (category 3, see RMP). Pregnancy and lactation were included as contra-indication in 
SmPC section 4.3. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during 
treatment and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment; and ruxolitinib cream treatment must be 
discontinued approximately 4 weeks before the beginning of breastfeeding.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the fact that there is no centrally approved medicinal product available for repigmentation in 
non-segmental vitiligo, the PRAC is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Opzelura is 
needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for ruxolitinib. The requirements for submission 
of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the 
CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international 
birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.09.2021. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: in light of the space available on the immediate packaging (including multilingual pack), every 
effort should be made to print the abbreviation ‘EXP’ and ‘Lot’ on the tube label as per legal 
requirements. The Group also pointed out that the inclusion of CMO number may increase the risk of 
confusion between the different digits. However, the QRD Group accepted the omission of MAH’s full 
name and address on the tube label; it is replaced with the MAH’s logo which contains the MAH name.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for ruxolitinib cream is “treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial 
involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age".  
Ruxolitinib phosphate is a potent and selective inhibitor of the JAKs with selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2. 
In vitiligo, JAK-mediated inflammation upregulates CXCL9 and CXCL10 and herewith stimulates CD8+ 
T-cells to produce among others interferon gamma (IFNγ) which impairs pigmentation by melanocytes 
and keratinocytes. Ruxolitinib blocks this JAK-mediated inflammation and as such contributes to re-
pigmentation.   
The clinical presentation of vitiligo typically involves asymptomatic depigmented patches and macules, 
without clinical signs of inflammation. The disease has a predilection for the face and areas around the 
orifices, genitals, and hands. Depigmented areas may show more than one colour shade (trichrome, 
quadrichrome, pentachrome). Non-segmental vitiligo, which has a symmetrical presentation on left 
and right body site, and often occurs in skin area's prone to pressure and friction, is the most common 
form. The clinical course of vitiligo is unpredictable, with stable disease, slow progression over years, 
and occasional flares. 
Vitiligo is a disease with high psychological burden and the ultimate aim of treatment is to reach 
durable re-pigmentation of depigmented patches or macules, with an acceptable appearance from the 
patient’s perspective. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, there are no approved medicinal products for re-pigmentation in vitiligo, and evidence for 
the effectiveness of drug therapies used off-label is limited. Few randomised and controlled clinical 
studies have evaluated potential treatments, and interpretation of these studies is hampered by small 
study sizes as well as heterogeneity of study designs, methodologies, and measures (Eleftheriadou 
et al 2012, Whitten et al 2016). The current management of vitiligo is empirical and based on 
consensus guidelines (American Academy of Dermatology 2020, Gawkrodger et al 2008, Taieb et al 
2013, Vitiligo Research Foundation 2020). In general, first-line treatments consist of topical steroids 
and calcineurin inhibitors, which are most useful for treating limited disease (typically ≤ 10% BSA is 
treated). Second-line treatments consist of phototherapy (NB-UVB and PUVA) and systemic steroid 
treatment, and third-line treatments consist of surgical grafting techniques and depigmenting 
treatments of neighboring healthy skin. Responses to current treatment options vary and have limited 
durability. Treatments can also be time-intensive and burdensome to the patient and may produce 
cosmetically unacceptable results. As a result, there is an unmet need for safe and effective treatment 
options.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The two identical pivotal studies INCB 18424-306 and INCB 18424-307 were randomised, double-
blind, vehicle-controlled, phase 3 studies in adolescents (12 – 17 years) and adults with non-
segmental vitiligo (NSV) up to 10% BSA and at least 0.5% BSA of the face involved. The studies were 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 142/152 
 
 
 
 
completed and provided data up to 52 weeks. In total, 673 participants were randomised (2:1) to 
ruxolitinib 1.5% BID or vehicle BID during the double-blind period of 24 weeks. About 10% of the 
included patients were adolescents.   
The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested in a fixed sequence at 2-sided α = 0.05 level in 
the following order: F-VASI75, F-VASI50, F-VASI90, T-VASI50, VNS and F-BSA, all at week 24. Only if 
the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint (F-VASI75) was rejected, the secondary endpoints were 
subsequently tested.  
The following supportive studies were submitted in support of this application:  
Study NCBI 18424-308, the treatment extension study, was considered supportive for the long-term 
efficacy of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. Study 308 is still ongoing and data from cohort A will remain blinded 
until the study is completed by all participants. Preliminary data from cohort B were provided, including 
participants who had not reached the F-VASI 90 at week 52 in studies INCB 18424-306 or INCB 
18424-307 and continued the use of ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. At time of data cut off all participants in 
cohort B had completed 68 weeks of treatment. 
In addition, in a dose-finding study INCB 18424-211, a total of 157 adult patients with segmental or 
NSV up to 20% BSA were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive ruxolitinib 0.15% QD, 0.5% QD, 1.5% 
QD, 1.5% BID, or vehicle for 24 weeks; 89% completed the study.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was met in both pivotal studies. The proportions of participants reaching at least 
75% repigmentation in the face (F-VASI75) after 24 weeks of treatment were significantly higher in 
those treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID versus vehicle BID (p < 0.0001). In the pooled analysis, the 
estimated F-VASI75 response rate was 30.7% (SE 2.3) in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group versus 9.6% 
(SE 2.2) in the vehicle BID group, with a response rate difference of 21% (p < 0.0001). Pre-planned 
sensitivity analyses yielded comparable results. 
In line with the primary endpoint, each of the five key secondary endpoints were met in both pivotal 
studies, favouring ruxolitinib 1.5% BID over vehicle BID at 24 weeks of treatment. The sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.

1.5% BID versus vehicle BID (p < 0.0001). In the pooled analysis the estimated VNS response 
rate was 22.5% (SE 2.09) in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID group versus 4.2% (SE 1.45) in the 
vehicle BID group, with a response rate difference of 18.3% (SE 2.53). 
• 
The percentage of change from baseline for the F-BSA after 24 weeks of treatment was 
significantly higher in those treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID versus vehicle BID (p-value for 
between-group difference < 0.0001). LSM (SE) for this difference was -20.0 (3.17), with a 
95% confidence interval of -26.22 to -13.77. 
Among the other secondary outcomes (not corrected for multiple testing), physician and patient 
assessments of improvement in vitiligo (F-PhGVA, T-PhGVA, Colour-matching question, F-PaGIC-V, T-
PaGIC-V) were in line with the findings on primary and key secondary endpoints. Overall satisfaction 
and effectiveness scored with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Vitiligo (TSQM) was also 
nominally statistically significantly higher in participants treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID versus those 
treated with vehicle BID. It can be understood that the quality-of-life measures did not show treatment 
effects, as vitiligo does not come with symptoms (pain, itch) like other inflammatory skin conditions. 
The impact of vitiligo rather concerns self-esteem and social impact. 
Adolescents (n = 72) showed equal response rates for the primary and key secondary endpoints (at 24 
weeks) when treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID compared to adults from 18-65 years of age.  
Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome measure showed consistent results across the relevant 
subgroups.  
Maintenance of treatment effect with continued ruxolitinib 1.5% BID exposure was shown for each of 
the primary and key secondary endpoints until week 52 in the pivotal trials. Preliminary data from 
study INCB 18424-308 suggested a maintenance of effect, or further improvement of response up to 
week 68.  
Results from the supportive dose finding study 211 showed superiority of ruxolitinib versus vehicle for 
each of the 4 dosing regimens, with the highest percentages responders in the 1.5% QD and BID 
groups.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Non-white participants were under-represented in the study population. Nevertheless, based on the 
comparable response rates across the different race categories as well as the different (Fitzpatrick) 
skin types, a trend towards between-group differences is not expected. This issue was therefore not 
further pursued by the CHMP. 
Ruxolitinib cream has not been evaluated in combination with other medicinal products used to treat 
vitiligo; the application of ruxolitinib cream and other medicinal products used to treat vitiligo on the 
same skin areas was prohibited in the pivotal clinical studies. Consequently, SmPC section 4.5 was 
revised to highlight that co-application on the same skin areas is not recommended. Furthermore, only 
limited data are available on the use of phototherapy in combination with ruxolitinib cream (study 
211); an additional study is ongoing to examine the impact of concomitant UV treatment. The SmPC 
will then be updated accordingly in a future variation, if appropriate.  
The other (non-key) secondary outcomes generally supported the results obtained with the primary 
and key secondary endpoints, nevertheless there were no significant between-group differences in 
changes in quality of life (DLQI/CDLQI and VitiQol) and anxiety/depression (HADS) possibly due to low 
baseline scores.  
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 144/152 
 
 
 
 
Patients with less than 25% repigmentation by week 52 are unlikely to show clinically meaningful 
improvement with prolonged treatment. Therefore, a 52-week cut-off for non-response in case of non-
segmental vitiligo was added in SmPC section 4.2.  
Additional data on treatment maintenance will come from cohort A from study INCB 18424-308 which 
is currently ongoing. Final results are expected in the first half of 2032 and will be submitted for 
assessment once available.  
Further, data on rebound after treatment withdrawal were derived from post-hoc analyses of data from 
study 211 where none (except one participant with segmental vitiligo) met the definition of rebound 
(F-VASI score during follow-up of at least 25% higher than the F-VASI at baseline). It was therefore 
considered unlikely by the applicant that treatment discontinuation will trigger a rebound effect. Based 
on the available data thus far, this conclusion was endorsed by the CHMP. However, definite data are 
expected from cohort A to be submitted after completion of study 308 in the first half of 2023.   
Adolescents (12 - 18 years) are included in the proposed indication and comprised about 10% (n=72) 
of the total study population. The percentage of adolescents included in the pivotal studies was 
considered to be rather small. Nevertheless, adolescents showed equal response rates for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints (at 24 weeks) when treated with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID compared to adults 
from 18-65 years of age. Given the similar pathophysiological mechanism of vitiligo in adolescents 
compared to adults and comparable systemic ruxolitinib exposure between adolescents and adults, 
together with a similar safety profile; the inclusion of adolescents in the therapeutic indication was 
accepted by the CHMP. 
The sample size of the subgroup adults > 65 years of age was rather small which affected robustness 
of the findings in this sub-population. Consequently, SmPC section 4.2 has been revised upon CHMP’s 
request to inform HCPs that a limited number of patients aged 65 years and above have been enrolled 
in the clinical studies with ruxolitnib cream in vitiligo to determine whether they respond differently 
from younger subjects.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the vehicle-controlled phase, the overall incidences of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs were 
higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5% BID treatment group (48% and 15%, respectively) versus the vehicle 
BID treatment group (35% and 7.6%, respectively). Very few participants had AEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation (0.4%) or temporarily interruption of study drug (1.3%), no participant had a 
TEAE with a fatal outcome. SAEs were infrequent but occurred more in the ruxolitinib group (1.8%) as 
compared to the vehicle group (0.4%). None of the serious TEAEs occurred more than once in any 
treatment group, and no serious TEAE was considered related to the study drug. In adolescents, the 
overall incidence of TEAEs and treatment related TEAEs were also higher in the ruxolitinib 1.5% cream 
BID treatment group (56% and 16%, respectively) versus the vehicle cream BID treatment group 
(35% and 0%, respectively). Overall, the findings when adding the 52-week data including the 
maintenance period in vitiligo, were in line with the safety findings from the vehicle-controlled phase. 
The number of AEs in the ruxolitinib continuation group increased as compared to the 24-week period, 
due to the longer period of observation with prolonged treatment.  
At SOC level, treatment-emergent AEs were most frequently reported as: infections and infestations 
(22% in the ruxolitinib group versus 17% in the vehicle group), general disorders and administration 
site conditions (17% versus 6.7%), gastrointestinal disorders (5.3% versus 2.7%). In the Pool 3 
ruxolitinib cream total group, there were 14 serious infections including 9 serious infections in 
ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID. Among these infections, 4 participants had serious pneumonia (3 of Grade 
3 and 1 of Grade 4), and 1 participant had serious bronchitis. Three other patients had Grade ≥ 3 
Assessment report

Page 145/152 
 
 
 
 
bronchitis. With the update of the 52-week safety data of the vitiligo phase 3 studies, there were no 
obvious differences in occurrence of infections at the SOC level: The occurrence of infections and 
infestations (SOC) was 17.4% in the vehicle group over 24 weeks, 15.4% for the period that these 
patients switched from vehicle to ruxolitinib for 24 weeks, and 29.8% for the patients remaining on 
ruxolitinib for up to 52 weeks. ‘Covid-19’ became the most frequently occurring infectious TEAE, with 
no notable differences between groups (3.1% versus 3.2% versus 7.3%) as there is a longer 
observation period in the ruxolitinib 1.5% maintenance group, n/PY were comparable: 7.3 for vehicle 
and 7.9 for maintenance with ruxolitinib 1.5% BID. 
Common AEs (>1% in either group) that were more frequent in the ruxolitinib group as compared to 
the vehicle group were: application site acne (5.8% versus 0.9%) and application site pruritis (5.1% 
versus 2.7%), nasopharyngitis (4.2% versus 2.2%), and headache (3.8% versus 2.7%). Upper 
respiratory tract infection, application site rash and erythema, influenza, pyrexia, urinary tract 
infection, and increased ALT were numerically more frequent with ruxolitinib as compared to vehicle, at 
low frequency (<2%). Application site acne was included as an ADR in SmPC section 4.8 with a 
frequency ‘common’.  
In the pooled vehicle-controlled vitiligo data, SAEs were more frequent in the ruxolitinib cream group 
as compared to the vehicle group (n=8, 1.8% vs n=1, 0.4%). No serious TEAEs occurred in >1 
participant in any treatment group, and no serious TEAE was considered related to the study drug by 
the investigator.  
In the All Ruxolitinib Cream Population, in total 11 participants had a TEAE of nonmelanoma skin 
neoplasms: ‘basal cell carcinoma’ in 6 participants, ‘squamous cell carcinoma’ in 5 participants, and 
‘Bowen's disease’ in 1 participant. In the Phase 2/3 Vitiligo Population, the prevalence of nonmelanoma 
skin neoplasms was 0.5% (4 of 767) in the ruxolitinib cream treatment group and 0.4% (1 of 256) in 
the vehicle cream treatment group; 4/5 participants on ruxolitinib had a NMSC on an application site, 
as had the participant with NMSC in the vehicle group.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
When ruxolitinib is applied on maximally 10% BSA, systemic exposure of ruxolitinib will be below the 
levels of orally administered ruxolitinib, overlap in plasma levels with oral ruxolitinib at 5 mg BID PO 
will thus only occur during short periods of time. In the situation where ruxolitinib would be applied on 
larger surfaces (i.e., > 10% BSA), plasma levels will be higher and therefore the overlap with oral 
ruxolitinib may become larger. The safety data of study 211 showed that in patients using ruxolitinib 
on 10%-20% BSA, ruxolitinib cream is also well tolerated. Several AEs occurred more frequently with 
ruxolitinib cream as compared to vehicle cream such as upper respiratory tract infections and urinary 
tract infections, pyrexia, and increases of liver transaminases, but robust conclusion on the risk of 
treating more than 10% BSA could not be drawn due to the small sample (n=33). As long-term safety 
data are currently limited, a warning not to exceed the posology instructions (up to a maximum of 
10% of BSA) and a recommendation to use ruxolitinib cream at the lowest skin area necessary were 
included in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Oral JAK inhibitors are associated with myelosuppression (anaemia, neutropenia), infections, NMSC,  
VTE (venous thrombotic events), and MACE, amongst others. Inclusion of specific warnings in the 
SmPC of ruxolitinib cream considering the class effects of JAKis was not considered needed by the 
CHMP because systemic exposure is considered to be low following topical application of ruxolitinib 
cream and overlap with systemic exposure following the administration of a potential oral dose of JAKi 
is considered to be limited. Compared to a 5 mg oral dose, the relative estimated steady state Cmax 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023  
Page 146/152 
 
 
 
 
and AUC after application of the 1.5% cream b.i.d. to about 10% surface is about 15% and 35%, 
respectively. In addition, no systemic effects were seen in the data available thus far.  
Although NMSC was infrequent, most patients (4/5) with NSV and NMSC had NMSC on an application 
site. Furthermore, the follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream was not long enough to 
discard this risk, as NMSC may develop over years and lesions are asymptomatic in their early stages. 
Based on the lack of long-term safety follow-up, a warning was included in SmPC section 4.4. In 
addition, this safety issue will be further followed up post-approval as part of a PASS.  
Oral use of ruxolitinib (Jakavi) is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. Although there is 
limited evidence from developmental rat and rabbit studies, there is a proven developmental risk in the 
class of JAK inhibitors. In addition, considering that the treatment of vitiligo can be postponed until the 
end of pregnancy, ruxolitinib cream was contraindicated during pregnancy and breast feeding (see 
SmPC section 4.3). Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception 
during treatment and for 1 month following the final dose of ruxolitinib.  
Regarding detrimental bone effects observed in non-clinical data, there is currently no signal that 
ruxolitinib cream could cause detrimental bone effects in adolescents because the safety margins in the 
juvenile rat study were 22-38x based on the unbound fraction and detrimental bone effects were only 
found in very young animals and not in adolescents. Nevertheless, considering that in vitiligo Phase 3 
studies, only 43 adolescents applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream BID during at least 52 weeks and that 
these studies were not designed to identify a specific risk in the adolescent population (i.e., clinical 
data on growth are not available for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo), the CHMP considered it appropriate to 
address this safety issue as missing information. As a result, in addition to routine pharmacovigilance 
activities (follow-up in future PSURs), clinical studies INCB 18424-309 and INCB 18424-308 were 
added as category 3 additional pharmacovigilance activities to further characterise this safety concern 
(see RMP section).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Favourable effects 
In both pivotal studies the primary endpoint, F-VASI75 at 24 weeks, was met. This was supported by 
the results of all key secondary outcomes over 24 weeks, including F-VASI90 and T-VASI50 and the 
patient reported Vitiligo Noticeability Scale (VNS) which were corrected for multiplicity. The treatment 
effect of about 20% as reached in facial vitiligo over 24 weeks is considered to be clinically relevant for 
the patients and equates to a number needed to treat (NNT) =5. The relevance of at least 75% 
improvement in facial vitiligo was confirmed by validity studies inside and outside the clinical 
development programme. The treatment effect in the VNS (not noticeable/nearly not noticeable) was 
similar in size to the effect in F-VASI75 and is thus considered of clinical relevance as well.  
At week 24 in the pivotal studies, for 31% of patients on ruxolitinib cream F-VASI75 was reached and 
16% reached F-VASI90, and treatment response further increased up to week 52 (49% and 30% 
respectively). Preliminary data from cohort B of study 308 suggested further improvement up to at 
least week 68. Generally, the response to treatment in vitiligo takes more time than in other 
inflammatory diseases, due to the lag-time in the regeneration following the inflammatory process. The 
data showed that more than half of the patients who did not have a response by 24 weeks (F-VASI or 
T-VASI) may get a response >25% before 52 weeks, however patients who did not have a response by 
52 weeks may have a reduced chance to get a satisfactory response later. In line with the above, a 52-
week cut-off for non-response for the treatment of vitiligo with ruxolitinib cream was considered 
appropriate, as reflected in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Adolescents (12 - 18 years) are included in the indication and comprised about 10% (n=72) of the 
total study population, which is rather limited. Stratified analyses for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints suggested a consistently similar response rate pattern in adolescents compared to adults. 
Thus, although numbers were small, based on the above data and the assumed similar 
pathophysiology as well as an identical negligible systemic exposure level, the inclusion of adolescents 
in the indication is acceptable.  
The proposed indication does not incorporate a treatment-line, in line with the CHMP Scientific Advice 
received. This is accepted as the results indicate there was no relevant heterogeneity in results across 
lines of treatment. Further, there are no available authorised treatments and for none of the 
alternative treatments efficacy has been established in randomised trials in vitiligo.  
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the findings when adding the 52-week data including the maintenance period (pool 4), are in 
line with the safety findings from the vehicle-controlled phase. The overall safety profile of ruxolitinib 
cream is acceptable. 
Based on the available data, treating more than 10% of BSA is unlikely leading to safety concerns. 
However, long term safety data are limited, and therefore a warning not to exceed the posology 
instructions was included in the SmPC section 4.2.  
When ruxolitinib is applied on maximally 10% of the body surface area, plasma concentration of 
ruxolitinib will be far below the levels of orally administered ruxolitinib 5 mg BID PO for most of the 
time. In line with the above, there were no systemic TEAEs that appeared as ADRs for ruxolitinib 
cream; the only ADR is application site acne. Accordingly, the class effects identified for oral JAK 
Assessment report  
EMA/135534/2023 
Page 150/152 
 
 
 
inhibitors as part of the recently concluded Article 20 referral on JAKi used in chronic inflammatory 
disorders, and thus potentially applicable to ruxolitinib as a substance, are not considered relevant for 
the current application as the systemic exposure of ruxolitinib cream is considered to be sufficiently 
low, not to lead to systemic effects including VTE, MACE, malignancy other than NMSC, and serious 
infections. In addition, the occurrence of severe AEs and SAEs was infrequent and did not appear to be 
treatment related; and the occurrence of temporary or permanent treatment discontinuations due to 
AEs was infrequent, in both adults and adolescents.  
The acceptability of the safety profile of ruxolitinib cream to treat NSV in adolescents was further 
supported by the long-term data in adults and by the data from adolescents treated in studies on 
atopic dermatitis. Although detrimental bone effects were seen in a single short-term study in juvenile 
rats (equivalence to 2 years of age in humans), these effects were not reproduced in the pivotal 
repeat-dose toxicity in rats and other species of adolescent age. Due to the safety margins, the 
occurrence of detrimental bone effects in the paediatric population is unlikely. Nevertheless, the 
completion of the studies in adolescents (308) and children (309) are awaited and will be submitted 
once available, the applicant will also follow this issue further in future PSURs.  
Based on the lack of long-term follow-up and because data showed that 4 out of the 5 NMCS’s 
occurred at areas at which ruxolitinib was applied locally, a warning was included in SmPC section 4.4; 
this safety concern will also be followed up post-approval as part of PASS. Because there is limited 
evidence from developmental rat and rabbit studies, but there is a proven developmental risk in the 
class of JAK inhibitors and considering that the treatment of vitiligo can be postponed until the end of 
pregnancy, ruxolitinib cream is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There is an unmet medical need for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo as there are currently no 
authorised treatments available with established efficacy and safety for this condition. 
The short-term 24 weeks treatment data, the long-term data up to week 52 and beyond, supported by 
preliminary data from study 308 and safety data of studies performed in atopic dermatitis, showed a 
clinically relevant and statistically significant response for ruxolitinib 1.5% cream and an acceptable 
safety profile for adults and adolescents.  
Contraindications for pregnancy and breast-feeding has been implemented in the product information. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Opzelura is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Opzelura is favourable in the following indication:

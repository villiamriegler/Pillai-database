be read in the context of all this  information including  the assessment report of 
the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Abseamed®/ Binocrit®/ Epoetin alfa Hexal®’s RMP.
The medicine and what it is used for
Abseamed®/  Binocrit®/  Epoetin  alfa  Hexal®  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
symptomatic anemia: (see SmPCs for the full indication):
 Associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and in children aged 1 
to 18 years old. 
 Adults  receiving  chemotherapy  for  solid  tumors,  malignant  lymphoma  or 
multiple  myeloma  and  at  risk  of  transfusion  as  assessed  by  the  patient's 
general status (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the start 
of chemotherapy) for the treatment of anemia and reduction of transfusion 
requirements.
 Adults in a predonation program to increase the yield of autologous blood.


In  non-iron  deficient  adults  prior  to  major  elective  orthopedic  surgery, 
having  a  high  perceived  risk  for  transfusion  complications  to  reduce 
exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions.
In  adults  with  low- or  intermediate-1-risk  primary  myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) who have low serum erythropoietin (<200 mU/mL).
It contains epoetin alfa as the active substance and it is administered either by the 
subcutaneous (s.c.) or by the intravenous (i.v.) route of administration.

Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks
Important  risks  of  Abseamed®/  Binocrit®/  Epoetin  alfa  Hexal®  together  with 
measures to minimize such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about 
Abseamed®/ Binocrit®/ Epoetin alfa Hexal®’s risks, are outlined below.
 Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of Abseamed®/ Binocrit®/ Epoetin alfa Hexal®, these measures are 
supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization  measures mentioned  under 
relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analyzed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Abseamed®/ Binocrit®/ 
Epoetin  alfa  Hexal®  is  not  yet  available,  it  is  listed  under  ‘missing  information’ 
below
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Abseamed®/ Binocrit®/ Epoetin alfa Hexal® are risks that need 
special risk management activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so 
that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient  proof  of  a link  with  the  use  of  Abseamed®/  Binocrit®/  Epoetin  alfa 
Hexal®. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal  product that  is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Patients with neutralizing anti-epoetin antibodies 
develop resistance to erythropoietin leading to severe 
anemia with a deep decrease in hemoglobin and in 
circulating reticulocytes. So far, treatment of this 
condition remains fully investigative and includes 
immunosuppressive therapy, leading to recovery of 
some of these patients (Macdougall et al 2015)
Pre-existing non-neutralizing anti-epoetin antibodies 
were found to be present in 6% of subjects from 
oncological, nephrological and congestive heart failure 
clinical trials (Barger et al 2012). However, a correlation 
between such baseline non-neutralizing antibodies and 
PRCA could not been shown (Shin et al 2012). Positive 
non-neutralizing anti-Epo antibodies at baseline do not 
represent a contraindication to epoetin alfa treatment.
Patients with a high tumor burden or with a high 
number (≥25 × 109/L) of circulating malignant cells 
such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of 
especially severe cytokine release syndrome, should 
only be treated with extreme caution [relevant for 
marketing authorizations with indication CLL].
Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or 
those with pulmonary tumor infiltration may be at 
greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with 
increased caution.
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC Sections 4.3, 4.4 where recommendations for 
monitoring hemoglobin and bone marrow examination 
should be consider for the diagnosis of PRCA are given,

pharmacovigilance 
activities
An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events 
(thromboses and embolism) has been observed in 
patients receiving ESAs, for patients with CKD, 
thrombotic events (incidence rate ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 
1.08 – 1.44), and dialysis vascular access thrombosis 
(incidence rate ratio 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07 – 1.29) 
increased (Koulouridis et al 2013).
In cancer patients the receipt of ESA increased the risk 
for thrombotic events (odds ratio 1.56) (Khorana 
2013).
Obese patients, patients with cancer and patients with a 
history of thrombotic vascular events are at increased 
risk. Shunt thromboses have occurred in hemodialysis
patients, especially in those who have a tendency to 
hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit 
complications (e.g. stenoses, aneurysms etc.). Patients 
with major surgery are at increased risk, especially in 
those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
Routine risk minimization measures:
SmPC Sections 4.3, 4.4 
where recommendations for monitoring hemoglobin in 
patients receiving epoetin alfa and the administration of 
antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients scheduled for 
major elective orthopedic surgery are given , and 
Sections 4.8 and 5.1.

Table 4
Important identified risk: Hypertension / hypertensive 
crisis
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
There is compelling evidence that treatment by ESA 
generate hypertension (Krapf and Hulter 2009), and some 
authors have shown that hypertension of sufficient 
severity to require hospital admission occurred in over 
10% of Epo-treated patients, and at a rate nearly three 
times that of placebo. The finding of a fivefold elevation 
of hypertensive encephalopathy is even more 
noteworthy. The report of Abraham et al is unique in 
that it analyzed a subset with no exposure to BP 
medication and found that Epo-treated subjects had 
large and significant increases in BP relative to subjects 
on placebo (DBP + 6 and SBP + 13 mmHg, net of 
placebo, both P < 0.05). These data are likely the best 
index of Epo side effects on BP in any population 
reported to date. There is an apparent tendency for the 
magnitude of the BP effect of Epo to be greater in 
patients receiving hemodialysis than in those who are 
predialysis or receiving peritoneal dialysis.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Patients with a history of hypertension might be at a 
higher risk to develop hypertensive complications 
(Brunkhorst et al 1991).

Increased risk of death in trials in case the hemoglobin 
target level was at least 12g/dL (7.5 mmol/L).
Venous and arterial thrombosis listed for epoetin may 
lead to a fatal outcome.
Shortened overall survival and increased deaths 
attributed to disease progression at 4 months in 
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving 
chemotherapy when administered to achieve a 
hemoglobin concentration range of 12 to 14 g/dL (7.5 
to 8.7 mmol/L)
Increased risk of death when administered to achieve a 
hemoglobin concentration level of 12 g/dL (7.5 mmol/L) 
in patients with active malignant disease receiving 
neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
Routine risk minimization measures:

Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient is a plausible 
mechanism.  Incidence appears slightly higher in 
patients with cancer, however a smaller sample size 
than 2 other groups, severity appears mostly mild in all 
groups, and recovery is reported in most patients; 
however rare fatal cases are reported in the larger 
groups, i.e. patients with CKD.
Patients with known hypersensitivity to epoetin are at 
increased risk. Otherwise, no risk groups or risk factors 
are known.

Mechanism is unknown.  Common in patients with CKD 
(Kovesdy 2014); Isolated cases have been reported so 
far (SmPC Binocrit/Abseamed/Epoetin alfa HEXAL, 
2018). Symptoms are mostly unspecific. However 
severe hyperkalemia can induce potential fatal cardiac 
arrhythmia.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Patients with CKD are at increased risk due to the 
effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium 
homeostasis.

Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the 
surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth 
factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate 
the growth of tumours. Conflicting reports in the 
literature, based on in vitro findings from human 
tumour samples, suggest erythropoietins may play a 
role as tumour proliferators. This is of uncertain 
significance in the clinical situation

Important potential risk: Congestive heart failure (CHF)
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
The CHOIR study (Singh et al 2006) showed increased 
risk of Congestive Heart Failure in subjects included in 
the high target hemoglobin group (13.5 g/dL vs. 11.3 
g/dL).
Most important conditions/diseases which lead to CHF 
are: myocardial infarction and hypertension (Mann and 
Chakinala 2012). In the context of anemia, low 
hemoglobin as well as normalized hemoglobin may both 
trigger worsening in patients with pre-existing 
condition, through low myocardial oxygen perfusion or 
hyperviscosity respectively. In addition, hypertension 
worsening/new onset under epoetin may also trigger 
CHF.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant MYLAN S.A.S. submitted on 23 December 2014 an application for Marketing Authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Atazanavir Mylan, through the centralised procedure under Article 
3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004– ‘Generic of a Centrally authorised product’. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 24 July 2014. 
The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and refers to a reference product for which a Marketing Authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on 
the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Atazanavir Mylan, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 
infected adults and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products. 
Based on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients 
with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥ 4 PI mutations). There are very limited data 
available from children aged 6 to less than 18 years (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
The choice of Atazanavir Mylan in treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and the patient’s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 
5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Generic application (Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC). 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data and a 
bioequivalence study with the reference medicinal product Reyataz instead of non-clinical and clinical unless 
justified otherwise.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
AIDS is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
By damaging immune system, HIV interferes with body's ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. 
HIV is a sexually transmitted infection. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, or from mother 
to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. 
There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the 
disease. These medicinal products have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. But HIV continues 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016 
Page 7/27 
 
  
  
to decimate populations in Africa, Haiti and parts of Asia. HIV is transmitted through direct contact of a 
mucous membrane or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid containing HIV, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid, 
pre-seminal fluid, and breast milk. This transmission can involve anal, vaginal or oral sex, blood transfusion, 
contaminated hypodermic needles, exchange between mother and baby during pregnancy, childbirth, 
breastfeeding or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids. 
Introduction of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) within antiretroviral therapy, in association with nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), started a new era in the battle against HIV and enabled the 
construction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which dramatically decreased mortality in HIV-
infected populations in developed countries. Further and substantial improvements occurred with the addition 
of a low dose of the PI ritonavir to another PI in order to increase plasma levels of the latter (i.e. ‘boosting’ 
strategy, denoted by ‘/r’ following the PI), to reduce inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations and 
increase the overall potency of the regimens) (Focà E et al., 2012). 
The long-term efficacy of ritonavir boosted PI regimens, several toxicity events were related to ritonavir 
and/or to the increased plasma drug concentrations of the PIs given in association These events may occur 
either in the short term or in the long term, and include gastrointestinal disturbances, lipid profile alterations, 
insulin resistance and central body fat accumulation. An alternative booster using molecules such as 
cobicistat did not significantly improve the tolerability profile ) Therefore, we still need to assess whether a 
PI-based option without any boosting is a feasible option in selected conditions, where potency and genetic 
barrier against the emergence of RAMs are not compromised and toxicity tolerability profiles of the regimen 
are optimized.. (Focà E et al., 2012). 
Atazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the virus-specific 
processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions and 
infection of other cells. 
Atazanavir (Reyataz) was the first once-daily PI approved for the treatment of HIV-infected patients and has 
been used in clinical practice since 2003) (Focà E et al., 2012) Atazanavir (ATV) is the newest protease 
inhibitor (PI) approved for use in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Busti AJ et al., 2006) 
Atazanavir is a selective and potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease (Deeks ED et al., 2012). 
Atazanavir is co-administered with low dose ritonavir and indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adult 
and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other antiretroviral products. The 
recommended dose in adults is 300 mg once daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and with food. 
Paediatric patients are dosed based on body weight. 
This application is for a generic form of Atazanavir capsules in strengths of 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg and 
applies for the indication of the reference product. This is an abridged application submitted under Article 
10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC. An abridged application is appropriate since the product in this application is 
essentially similar to the existing product REYATAZ (Atazanavir sulfate) 300 mg capsules form the originator 
of BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB PHARMA EEIG. The active ingredient and the route of administration are the 
same for both products.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The information on atazanavir sulphate is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The chemical name of atazanavir sulphate is (3S,8S,9S,12S)-3,12-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-8-hydroxy-4,11-
dioxo-9-(phenylmethyl)-6-[[4-(2-pyridinyl)phenyl]methyl]-2,5,6,10,13-pentaazatetradecanedioic acid 
dimethyl ester sulphate corresponding to the molecular formula C38H54N6O11S and a relative molecular mass 
of 802.9 g/mol. It has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016 
Page 9/27 
 
  
  
 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The polymorphic form was 
characterised by XRPD and shown to be equivalent to that published in the patent literature. 
The active substance is a white to pale yellow, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder with pH dependent 
aqueous solubility. It is slightly soluble at acidic pH, solubility increasing as pH decreases, but practically 
insoluble at neutral pH. Since atazanavir has low solubility (BCS class II), control of polymorphic form and 
particle size are critical to ensuring a consistent performance in vivo. 
Atazanavir contains four chiral centres. Three originate in amino acid-derived starting materials and the 
fourth is generated under substrate control during the process. Enantiomeric purity of the active substance is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation and diastereomers can be detected by the HPLC method. 
Polymorphism has been observed for atazanavir sulphate with four polymorphic forms having been identified. 
The manufacturing process consistently produces the required form (Form A) which will be routinely tested in 
batches of active substance. 
There is no monograph of atazanavir sulphate in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
One source of active substance is used although five manufacturers are responsible for different steps of its 
production. Atazanavir sulphate is synthesized in a convergent process in nine main steps using well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications. The starting materials were re-defined during the procedure 
at the request of CHMP in order to ensure that critical steps (in particular, those generating mutagens and 
vital to control of stereochemistry) and enough of the synthetic process are included in the dossier, thereby 
ensuring the quality of the active substance throughout its life cycle. As a result of this, additional 
manufacturers were added to the dossier and the QP declaration was updated. Initially, the revised QP 
declaration could not be accepted as the audit reports requested by CHMP were not available, resulting in a 
further major objection. The applicant carried out new audits and after providing the reports, the QP 
declaration was deemed acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. The origin, fate and purge of mutagenic impurities have been described. Elemental 
impurities are controlled by several tests in the active substance specification. 
The active substance is packaged in an anti-static LDPE bag with PP seal which comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. These are stored inside a black PE bag which is placed in a heat-
sealed triple laminated aluminium bag containing a silica gel desiccant, all placed in a HDPE drum. 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016 
Page 10/27 
 
  
  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility in MeOH (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, 
HPLC, sulfate test), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy 
metals (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), palladium content (AAS), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), 
polymorphic form (XRPD) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
Impurities are all limited to below the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A. Limits for mutagenic 
impurities have been set in line with the TTC as described in ICH M7. The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of atazanavir sulphate from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) 
and for up to 3 months under accelerated conditions (40°C/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance; identity; water content; specific optical 
rotation; polymorphic form; related substances; assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and are stability indicating. Under accelerated conditions, one impurity was above the specification 
limit in one batch after 3 months. Total impurities and assay remained within specification. All other tested 
parameters were well within specification at all time-points under both sets of conditions and no significant 
trends were observed. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out in solution and in the solid state. Solid atazanavir sulphate 
degraded when exposed to heat at 105oC. In solution, significant degradation was observed in the presence 
of acid, base and peroxide. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was also performed on one 
batch and the active substance shown not to be photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release hard gelatin capsule containing a white to pale yellow powder. 
The capsules are imprinted with MYLAN and ARxxx where xxx denotes the strength of the capsule in mg. The 
different strength capsules are also distinguishable based on their colour. 
The aim of development was to develop a generic version of the reference product, Reyataz hard capsules, 
with equivalent performance in clinical use. Other requirements were for a robust and scalable manufacturing 
process and suitable stability in the commercial pack. 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016 
Page 11/27 
 
  
  
Atazanavir sulphate is highly permeable but poorly soluble in aqueous media and is thus BCS class II. 
Batches with smaller particle size dissolve faster and the particle size distribution is thus carefully controlled. 
It also has poor flow properties. Although multiple polymorphic forms are known, the commercial form is 
thermodynamically stable. It is also stable when combined with the proposed excipients as demonstrated by 
a series of binary compatibility studies.  
Given the poor flow and solubility properties, a granulation approach was adopted. The excipients chosen for 
the capsule contents are qualitatively the same as in the reference product. The relative amounts of each 
excipient were varied in order to afford the desired dissolution and disintegration characteristics. Comparative 
dissolution studies between the optimised formulation and the reference product were carried out across the 
physiological pH range and in the quality control (QC) medium and the profiles found to be similar. The 
generic and originator product also have similar impurity profiles. 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between 300 mg Reyataz and Atazanavir Mylan capsules. Other strengths 
biowaiver was considered justified as the generic product strengths are dose proportional in terms of the 
capsule contents, manufactured using the same process and manufacturer, and exhibit similar dissolution 
profiles across the physiological pH range and in the QC medium. 
Atazanavir sulphate only fully dissolves in acidic aqueous media and therefore, an acidic medium was chosen 
for the dissolution method. Other parameters such as apparatus and rotation speed were then optimised in 
order to afford a discriminatory method. The discriminatory power was demonstrated by testing batches 
made with coarser grade active substance or excess granulation fluid which was shown to produce slower-
dissolving granules. The granulation process was optimised in order to provide a consistent product with 
appropriate dissolution characteristics and also to allow efficient processing. Different parameters in the 
granulation step and subsequent milling and blending operations were investigated and suitable set-points 
chosen. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The primary packaging is OPA/aluminium/PVC – aluminium blisters or HDPE bottles with polypropylene screw 
caps. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: blending of intra-granular excipients and granulation; 
drying  and  milling  of  granules;  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients;  encapsulation;  packaging.  The 
process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical form.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include tests for 
appearance, identification (UV, TLC), colour identification (colour reaction), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity 
of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  degradation  products  (HPLC)  and 
microbiological  quality  (Ph.  Eur.).  The  specification  for  the  other  strengths  is  identical  other  than  the 
description, colour identification and assay (actual amounts). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of final blend, each sub-divided and filled into 
capsules of each strength, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  three  pilot  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Atazanavir Mylan are identical to and were packed in the 
primary  packaging  as  those  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  water  content, 
degradation  products,  dissolution,  assay  and  microbiological  quality.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are 
stability indicating. No significant trends were observed to any of the measured parameters under long term 
conditions.  Under  accelerated  conditions,  an  increase  in  impurity  content  was  noted,  although  the observed 
levels were still within specification after 6 months. In addition, one batch of 300 mg capsules was exposed 
to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products. 
Atazanavir Mylan is not photosensitive. 
In-use stability studies have been commenced on two batches of 300 mg capsules from early after 
manufacture to simulate use of an HDPE bottle containing 90 tablets throughout its usage period (once daily 
posology). All measured parameters were within specifications after the 90 day period, thus the proposed in-
use shelf life after first opening in the SmPC (section 6.3) is justified. The study will be repeated on batches 
from near the end of shelf life once they become available. A bulk storage study was carried out on both final 
blend and filled capsules (1 batch of each strength) in LDPE bags inside a triple laminated secondary bag 
containing desiccant for up to 90 days. The applicant committed to repeat the study on a second batch of 
each strength. In addition, studies were carried out on capsules in a simulated bulk shipment pack under long 
term (up to 12 months) and accelerated conditions (up to 6 months) in order to support the shipment of 
capsules to a different site for re-packaging. These studies show the capsules to be stable in this packaging 
format and a shelf-life of 12 months in the bulk shipment pack is acceptable.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months stored at less than 25oC as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose used in Atazanivir Mylan is produced from milk from healthy animals in the 
same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared

without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising 
the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
All other excipients are of vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
The applicant should carry out an additional in-use stability study using a batch near the end of its 
shelf-life. 
The applicant should carry out an additional bulk storage study on an additional batch of each capsule 
strength.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Atazanavir (ATV) is an azapeptide human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, indicated for 
co-administration with low dose ritonavir, in the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and paediatric patients 6 
years of age and older in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (Reyataz SPC 2014). 
Protease inhibitors (PIs) prevent the formation of mature virions by blocking the processing of viral Gag-Pol 
proteins in HIV-1 infected cells (Safrin 2012). Gag and Gag-Pol gene products are translated into precursor 
proteins as HIV virions mature. These proteins are post-translationally processed by HIV protease to become 
structural elements of the core of future viral particles. Protease inhibitors prevent the cleavage of the Gag-

Page 14/27 
 
  
  
 
Pol polyprotein resulting in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles. This action effectively 
terminates the propagation of infection. 
In vitro pharmacodynamic studies showed ATV had similar potency for inhibiting the HIV-1 protease 
compared to other PI’s but higher potency in inhibiting the growth of HIV-1 infected cells for most strains and 
cell types tested. ATV maintained effectiveness in 88% of the clinical isolates tested from patients with 
resistance to other PI’s. In most cases, when ATV was combined with other PI’s or reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors an additive effect was seen with no antagonistic anti-HIV activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects. 
Safety pharmacology studies showed no adverse effects on respiratory or central nervous function in rats or 
dogs but in one study in dogs sinus bradycardia and PR/QRS/QT prolongation was observed. In vitro studies 
suggested effects on ion currents (HERG, sodium and calcium) and action potential in Purkinje fibres, but 
only at significantly higher concentrations than are observed in the clinic. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In vitro, ATV had Caco-2 permeability consistent with its bioavailability in humans, but was susceptible to 
secretion via P-glycoproteins and OATP transporters. ATV was moderately protein bound in all species (~86-
93%) bound human α-1 acid glycoprotein (88.7 %) and partitioned into human red blood cells (30%) in 
vitro. Radiolabeled studies in rats showed significant tissue distribution with the highest levels occurring in 
the liver, large intestine and stomach (tissue to plasma ratio > 10) following a single oral dose. Twenty-four 
hours after administration no single tissue contained more than 1% of the dosed radioactivity. Relative 
elimination in faeces and urine was not described. Metabolism of ATV occurs primarily in the liver by the 
action of CYP3A4 resulting in, mono- and di-oxygenated, glucuronidated, N-aklylated and dehydrogenated 
species. 
Three potentially reactive metabolites were identified following incubation of ATV in human liver microsomes, 
two of these were also observed in mouse faeces. 
Significant drug interactions have been observed clinically, most due to competition for CYP3A4 metabolism. 
Concomitant ritonavir is clinically indicated to exploit “boosted” ATV pharmacokinetics due to ritonavir’s 
higher affinity for CYP3A4. Numerous drugs from a variety of drug classes are not recommended for use with 
ATV. Ritonavir boosted ATV is contraindicated with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index; 
including, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered 
midazolam, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine.  
Studies in rat indicated significant alterations in plasma protein binding and pharmacokinetics in models of 
obesity and hyperlipidaemia. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
ATV was well tolerated following a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg in mice with lethality occurring at 800 
mg/kg. Rats tolerated 1600 mg/kg without any overt clinical effects. Repeat dose studies in mice, rats and 
dogs indicated that the liver was a common target organ of toxicity and was dose and duration of treatment-
proportional. No other significant toxicities were noted. In the 6-month rat study, liver toxicity was observed 
at the lowest dose tested, 100 mg/kg. In the 9-month dog study the NOAEL for liver toxicity was 10 mg/kg in 
both males and females. 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016 
Page 15/27 
 
  
  
In assays interrogating adverse effects on bilirubin, lipid or glucose processing, ATV had either no effect or a 
diminished effect compared to other PI’s tested at similar concentrations. 
Genotoxicity tests indicated that ATV was clastogenic in vitro but in vivo tests were negative. ATV was not 
mutagenic in the definitive Ames reverse mutation assay. In vitro ATV caused chromosomal aberrations in 
human lymphocytes. In vivo ATV did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum, or 
unscheduled DNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in 
vitro. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats only female mice showed an increased incidence of 
any neoplasm. The benign hepatocellular adenomas seen in female mice were attributed to single-cell 
necrosis (only seen in female mice) and thought to have no relevance in humans at intended therapeutic 
exposures. 
No significant teratological findings were reported from studies in pregnant rats or rabbits. 
Reduced fertility was observed in rats when both males and females received ATV but did not affect fertility 
when only one mate received drug (1400 mg/kg). No adverse embryonic or foetal effects occurred in rats or 
rabbits at maternally toxic doses up to 1920 or 60 mg/kg, respectively. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Atazanavir Mylan manufactured by Mylan, is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all atazanavir containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Therefore, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. The 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data as well known for atazanavir and thus new non-clinical 
data are not required. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference 
product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing atazanavir sulfate. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period 
crossover design under fed conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the evaluation. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016

Exemption  
The bioequivalence study was performed using the highest strength of 300 mg, claiming that all conditions 
regarding biowaiver as described in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence have been fulfilled,. 
A biowaiver has been requested for the additional strengths of 150 mg and 200 mg. 
Atazanavir is rapidly absorbed after oral administration (Tmax 2.5 h) and demonstrates nonlinear 
pharmacokinetics, resulting in greater than dose-proportional increases in bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) 
over a dose range of 200–800 mg daily. In line with relevant guidelines, the bioequivalence study was 
conducted on the highest dose (300 mg).  
It is considered that the conditions for biowaiver have been fulfilled: 
• 
All the three strengths are manufactured at the same site by the same manufacturer and manufacturing 
• 
• 
• 
process. 
The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same. 
The composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional (except for colouring agents) 
Comparable in vitro dissolution data confirm the adequacy of waiving additional in vivo bioequivalence 
testing. Dissolution profiles were considered similar as supported by f2 value greater than 50. 
Consequently, a biowaiver for the additional strengths is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Clinical studies 
The applicant has submitted one single dose bioequivalence study (Study 14-VIN-255) under fed condition in 
support of this application.

Following overnight fasting, the subjects received a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast (approximately 800 to 
1000 calories) to be finished 30 minutes prior to administration of the drug formulation. A standard meal was 
received at about 4, 8 and 12 hours after dosing, as well. 
A washout period of 8 days was kept between two consecutive dosing periods and was sufficient for complete 
elimination of the administered drug from the body. The terminal elimination half-life of atazanavir sulfate is 
approximately 7 hours. 
After drug administration, a total of 21 venous blood samples were collected at pre-dose, and 0.25, 0.50, 
0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00 and 
24.00 hours post dose. 
The study site was responsible for protocol development, study coordination, clinical and pharmacokinetic 
and statistical analysis, reporting of data and audit of the study in compliance with the protocol and SOPs.

Population studied 
Main inclusion criteria 
Healthy, willing, volunteers of age between 18 and 45 years (both inclusive) were selected on the basis of 
laboratory evaluations during screening, medical history, clinical examination (including vital signs, physical 
examination and systemic examination), Chest X-ray (PA view), ECG recordings, Urine pregnancy test (only 
for female subjects. 
Determination of sample size 
Based on Literature and sponsor’s in-house estimate the maximum intra-subject variability observed among 
primary pharmacokinetic parameters was found to be 34. 
Hence, considering the CV of 34 the following estimates were considered for the computation of sample size: 
T/R ratio = 95-105% 
Intra-Subject C.V (%) ~ 34 % 
Significance Level = 5 % 
Power >= 90% 
Bioequivalence Limits = 80.00-125.00 % 
Based on the above estimate, a sample size of 66 subjects was sufficient to establish bioequivalence between 
the formulations with adequate power. However, considering the drop-outs, a sample size of 72 subjects was 
considered for the study. 
Subject disposition  
72 healthy, adult Asian males (range 18 to 45 years) were enrolled in the study. Weight of the subjects was 
within the normal range (Body Mass Index range 18.5 to 30.0 kg/m2) with a minimum of 45 kg.  
Two subjects (number 08 and 17) did not report to the clinical facility in Period 2. They were hence 
withdrawn from the study, and the subjects were not included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. 70 subjects 
completed both the periods of the study as per protocol. 
Three of the 70 subjects were partly excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis. The applicant has justified 
the exclusion of subjects, and performed a sensitivity analysis to show that the exclusion of subjects did not 
alter the overall conclusion of the bioequivalence study. 
Analytical methods 
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using HPLC/MS/MS over a validated concentration range of 
20.000 to 4000.800 ng/ml for atazanavir. Lopinavir was used as internal standard. 
Out of a total of 2982 plasma samples analysed, 119 samples (4.02 %) were re-analysed due to a gradual 
decrease in IS signal (n=84), quantifiable pre-dose level of atazanavir (n=1) or unacceptable IS response 
(root cause equipment failure identified) (n=34). 
Assessment report  
EMA/503216/2016 
Page 19/27 
 
  
  
The analytical method was adequately validated, including pre-study and within-study validations. 
Incurred samples reanalysis was performed and confirmed reliability of the initial results. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Using the estimated concentration time profile of atazanavir, the following variables were calculated: 
Primary variables: Cmax and AUC0-t 
Secondary variables: AUC0-∞, Tmax, AUC_%Extrap_obs, t1/2 and Kel 
Statistical methods 
Statistical comparison of the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ was based on the ANOVA model, 
and was carried out using SAS® Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). The sequence, treatment, period and 
sequence effects were included in the model as fixed effects, and subject within sequence as a random effect. 
All main effects were tested at the 0.10 level of significance using mean square error as the error term. 
The 90% CIs of the relative mean of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of the test and reference formulation for ln-
transformed data should be within 80.00% to 125.00% for atazanavir to establish bioequivalence.

The clinical report stated that 3 subjects were excluded from the PK analysis. The potential consequences of 
the selective exclusion of patient data were noted and new pharmacokinetic analysis was requested without 
subject 64, but including subjects 24 and 26. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was requested in which all the 
available results were included.  
The applicant provided a scientific rationale and the consequences of including or excluding the subjects # 
24, 26 and 64. It was agreed that the calculation of Cmax (primary variable) and tmax (secondary variable) 
would not be affected by the missing samples at the late time-points.  
The applicant has demonstrated that the 90 % CI for T/R of AUC0-t (primary variable) and AUC0-∞ 
(secondary variable) is within the predefined acceptance criteria (80.00 - 125.00 %) even when subjects # 
24 and 26 were included in the calculations. 
Although, the three subjects were only excluded in the calculation of certain secondary parameters: AUC0-∞, 
AUC_%Extrap_obs, t 1/2 and Kel. The primary parameters Cmax and AUC0-t were always calculated including 
subjects # 24 and 26. Therefore, the new analysis presented is very similar to the original analysis, and the 
only result which is different is the ln AUC0-∞ ratio. 
The comparison between the original and the new analysis in which subjects # 24 and 26 are included and 
subject # 64 is excluded (both periods) is shown in Table 3.

Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis performed including subject # 64, demonstrate that the bioequivalence 
criteria are still met. It is further noted that the questionable (very low) plasma levels observed for subject # 
64 were obtained following administration of the reference product. Therefore, these results should not raise 
concerns over the bioavailability of the test product. 
Safety data 
In conclusion, Atazanavir Sulfate Capsule 300 mg was well tolerated by all subjects. Two subjects (number 
17 and 44) reported adverse event after administration of the reference product. No significant or serious 
adverse event occurred during the conduct of the study.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of atazanavir sulphate capsule formulation. The reference product 
Reyataz co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and 
paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, balanced, randomized single-dose, two-
treatment, two-sequence, two-period crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to 
evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. 
Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were considered adequate. 
The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Atazanavir Sulfate capsule 300 mg of Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with Reyataz 300 mg capsules. The point estimates and their 90% confidence 
intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information.

4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Atazanavir Mylan in co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated for the 
treatment of HIV 1 infected adults and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
RAYVOW is indicated for the acute treatment of the headache phase of migraine attacks, with or 
without aura in adults.

4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
In general, recommended initial dose in adults is 100 mg lasmiditan for acute treatment of migraine 
attacks. If necessary, the dose can be increased to 200 mg for greater efficacy or can be decreased to 
50 mg for greater tolerability. 
If the migraine headache recurs within 24 hours of an initial response after taking 50 mg or 100 mg 
lasmiditan, a second dose of the same strength may be taken. The second dose should not be taken 
within 2 hours of the initial dose. 
No more than 200 mg should be taken in 24 hours.   
If a patient does not respond to the first dose, it is unlikely that a second dose will be of benefit in the 
same attack. 
Lasmiditan may be taken with or without food. 
Elderly (> 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The use of 
lasmiditan has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and therefore is not 
recommended for this population (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lasmiditan in children and adolescents aged 6 to <18 years have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
There is no relevant use of lasmiditan in children below the age of 6 years for the treatment of 
migraine.  
Method of administration  
Oral use.  
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Central nervous system (CNS) effects and driving impairment 
Lasmiditan is associated with CNS adverse reactions. In a simulated driving study in healthy subjects, 
lasmiditan significantly impaired the ability to drive (see section 4.7). Patients should be advised not 
to drive or engage in other activities requiring heightened attention until at least 8 hours after taking 
each dose of lasmiditan, even if they feel well enough to do so. Patients who cannot follow this advice 
should not take lasmiditan.

Serotonin syndrome 
Serotonin syndrome has been reported and may occur with lasmiditan or when administered with other 
serotonergic medicinal products [e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase 
(MAO) inhibitors]. Clinical experience for the use of lasmiditan and triptans in temporal proximity is 
limited. The risks of developing serotonin syndrome may be additive. Serotonin syndrome symptoms 
may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. 
tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular signs (e.g. hyperreflexia, 
incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). These 
reactions can be severe. The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a 
new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medicinal product. If concomitant treatment with other 
serotonergic medicinal products is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is 
advised, particularly during treatment initiation, and with dose increases. Lasmiditan should be 
discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected.  
CNS depressants 
Because of the potential of lasmiditan to cause sedation, as well as other cognitive and/or 
neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, lasmiditan should be used with caution if used in combination with 
alcohol or other CNS depressants. 
Medicinal products misuse or abuse potential 
In a human abuse potential study with recreational drug users, single lasmiditan doses of 100 or 
200 mg were associated with greater drug-liking than placebo. In a separate study, there was no 
evidence of physical withdrawal in healthy subjects following abrupt cessation after 7 days of dosing. 
Patients should be evaluated for risk of drug abuse and observed for signs of lasmiditan misuse or 
abuse. 
Medication overuse headache (MOH) 
Overuse of any type of medicinal products for headaches can make them worse. If this situation is 
experienced or suspected, medical advice should be obtained, and treatment should be discontinued. 
The diagnosis of MOH should be suspected in patients who have frequent or daily headaches despite 
(or because of) the regular use of headache medicinal products. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Heart rate lowering medicinal products 
Lasmiditan has been associated with a lowering of heart rate (HR). Propranolol and lasmiditan 
together decreased HR by a mean maximum of 19.3 beats per minute (bpm), i.e., an additional 
lowering of 5.1 bpm compared to propranolol alone. This should be taken into consideration for 
patients in whom these magnitudes of HR decrease may pose a concern, including patients taking 
medicinal products that lower heart rate. 
Serotonergic medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of lasmiditan and medicinal products (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) that 
increase serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Clinical experience for the use of 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lasmiditan and triptans in temporal proximity is limited. The risks of developing serotonin syndrome 
may be additive. Caution is advised (see section 4.4). 
Potential for lasmiditan to affect other medicinal products 
Daily dosing of lasmiditan did not alter the PK of midazolam, caffeine, or tolbutamide, which are 
substrates of CYP3A, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9, respectively. Coadministration of lasmiditan with 
sumatriptan (MAO-A and OCT1 substrate) or propranolol (CYP2D6 substrate) resulted in no 
clinically meaningful changes in exposure of these medicinal products. Following a single dose of 
lasmiditan, creatinine renal clearance over 24 hours decreased slightly (11 %) compared with placebo, 
without changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 
Lasmiditan is an in vitro inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP). 
In a drug interaction study, lasmiditan increased the systemic exposure of coadministered dabigatran 
(P-gp substrate) by approximately 25%. Therefore, when RAYVOW is administered with P-gp 
substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index (such as digoxin), increases in the systemic exposure 
of the coadministered medication may be clinically meaningful (see section 5.2). In the same study, no 
significant change in rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) PK was observed when it was coadministered 
with lasmiditan. 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect lasmiditan 
No change in lasmiditan PK was observed when coadministered with dabigatran etexilate, 
rosuvastatin, sumatriptan, or propranolol. Based on its metabolism clearance pathways, CYP inhibitors 
or inducers are unlikely to affect lasmiditan exposure and no change in lasmiditan PK was observed 
when coadministered with topiramate (CYP3A4 inducer and CYP2C19 inhibitor). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of lasmiditan in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The effects of lasmiditan on human foetal 
development are not known. RAYVOW is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Lasmiditan and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). There 
are no data on the presence of lasmiditan in human milk, the effects of lasmiditan on the breastfed 
infant, or the effects of lasmiditan on milk production. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
RAYVOW therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. Exposure of the newborn can be minimised by avoiding breast-feeding for 
24 hours after treatment. 
Fertility 
It is unknown whether lasmiditan affects human reproductive potential. Animal studies do not indicate 
any effect on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Lasmiditan has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Driving performance was 
evaluated using a computer-based driving simulation. The primary outcome measure was the 
difference from placebo in the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP), a measure of driving 
performance. Administration of single 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg doses of lasmiditan significantly 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impaired subjects’ ability to drive 90 minutes after dosing. In another study of lasmiditan 100 mg or 
200 mg, driving performance did not reach the threshold for driving impairment at 8 hours or later 
after administration of RAYVOW at either dose. 
Patients should be advised not to engage in activities requiring heightened attention, such as operating 
machinery or driving, for at least 8 hours after taking each dose of lasmiditan, even if they feel well 
enough to do so. Patients who cannot follow this advice should not take lasmiditan (see section 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Heart rate decrease 
In clinical pharmacology studies, lasmiditan was associated with decreases in heart rate of 5 to 10 bpm 
compared to a decrease of 2-5 bpm for placebo. Incidence of bradycardia (< 50 bpm and a decrease 
from baseline ≥ 15 bpm) observed in lasmiditan-treated subjects was 7 % for 50 mg, 3 % for 100 mg, 
4 % for 200 mg, and 1 % for placebo. 
Blood pressure increase 
Single dose administration of lasmiditan may lead to a transient increase in blood pressure. In 
non-elderly healthy volunteers a mean increase from baseline in ambulatory systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure of approximately 2 to 3 mm Hg one hour after administration of 200 mg lasmiditan 
was observed, compared to an increase of about 1 mm Hg for placebo. In healthy volunteers over 
65 years of age, the mean increase from baseline in ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 7 mm Hg 
one hour after administration of 200 mg lasmiditan compared to a mean increase of 4 mm Hg for 
placebo. By 2 hours, there were no increases in mean blood pressure with lasmiditan compared to 
placebo. Clinical data for the use of lasmiditan in patients with ischemic heart disease is limited.  
Hypersensitivity 
Events of hypersensitivity, including angioedema, rash, and photosensitivity reaction, occurred in 
patients treated with lasmiditan. In clinical trials, hypersensitivity was reported in 0.1 % of patients 
treated with lasmiditan compared to no patients in the placebo group; all events were mild to moderate 
in severity and occurred within minutes to a day after dosing with lasmiditan. If a serious or severe 
hypersensitivity reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated and administration of 
lasmiditan should be discontinued. 
Dizziness 
In clinical trials, dizziness was the most common adverse reaction, reported in 19.9 % of patients. It 
was generally mild to moderate in severity (severe dizziness 1.2 %) and self-limiting with a median 
time to onset of 0.7 hours and a median duration of 2 hours. No accidents or injuries were reported in 
patients reporting dizziness. The frequency of patients reporting dizziness, and other common adverse 
events, typically decreases with repeat dosing. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is limited clinical trial experience with lasmiditan overdose. In cases reported as overdose, 
adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses, including dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, 
paraesthesia, and hypoaesthesia but have not been associated with increase in severity or frequency. 
However, because adverse reactions are possible in case of an overdose, patients should be monitored 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment initiated. There 
is no known antidote to lasmiditan overdose. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Analgesics, antimigraine preparations, ATC code: N02CC08  
Mechanism of action 
Lasmiditan is a high affinity, centrally-penetrant, 5-hydroxytriptamine 1F (5-HT1F) receptor agonist. 
The precise mechanism of action is unknown, however, the therapeutic effects of lasmiditan in the 
treatment of migraine presumably involve agonistic effects at the 5-HT1F receptor, a decrease of 
neuropeptide release and an inhibition of pain pathways, including the trigeminal nerve. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In in vitro binding studies, lasmiditan showed a > 440-fold selectivity for the 5-HT1F receptor versus 
the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Lasmiditan does not constrict, ex-vivo human coronary arteries, 
ex-vivo human internal mammary arteries, or ex-vivo human middle meningeal arteries, likely due to 
its low affinity at the vasoconstrictive 5-HT1B receptor. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In a thorough QT study, lasmiditan was associated with a heart rate decrease of 6 bpm when compared 
to placebo, and administration of a supra-therapeutic dose of 400 mg suggested a prolongation of the 
QTc in females. Subgroup analyses suggested gender-related differences, since a more pronounced 
QTc prolongation was observed in the female subset. However, as the maximum recommended dose is 
limited to 200 mg, no clinically relevant effect is expected. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of lasmiditan has been studied in three phase 3, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in adult patients (N = 5910). The studies enrolled patients 
aged 18 and older with 3 - 8 migraine attacks per month, and at least moderately disabling migraine 
(Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score ≥ 11). 
Single attack studies 
The population enrolled in the single attack studies (SAMURAI and SPARTAN) was predominantly 
female (84 %) with a mean age of 42.3 years. Patients had an average of 5.2 migraine attacks per 
month in the 3 months prior to enrolment and a mean MIDAS total score of 31.7. SAMURAI, but not 
SPARTAN, excluded patients with known coronary artery disease, clinically significant arrhythmia, or 
uncontrolled hypertension. 78.3 % of patients had ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factor, including age > 40 
(54.2 %), low HDL-cholesterol (31.1 %), high blood pressure/hypertension (21.3 %), current smoker 
(14.3 %), high total cholesterol (10.9 %), and history of diabetes (5.9 %), in addition to migraine. 
21.7 % of patients were prescribed preventive medicinal products for migraine, and 37 % had taken a 
triptan within 3 months of entering the study. The most bothersome symptom (MBS) was photophobia 
(50.3 %), followed by nausea (22.2 %), and phonophobia (20.6 %). In these studies, a second dose of 
study drug or other medicinal product was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for 
persistent or recurrent migraine. 
The primary and key secondary endpoints in both studies were the proportion of patients free from 
pain, and the proportion of patients free from their MBS, compared to placebo at 2 hours after 
treatment.

Both studies met the primary and key secondary endpoints. All doses of lasmiditan demonstrated 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the percentage of patients achieving 
pain freedom, MBS freedom, and pain relief (defined as a reduction in pain severity from moderate or 
severe at baseline to mild or none or from mild to none) 2 hours after treatment (see Table 2). The 
timing of onset of pain freedom is demonstrated in Figure 1; onset of pain relief followed the same 
pattern as pain freedom at 50 mg and 100 mg, with additional separation from placebo seen at the 
earlier time of 30 mins for the 200 mg dose (17.7 % for 200 mg vs 11.6 % for placebo, p = 0.004 in 
SAMURAI, 18.6 % for 200 mg vs 14.7 % for placebo, p = 0.014 in SPARTAN).

Consistency of effect study 
In a study assessing the consistency of effect, patients were treated with lasmiditan 100 mg, 200 mg, 
or control for 4 migraine attacks (CENTURION). In the control group, patients received a single dose 
of lasmiditan 50 mg to treat either their third or fourth attack and placebo for the remaining attacks. 
The population enrolled was predominantly female (84 %) with a mean age of 41.4 years. Patients had 
an average of 4.9 migraine attacks per month in the 3 months prior to enrolment and a mean MIDAS 
total score of 31.9. The study did not exclude patients with cardiovascular diseases, and 58.5 % of 
patients had ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factor, including age > 40 (52.8 %), high total cholesterol 
(10.8 %), high blood pressure/hypertension (16.9 %), and history of diabetes (3.1 %), in addition to 
migraine. 28.8 % of patients were currently prescribed preventive medicinal products for migraine, 
and 65.0 % had previously taken a triptan. The MBS was photophobia (39.7 %), followed by nausea 
(31.9 %), and phonophobia (19.3 %). 
The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients at 2 hours post dose that were free from pain 
after the first attack, and those that were free from pain in at least 2 out of 3 attacks, compared to 
placebo.  
The study met its primary and all key secondary endpoints. Both doses of 100 mg and 200 mg of 
lasmiditan demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the 
percentage of patients achieving pain freedom, pain relief (a reduction in pain severity from moderate 
or severe at baseline to mild or none or from mild to none), MBS freedom, 2 hours after treatment, and 
sustained pain freedom after 24 hours (see Table 3). The timing of onset of pain freedom is 
demonstrated in Figure 2. Pain relief followed the same pattern as pain freedom at 50 mg and 100 mg, 
and was observed at the earlier time of 30 minutes with the 200 mg dose (22.4 % for 200 mg vs 
14.0 % for placebo, p = 0.001).  
Both doses demonstrated consistency of effect with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in the percentage of patients achieving pain freedom and pain relief in at least 2 out of 
3 attacks (see Table 3).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
RAYVOW in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of migraine headaches 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Following oral administration, lasmiditan is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of 1.8 hours. In 
patients with migraine, the pharmacokinetics of lasmiditan was not different during a migraine attack 
versus during the interictal period. Over the clinical dose range of 50 to 200 mg, the absolute 
bioavailability is predicted to be 50 % to 58 % based on results from the population PK analysis.  
Coadministration of lasmiditan with a high-fat meal increased the mean lasmiditan Cmax and AUC 
values by 22 % and 19 %, respectively, and delayed the median tmax by 1 hour. This difference in 
exposure is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Lasmiditan was administered without regard to 
food in clinical efficacy studies. 
Distribution 
The human plasma protein binding of lasmiditan is approximately 55 % to 60 % and independent of 
concentration between 15 and 500 ng/mL. The estimated mean volume of distribution was 304 L. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Lasmiditan undergoes hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism primarily by non-CYP enzymes, with 
ketone reduction to S-M8 as the major pathway. The following enzymes were not involved in 
metabolism of lasmiditan: MAO-A, MAO-B, flavin monooxygenase 3, CYP450 reductase, xanthine 
oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and aldo-keto reductases. 
Lasmiditan is also oxidized on the piperidine ring to M7. Relative to lasmiditan, the metabolites are 
pharmacologically inactive. Lasmiditan is a substrate of P-gp in vitro. 
Lasmiditan and its major metabolites are in vitro inducers of CYP enzymes. Lasmiditan inhibits 
CYP2D6 in vitro. Lasmiditan and its major metabolite are not inhibitors of MAO-A. Lasmiditan 
inhibits P-gp, BCRP, and OCT1 efflux transporters in vitro. Lasmiditan inhibits OCT2, MATE1, and 
MATE2-K renal transporters in vitro. 
A clinical drug interaction study indicates that lasmiditan is a weak inhibitor of P-gp (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
Lasmiditan was eliminated with a geometric mean t½ value of approximately 5.7 hours. No 
accumulation of lasmiditan was observed with daily dosing. The estimated mean total body clearance 
was 66.2 L/h. Lasmiditan generally exhibits linear PK over the clinical dose range of 50 to 200 mg. 
Lasmiditan is primarily eliminated via metabolism. Renal excretion is a minor route of lasmiditan 
clearance with approximately 3 % of the dose recovered as unchanged lasmiditan in urine. Metabolite 
S-M8 represented approximately 66% of the dose in urine, with the majority of recovery within 
48 hours post-dose. 
Special populations 
Age, gender, race, ethnicity and body weight 
Age, gender, race, ethnicity, and body weight did not have a significant effect on the exposure in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of lasmiditan. In a study, gender had an effect on PK of 
lasmiditan with higher Cmax (~ 20 - 30 %) and AUC (~ 30 %) in women compared to men, irrespective 
whether lasmiditan was administered in fed or fasted conditions. No dose adjustment is necessary 
based on age, gender, race, ethnicity or body weight. 
Renal impairment 
Administration of lasmiditan to subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
demonstrated 18 % greater exposure in AUC(0-∞) and 13 % higher Cmax, compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. This difference in exposure is not expected to be clinically significant. No dose 
adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) 
lasmiditan exposure was 11 % and 35 %, respectively, higher [AUC(0-∞)] than that in subjects with 
normal hepatic function. The Cmax were higher by 19 % and 33 %, respectively, for subjects with mild 
and moderate hepatic impairment. This difference in exposure is not expected to be clinically 
significant. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
The use of lasmiditan has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and therefore is 
not recommended for this population. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Carcinogenicity was assessed in a two-year rat study and a six-month transgenic mouse study. In rats, 
an increase in pituitary tumour-related deaths in male rats was seen. The relevance of these findings in 
terms of human risk is unknown. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in mice. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lasmiditan was not genotoxic based on results from the Ames assay in bacteria, a chromosome 
aberration study in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and micronucleus tests in mice. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity 
In studies with rats, there were no effects on male or female fertility. 
In embryofoetal development studies with rats and rabbits, decreased foetal body weights and skeletal 
variations occurred; in rabbits, there was a slight increase in post-implantation loss (embryofoetal 
mortality), and foetal cardiovascular defects (malformations) occurred at a low incidence. Exposure at 
the no-observed-adverse effect doses of 175 mg/kg/day (rats) and 75 mg/kg/day (rabbits) were 
approximately 37 and 1.5-fold, respectively, higher than in humans at 200 mg. 
In a rat pre- and postnatal study, prolonged gestation and parturition and an increased number of 
stillborn pups and frequency of postnatal death occurred at the highest dose tested of 225 mg/kg/day. 
At this high exposure, a decrease in F1 pup mean body weights observed during the preweaning phase 
in both genders was maintained throughout the F1 maturation phase with no recovery. Exposure at the 
no-observed effect dose of 150 mg/kg/day was estimated to be > 19 fold higher than that in humans at 
200 mg. 
All effects occurred at maternally toxic exposures which exceeded human exposure at a clinical dose 
of 200 mg. 
Studies in animals have shown that lasmiditan and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of 
lactating rats.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What RAYVOW is and what it is used for 
RAYVOW contains the active substance lasmiditan, which is used to treat the headache phase of 
migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.  
RAYVOW helps to reduce or get rid of the pain and other symptoms associated with a migraine 
headache. Pain relief may be felt from as early as 30 minutes after taking RAYVOW.  
2.  What you need to know before you take RAYVOW 
Do not take RAYVOW 
- 
if you are allergic to lasmiditan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Do not take part in activities requiring your full attention, such as driving or operating machinery, 
within 8 hours of taking each dose of RAYVOW, even if you feel well enough to do so, because it can 
affect your ability to drive or operate machinery safely. If you cannot do this, you should not take 
RAYVOW. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking RAYVOW if you:  
- 
are taking medicines that increase the level of serotonin (see ‘Other medicines and RAYVOW’). 
These medicines increase the risk of side effects such as serotonin syndrome (a rare reaction 
which may cause mental changes, such as seeing things that are not there (hallucinations), 
agitation, or coma; fast heartbeat; changes in blood pressure; high body temperature; tight 
muscles; trouble walking; nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea).  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
are taking other medicines or substances that cause sleepiness such as sleeping pills, medicines 
for psychiatric conditions, or alcohol 
have ever been addicted to prescription medicines, alcohol, or other drugs.  
If you repeatedly use any medicines for the treatment of migraine over several days or weeks, this can 
cause long-term daily headaches. Tell your doctor if you experience this as you might need to stop 
treatment for a while.

Other medicines and RAYVOW 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking RAYVOW if you are taking:  
- 
- 
medicines that lower heart rate, such as propranolol 
medicines that increase the level of serotonin (including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic 
antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], or triptans)

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before taking this medicine. It is not known if RAYVOW will harm your unborn baby. 
RAYVOW is not recommended during pregnancy. 
If you are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It is not known if 
lasmiditan passes into your breastmilk. It is recommended to avoid breast-feeding for 24 hours after 
treatment in order to minimise the amount of lasmiditan that is passed onto your baby.   
It is not known whether RAYVOW affects your fertility.   
Driving and using machines 
RAYVOW affects your ability to drive and use machines. Do not take part in activities requiring your 
full attention, such as driving or operating machinery, for at least 8 hours after taking each dose of 
lasmiditan, even if you feel well enough to do so. If you cannot do this, you should not take 
RAYVOW.  
RAYVOW contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say it is essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
3.  How to take RAYVOW 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
- 
- 
The recommended starting dose is 100 mg lasmiditan. Your doctor will decide which dose of 
lasmiditan is appropriate for you.  
If you do not become pain free after the first tablet, do not take a second tablet for the same 
attack as it is unlikely to be effective.

back, you may take a second tablet of the same strength no sooner than 2 hours after the first 
dose.  
You should not take more than 200 mg within 24 hours.  
If your dose of 100 mg does not relieve your migraine or causes side effects, talk to your doctor, 
who may recommend a higher (200 mg) or lower (50 mg) dose.  
Use in children and adolescents and patients with liver impairment 
RAYVOW is not recommended in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age), or in patients 
with severe liver problems.

phase of your migraine attack. You can take the tablet either with or without food. 
If you take more RAYVOW than you should 
If you take more RAYVOW than you should, immediately contact your doctor. You may get some of 
the side effects described in section 4. 
If you forget to take RAYVOW

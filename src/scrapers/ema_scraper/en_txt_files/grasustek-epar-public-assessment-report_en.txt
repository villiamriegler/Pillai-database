The applicant’s clinical development programme comprises 3 studies, 2 studies in healthy volunteers at 
2 different dose levels for evaluation of comparative pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD), and a comparative safety and efficacy study in patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy. 
The clinical trials have been conducted in line with CHMP guidance and recommendations from 
scientific advices. The CHMP acknowledged that the additional PK/PD study at the sub-therapeutic dose 
(2 mg) was not a regulatory requirement but would strengthen the totality of evidence to support 
biosimilarity. Furthermore, it is considered that PK/PD trials are more sensitive than the efficacy trial in 
patients with breast cancer for the purpose of demonstrating comparable efficacy; in addition, this 
immunosuppressed population is not sensitive for the comparison of immunogenicity. Therefore, the 
results of this trial are considered as mainly supportive. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance (AS) of Grasustek is pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim (PEG-GCSF) is a long-acting, 
pegylated form of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF or filgrastim) 
which has a longer half-life compared to its parent molecule, filgrastim.  
The finished product (FP) is presented as a sterile solution for injection in a 1 mL prefilled syringe 
(PFS) containing 0.6 mL of a 10 mg/mL solution (6 mg pegfilgrastim per syringe) as AS for 
subcutaneous injection.  
Other ingredients are D-sorbitol, polysorbate 20, sodium acetate (formed by titrating glacial acetic acid 
with sodium hydroxide) and water for injections (WFI). 
The product is available in a pre-filled syringe (USP Type I glass, compliant to Ph.Eur.3.2.1), with a 
(butyl) rubber stopper and a stainless steel needle with automatic needle guard. The needle has a 
flexible, rigid needle shield. 
Biosimilarity is claimed to NEULASTA. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Pegfilgrastim AS is the N-terminally pegylated form of recombinant human granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor (rh-G-CSF) or filgrastim. Filgrastim protein has two intramolecular disulfide bridges 
between Cys37 - Cys43 and Cys65 - Cys75, which forms 2 small loop structures that maintain the 
biologically active conformation of granulocyte colony stimulating factor. 
Due to expression in E.coli, filgrastim is a non-glycosylated (in contrast to the native hGCSF) protein of 
175 amino acid residues with an additional methionine group attached to the human GCSF amino acid 
sequence. Pegfilgrastim is produced by covalent attachment of one ~21 kDa PEG (polyethylene glycol) 
molecule to the amino terminal methionine residue of the filgrastim protein. The relative molecular 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 10/76 
 
 
 
 
mass of Pegfilgrastim is ~ 40 kDa (18.8 kDa for the protein component and ~ 21 kDa for the PEG 
component). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at USV Private Limited, D-115, TTC Industrial Area, Shirvane, 
Navi Mumbai - 400706 (Maharashtra, India). An appropriate GMP certificate has been provided further 
to a MO raised at D120. 
The manufacturing process of pegfilgrastim AS can be described in two stages: 
i) Manufacturing of filgrastim (stage I): a. Upstream manufacturing process; b. Downstream 
manufacturing process 
ii) Manufacturing of pegfilgrastim AS (stage II): pegylation reaction of filgrastim and downstream 
manufacturing process. 
Stage I: Filgrastim manufacturing process 
The protein moiety of pegfilgrastim is expressed in E.coli starting with thawing of a cell bank vial 
followed by culture expansion and production fermentation.  
The fermentation broth is then harvested and subjected to concentration and clarification, followed by 
homogenisation. The clarified, homogenised broth marks the end of upstream manufacture. 
The downstream purification process of filgrastim involves solubilisation of the concentrated 
homogenate, followed by a refolding step, additional chromatographic and filtration steps. A final 
concentration and diafiltration step is followed by filtration of bulk filgrastim solution into specified 
storage bags that may be stored as an intermediate. Filgrastim lots are tested and released prior to 
use. Multiple batches of filgrastim within the stability period are pooled for the manufacturing of 
pegfilgrastim AS. 
Stage II: Pegfilgrastim AS manufacturing process 
Filgrastim batches are pooled to obtain the required quantity of filgrastim to manufacture a batch of 
pegfilgrastim. The pegylation reaction is performed and the PEGylated GCSF is purified by a series of 
chromatography and filtration steps prior to diafiltration, concentration and final 0.2 µm filtration. 
Pegfilgrastim is collected in specified storage bags and stored until further processing to finished 
product. 
The batch numbering system and batch scale are in place and appropriately defined.  
There is no reprocessing throughout the entire manufacturing process. Information on in-process 
controls is provided (see control of critical steps and intermediates section). 
Control of materials 
All raw materials used in the AS manufacturing process are described and are either compendial grade 
or are tested according to in-house standards. In house specifications for non-compendial raw 
materials are provided. AS is a pegylated form of filgrastim. There was a major objection at D120 and 
mPEG was subsequently reclassified as an intermediate. No human or animal derived materials are 
used in the active substance manufacturing process, nor used in the manufacture of the master cell 
bank (MCB) or working cell bank (WCB).

Filgrastim is expressed in E. coli during the manufacturing process (fermentation).  The construction of 
the final expression vector involved multiple modifications and manipulations. E. coli cells were then 
transformed with the final construct. 
A two tiered cell banking system is used. Both the master and working cell bank were manufactured 
under GMP conditions. The established cell banks are tested and characterized in accordance with ICH 
Q5D. Also end of production cells (EOPCs) have been tested. Cell banks are stored at -80 °C. The cell 
bank system has been adequately described, including information on genetic stability and protocols 
for future WCB preparation. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process characterisation studies and prior knowledge were used to develop operational ranges for 
process parameters and in-process tests. Based on prior risk assessment and the outcome of process 
characterisation studies, the critical process parameters (CPP) were identified besides non-critical key 
process parameters (KPP) and general process parameters (GPP). Appropriate justifications were 
provided for the assigned operational ranges for each parameter. The control strategy developed is 
considered suitable to ensure that a product of acceptable quality will be manufactured and to ensure 
consistency of the downstream process with respect to product- and process-related variants. 
Filgrastim is the critical intermediate (CI) used in the manufacturing process of pegfilgrastim and the 
only stored intermediate. Manufacture is described in the manufacture of AS section. Filgrastim quality 
is appropriately controlled via the specifications, as supported by batch data.   
With regards to the specification limit for host cell proteins (HCP), the applicant has committed to re-
evaluate the HCP specification limit once a specified number of batches of filgrastim CI have been 
analysed using the in-house method (recommendation). Respective stability studies support the 
storage period in specified bags. Information is provided regarding the analytical procedures, method 
validation, specifications and stability of filgrastim. 
Further to the MO raised at D120, mPEG was redefined as an intermediate and consequently more 
detailed information on its specification, control and stability was provided. The manufacturing process 
flow, process description, process controls and the in-process testing of mPEG is described and the 
process has been validated. Batch analysis data support the in-house specifications are provided.  
Information about m-PEG used in pegylation, on its specification, control and stability was provided. 
Sufficient details pertaining to the manufacturing process and its controls are described. Batch analysis 
data support the in-house specifications provided.  
Based on the stability results, an appropriate shelf life in specified storage containers is accepted. 
Finally, an appropriate QP declaration to confirm that the intermediate is manufactured in accordance 
with GMP has been provided. 
Process validation 
The manufacturing processes for filgrastim and pegfilgrastim AS have been validated with the objective 
of producing product with predefined quality attributes while manufacturing within the specified 
operating ranges of process parameters of individual unit operations. A prospective approach was used 
for validation of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim manufacturing processes. 
Process validation ranges were defined based on process characterization studies. The results of FMEA 
were analysed to determine the process parameters that should be studied in process characterization 
experiments. Process characterization studies further contributed to demonstration of process 
robustness and the justification of process control ranges used in the process validation activity. 
Process characterization experiments were performed using scale down models of the manufacturing 
process.

Several batches of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim AS were manufactured under the process validation 
campaign, according to the proposed commercial process and at commercial scale. All raw materials 
used were procured from qualified vendors and were tested and released upon receipt.  
Based on the summary and evaluation of process validation data, it was demonstrated that the 
controls established at each unit operation were sufficient to deliver consistent output within the 
inherent variation of the respective unit operation. Each unit operation delivered consistent 
performance which was within the pre-defined acceptance criteria and yielded product with consistent 
quality attributes.  
Hold time studies were performed for all intermediates intended to be held for a certain processing 
time and the hold times are considered supported. 
Tabulated results of lifetime studies for chromatography resins have been provided on a concurrent 
basis at commercial scale. Membrane reuse cycles were established as well and the claimed reuse 
cycles are adequately supported by data. 
Furthermore, the manufacturing process has also been validated with regards to hold times of media, 
buffers and accessories, membrane reuse, cleaning validation and shipping validation. 
Manufacturing process development 
Since development, the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim manufacturing process has evolved. Designation of 
a process variation or change was defined as a change in scale, or the addition/deletion of, or 
significant change to, a unit operation. The production scales for filgrastim (upstream and 
downstream) and pegfilgrastim AS for intended commercial manufacturing, have been validated.  
Process comparability exercises have been conducted at different process development stages. The 
details of process changes in unit operation are described and considered minor. Comparison of 
relevant quality attributes at applicable unit operations between the scales were conducted and 
demonstrated that the pre- and post-change products are comparable. Accordingly, non-clinical 
material and clinical trial material are comparable to (and thus representative for) the process 
performance qualification (PPQ) and commercial batches. 
Characterisation 
Pegfilgrastim AS was analysed for physicochemical and biological characteristics.  
Primary structure was verified using peptide mapping followed with electrospray ionisation tandem 
mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS), peptide mapping followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC) and western blot. Secondary structure was analysed by circular dichroism 
and peptide mapping to confirm disulphide linkage analysis, and free cysteine confirmation. Tertiary 
structure was verified using fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, pegfilgrastim AS was also 
analysed using differential scanning calorimetry and analytical centrifugation. The characterisation 
studies confirmed that pegfilgrastim AS showed the expected structure. Purity was evaluated by a 
combination of different methods: size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC), RP-HPLC, IEX-HPLC and 
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Overall purity level was very 
high.  
The potency of pegfilgrastim was investigated by the compendial cell proliferation assay for filgrastim 
(in vitro cell line based proliferation assay). In this assay, pegfilgrastim binds to the G-CSF receptor on 
the cell surface and triggers intracellular signalling pathways resulting in dose-dependent cell 
proliferation. Cell proliferation is detected by a tetrazolium-based substrate that is reduced by 
mitochondrial enzymes of viable cells producing a coloured product which is detected photometrically. 
Relative potency is compared to a reference standard. A receptor binding assay by surface plasmon

resonance (SPR-BIAcore) has been employed and demonstrated that the association and dissociation 
of FP with the filgrastim receptor is highly comparable to that of EU-authorized Neulasta.  
For process-related impurities a risk assessment was performed. Small scale spiking studies for 
specified process-related impurities (including host cell proteins (HCP) and residual DNA) were 
performed and demonstrated adequate clearance capability of the manufacturing process.  
Data were provided to demonstrate that process-related impurities are cleared by the manufacturing 
process.  
Analysis of product-related impurities/substances has been performed employing orthogonal 
chromatographic methods (RP-/SEC-/IEC-HPLC). Size-related variants were identified as dimer/di-
pegylated and unpegylated filgrastim ll at low levels. Identification of related substances revealed 
oxidised and deamidated variants at low levels. Deamidated variants were found in pegfilgrastim at low 
levels and multiple potential deamidation sites were identified. Truncated forms, reduced forms and 
positional isomers were not observed. Overall, the characterisation of product-related impurities is 
considered comprehensive and the results are consistent across the orthogonal methods. 
Specification 
Specification 
An active substance specification is provided including test parameters on identity, potency, content, 
purity, impurities, and microbiological safety. The list of parameters is considered comprehensive. The 
specification for active substance stability testing is nearly identical to release testing.  During the 
procedure, a number of specifications for product related substances/ impurities were revised upon 
request.  
Analytical methods 
All methods used for release testing were developed in-house except for the compendial methods 
(description, pH, endotoxin and bioburden). Development summaries along with method comparability 
details, as applicable, are explained in the respective section for each test parameter. 
Method validation reports have been submitted for the non-compendial analytical methods. Validations 
were performed in accordance with ICH Q2(R1). The presented data support the suitability of the 
methods for their intended use. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data were provided (non-clinical batches, clinical batches and an appropriate number of process 
validation batches -all commercial scale) showing that all batches were consistent and complied with 
the specifications. 
Reference materials 
The applicant follows a two-tier system for the reference standard in accordance with ICH Q6B. An 
internal reference standard (IRS) has ben developed, which is the primary standard, and internal 
working standard (IWS), which is the secondary reference standard. The IRS and IWS are 
characterized using orthogonal methods. Qualification of future reference standards will be based on a 
battery of test parameters and their respective acceptance criteria. 
Container closure 
Specified storage bags  are used for storage of the AS. A study regarding potential 
extractables/leachables has been performed using AS and demonstrated that no relevant amounts of 
extractable/leachables are found. The container closure system has been adequately described. 
Assessment report

Stability 
An appropriate shelf-life and storage conditions for pegfilgrastim AS is proposed.  
Stability studies of AS have been performed according to ICH under real time and accelerated 
conditions. The available stability data support the proposed AS shelf life. 
Methods used were stability-indicating. Real time stability data from commercial scale batches filled in 
specified bags (representative of commercial product) are available for clinical batches and an 
appropriate number of process validation batches.  
Photo stability studies have been performed. The studies demonstrated that pegfilgrastim is 
photosensitive.  
Stability studies demonstrate that pegfilgrastim AS remains stable when stored in specified bags 
during the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions and these are therefore approved. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Grasustek pegfilgrastim injection (6 mg/0.6 mL) is supplied as a sterile, clear and colourless 
preservative-free solution for injection (pH 3.8 to 4.3) in a 1 mL USP Type 1 glass (compliant to 
Ph.Eur.3.2.1) pre-filled syringe (PFS). Grasustek final product will be supplied as a single pack 
containing a single pre-filled syringe with needle guard. The qualitative and quantitative composition of 
Grasustek injection (6 mg/0.6 mL) in pre-filled syringe is given in Table 4 below. Grasustek 6 mg/0.6 
mL injection is not formulated with protein overages. It has a defined overfill (0.65 mL target fill 
volume) to ensure an extractable volume of 0.6 mL at the time of administration.  
The quantitative and qualitative composition of Grasustek is the same as the formulation of the 
reference product Neulasta.  
Specifications for the excipients used in the formulation of Grasustek final product conform to the 
current revision of each excipient’s Ph. Eur. monograph. There are no excipients of human or animal 
origin used in formulation of Grasustek final product. Grasustek final product does not contain novel 
excipients. 
The excipients include polysorbate-20 (stabiliser), D- Sorbitol (E420- isotonicity adjuster), sodium 
acetate (formed by titration of glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide- buffering agent) and water for 
injection (solvent vehicle).  
Pharmaceutical development 
Based on the formulation of the reference product Neulasta, formulation robustness studies were 
conducted. Optimal stability was found at pH of 4.0 with pegfilgrastim buffered in 10 mM sodium 
acetate and stabilised with sorbitol.  
The Grasustek manufacturing process history is appropriately described. A comparison of the FP 
manufacturing processes conducted at development stages and the commercial process demonstrates 
that there are no significant differences. Minor changes were needed to account for a higher batch 
scale, different equipment and to adapt the process to the prefilled syringe container closure system. 
Thus, the conclusion that the changes did not impact Grasustek FP quality based on batch release data 
only, is considered supported. The pivotal clinical studies PEGF/USV/PI/001 and PEGF/USV/P3/003 
were conducted with the final formulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 15/76 
 
 
 
Extractables and leachables studies were executed in order to evaluate the compatibility between 
primary packaging and Grasustek FP. Based on the extractables determined within the extraction 
studies, a suitable leachables study was initiated. After 36 months of storage at the recommended 
storage temperature or 6 months under accelerated conditions, no leachable was detected. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Final product manufacture and quality control (QC) testing sites are specified.  Final product 
manufacture and quality control (QC) testing sites are specified.  
Juta Pharma GmbH, Germany is responsible for EU batch release of the final product. A major 
objection was raised at D120 requesting a valid GMP certificate for the FP manufacturing site. A valid 
certificate was supplied during the procedure. Therefore, it has been confirmed that all sites hold 
appropriate GMP authorisations.  
The batch size is specified.  
For pegfilgrastim final product manufacturing, formulation buffer is prepared, aseptically filtered and 
mixed with pegfilgrastim active substance to produce the formulated bulk solution (final product). The 
process description is found to be satisfactory to ensure homogeneity. Using an automatic syringe 
filling machine, the filtered formulated bulk solution is filled into syringes and the syringes are plunger-
stoppered. Filled syringes are subsequently labelled and packaged. The process is adequately 
described. The process parameters and IPCs are indicated. Process hold times are indicated. The 
primary container components are purchased pre-sterilised.  
Process controls 
The pegfilgrastim final product QC strategy includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
• Controls on material attributes, including critical raw materials, starting materials, reagents and 
primary packaging material 
• Controls on design of the manufacturing process 
• In-process manufacturing process controls 
• Controls on the final product 
The process control strategy for FP manufacturing is a risk based approach including FMEA. Upon 
request, the company revised the control strategy and criticality assignments for process parameters 
and in-process tests was based on process characterisation studies, FMEA risk assessment and process 
development knowledge. In addition, appropriate justifications were provided for the assigned 
operational ranges for each parameter. Based on the updated documentation, the control strategy 
developed is considered suitable to ensure that a product of acceptable quality will be manufactured.  
Process validation/verification 
The Grasustek proposed commercial manufacturing process was qualified according to a protocol that 
defined the sampling, analytical testing plan and acceptance criteria for each process step. The 
proposed commercial pegfilgrastim final product manufacturing process was validated during an 
appropriate number of consecutive Grasustek production batches. 
A process performance qualification study was conducted for Grasustek 6 mg/0.6 mL pre-filled 
syringes. Critical process parameters and quality parameters across the manufacturing process were 
evaluated and found within limits. Sampling at different stages of manufacturing was performed as per 
the approved process performance qualification protocol. Equipment qualification and cleaning was 
verified. Adequate filter validation and compatibility studies have been conducted.

Finished product analytical data complied with the specification limit. In general, it can be concluded 
that the manufacturing process consistently produces product that meets its predetermined 
specification and quality characteristics. Shipping conditions for the transport to the EU importation site 
are provided and supported by data. 
A program will be followed which collects on-going process monitoring and validation data for all 
subsequent batches to assure that the proposed manufacturing process continues to consistently 
produce the Grasustek final product. Any significant process changes will be covered via a new process 
performance qualification, with similar approach. 
Product specification 
Apart from some additional general tests (for which Ph. Eur. analytical methods are used), the final 
product specifications are very similar to those of the active substance. Method descriptions and 
validations are described in the AS section.  
The FP specification includes tests on identity, impurities, biological activity, protein concentration, 
excipient and pharmaceutical particulars. An end of shelf-life specification is also provided. Upon 
request, a test for content of a specified excipient has been added to the FP specifications.  The 
specification proposed for this is agreed based on the submitted data although the applicant is 
recommended to review this specification in the light of further manufacturing experience (see 
recommendations).  
Currently, three different analytical methods have been established for FP impurity control- RP-HPLC, 
SEC and cation IEC. No new impurities are introduced during the FP manufacturing process.  
A rationale for the specification acceptance criteria is presented. The justification provided can be 
accepted, including acceptance limits proposed for the impurities and product-related substances of 
Grasustek FP determined by RP-HPLC, SEC and IEC. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis 
Batch data were provided (non-clinical batches, clinical batches and an appropriate number of process 
validation batches -all commercial scale) showing that all batches were consistent and complied with 
the specifications. 
Reference materials 
The reference standards used are the same as for the AS (see reference standards section). 
Container closure 
A 1 mL pre-filled syringe is used as the container closure system for Grasustek FP which is comprised 
of the following components: 
- A sterile, clean glass syringe barrel assembled with a stainless steel needle. The glass barrel is of 
Type I quality according to Ph. Eur. 3.2.1. 
- Rigid Needle-Shield. 
• A grey bromobutyl plunger stopper  
• A needle guard system.

Relevant information on the packaging components has been presented. The components comply with 
relevant European standards.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months for Grasustek finished product batches when stored at 5 ± 3 °C is proposed.  
Stability studies of final product have been performed under real time (5 ± 3 °C) and accelerated (25 
± 2 °C) conditions. Test methods include stability-indicating parameters. 
The proposed shelf-life is supported by the stability studies. Stability studies demonstrate that 
Grasustek final product remains stable up to 36 months when stored at 2-8 °C. 
Real time stability data (according to ICH) are available for non-clinical, clinical batches and a suitable 
number of process validation batches.  . All stability results are compliant with the specifications. 
Accelerated stability studies (25 ± 2 °C) were performed up to 6 months on commercial scale batches.  
Results of the photo stability study show that the finished product is photosensitive. Therefore, the 
product information includes a warning to keep the container in the outer carton in order to protect 
from light. 
Thermal excursion was additionally studied for the FP at different conditions. As described in the 
SmPC, Grasustek may be exposed to room temperature (not above 30°C) for a maximum single period 
of up to 72 hours. Grasustek left at room temperature for more than 72 hours should be discarded. 
The thermal excursion data also support the SmPC statement that accidental exposure to freezing 
temperatures for a single period of less than 24 hours does not adversely affect the stability of 
Grasustek. 
A shelf-life of 36 months for Grasustek when stored at 5 ± 3 °C is approved.  
Adventitious agents 
The manufacture of pegfilgrastim AS does not utilize any raw materials of human or animal origin 
therefore viral and TSE safety is assured. Where applicable, bioburden and/or endotoxin specifications 
for incoming raw materials used in manufacturing have been established. 
In addition to raw material contamination controls, the pegfilgrastim AS manufacturing process 
contains multiple preventive measures against adventitious agent contamination. All equipment is 
cleaned and either sanitized or sterilized, using in-house procedures. Open operations are minimized; 
those that are required are conducted in controlled environments and by personnel wearing protective 
gowns according to environmental requirements. In-process sampling to monitor bioburden and 
endotoxin is conducted throughout the process. Resins used in manufacturing are cleaned and 
sanitized as appropriate.  
Sufficient information has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
Biosimilarity 
The development of the biosimilar product Grasustek is based on comparability to the reference 
product Neulasta derived from the EU market. The quality target product profile (QTPP) of Grasustek is 
based on EU Neulasta. Preclinical and clinical studies were performed in comparison to EU Neulasta. To 
establish biosimilarity of Grasustek to EU Neulasta, a head-to-head analytical similarity study was 
performed. An overview of the biosimilarity analyses is provided in Table 1 below.

Depending on the method, number of batches of Grasustek and EU Neulasta were included in the 
analytical similarity study. Overall, the number of reference and test batches included in the study is 
considered acceptable. Head-to-head analytical similarity studies were performed with test batches 
reflecting all development phases of Grasustek. Analytical methods used for analytical similarity 
studies were those developed at the time of analysis.  
Primary structure analysis confirmed identical amino acid sequence and pegylation site in the test and 
the reference product. Slight differences in molecular mass of pegfilgrastim and reference Neulasta 
was observed. This is attributed to the PEG-aldehyde used for Grasustek. Secondary and tertiary 
structures including the correct presence of disulphide bridges in the test and reference products is 
appropriately analysed using diverse state-of the art analytical methods. Based on the results, 
biosimilarity in terms of higher order structures is demonstrated. 
Aggregates in the test and reference products are investigated using SEC, analytical ultracentrifugation 
(AUC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Within the limitations of the methods used it is confirmed 
that the amount of high molecular weight impurities including dimer co-eluting with dipegylated 
filgrastim impurities, trimer and aggregates is within or even lower than the range of the reference

product. In addition the amount of unpegylated filgrastim seems to be lower in pegfilgrastim than in 
Neulasta. 
RP-HPLC is used to compare the amount of oxidised and deamidated forms, i.e. oxidation at M127 
(“ox-1”) and M138 and deamidation at multiple sites. Overall, RP-HPLC impurities of the test product 
are found within the range of Neulasta or even lower. Although certain specified attributes are higher 
in Grasustek, the total amount of these impurities in Grasustek is still very low and not considered 
clinically relevant. 
Comparative IEC analysis demonstrates the total of IEC impurities in Grasustek to be below the 
reference range of Neulasta. The amount of free PEG aldehyde in Grasustek and EU Neulasta was 
studied and found to be lower in Grasustek than in Neulasta. The impression of an overall higher purity 
in Grasustek in comparison to the reference product Neulasta is also supported by the comparative 
stability data provided.  
Biological activity in terms of cell proliferation and receptor binding was investigated. Comparable 
biological activity has been demonstrated for the test product and EU Neulasta. Upon request, the 
applicant provided the qualification report of the method that was used to analyse receptor binding 
(SPR) in the biosimilarity analysis. The method has been properly qualified.  
Protein concentration results demonstrate high similarity between the candidate biosimilar and 
reference product. Summarising, biosimilarity of Grasustek with the reference product EU Neulasta 
with respect to primary, secondary and higher order structures has been confirmed. Grasustek has 
been demonstrated to have higher purity than Neulasta with respect to oxidized and reduced, 
deamidated and charged variants, dimers, trimers and aggregates as well as free filgrastim and free 
PEG-aldehyde. This is also supported by the comparative stability data provided so far. In addition, 
slight differences between Grasustek and the reference product Neulasta exist with respect to certain 
attributes. Taking these differences into consideration and based on the totality of data, Grasustek 
could be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta from a quality point of view. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Development, characterisation, manufacture and control of pegfilgrastim AS and FP are described with 
a high level of detail. 
During the procedure two major objections (MOs) were raised. One of them concerned the request for 
GMP certificates for the AS and FP manufacturing sites. The other major objection related to a request 
for reclassification of the mPEG, which resulted in the need for: a) confirmation that the intermediate is 
manufactured to appropriate GMP standards and b) more detailed information requirements in the 
dossier to support use of this intermediate in further downstream processing of the AS to produce 
pegfilgrastim. Both MOs were satisfactorily resolved as detailed in the report.  
Biosimilarity of Grasustek with the reference product EU Neulasta has been confirmed with respect to 
primary, secondary and higher order structures. A higher purity than determined for Neulasta has been 
demonstrated for Grasustek. Slight differences between Grasustek and Neulasta exist with respect to 
M127 oxidation and molecular weight. Comparability with respect to biological activity and protein 
content is confirmed. Based on the totality of data, Grasustek can be considered as biosimilar to EU 
Neulasta from a quality point of view. 
The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate and revise the specification limits for a specified excipient 
when data from more batches are available (see recommendations in Annex II).

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Information has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical programme of pegfilgrastim included a series of head-to-head in vitro comparative 
studies including binding studies and cell based assays. A non-clinical comparative study in healthy and 
neutropenic rats, which evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) after a single 
dose of 50, 150, or 450 µg/kg, was conducted to further support the similarity demonstration between 
Grasustek and Neulasta. Finally, a 4-week (total of 5 administrations of 100; 300 and 1000 µg/kg) 
repeat-dose toxicity study including toxicokinetic assessments on days 1 and 29 was performed in CD 
rats and a dedicated local tolerance study was performed in New Zealand White rabbits. 
Safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, single and reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies were not submitted and are not required in this case. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The nonclinical pharmacology in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to assess the biosimilarity of 
Pegfilgrastim (Grasustek) compared to Neulasta, using a variety of batches of both Grasustek and 
Neulasta. Biosimilarity studies included in vitro cell-based models (M/G-NFS-60 cells, a murine

myeloblastic cell line) and receptor binding assays by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR); and in vivo 
PK/PD studies in normal and neutropenic rats. 
Cell proliferation assay 
G-CSF stimulates the proliferation of a murine myeloblastic cell line, designated as NFS-60. This was 
used to determine the relative biological potency of pegfilgrastim and compare it between Grasustek 
and Neulasta in an appropriate number of batches. Figure 1 below shows two concentration-response 
curves taken from two experiments.

Figure 1. Representative dose response curves (PLA) shown for cell proliferation following 
treatment with two batches of Grasustek and EU-authorized Neulasta  
For each batch tested, a relative potency value (relative to the internal standard) was calculated during 
the comparability studies.    
In general, relative potency was around 1 in most cases. 
Receptor binding assay (RBA) by SPR 
The receptor binding affinity (RBA) of pegfilgrastim to the G-CSF receptor was investigated by SPR 
using Biacore 3000 and T200 instruments.  RBA results from all studies show that the association and 
dissociation of Grasustek with the filgrastim receptor is comparable. The results of a representative 
Biacore experiment, measuring binding and dissociation with ascending doses of pegfilgrastim, are 
shown in Figure 2 below.

In vivo study in rats 
The applicant additionally used a rat model with or without pre-treatment with 50 mg/kg of 
cyclophosphamide one day prior to administration of either of Grasustek/Neulasta to compare the 
efficacy of both treatments in terms of absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in normal and neutropenic 
rats after a single s.c. injection of 0 (vehicle control), 50, 150 or 450 µg/kg of Grasustek or Neulasta.  
Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were assessed in all treatment groups from two subsets of 6 animals 
of both neutropenic and non-neutropenic at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 
216 and 240 hours post dose.  In the non-neutropenic group, the ANC gradually increased with the 
highest levels observed at 72 hours post-dose at the dose of 450 μg/kg body weights for both Neulasta 
and Grasustek. In the case of neutropenic animals, peak ANC levels were observed 144 hours post 
dose for the test product and 216 hours post-dose for Neulasta.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A comparative evaluation of the PK profiles of Grasustek and Neulasta was conducted in non-
neutropenic and neutropenic rats administered 0 (vehicle control), 50, 150 or 450 μg/kg as described 
above. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation was done for all treatment groups under 
isoflurane anaesthesia from two subsets of animals having 6 animals each at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 
48, 72, 96,120, 144 and 168 hours post dosing (see figures 5 and 6).

Decreased plasma levels of cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides and as well 
as increased plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase were noted partly starting 
at 100 μg Grasustek or 300 μg Neulasta/kg. No differences were noted 
between the animals treated subcutaneously with 1000 μg Grasustek/kg 
compared to animals treated with 1000 μg Neulasta/kg 
Ophthalmology 
No test or reference item-related influence was noted. 
Macroscopic 
pathology 
Histology 
An enlarged spleen was noted for 7 of 10 male and for 1 of 10 female 
animals treated with 100 μg Grasustek/kg, for 5 of 10 male and for 4 of 10 
female rats treated with 300 μg Grasustek/kg and for 7 of 10 male and for all 
female rats treated with 1000 μg Grasustek/kg. The same finding was also 
noted for 5 of 10 male and for 5 of 10 female animals treated with 300 μg 
Neulasta/kg as well as for 4 of 10 male and for 9 of 10 female rats treated 
with 1000 μg Neulasta/kg. Furthermore, two of ten male animals treated 
with 1000 μg Grasustek/kg and 1 of 10 male animals treated with1000 μg 
Neulasta/kg revealed a red-stained discoloured thymus at terminal sacrifice. 
At 100, 300 or 1000 μg Grasustek or 300 or 1000 μg Neulasta/kg, the 
relative and absolute weights of the lungs and the spleen were increased. No 
differences were noted between the animals treated subcutaneously with 
1000 μg Grasustek/ kg compared to animals treated with 1000 μg 
Neulasta/kg. 
Test or reference item-related organ changes in form of increased 
granulocytopoiesis were noted in the bone marrow. Activation of 
haematopoiesis was noted in the spleen and in the liver. Further, 
granulocytosis was noted in the lungs. These changes are considered to be 
pharmacodynamic effects of the test or reference item. There was no 
difference in the effects between Grasustek and Neulasta. Test or reference 
item-related pathological changes in form of bone remodelling of the femur 
and tibia was observed. Both products showed similar effects on the bone 
structure.

Results 
Recovery period 
The relative and absolute number of lymphocytes was still slightly increased 
by 14% (rel.) or by 42% (abs.) for the male animals previously treated with 
1000 μg Grasustek/kg. The relative and absolute number of lymphocytes was 
still slightly increased by 8% (rel.) or by 15% (abs.) for the male animals 
previously treated with 1000 μg Neulasta/kg. 
Two of five male animals previously treated with 1000 μg Grasustek/kg and 1 
of 5 male animals previously treated with1000 μg Neulasta/kg showed a red-
stained discoloured thymus at recovery sacrifice. 
The results presented showed no difference observed in the pharmacodynamics and toxicological effect 
of either the biosimilar or the reference.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity 
The presence of ADAs was assessed by a validated semi-quantitative ELISA method as part of the four-
week repeated toxicity study in animals given either the test product or Neulasta at all dose levels, at 
the end of the 4-week dosing period and at the end of 4-week recovery period. Higher incidence of 
ADAs was detected for Grasustek treated animals compared to those given Neulasta without any 
consistent pattern of ADA incidence across all doses / gender. There was no apparent impact on ANCs. 
Studies on impurities 
The levels of oxidized-I form found in Grasustek are twice as high as in the reference product Neulasta. 
This level is similar to that contained in the lot used in the clinical studies (Phase I- PEGF/USV/P1/001, 
Phase III- PEGF/USV/P3/003 and Phase I- PEGF/USV/P1/003). Those batches did not show any 
relevant immunogenicity.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2) which states that proteins are exempted from the need to submit 
studies because they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment due to their nature, 
the applicant submitted a justification for not submitting an environmental risk assessment. 
Pegfilgrastim is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in 
environmental exposure is anticipated.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Comparability on the non-clinical level was adequately addressed according to the current regulatory 
requirements. Biosimilarity between Grasustek and the reference medicinal product Neulasta was 
demonstrated by similar potency to stimulate proliferation of G-NFS-60 cells (a murine myeloblastic 
cell line) and by similar receptor binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor. The applicant submitted the 
raw data (sensograms for the Biacore assay and concentration-response curves for the G-NFS-60 cell 
proliferation assay) and it was concluded that the binding affinity and potency values provided are 
reliable. 
An in vivo PK/PD study was performed in normal and neutropenic rats with the aim to compare 
Grasustek versus Neulasta. This experiment has shown a comparable activity of either product in 
terms of absolute neutrophil counts. The rate and extent of exposure resulting from a single 
administration of Grasustek or Neulasta were compared during that same study. The results of the 
pharmacokinetic analysis after a single dose tend to show similar AUC and Cmax for Grasustek and 
Neulasta. 
The applicant also conducted comparative toxicokinetic evaluations as part of a repeat-dose toxicity 
study in rats described below. The toxicokinetic investigations were conducted on Day 1 and Day 29. 
The exposures were higher in all the Neulasta groups compared to Grasustek. There was no sign of 
accumulation in either sex and the exposures appear lower after 5 weekly administrations in all the 
groups. Differences in time points of highest serum concentrations (tmax) between Grasustek and 
Neulasta can be attributed to normal variability observed between animals, small number of animals at 
each time point and non-sequential PK sampling, in line with the follow-up scientific advice 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/343876/2014. 
The Grasustek and Neulasta concentrations in the formulation vehicle and in the animal sera were 
determined by ELISA. The information provided on the validation of the commercial ELISA used to

dose the pegfilgrastim in the rat plasmas is somewhat limited to accuracy, precision and LLOQ. Further 
details would be needed, in order to be able to judge whether these data are adequate. The in vivo PK 
data are nonetheless considered as supportive only and it is considered that the in vitro assays 
described above are more informative together with the PK/PD data obtained in healthy volunteers and 
patients. 
The applicant did not provide results of distribution, metabolisation, excretion or additional studies; 
those studies are not needed. 
The applicant performed a GLP-compliant 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study (including a 4-week 
recovery period) comparing test or reference product administered once weekly on 5 occasions at 300 
or 1000 μg/kg in CD strain rats of both sexes. The results presented showed no difference observed in 
the toxicological effect of either the biosimilar or the reference.  
No particular findings were noted in a local tolerance study. The presence of ADAs was assessed as 
part of the four-week repeated toxicity study in animals. However, immunogenicity assessment in 
animals is generally not predictive for immunogenicity in humans and is thus not requested for 
biosimilars. The studies performed in animals are in this particular case not needed and the resulting 
information is somewhat limited.  
The levels of oxidized-I form found in Grasustek are twice as high as in the reference product Neulasta 
(0.23 % to 0.50 % in Grasustek lots versus 0.13% to 0.21 % in EU-authorized Neulasta lots). This 
level is similar to that contained in the lot used in the clinical studies (Phase I- PEGF/USV/P1/001, 
Phase III- PEGF/USV/P3/003 and Phase I- PEGF/USV/P1/003), where the Grasustek batches had a 
level of Oxidized-1 form ranging from 0.35-0.41% (against EU-authorized Neulasta range of 0.1-
0.2%). Those batches did not show any relevant immunogenicity.  
No data from secondary PD, safety pharmacology, pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies, single 
dose studies, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproduction, fertility and developmental toxicity studies 
was submitted. These studies are not required for a biosimilar development program in accordance 
with EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1 and EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005. 
The justification for not submitting environmental risk assessment studies is acceptable. It is unlikely 
that residues of pegfilgrastim would persist in the environment or cause inadvertent environmental 
effects. The approval of Grasustek is not expected to cause increases in environmental exposure above 
existing levels for this active substance or result in any additional hazards to the environment during 
storage, distribution, use and disposal. Considering the expected exposure and the nature of the 
product, the absence of formal environmental risk assessment studies for Grasustek is considered 
justified. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology for Grasustek have been 
well characterised and are considered acceptable. There were no further changes to the SmPC and the 
product information is aligned with the reference product Neulasta.

GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Table 5  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The PK comparability of Grasustek and Neulasta was evaluated in a pivotal PK/PD trial 
(PEGF/USV/P1/001) and a supportive PK/PD trial (PEGF/USV/P1/003). 
Analytical methods 
Pegfilgrastim assay 
A solid phase sandwich ELISA assay was developed to measure pegfilgrastim in serum and in general 
validated appropriately including evidence of similar precision and sensitivity for Neulasta and 
Grasustek from analysis of samples in the same analytical runs using Neulasta standard curves. 
Incurred sample reanalysis was used to indicate no significant matrix interference with haemolysed 
and lipaemic samples. Anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies, but not anti-PEG antibodies, may interfere in this 
assay. 
The assay measures pegfilgrastim as well as endogenous G-CSF.

Methods have been developed to measure binding ADAs. A neutralising bioassay has been developed 
using NFS-60 cells, which proliferate in the presence of G-CSF. The assay has been validated. 
Study PEGF/USV/P1/001 
Design 
This was a randomised, double-blind comparative study in healthy male and female subjects with a 2-
treatment, 2-period, 2-way crossover design. The primary objective of this pivotal PK/PD trial was to 
compare the PK and PD of Grasustek and EU-sourced Neulasta following a single SC dose of 6 mg. 
Methods 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated with non-compartmental analysis and compared using an 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) including terms for treatment, period, sequence and subject within 
sequence. 
Results 
A total of 156 subjects were randomised and administered at least one treatment dose (PK 
population); 142 subjects (91%) completed the study, 71 in each treatment sequence, and constitute 
the PK dataset. A total of 14 subjects withdrew from the study for various reasons (consent 
withdrawal, clinically significant AE, poor venous access, failure to attend period 2 on time, concurrent 
illness). 
The pegfilgrastim concentration curves over time and PK parameter estimates for the test and 
reference products are shown in Figure 7 and Table 6, respectively. The comparison of the key PK 
parameters is presented in Table 7. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio for the three key 
parameters (AUClast, Cmax, AUC0-inf) is contained within the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00-
125.00%.

Design 
This was a randomised, double-blind comparative study in healthy male subjects with a 2-treatment, 
2-period, 2-way crossover design. The primary objective of this supportive PK/PD trial was to compare 
the PD of Grasustek and EU-sourced Neulasta following a single SC dose of 2 mg. PK comparison was a 
secondary objective and was only descriptive. 
Methods 
The study was conducted according to the protocol and in the same centre as the previous trial. 
Results 
A total of 64 subjects were randomised and administered at least one treatment dose (PK population); 
60 subjects (94%) completed the study, 30 in each treatment sequence, and constitute the PK 
dataset. A total of 4 subjects withdrew from the study for various reasons (AE, consent withdrawal, 
alcohol consumption). 
The pegfilgrastim concentration curves over time and PK parameter estimates for the test and 
reference products are shown in Figure 9 and Table 9, respectively.  
Following CHMP request, formal equivalence testing has been performed, which fails to show PK 
equivalence. Although a period effect is also apparent for both products, it is only significant for one of 
the three PK parameters (AUC(0-last)).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The PD comparability of Grasustek and Neulasta was evaluated in the two trials previously described; it 
is based on two blood markers: the ANC and CD34+ cell count. 
Analytical methods 
The two PD markers were measured by flow cytometry in the same central laboratory for the two 
trials. 
Study PEGF/USV/P1/001 
PD parameters were estimated with non-compartmental analysis: AUEC (the area under the effect 
curve of the ANC and CD34+ response), Emax (the maximum effect observed of the ANC and CD34+ 
response), and Tmax (the time to reach the maximum observed effect of the ANC and CD34+ 
response). AUEC and Emax were compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including terms 
for treatment, period, sequence and subject within sequence. The baseline concentration value (pre-
dose value) was used as the covariate. A 95% CI for the ratio of the adjusted geometric means for 
Grasustek/Neulasta was calculated. In order to demonstrate comparability, the 95% CI for AUEC 
(ANC), the primary PD parameter, was to be contained within the acceptance limit of 90.00% to 
111.11%. The PD dataset was the same as the PK dataset. 
The ANC and CD34+ cell count curves over time and PD parameter estimates for the test and 
reference products are shown in Figures 10 and 11 and Tables 10 and 11, respectively. The 
comparison of the PD parameters is presented in Table 12. The 95% CI of the geometric mean ratio for 
the key parameters (AUEC and Emax) for both cell counts is contained within the pre-defined 
equivalence range of 90.00-111.11%.

The 156 pre-dose samples from all study subjects were tested.  2 were screened positive with the anti-
Grasustek (1.3%) and 13 with the anti-Neulasta assay (8.3%), one sample being screened positive 
with both assays. One follow-up sample (Neulasta/Grasustek) was confirmed weakly positive for anti-
Grasustek antibodies and screened positive for anti-Neulasta antibodies; it is possible that serum from 
this subject exhibited high non-specific binding. 
Study PEGF/USV/P1/003 
The same analysis was performed as in the previous trial, except that the 95% CI for AUEC and Emax 
for ANC (the primary PD parameters) was to be contained within wider acceptance limits (80.00 - 
125.00%). The PD dataset was the same as the PK dataset. 
The ANC and CD34+ cell count curves over time and PD parameter estimates for the test and 
reference products are shown in Figures 10 and 11 and Tables 14 and 15, respectively. The 
comparison of the PD parameters is presented in Tables 16 and 17. The 95% CI of the geometric mean 
ratio for the key parameters (AUEC and Emax) for both cell counts is contained within the pre-defined 
equivalence range of 80.00-125.00%.

Immunogenicity 
In Study PEGF/USV/P1/001, out of 454 samples, none was confirmed ADA positive. 
In Study PEGF/USV/P1/003, out of 188 samples, five samples (2.7%) from 3 subjects were confirmed 
positive; these subjects were ADA negative pre-dosing and first received Grasustek followed by 
Neulasta. Two subjects were confirmed positive after both Grasustek and Neulasta, while the last was 
negative after Neulasta. One sample had a titre of 16, whereas the other confirmed ADA positive 
samples had titres ≤ 2. All five samples were negative in the neutralising assay. 
In all three subjects, the ANC and CD34+ cell count profiles are similar after Grasustek and Neulasta. 
However, the PK profile in these three subjects shows lower pegfilgrastim concentration after Neulasta 
administered in Period 2 than after Grasustek administered in Period 1. 
Following CHMP request, an analysis of the subjects with screened positive samples was conducted.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Filgrastim (recombinant human G-CSF) and pegfilgrastim have the same mechanism of action, 
pegfilgrastim being a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. They bind 
to specific cell surface receptors, thereby stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Their PD 
effects are characterised by the elevation of ANC by release of mature neutrophils from the marrow 
into the peripheral blood and by stimulation of proliferation and differentiation of neutrophil precursors 
in the bone marrow, and mobilisation of progenitor (CD34+) cells to the peripheral blood.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 43/76 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Pegfilgrastim is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in 
adult patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy for malignancy. Therefore, ANC is a valid 
surrogate marker of efficacy while CD34+ cell count may further support the evaluation of the PD 
profile. 
The pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim are complex with both dose and time-dependency, due to 
target-mediated drug disposition; neutrophil-mediated clearance is the predominant elimination 
pathway for pegfilgrastim. 
In healthy subjects, after subcutaneous administration in a dose range of 30 to 300 μg/kg, 
pegfilgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics and exposure to pegfilgrastim increases in more than 
a dose-proportional manner, suggesting that the clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increased 
dosing. A 10-fold increase in the dose results in an approximately 25-fold increase in the maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax) and an approximately 75-fold increase in the AUC. In contrast, the 
magnitude and duration of ANC elevation is also dose dependent, but less than dose-proportionally 
(Molineux, 1999; Roskos, 2006; Yang, 2011). 
The PK and PD profiles of Grasustek and Neulasta have been compared in two trials performed in 
healthy volunteers and using the same design (single dose crossover with a wash-out period of 
approximately 4 weeks) at two different doses: the therapeutic dose of 6 mg (equivalent to 100 μg/kg 
in a 60-kg individual) and a sub-therapeutic dose of 2 mg. The 6 mg dose is considered to be 
sufficiently sensitive for both PK and PD comparison as it lies in the steep part of the dose-
concentration and dose-response curve in healthy volunteers (HVs). The additional dose of 2 mg was 
recommended by the CHMP as it might be more sensitive if G-CSF receptors are not all saturated at 
this level. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pegfilgrastim analytical assay has been appropriately validated; it shows potential interference of 
anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies, but not anti-PEG antibodies. 
The pivotal study PEGF/USV/P1/001 demonstrates PK comparability of the 6 mg dose in 142 evaluable 
subjects based on the three key PK parameters of AUC0-t, Cmax, and AUC0-∞. The 90% CI of the 
geometric mean ratio for these three parameters is contained within the standard bioequivalence range 
of 80.00-125.00%. For the terminal half-life, its estimate was not considered reliable in approximately 
half the subjects based on very strict criteria; however, comparable half-lives are shown in the subset 
of selected subjects as well as in the whole PK population. 
The second study PEGF/USV/P1/003, which was not powered to establish PK equivalence, provides 
supporting (descriptive) evidence of comparability at the dose of 2 mg although formal equivalence 
testing fails to show PK equivalence. 
There is a concern that the wash-out period between the two administrations may not be sufficient as 
a PD carry-over effect may occur due to expansion of neutrophil and neutrophil precursor mass in the 
second period and that results could be compounded by the PD effect on PK (increased drug 
clearance). Presentation of the data by period shows a significant period effect at the higher dose with 
drug exposure lower in the first period compared to the second period. Mean pegfilgrastim 
concentrations appear lower after Grasustek than Neulasta in Period 1 while the opposite is observed 
in Period 2. The magnitude of the decrease within each sequence is comparable, suggesting that the 
period effect is similar for both products. Additional analyses also suggest that differences within each 
period are chance findings and likely to be due to differences between subjects of the two sequences. 
In addition, further evaluation of the discrepancy between PK and PD results in some individuals (i.e. 
apparent different PK exposure between the two products with similar PD response) was requested but 
no specific reason for this observation could be identified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 44/76 
 
 
 
Since PK constitute a secondary objective of study PEGF/USV/P1/003, no formal statistical analysis of 
the PEG G-CSF (PK parameters (e.g. Cmax, AUC(0-last) and AUC(0-inf))) was required and descriptive 
summaries were provided as per the EMA SA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/561213/2012), Corrigendum 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/517803/2016. In line with the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/561213/2012) 
received from the CHMP to enrol only male subjects, to possibly decrease the variability of responses, 
especially since the dose is not adjusted to body weight, healthy male subjects 18 to 55 years of age 
were enrolled in this study.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The validation of flow cytometry assays and external quality assurance data are acceptable. 
The scientific advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/37301/2009) received from the CHMP recommended to 
establish PD equivalence at more than 1 dose level; at the therapeutic dose of 6 mg of Grasustek and 
EU-approved Neulasta® and a second dose, preferably lower than 6 mg and lying on the steep part of 
the dose-response curve, was observed by conducting two PD trials with such doses. The primary 
endpoints were chosen as per EMA advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/561213/2012). 
In both trials, formal testing of all four PD parameters (AUEC and Emax for ANC as well as CD34+ cell 
count) shows that the 95% CI of the geometric mean ratio lies within the pre-defined equivalence 
interval of 90.00-111.11% in the pivotal trial and 80.00-125.00% in the supportive trial. Given the 
concern about the wash-out period, presentation of the data by treatment and period was requested 
by CHMP. A significant period effect is observed at the higher dose in the pivotal trial but not at the low 
dose, as could be anticipated. The differences between Grasustek and Neulasta are consistent with 
those observed in the PK results and further investigation of this carry-over effect was requested by 
the CHMP. Extensive analyses performed by the applicant suggest that the magnitude of this effect is 
comparable between the two products and that the observed differences are likely to be due to a 
different distribution of the subjects’ responsiveness between the two sequences.  
Immunogenicity 
Anti-pegfilgrastim immune response can potentially target either moiety (PEG or G-CSF) or the linker. 
Antibodies against G-CSF appear to develop infrequently and have not been associated with relevant 
consequences for efficacy or safety. In contrast, anti-PEG antibodies have been found in healthy 
subjects at variable rates and may potentially impact on the PK and PD profile of pegfilgrastim; in 
addition, they may potentially be induced by pegfilgrastim administration. Safety issues related to anti-
PEG antibodies have not been described. 
The analytical method used in the pivotal PK/PD trial has poor sensitivity and is highly variable, which 
precludes any conclusion on the results generated. 
The binding assay used in the supportive PK/PD trial is able to detect anti-G-CSF and anti-pegfilgrastim 
but not anti-PEG antibodies, which is considered acceptable as this might not constitute a clinical 
concern.  
Re-testing of the pivotal trial samples following CHMP request did not detect any confirmed anti-
pegfilgrastim ADA in any subject. The results from the supportive PK/PD trial show the development of 
binding ADAs after administration of Grasustek in 3/32 subjects (9%) versus none after administration 
of Neulasta. Despite their low titre and no apparent impact on PD response, these are associated with 
very low pegfilgrastim concentration in the second period (Neulasta), which is consistent with 
interference shown in the additional validation of the PK assay.  
Importantly, there appears to be no difference between the rates of positive screened samples after 
Grasustek and Neulasta as well as baseline (off-drug) rates, which suggests that all these rates are 
within the range of the assay variability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 45/76 
 
 
 
Overall, this very low level of ADA incidence does not raise concern when interpreted in the light of the 
totality of evidence provided by the comparability exercise and does not preclude a conclusion of 
comparable immunogenicity profile of the test and reference products. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK, PD and immunogenicity profiles of Grasustek and Neulasta are considered comparable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study(ies) 
PEGF/USV/P3/003: A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, active controlled, parallel group, 
equivalence phase III study comparing the safety and efficacy of Grasustek and Neulasta EU in breast 
cancer patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The trial enrolled women ≥ 18 years of age, with a bodyweight within 40 and 120 kg and Eastern 
cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2; they were chemotherapy-naïve with 
histologically proven breast cancer (Stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA) eligible for six chemotherapy cycles with 
the TAC regimen (docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) as an adjuvant treatment within 60 
days of complete surgical resection of the primary breast tumour. The study was conducted in 30 
centres in seven EU and non-EU Eastern countries. The majority of treated patients were enrolled in 
Georgia (52%), with one centre accounting for 71 patients (29%). 
Treatments 
Patients received up to 6 three-week cycles of TAC chemotherapy consisting of the following sequence: 
50 mg/m2 doxorubicin, 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, and 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. A subcutaneous 
injection of 6 mg pegfilgrastim (Grasustek or Neulasta) was administered at least 24 hours after 
chemotherapy. Patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either Grasustek or Neulasta with 
stratification by country. 
Primary prophylactic antibiotic therapy was not allowed; only secondary antibiotic prophylaxis was 
allowed and was initiated upon development of episode of febrile neutropenia in accordance with the 
NCCN Practice Guidelines in Oncology). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of Grasustek compared to 
Neulasta EU with respect to the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN), which was defined as Grade 4 
neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L), during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy. 
Secondary objectives: 
The main secondary outcomes included DSN during the other cycles, and in all cycles, the depth of 
ANC nadir (lowest ANC), febrile neutropenia episodes (defined as single temperature ≥ 38.3 °C 
measured orally or ≥ 38.0 °C for over 1h; neutropenia: ANC <0.5 x 109/L or <1 x 109/L with a 
Assessment report

predicted decline to ≤0.5 x 109/L over the next 48h, ANC and temperature being measured on the 
same day); hospitalisation and time in intensive care unit (ICU) due to neutropenia complications; 
clinically documented infections and use of intravenous antibiotics. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
DSN defined as the number of days with Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) during Cycle 1 of 
chemotherapy. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
●  DSN during Cycles 2 to 6; 
●  Depth of ANC nadir, defined as the lowest ANC in Cycles 1 to 6; 
●  Febrile neutropenia episodes as previously defined (incidence) in all cycles (Note: oral 
temperature measurements twice daily for D1-14, once daily D15-21, and whenever the 
subject felt feverish); 
●  Time to neutrophil recovery, defined as the time in days from the chemotherapy administration 
until the subject’s ANC increases to > 2.0 × 109/L after the nadir in Cycle 1 (Note: in all cycles, 
full panel of haematology analysis on D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, and daily until recovery of ANC to 
>2 × 109/L after expected ANC nadir); 
●  Hospitalisation (frequency and duration) and time in intensive care unit (ICU) due to 
neutropenia complications by cycle; 
●  Clinically documented infections (incidence) by cycle; 
●  Use of intravenous antibiotics during each cycle. 
Sample size 
For the sample size determination, the following assumptions were made: expected difference in the 
means of DSN: 0.1 day; mean DSN in the reference arm: 1.8 day; common SD of DSN in both arms: 
1.4 day; one-sided significance level: 2.5%; randomisation ratio: 2:1 (Grasustek: Neulasta). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was assumed to have a negative binomial distribution. The LS Means for 
both treatment arms and differences (95% CIs) between LS Means were estimated within a general 
linear model framework, accounting for treatment arm, and applying a log link. 
Equivalence would be concluded if the 95% CI of the ratio of LS Means was entirely contained in the 
interval [0.65, 1.55]. The upper limit of that acceptance range corresponded to a 1-day difference on 
the additive scale, assuming a reference mean of 1.8 days. The lower limit was calculated to be 
symmetrical around 1 on a multiplicative scale. 
The power of the analysis was estimated within a simulation study. Data for the two treatment arms 
were generated from two negative binomial distributions, according to the assumptions. 30000 sets of 
data were generated and the proportion of cases where equivalence was concluded was considered to 
be the power estimate. With 30000 simulated cases the standard error of the power estimate was 
0.17% for an underlying true power of 90%. 
Therefore, based on the above assumptions 216 evaluable subjects (144 in Grasustek arm, 72 in 
Neulasta arm) were considered to be sufficient to achieve a 90% power at a 2.5% level of significance 
to reject both one-sided null hypotheses. The PP and FAS populations were the primary analysis 
populations. To acquire sufficient evaluable subjects for the PP population, an exclusion/dropout rate of 
15% was estimated and taken into account. Hence, a sample size of 255 patients (170 in Grasustek 
arm, 85 in Neulasta arm) was required to be randomised. However, 254 subjects were randomised as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 47/76 
 
 
 
one subject was assigned with two randomisation codes. Nevertheless, both PP and FAS populations 
included more than 216 subjects (considered to be sufficient to achieve a 90% power at a 2.5% 
significance level to reject both one-sided null hypotheses). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either Grasustek or Neulasta in a country 
stratified manner. There was a slight deviation from this planned proportion (2.097:1 instead of 2:1) 
due to usage of permuted block randomisation stratified by country. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was assessor-blinded. Unblinded staff was responsible for the preparation and 
administration of study drug. All efforts were made to conceal the identity of the study drug to the 
subject.  
Statistical methods 
The main efficacy endpoint (DSN) was obtained by adding up the days with ANC below 0.5 x 109/L 
during the first treatment cycle; in case of days with missing ANC measurement, imputation rules were 
pre-specified. DSN was assumed to have a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for 
skewness and over dispersion. The least-square means (LSMs) were estimated within a general linear 
model framework, accounting for treatment arm, and applying a log link. LS mean difference and 95% 
CI between the two treatment arms was then back-transformed by exponentiation, resulting in a ratio 
of means and its 95% CI. The primary analysis of DSN in Cycle 1 consisted in testing equivalence of 
Grasustek and Neulasta; it was performed both on the full analysis set (FAS) and the per protocol (PP) 
population. The FAS included all randomised subjects who received the study drug and had at least 
one post-baseline ANC measurement in Cycle 1. The PP set included all randomised subjects who 
received the study drug, had baseline ANC value and sufficient ANC measurements to allow for 
estimation of DSN, if present, and its subsequent recovery, and had no major deviations from the 
protocol in Cycle 1. Equivalence was concluded if the 95% CI of the ratio of means was entirely 
contained in the interval [0.65, 1.55].

Ancillary analyses 
DSN had means ≤ 1 day in most cycles and 95% CIs for their ratios ranging between 0.64 and 1.50. 
Descriptive summary statistics showed ANC nadir in the two treatment arms with a median of 0.155 x 
109/L in Cycle 1 and around 0.5 x 109/L in the subsequent cycles. Time to recovery during Cycle 1 was 
7.5 ± 4.6 days on Grasustek and 8.0 ± 5.2 days with Neulasta. 
Five patients required hospitalisation, 4 (2.4%) from Grasustek treatment arm and 1 (1.2%) from 
Neulasta treatment arm). Overall, 10 patients, all from Grasustek treatment arm, had infections, and 
likewise, 5 patients, all from Grasustek treatment arm, required i.v. antibiotic use.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy trial PEGF/USV/P3/003 compared the test and reference products in a population of 
chemotherapy-naïve women with early breast cancer receiving a TAC adjuvant chemotherapy regimen 
(doxorubicin + docetaxel + cyclophosphamide) known to be associated with significant 
myelosuppression and high probability of febrile neutropenia (> 20%). The assessor-blinded, parallel 
design with unbalanced 2:1 randomisation but stratification by country, and the trial duration of up to 
6 cycles are acceptable. The primary efficacy outcome (duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in the 
first cycle) and pre-defined equivalence margin for the means ratio of [0.65, 1.55], corresponding to ≤ 
±1 day on the additive scale, were endorsed by the CHMP. Secondary outcomes are all related to ANC, 
including febrile neutropenia. 
The trial was conducted in Eastern EU and non-EU countries; more than half of the study population 
was enrolled in Georgia. ANC measurements were performed locally and, based on the information 
provided on the assays; this is acceptable since it is only a supportive study. Information related to 
temperature, adverse events, and concomitant medications was collected in patient diaries and 
reported by the investigators in the CRF. 
The study design, study population and primary/secondary efficacy and safety endpoints were among 
others based on the Scientific Advices (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/357301/2009 and 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/343876/2014) received from the CHMP on the development of biosimilar Grasustek. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 254 patients were randomised and 248 received at least one subcutaneous injection of 6 mg 
pegfilgrastim: 166 Grasustek and 82 Neulasta; they all provided data for the primary efficacy analysis 
in the first cycle. Both FAS and PP analyses show 95% CIs for the mean DSN ratios well contained 
within the pre-specified equivalence interval. Based on these data, therapeutic equivalence between 
the test and reference products is demonstrated. 
Febrile neutropenia (FN) and associated outcomes (fever, infections, hospitalisations, use of 
antipyretics, oral and intravenous antibiotics) occurred more frequently after Grasustek than Neulasta. 
Given the low incidence of these events, the unequal treatment allocation (2:1) may have been a 
factor and, in the absence of obvious reason, it can be accepted that it is likely a chance finding. The 
overall occurrence of FN is much lower than anticipated on the basis of historical Neulasta trials (9-
13% over 4 chemotherapy cycles – Neulasta EPAR) and its level of reporting across centres/countries 
appears extremely variable. No explanation could be found for this observation. 
While FN is an important efficacy outcome, which is mentioned in the indication of Neulasta, its 
anticipated occurrence is much lower than SN and the trial was not powered for this comparison, with 
the additional caveat of unbalanced randomisation. Therefore, the uncertainty around the FN results is 
such that they are not considered to preclude efficacy equivalence between the test and reference 
products. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For the purpose of demonstrating comparable efficacy for G-CSF products, PK/PD trials are more 
sensitive than any efficacy trial in cancer patients undergoing myelosuppressive therapy. 
Notwithstanding, the efficacy data from the trial in breast cancer patients are considered supportive of 
the biosimilarity of Grasustek and Neulasta.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Healthy volunteers 
●  Study PEGF/USV/P1/001: 150 subjects received one dose (6 mg) of Grasustek and 149 subjects 
one dose (6 mg) of Neulasta 
●  Study PEGF/USV/P1/003: 62 subjects received one dose (2 mg) of Grasustek and 62 subjects one 
dose (2 mg) of Neulasta 
Breast cancer patients 
In study PEGF/USV/P3/003, most patients received 6 doses of study drug as shown in Table 22. 
Table 22: Drug exposure summary in breast cancer patients 
A total of 230 patients entered the safety follow-up and 224 patients (> 97%) completed it. 
Adverse events 
The overall summary of adverse events (AEs) reported in the three trials is presented in Tables 23 to 
25.

Table 25: Overall AE summary - PEGF/USV/P3/003 
      ** An AE is related if the recorded relationship to IMP/Comparator is 'possibly', 'probably' or 'definitely' 
Three patients treated with Grasustek reported an AE in the follow-up period; 2 were serious and one 
chemotherapy-related. 
The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in study PEGF/USV/P1/001 are 
presented in Table 26.  
Table 26: Summary of TEAEs reported by ≥ 5% subjects - PEGF/USV/P1/001 (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
The same type of TEAEs were observed in study PEGF/USV/P1/003, although at much lower 
frequencies, with the exception of upper respiratory tract infections, which were reported in about 10% 
of the subjects in both trials and are unlikely related to pegfilgrastim. The majority of TEAEs were mild 
in severity and their frequency was broadly comparable between treatment arms. 
The most common TEAEs during the treatment period of study PEGF/USV/P3/003 are presented in 
Table 27. Most AEs were judged moderate or severe.

Table 28: Bone pain - PEGF/USV/P3/003 (Safety Analysis Set) 
Each subject can be counted several times for each level of intensity. 
The denominator for percentages was the number of subjects in the respective treatment arm. 
Local tolerability was specifically investigated in the HV trials. Mild erythema was reported by about 
20% of the subjects 0.5 h after administration regardless of dose. Mild pain was reported in a small 
proportion of subjects (2-8%). Overall, injection site reactions were comparable between the two 
products. 
Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events 
No death or SAE was reported in the HV studies. 
In the breast cancer study, a patient died 10 days after Grasustek administration due to bilateral 
pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
There were 15 serious TEAEs reported by 11 subjects during the treatment period: 8 (4.8%) subjects 
from Grasustek treatment arm reported 12 serious TEAEs and 3 (3.7%) subjects from Neulasta 
treatment arm reported 3 serious TEAEs. The most frequent SAEs were febrile neutropenia and 
neutropenia. Agranulocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, breast abscess, cerebral 
infraction and ARDS were reported in 5 subjects from Grasustek treatment arm; none were considered 
related to pegfilgrastim. 
There were 2 serious TEAEs reported during the safety follow-up period both from Grasustek treatment 
arm: peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified and metastasis to central nervous system assessed as 
unlikely related/unrelated to pegfilgrastim. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Decrease in platelet count below reference value was reported by about 30% of HVs after the 6 mg 
dose and 15% after the 2 mg dose. In the 6 mg study, thrombocytopenia was reported as an AE after 
Neulasta (3 subjects; 2.0%). In addition, neutropenia was reported with the same frequency after both 
products (2 subjects; 1.3%) and one subject had high WBC counts (20 to 60 × 109/L) after both 
products. 
However, based on platelet measurements and using CTCAE classification, Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia was more frequent with Grasustek (14%) than with Neulasta (4%). No case of 
hyperleucocytosis ≥ 100 x 109/L was reported. Finally, at the end of treatment visit, 51/149 patients 
(34%) had low haemoglobin level in the Grasustek treatment arm and 35/75 (47%) in the Neulasta 
treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019

Clinical chemistry 
After both treatments in HVs at the 6 mg dose, mean values for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were 
outside the reference range at 144 h post-dose and returned to normal at 312 h post-dose. At the 2 
mg dose, the mean ALP values increased but remained within the normal range. 
Overall at the 6 mg dose, 12 (7.7%) subjects had abnormal values that were recorded as an AE. 
Increased liver enzymes were similarly reported after both products: increased ALT (5 [3.3%] vs 7 
[4.7%]) subjects), increased AST (4 [2.7%] vs 2 [1.3%] subjects), after Grasustek and Neulasta, 
respectively. At the 2 mg dose, only 2 subjects had abnormal values reported as an AE: increased ALT, 
which led to withdrawal, one after each treatment. 
Markers of liver function all increased during treatment as well as mean LDH level, similarly in both 
treatment arms. Clinically significant increases in ALT, AST, or GGT were reported as AEs in less than 
2% of the patients in both treatment arms. 
Safety in special populations 
N/A 
Immunological events 
Out of 949 samples from randomised patients in the breast cancer study, two were confirmed positive 
for anti-pegfilgrastim ADA: one pre-dose sample (positive in the Grasustek assay but negative with the 
Neulasta assay) and one post-dose sample (positive in the two confirmatory assays) after the end of 
treatment in a patient treated with Grasustek; the sample was also positive in the Nab assay and the 
titre was low (=2) in both binding and neutralising assays. In this patient, all other samples (pre-dose, 
after 3 cycles and follow-up) were negative. The DSN appeared longer (6 days) in the last 3 cycles 
than in the first 3 cycles (3-4 days) with a trend for lower ANC nadir (0-0.01 x109/L) compared to 0.06 
and 0.04 x109/L in the first 2 cycles. This patient also developed (non-serious) interstitial pneumonia 
at the end of Cycle 3 (cycle with the highest ANC peak at ~19 x109/L), which was considered 
unrelated. 
Antibodies against the new impurities of the biosimilar candidate (His-filgrastim and bovine 
recombinant enterokinase) were mainly detected in pre-dose samples (anti-His-filgrastim in 13 (5%) 
patients; anti-enterokinase in 2 patients). One patient in each treatment arm had possible drug-
induced ADAs against His-filgrastim and one patient in the Grasustek arm had possible drug-induced 
ADAs against enterokinase. 
The immunogenicity results in HVs are summarised in the Pharmacology section (3.3.2). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
In study PEGF/USV/P1/001, 4 HVs discontinued the study due to AEs. Two subjects received Grasustek 
and were withdrawn due to neutropenia (and unrelated diarrhoea, vomiting) and increased ALT/AST, 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Two subjects received Neulasta and were withdrawn 
due to abdominal pain (no splenomegaly) and tooth abscess (unrelated), respectively. 
In study PEGF/USV/P1/003, 2 HVs discontinued the study due to increased ALT/AST after 
administration of Grasustek (1) and Neulasta (1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 59/76 
 
 
 
No patient discontinued the study due to pegfilgrastim-related AE in study PEGF/USV/P3/003. Three 
patients (1.8%), all from Grasustek treatment arm, discontinued treatment due to diarrhoea (1), 
herpes zoster (1), and fatal pneumonia (1), all considered unrelated. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database comprises healthy volunteers having received a single dose of the test and 
reference products (150 HVs exposed to 6 mg and 62 HVs to 2 mg of pegfilgrastim). In addition, 166 
and 82 breast cancer patients were exposed to Grasustek and Neulasta, respectively, for up to 6 cycles 
in combination with doxorubicin, docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. 
Provided the biosimilar and the reference product exhibit comparable physicochemical and functional 
characteristics as well as comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, those adverse 
events that are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects (e.g., bone pain, leucocytosis, 
splenomegaly) can be expected to occur at similar frequencies. Therefore, the safety data from the 
breast cancer patient trial are mainly considered supportive, the more so because of the small size of 
the trial and its unbalanced randomisation. 
Regarding immunogenicity, the population of immunosuppressed breast cancer patients is far from 
sensitive, especially since pegfilgrastim is known to have low immunogenicity. This holds also true for 
the investigation of antibodies against the new impurities of the biosimilar candidate (His-filgrastim 
and bovine recombinant enterokinase) even if the multiple dose regimen is more appropriate than the 
single dose crossover design in HVs. This investigation is further hampered by the lack of robustness of 
the developed assays.  
The proportion of subjects reporting AEs, AEs judged by the investigator as related to pegfilgrastim, 
and AEs leading to trial discontinuation was broadly comparable between the test and reference 
products in the three clinical studies. 
The most common listed ADRs of pegfilgrastim (musculoskeletal and bone pain, headache, nausea, 
injection site reactions, elevated liver enzymes) were reported with similar incidences after both 
products regardless of the population, although some were confounded by chemotherapy in the breast 
cancer patients. Of note, ADRs appeared more frequent after the 6 mg dose than the 2 mg dose, as 
expected. No splenomegaly was reported in any trial. 
Substantial variations in the level of reporting occurred across centres/countries in the patient trial; in 
particular, a low incidence of ADRs (febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, injection site reactions, and 
bone pain) was reported in Georgia, which contributed to more than half of the study population. No 
explanation could be found for this observation. There also seems to be a lack of standardisation in the 
definition of haematological toxicities (e.g., clusters of leucocytosis reports in 2 centres) but no case of 
hyperleucocytosis ≥ 100 x 109/L has been reported. Notwithstanding, this does not impact the relative 
ADR incidence given the randomisation stratification by country and therefore does not constitute a 
concern regarding the biosimilarity assessment. 
Two listed uncommon ADRs of pegfilgrastim were reported in the Grasustek arm of the patient trial 
(one patient each) although not considered treatment-related by the investigator/sponsor: ARDS and 
interstitial pneumonia. However, this observation does not raise any concern on the biosimilarity of the 
products as similar rates of uncommon ADRs are not expected in such a small clinical trial, especially 
given its unequal randomisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 60/76 
 
 
 
In the breast cancer study, the changes in haematology clinical chemistry parameters were as 
expected in subjects undergoing chemotherapy, and were usually comparable between the treatment 
arms. This included decrease in WBC and platelet count, which had usually recovered by the next 
cycle, similarly in both treatment arms. 
As far as immunogenicity results from the breast cancer patient trial are concerned, one patient 
treated with Grasustek was found to have developed neutralising ADAs (likely against the G-CSF 
moiety), which seem to have prolonged the duration of severe neutropenia during the last 
chemotherapy cycles. This finding is unexpected as anti-pegfilgrastim ADAs are usually reported to be 
non-neutralising. The same imbalance in favour of Neulasta is observed in HVs, i.e. no confirmed ADAs 
developed against Neulasta vs. 3 cases against Grasustek. 
Analytical assays were also developed to detect antibodies against the impurities of the biosimilar 
candidate, namely His-filgrastim and bovine recombinant enterokinase. ADAs were detected mainly in 
pre-dose samples. Due to the lack of robustness of the assays developed, these data cannot contribute 
to the evaluation of potential immunogenicity of the impurities. However, in view of currently available 
evidence that these impurities are found at very low levels, this is not considered a concern anymore. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the test and reference products appears comparable and broadly in line with the 
product information of Neulasta, therefore supporting biosimilarity. 
The immunogenicity data show ADA development in a very small number of subjects (healthy 
volunteers and patients) only after Grasustek administration. With this very low level of ADA incidence, 
this result does not raise concern when interpreted in the light of the totality of evidence provided by 
the comparability exercise and does not preclude a conclusion of comparable immunogenicity profile of 
the test and reference products. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
Summary of safety concerns  
The applicant proposed the following summary of safety concerns in the RMP: 
Assessment report

Table 29 
Summary of safety concerns  
Discussion on safety specification 
The important identified and potential risks and missing information are in line with the current safety 
concerns of Neulasta (reference product).   
Conclusions on the safety specification  
Having considered the data in the safety specification, the Rapporteur agrees that the safety concerns 
listed by the applicant are appropriate. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
The applicant proposes to monitor all safety concerns via routine pharmacovigilance activities. As part 
of routine pharmacovigilance activities specific adverse reaction follow up questionnaires have been 
developed for the following safety concerns: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/323149/2019 
Page 62/76 
 
 
 
 
●  Capillary leak syndrome 
●  Cytokine release syndrome 
●  Medication errors including overdose 
●  Drug interaction with lithium 
●  Off-label use 
● 
Immunogenicity (incidence and clinical implications of anti-G-CSF antibodies) 
●  Risks in pregnancy and lactation 
No additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned or ongoing. This is acceptable.   
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The CHMP and PRAC, having considered the data submitted, are of the opinion that routine 
pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. The proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
The applicant proposes the below routine risk minimisation measures for Grasustek that are 
acceptable.

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC having considered the data submitted was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
Of note, for the reference product Neulasta prefilled syringes, no additional RMM are in place. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Grasustek (pegfilgrastim) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and 
authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The claimed indication for Grasustek is the same as for the reference product Neulasta: 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
The comparability exercise is based on: 
●  Quality data: an extensive comparability exercise (including side-by-side testing) which included 
14 batches of EU Neulasta and 15 batches of Grasustek DP. 
●  Non-clinical studies comparing the biosimilar candidate to EU-sourced Neulasta: 
o  an in vitro study with a murine myeloblastic cell line, comparing fifteen Grasustek batches 
(6 of the final commercial manufacturing process) versus 13  batches of Neulasta in a total 
of 6 studies 
o  an in vitro Surface Plasmon Resonance receptor binding affinity study of fifteen batches of 
Grasustek versus 14 lots of Neulasta. 
o  an in vivo PK/PD study of 3 different single doses in 72 normal and neutropenic rats. 
●  Clinical data comparing the biosimilar candidate to EU-sourced Neulasta: 
o 
two PK/PD trials of the same design (single dose, cross-over) conducted in healthy 
volunteers and using two different doses: 6 mg (therapeutic dose) for the pivotal PK/PD 
trial and 2 mg (sub-therapeutic dose) for a supportive PK/PD trial; 
o  a supportive efficacy/safety trial conducted in breast cancer patients undergoing 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles. 
The development plan appears in line with CHMP guidance and Scientific Advices received.

3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
3.2.1.  From a quality perspective 
For the biosimilarity analysis, the applicant has performed an extensive comparability exercise 
(including side-by-side testing) which included EU Neulasta and Grasustek DP. In general, all quality 
attributes analysed proved to be highly similar between Grasustek and EU Neulasta. The primary 
structure of Grasustek is identical to that of the reference medicinal product. Molecular weight and 
polydispersity indicated similar PEG moieties between Grasustek and the reference medicinal product. 
Product-related variants and impurities appeared to be somewhat higher in the reference medicinal 
product, but this is most likely due to the difference in age of reference medicinal product lots and 
Grasustek lots. In general, differences were small and not considered relevant. Importantly, relative 
potency and receptor binding kinetics were highly similar for Grasustek and the reference medicinal 
product. Comparative stability testing demonstrated that Grasustek and the reference medicinal 
product degrade in a comparable manner. In conclusion, from a quality point of view, Grasustek could 
be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta. 
3.2.2.  From a non-clinical perspective 
Comparative assessment of the pharmacodynamic effect of Grasustek and Neulasta was addressed by 
in vitro and in vivo studies which are in accordance with the European biosimilar guideline for 
(peg)filgrastim (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005) and with the scientific advice given by EMA. 
Biosimilarity of Grasustek and Neulasta could be demonstrated by comparative assessment of the 
binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor as well as of the potency to stimulate proliferation of 
myeloblastic cells. 
The results of a comparative PD/PK study in healthy and neutropenic rats provided an increase and 
dose-response in overall leukocyte levels and in neutrophil granulocyte levels after treatment with 
Grasustek and Neulasta. 
The selected methods and procedures appear appropriate. No relevant differences between Grasustek 
and Neulasta became obvious. 
3.2.3.  From a clinical perspective 
PK comparability is considered established in the pivotal PK/PD trial based on the 90% CI of the 
geometric mean ratio for the three key parameters (AUC0-t, Cmax, and AUC0-∞) that is contained within 
the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00-125.00%. Descriptive results of the same parameters 
estimated for the 2 mg dose further support PK comparability. 
PD comparability is considered established in both PK/PD trials based on the 95% CI of the geometric 
mean ratio for all four PD parameters (AUEC and Emax for ANC as well as CD34+ cell count) that is 
contained within the pre-specified equivalence interval of 90.00-111.11% in the pivotal trial and 
80.00-125.00% in the supportive trial. 
Comparable efficacy is considered established since both FAS and PP analyses show that the 95% CI 
for the ratio of mean duration of severe neutropenia (primary efficacy outcome) is well contained 
within the pre-specified equivalence interval [0.65, 1.55]. In the FAS analysis, the mean DSN was 1.58 
days with Grasustek and 1.65 days for Neulasta; on the additive scale, the maximum possible 
difference would be less than half a day.

Safety data from the three trials show similar safety profile for the test and reference products, which 
is in line with the product information of Neulasta. The most common listed ADRs of pegfilgrastim 
(musculoskeletal and bone pain, headache, nausea, injection site reactions, elevated liver enzymes) 
were reported with similar incidences after both products regardless of the population, although some 
were confounded by chemotherapy in the breast cancer patients. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
3.3.1.  From a quality perspective 
From a quality point of view, Grasustek can be considered as biosimilar to EU Neulasta. 
3.3.2.  From a non-clinical perspective 
The additional requested raw data regarding both the Biacore receptor binding and the cell proliferation 
assays were submitted. This additional information confirmed the conclusions regarding biosimilarity. 
The in vivo PD/PK study had some shortcomings such as limitations of the neutropenic animal model 
as well as small group size. Thus, the study was only evaluated descriptively and a definite conclusion 
on biosimilarity could not be drawn. This uncertainty is considered to be minor as quality, non-clinical 
in vitro and clinical data are regarded more relevant. 
3.3.3.  From a clinical perspective 
A significant period effect is observed in the pivotal PK/PD crossover trial at the 6 mg dose, but not at 
the lower dose. The ANC response is higher after the second administration, and as a result, the drug 
exposure is lower, compared to the first administration. This is consistent with a carry-over effect of 
pegfilgrastim on the expansion of the neutrophil mass. As this could potentially confound the 
comparison between the two products, further investigation of this effect was requested, which 
suggested it is of similar magnitude for the two products. 
In the breast cancer trial, the incidence of a number of adverse drug reactions appears lower than 
anticipated, which may be due to general issues in reporting, especially in the main recruiting country. 
However, this generally affected both treatment arms, and therefore, does not impact the 
comparability assessment. A few numerical differences regarding febrile neutropenia, infections and 
the isolated haematological finding of thrombocytopenia (while other cell lineages do not reveal 
differences) are likely to be chance findings, especially given the unequal randomisation. 
As far as the evaluation of immunogenicity is concerned, confirmed anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies have 
only been detected in three HVs and one patient treated with Grasustek. As the screening and 
confirmatory cut points of the analytical assay are close, screened positive samples are also important 
to consider and their proportion is similar with both products. Given these small numbers, the 
numerical imbalance in confirmed ADAs does not preclude a conclusion of comparable immunogenicity 
profile of the test and reference products. 
3.4.  Discussion on biosimilarity 
From a quality perspective 
For a biosimilar, the benefit-risk balance is derived from the reference product provided the totality of 
evidence collected from the quality and clinical data package supports the comparability of both 
products; the animal study conducted does not contribute to the judgement about biosimilarity. 
The quality data is in general supportive of comparable respective profiles.

From a non-clinical perspective 
The non-clinical biosimilarity program comprised comparative assessment of in vitro PD effects as well 
as an in vivo PD/PK study. The results of the in vitro assays support biosimilarity. The in vivo study has 
however little additive value for the comparability exercise, and is regarded to have only supportive 
character.  
In conclusion, from a non-clinical perspective the requirements for biosimilarity assessment have been 
met and sufficient evidence for the demonstration of biosimilarity has been provided. 
From a clinical perspective 
PK/PD trials are the cornerstone of the comparability exercise for biosimilar G-CSF products as they 
are more sensitive than any efficacy trial in patients to demonstrate comparable efficacy. The PK and 
PD profiles of Grasustek are comparable to those of Neulasta at two different doses, which makes the 
conclusion especially robust. A significant period effect is observed in the pivotal trial at the higher 
dose, consistent with the known PD carry-over effect of pegfilgrastim, but it appears to be of similar 
magnitude for both products. 
This PK/PD results are further supported by comparable efficacy in breast cancer patients undergoing 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy, who showed very similar duration of severe neutropenia with the two 
products. The study was not powered for the secondary efficacy outcome of febrile neutropenia, an 
uncommon event, and therefore, the uncertainty around this result does not preclude therapeutic 
equivalence between Grasustek and Neulasta. 
Provided the biosimilar and the reference product exhibit comparable physicochemical and functional 
characteristics as well as comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, those adverse 
events that are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects (e.g., bone pain, leucocytosis, 
splenomegaly) can be expected to occur at similar frequencies. Therefore, the safety data from the 
breast cancer patient trial are mainly considered supportive, the more so because of the small size of 
the trial and its unbalanced randomisation. For this reason, the observation of two uncommon ADRs of 
pegfilgrastim (interstitial pneumonia and ARDS) after Grasustek does not raise any concern on the 
biosimilarity of the products. 
Otherwise, the safety profiles of Grasustek and Neulasta appear broadly comparable. The uncertainty 
around the incidence of some ADRs due to inconsistencies across centres/countries does not impact 
the relative ADR incidence given the randomisation stratification by country and therefore is not a 
concern for the biosimilarity assessment. 
Finally, the immunogenicity of pegfilgrastim is known to be low and immunosuppressed patients, the 
only target population of Neulasta, are not a sensitive population for the detection of potential 
differences between the test and reference products. Because of the very low level of ADA incidence, 
the numerical imbalance in confirmed ADAs does not preclude a conclusion of comparable 
immunogenicity profile of the test and reference products and has to be interpreted within the totality 
of evidence of the comparability exercise. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Not applicable as comparable efficacy and safety have been shown in the indication of Neulasta.  
3.6.  Additional considerations  
None.

3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Grasustek is considered biosimilar to Neulasta. Therefore, 
a benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Grasustek is favourable in the following indication: 
“Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes)”

This non-interventional study  E2080-E044-401 aimed at 
E2080-E044-401, the European registry of anti-
epileptic drug use in patients with Lennox-Gastaut 
Syndrome (LGS), listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP, in order to fulfil MEA 002.1. This is a non-
interventional EU registry study entering patients 
(aged ≥4 years) with LGS who required a 
modification in anti-epileptic therapy (either the 
addition of another AED or the change of one drug to 
another) to evaluate the long-term safety of 
rufinamide. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
evaluating the long-term safety of rufinamide and seizure 
control during follow-up. Considering the limited number of 
patients enrolled in the study, the efficacy results are 
considered informative but not conclusive. They provided 
interesting qualitative information on the LGS response to 
different treatment in a non-interventional use and no 
significant differences between rufinamide group and other 
anti-epileptic drugs were observed. The safety profile in 
this study was consistent with the known safety profile of 
rufinamide. Overall, the results presented are consistent 
with the know efficacy and safety profile of Inovelon and 
did not warrant amendment to the product information.

amendments were made to SmPC sections 4.4 and

labelling and Package Leaflets for the three

In addition, discrepancies were noted between the CCDS

interaction of rufinamide on phenythoin clearance. The 
information were only mentioned in the CCDS. The MAH 
was requested to argue the reason of the missing data in

Based on the review of the available information, the CHMP

of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers the 
benefit/risk profile of Inovelon continues to be favourable. 
Following the introduction of the new oral formulation, the 
MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs.

a lower maximum dose of Inovelon is recommended for 
patients under 30 kg also taking valproate medication. 
Therefore, if doctors prescribe or recommend an additional 
treatment for epilepsy (e.g. valproate) patient must tell 
them that they are taking Inovelon. Their dose may then 
need adjusting. 
In particular, following the evaluation of additional studies 
for children under 30 kg also receiving valproate treatment, 
the maximum recommended daily dose was increased from 
400 to 600 mg/day.

The MAH performed a QTc study to evaluate the effect of 
Characteristics with information on the findings of 
the QTc study E2080-A001-002, which showed that 
inovelon produced a decrease in QTc interval.

inovelon compared to that of placebo on ventricular 
repolarization in healthy subjects. The study showed that 
rufinamide produced a decrease in QTc interval proportional 
to concentration.  
Although the underlying mechanism and  relevance of this 
finding is not known, the CHMP recommended clinicians to 
use their clinical judgment when assessing whether to 
prescribe rufinamide to patients at risk from further 
shortening their QTc duration (eg. Congenital short QT 
syndrome or patients with a family history of such a 
syndrome)".

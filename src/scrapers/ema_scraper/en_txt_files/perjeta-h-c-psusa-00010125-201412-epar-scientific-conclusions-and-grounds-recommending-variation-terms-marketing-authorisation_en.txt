Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for PERTUZUMAB, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials data document that pertuzumab is associated with diarrhoea. Grade 3/4 
diarrhoea is an Important Identified Risk in the Risk Management Plan (toxicity and Clinical Trials 
data), and a recently published study found the frequency of diarrhoea to be 28.1 % in the 
pertuzumab vs. 14.2% in the control-arm. Additionaly, grade 3/4 diarrhoea is described in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics as one of the most common serious adverse drug reactions.  
In the provided data of events of diarrhoea received from Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing 
experience, from the 22 patients with reporting grade>3 diarrhoea, only 3 patients were reported to 
have received treatment for diarrhoea, which is an indicator that further advice to prescribers may be 
required.  
Adverse consequences of diarrhoea – notably dehydration and electrolyte imbalance – can be 
prevented by early institution of anti-diarrhoeal medication, and fluid and electrolyte substitution. In 
light of the requirement for further advice, it is recommended that a warning regarding ‘diarrhoea’ 
should be specifically included in section 4.4 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. The Package 
Leaflet is to be updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding pertuzumab, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for PERTUZUMAB the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal products containing PERTUZUMAB is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

Pregnancy 
Dolutegravir crosses the placenta in humans. In pregnant 
women living with HIV, the median foetal umbilical cord 
concentration of dolutegravir was approximately 1.3-fold 
greater compared with the maternal peripheral plasma 
concentration. 
There is insufficient information on the effects of 
dolutegravir on neonates. 
Breast-feeding 
A median dolutegravir breast milk to maternal plasma ratio 
of 0.033 has been shown.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Following the finalisation of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/WS1810 concerning submission of 
EuroSIDA (category 3 PASS) study, this Type II 
worksharing variation was proposed to address the 
removal of three important risks (Dolutegravir 
Hypersensitivity reactions, Hepatobiliary reactions 
and Serious rash) from all four dolutegravir-
containing product EU-RMPs; Tivicay (dolutegravir), 
Triumeq (dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine), Dovato 
(dolutegravir/lamivudine) and Juluca 
(dolutegravir/rilpivirine) - i.e. deletion of safety 
concerns.  
In addition, the MAH took opportunity to propose a 
harmonisation of the risks across all four 
dolutegravir-containing product EU-RMPs and other 
minor updates (including study details and 
epidemiology data). 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed 
amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add “completed 
suicide” to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
with frequency ”rare” in the dolutegravir (Tivicay), 
dolutegravir/ abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq) and 
dolutegravir/lamivudine (Dovato) following the 
finalisation of PSUSA procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010075/202101 (reporting 
period 17 Jan 2020 to 16 Jan 2021) based on reports 
of completed suicide from participants exposed to 
dolutegravir containing regimen in ViiV Healthcare-
sponsored clinical trials. As the changes impact all 
dolutegravir containing products, the MAH submitted 
a worksharing procedure to include 
Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (Juluca) product in 
accordance with Article 20 (worksharing procedure) 
of Commission Regulation (EC) 1234/2008. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in section 4 with a rather 
identical wording.  
The proposed wording should be as follows (identical 
with the suggested wording by the MAH regarding 
Dovato (footnote instead of brackets for the 
explanatory wording is acceptable to be in line with 
already included footnote on suicidal ideation and 
suicide attempt), Triumeq and Juluca. Nevertheless, 
the wording in section 4 for Tivicay is not exactly the 
same as for the other three products and should be 
therefore adapted accordingly).  
Furthermore, it could be considered to add a 
Page 8/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
statement for patients in section of the PL that they 
should consult their doctor especially if 
neuropsychiatric side effects occur, since only under

exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance 
≥50 mL/min. There are no safety data from randomized, 
controlled trials comparing Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir to the individual components in patients 
with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who 
received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the original 
lamivudine registrational trials in combination with 
zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were associated 
with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia 
and anaemia), although discontinuations due to 
neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. 
Other lamivudine-related adverse events (such as gastro-
intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. 
The CHMP considered that, with the exception of Epivir, the 
previous recommendations to adjust the dose in patients 
with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 
mL/min can be removed. 
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 
and 49 mL/min who receive Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ 
Triumeq/ Trizivir should be monitored for lamivudine-
related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If 
new or worsening neutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose 
adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing 
information, is indicated, which cannot be achieved with 
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir.  
Combivir/Dovato/ Kivexa/ Triumeq/ Trizivir should be 
discontinued and the individual components should be used 
to construct the treatment regimen. 
The existing dose recommendations for Epivir have been 
maintained. The CHMP considered the lack of impact on pill 
burden when the lamivudine dose is adjusted for a 
monocomponent product and the fact that dose 
Page 10/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjustments may be still used for subjects initially treated 
with lamivudine-containing fixed dose combinations, but 
requiring dose-adjusted individual components 
administration for safety reasons.

the safety information regarding the occurrence of 
neural tube defects with the dolutegravir -containing 
regimens based on the interim analysis from the 
Tsepamo study. This is a birth outcomes surveillance 
study being conducted in Botswana that was 
designed to evaluate adverse birth outcomes by HIV 
status and antiretroviral regimen, and to determine if 
there is an increased risk of neural tube defects 
among infants exposed to efavirenz at conception. 
This surveillance system captures all antiretroviral 
exposure including dolutegravir. The PL is updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

Dovato (dolutegravir-based products) has been updated to 
include safety information regarding the occurrence of 
neural tube defects (NTDs) with  dolutegravir (DTG)-
containing regimens based on interim analysis from a birth 
outcomes surveillance study being conducted in Botswana 
(the Tsepamo study). This is an observational cohort study 
focusing on the safety of antiretroviral therapy during 
pregnancy and was designed to evaluate adverse birth 
outcomes by HIV status and antiretroviral regimen. 
The assessment of the latest results (July 2020) from the 
study shows a small increase of neural tube defects; 7 
cases in 3,591 deliveries (0.19%; 95% CI 0.09%, 0.40%) 
to mothers taking dolutegravir-containing regimens at the 
time of conception compared to 21 cases in 19,361

DTG regimens at the time of conception. 
The SmPC has been updated to include advice for women 
of childbearing potential to be counselled about the 
potential risk of NTD with DTG, including consideration of 
effective contraceptive measures. 
In addition, a recommendation to discuss the benefits and 
risks of continuing DTG versus switching to another 
antiretroviral regimen has been added in the case when a 
pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester while on DTG.

concurrent administration of dolutegravir with medicinal 
products with narrow therapeutic windows, that are

Fampridine is a substrate of OCT2 with a narrow

seizures at elevated concentrations. 
While the proposed interaction has not been formally 
investigated in a drug interaction study for dolutegravir, 
the contradiction is accepted given the information stated 
in the approved product labelling for fampridine, and the 
understanding of dolutegravir potential to inhibit OCT2.

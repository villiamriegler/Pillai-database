SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1 
Introduction 
Sildenafil  citrate  is  a  potent  and  specific  inhibitor  of  phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE5).  It  was 
originally  approved  in  1998  for  the  treatment  of  male  erectile  dysfunction  (MED),  under  the  trade 
name Viagra, in both the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) (EMEA/H/C/202). Later, 
sildenafil  citrate  was  approved  for:    treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
classified  as  WHO  functional  class  III,  to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in 
primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective  tissue 
disease under the trade name Revatio, in the USA and the EU in 2005.  
Pulmonary hypertension is a rare, progressive and life threatening disease. The currently available oral 
therapies have all been approved for daily administration on a long-term basis. However, patients with 
PAH  may  find  themselves  in  clinical  settings  where  they  are  temporarily  unable  to  take  oral 
medications or unable to absorb medications enterally. This includes clinical scenarios such as acute 
gastrointestinal disturbance, malabsorption due to complications of connective tissue disease, sudden 
illness  involving  diarrhoea  and  vomiting  or  peri-operatively.    Especially  in  the  latter  cases,  PAH 
patients  are  at  a  higher  risk  for  major  complications  including  pulmonary  hypertensive  crisis,  right-
sided heart failure and cardiac arrest. Review of the MAH’s clinical trial database did not suggest that 
short-term  interruption  of  oral  therapy  was  associated  with  immediate  or  rapid  worsening  of  the 
symptoms  of  PAH  in  patients  who  had  otherwise  been  on  stable  therapy.  However,  it  is  potentially 
disadvantageous  to  the  patient  that,  in  such  circumstances,  with  no  other  sildenafil  formulation 
currently available, the physician has no option but to either interrupt treatment, even if continuation 
of  therapy  was  felt  to be  in  the  patient’s  best  interest,  or  to  initiate  an  alternative  therapy  which  the 
patient  may  not  be  able  to  tolerate.  For  these  reasons,  maintenance  of  effective  therapy  can  be 
considered important.  
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  filed  an  extension  application  for  Revatio  0.8  mg/ml, 
solution for injection, in accordance with Annex II of the Commission Regulation EC No 1085/2003. 
This application meets the criteria of a new pharmaceutical form, strength and route of administration 
for Revatio 20 mg tablets. 
The proposed therapeutic indication for Revatio solution for injection is:  
“Revatio  solution  for  injection  is  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
who are currently prescribed oral Revatio and who are temporarily unable to take oral medicine, but 
are otherwise clinically and haemodynamically stable. 
Revatio (oral) is indicated for treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as 
WHO  functional  class  II  and  III,  to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  primary 
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease.” 
1.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
The medicinal product Revatio 0.8 mg/ml solution for injection is presented as a vial containing 50 ml 
clear,  colourless,  sterile  solution.  Each  50  ml  vial  contains  40 mg  of  sildenafil  (as  citrate),  therefore 
12.5 ml contains 10 mg of sildenafil. The excipients present in this medicinal product are glucose and 
water  for  injections.  The  medicinal  product  is  packed  in  a  50  mL  clear  Type  I  glass  vial  with  a 
chlorobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium overseal, and is for single use only. 
Active Substance 
The active substance, sildenafil citrate, is a known active substance; however, it is not described in the 
European, British or US Pharmacopoeia. The active substance used in the manufacturing of Revatio 
0.8 mg/ml  solution  for  injection  is  identical  to  the  one  used  in  the  manufacturing  of  the  currently 
authorized presentation; Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablets (EU/1/05/318/001). Therefore the applicant 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
referred  to  the  active  substance  information  which  was  submitted  for  the  already  authorised  film-
coated tablets. Only limited new information on the active substance has been submitted. 
The active substance manufacturing process is the same as for the Revatio tablets, except that also the 
endotoxin limit of water is controlled in the current manufacturing process.  
The  active  substance  specifications  are  similar  to  the  already  marketed  Revatio  tablets,  except  for 
stricter limits for a specified impurity and total amount of impurities and with additional requirements 
for  endotoxin  limit.  The  specifications  are  considered  acceptable  and  comply  with  the  European 
guidelines.  Batch  analytical  data  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  active  substance  specifications 
have been provided for three pilot scale batches and for four additional batches manufactured during 
development and for clinical batches. No new stability data have been provided and reference is made 
to Revatio tablets for the stability data of the active substance.  
Medicinal Product 
  Pharmaceutical Development 
Revatio  solution  for  injection  has  been  developed  to  offer  an  alternative  pharmaceutical  form  and 
route of administration for patients unable to take the oral tablet. The aim was to develop a ready-to-
use aqueous solution with minimal excipients and optimal physiological compatibility. Conventional 
excipients  have  been  selected  for  this  formulation;  glucose  as  tonicity  modifier  and  water  for 
injections as vehicle. Furthermore, nitrogen is used as a processing aid. All excipients comply with the 
Ph.  Eur.  The  glucose  specifications  include  additional  test  for  microbiological  quality.  The 
pharmaceutical  development  of  the  medicinal  product  has  been  adequately  described,  the  choice  of 
excipients is justified and their functions explained. 
At  the  time  of  the  opinion,  there  is  one outstanding  issue  in  relation  to  the  vial  size.  Since  the  dose 
administered is only 12.5 ml and the medicinal product is for single use only, it is considered that a 
smaller  vial  size  than  the  current  50  ml  vials  should  be  developed.  The  applicant  has  committed  to 
replace the 50 ml vial by a 20 ml vial presentation containing a nominal fill volume of 12.5 ml (10 mg 
sildenafil) as a post-approval follow-up measure. 
  Adventitious Agents 
There are no substances of ruminant animal origin present in the product nor have any been used in the 
manufacturing of this product. Consequently, a theoretical risk of transmitting TSE can be excluded. 
  Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is a standard manufacturing process for solutions for injection. The process 
involves  the  following  stages:  bulk  product  compounding,  filtration,  filling  into  vials  and  terminal 
sterilization.  The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described  and  validated  according  to  relevant 
European guidelines. Process validation data for this medicinal product have been presented for three 
commercial scale batches. An adequate manufacturing process validation scheme has been submitted 
and additional process validation for the filling process will be performed post authorization. 
  Product Specification 
The product specifications include adequate tests for appearance, identity, assay, degradation products, 
(sub-)  visual  particles,  sterility,  bacterial  endotoxins,  pH,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  and  extractable 
volume.  The  release  and  shelf  life  excipients  are  similar,  except  for  the  limit  of  a  glucose  derived 
degradation  product.  The  analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated.  Batch 
analytical  data  from  the  proposed  production  site  have  been  provided  on  three  commercial  scale 
batches, demonstrating compliance with the release specifications. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Stability of the Product 
Stability data on the product have been provided for three full scale batches stored at 25°C/60% RH 
(36 months) and/or 30°/65% RH (36 months) and/or 40°C/75% RH (6 months). The conditions used 
in the stability studies are according to the ICH stability guideline. In addition, one of these batches 
was stored at 50ºC/20%RH during 3 months and 5ºC during 36 months. 
The  batches  were  stored  in  Type  I  clear  glass  vial  with  chlorobutyl  rubber  stopper  and  aluminium 
overseal.  No  clear  trends  were  observed  at  all  storage  temperatures,  except  for  the  content  of  one 
impurity. Although an increase was seen for that impurity over time, the amount remained within the 
proposed  shelf  life  limits.  Therefore,  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  condition  are  justified.  In 
addition, the results of the photostability study and the temperature cycling studies sufficiently justify 
the absence of the additional storage conditions.  
The stability data were generated by validated and stability indicating methods. Based on the stability 
data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance used in the manufacture of the film-coated tablets is exactly the same as for the 
already authorized presentations.  
The manufacturing process of the solution for injection, and excipients used are appropriate and well 
controlled. Appropriate finished product specifications have been set.  
Batch analysis results show that the medicinal product can be reproducibility manufactured, compliant 
with  the  finished  product  specifications,  and  therefore  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and 
uniform performance in clinic. Stability data show that the medicinal product is stable until the end of 
the proposed shelf life.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
benefit-risk-  balance  of  the  product.  The  applicant  committed  to  resolve  it  as  follow  up  measure(s) 
after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
1.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
No  new  information  regarding  the  pharmacology  was  provided  which  was  acceptable  as  the 
pharmacology of sildenafil is well-known. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption,  distribution  and  excretion  studies  were  not  conducted  in  this  extension  application  for 
intravenous  administration,  since  most  kinetic  studies  were  performed  for  oral  administration  of 
Revatio. Three in vitro pharmacokinetic studies have been performed: 
 
 
 
In vitro metabolism of sildenafil by CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 [DM-04-148-39 (DM39)] 
In  vitro  metabolism  of  UK-92,480  in  human  liver  microsomes:  enzymology  of  UK-150,564 
formation [DM-04-148-40 (DM40)].   
In vitro cytochrome P450 inhibition studies on CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 by sildenafil in human 
liver microsomes [DM-04-148-38 (DM38)].   
These three new pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in compliance with GLP. The studies 
were however of sufficient quality. 
Absorption: Comparison of Plasma Concentrations in Toxicology Studies and in Humans 
According  to  the  MAH,  some  of  the  information  contained  within  this  section  has  been  previously 
submitted in the initial marketing authorization application. Some additional comparisons have been 
made to specifically support this Extension Application. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Given  the  species  differences  in  plasma  protein  binding,  it  is  considered  appropriate  to  compare 
exposure in animals and humans using unbound plasma concentrations of sildenafil and UK-103,320 
(a circulating metabolite formed by demethylation at the N-methyl-piperazine moiety). 
Toxicokinetic samples were not collected during the intravenous toxicology studies; therefore, Cmax 
values  have  been  extrapolated  from  intravenous  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rat  (4 mg/kg)  and  dog 
(1 mg/kg).    Pharmacokinetic  data  have  not  been  determined  in  clinical  studies  following  a  10 mg 
three-times daily (TID) intravenous infusion of sildenafil over 5 minutes; therefore, exposure data has 
been calculated (study report “Two compartmental analysis of pharmacokinetics in Study 148-203”) 
based on a 20 mg single intravenous infusion over 40 minutes from study 148-203.  
Systemic exposure (in terms of AUC) following an intravenous dose of 10 mg TID over 5 minutes to 
human  is  projected  to  be  similar  to  that  following  the  recommended  therapeutic  oral  dose  of  20 mg 
TID (see section 2.7.2.3.4).  Therefore, the chronic oral toxicology and human safety data support the 
extension application of Revatio solution for injection (for intravenous use) in terms of AUC. 
unbound  Cmax; 
In  terms  of  Cmax,  systemic  exposure  following  an  intravenous  dose  of  10 mg  TID  to  human  is 
projected  to  be  lower  than  that  following  100 mg  oral  administration  (sildenafil  unbound  Cmax; 
submitted:  Viagra 
22 ng/mL,  UK-103,320 
EMEA/H/C/000202)).  Given the change, however, from oral to intravenous administration as a slow 
bolus  injection  (over  5  minutes),  separate  consideration  has  still  been  given  to  acute  exposure  as 
reflected  by  Cmax  (see  Table 1  and  Table 2).    At  the  no  observed  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  in 
male  and  female  rat  and  dog,  the  Cmax  of  sildenafil  and  UK-103,320  are  substantially  greater  than 
that projected in human following a 10 mg intravenous dose (5 minute infusion).  Thus, when data for 
both parent compound and UK-103,320 are considered, the exposure multiples (see Table 2) indicate a 
clear separation between clinical exposure in human up to the expected maximum clinical intravenous 
dose of 10 mg TID (over 5 minutes) and the exposure associated with toxicity in rat and dog.

Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism 
The  metabolism  of  sildenafil  by  CYP3A4  and  CYP3A7  has  been  investigated  using  recombinant 
enzymes, with midazolam and fentanyl (CYP3A substrates) as comparators. All three substrates were 
metabolised by rCYP3A4 with the most rapid rate observed for midazolam, followed by sildenafil and 
slowest with fentanyl. By comparison, intrinsic clearance with rCYP3A7 was much lower for all three 
substrates,  however  the  relative  rates  of  metabolism  for  sildenafil  and  midazolam  were  reversed, 
suggesting  sildenafil  to  be  a  better  substrate  for  CYP3A7  than  both  midazolam  or  fentanyl.  Thus, 
sildenafil  is  a  substrate  for  CYP3A7,  but  intrinsic  clearance  in  recombinant  supersomes  is 
approximately 25-fold lower than that of CYP3A4 (study DM39). 
UK-150,564  is  the  N,N-de-ethylated  metabolite  of  UK-092,480  in  man.  The  formation  of  this 
metabolite has been studied in human liver microsomes and the cytochromes P450 enzymes mediating 
this transformation identified. In human liver microsomes the metabolic pathway was characterised by 
single enzyme kinetics with a Km of 20.97 μM. Further characterisation of UK-150,564 formation was 
investigated using specific CYP inhibitors in human liver microsomes. Incubations in the presence of 
furafylline, sulphaphenazole, benzylnirvarnol, and quinidine, inhibitors of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 
2D6  respectively,  showed  no  significant  inhibition  of  UK-150,564  formation.  However,  in  the 
presence  of  the  specific  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  ketoconazole,  there  was  a  significant  reduction  in  UK-
150,564  formation.  Together,  these  data  indicate  that  formation  of  UK-150,564  is  mediated  through 
CYP3A4 (study DM40). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro inhibition 
The potential for sildenafil to inhibit the activity of the drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes 
CYP2B6  and  CYP2C8  has  been  studied  in  vitro  in  human  liver  microsomes.  Sildenafil  was 
demonstrated to be a weak inhibitor of cytochrome  P450 activity with estimated IC50 values of >30 
μM against each of the enzymes investigated (study DM38). Sildenafil is therefore unlikely to inhibit 
the  metabolism  of  substrates  for  CYP2B6  and  CYP2C8  in  the  clinic.  Previously  submitted  studies 
showed  IC50  values  >300  μM  for  CYP1A2,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1  and  CYP3A4.  The  IC50 
value for CYP2C9 was 150 μM (Ki 80 μM). 
Excretion 
No additional information was submitted in the extension application. 
Toxicology 
No additional toxicology studies have been conducted for this application. Summaries were provided 
of intravenous repeated-dose studies in rats and dogs and of an intra-arterial local tolerance study in 
rabbits that were already present in the initial marketing authorisation application.  
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Intravenous  studies  that  were  performed  in  rats  and  dogs,  in  both  species  of  2  weeks  and  1  month 
duration.  
Rats 
A noteworthy finding which was observed in intravenous studies in rats, compared to oral studies over 
the dose range 0.5-10 mg/kg was a slight increase in the incidence and severity of foci of myocardial 
inflammation at 4 mg/kg in the 1-month study relative to the concurrent control.  Foci of myocardial 
inflammation  varied  from  a  minimal  (grade  1)  lesion,  composed  of  small,  rare  foci  of  mononuclear 
cells  surrounding  occasional  necrotic  myocytes,  to  mild  (grade  2)  lesion,  characterized  by  discrete 
coalescent foci with a linear shape.  Mild lesions were located within the right ventricular wall only.  
These  lesions  were  more  often  observed  in  males  than  in  females,  and  appeared  to  have  a  slightly 
higher incidence in high-dose animals than in controls.  The relationship of this finding to treatment is 
uncertain, given that similar changes were observed in controls and the absence of this finding in a 4-
week or 6-month oral toxicity study (Study numbers 90143 and 91098 respectively).  
The MAH considered the apparent increase in the incidence and severity of myocardial inflammation 
in the 1-month IV study as not a toxicological hazard to humans.  
intravenous  administration  of 
Dogs 
The 
study  at  doses  of  
5  and  10 mg/kg  produced  liquid  feces,  an  attenuation  of  the  pupillary  reflex  and  at  10 mg/kg, 
reddening of the conjunctiva and ear pinnae.  An increase in heart rate occurred at 10 mg/kg, and to a 
lesser extent at 5 mg/kg.  In the high-dose group, there were increases in plasma cholesterol and liver 
weight.  In the pivotal 1-month study, sildenafil at doses up to 4 mg/kg produced no treatment-related 
effects, defining 4 mg/kg as the IV NOAEL in dogs.

Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetics  were  not  determined  in  the  intravenous  toxicology  studies.  However,  the  MAH  has 
shown that minimal accumulation of sildenafil is expected in human. The safety is guaranteed by the 
fact that 80 mg oral dose t.i.d. was well tolerated in human and therefore no concern is expected by the 
dose of 10 mg i.v. t.i.d (comparable to 20 mg oral dose t.i.d.).  
Local tolerance: Intra-arterial study in rabbits 
A study examining intra-arterial tolerance after a single injection was conducted in rabbit (Study No. 
91073). A group of 4 female rabbits received a single 0.5 mL injection of sildenafil at the maximum 
practicable concentration of 2 mg/mL in aqueous 5% mannitol via the left ear artery. In addition to the 
untreated contralateral ear  which served as a control, a further group of 4 control rabbits was dosed 
with  the  vehicle  alone.  Half  the  animals  were  sacrificed  on  Day  3  and  half  on  Day  21  with  all  ear

artery  sites  being  examined  microscopically.  There  was  no  evidence  of  treatment-induced  local 
irritation at this 2 mg/mL concentration which represents 2.5 times the proposed clinical formulation 
strength (0.8 mg/mL). 
Local tolerance was also studied in available repeated dose studies with intravenous administration. 
These studies showed no additional intolerance in sildenafil-treated injection sites compared to the 
control sites. 
Antigenicity 
Antigenicity  of  sildenafil  was  investigated  in  guinea  pigs  in  the  Viagra  dossier  following  oral  or 
subcutaneous administration. No evidence of antigenic potential was observed. 
Studies on impurities 
The bulk lots of sildenafil used in the toxicology studies had impurity profiles which embraced those 
of the compound tested clinically and the proposed commercialised product.  Overall the sildenafil 
toxicology programme supports the drug substance specification limit for the specified impurity UK-
263,909 of 0.3% maximum and the individual unspecified impurity limit of 0.1% maximum.  
According to the MAH, the 0.2% specification limit for the residual solvent 2-butanone is below the 
0.5% justification threshold described in the International Committee of Harmonization (ICH) 
Guideline.   
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  states  that  the  i.v  formulation  is  intended  for  use  as  a  temporary  replacement  for  oral 
administration  and  will  not  result  in  an  increase  in  environmental  exposure.  Therefore,  an 
environmental  risk  assessment  is  considered  not  necessary.  A  follow-up  measure  regarding  the 
environmental risk assessment of Revatio for oral administration is still running. Extra studies above 
the information as already requested for Revatio for oral administration are not necessary. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Three additional studies were provided for this extension application, which would already have been 
valuable  for  the  approval  of  Revatio  for  oral  use,  as  they  investigate  the  metabolism  of  sildenafil, 
either after oral or i.v. application.  The additional studies for this extension application did not contain 
information  on  the  comparison  in  plasma  (or  tissue)  kinetics  after  oral  and  i.v.  administration. 
However,  as  a  good  comparison  was  provided  between  oral  and  i.v.  administration  in  humans, 
additional animal studies are not required. The maximum plasma concentration and systemic exposure 
following  oral  administration  were  30%  and  41%,  respectively,  compared  to  i.v.  administration.  In 
addition,  based  on  the  discussion  provided  regarding  comparison  of  exposure  levels  for  unbound 
sildenafil  in  rat,  dog  and  human  from  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicity  studies,  there  is  no  reason  to 
expect  that  the  intravenous  administration    of  sildenafil    at  the  proposed  dose  of  10  mg  TID  would 
result in any new adverse effects in humans.  
In  all  species  studied,  sildenafil  is  metabolised  extensively.  Up  to  five  primary  metabolic  pathways 
were identified. In animals, qualitatively similar metabolic profiles were found as compared with man. 
UK-103,320 was present as a primary metabolite in plasma and excreta of all species examined. No 
significant human-specific metabolites were identified.  
The only noteworthy finding which was observed in a 1-month intravenous study in rats, compared to 
oral studies over the dose range 0.5-10 mg/kg was a slight increase in the incidence and severity of 
foci  of  myocardial  inflammation.  This  was  considered  not  relevant,  because  no  myocardial 
inflammation was observed in a study in which higher exposures were reached (oral 1-month study), 
and because there is no evidence that cGMP, of which the degradation is inhibited by sildenafil, acts 
as an inflammatory mediator. In dogs, no additional toxicity was observed in the i.v. studies compared 
to the oral studies that were conducted with sildenafil.

There was no evidence of treatment-induced irritation after a single intra-arterial injection in rabbits. 
Local  tolerance  was  also  studied  in  available  repeated  dose  studies  with  intravenous  administration. 
These  studies  showed  no  additional  intolerance  in  sildenafil-treated  injection  sites  compared  to  the 
control sites. 
Antigenicity  of  sildenafil  was  investigated  in  guinea  pigs  following  oral  or  subcutaneous 
administration.  No  evidence  of  antigenic  potential  was  observed.  Antigenic  potential  was  not 
investigated  following  intravenous  injection.  However,  if  no  antigenic  potential  was  observed  after 
subcutaneous injection, also no antigenic potential is expected following intravenous injection. 
1.4  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The following table shows the 7 studies conducted for the development programme for Revatio IV in 
healthy  volunteers  (Studies  A148-203,  A148-208  and  A148-215),  adult  patients  (Pivotal  study 
A1481024 and study A-148-301) and children (studies A1481134 and A1481157). Despite the MAH 
not  seeking  a  paediatric  indication,  these  2  last  studies  provided  additional  safety  data  for  the  IV 
formulation.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  was  investigated  in  the  original  sildenafil  male  erectile  dysfunction  (MED) 
development  programme (35 pharmacology studies). These studies examined the safety, tolerability,

PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), bioavailability, bioequivalence, effect of food and drug interactions of 
sildenafil, and PK characteristics in special patient populations.  
Three Phase 1 studies were conducted during the sildenafil citrate development programme to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics of IV sildenafil (studies A148-203, A148-208 and A148-215). The tables below 
give a summary of the pharmacokinetic variables for sildenafil and the main metabolite UK-103,320 
found in these studies.

Table 5.  Mean  UK-103,320  pharmacokinetic  variables 
administration of sildenafil  
in  healthy  volunteers  after 
intravenous 
In healthy volunteers, sildenafil citrate has been given as an IV infusion ranging in dose from 20 mg in 
40 mins to 80 mg in 40 mins. The mean Cmax achieved ranged from 331-1822 ng/mL, with a range in 
exposure (AUCt) of 714-3711 ng.h/ml. Tmax was similar for all doses studied. The pharmacokinetic 
variables  most  involved  in  the  assessment  of  the  dose  recommendation  for  IV  sildenafil,  volume  of 
distribution  at  steady  state  (Vss)  and  clearance  (CL)  demonstrated  ranges  of  57-105  l  and  26-41  l/h 
respectively. 
After i.v. administration of sildenafil a volume of distribution was found of about 105 l (study A148-
208). Partitioning of sildenafil and its metabolites into erythrocytes was found in vivo, resulting in a 
blood-to-plasma  ratio  of  about  1.6.  In  vitro  studies  with  human  plasma  showed  that  over  a 
concentration range from 0.01 - 10 µg/mL about 96% of sildenafil was bound to plasma proteins. Also 
the metabolite UK-103.320 was bound to plasma proteins for ca. 95%. No additional binding studies 
with specific proteins were carried out.  
The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil was determined after oral administration of a solution containing 
50 mg 14C-sildenafil and after an i.v. dose of 25 mg 14C-sildenafil to healthy male volunteers (study 
A148-215).  Three  volunteers  received  an  oral  solution  dose  of  50  mg  sildenafil  and  3  volunteers 
received 25 mg as an IV infusion in 50 mL over 25 min. Both dosage forms contained nominally 50 
μCi of [14C]-labeled sildenafil.  
Absorption  of  sildenafil  after  oral  administration  was  approximately  92%  whilst  the  oral 
bioavailability was 38%, this difference being due to extensive first pass metabolism. Geometric mean 
AUCt  values  indicated  that  sildenafil  accounted  for  approximately  60%  of  the  total  circulating 
radioactivity in the plasma after IV dosing and 32% after oral dosing. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For  the  main  metabolite  of  sildenafil  (UK-103,320),  the  geometric  mean  Cmax  value  following  IV 
dosing  was  7.3%  of  the  equivalent  parameter  for  sildenafil.  The  geometric  mean  AUCt  value  was 
14.4%  of  the  equivalent  parameter  for  the  parent  drug.  Following  oral  dosing,  the  geometric  mean 
Cmax value for UK-103,320 was 49% of that of the parent drug. The geometric mean AUCt value was 
54%  of  that  for  sildenafil.  Hence  the  amount  of  circulating  metabolite  was  significantly  lower 
following  IV  administration  versus  oral.  The  absolute  bioavailability  of  the  solution  was  about  38% 
which is in good agreement with the 41% obtained with the 50 mg capsule. The half-life of sildenafil 
tended  to  be  shorter  after  IV  administration  than  after  oral  administration,  2.18h  IV  vs.  3.19h, 
respectively. 
After i.v. and oral dosing of labelled sildenafil similar radioactivity was recovered in the faeces and 
urine, indicating that the bioavailability is about 100%. Thus the absolute bioavailability of about 40% 
is due to first pass metabolism and not due to incomplete absorption.

The  MAH  provided  a  justification  for  the  10  mg  intravenous  dose  based  on  calculations  and 
simulations  considering  the  higher  total  exposure  following  IV  than  the  oral  administration  together 
with  the  relative  potencies  of  the  parent/active  metabolite.  However,  this  justification  couldn’t  be 
applied  to  Cmax.  The  MAH  has  therefore  submitted  additional  PK  data  in  PAH  patients  receiving 
sildenafil administered as a bolus (study A1481262). These patients were previously on oral TID 20 
mg  sildenafil.  The  observed  concentration  time  curves  fit  well  within  the  predicted  curves  based  on 
population  PK  modelling.  The  population  PK  model  was  developed  based  on  earlier  performed  IV 
infusion,  IV  infusion/per  os  (PO)  cross-over  and  a  PO  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  model 
considered the known 30% lower clearance in PAH patients and the increased clearance (estimated 2.7 
times) due to co-administration of the CYP3A4 inducer bosentan.

As expected, total exposure and Cmax of parent sildenafil were higher after IV bolus administration 
than after oral administration of sildenafil 20 mg TID. However, total exposure and Cmax were lower 
than  after  80  mg  TID  sildenafil  oral  administration,  for  which  adequate  long-term  clinical  data  are 
available indicating that this dose is well tolerated.  
Discussion on Pharmacokinetics 
Drug  interactions  have  been  well  characterised  for  use  with  oral  Revatio  at  the  time  of  the  initial 
marketing  authorisation.  Theoretically,  any  PK  drug  interactions  with  other  drugs  after  IV 
administration of sildenafil should be less than that after oral administration as there is no first pass 
effect.  
The MAH provided an acceptable justification for the 10 mg intravenous dose based on calculations 
considering  the  higher  total  exposure  following  IV  than  the  oral  administration  together  with  the 
relative potencies of the parent/active metabolite and on PK data in PAH patients receiving sildenafil 
administered as a bolus. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As expected, total exposure and Cmax of parent sildenafil were higher after IV bolus administration 
than after oral administration of sildenafil 20 mg TID. However, total exposure and Cmax were lower 
than  after  80  mg  TID  sildenafil  oral  administration.  Individual  patients  may  experience  maximal 
sildenafil concentrations that are in the range observed with 80 mg TID oral administration. This could 
be associated with individual hypotensive cases observed (see safety discussion).  
Accumulation  after  TID  oral  dosing  is  limited.  Simulation  data  appropriately  demonstrate  that  no 
relevant accumulation is to be expected also after the intended IV bolus administration. Therefore, the 
lack of multiple dosing studies with an IV bolus administration is acceptable.  
PK data from the study A1481024 (see clinical efficacy) are very limited because only 1 plasma level 
was measured at the end of each infusion step. Observed plasma levels in patients with PH after IV 
administration were approximately 30% higher than those predicted from healthy volunteers.  
Assuming a similar exposure after 10 mg IV and 20 mg orally and as half-life tends to be shorter after 
IV administration than after oral administration, recommending a downward dose adjustment to 10 mg 
TID  after  a  careful  benefit-risk  assessment  and  only  if  therapy  is  not  well-tolerated  seem  to  be 
appropriate. No specific data for IV sildenafil are available in patients with hepatic impairment. Oral 
sildenafil  is  subject  to  an  important  first-pass  metabolism,  theoretically  resulting  in  higher  exposure 
than  after  IV  administration  at  “proportional”  doses  (20  mg  oral  vs.  10  mg  IV).  Therefore, 
recommending a downward dose adjustment to 10 mg TID after a careful benefit-risk assessment and 
only if therapy is not well-tolerated seem to be appropriate.  
Clinical efficacy  
Revatio 0.8 mg/ml solution for injection is intended for use in haemodynamically stable PAH patients 
who are currently undergoing treatment with oral Revatio but who are temporarily unable to take or 
tolerate oral medications. As such, the indicated population for Revatio IV is identical to that for oral 
Revatio. Since use of Revatio IV will involve the administration of the same therapeutic exposure to 
the same active ingredient in the same clinical population for treatment of the same medical condition, 
the MAH considered that there is no rationale for the expectation of a difference in efficacy following 
intravenous administration of Revatio.  
No new clinical studies were submitted. To support the efficacy of the IV formulation and the need for 
continuous  treatment,  the  MAH  referred  to  2  clinical  studies  submitted  in  the  initial  marketing 
authorisation application, Study A1481024 and Study A1481141, respectively.

Study A1481024 
Design 
This was a multi-centre trial to assess the safety, efficacy and toleration of intravenous (IV) sildenafil 
in  subjects  with  pulmonary  hypertension.  Patients  were  stratified  into  1  of  3  groups  prior  to 
randomisation according to type of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary arterial hypertension [primary 
and  secondary]  [Group  1a],  pulmonary  venous  hypertension  due  to  congestive  heart  failure  [Group 
1b],  and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension [Group 2]). (Only results of group 1a were presented and 
assessed in this application). 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the effect of intravenous (IV) sildenafil on some hemodynamic 
parameters in adults with pulmonary hypertension.  
Drug administration 
A  series  of  step-wise  IV  infusions  were  administered  targeting  concentrations  of  100,  300,  and  500 
ng/ml  in  the  ‘original  study’  and  10,  50,  and  100ng/ml  in  the  ‘extension  phase’.  Patients  with  PAH 
(group1a) subjects were randomised to receive either sildenafil or placebo (ratio 3:1). After the initial 
baseline assessment (Baseline 1) the indicated patients were administered 40ppm of NO by inhalation 
for  five  minutes.  When  the  value  of  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  (PAP)  returned  to  a  re-established 
baseline  (Baseline  2)  (±  5%  Baseline  1)  haemodynamic  measurements  were  conducted  followed  by 
the step infusion of study drug. The infusion was administered at a controlled rate to maintain plasma 
concentrations of 100, 300 and 500ng/ml consequtively in the original part of the protocol.  
The  haemodynamic  measurements  at  each  plasma  level  were  performed  after  10  minutes  of  every 
maintainance step of the infusion.

hypertension, including PAH. 
there 
Study A1481141 
Design 
This  was  a  multinational,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  parallel  group 
study. Eligible subjects were randomised to receive a subject optimised dose of sildenafil (20, 40 or 
80mg TID) plus epoprostenol or placebo TID plus epoprostenol in a 1:1 ratio. A total of 230 evaluable 
subjects  were  planned  in  the  protocol  (115  per  treatment  group).  The  study  comprised  a  screening 
visit, a 16-Week treatment period with visits at baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16, and a follow-up visit 
30 to 40 days after the last dose of study medication.  
Subjects aged ≥18 years with primary PAH or PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) 
or PAH associated with surgical repair were included. Subjects had to have been on epoprostenol for 
at  least  3  months,  and  been  on  an  estabilised,  “optimal”  dose  for  at  least  4  weeks  before 
randomisation.  Subjects  had  to  have  a  mean  pulmonary  artery  pressure  (mPAP)  ≥25mmHg  and  a 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≤15mmHg at rest via right heart catheterisation within 
21 days before randomisation, and a baseline 6-Minute Walk test distance ≥100m and ≤450m. 
Drug Administration 
Subjects randomised to sildenafil initially received sildenafil 20mg TID for 4 weeks. At the Week 4 
visit, they were up-titrated to 40mg TID for 4 weeks, and at the Week 8 visit they were up-titrated to 
80mg TID for 8 weeks. Subjects randomised to placebo underwent dummy up-titration at Weeks 4 and 
8.

Efficacy Evaluations 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Week 16 in the total distance walked 
during  the  6-Minute  Walk  test.  The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  the  change  from  baseline  at 
Week  16  in  mean  pulmonary  artery  pressure  (mPAP)  and  BORG  dyspnoea  score,  and  the  time  to 
clinical  worsening.  The  tertiary  endpoints  were  the  change  from  baseline  at  Week  16  in 
haemodynamic parameters and WHO Functional Class. 
Three  post-hoc  analyses  were  performed  on  the  efficacy  data,  the  relevant  one  to  the  current 
submission is presented here. Time to clinical worsening while on sildenafil 20mg was assessed post-
hoc by recording clinical worsening events up to the day of the Week 4 visit. It was from this day that 
sildenafil subjects were up-titrated from 20mg to 40mg (and placebo subjects underwent dummy up-
titration). If no event occurred time to event was censored from the day of the Week 4 visit. 
Results (Only results of the post-hoc analysis were presented) 
An  improvement  was  seen  as  early  as  the  Week  4  visit,  at  which  point  there  is  a  significant  (p  = 
0.0256)  difference  between  subjects  on  sildenafil  20  mg  TID  compared  to  placebo  on  the  clinical 
worsening endpoint (Table 13). The Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 4) show an early separation of the 
two treatments. This would suggest that the improvements in the time to clinical worsening are already 
evident  whilst  the  subjects  are  on  the  20  mg  dose.  Although  it  is  not  known  how  many  doses  of 
sildenafil can be missed before having an impact on time to clinical worsening current knowledge of 
the  progressive  nature  of  PAH  suggests  that  treatment  should  be  continuous.  Accordingly,  the 
availability  of  an  IV  formulation  that  provides  similar  plasma  exposure  to  20  mg  TID  doses  of 
sildenafil provides a further treatment option for physicians.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No new efficacy studies were submitted in this application. The rationale of the MAH is acceptable as 
no  need  is  foreseen  to  demonstrate  efficacy  separately  for  the  intravenous  formulation,  considering 
that  the  efficacy  of  Revatio  continuous  oral  administration  is  already  established  and  provided 
equivalent doses are given. The dose of 10 mg IV bolus was calculated taking into consideration the 
higher sildenafil but lower metabolite exposure following IV administration and the relative potencies 
of both, which can be acceptable.  
Study  A1481024  was  presented  in  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  as  part  of  the 
pharmacodynamic program. The results of this study demonstrated a positive hemodynamic effect for 
Revatio  on  the  pulmonary  vasculature.  Maximum  reductions  in  the  relevant  pulmonary  parameters 
pulmonary vascular resistance PVR and  pulmonary artery pressure mPAP appeared to be reached at 
plasma sildenafil concentrations of 100 ng/ml, while only limited reductions in mean systemic blood 
pressure  BP  were  observed  at  concentrations  below  100  ng/ml  in  patients  without  NO.  This  study 
indicated that plasma levels up to 100 ng/ml sildenafil appear to be an appropriate target with relative 
selectivity  to  the  pulmonary  circulation.  Based  on  the  PK  study  148-207  (original  Revatio 
submission),  the  mean  maximum  exposure  at  steady  state  of  sildenafil  following  20  mg  TID  was 
calculated  to  be  113  ng/ml  and  accordingly  this  dose  was  considered  clinically  relevant  for  further 
investigation in the pivotal study A1481140 (40 and 80 mg TID was also investigated). The results of 
the  pivotal  study  showed  a  significant  effect  for  sildenafil  20  mg  TID  on  exercise  capacity.  This 
efficacy can in turn be extrapolated to the IV administration as comparability in other PK parameters 
are currently shown.  
In order to emphasize the need for a  maintained  drug level, the MAH presented a post-hoc analysis 
from study A1481141.  Time to clinical worsening between placebo and sildenafil 20 mg was assessed 
by recording clinical worsening events up to the day of the Week 4 visit. An improvement was seen as 
early as the Week 4 visit, at which point there is a significant (p = 0.0256) difference between subjects 
on sildenafil 20 mg TID compared to placebo. The data should be regarded cautiously considering the 
post  hoc  nature  of  the  analysis.  Still,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  there  appears  to  be  some 
benefit  as  early  as  4  weeks  on  the  registered  dose  of  20  mg  TID  sildenafil  compared  to  placebo 
suggesting the need for continuous administration. Although no robust clinical evidence is presented 
to demonstrate actual deterioration in the patients’ conditions with temporary drug interruptions, it can 
be  agreed  that  generally  maintenance  of  adequate  blood  levels  is  a  rational  goal.    Accordingly,  the 
need to develop an IV formulation is acknowledged. 
Clinical safety 
The MAH provided safety data from the seven clinical studies as well as post marketing data and a 
literature review. Originally, the clinical development program for Revatio IV did not include any data 
regarding Sildenafil 10 mg bolus IV administration.  
At the request of the CHMP, in order to adequately assess the safety of the IV bolus administration, 
the  MAH  submitted  the  results  of  study  A1481262.  This  was  a  single-centre,  single  dose  (10  mg 
Revatio IV bolus), open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study. A total of 12 PAH subjects, already 
stable on oral Revatio 20 mg TID, were planned to complete the study. However, after recruiting 10 
subjects  and  analyzing  their  safety  data,  the  company  took  a  “  pragmatic”  decision  and  stopped 
recruitment as it was considered unlikely that their results would impact the general conclusions of the 
study. This approach would have been acceptable if the recruited numbers were large enough to allow 
for robust conclusion, which is not the case as will be shown below. The study design was considered 
acceptable.  
The actual diagnosis of most of the patients was not mentioned (one patient was listed with idiopathic 
PAH,  while  the  other  patients  had  a  general  diagnosis  of  PAH),  nor  their  WHO  function  class. 
However, 8/10 patients were on bosentan in addition to Revatio, signifying that they are possibly in 
severer  stages  necessitating  combination  therapy.  The  results  of  the  10  patients  showed  that  the 
administration of Revatio 10 mg bolus IV injection resulted in a maximum mean reduction of -9.4 ± 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11.66 mmHg  and  -3.0±4.93 mmHg  in  sitting  SBP  and  DBP  at  0.5  hours  and  1  hour  post  dose 
respectively. Maximum mean reduction of -6.1 ± 11.91 mmHg and -4.3 ± 6.29 mmHg standing SBP 
and DBP were recorded at 0.5 hour compared to pre-dose levels. 
Table 14. Changes from baseline in Systolic (sitting, standing and postural) and Diastolic (sitting, standing 
and postural) 
This was accompanied by only 3 mild AEs related to the drug. In one patient,  a change of the SBP of 
≥30  mmHg  was  recorded.  As  the  patient  was  originally  hypertensive  and  this  hypotension  was  not 
accompanied  by  symptoms  e.g  postural  hypotension  or  syncope,  the  MAH  considered  that  the  case 
would not fall into the category of excessive vasodilation. This explanation appeared plausible. 
The  results  are  reassuring,  but  it  is  difficult  to  draw  robust  conclusions  to  the  safety  of  Revatio  IV 
bolus  administration  as  the  number  of  recruited  patients  was  too  few  and  the  high  Cmax  may  be 
correlated  to  more  severe  BP  lowering  effects  as  seen  in  one  patient.    According  to  the  MAH,  no 
abnormal ECG tracings were recorded.  
The MAH also provided safety data from Revatio IV infusion in patients with PH (study: A1481024) 
ischemic heart disease patients (Study: 148301), post-operative PH pediatric patients (A1481134) or 
PPHN patients (A1481157) or healthy volunteer studies (Studies: 148203-148208 and 148215).  
The most relevant of these safety data are considered to originate from study A1481024. A subgroup 
of  35  PAH  is  the  focus  of  this  report.  In  study  A1481024,  sildenafil  was  administered  in  35  PAH 
patients (other subtypes of PH recruited in this study are not described in the current assessment) as a 
series of step-wise IV infusions targeting 300 ng and 500 ng/ml in the original study and 10, 50 and 
100 ng/ml in the extension phase. 
The reported adverse events were generally comparable to the adverse events reported to the pivotal 
study A1481140 where sildenafil was orally administered, although the number of events are too few 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to allow for proper conclusions. The relation of the reported AE to the plasma concentration was not 
reported.  None  of  the  reported  serious  adverse  events  or  the  one  case  of  death  were  considered 
treatment  related.  Regarding  systemic  blood  pressure  measurements,  as  could  be  expected,  the 
administered Sildenafil IV infusions appear to have resulted in systemic reductions in blood pressure. 
These  were  generally  tolerated,  however,  in  some  cases  this  led  to  study  discontinuation  (1  case 
reported as AE; 6 other cases because of protocol definitions). 
Based on the whole A1481024 population, no clinically significant laboratory findings were noticed. 
Two cases of discontinuations due to adverse events related to sildenafil administration were reported 
in  the  PAH  subgroup,  one  case  of  nausea  and  one  case  of  hypotension.  In  the  reported  case  of 
hypotension,  no  clinical  symptoms  as  a  result  of  the  drop  in  systemic  pressure  were  observed.  The 
severity was considered mild, and no action other than stopping the sildenafil infusion was taken. The 
safety  results  of  study  A1481024  generally  support  that  Sildenafil  IV  infusions  achieving  plasma 
levels up to 500 ng/ml were well tolerated. This is reassuring considering that the predicted upper 90% 
CI of Cmax for the commercial 10 mg IV bolus is not expected to exceed 300 ng/mL.  
In patients with stable ischemic heart diseases (study 148301), doses of Sildenafil 40 mg IV infusion 
appeared  to  be  well  tolerated,  though  the  numbers  (n=8)  are  too  few  to  allow  for  any  robust 
conclusions. 
The reported cases (n=3) in the post marketing experience involve un-registered use of Sildenafil (2 
cases  of  paediatric  use  and  one  case  dissolving  Viagra  tablets  and  injecting  them).  For  the 
compassionate use, no details were supplied by the MAH precluding any assessment. 
In the three healthy volunteer studies A148-203, A148-208 and A148-215 (n= 23), the administered 
doses varied between 20 mg to 80 mg Sildenafil IV infusion. Generally, the reported adverse events 
following IV infusion were comparable to those reported after oral administration, mostly related to 
vasodilation.  
The MAH submitted data from the paediatric studies A1481134 and A1481157 in which pulmonary 
hypertension paediatric patients were administered sildenafil IV during the post-operative period after 
corrective  cardiac  surgery  or  Persistent  Pulmonary  Hypertension  of  Neonates  PPHN  patients, 
respectively. As Sildenafil is not authorised for paediatric use and the administered dose is accordingly 
not properly assessed, the submitted information was not considered relevant to this application. 
The MAH also presented a literature review including 10 clinical studies spanning many indications, 
patient  populations  and  dose  ranges.    The  majority  of  the  studies  used  short  infusions  ranging  from 
0.025 mg/kg over 10 minutes to 0.3 mg/kg/min for 14 days in infants and 300 mcg over 6 minutes to 
60 mg over an hour in adults. No special safety issues were specifically identified, but no conclusions 
can be made considering the different route of administration. The study of Alp et al. (2006) deserves 
special attention as it is the only study in which sildenafil was administered as an IV bolus. A dose of 
12.5 mg followed by 37.5 mg was administered in 6 PH patients secondary to COPD. The dose was 
well  tolerated  and  the  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  PVR  was  more  markedly  reduced  than  the 
systemic  vascular  resistance  SVR  even  after  12  hours  of  administration.  The  results  are  generally 
supportive considering that the administered dose is 5 times the currently recommended dose. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The  anticipated  safety  issues  from  the  bolus  injection  of  a  vasodilator  drug  are  mainly  related  to 
hypotension.  Results  of  study  A1481262  did  not  identify  serious  safety  issues  following  the 
administration  of  Revatio  IV  10  mg  bolus  dose  in  the  10  patients  studied.  However,  the  safety 
database  is  too  limited  to  allow  robust  conclusions.  The  MAH  will  introduce  a  targeted 
pharmacovigilance surveillance programme to capture events of hypotension and associated problems.  
In addition, Line listing for IV patients will be provided every 6 months and a PSUR as per the normal 
schedule.  If  warranted,  new  safety  information  from  the  line  listings  may  trigger  the  restart  of  the 
regular PSUR periodicity.  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP was concerned about the proposed vial size of 40 mg in 50 ml, when the recommended 
dose  per  administration  is  10  mg  with  each  administration  requiring  a  new  vial,  as  this  would  be  a 
potential  for  medication  errors.  The  MAH  committed  to  develop  a  20  ml  presentation  containing  a 
nominal  fill  volume  of  12.5 ml  (10 mg)  by  May  2010.  Until  this  new  presentation  is  available,  a 
controlled  distribution  system  and  an  educational  program  are  proposed  to  alert  the  health 
professionals about the potential risk related to the vial size.  
1.5  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
A  pharmacovigilance  system  document  (version  2.0)  has  recently  been  submitted  and  assessed 
(EMEA/H/C/638/II/23,  Commission  Decision  on  3  August  2009),  and  it  is  concluded  that  the 
pharmacovigilance system as described by the MAH is of good quality and is in line with section 2.2 
of the Volume 9A of “The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union”. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  MAH  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
The MAH submitted a new version of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), which includes updated 
sections related to this new application for intravenous administration. This RMP included a risk 
minimisation plan. 
As  indicated  in  the  discussion  above,  the  current  safety  data  cannot  substitute  the  need  to  exclude 
safety  issues  mainly  related  to  vasodilatation  following  the  bolus  administration.  A  targeted 
pharmovigilance programme should be agreed before launch to that effect. 
In addition, Revatio 0.8 mg/ml solution for injection will be available as a clear solution for injection 
in a 50  ml single use vial containing 40  mg of  sildenafil (i.e. 0.8mg/ml). The  recommended dose is 
10mg  (corresponding  to  12.5  ml),  administered  three  times  a  day.  The  vial  should  not  be  used  as  a 
multidose  product  since  there  is  no  preservative  in  the  formulation.  After  each  intravenous 
administration, the non-utilized content of the vial should be discarded with the vial.  
Therefore, until a 20 ml presentation containing a nominal fill volume of 12.5 ml (10 mg) is available, 
there  is  the  potential  for  medication  errors,  through  the  use  of  doses  greater  than  the  recommended 
dose being administered to patients, and through the potential for a single vial to be used more than 
once  for  the  same  or  different  recipients.  It  was  therefore  agreed  that  additional  risk  minimisation 
activities (controlled distribution system and educational pack) would be implemented to that effect.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  MA  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal 
product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report. 
1.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Revatio 0.8 mg/ml solution for injection was proposed for PAH patients who may find themselves in 
clinical  settings  where  they  are  temporarily  unable  to  take  oral  medications  or  unable  to  absorb 
medications  enterally.  Although  no  robust  clinical  evidence  is  presented  to  demonstrate  actual 
deterioration  in  the  patients’  conditions  with  temporary  drug  interruptions,  it  can  be  agreed  that 
maintenance  of  adequate  blood  levels  is  a  rational  goal.    Accordingly,  the  need  to  develop  an  IV 
formulation is acknowledged. 
The  quality  of  the  solution  for  injection  has  been  adequately  described.  The  excipients  used  in  the 
preparation of the product and the manufacturing process selected are appropriate. The drug product 
can  be  reproducibly  manufactured  and  therefore  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance in clinic. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were some minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  submitted  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and 
committed  to  resolve  these  issues  as  Follow-Up  Measures  after  the  opinion,  within  an  agreed 
timeframe. 
No new efficacy studies were submitted in this application. This is acceptable as no need is foreseen to 
demonstrate  efficacy  separately  for  the  intravenous  formulation  as  the  efficacy  of  Revatio  for  oral 
administration  is  already  established  provided  equivalent  doses  are  given.  The  need  to  maintain 
therapeutic drug concentrations is also rational. Based on the submitted PK data, the proposed dose of 
10 mg IV bolus is acceptable.  
Limited safety data specific to sildenafil 10 mg IV bolus dose is currently available. No serious safety 
concerns were identified, though the numbers are too limited to allow robust conclusions. Supportive 
data from sildenafil IV infusion administration was also submitted.  Doses of 20 to 80 mg sildenafil IV 
infusion appear to have been well tolerated.  
The  proposed  vial  size  is  of  concern  as  this  would  be  a  potential  for  medication  errors.  The  MAH 
committed  to  develop  a  20  ml  presentation  containing  a  nominal  fill  volume  of  12.5 ml  (10 mg)  by 
May 2010. Until this new presentation is available, a controlled distribution system and an educational 
program are proposed to alert the health professionals about the potential risk related to the vial size.  
In summary, there may be a need to develop a parenteral route of administration, to ensure continuous 
adequate levels of sildenafil in cases when oral intake is not possible or inadequate. Efficacy following 
sildenafil IV bolus administration is expected to be comparable to that following oral administration. 
Safety data do not identify serious adverse events associated with this IV bolus administration, though 
the  data  is  too  limited.  A  targeted  pharmacovigilance  surveillance  programme  to  capture  events  of 
hypotension and associated problems will be introduced.  
The MAH conducted a user consultation for the package leaflet of the Revatio 0.8 mg/ml solution for 
injection. The Readability has been tested adequately.

Changes  related  to  the  QRD  review  of  the  Revatio  0.8  mg/ml  solution  for  injection  product 
information were also implemented to the Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablets, where applicable.  
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Revatio 0.8mg/ml solution for injection, for the treatment of 
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who are currently prescribed oral Revatio and who are 
temporarily unable to take oral medicine, but are otherwise clinically and haemodynamically stable. 
Revatio (oral) is indicated for treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as 
WHO  functional  class  II  and  III,  to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  primary 
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease, 
was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  of  this  new 
strength, new pharmaceutical form and new route of administration.

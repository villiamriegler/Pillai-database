2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a group of uncommon and heterogeneous malignant 
lymphoproliferative disorders that originate from post-thymic (peripheral) T cells or mature natural 
killer (NK) cells, which according to the recent (2016) WHO classification are recognized as separate 
entities.   
The originally acclaimed indication was: ADCETRIS in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated CD30+ 
peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). 
Following the assessment, the final agreed indication was: ADCETRIS in combination with 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (CHP) is indicated for adult patients with previously 
untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 
Epidemiology   
PTCL is a very rare condition with an estimated incidence of < 1 case per 100,000 people, which 
represent 10%–15% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The male/female ratio is 2:1 and the median 
age at diagnosis is between 50 and 70 years but may vary between subtypes (e.g. for hepatosplenic T 
cell lymphoma (HSTCL) the median age is 34 years). The most frequent occurring PTCL entities in the 
EU are (Vose 2008): 
Peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), 34.3%; 
• 
•  Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), 28.7%, this subtype is associated with infection by 
the HTL virus, type I; 
•  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, primary systemic type (sALCL); ALK- 9.4%, ALK+ 6.4%. This 
subtype has a CD30 cell expression of ≥75% per definition;  
• 
Enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), 9.1%. EATL is seen in patients with untreated 
celiac disease. 
The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is the most commonly used prognostic tool in nodal PTCL 
(PTCL-NOS, AITL and ALCL). 
Biologic features  
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a group of heterogeneous malignant lymphoproliferative 
disorders that originate from post-thymic T cells or mature natural killer (NK) cells. Taking into account 
the differences in disease biology the WHO 2016 classifies these disorders as separate disease entities.

Figure 1 PTCL classification 
CD30 - a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily- is expressed on a small subset of 
activated T and B lymphocytes, and a variety of lymphoid neoplasms, with the highest expression in 
classical HL and ALCL (ALCL is defined by CD30 cell expression of 75% or higher). CD30 expression in 
various intensity has also been described in more than half of the patients with PTCL-NOS, AITL, 
ENKTL (not included in study), EATL and ATLL (Bossard 2014, Weyden 2017).  
Table 1. Immunohistochemical CD30 expression in PTCL subtypes (Bossard 2014) 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most patients with PTCL present with generalized lymphadenopathy, and the skin and gastrointestinal 
tract are the most commonly involved extranodal sites. Infiltration of bone marrow, liver and/or spleen 
may be seen. Symptoms such as B-symptoms, eosinophilia, pruritus, haemophagocytosis, 
thrombocytopenia and anemia may be observed. 
Diagnosis and classification are made based on histology, immunophenotype, molecular genetic data

and clinical data.  
The prognosis of PTCL is highly dependent on subtype and IPI score, see Table 2. The subtype ALCL 
ALK+  (5 year OS 70%) usually has a better prognosis compared to the other subtypes. Also, ALK− 
ALCL (5 year OS 49%) appears to be have a better prognosis than that reported for PTCL-NOS and 
AITL (both 5 year OS 32%). EATL has a poor prognosis (5 year OS 20%). ATLL prognosis (5 year OS 
14%) is dependent on the clinical variant, ranging from very poor prognosis (several months) to 
sometimes quite indolent. HSTCL has one of the worst prognoses among PTCLs with 5-year OS rates of 
less than 10%.  
In summary, there is an unmet need in PTCL due to the toxicity of the regimens used for treatment 
and due to the low long-term survival rates in most PTCL subtypes. 
Table 2. PTCL subtype survival by histologic type and IPI (Vose 2008) 
Management 
The treatment of newly diagnosed PTCL patients depends on subtype, age, IPI and comorbidities. Most 
PTCL patients are treated in a trial. Outside of a trial the following is advised (subtypes limited to those 
included in the pivotal study): 
•  Nodal PTCL (PTCL-NOS, AITL and ALCL): The combination of Cyclophosphamide, 
Hydroxydaunorubcin, Oncovin (vincristine) and prednisone (CHOP) is the most commonly used 
regimen. For fit patients ≤60 years CHOEP (i.e. CHOP plus etoposide) is recommended, as 
population-based studies indicate that CHOEP gives an EFS benefit compared to CHOP, but no OS 
benefit has been shown. Based on level III evidence autologous SCT is advised in fit patients (most 
beneficial in first CR relative to second or subsequent CR or PR). The few patients with truly 
localized disease should receive a shortened chemotherapy schedule followed by local 
radiotherapy. In low-risk (IPI 0-2) ALCL ALK+ patients, consolidation with autologous stem cell 
transplantation (auto-SCT) is not recommended due to the favourable prognosis at baseline. 
• 
Extranodal PTCL: 
o  EATL: This subtype has poor outcomes on CHOP and more intensive regimens are 
recommended (e.g. IVE/MTX, CHOEP 14). Fit patients who achieve first remission may 
benefit from autoSCT. 
o  HSTCL: There are limited data available on the treatment of this subtype, but intense 
regimens such as ICE, IVAC or dose-dense CHOEP/EPOCH have been proposed. AutoSCT 
consolidation in fit patients is recommended, since it may offer the only chance for durable 
Assessment report

Page 11/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remission. 
•  Widespread PTCL: 
o  ATLL: Therapy is usually offered to patients with acute, lymphoma-type, or unfavourable 
chronic type. It is unclear what the best treatment for ATLL is, but VCAP-AMP-VECP has 
been proposed. 
Response duration of first line therapy is often short and relapses are frequent. There is no standard of 
care for r/r PTCL besides brentuximab vedotin for r/r ALCL patients. Furthermore, it is currently 
recommended that fit patients who respond to therapy (preferably in first CR) should proceed to 
autologous SCT, as response duration upon first line therapy is often modest and relapses are 
frequent. For patients not able to proceed to SCT, responses to subsequent therapy are often of short 
duration.  
A treatment bridging to transplant could be offered but not all patients may be fit enough to undergo 
this. For these patients, responses to subsequent therapy are often of modest duration. 
Subtypes excluded from the study 
Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is the 6th most common subtype in the EU. This subtype has 
been described to express CD30. Treatment has shown promising results on L-asparaginase containing 
regimens. Radiotherapy can be added in case of stage I-II (usually nasal) disease. Stage III-IV 
patients should proceed to autoSCT if CR is reached.  Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma 
is a very rare entity often presenting with an associated haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). Patients 
with the alpha/beta variant have more indolent disease, patients with the gamma/delta variant have 
poor prognosis and should be treated with aggressive, anthracycline-based chemotherapy. 
There is an unmet need in PTCL due to the low long-term survival rates in all PTCL entities and the 
toxicity of the treatment regimens. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the monoclonal 
antibody (cAC10) covalently linked, via an enzyme-cleavable linker, to the antimitotic small molecule 
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Binding of the ADC to CD30 on the cell surface initiates 
internalisation of the ADC-CD30 complex, which then traffics to the lysosomal compartment. Within 
the cell MMAE is released via proteolytic cleavage and degradation of the drug linker. Binding of MMAE 
to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, induces cell cycle arrest and results in 
apoptotic death of the CD30-expressing tumour cell.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance / 
scientific advice 
The development programme was discussed with the CHMP in the context of Scientific Advice / 
protocol Assistance procedures, (see above) regarding the proposed study population, the 
appropriateness of the  control arm; the primary endpoint PFS and secondary endpoints, sample size 
calculation, the possibility of unblinding at time of documented progression; considerations on the HR 
assumption. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020

CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided an updated ERA. 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components: 
1) the chimeric antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, 2) the antimicrotubule agent 
monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), and 3) a protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to 
cAC10. cAC10 has a structure typical of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass. Estimated 
PECsurface water is 3.69 ng L-1. A refined Fpen (4.1×10-5) was used to calculate this PEC, based on a worst-
case combined incidence rate of 8.8×10-4 for the following four indications: Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), 
systemic Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and Peripheral 
T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The incidence rates for HL, sALCL and CTCL were published in EMA/COMP 
public summaries of opinion (PSO) on orphan designation for brentuximab vedotin. The incidence rate 
for PTCL originates from the current application and corresponds to incidence rates for PTCL as cited in 
the Orphan Designation PSO's for other active substances (e.g. EMA/694349/2017). Further, a worst-
case dose estimation and a full one year prescribed treatment regime were assumed to calculate the 
cited Fpen. 
The size of the molecule (molecular weight estimated at 153,352 Da) excludes bioaccumulation. A 
determination of log Kow of this substance has not been performed and is not needed. The PBT 
assessment is therefore concluded. Brentuximab vedotin is not PBT, nor vPvB.

In support of the current application, PK results from the ECHELON-2 study, with brentuximab given in 
combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, were submitted. This section of the 
assessment report summarizes PK findings from this ECHELON-2 study. ECHELON-2 was a 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, multicentre, phase 3 study in patients 
with previously untreated, CD30+ peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) designed with the primary 
objective of comparing the PFS obtained with A+CHP versus that obtained with CHOP for frontline 
treatment of PTCL.

In the ECHELON-2 study, PK and anti-therapeutic antibody (ADA) assessments were performed for all 
patients who received brentuximab vedotin, and exposure-effect analyses were applied to evaluate 
select safety and efficacy outcomes. 
In Study ECHELON-2, patients were randomized 1:1 into 1 of 2 treatment arms: 
A+CHP consists of: 
•  A: Brentuximab vedotin: 1.8 mg/kg administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
•  C: Cyclophosphamide: 750 mg/m2 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
•  H: Doxorubicin: 50 mg/m2 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
• 
P: Prednisone: 100 mg PO daily on Days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle. 
CHOP consists of: 
•  C: Cyclophosphamide: 750 mg/m2 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
•  H: Doxorubicin: 50 mg/m2 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
•  O: Vincristine: 1.4 mg/m2 (dose capped at 2 mg) was administered by IV on Day 1 of each 
21-day cycle. 
• 
P: Prednisone: 100 mg PO daily on Days 1-5 of each 21-day cycle. 
In each 21-day cycle, patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine or placebo for 
vincristine in the stated order and according to institutional standards on Day 1; prednisone was 
administered by mouth on Days 1-5. Brentuximab vedotin IV infusion or placebo for brentuximab 
vedotin was administered on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle within 1 hour of completing treatment with 
other agents administered IV. In the absence of infusion-related reactions, brentuximab vedotin was to 
be administered as a 30-minute infusion. 
Methods 
Sparse PK and immunogenicity measurements were made in all brentuximab vedotin-treated patients 
(A+CHP) for the determination of serum concentrations of ADC, plasma concentrations of MMAE, ADA 
and neutralizing anti-therapeutic antibodies (nADA) (Table 4). 
Table 4. Study SGN35-014 (ECHELON-2): PK and immunogenicity sampling timepoints  
Serum concentrations of ADC were quantified using a previously validated sandwich enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and plasma samples were analysed for MMAE using a 
previously validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method.  
Assessment report

Page 15/105 
 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics, including number of patients, mean, standard deviation, geometric mean, 
percent coefficient of variation (%CV), median, minimum, and maximum were used to summarize 
concentrations of analyte for the patients who received brentuximab vedotin. In addition, exploratory 
exposure-response analyses of ADC and MMAE were performed and are described under section 2.3.4 
(PK/PD modelling). 
Immunogenicity assessment 
Immunogenicity assessments to evaluate anti-therapeutic antibodies (ADA) and neutralising ADA were 
performed only for patients who received at least 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin. Blood samples were 
collected before administration of the study drugs at Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4, and at end 
of treatment (EOT) as depicted in Table 4. 
The assessment of ADA was determined using a previously validated electrochemiluminescence assay. 
The assessment for nADA was performed for ADA-positive samples only using a previously validated 
ELISA-based nADA assay.  
PK Parameters for Brentuximab Vedotin ADC and MMAE in PTCL patients from the ECHELON-
2 study 
Summary statistics of ADC serum concentrations following IV administration of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab 
vedotin Q3W in the A+CHP arm (as compared to those obtained in the ALCANZA (Study C25001), 
applying a 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab dose as single agent in patients with CTCL) are presented below.  
Three out of 217 evaluable patients had measurable serum ADC concentrations in the predose sample 
at C1D1 and one out of 218 evaluable patients had measurable plasma MMAE concentrations in the 
predose sample at C1D1.

concentrations 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 16/105 
 
 
 
 
The geometric mean (%CV) serum ADC trough concentrations after Cycle 3 (C4D1 predose) through 
Cycle 8 (C8D1 predose) were consistent over time and ranged from 0.83 μg/mL (47%) to 0.92 μg/mL 
(43%-47%) (data not shown in table). The geometric mean (%CV) plasma MMAE trough 
concentrations after Cycle 3 (C4D1 predose) up to Cycle 8 (C8D1 predose) were consistent over time 
and ranged from 0.08 ng/mL (46%) to 0.10 ng/mL (78-84%) (data not shown in table). Steady state 
therefore is assumed to be present at C4D1. 
Overall, PK parameter estimates for Concentration at end of infusion (Ceoi), maximum concentration 
(Cmax) and trough plasma drug concentration (Ctrough) appeared comparable between the ECHELON-2 
and ALCANZA studies for both ADC and MMAE. 
Additionally, as part of the submission of the ALCANZA study (EMEA/H/C/002455/II/048), a population 
PK meta-analysis was conducted that integrated brentuximab vedotin monotherapy PK data from 380 
patients with CD30+ haematological malignancies and included 58 patients with relapsed/refractory 
ALCL from Study SG035-004. The results of that analysis indicated there were no clinically meaningful 
differences in brentuximab vedotin PK across the tumour types evaluated (HL, sALCL, mycosis 
fungoides, primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or non-specified haematological 
malignancies).  
Collectively, these results support the findings that the serum and plasma PK characteristics of ADC 
and MMAE, respectively, following administration of brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone were similar to PK characteristics of monotherapy. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No data was provided on the effect of brentuximab on the PK of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone, which were co-administered with brentuximab in the ECHELON-2 study.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No new data on the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new data on primary and secondary pharmacology were submitted. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
An exploratory analysis was conducted in the ECHELON-2 study for brentuximab vedotin ADC and 
MMAE to examine exposure-response relationships. Only data from ECHELON-2 were used in this 
evaluation. 
The objectives of this exposure-response analysis were: 
• 
• 
To assess relationships between steady-state trough ADC concentrations and Progression free 
survival (PFS) as evaluated by an independent review facility (IRF). 
To assess relationships between steady-state trough ADC and MMAE concentrations and the 
following AEs: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 17/105 
 
 
 
-  Grade 4 or higher neutropenia. 
- 
Febrile neutropenia. 
-  Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy. 
-  Any Grade 3 or higher TEAE. 
Exposure-Efficacy relationship 
An analysis was conducted to determine if PFS was balanced across quartiles of steady-state ADC 
serum trough concentrations on the A+CHP arm.  
Figure 2 presents Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS per IRF versus days of treatment. ADC serum trough 
concentration values on C4D1 predose were grouped by quartiles and a separate curve for the CHOP 
arm is provided as a reference.  
Figure 2. Study SGN35-014: Kaplan-Meier Plots for PFS per IRF by Quartiles of ADC Trough 
Concentration (ECHELON-2 study) 
No meaningful differences were observed between the curves for PFS per IRF by increasing quartiles of 
ADC trough concentrations, the quartiles do not order by quartile rank, and are separated from the 
PFS curve for the CHOP arm. The frequency of PFS events appears to be balanced across quartiles of 
ADC trough concentrations.

Exposure-Safety relationship 
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy 
was evaluated by quartiles of ADC serum or MMAE plasma steady-state trough concentrations for 
evaluable patients in the A+CHP arm. There was no apparent trend between steady-state trough 
(C4D1 predose) ADC concentrations and the incidence of any Grade 3 or higher TEAE, Grade 4 or 
higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy (Table 6).  
Table 6. Study SGN35-014 (ECHELON-2): incidence of TEAEs of interest by quartiles of ADC 
trough concentration 
Steady-state MMAE trough concentrations did not appear to be associated with the incidence of Grade 
2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, whereas there appeared to be a trend between quartiles of steady-
state trough MMAE concentrations and the incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, Grade 4 or higher 
neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia (Table 7), with the observed incidence of these events being 
numerically greater in the third and fourth quartile compared to the first or second quartile of steady-
state trough MMAE concentrations.

MMAE trough concentration 
Immunogenicity Results 
The electrochemiluminescent assay used to detect antitherapeutic antibodies in the ECHELON-2 study 
samples had a drug tolerance of up to 12.5 μg/mL brentuximab vedotin for a 100 ng/mL positive 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 19/105 
 
 
 
 
 
antibody control and up to 25 μg/mL brentuximab vedotin for 250 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL positive 
antibody controls. 
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based immunoassay (ELISA) method for the determination of 
neutralizing antibodies (nATA) had a drug tolerance of up to 5 μg/mL brentuximab vedotin for a 250 
ng/mL positive antibody control. In the A+CHP arm, baseline ATA samples were available for 205 of 
226 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population; samples were missing for 18 patients, and 3 
patients did not receive study treatment. The majority of patients were ATA-negative at baseline 
(81%) and most remained ATA negative throughout postbaseline visits. 
A total of 49 of 205 patients (24%) were confirmed positive for ATA at any postbaseline visit; 40 
patients who tested ATA negative at baseline and 9 patients who were confirmed ATA positive at 
baseline. Of the 49 ATA-positive patients, 47 patients (96%) were transiently ATA positive, and 2 
patients (4%) were persistently ATA positive. The majority of ATA-positive patients first had a 
confirmed positive result at Cycle 2. The rate of ADA positive patients in the pivotal ECHELON-2 trial 
lies within the range of previous studies. 
The PK of ADC did not appear to be altered in persistently ATA-positive patients. 
Five patients on the A+CHP arm tested positive for nATA to brentuximab vedotin. The PK of ADC did 
not appear to be altered in nATA-positive patients. Four of the 5 patients first tested positive for nATA 
at Cycle 2; the other patient first tested positive at Cycle 3. All 5 patients had an objective response, 
although 2 of the 5 patients subsequently experienced disease progression. 
No notable differences were observed between the PFS-independent review facility (IRF) curves or 
incidence of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) for ATA-negative and ATA-positive patients. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In support of the current application, PK results from the ECHELON-2 study, with brentuximab given in 
combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, were submitted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 20/105 
 
 
 
 
In this respect, the PK of the brentuximab antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and its MMAE part were 
assessed, based on sparse sampling during the study. Overall, ADC and MMAE PK parameter estimates 
for the concentration at the end of infusion (Ceoi), maximum concentration (Cmax) and trough plasma 
drug concentration (Ctrough) over time appeared comparable between the ECHELON-2 and ALCANZA 
(the latter with brentuximab given as single agent) studies for both ADC and MMAE. Steady state is 
assumed to be present at C4D1. 
After multiple-dose IV infusion of 1.8 mg/kg ADCETRIS every 3 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of ADC 
and MMAE were similar to those of monotherapy. 
Based on product characteristics and in vitro data, brentuximab vedotin is not expected to affect the 
PK of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone, or vice versa.  
The rate of ADA positive patients in the pivotal ECHELON-2 trial lies within the range of previous 
studies. Therefore, maintaining the current wording on immunogenicity in the SmPC is considered 
acceptable.  
As regards to the exposure-efficacy analysis, no meaningful differences were observed between the 
curves for PFS per IRF by increasing quartiles of ADC trough concentrations. As seen in the K-M graph 
patients in the A+CHP arm displayed consistent treatment benefit based on PFS across all quartiles of 
brentuximab vedotin exposure. The Kaplan-Meier plots did not rank order by quartiles of ADC trough 
concentration, tended to overlap and were separated from the PFS curve for the CHOP arm. 
OS curves per Quartile of exposure to ADC are largely overlapping regardless of AUC. For PFS these 
results are not as homogenous. Nevertheless, the provided data show that reduced doses are not 
necessarily negatively impacting efficacy outcomes. With respect to the exposure-safety analysis, 
steady-state ADC trough concentrations did not appear to be associated with the incidence of Grade 3 
or higher TEAEs, Grade 4 or higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or Grade 2 or higher peripheral 
neuropathy. Likewise, steady-state MMAE trough concentrations did not appear to be associated with 
the incidence of Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, whereas there appeared to be a trend 
between MMAE trough concentrations and the incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, Grade 4 or higher 
neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia. These results are also consistent with previously observed 
exposure-safety relationships for brentuximab vedotin monotherapy (r/r CTCL; ALCANZA) and in 
combination with chemotherapy (ECHELON-1). Additional exposure-safety analyses indicated that 
time-averaged MMAE exposure (MMAE AUC/Time) was significantly related to the incidence of Grade 4 
neutropenia (p=0.006), febrile neutropenia (p<0.0001) and ≥Grade 3 TEAE(p<0.0001). ADC 
AUC/Time and Cycle were statistically significant predictors of the incidence of ≥Grade 2 or higher 
peripheral neuropathy (p=0.034).  
In ALCANZA, the relationship between brentuximab vedotin exposure and Grade 3 or higher TEAEs and 
Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy was evaluated. In that study, ADC exposure was found to be 
a predictor of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs. In ECHELON-1, the relationship between brentuximab vedotin 
exposure and Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, Grade 4 or higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and Grade 
2 or higher peripheral neuropathy was evaluated; ADC exposure was found to be a predictor of febrile 
neutropenia and Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy. In ECHELON-1, like in ECHELON-2, MMAE 
exposure was found to be a predictor of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, Grade 4 or higher neutropenia, and 
febrile neutropenia. MMAE Cmax levels versus change in neutrophil count did not reveal a clear 
correlation. 
For patients experiencing treatment-related toxicities at the starting dose, protocol-specified dose 
reductions for brentuximab vedotin were recommended as supported by exposure-safety analyses that 
revealed relationships between MMAE exposure and the incidence of all evaluated AE outcomes of 
clinical interest (Grade 4 or higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and Grade 3 or higher TEAEs).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 21/105 
 
 
 
Collectively, these results support the findings that the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin can be 
adequately managed by the dose modification/dose reduction criteria established in ECHELON-2. 
Additional analyses indicated that the PTCL disease type had no clinically meaningful impact on the 
exposure-safety relationships. Differences in safety profiles observed across the PTCL subtypes, and 
thus the actual exposure-safety analyses for the largest PTCL disease types studied (sALCL, PTCL-NOS 
and AITL) were mainly attributed to differences in age among patients in the diseases studied (see 
also discussion on Clinical Safety). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP were evaluated in a single phase 3 study 
in 223 patients (SGN35-014/ECHELON-2). After multiple-dose IV infusion of 1.8 mg/kg ADCETRIS 
every 3 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE were similar to those of monotherapy. Overall, 
provided PK and exposure-response data support the current application for the extension of indication 
for Adcetris.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
 The approved dose for brentuximab vedotin monotherapy is 1.8 mg/kg IV administered every 3 weeks 
(Q3W). This was the MTD in a phase 1, dose-escalation study (SG035-0001), and evaluated in 2 phase 
2 studies (SG035-0003 and -0004) in subjects with CD30-positive hematologic malignancies. 
SGN35-011 is a phase 1 dose finding study of brentuximab vedotin (BV) administered 
sequentially/concurrently with multi-agent chemotherapy in treatment-naive patients with CD30+ 
mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms. This study consisted of 3 arms; in part 1 only sALCL patients 
were included. 
• 
• 
• 
Part 1, arm 1: This arm aimed to evaluate safety and tumor activity of BV 1.8mg/kg Q3W in cycle 
(C)1 and C2, followed by CHOP in C3-C8, followed by BV in C9-16 for responders. 
Part 1, arm 2: This arm aimed to evaluate the MTD of BV (1.8 mg/kg Q3W, in case of ≥2 of 6 DLTs 
in C1 dose was to be de-escalated to 1.2mg/kg) + CHP in C1-6 followed by BV 1.8mg/kg in C7-16 
for responders. DLTs were defined as any Cycle 1 toxicity requiring a dose delay of ≥7 days in CHP 
therapy. 
Part 2, arm 3: This arm aimed to evaluate the BV MTD in combination with CHP for up to 6 cycles 
followed by BV 1.8 mg/kg in C9-16 for responders. 
A total of 39 patients were enrolled, 13 in part 1, arm 1; 6 in part 1, arm 2 and 20 in part 2. Thirty-
two of 39 patients (82%) were diagnosed with sALCL (6 ALK-positive, 26 ALK-negative). Other 
diagnoses included AITL (n=2), ATLL (n=2), EATL (n=1), and PTCL-NOS (n=2).  
Safety: One DLT of a Grade 3 rash was observed in arm 2 with 1.8 mg/kg BV+ CHP among 6 treated 
patients in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort. Based on this the MAH enrolled patients in Part 
2 of the study at the dose of 1.8 mg/kg. Patients received 6 cycles of A+CHP, administered every 3 
weeks. Refer to clinical safety for further safety outcomes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 22/105 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy: The best ORR was seen in all patients in both treatment regimens (100% ORR). The CR rate 
was 77% for sequential and 92% for combination treatment. Two-year PFS rates were 54% and 56% 
for the sequential and combination treatment regimens, respectively. Three-year OS rates were 62% 
and 80% in the sequential and combination treatment groups, respectively. 
The MAH considered that the MTD was not reached at 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin. Thus, the 
recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin was 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks in combination with CHP. 
The doses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone were based on approved 
labelling instructions and institutional standards.

Subjects were randomized at 132 study centers in North America, Europe, and other regions, including 
the Asia Pacific region and the Middle East. 
Treatments 
The administered treatments are shown in Table 8. Brentuximab vedotin IV infusion or placebo was 
administered on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle within 1 hour of completing treatment with other agents 
administered via IV. In the absence of infusion-related reactions, brentuximab vedotin was to be 
administered as a 30-minute infusion. Subjects were to receive 6 to 8 cycles. Dose reduction for 
neuropathy required reducing brentuximab vedotin (placebo) and vincristine (placebo), see Table 9.

Objectives 
Given the results of treatment with brentuximab vedotin in the relapsed and refractory setting, the 
MAH hypothesized that a treatment approach that incorporates brentuximab vedotin as part of multi-
agent frontline induction therapy may yield a PFS and OS benefit. Thus, a superiority trial was 
conducted.

• 
• 
To compare the PFS per IRF between the 2 treatment arms for subjects with sALCL 
To compare the remission rates (CR and ORR) per IRF following the completion of study treatment 
between the 2 treatment arms 
To compare OS between the 2 treatment arms 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 2 treatment arms 
Additional Objectives 
• 
• 
To evaluate medical resource utilization (MRU) and calculate utility values 
To characterize the incidence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) to brentuximab vedotin

Sample size 
Approximately 450 patients (~225 patients per treatment arm) will be randomized in this study. The 
target proportion of patients with a diagnosis of sALCL per central pathology assessment will be 75% 
(±5%). 
Approximately 238 events (progression or death due to any cause) are required for the final analysis 
to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6895 (23.93 months median PFS for the A+CHP arm versus 16.5 months 
for the CHOP arm) using the log-rank test with 80% power and an overall one-sided alpha level of 
0.025. 
An accrual period of 42 months (approximately 11 patients per month) is anticipated. An additional 18-
month follow-up period is expected post-accrual of last patient to observe the specified number of PFS 
events with a 5% overall drop-out rate. Assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.6895, a total of 
approximately 450 patients will be randomized.  
The sample size was amended during the study based on analysis of blinded pooled data from this 
study, final PFS data from the lead-in safety study (SGN35-011), and newly available data from the 
International T-Cell Project (TCP), the sponsor determined that ECHELON-2's original design 
overestimated the event accrual rate. The protocol was amended twice (see also conduct of the study) 
in relation to the sample size: 
• 
• 
In March 2015 (amendment 3) the sample size was updated from 300 to 450.  
In May 2018 (amendment 4) it was indicated that the final primary analysis of PFS per IRF would 
occur after the earliest of a total of 238 events in the ITT analysis set or in August 2018 if 238 PFS 
events had not been accrued before that time 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed centrally using an interactive web response system (IWRS) that 
assigned a unique subject randomization number but did not specify the actual treatment assignment. 
Randomization numbers and their corresponding treatment assignments were assigned to subjects per 
the randomization list by sequential ascending block number, and by sequential ascending 
randomization numbers within the appropriate strata. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive either A+CHP or CHOP. Randomization was 
stratified by: 
•  ALK-positive sALCL versus all other histologic types (per local pathology assessment) 
• 
International Prognostic Index (IPI) (0-1, 2-3 and 4-5) 
Blinding (masking) 
Brentuximab vedotin and vincristine were dispensed in a double-blinded, double-dummy manner. A 
pharmacy blind was enforced and investigators, subjects, the IRF, and the sponsor were blinded to 
treatment assignments. 
Unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment prior to study closure was permitted at the time of 
documented disease progression or in emergency circumstances (via a formal unblinding procedure).

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomized subjects. The 
efficacy analysis were done in the ITT set. The Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who received 
any amount of brentuximab vedotin or any component of CHOP; subjects who received any dose of 
brentuximab vedotin were analysed in the A+CHP arm; subjects who did not receive brentuximab 
vedotin but received any dose of any component of CHOP were analysed in the CHOP arm. 
PFS: the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of progressive disease 
(PD), death due to any cause, or receipt of subsequent anticancer chemotherapy to treat residual or 
progressive disease, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess PFS. The 
stratified log-rank test without adjustments for covariates was used in the primary evaluation of PFS 
using the ITT analysis set and was tested at an overall one-sided, α=0.025 level. Cox regression of 
PFS was used to estimate the hazard ratio of the A+CHP arm to the CHOP arm. Censoring rules for the 
primary analysis of PFS are summarized in Table 10. 
Table 10. PFS censoring rules 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS per IRF will be performed, including, but will not be limited to, the 
following: 
1. A stratified log-rank analysis using the stratification factors as recorded in the CRF at baseline 
2. An analysis where patients receiving SCT or consolidative radiotherapy are censored 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 28/105 
 
 
 
 
 
3. An analysis where patients receiving new anticancer therapy are censored rather than considered to 
have had an event 
4. An analysis assessing the impact of missing data/assessments where patients who missed one or 
more of the most recent scheduled assessments are treated as events at the time of the next 
scheduled assessment on the experimental arm 
5. An analysis where initiation of consolidative radiotherapy and undocumented progression (e.g. 
progression identified by the Investigator on the basis of symptomatic deterioration) are considered 
events 
6. An analysis where, for patients with a CR at EOT, initiation of consolidative radiotherapy or receipt 
of SCT are considered events 
7. An analysis where patients who discontinue treatment for undocumented progression after the last 
radiographic tumor assessment are considered to have had an event at the time of treatment 
discontinuation; and where patients who die or progress after more than one consecutively missed 
radiographic tumor assessment are considered to have had an event on the date of death or 
progression 
8. An analysis following EMA censoring guidelines where receipt of new anticancer therapy is not 
considered an event nor a reason for censoring and where patients who die or progress after more 
than one consecutively missed radiographic tumor assessment are considered to have had an event on 
the date of death or progression 
Key secondary endpoints: A fixed sequence testing procedure (Westfall 2001) will be used to ensure 
type I error control for key secondary endpoints at an overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
PFS per IRF in Subjects with sALCL: endpoint was analysed in the same manner as the primary 
analysis of PFS per IRF. Subjects needed to have a central confirmation of the sALCL diagnosis. 
Complete Remission Rate: The CR rate was defined as the proportion of subjects with CR per IRF 
following the completion of study treatment according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Subjects whose disease response was not assessable were scored as non-
responders for calculating the CR rate. The CR rate between treatment arms was tested using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by the randomization stratification factors. The 
absolute CR rate and exact two-sided 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method (Clopper 1934) were 
summarized by treatment arm. 
Overall Survival: OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause (OS=date 
of death – date of randomization + 1). Any subject for whom death was not already known was 
censored for OS on the date the subject was last known to be alive (i.e., date of last contact), or data 
cut-off date. Subjects lacking data beyond the day of randomization were censored on the date of 
randomization (i.e., OS duration of 1 day).The stratified log-rank test without adjustments for 
covariates was used in the evaluation of OS between treatment arms. OS was analysed using Kaplan 
Meier methodology. The two-sided 95% CIs for the median were calculated using the complementary 
log-log transformation method (Collett 1994).  
Objective Response Rate: The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or PR per IRF 
following the completion of study treatment according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma (Cheson 2007). Subjects whose disease response was not assessable were scored as non-
responders for calculating the ORR. The ORR between the treatment arms was tested using the CMH

method, stratified by the randomization stratification factors. The absolute ORR and exact two-sided 
95% confidence interval using the Clopper-Pearson method (Clopper 1934) were summarized by 
treatment arm. 
ATA: The ATA incidence rate is defined as the proportion of patients that develop ATA at any time 
during the study. ATA incidence will be summarized by treatment group. 
MRU: Medical resource utilization data include medical care encounters related to study treatment or 
treatment for lymphoma. Medical resource utilization (MRU) data were summarized using descriptive 
statistics by treatment group.  
QoL: Quality of life was measured using 3 different PRO instruments: the EORTC QLQC30, FACT/GOG-
NTX, and EQ-5D-3L. PRO instrument total/subscale scores and change from baseline were summarized 
by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics. In addition, the change from baseline was 
analysed using linear mixed models. Sensitivity analyses for missing data were conducted using 
imputation and pattern mixture models. PRO scores were also summarized by PFS status. PRO were 
measured at C1,D1, C2&3, D1, EOT and at long term follow up.  
Multiplicity: 
A fixed-sequence testing procedure was performed for the key secondary endpoints at an unadjusted 
alpha level until the preceding null hypothesis was not rejected. Testing was carried out in the 
following order: 0) PFS per IRF (primary endpoint); 1) PFS per IRF for subjects with centrally-
confirmed sALCL; 2) CR per IRF; 3) OS; and 4) ORR per IRF. 
One formal interim analysis for futility was planned for this study when approximately 50% of patients 
have completed EOT. This analysis focuses on the CR after EOT. At this analysis a cut-off date for the 
database was to be determined. 
Missing data: 
Apart from time-to-event endpoints and setting missing to failure for ORR and CR, all other endpoints 
excluded patients with missing data.   
Pooling of strata: 
In case of empty strata, pooling rules were prespecified. In general, missing strata defined by IPI & 
ALK positive sALCL will be pooled with the same IPI score and ‘other types than ALK positive’ sALCL  
(see the SAP).  
The primary analysis of PFS per IRF will occur after the earliest of  
• 
a total of 238 events in the ITT analysis set have occurred 
•  August 2018 if 238 PFS events have not been accrued before that time. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 449 subjects (99%) received treatment as randomized. Three subjects randomized to the 
A+CHP arm did not receive study treatment; 1 subject withdrew consent prior to treatment, 1 subject 
died prior to treatment, and 1 subject was found to be ineligible after randomization and was 
withdrawn from the study.

• 
PFS censoring dates have been updated from study day 1 or first dose date to the date of 
randomization for consistency. PFS sensitivity analysis following EMA censoring guidelines added to 
support submission to EMA 
Amendment 4 Changes (15 May 2018) 
•  Specified that the primary efficacy analysis of PFS per IRF will use a data cut-off of August 2018 if 
the protocol-specified number of 238 PFS events have not been accrued before that time. 
•  Clarified that new anticancer therapy for progressive disease will also be considered a PFS event. 
Protocol deviations and violations 
Important protocol deviations (defined as protocol violations by Seattle Genetics) are those that 
represent a divergence from the protocol that could have a significant effect on the integrity of the 
study data, or on subject’s rights, safety, or welfare. Of the 452 subjects randomized in the study, 55 
(12%) had a protocol violation. The proportion of subjects who had protocol violations was the same 
on each treatment arm: 27 subjects (12%) on the A+CHP arm and 28 subjects (12%) on the CHOP 
arm. See Table 11. 
Table 11. Protocol deviations ITT 
Approximately half of the study conduct violations were related to stratification errors, which were 
reported for 6 subjects (3%) on each treatment arm. The other study conduct violations were primarily 
related to isolated instances where procedures/visits were not done. The majority of the drug 
administration violations (12 of 22) consisted of instances where subjects received the wrong dose of 
treatment. 
Three site-level violations were reported; 2 of these (Sites 48001 and 36002) were drug accountability 
violations where a shipment of study drug was lost. In both cases, the staff were retrained, and the 
violations were not repeated. The 3rd site-level violation (Site 39002) was related to repeated failure 
to conduct CT scans of the neck. The site staff was retrained on appropriate scanning procedures, and 
potential corrective action was discussed and agreed upon with the Investigator. 
A total of 8 potential unblinding incidents occurred in error for single subjects or subsets of subjects, 
both at the sponsor and study site level. In 3 cases, emails containing potentially unblinding 
information were sent from the central PK lab to sponsor staff and another 3 cases emails were sent 
from study site to sponsor staff. Two cases involved site staff being potentially unblinded to their 
subject’s assignments. In each case, emails/communications that contained potentially unblinding 
information were quickly recalled and deleted from affected mailboxes/computers to control further 
dissemination of the data.

Baseline data 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT analysis set, which included all 452 randomized 
subjects; 226 subjects randomized to A+CHP and 226 subjects randomized to CHOP. In total 45% of 
the patients derived from sites in the EU, 28% from the US, 21% from Asia and 6% from other sites.  
A summary of demographics and subject characteristics is shown in Table 12, Table 13 and Table 14.

•  AITL:  18% in the A+CHP arm and 15% in the CHOP arm 
•  ATLL: 60% in the A+CHP arm and 70% in the CHOP arm 
• 
EATL: 90% in the A+CHP arm and 55% in the CHOP arm 
Exposure 
The duration of treatment was similar between the treatment arms; the median number of cycles 
received was the same on both treatment arms; 6.0 (range, 1 to 8). 
In total 156 (70%) of the patients in the A+CHP arm received 6 cycles of treatment and 140 (62%) 
patients in the CHOP arm and respectively 18% and 19% of subjects receiving 8 cycles. 
The median number of weeks of treatment per subject was 18.1 (range, 3 to 34) on the A+CHP arm 
and 18.0 (range, 3 to 31) on the CHOP arm.

The median cumulative brentuximab vedotin dose was 762.0 mg (range 94, 1431) in A+CHP arm. The 
median cumulative vincristine dose was 12 mg (range 2, 16) in the control arm. The exposure of 
cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was comparable between the two arms. (See also clinical safety 
section.) 
Subsequent therapies  
For a summary of all subsequent anti-cancer therapies, see Table 15 .Brentuximab vedotin-containing 
therapy was given in 23 (10%) of the A+CHP patients and in 49 (22%) of the CHOP arm. From these 
patients, objective responses were attained by 13/23 subjects (57%) on the A+CHP arm and 24/49 
subjects (49%) on the CHOP arm. 
In total 50 patients (22%) in the A+CHP arm and 39 patients in the CHOP arm (17%) received SCT, 
see table below.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis PFS per IRF 
As of the 15 August 2018 data cut-off date, 219 subjects (48%) had experienced a PFS event; 95/226 
subjects (42%) on the A+CHP arm and 124/226 subjects (55%) on the CHOP arm. PFS per IRF was 
significantly improved on the A+CHP arm compared with the CHOP arm (stratified HR 0.71 [95% CI: 
0.54, 0.93], P=0.011) (Table 17).

PFS per IRF for sALCL patients 
The PFS for subjects with sALCL was significantly improved on the A+CHP arm compared with the 
CHOP arm (stratified HR 0.59 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.84], P=0.0031). The median PFS per IRF for subjects 
with sALCL was 55.66 months (95% CI: 48.20, –) on the A+CHP arm versus 54.18 months (95% CI: 
13.44, –) on the CHOP arm.

CR Rate 
At the end of treatment, the CR rate by IRF assessment was 68% [61.2, 73.7] for subjects on the 
A+CHP arm compared with 56% [ CI: 49.0,62.3] for subjects on the CHOP arm (p=0.0066). The rate 
difference was 11.9[3.1, 20.8], p-value 0.0066. The median duration of CR was similar on both 
treatment arms (52.70 months [range, 0.03+ to 57.46+] for A+CHP versus 49.94 months [range, 
0.03+ to 57.43+] for CHOP). Concordance rates between IRF and investigator were (~82%) for the CR 
rate. 
Overall survival 
The median OS observation time is 42.12 months. In total 124 (27%) OS events were observed. In 
the A+CHP arm 51 (23%) events and 73 (32%) in the CHOP arm. The median OS had not been 
reached in either treatment arm. The stratified HR was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.95), p=0.0244.

ORR Rate 
The ORR at EOT by IRF assessment was 83% [77.7, 87.8] for subjects on the A+CHP arm compared 
with 72% [ 65.8, 77.9] for subjects on the CHOP arm (p=0.0032) (Table 26). The rate difference was 
11.1 [3.4, 18.7], p-value=0.0032. The median duration of objective response was similar on both 
treatment arms (52.70 months [range, 0.03 to 57.46+] for A+CHP versus 51.35 months [range, 
0.03+ to 57.86+] for CHOP). Concordance rates between IRF and investigator for ORR were (~92%).

Additional endpoints 
Incidence of ATA to Brentuximab Vedotin and effect on PFS 
On the A+CHP arm, baseline ATA samples were available for 205 of 226 subjects in the ITT analysis 
set; samples were missing for 18 subjects, and 3 subjects did not receive study treatment. The 
majority of subjects were ATA-negative at baseline (81%) and most remained ATA-negative 
throughout post-baseline visits.  
A total of 49/205 subjects (24%) tested positive for ATA at any post-baseline visit; 40 subjects who 
were ATA-negative at baseline and 9 who were ATA-positive at baseline. Of the 49 ATA-positive 
subjects, 47 (96%) were transiently ATA-positive, and 2 (4%) were persistently ATA-positive. The 
majority of ATA-positive subjects first showed a positive result at Cycle 2. No notable differences were 
observed between the PFS curves or PFS outcomes for ATA-negative and transiently ATA-positive 
subjects. The 2 subjects who were persistently ATA-positive did not have PFS events and were 
censored between 36 and 54 months (data shown in CSR). 
Five subjects on the A+CHP arm tested positive for neutralizing antibodies (nATA) to brentuximab 
vedotin. Four of the 5 nATA-positive subjects first tested positive for nATA at Cycle 2; the other 
subject first tested positive at Cycle 3. All 5 subjects had an objective response, although 2 of the 5 
subjects subsequently progressed. 
Medical Resource Utilization 
The number of subjects with medical encounters was 142 (63%) in the A+CHP arm and 144 in the 
CHOP arm (64%). The median days hospitalized per subject was 28.0 and 29.0 days respectively. In 
the A+CHP arm the most frequent reason for hospitalization was related to an AE that started during

the treatment period and is ongoing (37% of the subjects; 23% in the control arm) and chemotherapy 
in the control arm (38%; 28% in the experimental arm). 
Quality of Life 
• 
EORTC QLQ c-30: The mean total scores are shown in Figure 11. While the scores were 
numerically lower in the A+CHP arm compared to CHOP arm, there was no statistically significant 
difference between the two treatment arms in total score. Some statistically significant differences 
between the 2 arms in change from baseline scores in favour of CHOP were observed across some 
cycles role functioning (Cycles 2 through 6), social functioning (Cycles 2, 3, and 6), diarrhoea 
(Cycles 2 and 7), nausea & vomiting (Cycles 2 and 7), pain (Cycles 2, 3, and 4). However, Only 
Diarrhoea at Cycle 7, which favoured CHOP, was considered clinically meaningful based on the MID 
of 10 (Osoba 1998).  
•  Neurotoxicity scores for the FACT/GOG-NTX subscale were not  meaningfully different between the 
treatment arms, except for at EOT, where it favoured CHOP (Figure 11).

Subsequent Anti-tumour Therapies 
At the time of the primary analysis, a lower proportion of subjects on the A+CHP arm had received 
subsequent antitumor therapies compared with subjects on the CHOP arm (29% versus 42%). A total 
of 72 subjects (16%) received brentuximab vedotin-containing subsequent therapy: 
23 subjects (10%) on the A+CHP arm and 49 subjects (22%) on the CHOP arm. Objective responses 
were attained by 13/23 subjects (57%) on the A+CHP arm and 24/49 subjects (49%) on the CHOP 
arm.  
The time to subsequent therapy favoured A+CHP over CHOP (HR 0.57 [0.41, 0.78]); the median time 
was not reached in either arms. 
Table 28 Summary of Subsequent Treatment - ITT Analysis Set
Receipt of Subsequent Stem Cell Transplantation 
Multiple analyses by treatment arm and receipt or non-receipt of subsequent stem cell transplantation 
(SCT) were conducted for the ITT population (data on file). These included analyses of PFS per IRF, 
OS, best overall response, and response at the end of treatment. Safety summaries were also 
produced by SCT status, and time to SCT was analysed by treatment arm among the subset of ITT 
patients receiving subsequent SCT.  
A total of 50 subjects (22%) on the A+CHP arm versus 39 subjects (17%) on the CHOP arm received 
consolidative SCT following completion of study treatment. Consolidative radiotherapy was received by

Of 219 patients who experienced a PFS event, 189 patients experienced a PFS event other than death; 
82 patients (36%) in the A+CHP arm and 107 patients (47%) in the CHOP arm.

A total of 57 of the 226 A+CHP arm patients (25% of A+CHP patients) received subsequent systemic 
anticancer therapy to treat residual or progressive disease compared with 94 of 226 CHOP patients 
(42% of CHOP patients), and brentuximab vedotin was the most frequently used subsequent 
anticancer therapy in both arms (21 of 57 A+CHP patients compared with 48 of 94 CHOP patients). 
Despite the use of brentuximab vedotin as subsequent therapy in the control arm, a statistically 
significant OS advantage was still observed in the A+CHP treatment arm. 
Exploratory Analyses of CD30 Expression and Efficacy 
No difference in PFS was seen in a pre-specified analysis of CD30 expression levels above and below 
the median. The variability of CD30 expression levels across different histological subtypes confounded 
the analysis and limited the interpretation of the results.  
Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between CD30 expression and 
overall response and duration of response in non-sALCL patients. In both AITL and PTCL-NOS 
subtypes, CRs at the end of treatment were observed across the range of CD30 expression values, 
including those at the bottom of the range (10%) included in the trial for patients treated with A+CHP. 
In addition, durable CRs were observed in AITL and PTCL-NOS patients treated with A+CHP, even for 
patients with low CD30 expression. Similar results were observed with CHOP.

Treatment assignments unblinding prior to the primary analysis occurred for 128 subjects 
overall; 55 subjects on the A+CHP arm and 73 subjects on the CHOP arm. Ten instances of unblinding 
were for emergency circumstances (4 subjects on the A+CHP arm and 6 subjects on the CHOP arm) 
and 118 instances of unblinding were for individual subjects who had progressed (51 subjects on the 
A+CHP arm and 67 subjects on the CHOP arm). The MAH declares that in all cases the sponsor 
remained blinded. 
Analyses per investigator: PFS per investigator (HR 0.70 [0.53, 0.92], p=0.0096) was similar to 
PFS per IRF. Of the 452 cases assessed for PFS events, 438 (97%) were concordant between the 
investigator and IRF. A similar level of concordance was observed in both treatment arms (96% for 
A+CHP; 98% for CHOP).  
The response rate difference for the CR rate per investigator (CR rate difference was 12.4 [3.7, 21.2), 
p=0.0043) was slightly higher than the IRF analysis. The response rate difference for ORR rate per 
investigator  was comparable to the  IRF analysis (ORR difference per investigator was 11.1 [3.9, 
18.2], p value-0.0018).

Notes 
aFor the sALCL population: PFS per IRF is calculated using patients with 
centrally- confirmed sALCL, with n=163 patients in A+CHP arm and n=151 
in CHOP arm. OS, CR and ORR are calculated using patients with locally-
diagnosed sALCL. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Results from literature, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of brentuximab vedotin in PTCL (Pro, Horwitz, 
Fanale), and the ECHELON-2 study are presented. Taken together, the supportive evidence from case 
reports and case series in PTCL histological subtypes not included in ECHELON-2 allows for 
extrapolation of efficacy and safety to between 81-98% of PTCL histologies.

Supportive study(ies) 
The Applicant submitted supportive study SGN35-012, a phase 2 single arm trial study of 
brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The main 
study population of this study consisted of r/r DLBCL patients with the aim of studying brentuximab 
vedotin monotherapy and combination therapy with rituximab, but also patients with relapsed or 
refractory PTCL were studied in Part A of the study. This part was designed to evaluate the antitumor 
activity of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL.  
In total 13 patients with AITL and 22 patients with PTCL-NOS were included. Most patients had 
advanced disease, refractory to frontline therapy. Retrospective, it was shown that 6 of the CD30+ 
patients (17%) had CD30-negative disease (n=2 AITL and n=4 PTCL-NOS). 
The ORR was 41% [24.6, 59.3] for total CD30+ T-cell lymphomas treated with brentuximab vedotin 
monotherapy, including 54% [25.1, 80.8] for CD30+ AITL patients and 33% [14.6, 57] for patients 
with PTCL-NOS.  
The CR rate was 24% [10.7, 41.2] for total CD30+ T-cell lymphomas including 38% [13.9, 68.4] for 
CD30+ AITL patients and 14% [3, 36.3] for patients with PTCL-NOS. The estimated median duration of 
objective response by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 7.6 months [1.4, NE].  
The estimated median PFS was 2.5 months [1.4, 6.1], 6.7 months for AITL patients, and 1.6 months 
for patients with PTCL-NOS. The median OS was 18.1 months [6.8, 33.6], 20.1 months for AITL, and 
17 months for PTCL-NOS. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study ECHELON-2 (SGN35-014) was a randomized, double-blind controlled study of 
brentuximab vedotin and CHP (A+CHP) versus CHOP for treatment-naïve CD30 positive PTCL patients. 
This design was acceptable.  
The PTCL types that were allowed in the study were sALCL (ALK+ IPI score ≥2 and all ALK-), PTCL-
NOS, AITL, ATTL, EATL and HSTCL. It should be noted that the WHO 2016 classifies these as separate 
entities due to differences in disease biology and therapeutic strategies. The above PTCL types 
represent a large part of the target population. The remaining types are very rare in the EU, except for 
patients with ALK+ IPI score<2 and NKTCL, the 6th most common subtype in the EU. Some subgroups 
of PTCL (nodal, extranodal and leukemic) were excluded from the pivotal study. In addition, all disease 
stages were eligible, although for Stage 1 patients shortened chemotherapy schedule followed by 
curatively intended radiotherapy is recommended (ESMO guideline). For enrolment, the trial required 
CD30 expression ≥10% per immunohistochemistry (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).  
Importantly, the protocol required 75± 5% of the study participants to have a sALCL diagnosis, as the 
ECHELON-2 study serves to fulfil the category 3 commitment as agreed upon at time of the MAA (MEA-
015). As sALCL constitutes 15% of the PTCLs, sALCL is overrepresented in the study population. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 58/105 
 
 
 
could be of concern in relation to the broad applied indication of CD30+  PTCL population. Moreover, 
sALCL differs from other subtypes in terms of biology, prognosis (ALK+ has a better prognosis, but 
also ALK- ALCL than other PTCL types) and CD30 expression (ALCL per definition expresses CD30 cell 
≥75%, in other subtypes the frequency and intensity of CD30 expression varies). Based on this 
information, it is not evident that results in sALCL PTCL can be extrapolated to other CD30+ PTCL 
types. As per the CHMP advice informative numbers of patients with different subtypes needed to be 
included as PTCL is a heterogeneous disease (EMA/288880/2012). 
The dosing regimen of brentuximab vedotin (in combination with CHP) is the same as the monotherapy 
dose (1.8mg/kg q3w). This dose and regimen was investigated in the Phase 1 study SGN35-011. The 
study included an option for a reduced dosing of 1.2 mg/kg in case the initial dose of 1.8 mg/kg would 
lead to unacceptable toxicity. As only 1 DLT was observed in 6 treated patients at that dose the MTD 
was determined to be 1.8 mg/kg for the combination therapy. The choice of replacing vincristin with 
brentuximab vedotin was considered reasonable by CHMP (EMA SA 2012) given the related mechanism 
of action for vincristine and the cytostatic component of brentuximab vedotin (MMAE). Patients were to 
receive 6-8 cycles of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and CHP and vincristine placebo in the 
experimental arm and 6-8 cycles of CHOP and brentuximab vedotin placebo in the control arm. 
CHOP is considered an acceptable control treatment for most patients. However, in ESMO clinical 
guidance, CHOEP is an option for fit patients ≤60 years of age with nodal PTCL (PTCL-NOS, AITL, 
ALCL) as population-based studies indicate an EFS benefit of CHOEP over CHOP, but no OS benefit has 
been shown. The CHMP had suggested to allow addition of etoposide in the control arm for younger 
patients with ALK+ ALCL on physician’s discretion (EMA/288880/2012) however the actual contribution 
of etoposide to CHOP is not fully determined in terms of OS. It is stated in section 5.1 of the SmPC 
that only patients with CD30+ PTCLs for whom a CHOP-based regimen is recommended were eligible 
for enrolment. 
The primary endpoint in SGN35-014 was PFS per IRF, defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of first documentation of progressive disease, death due to any cause, or 
receipt of subsequent anticancer chemotherapy to treat residual or progressive disease, whichever 
occurs first. Receipt of post-treatment consolidative radiotherapy, post-treatment chemotherapy for 
the purpose of mobilising peripheral blood stem cells, or consolidative autologous or allogeneic stem 
cell transplant were not considered as disease progression or as having started new anticancer 
therapy. Key secondary endpoints included PFS per IRF for patients with centrally-confirmed sALCL, CR 
rate per IRF following the completion of study treatment, OS and ORR per IRF following the completion 
of study treatment which were tested by a fixed sequence testing procedure following the statistical 
significance of PFS per IRF.  
The primary and key secondary endpoints are considered appropriate to evaluate the benefit of A+CHP 
in PTCL patients and were agreed in the context of CHMP scientific advice.  
The primary PFS analysis patients were censored for post-treatment chemotherapy for stem cell 
mobilization and consolidative radiotherapy, and new anti-cancer therapy was considered an event. 
The first is not representative of clinical practice which considers SCT a treatment goal to postpone 
progression and the latter is not in accordance with EMA guidance. Therefore, PFS sensitivity analysis 
in accordance with EMA guidance was considered important. 
Efficacy analysis was on a true ITT set. The assessment schedule for PFS is considered sufficiently 
granular given the median PFS in the control arm. Analyses methods for CR and ORR considered 
missing data as failures and are acceptable. Key secondary endpoints were tested in a fixed sequence 
testing procedure, which is acceptable to control type I error. One interim analysis was planned which 
is considered acceptable as it was only for futility and executed by an independent DMC. The protocol 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 59/105 
 
 
 
allowed for unblinding at request at time of documented progression to determine subsequent 
treatment. This was considered acceptable in the scientific advice (EMA/559606/2012). Of note, 
according to the SAP all endpoints except time to event endpoints (and apparently ORR and CR) had 
patients deleted from the analysis if data were missing.   
Changes in the protocol affecting the primary outcome (PFS) included the following:  
- 
The sample size was amended during the study based on analysis of blinded pooled data from this 
study, final PFS data from the lead-in safety study (SGN35-011), and newly available data from 
the International T-Cell Project (TCP), the sponsor determined that original design of ECHELON-2 
overestimated the event accrual rate. As this was not driven by seeing (unblinded) outcomes and 
effectively only changed the timing but not the number of analyses, this is considered acceptable. 
- 
The timing of the final analysis was changed from reaching 238 events to either reaching that or 
reaching August 2018, whichever occurred first. The data cut-off was in August 2018 with 219 
events (48%). This is considered acceptable as the targeted number of events is almost reached. 
-  New anti-cancer therapy was labelled as event for the primary PFS analysis.  
-  A sensitivity analysis using the EMA censoring rules for PFS was added. 
- 
The PFS interim analysis for efficacy was removed, which strengthens the design.   
Protocol violations were evenly distributed among the two arms, did not have a high frequency and are 
not expected to have impacted outcomes, except for that there were 8 potential unblinding incidents. 
It is unlikely that these reported events have impacted study results to a large extent. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The ITT analysis set consisted of 452 subjects, 226 in the A+CHP arm and 226 in the CHOP arm. The 
baseline demographic characteristics are representative for the EU target PTCL population. Regarding 
disease characteristics, as per protocol most patients had sALCL (70%; ALK- 48%, ALK+22%). Other 
subtypes studied were PTCL-NOS (16%), AITL 12%, ATLL (n=7; 2%) and EATL (n=3;1%) and no 
HSTCL patients were included. Since ATLL and HSTCL are very rare and EATL patients have a poor 
performance status, low recruitment for these subtypes may be expected. The enrolled population 
mainly reflects the nodal entities of PTCL whereas extranodal (EATL, N=3) and leukemic (ATLL, N=7) 
subtypes are rarely reflected.  
The primary endpoint and alpha-protected, key secondary endpoints, which were evaluated 
hierarchically, were met. The median PFS per IRF for the ITT population was 48.2 months on the 
ADCETRIS + CHP arm versus 20.8 months on the CHOP arm. The stratified hazard ratio was 
0.71 (95% CI: 0.54; 0.93, p=0.011), indicating a 29% reduction in the risk of PFS events for 
ADCETRIS + CHP versus CHOP. For overall survival, the stratified hazard ratio was 
0.66 (95% CI: 0.46; 0.95, p=0.024), a 34% reduction in the risk of OS events for ADCETRIS + CHP 
versus CHOP.  
PFS per IRF for patients with centrally-confirmed sALCL was a pre-specified key secondary endpoint. 
The median PFS per IRF was 55.7 months on the ADCETRIS + CHP arm versus 54.2 months on the 
CHOP arm. The stratified hazard ratio was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.42; 0.84), compatible with a statistically 
significant 41% reduction in the risk of PFS events for ADCETRIS + CHP versus CHOP 
(p-value=0.003). 
Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with locally-diagnosed sALCL. For overall survival, the 
stratified hazard ratio was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.34; 0.87), a 46% reduction in the risk of OS events for 
Assessment report

ADCETRIS + CHP versus CHOP. At the end of treatment, the CR rate by IRF assessment was 71.0% 
for patients on the A+CHP arm compared with 53.2% for patients on the CHOP arm with a difference 
of 17.7% (95% CI: 7.2%; 28.3%). At the end of treatment, the ORR rate by IRF assessment was 
87.7% for patients on the A+CHP arm compared with 70.8% for patients on the CHOP arm with a 
difference of 16.9% (95% CI: 8.1%; 25.7%). In the subgroup of patients with ALK+ sALCL and ALK- 
sALCL the stratified hazard ratio for PFS per IRF was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.11; 0.79) and 0.65 (95% CI: 
0.44; 0.95), respectively.  
Superiority in primary definition of PFS of A+CHP over the CHOP arm has been shown in the overall 
study population (HR 0.71 [0.54, 0.93], p=0.011), best represented by differences in PFS event rates 
at 1 year (71.7% versus 58.2%) and 2 years (61.4% versus 47.4%,) due to plateau formation in the 
KM curves. The difference in PFS rate ≥1 year, when the curves are flattening, is indicative of longer 
term benefit. The observed effect size is deemed clinically relevant. Possible informative drop-out 
(subject withdrawal + lost to follow-up + other) was balanced between arms and small (A+CHP vs 
CHOP: 16+0+2 vs 10+4+0, i.e. 8.0 vs 6.2%), the same holds for possibly informative censoring, 
which are not likely to impact the efficacy conclusions.  
As stated above, PFS sensitivity analysis 8 (i.e., according to EMA censoring rules) is the preferred 
analysis. The PFS HR is 0.76 [0.58,0.99], p=0.0443 in this analysis. The PFS rates at 1 year of 74.0% 
versus 62.5% in the A+CHP vs CHOP arm and at 2 year respectively 62.3% versus 50.9%, are 
supportive of the primary analysis. Informative censoring also does not appear to have impacted the 
outcomes of this sensitivity analyses. 
PFS is supported by differences in CR rate (68% versus 56%, p=0.0066) and ORR rate (83% versus 
72%, p=0.0032) favoring A+CHP over CHOP (ITT population). Median duration of response 
(respectively 52.7 versus 51.4 months) was similar between the two arms. It is encouraging that 
response rate outcomes are driven by the difference in CRs. The OS is immature with a total 124 
(27%) OS events observed (median OS not reached) and influenced by subsequent therapies, but in 
support of PFS (OS HR 0.66 [0.46, 0.95], p=0.0244). Thus, the clinically relevant PFS differences at 1 
or 2 year with flattening of the KM curve after 1 year, is supported by a trend in OS in favour of 
A+CHP over CHOP. Notably, an OS benefit has not previously been shown for first line PTCL patients 
compared to CHOP. The MAH committed to providing the final OS analysis. 
In the ECHELON-2 study approximately 70% of the studied patients were diagnosed with sALCL, as 
such the number of subjects representing other PTCL subgroups are small, making the interpretation 
of the efficacy of A+CHP over CHOP difficult for non-sALCL subjects, especially in light of the only 
limited benefit of  the A+CHP regimen over CHOP in some cases (HR 0.96). Additional ad-hoc analyses 
conducted by the applicant, included PFS, CR rate for non sALCL histologies (PTCL-NOS, AITL, ATLL, 
EATL combined and individually).  These were not powered for statistical analysis and the small sample 
size limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions.  
In order to extrapolate the hazard ratio for PFS for the subtypes, a semiparametric Bayesian 
hierarchical model (BHM) was implemented. Extrapolation of outcomes from sALCL patients to non-
sALCL patients was proposed based on CD30 expression. The BHM was based on biological and 
prognostic similarities between ECHELON-2 patients and rare subgroups, including five subtypes in the 
model (ALK+ sALCL, ALK- sALCL, PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ATLL). EATL subgroup was excluded due to the 
small sample size enrolled in ECHELON-2 (N=3). Hazard Ratio estimates from BHM were smaller than 
1 across different disease subtypes, supporting the conclusion that the superior effect of A+CHP 
compared to CHOP is consistent across histologic subtypes. Robustness of the results were 
demonstrated by sensitivity analyses using four different prior distributions (from informative to non-
informative priors) and additionally by excluding the ALK+sALCL from the BHM, giving consistent 
results.

Additionally, to evaluate the impact of ALK+ sALCL on the shrinkage estimates of the subtype 
specific PFS HRs, a further sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding ALK+ sALCL from 
the BHM. The results are very similar to the model results that include ALK+ sALCL. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the amount of borrowing from ALK+ sALCL is relatively 
limited. 
It has however not been shown that CD30 expression alone is a requirement for a response from 
A+CHP compared to CHOP in non-sALCL patients, nor that that brentuximab vedotin induces a 
significant bystander effect at low CD30 expression. Furthermore, it is questionable whether the BHM 
estimated effects are the true underlying effects of the populations included in the study, as the model 
assumes that the modelled effects in smaller populations (i.e. non-sALCL PTCL types) are similar to 
those in large populations (i.e. sALCL). This assumption is not considered appropriate as updated KM 
curves for PFS and OS per subtype indicate heterogeneity in prognosis (plateau vs non-plateau) and 
treatment effect (non-crossing versus early crossing) across the CD30+ PTCL types. Also, to accurately 
predict outcomes for CD30 PTCL populations not included in the pivotal study the model requires the 
assumption that the range of effects in the included populations is representative for other, not-
included populations. As PTCLs have different disease biology, clinical features, and prognosis, this 
assumption was not supported.   
A threshold of CD30 expression in 10% or greater of neoplastic cells has been used as the definition of 
CD30 positivity (inclusion criterion). The 10% threshold was selected to exceed the local assays' error 
margin in order to give a reliable result of CD30 expression.  Additional analysis on PFS, ORR, and 
duration of response showed that CD30 expression is not predictive of response to A+CHP. 
There are also several other subgroups where the HR of the PFS approaches 1 (patients with stage I/II 
disease, ECOG2, IPI 4-5 and Asian patients), most likely this is due to the small number of subjects in 
these subgroups.  
There was no clinically meaningful difference in QoL in the A+CHP arm compared to CHOP arm, except 
for diarrhoea in cycle 7 which reached a moderate MID difference, which is not considered sufficiently 
consistent for concerns on diminished QoL in A+CHP patients compared to CHOP. Exploratory analyses 
indicate no notable difference in medical resource utilization.  
Brentuximab vedotin-containing subsequent therapy was given in 23 (10%) of the A+CHP patients and 
in 49 (22%) of the CHOP arm. Responses were attained by 13/23 subjects (57%) on the A+CHP arm 
and 24/49 subjects (49%) on the CHOP arm. Of note, this is a non-randomized comparison. There is 
no apparent difference in patients who receive SCT (22% in the A+CHP and 17% in the CHOP arm).  
No notable differences were observed between ATA-negative, transiently ATA-positive subjects (n=47) 
and persistently ATA-positive (=2) patients. Five patients were nATA-positive, all had an objective 
response, though 2 of the 5 subjects subsequently progressed; however due to the small number of 
nATA positive patients no definite conclusions on the effects of nATAs can be made. 
The MAH performed a phase 1 study (SGN35-011) of brentuximab vedotin in CD30+ in T-cell and NK-
cell neoplasms. In this study the 1.8mg/kg was tested with CHP. DLTs defined as a delay of ≥7 days in 
CHP therapy in Cycle 1, did not meet the prespecified level which would allow de-escalation of the BV 
dose. The definition of a DLT is not supported, but as no major safety issues have arisen, the dose 
selection is considered acceptable. Efficacy outcomes of those who received A+CHP in this study 
appear supportive for the outcomes of the pivotal study.  
A phase 2 study (SGN35-012), a single arm phase 2 single arm trial of brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg 
as a monotherapy in relapsed or refractory NHL was submitted.  Disease activity as measured by 
overall response rates was observed in patients with relapsed refractory AITL (ORR= 54%, n=13) and 
Assessment report

Page 62/105 
 
 
 
PTCL-NOS (ORR= 33%, n=22). As this was a non-comparative study, it is unclear whether the 
observed effects were beneficial. Also, discrepancies arise as to why efficacy results for the subgroups 
of AITL and PTCL-NOS in 2nd line and with brentuximab vedotin monotherapy are reverse to those in 
the frontline treatment with A+CHP – therefore the use of these results as supportive data was not 
considered. 
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP consulted the SAG Oncology on the following questions: 
1.  Are the results obtained in the overall study population relevant also for the under-represented 
non-sALCL PTCL subtypes? 
A special emphasis was given to the fact that peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) should be referred 
to as PTCL disease entities and not subtypes; although historically they have been considered as a 
heterogenous group but one disease entity, PTCLs are markedly heterogeneous at the clinical, 
pathological, histogenetic, and molecular levels and can have variable prognoses. In the 2016 revision 
of the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms2, mature T and NK cell lymphomas and 
lymphoproliferative disorders comprise 27 distinct entities in addition to PTCL not otherwise specified 
(PTCL-NOS).   
Further, the experts questioned the significance of CD30 expression in CD30+ PTCL entities, that is, 
whether CD30 positivity simply signifies the presence of CD30 in the malignant T-cell  or in bystander 
B-cells (such as in AITL) and by that whether CD30 expression plays a direct role in the proliferation of 
a malignant phenotype or whether it reflects expression in the milieu setting that enhances tumour 
growth and survival. As all these mechanisms maybe present, the relative contribution of each would 
have an impact on the efficiency of targeting CD30 by BV.  
The experts also debated on the correlation of CD-30 expression with A-CHP activity and the MAH’s 
argument that levels just above the arbitrary threshold level of the assay (10%) are associated with a 
CR on A+CHP therapy. It is possible that achieving CR in patients with low CD-30 expression may very 
well be attributed to the backbone treatment (CHP); and consequently, extrapolation of the results 
from highly CD-30+ sALCL to such populations would be problematic.  
Therefore, overall, even if we consider the ECHELON-2 trial as a type of basket protocol of different 
PTCL entities, CD-30 may not be an adequate biomarker to identify responders and allow extrapolating 
considerations in under-represented populations in the study.  
Looking at the data the K-M curves of the non-ALCL entities PTCL NOS and AITL can be seen as 
superimposable for the first year but later on as there are very few patients any conclusions are 
difficult to make. The positive efficacy results in the ITT population are therefore driven by the 
predominant sALCL population. While considering the subgroups presented in the forest plot of PFS 
and OS the results and CI are indeed towards the right direction, however, the point estimates are 
quite different. However, AITL did not seem to follow this pattern for PFS (ITT population). It also has 
to be considered that the disease distribution at the time of design and outset of the trial was likely 
different than what would be selected after applying 2016 criteria that distinguish ALK-negative ALCL

from PTCL NOS and from AITL. There have been significant progress and changes in the allocation of 
lymphomas to these three entities over the recent years. 
A Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) designed by the applicant company to improve the reliability of 
estimates of effect size through borrowing information among the disease entities while still allowing 
for heterogeneity of PFS effect, showed apparent improved estimates of PFS hazard ratios for PTCL 
entities with small sample sizes.  The SAG experts commented in relation to the borrowing of 
information element -based on CD-30 expression- and considered it would be useful to reflect on such 
modelling and under which conditions it could be acceptable to interpret the data. In particular, it was 
considered that the rationale to allow such borrowing has to be obtained externally, since the 
outcome-adaptive approach does not seem to have enough information to determine whether 
borrowing is appropriate and is therefore of limited use (Freidlin B, Korn EL. 2013). Furthermore, 
depending on the admissibility of borrowing, the trial as a whole (where all the data are pooled, i.e., 
extreme borrowing) has to be called into question. 
2.  Can the overall results be extrapolated to PTCL subtypes that were not studied? 
Based on the above considerations the experts would not consider extrapolation to PTCL entities not 
studied in ECHELON-2. Most of PTCL entities not included in the study would not be eligible for 
treatment with a CHOP-based regimen under current recommendations, thus there would be no 
rationale for the A-CHP combination in these entities, e.g. HSTL, EATL, MEITL, ENKTL. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal ECHELON-2 study show in the study population of mainly sALCL patients a 
clinically relevant PFS advantage of A+CHP combination over CHOP supported by secondary efficacy 
parameters, among which a trend to OS benefit. Considering the above discussion, the indication for 
the combination of Adcetris with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (CHP) is restricted to 
adult patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). 
The submission of the ECHELON-2 study also fulfills the post authorisation meausure MEA-015. It was 
agreed with the CHMP that this randomized, controlled trial would examine patients with newly 
diagnosed mature T-cell lymphoma (MTCL, also known as PTCL), including 75% (±5%) of patients 
with sALCL, (N=300), in order to provide safety data in the sALCL population. The ECHELON-2 study 
included 70% of patients with sALCL and submission of the ECHELON-2 study with this application 
serves to fulfill MEA-015 and its required enrollment of 75% (±5%) of patients with sALCL. The MAH 
will provide final OS analysis from ECHELON-2 when available (Q1 2021) in the context of follow-on 
MEA 015.1.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of brentuximab vedotin administered as monotherapy was based on a single arm 
phase II studies in 160 patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL, a placebo 
controlled Phase III trial (AETHERA) in 165 HL patients at increased risk for relapse after ASCT, and a 
phase 3, open-label, randomised, multicentre study in 128 patients with histologically confirmed 
CD30+ CTCL (Study C25001). The safety and tolerability of brentuximab plus chemotherapy for the 
frontline treatment of advanced HL was analysed in the ECHELON-1 study. The combination of

brentuximab with AVD (doxorubicin [A], vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D]) was in line with 
brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy and the known safety profile of the chemotherapy backbone. 
This summary of clinical safety (SCS) presents the clinical safety findings from Study SGN35-014 
(ECHELON-2).   
Patient exposure 
The ECHELON-2 safety population included all patients who received any amount of brentuximab 
vedotin or any component of CHOP. Treatment arm was determined according to the actual treatment 
received, regardless of the randomization treatment assignment. Subjects who received any dose of 
brentuximab vedotin were grouped into the experimental arm. Patients who did not receive 
brentuximab vedotin but received any dose of any component of CHOP were grouped into the 
standard-of-care treatment arm. All safety endpoints were summarized using the safety population, 
which consisted of 223 patients in the A+CHP arm and 226 patients in the CHOP arm. 
A median of 6 cycles (range, 1-8 cycles) of study treatment was reported for patients across the 2 
treatment arms over a median of 18.1 weeks (range, 3-34 weeks) for the A+CHP arm and a median of 
18.0 weeks (range, 3-31 weeks) for the CHOP arm. Administration of 6 cycles of the study treatment 
was planned for 82% of patients in the A+CHP arm and 81% of patients in the CHOP arm; 70% of 
patients in the A+CHP arm and 62% of patients in the CHOP arm received 6 cycles of study treatment.  
Dose Modifications 
Permitted dose modifications included dose delays, dose reductions, dose eliminations (ie, temporary 
stoppages allowed for cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin only), and dose discontinuations (ie, 
stoppages of 1 component in the multi-agent regimen for the remainder of the study). For blinded 
study treatment, the permitted dose reductions defined in the protocol were 1.2 mg/kg for 
brentuximab vedotin and 1 mg for vincristine. Unplanned dose adjustments were considered either 
infusion interruptions, infusions stopped early, or dose errors.

Exposure-Response Analysis Results and Relationship to Safety 
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, Grade 4 or higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and 
Grade 2 or higher PN was evaluated by quartiles of ADC serum or MMAE plasma trough concentrations 
for evaluable subjects in the A+CHP arm.

Demographics  
The ECHELON-2 ITT population consisted of 226 patients each in the A+CHP and CHOP arms. A total of 
133 men (59%) and 93 women (41%) were randomized to the A+CHP arm and 151 men (67%) and 
75 women (33%) were randomized to the CHOP arm. The median age of randomized patients was 58 
years (range, 18-85 years for the A+CHP arm and 18-83 years for the CHOP arm); 31% of patients 
randomized to each treatment arm were aged 65 years or older. An ECOG performance status of 1 was 
reported for 90 patients (40%) in the A+CHP arm and 86 patients (38%) in the CHOP arm and an 
ECOG performance status of 2 was reported for 51 patients (23%) in the A+CHP arm and 47 patients 
(21%) in the CHOP arm (see Clinical efficacy section). 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The ECHELON-2 ITT population consisted of 226 patients each in the A+CHP and CHOP arms. Most of 
the randomized patients had advanced stage and intermediate-risk disease as is typical of this patient 
population at the time of clinical presentation. Baseline disease characteristics are presented in the 
efficacy section.  
Concomitant Medications 
At least 1 concomitant medication was reported for almost all patients in the safety population. The 
most frequently reported concomitant medications (≥25% of patients) for the A+CHP arm were 
ondansetron hydrochloride (48% of patients), allopurinol (42%), paracetamol and filgrastim (39% 
each), pegfilgrastim (34%), Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) (28%), and omeprazole (26%).  
The most frequently reported concomitant for the CHOP arm were paracetamol (41% of patients), 
ondansetron hydrochloride (40%), filgrastim (39%), allopurinol (38%), Bactrim 
(sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) (32%), and pegfilgrastim (26%). 
Assessment report

At least 1 G-CSF concomitant medication was reported for 171 patients (77%) in the A+CHP arm and 
162 patients (72%) in the CHOP arm. Filgrastim and lenograstim were the most commonly reported 
across treatment arms. 
Adverse events 
Safety summaries included AEs reported during the safety evaluation period, defined as the period 
during or after the first dose of the drug regimen up to 30 days after the last dose of any component 
of the drug regimen. The frequency and severity of peripheral neuropathy (PN) reported in the study 
were evaluated by a comprehensive review of the PN Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) broad 
(MedDRA Version 21.0). Patients with ongoing PN after the safety evaluation period were followed until 
of PN resolution or study closure. 
In response to a slightly higher than expected infection rate in the safety population, observed after 
review of the results from the interim futility analysis, the IDMC recommended that the sponsor 
remind investigators of the use of prophylactic growth factor support in accordance with current 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [11] or European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
guidelines. Safety analyses included an assessment of the impact of granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) primary prophylaxis on neutropenia and associated complications, including febrile 
neutropenia and infections. 
TEAEs of any grade, treatment-related (brentuximab vedotin or vincristine) TEAEs, Grade 3 or higher 
TEAEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs that resulted in study treatment discontinuation were 
reported for a similar proportion of patients across treatment arms. SAEs considered related to 
brentuximab vedotin were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the A+CHP arm than the 
SAEs considered related to vincristine for patients in the CHOP arm. A higher proportion of SAEs with 
the outcome of death were reported for the CHOP arm than the A+CHP arm. 
At least 1 treatment-related SAE attributed to brentuximab vedotin was reported for 58 patients (26%) 
in the A+CHP arm and at least 1 treatment-related SAE attributed to vincristine was reported for 45 
patients (20%) in the CHOP arm. At least 1 Grade 5 TEAE was reported for 8 patients (4%) in the 
A+CHP arm and 16 patients (7%) in the CHOP arm.

Of the 147 subjects who had Grade 3 or higher AEs on the A+CHP arm, 62 (42%) had Grade 4 events 
and 8 cases (5 %) had Grade 5 (fatal) events. On the CHOP arm, of the 146 subjects who had Grade 3 
or higher AEs, 63 (43%) had Grade 4 events and 16 cases (11%) had Grade 5 (fatal) events. On both 
the A+CHP arm and the CHOP arm, the most common Grade 4 event was neutropenia, which occurred 
in 46 subjects (21%) on the A+CHP arm versus 47 subjects (21%) on the CHOP arm.  
On the A+CHP arm, brentuximab vedotin-related ≥ Grade 3 AEs reported for ≥10% of subjects were 
neutropenia (30%) and febrile neutropenia (16%). On the CHOP arm, vincristine-related ≥ Grade 3 
AEs reported for ≥10% of subjects were also neutropenia (27%) and febrile neutropenia (12%). 
Adverse Events by Histologic Subtype 
Summaries of TEAEs by disease subtype were presented for subjects with sALCL, subjects with PTCL-
NOS, subjects with AITL, subjects with EATL and subjects with ATLL. The safety profile was generally 
similar across all histologic subtypes evaluated; most common TEAEs occurred at a similar incidence 
across subtypes.  
Adverse Events by Cycles of Treatment 
A summary of TEAEs by preferred term and number of cycles of study treatment received (≤6 versus 
>6 cycles) is presented in the CSR. The overall incidence and profile of TEAEs for both the A+CHP and 
CHOP treatment arms was generally similar regardless of the number of treatment cycles received. 
Deaths 
As of the August 15, 2018 data cut-off date, 123 deaths had been reported; 50 on the A+CHP arm and 
73 on the CHOP arm. Of the 50 deaths on the A+CHP arm, 36 were disease related, 10 were not

disease related, and disease relationship was unknown for 4 subjects. Of the 73 deaths on the CHOP 
arm, 58 were disease related, 7 were not disease related, and disease relationship was unknown for 8 
subjects. One additional subject on the A+CHP arm died after randomization, but before receiving 
study treatment; this subject is included in the OS analysis. 
A total of 21 subjects (5%) died within 30 days of the last dose of any component of the treatment 
regimen; 8 subjects (4%) on the A+CHP arm and 13 subjects (6%) on the CHOP arm. In addition, 3 
subjects on the CHOP arm died due to Grade 5 AEs that had a start date within 30 days of the last 
dose of CHOP, but died outside of the safety analysis period. Approximately half of the deaths within 
30 days of the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen were disease related (11/21; 
52%).  
In both treatment arms, the majority of deaths reported ≥30 days of the last dose of any component 
of the treatment regimen were disease-related (32/42 subjects [76%] on the A+CHP arm and 51/60 
subjects [85%] on the CHOP arm). All AEs resulting in death are summarized below. Death narratives 
have been presented. 
Table 46 Adverse events resulting in death (safety analysis set) 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs were reported for 87 subjects (39%) on the A+CHP arm and 87 subjects (38%) on the CHOP 
arm. The most frequently reported SAEs on the A+CHP arm were febrile neutropenia in 31 subjects 
(14%), pneumonia in 11 subjects (5%), pyrexia in 9 subjects (4%), and neutropenia in 8 subjects 
(4%). All other SAEs were reported for ≤2% of subjects on the A+CHP arm. 
Brentuximab vedotin-related SAEs were reported for 58/223 subjects (26%) on the A+CHP arm;

vedotin-related SAEs that occurred in ≥2% of subjects on the A+CHP arm were febrile neutropenia 
(11%), pneumonia (4%), and neutropenia and sepsis (2% each); all other brentuximab vedotin-
related SAEs occurred in <2% of subjects. Vincristine-related SAEs that occurred in ≥2% of subjects

on the CHOP arm were febrile neutropenia (10%) and neutropenia (2%); all other vincristine-related 
SAEs occurred in <2% of subjects.  
Table 47 Serious adverse events occurring in ≥2 subjects in the A+CHP arm (safety analysis 
set)  
Adverse Events Resulting in Treatment Discontinuation 
A total of 29 subjects (6%) experienced an AE that resulted in discontinuation of all components of 
study treatment; 14 subjects (6%) on the A+CHP arm and 15 subjects (7%) on the CHOP. One 
additional subject on the A+CHP arm (Subject 81005-0208) discontinued treatment due to an AE of 
Grade 3 dyspnoea that occurred outside of the safety analysis period. Two subjects on each arm (1%) 
discontinued treatment due to peripheral sensory neuropathy. All other AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were reported for a single subject. 
Subjects who discontinued brentuximab vedotin or vincristine due to an AE were allowed to continue to 
receive the other components of CHP. Four subjects (2%) in the A+CHP arm discontinued brentuximab 
vedotin treatment, and 5 subjects (2%) in the CHOP arm discontinued vincristine treatment. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Delays 
Doses of brentuximab vedotin were delayed because of AEs in 59/223 subjects (26%) on the A+CHP 
arm; doses of vincristine were delayed because of AEs in 28/226 subjects (12%) on the CHOP arm. 
The most common reasons for dose delays on the A+CHP arm were neutropenia (5%), pneumonia 
(3%), and pyrexia (2%). All other AEs resulting in dose delays on the A+CHP arm occurred in 3 or 
fewer subjects. The most common reasons for dose delays on the CHOP arm were neutropenia (4%), 
and leukopenia and pyrexia (2% each). All other AEs resulting in dose delays on the CHOP arm 
occurred in 1 subject. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020

Doses of brentuximab vedotin were reduced because of AEs in 21/223 subjects (9%) on the A+CHP 
arm; doses of vincristine were reduced because of AEs for 24/226 subjects (11%) on the CHOP arm. 
The most common reasons for dose reductions on the A+CHP arm were peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(5%) and peripheral motor neuropathy (2%). All other AEs resulting in dose reductions on the A+CHP 
arm occurred in ≤1 subject. The most common reasons for dose reductions on the CHOP arm were 
peripheral motor neuropathy (4%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (2%), and febrile neutropenia 
(1%). All other AEs resulting in dose reductions on the CHOP arm occurred in ≤1 subject. 
Peripheral Neuropathy 
Per MedDRA SMQ analysis, a total of 49 subjects (11%) enrolled had pre-existing PN. The proportion 
of subjects with pre-existing PN was the same in both treatment arms (11%). Treatment-emergent PN 
was reported for 117 subjects (52%) on the A+CHP arm and 124 subjects (55%) on the CHOP arm. 
The majority of treatment-emergent PN events on both treatment arms were Grade 1. Thirty-three 
subjects (15%) on the A+CHP arm versus 26 subjects (12%) on the CHOP arm had PN events of 
Grade 2 in worst severity. Worst severity Grade 3 PN was reported for 8 subjects (4%) on the A+CHP 
arm and 10 subjects (4%) on the CHOP arm. Grade 4 PN was reported for a single subject on the 
A+CHP arm. 
Table 48 Overall summary of peripheral neuropathy (SMQ) adverse events (safety analysis 
set)  
Treatment Discontinuation and Dose Modifications for Peripheral Neuropathy 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy resulted in study treatment discontinuation for 3 patients each across 
treatment arms. PMN resulted in study treatment discontinuation for 2 patients in the CHOP arm. 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy resulted in a dose reduction for 11 patients (5%) in the A+CHP arm and 
4 patients (2%) in the CHOP arm, and PMN for 4 patients (2%) in the A+CHP arm and 8 patients (4%) 
in the CHOP arm. Peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy also resulted in a dose reduction for 1 patient in 
the A+CHP arm. Muscular weakness, autonomic neuropathy, and paraesthesia resulted in a dose 
reduction for 1 patient each in the CHOP arm.

Among patients with at least 1 treatment emergent PN (SMQ) event of any grade, first onset was 
reported at a median of 9.1 weeks (range, 0-21 weeks) for the A+CHP arm and at a median of 6.1 
weeks (range, 0-24 weeks) for the CHOP arm. The median time to onset corresponded to 
approximately Cycle 3 for the A+CHP arm and approximately Cycle 2 for the CHOP arm. First onset of 
the highest (worst) grade PN event was reported at a median of 10.0 weeks (range, 0-40 weeks) for 
the A+CHP arm and at a median of 6.5 weeks (range, 0-30 weeks) for the CHOP arm.

Resolution or Improvement of Peripheral Neuropathy 
Among patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event, resolution was reported for 58 
patients (50%) in the A+CHP arm and 79 patients (64%) in the CHOP arm, and improvement for 14 
patients in the A+CHP arm and 15 patients in the CHOP arm (12% each) at last follow-up. Resolution 
of PN events was reported at a median of 17.0 weeks (range, 0-195 weeks) and improvement at a 
median of 8.1 weeks (range, 3-84 weeks) for the A+CHP arm and at a median of 11.4 weeks (range, 
0-220 weeks) and 7.6 weeks (range, 2-101 weeks) for the CHOP arm, respectively. At the time of last 
follow-up, PN was reported to be ongoing for 61 patients (52%) in the A+CHP arm and 45 patients 
(36%) in the CHOP arm, and the majority of ongoing PN events were Grade 1. Grade 3 PN was 
reported for 2 patients in the A+CHP arm and 1 patient in the CHOP arm. Updated results for the 
resolution of PN events show a resolution in PN events of 54%. The median time to resolution of PN 
events was 19 weeks. 
Febrile Neutropenia 
A total of 41 subjects (18%) on the A+CHP arm versus 33 subjects (15%) on the CHOP arm 
experienced treatment-emergent febrile neutropenia. On both treatment arms, the majority of 
subjects who had febrile neutropenia had Grade 3 events (36/41 [88%] for A+CHP versus 26/33 
[79%] for CHOP); Grade 4 events were reported for 5/41 subjects (12%) on the A+CHP arm versus 
6/33 subjects (18%) on the CHOP arm. One Grade 5 event was reported on the CHOP arm. 
For the 41 subjects on the A+CHP arm who had at least 1 event of febrile neutropenia, the median 
time to onset of the first event was 1.9 weeks (range, 1 to 23), which was similar to the median time 
to onset for the 33 subjects on the CHOP arm who had at least 1 febrile neutropenia event (median of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020

1.6 weeks [range, 1 to 23]). With the exception of the single fatal event of febrile neutropenia 
reported for a subject on the CHOP arm, all events of febrile neutropenia resolved. The median time to 
resolution was similar for both treatment arms (0.9 weeks [range, 0 to 2] for the A+CHP arm versus 
0.9 weeks [range, 0 to 3] for the CHOP arm). 
Table 49 Summary of febrile neutropenia adverse events (safety analysis set) 
Impact of Primary Prophylaxis with G-CSF on Febrile Neutropenia 
The use of G-CSF according to institutional guidelines was allowed per protocol for the management of 
subjects who developed neutropenia. After enrollment of approximately 65% of study participants, the 
IDMC recommended that Seattle Genetics remind investigators to use prophylactic growth factor 
support per ASCO guidelines. G-CSF primary prophylaxis was defined as administration of 
pegfilgrastim or filgrastim on Day 1 or 8 of Cycle 1 for an indication of “prophylaxis” on the case report 
form (CRF). 
G-CSF primary prophylaxis was administered to 75 subjects (34%) on the A+CHP treatment arm and 
61 subjects (27%) on the CHOP arm. Febrile neutropenia at any time during treatment was reported 
for 16% of A+CHP subjects who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis compared with 20% of subjects 
who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis. Similar results were reported for the CHOP arm (11% 
versus 16%). Grade 3 or higher neutropenia was reported for 13% of A+CHP subjects who received G-
CSF primary prophylaxis versus 45% of subjects who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
Similar results were reported for the CHOP arm (13% versus 42%).

Table 51– Study SGN35-014: Treatment-Emergent Neutropenia, Anaemia, 
Thrombocytopenia (Safety Population) 
At least 1 dose modification for neutropenia was reported for 16 patients (7%) in the A+CHP arm and 
11 patients (5%) in the CHOP arm. A dose delay was the most commonly reported dose modification 
for neutropenia across treatment arms and was reported for 12 patients (5%) in the A+CHP arm and 9 
patients (4%) in the CHOP arm. Neutropenia resulted in dose delay and dose reduction but was not 
reported as a cause of study treatment discontinuation. 
The number of patients with neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia per grade was overall 
comparable between the treatment arms. 
Immunogenicity: Antidrug Antibody Status 
Immunogenicity-evaluable patients were defined as the patients who had a baseline and at least 1 
post-baseline assessment for ADA (Safety population Immunogenicity-evaluable patients).

Samples for ADA assessment were available for 205 patients of the 226 patients randomized to the 
A+CHP arm; samples were missing for 18 subjects and 3 subjects from the ITT population did not 
receive the study treatment. A total of 205 patients in the A+CHP arm had a baseline and at least 1 
post-baseline assessment for ADA (Immunogenicity-evaluable patients). At baseline, 184 patients 
(81%) were ADA negative and 21 patients (9%) were confirmed ADA positive. 
Table 52 Study SGN35-014: ADA (Safety Population; Immunogenicity Evaluable Patients) 
No notable differences were observed with respect to AE reporting between transiently ATA-positive 
and ATA-negative subjects. The low number of persistently-ATA positive subjects (n=1) precludes 
interpretation of the data. 
Infusion-Related Reactions 
Routine premedication for IRRs was not to be administered before the first dose of brentuximab 
vedotin or vincristine. Patients who experienced an IRR were to be premedicated before subsequent 
infusions. Overall, 10 subjects (4%) on the A+CHP arm and 13 subjects (6%) on the CHOP arm 
experienced IRRs. On both arms, the majority of IRRs were < Grade 3 in severity (80% and 100% for 
A+CHP versus CHOP, respectively). Brentuximab vedotin IRRs were reported for 5 subjects (2%) on 
the A+CHP arm. Three subjects had IRRs at Cycle 1, 1 subject had an IRR at Cycle 2, and 1 subject 
had an IRR at Cycle 6. None of the 5 subjects who experienced a brentuximab vedotin IRR tested 
positive for ATA at baseline. A total of 3 subjects (1%) experienced IRRs to vincristine. IRRs to 
cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin were reported for 13 subjects (3%) and 14 subjects (3%), 
respectively.

resulted in premature discontinuation of drug regimen, a dose modification, or other therapeutic 
intervention were reported as TEAEs.  
At least 1 post-baseline Grade 3 haematology value was reported for 63 patients (28%) in the A+CHP 
arm and 69 patients (31%) in the CHOP arm, and at least 1 Grade 4 haematology value for 5 patients

Vital Signs and Physical Findings 
Clinically significant findings pertaining to physical examinations and vital signs data were reported as 
TEAEs. An improved ECOG performance status of -1 was reported for 37 patients (17%) in the A+CHP 
arm and 32 patients (14%) in the CHOP arm; an improved ECOG performance status of -2 was 
reported for 3% of patients in each treatment arm. 
Supportive studies 
Safety results are presented for the 2 supportive studies of brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
CHP and as monotherapy in adult patients with CD30+ PTCL. 
Study SGN35-011:  
A phase 1, open-label, 3-arm, dose finding study evaluating the safety and activity of sequential and 
combination frontline treatment approaches of brentuximab vedotin with either CHP or CHOP in 
patients with previously untreated CD30+ mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms. (See also Dose response 
study). 
A total of 26 treatment-naïve patients with CD30+ PTCL were enrolled in the combination treatment 
portion of the study. Six patients were enrolled in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort and the 
MTD was not exceeded at the dose of A+CHP 1.8 mg/kg. Patients received 6 cycles of A+CHP, 
administered every 3 weeks. Responders could then receive an additional 8 to 10 cycles of 
brentuximab vedotin up to a maximum of 16 cycles.  
TEAEs of any grade reported for the combination treatment arm included peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (69% of patients) nausea (65%), fatigue and diarrhoea (58% each), alopecia (54%), 
dyspnoea (46%), constipation (38%), peripheral oedema (35%), and anaemia, chills, febrile 
neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, and myalgia (31% each). Dyspnoea of any grade was 
reported for 12 patients and considered related to brentuximab vedotin for 4 patients. At least 1 Grade 
3 or higher TEAE was reported for 19 patients (73%) and included febrile neutropenia (31% of 
patients), neutropenia (23%), anaemia (15%), and pulmonary embolism (12%).  
No treatment-related mortality was observed. SAEs were reported for 50% of patients. SAEs reported 
for more than 1 patient were febrile neutropenia, reported for 8 patients (31%) and pyrexia and 
cardiac failure, reported for 2 patients each (8%). An AE resulted in dose reduction for 9 patients 
(35%), mostly during the maintenance treatment period, and peripheral sensory neuropathy was 
reported as the cause of dose reduction for 7 patients (27%). No IRRs to brentuximab vedotin were 
reported. Treatment-emergent PN was reported for 19 patients (73%) and included a Grade 3 PN 
event for 2 patients. Patients with PN were managed with dose delays and dose reductions. During 
PTFU, PN was reported as either resolved or improved for 18 of the 19 patients in which it was 
reported and resolution of all PN events was reported for 9 patients. 
Study SGN35-012 
Study SGN35-012 was a phase 2, open-label, single arm study of brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) in 
relapsed refractory non- Hodgkin lymphoma. The primary endpoint was ORR with key secondary 
endpoints including safety, correlation of CD30 expression with RR, response duration and PFS. 
Enrolled patients received brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. A planned subset analysis included 35 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL, 
including 22 patients with PTCL-NOS and 13 patients with AITL. The median age of enrolled patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 82/105 
 
 
 
 
was 64 years (range, 33-83 years). Most patients had Stage III or Stage IV disease at the time of 
study entry and had received a median of 2 prior anticancer therapies (range, 1-9). Disease was 
refractory to the most recent therapy for 63% of patients.  
All 35 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL received at least 1 dose of brentuximab vedotin. 
Patients received a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-21 cycles) over a median of 9 weeks (range, 2-78 
weeks) with a longer treatment period reported for patients who responded to the study drug. A 
median of 8.5 cycles (range, 4-21 cycles) was reported for responding patients over a median 
treatment period of 26 weeks (range, 12-78 weeks). At least 1 TEAE of any grade was reported for 32 
patients (91%). The most commonly reported TEAEs of any grade were peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(37% of patients), fatigue (34%), pyrexia (23%), decreased appetite (20%), and diarrhoea, nausea 
(17% each). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported for these 35 patients included neutropenia (14% of 
patients), peripheral sensory neuropathy and hyperkalaemia (9% each), and acute renal failure, 
anaemia, dehydration, disease progression, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, tumour lysis syndrome, 
urinary tract infection (6% each). At least 1 Grade 4 TEAE was reported for 3 patients. The Grade 4 
TEAEs reported were pneumonia, sepsis, hyperkalaemia, lipase increased, confusional state, and 
pulmonary oedema. A treatment-related SAE was reported for 4 patients, which included Grade 5 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and Grade 3 pyrexia, rash and pneumonia. An AE 
resulted in study drug discontinuation for 20% of patients. The AEs that resulted in study drug 
discontinuation included peripheral sensory neuropathy (6% of patients), and ARDS, encephalopathy, 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, pyrexia, and sepsis (3% each). The death of 3 patients was 
reported within 30 days of the last dose of brentuximab vedotin. ARDS was reported as the cause of 
death for 1 patient with refractory AITL as a complication of disease progression and infection. The 
death of the other 2 patients was related to disease progression. The death of 1 patient was reported 
33 days after the last dose of brentuximab vedotin, which was attributed to complications including 
sepsis. The safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of single-agent brentuximab 
vedotin and no new safety signals were identified in patients treated up to 21 cycles. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in PTCL types 
Of the Safety population, 63 A+CHP-treated patients (28%) and 72 CHOP-treated patients (32%) had 
PTCL histological subtypes other than sALCL. Patients with PTCL-NOS represented 29 A+CHP-treated 
patients (13%) and 43 CHOP-treated patients (19%); patients with AITL represented 29 A+CHP-
treated patients (13%) and 24 CHOP-treated patients (11%); patients with ATLL and EATL represented 
2% or less of the treated patient population in both treatment arms, respectively.

Table 57 ECHELON-2: Summary of Demographics and Baseline Subject Characteristics (ITT 
Population) 
Safety Profile 
The overall safety profile of A+CHP and CHOP by patients’ disease subtype (sALCL versus non-sALCL) 
was analysed in a non-randomized comparison. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were in 
A+CHP arm: 35 [56%] non-ALCL patients vs 51 [32%] ALCL patients and CHOP arm: 30 [42%] non-
sALCL patients vs 55 [36%] ALCL patients. 
The difference is driven by a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia and infections. The incidence of 
febrile neutropenia in the A+CHP arm was 17 (27%) non-ALCL patients vs 14 (9%) ALCL patients and 
in the CHOP arm was 14 (19%) non-ALCL patients vs 12 (8%) ALCL patients. The incidence of serious 
infections in the A+CHP arm was 18 (29%) non-ALCL patients vs 19 (12%) ALCL patients and in CHOP 
arm was 10 (14%) non-sALCL patients vs 14 (9%) ALCL patients. 
G-CSF Primary Prophylaxis 
In ECHELON-2, G-CSF primary prophylaxis was recommended after approximately 60% of patients 
were enrolled; therefore only 1/3 of patients in both arms received G-CSF primary prophylaxis 
support.  
In a non-randomized comparison the impact of G-CSG PP on febrile neutropenia was most pronounced 
in non-sALCL patients in the A+CHP arm. A reduction in the incidence of neutropenia with G-CSF 
prophylaxis is seen and G-CSF has limited effect on grade≥ 3 AEs infections and infestations, SAEs, 
and -SAEs febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, (neutropenic) sepsis, pyrexia or infections and infestations 
(SOC)-  in non-sALCL patients. No impact of G-CSF PP was observed in non-sALCL patients in CHOP 
arm. With G-CSF PP, the incidence of febrile neutropenia in non-sALCL patients is the same in both 
arms (25%) and <15% in sALCL patients in both arms. 
Non-hematologic Toxicity 
Additionally, the safety profile for non-haematological toxicity was comparable between disease 
subtypes and treatment arms. No difference in PN incidence was observed between arms or disease 
subtypes. Peripheral sensory neuropathy was experienced by 48% of sALCL patients and 37% non-
sALCL patients in the A+CHP arm; in the CHOP arm, 42% of sALCL patients and 38% of non-sALCL 
patients experienced peripheral sensory neuropathy, with 2 patients in each treatment arm 
discontinuing treatment due to peripheral neuropathy.

A total of 139 patients in the ECHELON-2 ITT population, 69 patients in the A+CHP arm and 70 
patients in the CHOP arm were aged 65 years or older. Within this age group, a median age of 70.0 
years (range, 65-85 years) was reported for the A+CHP arm and 71.0 years (range, 65-83 years) for 
the CHOP arm. Within this age group, an ECOG performance status of 1 was reported for 25 patients 
(36%) in the A+CHP arm and 29 patients (41%) in the CHOP arm and an ECOG performance status of 
2 for 15 patients (22%) in the A+CHP arm and 13 patients (19%) in the CHOP arm. Subgroup 
analyses were performed by age group (≥65 years versus <65 years) to compare the incidence of 
TEAEs of any grade, the incidence of febrile neutropenia, and the impact of G-CSF primary prophylaxis 
on febrile neutropenia.

Impact of Primary Prophylaxis on Febrile Neutropenia by Age Group: ECHELON-2 
The results of the assessment performed to compare the impact of G-CSF primary prophylaxis on the 
safety profile of patients 65 years of age or older suggest that G-CSF primary prophylaxis was 
generally associated with an improved safety profile regardless of age (Table 44). The trend was 
observed across treatment arms. 
Among the 33 patients in the A+CHP arm and the 28 patients in the CHOP arm 65 years of age or 
older who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis, a trend of improved safety outcomes was observed 
compared with the outcomes for patients in the same age group who did not receive G-CSF primary 
prophylaxis. Neutropenia of any grade, Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, febrile neutropenia during the 
study, and Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for a smaller proportion of patients in both 
treatment arms who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis than those who did not receive G-CSF 
primary prophylaxis.

Post marketing experience 
Brentuximab vedotin was first approved in the US on 19 August 2011, its International Birth Date 
(IBD) in the US and has since been granted marketing authorization in 72 countries /regions. As of 18 
February 2019, the estimated cumulative exposure to brentuximab vedotin commercial product was 
approximately 24,196 patients in the US and Canada, and approximately 34,005 patients in the rest of 
world (Latin America, Japan, North Asia). The cumulative exposure globally to commercial brentuximab 
vedotin since its initial launch is estimated to be 58,201 patients. A summary is presented of ADRs by 
SOC received through spontaneous reporting sources as of 18 February 2019, including reports from 
regulatory authorities and literature articles from both healthcare professionals and non-healthcare 
professionals.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure 
Safety was presented from ECHELON-2 a randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-
comparator, multicenter study in patients with previously untreated PTCL who received A+CHP or 
CHOP. The ECHELON-2 safety population included all patients who received any amount of 
brentuximab vedotin or any component of CHOP. Treatment arm was determined according to the 
actual treatment received, regardless of the randomization treatment assignment. The safety 
population consisted of 223 patients in the A+CHP arm and 226 patients in the CHOP arm.

Patients in both treatment arms could receive 6 or 8 cycles of study treatment. A median of 6 cycles 
(range 1 to 8 cycles) was reported for both treatment arms, administered over a similar median 
duration of approximately 18 weeks (range 3.0 to 34 weeks). In total, 70% of patients in the A+CHP 
arm and 62% of patients in the CHOP arm received 6 cycles, 18% resp. 19% received 8 cycles of 
study treatment (see Study design under Clinical Efficacy section).  
The PTCL subtypes that were allowed in the study were sALCL (ALK+ IPI score ≥2 and all ALK-), PTCL-
NOS, AITL, ATTL, EATL and HSTCL. Most of the randomized patients had advanced stage and 
intermediate-risk disease as is typical of this patient population at the time of clinical presentation.  
The median age of randomized patients was 58 years (range, 18-85 years for the A+CHP arm and 18-
83 years for the CHOP arm); 31% of patients were aged 65 years or older. Most patients had an ECOG 
0 or 1, an ECOG performance status of 2 was reported for 51 patients (23%) in the A+CHP arm and 47 
patients (21%) in the CHOP arm.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
In the ECHELON-2 trial almost all patients experienced 1 TEAE of any grade in both treatment arms 
(99% A+CHP vs 98% CHOP). The most common reported TEAE in both regimens were nausea, 
peripheral sensory neuropath, diarrhoea, neutropenia, constipation, alopecia, pyrexia, and vomiting 
occurring in more than 25% of the subjects. It is noted that the occurrence of TEAE GI adverse events 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) is higher in the A+CHP arm compared to CHOP, which is partly reflected 
in the higher use of anti-emetics as co-medication (e.g. ondansetron hydrochloride use 48% A+CHP vs 
40% in CHOP). Diarrhoea was more commonly reported as treatment-emergent in A+CHP subjects 
(38% versus 20%) and assessed as treatment related in 16% (brentuximab vedotin) or 7% 
(vincristine related). The incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment emergent diarrhoea was higher in 
the A+CHP arm (6%) then CHP arm (1%). The Grade 3 diarrhoea events lasted a median of 4.5 days 
(range, 2 to 18 days), this however apparently did not lead to dose delay, dose reduction or 
discontinuation of the study drugs. GI events are considered manageable with existing standards of 
care. At least 1 TEAEs Grade 3 or higher occurred in a similar frequency in both treatment arms (66 vs 
65%) and at least 1 drug-related SAE was reported for 39% (A+CHP) and 38% (CHOP) of the 
subjects. There are slightly more subjects with any ≥Grade 3 brentuximab vedotin or vincristine-
related event (116 (52%) vs 104 (46%)) as well as SAEs related to brentuximab vedotin or vincristine 
(58 (26%) vs 45 (20%)). In the A+CHP arm, brentuximab vedotin-related ≥ Grade 3 AEs reported for 
≥10% of subjects were neutropenia (30%) and febrile neutropenia (16%). On the CHOP arm, 
vincristine-related ≥ Grade 3 AEs reported for ≥10% of subjects were also neutropenia (27%) and 
febrile neutropenia (12%). Febrile neutropenia (14% of patients in the A+CHP arm and 12% of 
patients in the CHOP arm) was the most commonly reported SAE across treatment arms.  
As of the August 15, 2018 cut-off date, a total of 123 deaths were reported, 50 on the A+CHP arm and 
73 on the CHOP arm. Of the 50 deaths on the A+CHP arm, 36 were disease related, 10 were not 
disease related, and disease relationship was unknown for 4 subjects. Of the 73 deaths on the CHOP 
arm, 58 were disease related, 7 were not disease related, and disease relationship was unknown for 8 
subjects. Eight subjects (4%) on the A+CHP arm and 13 subjects (6%) on the CHOP arm died within 
30 days of the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen. Approximately half of the deaths 
within 30 days of the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen were disease related 
(11/21; 52%). Grade 5 TEAE occurred in 4% (8 cases) in A+CHP subjects and 7 % (16 cases) in the 
CHOP treated subjects. In A+CHP subjects adverse events leading to death were acute kidney injury, 
cardiac arrest, peripheral T cell lymphoma unspecified, pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, pulmonary 
cavitation, sepsis and ventricular fibrillation (1 case each). In the CHOP arm anaplastic large T cell 
lymphoma was the most common AE leading to death (8 cases), followed by sepsis and multiple organ 
dysfunction.

Dose delay was the most frequently reported dose modification due to AEs for patients across 
treatment arms. Doses of brentuximab vedotin were delayed in 59/223 subjects (26%) on the A+CHP 
arm with the most common reasons neutropenia (5%), pneumonia (3%), and pyrexia (2%). Doses of 
vincristine were delayed because of AEs in 28/226 subjects (12%) on the CHOP arm due to 
neutropenia (4%), and leukopenia and pyrexia (1% each). An AE resulted in dose reduction of 
brentuximab vedotin in 21/223 subjects (9%) and a reduction of vincristine occurred in 24/226 
subjects (11%). The most common reasons for dose reductions on the A+CHP arm were peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (5%) and peripheral motor neuropathy (2%). An AE resulted in premature study 
drug discontinuation for 14% A+CHP patients (6%) and 15 CHOP patients (7%), two subjects on each 
arm discontinued treatment due to peripheral sensory neuropathy.  
The safety results of 2 supportive studies of brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP and as 
monotherapy in adult patients with CD30+ PTCL showed a similar safety profile consistent with that for 
ECHELON-2 for adult patients with CD30+ PTCL treated with A+CHP in the frontline setting and 
brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy in the relapsed or refractory setting.  
Adverse of special interest included peripheral neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia and other 
haematological abnormalities (anaemia, thrombocytopenia) hepatotoxicity, infections and secondary 
malignancies.  
Peripheral Neuropathy 
In the clinical trial of Adcetris as combination therapy with CHP, treatment emergent neuropathy 
occurred in 52% of the population; peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 9% of patients. Among 
patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy, the median follow up time from end of treatment 
until last evaluation was approximately 177 weeks. At the time of last evaluation, 64% who 
experienced peripheral neuropathy had resolution or improvement of their peripheral neuropathy 
symptoms. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of peripheral neuropathy events 
was 19.0 weeks (ranged from 0 weeks to 205 weeks). 
A similar frequency and severity of treatment-related PN events were reported across treatment arms 
(50% of patients in the A+CHP arm and 49% of patients in the CHOP arm). Most of the PN events 
across treatment arms were Grade 1. Peripheral neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 1%, 
dose reductions in 7% and dose delays in <1% of patients. For patients who experienced peripheral 
neuropathy the median time of onset was 9.1 weeks. Patients who discontinued due to peripheral 
neuropathy received a median of 5 doses of A+CHP before discontinuation of one or more agents. 
Among patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent PN (SMQ) event, resolution was reported for 63 
patients (54%) in the A+CHP arm and 80 patients (65%) in the CHOP arm. Improvements were 
reported for 12 (10%) patients in the A+CHP arm and 15 (12%) patients in the CHOP arm. At the time 
of last follow-up, PN was ongoing for 56 patients (48%) in the A+CHP arm and 44 patients (35%) in 
the CHOP arm, and the majority of ongoing PN events were Grade 1. The incidence of PN in ECHELON-
2 was lower than the monotherapy trials AETHERA and ALCANZA (each 67%) and it is noted that the 
cases of PN less commonly lead to dose modifications. The median onset of PN was earlier for the 
CHOP patients (9.1 weeks vs. 6.1 weeks). In conclusion, the rate and severity as well as the resolution 
rate is in line with that expected of brentuximab vedotin therapy and similar to CHOP treatment.  
Neutropenia 
Treatment-emergent febrile neutropenia was reported in both arms (18% A+CHP and 15% CHOP). In 
both treatment arms, the majority of subjects who had febrile neutropenia had Grade 3 events (36/41 
[88%] for A+CHP versus 26/33 [79%] for CHOP; the median time to onset was in the first cycle of 
treatment (1.9 resp. 1.6 weeks). Anaemia and thrombocytopenia in the A+CHP arm were observed

EMA/CHMP/213609/2020  
Page 92/105 
 
 
 
slightly more frequent, though comparable to the CHOP arm. Febrile neutropenia resulted in dose 
modifications for a small proportion (2% to 3%) of patients.  
G-CSF prophylaxis 
G-CSF primary prophylaxis was allowed per protocol and administered to 75 subjects (34%) on the 
A+CHP treatment arm and 61 subjects (27%) on the CHOP arm. In a non-randomized comparison 
between subjects with and without primary G-CSF prophylaxis, the prophylaxis severely reduced 
neutropenia rates, however appeared to have a limited effect on the reduction of febrile neutropenia, 
(Gr ≥3) infections and SAEs. Refer to section safety in PTCL types for more details. The SmPC 
recommends the administration of G-CSF primary prophylaxis for all patients being treated with 
A+CHP, beginning at Cycle 1. 
Immunogenicity  
49 of 205 ATA-evaluable subjects (24%) in the A+CHP arm were ATA positive, among which 5 (5/49, 
10%) positive for nATA. Only 2 cases were persistently positive for ATA post baseline. No notable 
differences were observed with respect to AE reporting between transiently ATA-positive and ATA-
negative subjects.   
Infusion related reactions (IRRs) occurred in 10 subjects (4%) on the A+CHP arm and 13 subjects 
(6%) on the CHOP arm with the majority of IRRs were < Grade 3 in severity. None of the 5 subjects 
who experienced a brentuximab vedotin IRR tested positive for ATA at baseline. The safety information 
included in the SmPC section 4.4 is considered sufficient. 
Other events of special interest 
The incidence for hepatotoxicity (9%) was comparable to the observed incidences for brentuximab 
vedotin monotherapy (CTCL 11%, HL at risk of relapse 7%) and in combination with AVD (untreated 
HL 19%). The same applies for infections (52%, compared to monotherapy (60 % HL at risk of 
relapse; CTCL 44%) and in combination with AVD (previously untreated HL 55%)).  The reporting 
rates of malignancies (4%) was comparable in other studies with monotherapy (HL at risk for relapse 
2%, CTCL 6%) and in combination with AVD (previously untreated HL 1.5%)). In these reports, the 
progression of underlying lymphoma might be included. The actual incidence of secondary malignancy 
is not yet known- see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
Special populations 
A total of 139 patients in the ECHELON-2 ITT population, 69 patients (31%) in the A+CHP arm and 70 
patients (31%) in the CHOP arm were aged 65 years or older. Subgroup analyses were performed by 
age group (≥65 years versus <65 years) to compare the incidence of TEAEs of any grade, the 
incidence of febrile neutropenia, and the impact of G-CSF primary prophylaxis on febrile neutropenia. 
As expected, a higher incidence of TEAEs for patients aged 65 years and older was observed.  The 
overall incidence and profile of TEAEs for both the A+CHP and CHOP treatment arms was generally 
similar regardless of age; however, in both treatment arms, the incidence of ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs and 
SAEs was higher in subjects ≥65 years. The incidence of Grade 3 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and 
Grade 3 or higher infections and infestations was lower in subjects aged <65 years. In both treatment 
arms, the median time to onset and the median time to resolution was similar, regardless of age. 
Among the 33 patients in the A+CHP arm and the 28 patients in the CHOP arm ≥65 years who 
received G-CSF primary prophylaxis, a trend of improved safety outcomes was observed, comparable 
with the outcomes for patients in the same age group who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
The AE profile in elderly is in line with the previous studies of brentuximab vedotin and adequately 
covered in the SmPC.

Safety in PTCL types 
In non-sALCL patients (thus including PTCL-NOS and AITL) the safety profile of A+CHP can be 
considered more severe compared to CHOP, as illustrated by more≥ grade 3 TEAE, more SAEs and a 
higher percentage of discontinuations due to AEs. This difference appears mostly due to AEs in blood 
and lymphatic disorders, GI disorders, infections and infestations and metabolism/nutrition disorders. 
Moreover, the safety of A+CHP in non-sALCL patients can be considered more severe compared to the 
ITT. Notably, non-sALCL patients were older than sALCL patients (non-sALCL patients 48% ≥65 s vs 
sALCL 23% ≥65 years). The uncertainty whether the safety profile (AEs in blood and lymphatic 
disorders, GI disorders, infections and infestations and metabolism/nutrition disorders) of A+CHP is 
more pronounced over CHOP in non-sALCL PTCL and can all be mitigated by G-CSF prophylaxis in 
clinical practice was discussed with experts (see Additional expert consultation below).  
Safety in supportive studies 
The safety profile for A+CHP in the Phase 1 study SGN35-011 was overall comparable to that in 
ECHELON-2 except for a higher rate of patients discontinuing treatment due to an AE (23% vs 4%). 
The AEs leading to discontinuations were similar to those in the ECHELON-2 trial. 
The different study design and treatment used in the supportive study SGN35-012 does not allow for a 
conclusion of the safety profile of A+CHP. However, the safety data for the 35 patients with PTCL 
appears to be in line with the established safety profile of brentuximab vedotin monotherapy. 
Additional expert consultations  
The SAG- O was consulted on the following question on Clinical Safety: 
- 
Please discuss whether a differential safety profile depending on PTCL subtypes is plausible. 
The SAG experts agreed that differences in safety across PTCL entities would not be expected.  
It should be noted that non-sALCL patients were older than sALCL patients (non-sALCL patients 
48% ≥65 s vs sALCL 23% ≥65 years); a plausible correlation could be to older age of patients and 
not to histology and nevertheless the numbers in terms of AEs are too small to draw any 
conclusions. It was also considered that haematological toxicity can easily be managed by adding 
G-CSF, as primary prophylaxis. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile for patients with the combination of Adcetris with CHP arm was generally consistent 
with the known AE profile for patients treated with brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
chemotherapy. No new safety signals were identified.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4,  4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
In accordance with articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, the MAH included the 
results of user testing of the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) during review the marketing 
authorisation application for ADCETRIS in 2012. An assessment of all changes made to the 
Patient Information Leaflet, since the original application, was submitted during review of the 
most recently approved new indication for Adcetris (Procedure EMEA/H/C/002455/II/55). 
- 
This variation application seeks approval for the use of ADCETRIS in combination with 
chemotherapy for patients with previously untreated CD30+ PTCL. The safety profile in this 
population is similar to that already approved, and the changes to the PIL are minor. 
Furthermore, there have been no changes to the layout of the PIL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a group of heterogeneous malignant lymphoproliferative 
disorders that originate from post-thymic T cells or mature natural killer (NK) cells. Systemic 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) may be ALK- 9.4%, or ALK+ 6.4) and has a high expression of 
CD30 (the target of Adcetris) at ≥75% of the tumour cells.  
The acclaimed indication is: ADCETRIS in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
prednisone (CHP) is indicated for adult patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (sALCL). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment of newly diagnosed PTCL patients depends on subtype, age, IPI and comorbidities. Most 
PTCL patients are treated in a trial. Outside trials, the recommended first line therapy for patients with 
PTCL-NOS, AITL and ALCL is CHOP.  
There is an unmet need across PTCL entities due to the low long-term survival rates and the toxicity of 
the treatment regimens.

Page 99/105 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study in this application is ECHELON-2 (SGN35-014), a randomized (1:1), double-blind 
controlled study of 6-8 cycles brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and CHP (A+CHP) versus 6-8 cycles of 
CHOP for treatment-naïve CD30 positive PTCL patients. sALCL (ALK+ IPI score ≥2 and all ALK-), PTCL-
NOS, AITL, ATTL, EATL and HSTCL were allowed in the study. The protocol stipulated that 75± 5% of 
the enrolled subjects needed to have a diagnosis of sALCL. The ECHELON-2 study serves to fulfil a 
commitment for additional pharmacovigilance activity as agreed upon at time of the MAA (Category 3, 
MEA-015).   
The ITT analysis set consisted of 452 subjects, 226 in the A+CHP arm and 226 in the CHOP arm. Most 
patients had sALCL (70%; ALK- in 48% and ALK+ in 22%). The other PTCLs studied were PTCL-NOS 
(16%), AITL 12%, ATLL (n=7; 2%) and EATL (n=3;1%). No HSTCL patients were included. 
As supportive studies, a dose escalation study (SGN35-011) to evaluate toxicity of A+CHP (n=26) and 
sequential to CHOP (n=13) was submitted. A phase 2 study (SGN35-012) of brentuximab vedotin 
monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (AITL (n=13) and PTCL-NOS (n=22)) was also 
submitted. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint PFS per IRF showed a statistically significant advantage of A+CHP over CHOP in 
the overall study population (HR 0.71 [0.54, 0.93], p=0.011). The PFS rates at 12 months is 71.7% 
versus 58.2% and at 24 months respectively 61.4% versus 47.4%. In a PFS sensitivity analysis 
performed, the PFS HR was 0.76 [0.58,0.99], p=0.0443 with PFS rates at 2 year of 62.3% in the 
A+CHP and 50.9% in the CHOP arm. Thus, the sensitivity analyses support the primary endpoint. 
Key secondary endpoints were tested in a fixed sequence testing procedure and all were statistically 
significant (PFS per IRF in sALCL, CR in total sample, OS in total sample, ORR in total sample). The 
PFS HR in sALCL patients was 0.59 [0.42, 0.84], p=0.0031. The 2-year PFS rates were 68.4% and 
53.9% and the median PFS was 55.7 in the A+CHP arm versus 54.2 months in the CHOP arm.  
PFS is supported by differences in CR rate (68% versus 56%, p=0.0066) and ORR rate (83% versus 
72%, p=0.0032) favoring A+CHP over CHOP. ORR rate is driven by the difference in CRs. The median 
duration response was respectively 52.7 versus 51.4 months. The OS HR was 0.66 [0.46, 0.95], 
p=0.0244 with 27% of the OS events. The median OS was not reached in both arms.  
Efficacy outcomes of the dose finding study SGN35-011 appear supportive for the efficacy observed in 
the pivotal study. In the phase 2 study (SGN35-012) in relapsed refractory AITL and PTCL-NOS 
patients anti-disease activity of brentuximab vedotin was observed.  
Fewer patients received subsequent new anticancer treatment in the A+CHP arm compared to the 
CHOP arm: 65/226 (29%) vs 96/226 (42%) and the estimated subsequent therapy free rate was 
higher in the A+CHP arm compared to the CHOP arm. 
PFS benefit of A+CHP over CHOP is observed in ALK+ (HR: 0.29, nominal p value: 0.01) and ALK- 
sALCL patients (HR: 0.65, nominal p value p = 0.02).  
PFS in sALCL patients is supported by a more favourable CR rate (71% vs 53.2%) and more 
favourable point estimate for OS (HR 0.54 [0.34-0.87]) in a subgroup analysis.  
The study population does not represent the complete CD30+ PTCL target population. It is estimated 
that sALCL constitutes approximately 15% of the PTCLs, but due to the protocol requirement for 75± 
5% sALCL patients in the study, sALCL is overrepresented in the ITT. Notably, the study was not

powered/did not include sufficient numbers of patients to conclude on the benefit of A+CHP in the 
various studied non-sALCL PTCL entities. As a consequence, the indication was limited to focus of 
sALCL patients. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties on the favourable effects of Adcetris in the treatment of patients with 
previously untreated CD30+ sALCL.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The AE profile for patients in the A+CHP arm was generally consistent with the known AE profile for 
patients treated with brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy. No new safety signals 
were identified. In the ECHELON-2 trial almost all patients experienced 1 TEAE of any grade in both 
treatment arms (99% A+CHP vs 98% CHOP). The most common reported TEAE in both regimens were 
nausea, peripheral sensory neuropath, diarrhoea, neutropenia, constipation, alopecia, pyrexia, and 
vomiting, occurring in more than 25% of the subjects. 
At least 1 TEAEs ≥Grade 3 occurred in a similar frequency in both treatment arms (66 vs 65%) and at 
least 1 drug-related SAE was reported for 39% (A+CHP) and 38% (CHOP) of the subjects. On both 
study arms, treatment-related (either brentuximab or vincristine) ≥ Grade 3 AEs reported for ≥10% of 
subjects was neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. 
Doses of brentuximab vedotin were delayed due to an AE in 59/223 subjects (26%) and doses of 
vincristine were delayed because of AEs in 28/226 subjects (12%). AEs resulting in a dose reduction of 
brentuximab vedotin in 21/223 subjects (9%) and a reduction of vincristine occurred in 24/226 
subjects (11%). AEs resulted in premature study drug discontinuation for 14 A+CHP patients (6%) and 
15 CHOP patients (7%). 
A similar frequency and severity of treatment-related peripheral neuropathy (PN) events were reported 
across treatment arms (50% of patients in the A+CHP arm and 49% in the CHOP arm). Most of PN 
events across treatment arms were Grade 1. PN (sensory and motor) resulted in a dose modification in 
7% (16 cases) across treatment arms, mainly dose reduction. Two subjects on each arm discontinued 
treatment due to peripheral sensory neuropathy. 
Treatment-emergent febrile neutropenia was reported in both arms (18% A+CHP and 15% CHOP). On 
both treatment arms, the majority of subjects who had febrile neutropenia had Grade 3 events (36/41 
[88%] for A+CHP versus 26/33 [79%] for febrile neutropenia resulted in dose modifications for a small 
proportion (2% to 3%) of patients. G-CSF primary prophylaxis was administered to 75 subjects (34%) 
on the A+CHP treatment arm and 61 subjects (27%) on the CHOP arm.  
In both treatment arms, the incidence of ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs and SAEs; Grade 3 neutropenia, febrile 
neutropenia and ≥Grade 3 infections was higher in subjects ≥65 years. The AE profile in elderly is in 
line with the previous studies of brentuximab vedotin and adequately described in the SmPC. 
The type of AEs of the subgroups of sALCL and non-sALCL are in alignment with that of the overall 
safety population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study demonstrated a clinically relevant effect in PFS of A+CHP over CHOP in the overall 
study population (PFS HR 0.71 [0.54, 0.93], p=0.011), best represented by PFS event rates at 1 year 
(71.7% versus 58.2%) and 2 years (61.4% versus 47.4%), reflected by plateau formation in the KM 
curves. The sensitivity analyses showed the PFS effect to be robust and PFS results are supported by 
the key secondary endpoints CR rate and OS benefit with a HR of 0.66. These results were considered 
as driven by the predominant sALCL disease group. The PFS in sALCL patients (70% of the ITT) was a 
key secondary endpoint and the first to be tested in a hierarchical testing procedure. This analysis 
confirmed the PFS benefit of A+CHP over CHOP in sALCL patients (HR 0.59 [0.42, 0.84], p=0.0031). 
These outcomes are supported by CR and OS data in sALCL patients.  
On safety, in the overall study population A+CHP showed an incidence, type, and severity of AEs 
comparable to CHOP and the toxicity of A+CHP is considered generally manageable.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The HR for PFS benefit of A+CHP over CHOP in sALCL patients was 0.59 [0.42, 0.84], p=0.0031 which 
is a clinically relevant outcome and is supported by CR and OS data in sALCL patients.  
The safety profile is in line with the well-known profile of Adcetris in combination with chemotherapy 
and is considered generally manageable.  
An update on Overall Survival will be provided in the context of the follow up of MEA015; a final study 
report is expected by Q1 2021.

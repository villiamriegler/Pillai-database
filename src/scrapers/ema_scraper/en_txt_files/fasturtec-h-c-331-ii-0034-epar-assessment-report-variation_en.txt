2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rasburicase  is  a  recombinant  urate-oxidase  enzyme  able  to  convert  uric  acid  into  allantoin,  a  water 
soluble  product,  easily  excreted  in  the  urine.  In  this  way  rasburicase  is  expected  to  reduce 
hyperuricemia  and  prevent  development  of  a  tumour  lysis  syndrome  during  cytoreductive 
chemotherapy, a life-threatening complication in this patient population. Indeed, the acute increase of 
uric  acid  plasma  levels  following  quick  and  massive  lysis  of  malignant  cells  may  lead  to  renal 
impairment due to precipitation of crystal of uric acids in renal tubules. 
Fasturtec  (rasburicase),  1.5  mg/ml  powder  and  solvent  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  is 
administered  at  a  dose  of  0.20  mg/kg/day  as  a  30  minute  intravenous  infusion  in  50  ml of  a  sodium 
chloride  9  mg/ml  (0.9%)  solution.  The  duration  of  treatment  may  be  up  to  7  days,  based  upon 
adequate monitoring of uric acid levels in plasma and clinical judgment.  
Fasturtec was granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 23 February 2001 for the treatment and 
prophylaxis  of  acute  hyperuricaemia,  in  order  to  prevent  acute  renal  failure,  in  patients  with 
haematological malignancy with a high tumour burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage 
at  initiation  of  chemotherapy.  Safety  and  efficacy  of  rasburicase  have  been  assessed  in  studies  in 
adults and paediatric patients (<18 years).  
On  6  December  2011,  the  MAH  submitted  the  results  of  a  paediatric  phase  IV  study  (L9436)  for 
rasburicase  (Fasturtec),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended, 
on medicinal products for paediatric use (P46-042). 
On  16  February  2012,  the  CHMP  adopted  the  conclusions  on  this  study,  requiring  supplementary 
information as well as an update of the product information. 
In  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  has  submitted  the  requested  supplementary  information  and 
proposed to update section 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC to clarify the age range of paediatric patients. 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study L9436, a Phase IV, multicentre, non-comparative, open-label study of rasburicase in paediatric 
(<18  years)  patients  with  acute  hyperuricemia  before  or  during  chemotherapy  for  hematologic 
malignancies, or who have risk factors for development of tumour lysis. 
This  multicenter  study  was  conducted  at  3  centers  in  Brazil.  The  study  started  on  16  February  2006 
and ended on 30 October 2006. 
  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  efficacy  of  rasburicase  in  treating  hyperuricemia  and 
protecting  renal  function (through  evaluation  of  serum  creatinine  levels) in  patients  at  risk  of  tumour 
lysis syndrome during chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.  
Secondary  objectives  consisted  of  evaluation  of  safety  of  rasburicase  as  well  as  evaluation  of  other 
laboratory  parameters  (i.e.,  calcium,  phosphorus,  potassium,  haemoglobin,  platelet  and  leucocyte 
counts), some of which are altered in case of tumour lysis syndrome. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/647431/2012  
Page 3/12
 
 
 
 
 
Since  only  a  descriptive  analysis  was  planned,  no  specific  methodology  for  defining  the  sample  size 
was applied. A total of 40 patients were initially planned. 
Patients  allowed  to  be  enrolled  in  the  study  were  subjects  <  18  years  old  with  acute  hyperuricemia 
(uric acid > 8.0 mg/dL) before or during chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, or who had risk 
factors  for  development  of  tumour  lysis  (lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  >  2  x  upper  limit  of  normality 
and/or  serum  creatinine  >  upper  limit  of  normality  and/or  leukocyte  count  above  50,000/mm3  in 
patients with leukaemia). Patients with hypersensibility to uricase or excipients or with known history 
of G6PD deficiency were excluded. 
  Treatments 
All patients received the best anticancer treatment according to each investigator. During 1-7 days of 
treatment,  patients  received  rasburicase  0.20  mg/kg/day,  once  daily,  as  a  30  minutes  intravenous 
infusion. Rasburicase doses every 12 hours were allowed during the first 72 hours of chemotherapy in 
case  of  persistent  hyperuricemia  or  if  the  patient  was  considered  at  significant  risk  of  tumour  lysis 
complications.  The  extension  of  treatment  (up  to  7  days)  was  assessed  according  to  the  uric  acid 
levels.  Patients  were  then  followed  for  4  weeks  after  last  medication  dose.  Two  post-treatment 
evaluations were planned: at 24-48 hours and 28 ± 3 days after last rasburicase dose.  
Patients  should  have  discontinued  previous  hypouricemic  treatment  before  starting  rasburicase.  All 
patients  should  receive  proper  hydration  according  to  the  clinical  practice;  alkaline  hydration  (with 
NaHCO3) was deemed at discretion of the investigator. Patients who had leucophoresis or transfusion 
with  exchange  of  hyperleucocytosis  within  12  hours  after  receiving  rasburicase  dose  were  allowed  to 
receive an additional dose of study drug. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  endpoint  was  of  evaluation  of  uric  acid  levels  and  renal  protection  (through  serum  creatinin 
levels)  after  treatment  with  rasburicase  in  patients  with  hyperuricemia  and/or  at  risk  of  tumour  lysis 
syndrome. Uric acid levels and renal function were evaluated at 24-48 hours and 28 ± 3 days after last 
medication dose. 
Secondary  endpoints  were  evaluation  of  safety  and  of  several  laboratory  parameters  (i.e.,  calcium, 
phosphorus, potassium, haemoglobin, platelet and white cell counts), some of which are mainly altered 
during a tumour lysis syndrome (i.e., hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia). 
  Statistical Methods 
The  continuous  variables  were  described  by  medians,  means,  standard  deviation  and  ranges 
(maximum  and  minimum  values),  while  the  discrete  variables  were  summarized  in  frequency  tables. 
All  tests  were  bilateral  at  5%  significance  level.  Descriptive  levels  were  considered  as  statistically 
significant if p<0.05. The uric acid and creatinine values at baseline and at 24-48 hours post-treatment 
visit were compared by McNemar test for both ITT (Intent to Treat) and PP (Per Protocol) populations. 
The  analyses  were  performed  according  to  ITT,  PP  and  Safety  population  according  to  the  following 
definitions: 
- 
ITT (Intent To Treat Population): subjects who received at least one dose of rasburicase, 
performed baseline and 24-48 hours and/or 28±3 days uric acid exam; 
- 
PP (Per Protocol Population): all patients who received at least one dose of rasburicase, 
performed baseline and 24-48 hours uric acid exams and did not fit in any relevant protocol 
violation criteria; 
- 
Safety Population: all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

In  the  analysis  provided,  patients  with  normal  /  under  /  undetectable  /  undefined  uric  acid  levels 
comparing to NRV (normal reference values) were assorted to be analyzed by McNemar test. In cases 
where  uric  acid  results  were  expressed  as  “not  detectable”  or  “less  than  a  specific  value”  (i.e.,  less 
than the upper NRV), they were considered in the analysis as with normal or under the NRV.   
2.2.2.  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Between 16 February 2006 and 30 October 2006 a total of 33 patients were included in the study, of 
which 21 were included in the ITT population, 20 in the PP Population, and 32 in the Safety population. 
Patients  were  enrolled  from  3  different  centers,  of  which  11  patients  (33.3%)  in  center  No  1, 
21 patients (63.6%) in center No 2 and 1 patient (3.0%) in center No 4. 
Seven  patients  (21.2%)  have  withdrawn  the  study  observation  before  the  trial  completion,  the  most 
frequent reason for withdrawn being death. 
  Baseline data 
Of  the  33  patients  enrolled,  18  (45.5%)  patients  were  female,  19  (57.6%)  patients  were  black-
Caucasian biracial, with a median age of 7.0 years (range 6 months – 16 years). Weight range was 8 – 
97.5  kg,  or  8  –  61.5  kg  excluding  patient  n.  16.  Twenty-one  (63.6%)  patients  presented  leukaemia 
(51.5%  acute  lymphocytic  leukaemia  and  12.1%  acute  myeloid  leukaemia)  as  tumour  diagnosis,  10 
(30.3%)  patients  lymphoma  (12.1%  Burkitt  lymphoma,  15.2%  Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  and  3.0% 
Hodgkin  lymphoma)  and  2  (6.1%)  patients  neuroblastoma.  Of  the  patients  enrolled,  chemotherapy 
was given as initial therapy in 27 patients (81.8%) and as induction therapy in 32 patients (97.0%). 
  Efficacy results 
At  baseline  visit  mean  value  of  uric  acid  was  8.2  mg/dL  (range:  1.2  –  27.4),  of  creatinine  was 
0.9 mg/dL (range: 0.3 – 5.3) and of LDH was 3240.9 U/L (range: 634 - 19378). 
The  first  post-treatment  visit  should  have  been  done  in  24-48  hours  after  the  last  rasburicase  dose, 
however two patients did not accomplished the routine and performed the above mentioned visit 3 and 
4 days after the end of treatment. The mean time spent was 1.6 days (range: 1-4 days). 
The  second  visit  should  be  done  after  28±3  days  and  it  was  done  in  28.7  days  average  (range  24  – 
36 days).  In  3  patients,  Day  28  visit  has  occurred  in  an  interval  not  foreseen  in  the  protocol  (i.e., 
32 days, 24 days, and 36 days, respectively). 
Patients were treated for a mean of 5.3 days (SD: 1.7 days, range: 1 – 7 days), receiving a mean of 
20.4 bottles of rasburicase (range: 6 – 78 bottles).  
Four  (12.1%)  patients  of  the  33  included  in  the  screening  period  have  not  completed  the  minimum 
time  treatment  (3  days)  required:  one  patient  due  to  death  before  receiving  rasburicase  dose,  one 
patient  due  to  transfer  to  other  institution,  and  two  patients  due  to  development  of  adverse  events 
(allergic reaction and cerebral bleeding, respectively). One patient did not receive rasburicase at day 5 
although he continued treatment until day 7. 
Uric acid evaluation 
Of the 21 patients included in the ITT population, 13 (61.9%) patients had hyperuricemia at baseline 
and  no  (0%)  patient  at  24-48  hours  visit.  Similarly,  in  the  PP  analysis,  13  (65%)  patients  presented 
hyperuricemia at baseline and, at 24-48 hours visit, none of them presented hyperuricemia any longer. 
A significant reduction of uric acid levels was observed at the MacNemar test when comparing uric acid

level  at  24-48  hours  post-treatment  and  baseline  visits  in  ITT  and  PP  population  (χ21 = 11.08 – 
p<0.001). 
At  day  28  ±3  post-  treatment  visit  none  of  the  9  patients  for  which  uric  acid  levels  were  available 
showed hyperuricemia. However, at that time point determination of uric acid levels was not available 
for the majority of patients (52.6%).

– ITT population 
Creatinine evaluation 
Creatinine levels were analyzed in order to evaluate renal protection after treatment with rasburicase.  
At  baseline,  in  the  ITT  population  normal  creatinine  levels  were  observed  in  15  (71.4%)  patients, 
whereas  levels  above  the  normal  reference  values  were  observed  in  5  patients  (23.8%).  One  patient 
had creatinine below the normal range.  
At  24-48  post-treatment  visit,  creatinine  levels  normal/under  the  normal  reference  values  were 
observed in 14 patients (66.7%, 5/9), 4 patients (19%) presented values above the normal range and 
values of 3 patients were missing. 
At day 28 ± 3 post-treatment visit, creatinine values from only 14 patients were available (73.8%), of 
which only 1 (5.3%) was above the normal range.   
The  stratification  at  normal  (NRV  values)  /  abnormal  (under/upper  NRV  values)  creatinine  levels  in 
comparison to laboratories references values showed no significant difference when analyzed at 24-48h 
and baseline visits by MacNemar test (χ21= 0.57 – p=0.4497-ns). 
Analysis of mean and median creatinine values observed show relatively stable parameters during the 
study,  with  the  exception  of  day  6,  where  mean  value  was  6.11  mg/dL  (range  of  values  0.75-43), 
essentially due to one patient suddenly experiencing serum creatinine of 43 mg/dL.

2.2.3.  Discussion 
Rasburicase (Fasturtec) is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme approved in the EU for the treatment 
and  prophylaxis  of  acute  hyperuricemia,  in  order  to  prevent  acute  renal  failure  and  tumour  lysis 
syndrome,  in  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  with  a  high  tumour  burden  and  at  risk  of  a 
rapid  tumour  lysis  or  shrinkage  at  initiation  of  chemotherapy.  Urate-oxidase  is  an  enzyme  able  to 
convert  uric  acid  into  allantoin,  a  water  soluble  product,  easily  excreted  in  the  urine.  Safety  and 
efficacy  of  rasburicase  have  been  assessed  in  studies  in  adults  and  paediatric  patients  (<18  years). 
The recommended dose is 0.20 mg/kg/day as a once daily 30 minutes intravenous infusion for up to 
7 days, dependently on uric acid levels and clinical judgment.   
In a previously performed randomized, comparative, phase III study a significantly more rapid onset of 
action of rasburicase compared with allopurinol was reported in terms of reduction of serum uric acid 
levels.  At  4  hours  after  the  first  dose,  there  was  a  significant  difference  in  the  percentage  of  change 
from  baseline  plasma  acid  uric  concentration  in  the  rasburicase  group  (86%)  compared  with  the 
allopurinol  group  (12.1%).  Moreover,  the  rasburicase  versus  allopurinol  group  experienced  a  2.6-fold 
less exposure to uric acid (Goldman et al, Blood. 2001; 97:2998-3003). 
L9436  was  a  phase  IV  study  was  performed  between  February  and  October  2006  in  order  to  assess 
efficacy  (in  terms  of  reduction  of  uric  acid  levels  and  renal  protection)  and  safety  of  rasburicase  in 
40 paediatric  Brazilian  patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  due  to  haematological  malignancies  and 
presenting  hyperuricemia  or  risk  of  tumour  lysis  syndrome.  Only  a  descriptive  analysis  of  the  results 
was  planned.  A  total  of  33  patients  were  included,  of  which  32  were  treated  with  rasburicase.  Age 
ranged  from  6  months  to  16  years  old  (mean  8.4  years).  The  majority  of  patients  were  females 
(54.5%),  of  black-Caucasian  race  (57.6%),  and  with  diagnosis  of  leukaemia  (63.6%)  or  lymphoma 
(30.3%). 
The  primary  outcome  was  the  evaluation  of  reduction  of  uric  acid  levels  and  monitoring  of  renal 
function  through  evaluation  of  creatinine  levels  24-48  hours  and  28  ±  3  days  after  last  dose  of 
rasburicase.  
The  results  showed  a  significant  reduction  of  the  uric  acid  levels  24-48  hours  after  the  end  of 
treatment: indeed, all the 13 patients presenting hyperuricemia at baseline, experienced normalization 
of  values  24-48  hours  after  treatment  with  rasburicase  (p=0.001  at  MacNemar  test).  No  patients 
presented  hyperuricemia  after  28  days,  however  interpretation  of  data  at  28  days  time  point  is 
hampered  by  the  high  number  of  missing  data  (>50%).  In  this  variation  application,  the  MAH 
Assessment report

explained the handling of the uric acid blood samples and thus confirmed the samples were evaluated 
as necessary in order to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte by blocking the enzymatic activity 
of  Rasburicase  at  the  time  of  taking  blood  samples  (e.g.  by  immediate  separation  of  serum  and 
freezing the sample), which would otherwise give misleading results.  
No  significant  difference  was  observed  when  baseline  creatinine  values  were  compared  with  24-48 
hours  post-treatment  visit  (p=0.4497  at  MacNemar  test).  Analysis  of  mean  and  median  creatinine 
values  observed  showed  relatively  stable  parameters  during  the  study,  with  the  exception  of  day  6, 
where mean value was 6.11 mg/dL (range of values 0.75-43), essentially due to one patient enrolled 
in center 2 experiencing serum creatinine 43 mg/dL. In this variation application, the MAH clarified that 
for  this  patient  the  correct  value  for  serum  creatinine  on  Day  6  is  0,5  mg/dl.  The  value  of  43  was 
inadvertently reported and actually refers to an urea exam. Therefore, the patient presented on Day 6 
a serum creatinine value within normal range. 
Moreover, it was noted that 23% of subjects displayed a serum creatinine above the quoted reference 
interval  at  baseline  and  this  figure  increased  to  40%  at  day  3  of  treatment.  Thereafter,  although  the 
percentage of subjects with serum creatinine above the reference interval declined, the results of days 
4 onwards were based on much reduced subject numbers and so may have been misleading.  
In  response  to  the  CHMP’s  concern,  the  MAH  highlighted  that  the  natural  history  of  Tumour  lysis 
syndrome, and of the renal damage that occurs, is that there is a lag time between reduction of uric 
acid levels and decline of serum creatinine. Thus the elevated baseline values and the day 3 values are 
not  indicative  of  lack  of  a  renal  protective  effect  of  the  product.  As  one  would  expect,  the  values  did 
indeed decline over time. There are sufficient numbers of evaluable patients with follow up to confirm 
this finding. 
The  MAH  initially  tested  for  normality  but  decided  to  perform  a  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test  as  the 
hypothesis of normality was rejected.  
This Wilcoxon rank sum test was statistically significant for the comparison of creatinine levels of:  
1.) baseline vs. day 28 (p < 0.0001) and  
2.) day 3 vs. day 28 (p= 0.0176) . 
The  statistical  significance  of  the  Wilcoxon  test  shows  that  the  distributions  are  not  equal.  Upon 
examination,  the  variation  in  the  creatinine  levels  is  clearly  lower  at  day  28  than  at  baseline  and  at 
day 3 (e.g. 75% of all subjects had values lower than 0.40 for day 28, while more than 75% had their 
values larger than 0.50 at baseline and at day 3). 
Of  note  is  that  the  Wilcoxon  test  cannot  be  interpreted  as  a  test  of  difference  in  medians,  since  the 
distribution  at  28  day  is  clearly  less  spread  (SD=0.24;  max-min=  1)  than  at  baseline  or  at  day  3 
(SD > 1; max-min > 4.5), so that the condition ‘the one distribution is a shifted version of the other” is 
not met (Hart. BMJ. 2001; 323: 391–393).  
The  number  of  patients  with  missing  data  is  7/21=33.3%,  which  is  substantial.  However,  in  most  of 
the  patients  with  missing  data  at  day  28,  there  are  indications  of  decreasing  trends  of  creatinine 
present. Therefore, the impact of missing data is considered not to change the trend observed.  
Overall, this additional analysis confirmed that the creatinine values did decline over time.  
Other  laboratory  parameters  usually  altered  in  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (phosphorus,  potassium, 
calcium)  appeared  to  remain  relatively  stable  during  the  study,  therefore  supporting  the  protecting 
effect of rasburicase against the development of tumour lysis syndrome.

At the request of the CHMP, the MAH also provided efficacy and safety results reported by age ranges 
(infants  [28  days-24  months],  child  [2-11  years],  adolescents  [12-18  years]).  Concerning  efficacy  in 
each  age-group,  the  use of  Fasturtec  showed  efficacy,  although  the  numbers  were  too small  to  allow 
performing  a  statistical  test  on  these  data  and  would  not  have  allowed  obtaining  a  powerful  and 
relevant analysis.  
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered,  the  results  of  the  L9436  study  appeared  to  confirm  efficacy  of 
rasburicase  in  treating  hyperuricemia  and  preventing  tumour  lysis  syndrome.  The  CHMP  also 
considered that the age range of paediatric patients should be clarified in sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC.  
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.3.1.  Results 
  Adverse events (AEs) 
Of the 32 patients included in the safety population, 30 (93.7%) patients reported 135 AEs, of which 
only one (i.e., allergic reaction), observed in 2 patients (6.3%), was considered related to rasburicase.  
The  most  frequently  observed  AEs  were  vomiting  (16  events  in  11  [34.4%]  patients),  followed  by 
febrile  neutropenia  (6  events  in  6  patients  [18.8%]),  fever  (8  events  in  5  [15.6%]  patients)  and 
nausea  (5  events  in  4  [12.5%]  patients).  Most  non-serious  AEs  were  of  grade  1  severity  (62.7%); 
grade 2 and 3 AEs were reported in 25.5% and 10.9% cases, respectively, whereas only one (0.9%) 
event was graded 4 (hepatic enzyme increase). 
Twenty-five  (25)  Serious  AEs  (SAEs)  were  reported  in  19  patients  (59.4%),  but  none  of  them  was 
considered related to the study drug. Regarding the severity of the SAEs, grade 4 SAEs were observed 
in 6 (24%) patients, grade 3 SAEs in 5 (20%) patients, grade 2 SAEs in 2 (8%) patients and grade 1 
SAEs in 3 (12%) patients. In 9 SAEs (36%) intensity was not reported.  
Two  (6.3%)  patients  were  withdrawn  from  treatment  due  to  AEs  (i.e.,  1  related  to  allergic  reaction, 
another 1 related to central nervous system bleeding). 
Five  (15.6%)  patients  died  due  to  AEs  (i.e.,  2  patients  due  to  sepsis,  1  due  to  renal  failure  and 
bleeding,  1  due  to  oliguria,  hypovolaemia,  acute  lung  oedema  and  cardiac  congestive  failure,  and  1 
patient due to central nervous system bleeding); none of the death events was assessed as related to 
rasburicase. 
  Laboratory findings 
A descriptive analysis was provided where laboratory results regarding uric acid, creatinine, potassium, 
calcium, phosphorus, haemoglobin, platelet, leucocyte and neutrophil counts were compared to normal 
reference values and baseline. Results regarding uric acid and creatinine levels were in line with what 
reported in the efficacy results section. 
Overall, analysis of the levels of potassium, phosphorus and calcium through the study did not suggest 
any  significant  incidence  of  hyperkalaemia,  hyperphosphataemia  and  hypocalcaemia,  therefore 
indirectly supporting the  claimed protective effect of rasburicase against development of tumour lysis 
syndrome.  However,  the  absence  of  a  control  arm  and  the  high  number  of  missed  determinations  at 
24-48 hours and at day 28±3 time points (31-57%) does not allow to drawn any firm conclusion over 
this issue.

Reduction  in  haemoglobin,  platelet  and  white  blood  cell  counts  was  frequently  reported  during  the 
study, 24-48 hour and 28 days after treatment; however, as rasburicase is administered as supportive 
care to cytoreductive chemotherapy, the causality of these events is difficult to assess. 
2.3.2.  Discussion 
The  evaluation  of  the  safety  of  the  drug  was  hampered  also  by  the  concomitant  administration  of 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy  and  by  the  lack  of  a  control  group  in  the  study.  However,  the  AEs  reported 
were in line with the known safety profile of the drug. Allergic reactions clearly related to study drug 
were observed in 2 patients (6.3%). Other frequently reported AEs consist of vomiting (34.4%), fever 
(15.6%),  nausea  (12.5%),  diarrhoea  (12.5%),  and  headache  (9.4%),  which  represent  the  most 
frequently  reported  with  rasburicase  in  other  studies  too  (refer also  to SmPC).  No  new  safety  signals 
were  observed.  The  MAH  confirmed 
in 
this  application 
that 
there  were  no  cases  of 
methaemoglobinaemia  nor  haemolysis  reported  in  this  study.  Therefore  these  adverse  events  of 
special interest have not been mentioned in the L9436 CSR. 
At the request of the CHMP, the MAH also provided efficacy and safety results reported by age ranges 
(infants [28 days-24 months], child [2-11 years], adolescents [12-18 years]). Concerning the safety, 
the numbers are very small but the frequency and type of AEs registered are acceptable and conform 
to the safety profile in adults. No additional or new AEs were reported. The safety of Fasturtec in this 
population and administered in such a specific serious disease, is acceptable.  
2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI),  to  which  the  CHMP  agreed 
(deletions in strikethrough and insertions in bold underlined):  
  Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications of the SmPC 
Treatment and prophylaxis of acute hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in patients 
adults, children and adolescents (aged 0 to 17 years) with haematological malignancy with a 
high tumour burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy. 
  Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In aA randomised comparative phase III study, performed in 52 paediatric patients, 27 patients 
were treated with rasburicase at using the recommended dose of 0.20 mg/kg/day, 
intravenously, for 4 to 7 days (< 5 years: n=11; 6-12 years: n=11; 13-17 years: n=5), and 
25 patients with allopurinol daily oral doses for 4 to 8 days. Results showed a significantly 
more rapid onset of action of Fasturtec in comparison with allopurinol. At 4 hours post first dose, there 
was a significant difference in the mean percentage change from baseline plasma uric acid 
concentration (p <0.0001) in the Fasturtec group (-86.0%) compared to that for the allopurinol group 
(-12.1%). 
[…] 
In pivotal clinical studies, 246 paediatric patients (<18  mean age 7 years, range 0 to17) were 
treated with rasburicase at doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day or 0.20 mg/kg/day for 1 to 8 days (mainly 5 to 
7 days). Efficacy results on 229 evaluable patients showed an overall response rate (normalization of 
plasma uric acid levels) of 96.1%. Safety results on 246 patients were consistent with the adverse 
events profile in the overall population. 
In long term safety studies, an analysis of data from 867 paediatric patients (<18  mean age 7.3 
years, range 0 to17) treated with rasburicase at 0.20 mg/kg/day for 1 to 24 days (mainly 1 to 4 days) 
showed consistent findings with pivotal clinical studies in terms of efficacy and safety.

During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI in order to also update the 
package leaflet accordingly: 
Section 1 What Fasturtec is and what it is used for of the Package Leaflet 
Fasturtec contains the active ingredient rasburicase. 
Rasburicase is used to treat or prevent high blood levels of uric acid from occurring in adults, 
children and adolescents (aged 0 to 17 years) patients with disorders of the blood cells 
(haematological diseases) who are about to receive or are receiving chemotherapy treatment.  
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of Ireland and Portugal. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Overall, the CHMP considered the results of the L9436 study appeared to confirm efficacy of 
rasburicase in treating hyperuricemia and preventing tumour lysis syndrome. The safety was in line 
with the known safety profile of the drug. The CHMP considered that the age range of paediatric 
patients should be clarified in sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  The benefit-risk balance of Fasturtec 
remains unchanged. 
4.  Recommendations

Summary of risk management plan for Intrarosa 
(prasterone) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Intrarosa.  The  RMP 
details  important  risks  of  Intrarosa,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised  and  how 
more information will be obtained about Intrarosa's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Intrarosa's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  Intrarosa 
should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Intrarosa  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Intrarosa's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
is  authorised 
Intrarosa 
in 
postmenopausal  women  having  moderate  to  severe  symptoms  (see  SmPC  for  the 
full  indication).  It  contains  prasterone  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given 
intravaginally. 
for  treatment  of  vulvar  and  vaginal  atrophy 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Intrarosa’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Intrarosa’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage.

Important risks of Intrarosa, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Intrarosa's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size-the amount of medicine in a pack is chose so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status- the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analyzed,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Intrarosa  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  for  Intrarosa  are  risks  that  would  need  special  risk  management 
activities  to  further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product 
can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or 
potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link 
with the use of Intrarosa. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and 
would benefit to be collected.

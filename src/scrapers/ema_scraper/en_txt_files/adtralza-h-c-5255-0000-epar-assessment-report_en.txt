2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease. It is 
characterised by eczematous lesions including erythema, excoriations, lichenification, infiltration, 
oozing, xerosis and pruritus. 
All of these symptoms can be debilitating and associated with pain, sleep disturbance, and impaired 
social functioning. The patient burden of disease relates directly to the physical signs and symptoms of 
disease (e.g. pruritus and pain) as well as indirectly to the harmful impact of skin symptoms on sleep 
(e.g. difficulty falling asleep, more frequent awakenings, prolonged awakenings, and fragmented 
sleep), mental health, concentration, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, activities of daily 
living, performance at school and work, increased number of sick days, and missed days of work. 
More than half of patients with moderate-to-severe AD have been reported to suffer from depression 
and anxiety. Emotional distress resulting from AD, such as embarrassment, low self-esteem and 
difficulties establishing and maintaining relationships, is also frequently reported. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
AD is the most common inflammatory skin disease in the developed world. The onset of disease is 
usually reported in childhood, but the prevalence in adults remains high despite some tendency to 
remission. Approximately 1 in 4 adults reports onset of disease in adulthood1. 
The prevalence varies between regions: in a web-based survey (2018) using a modified UK Working 
Party definition of AD, the 1-year prevalence of AD in adults was reported to be 4.3% in Japan, 8.1% 
in Canada, 9.4% in Europe, and 11.9% in the US2. In a similar web-based survey (2018) that used 
data from the US Census Bureau to create adjusted sample weights, the 1-year prevalence of AD 
representative for the adult US population was estimated to be 7.3%3. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis of AD is a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, the environment, skin 
barrier dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. The immune dysregulation is predominantly driven by 
human type 2 helper (Th2) lymphocytes that can be found in abundance in AD skin lesions together 
with increased levels of Th2-derived cytokines, especially interleukin-13 (IL-13). The action of IL-13 on 
its target cells results in epidermal barrier disruption, allergen reactivity and inflammation which drive 
the pathogenesis of AD.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
AD is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterised by pruritus, xerosis, 
and eczematous lesions. Especially pruritus and skin infections which are a major complication in AD 
compromise health and lower the quality of life and, in the worst case, can result in psychic 
comorbidities as anxiety and depression. 
The diagnosis of AD is made clinically as there is currently no reliable biomarker that can distinguish 
the disease from other entities. The clinical diagnosis is based on historical features, morphology and 
distribution of skin lesions, and associated clinical signs. Formal sets of criteria have been developed 
by various groups to aid classification4. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Management of moderate-to-severe AD is challenging because of the chronicity of the disease and the 
limited therapeutic options that are both efficacious and have an acceptable long-term safety profile. A 
“control-based” and “risk-based” model of disease management, in which an initial diagnosis is 
followed by treatment according to categorisation of severity, is usually recommended. The 
pharmacological treatment algorithm for AD progresses from mild topical anti-inflammatory therapy, to 
high potency topical therapy, and in some cases leads to systemic immunomodulatory therapy. In 
general, the key treatment guidelines recommend the use of systemic treatment in patients that are 
not adequately controlled by optimised topical therapies4,5,6,7,8. 
Current therapies and interventions include education, emollients, and avoidance of exacerbating 
factors. For induction and intermittent topical corticosteroids therapy (TCS), topical calcineurins (TCI) 
and topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors are used. The topical therapies can be cumbersome 
and for TCS and TCI associated with side effects that can limit their use. Phototherapy (PUVA, UV-B, 
narrow band UV-B, UV-A and UV-A1) is used for widespread disease but can be time consuming and 
long-term use can be associated with side effects. Systemic oral therapies (azathioprine, 
methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin) are used for severe and recalcitrant disease but 
they can be associated with toxicities that can limit their use.  
Currently, 2 systemic therapies are centrally approved in the EU for patients with AD: dupilumab 
(Dupixent), an injectable monoclonal antibody against IL4/IL13 approved in 2017 for moderate-to-
severe AD in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy; and 
baricitinib (Olumiant), a Janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitor approved in July 2020 for moderate to severe AD 
in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. In addition, two topical treatments 
(ointments) are approved in AD in the European Union (EU): crisaborole (Staquis) a PDE-4 inhibitor 
and tracrolimus monohydrate (Protopic) a calcineurin inhibitor.

Page 13/14 
 
 
 
The active substance is manufactured at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP Frederick Manufacturing 
Centre (FMC), Maryland, USA. The documentation provided supports that the DS is manufactured and 
tested in a GMP environment.  
The tralokinumab DS manufacturing process is initiated by thawing and inoculating cells from the 
characterised NS0 working cell bank (WCB) vial into culture medium. The inoculum expansion process 
is carried out using multiple steps until sufficient cells to seed the production bioreactor are reached. 
The production bioreactor is operated in fed batch mode. Harvest of the production bioreactor is 
initiated within the specified step duration. 
Downstream manufacture comprises processing by chromatography steps, viral inactivation and 
removal steps, concentration and buffer exchange, and formulation. The final DS is filtered into bags 
and stored. 
Process parameters and In-Process Controls (IPCs) are listed for the manufacturing process. IPCs are 
in place to control for microbial contamination and have associated action limits.  
Two purification process steps are qualified as reprocessing steps for the manufacture of the active 
sub-stance: virus refiltration and formulated bulk refiltration. Procedures with criteria for each 
reprocessing step have been adequately described. 
Control of materials 
The applicant has provided a list of raw materials used in DS manufacture including where in the 
process they are used as well as names of suppliers. Specifications are provided for the non-
compendial raw materials. The active substance is expressed in an NS0 cell line. The development of 
the Master Cell Bank (MCB) and WCB are sufficiently described. The cell banks were characterised 
according to ICH requirements Q5A (R1), Q5B and Q5D. A protocol has been presented for preparation 
and qualification of future working cell banks.  
It is acknowledged that NS0 cell lines, which are used to manufacture many EU approved biologics, are 
known to harbour endogenous retroviruses. As discussed further in the adventitious agents section, 
viral clearance data presented supports the conclusion that the presence of specific endogenous 
retroviruses in the cell banks used for the production of tralokinumab presents negligible safety risk to 
patients.   
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The approach for process characterisation is stepwise, as follows: verification of suitability of scale-
down model, risk assessment to define characterisation study design, execution of process 
characterisation studies, and finally determination of Critical Process Parameters (CPPs).  
The scaled down models are considered representative of commercial scale.  
Process characterisation was conducted on each unit operation. For each unit operation the risk 
assessment rationale for parameters that were not subject to further characterisation studies is also 
provided. For those process parameters assessed as having an impact on critical quality attributes 
(CQAs), the ranges of that process parameter were studied to determine an impact on the relevant 
CQAs.  
Overall, the proposed control strategy, which is based on extensive product and process understanding 
from manufacturing experience, comparability/process characterisation and process validation data, is 
considered appropriate to ensure process consistency and results in a product capable of meeting the 
required quality attributes. 
Process validation

Manufacture of tralokinumab DS at the commercial-scale facility at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP 
Frederick, USA has been validated using a stepwise approach including process design, process 
validation and continued process verification. The process validation included CPPs, Non-Critical 
Process Parameters (NCPPs), IPCs, Microbial Controls (MCs), and Performance Attributes (PAs). Full DS 
process validation was performed on the process validation lots. All proposed commercial release 
specifications were met for the validation lots. 
DS shipping qualification studies were performed to support shipping of tralokinumab DS to the 
finished product fill location. The results of the operational qualification and performance qualification 
support suitable qualification. 
Manufacturing process development 
A systematic severity assessment for identification of CQAs was conducted. The criticality of an 
attribute directly relates to the biological activity, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety and 
immunogenicity of the product and the severity is based on both impact and uncertainty of the 
attribute. The assigned CQAs are acceptable.  
Seven different manufacturing processes were used during the development of tralokinumab. The 
development began in 2003 with Process 1. Between 2004 and 2012, five additional processes were 
introduced. None of the Process 1 to 6 batches were used in clinical studies for the intended atopic 
dermatitis indication. In 2013 Process 7 was introduced, with two further Process 7 campaigns in 2016 
and 2018. The 2013 Process 7 batches were used in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 atopic dermatitis studies 
which enrolled over 1500 subjects. The 2016 Process 7 batches were also used in these three pivotal 
studies and in a further three Phase 3 clinical studies in atopic dermatitis (ECZTRA 4, 5 and 6), and in 
the ECZTEND open label extension study (1125 subjects). The 2018 Process 7 batch was also used in 
the ECZTEND study. Three Process 7 process validation batches were also manufactured in 2018. 
Process changes across these seven processes include scale up, site changes (new production 
facilities), changes to media and nutrient feed formulations, new WCB, changes to purification steps 
and, formulation development, amongst other minor changes. Detailed tables of lot genealogy of all 
material manufactured from Process 1 through Process 7 that were used in nonclinical and clinical 
studies are provided.  
Studies on the impact of process changes on viral clearance are provided. It can be acknowledged that 
none of the process changes have negatively impacted viral safety of the finished product. Detailed 
comparability testing performed to support product quality throughout the product development is 
presented, and based on the extensive data presented for all processes the claim of comparability is 
supported. The results are within their established acceptance criteria and aligned with process 
manufacturing trends.  
Overall, the data presented supports the comparability of material used in the pivotal studies and PPQ 
batches. 
Characterisation  
Tralokinumab has been comprehensively characterized for primary structure, secondary structure, 
charge heterogeneity, size heterogeneity, and biological activity.  
Molecular weight was determined and the primary sequence was confirmed. There was 100% coverage 
of the light chain and heavy chain. The N-linked oligosaccharide profile was analysed. 
The charge profile of tralokinumab is influenced by deamidation, glycation, sialylation, half antibody, 
oxidation, aglycosylation, and succinimide.  
Size heterogeneity was characterized by several analytical methods. The level of aggregates was low.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 15/16 
 
 
 
Higher order structure was examined. The secondary and tertiary structure was typical for a mAb.  
Biological activity was characterized using an IL-13 reporter gene assay and a HUVEC-based enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Tralokinumab shows a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-13 in 
both assays.  IL-13 binding was also measured. As IL-13 is a soluble target, tralokinumab is not 
considered to have effector function. Therefore, Antibody-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) were not examined. Binding to the Fc receptors FcγRI, 
FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa-158V/F, and FcRn were measured by SPR. 
Overall, the active substance has been sufficiently characterized. 
Impurities 
Product- and process-related impurities have been suitably characterised and are considered 
adequately controlled. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure 
The proposed panel of release tests cover appearance, identity, quantity, purity/impurities, potency, 
general tests and microbial assurance. In general, the panel of tests is in line with ICH Q6B and Ph. 
Eur. 2031 monoclonal antibodies for human use and is considered appropriate for routine control of a 
monoclonal antibody both at release and shelf life.  
The statistical model used has been adequately described and justified and is considered an acceptable 
approach for justifying the specifications. Nonetheless, the Applicant is recommended to re-evaluate 
the active substance and finished product specification limits once 30 batches have been analysed, and 
to provide these revised specification limits upon availability (see “Recommendations for future quality 
development”). 
Analytical methods 
The analytical method descriptions for the non-compendial methods are provided in the dossier. The 
analytical method descriptions include details of reagents, sample preparation, operating conditions, 
and system suitability tests (SSTs). In general, the method descriptions are considered acceptable.  
The in-house methods were validated for accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision, linearity, 
range and specificity Overall, the methods have been validated in line with ICH Q2 and are considered 
appropriate for release testing of the active substance. Compendial analytical procedures  were verified 
and confirmed suitable for their intended use according to the current Ph. Eur. requirements.  
Batch analyses 
Batch release data has been provided for multiple batches. This includes batches from process 1 to 
process 7 and covering also batches used in clinical studies. Some of the analytical methods have 
changed during product development, however historical method changes prior to the introduction of 
process 7 are not of concern. The data show that the commercial process in capable of producing 
active substance of consistent quality.   
Reference materials 
A standard two-tier reference standard system is used with a primary and secondary reference 
standard. The reference standards have been sufficiently characterized, including release tests and 
additional characterization tests . A protocol for the qualification of future reference standards has 
been provided.

Container closure system 
The active substance is stored in bags. The bags comply with Ph. Eur. 3.1.7 and Ph. Eur. 5.2.8. Results 
from extractable  and leachables studies have been provided and are considered acceptable. 
Stability 
Stability  studies  were  generally  performed  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5C.  Data  are  provided  for  lots 
manufactured  according  to  process  7,  including  the  PPQ  batches.  The  quality  of  these  batches  is 
considered  representative  for  the  quality  of  the  material  used  in  clinical  studies  and  of  the  quality  of 
commercial  material.  The  material  of  construction  for  the  container/closure  system  used  for  stability 
studies is identical to that of the commercial scale container closure. 
Real time stability data is provided to support the proposed shelf life.  
No significant changes are observed during long term storage. All batches remained within specification 
over the course of the stability studies.  
The applicant proposes a combination of two storage conditions. There is nothing in the stability dataset 
that would lead to a concern of an out of specification result using this combination storage approach. 
Therefore, the proposal can be endorsed.  
Accelerated and stress stability data was provided. The accelerated and stress stability data confirm the 
stability-indicating methods  
In conclusion, the proposed DS shelf life is deemed justified.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
The finished product (drug product, DP) is a sterile, preservative-free, solution for subcutaneous (SC) 
injection presented in a single-dose accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS). In brief, the PFS is 
accessorized with a needle safety guard, extended finger flange and plunger rod. The label claim for 
each APFS is 150 mg tralokinumab in 1 mL. All excipients (sodium acetate trihydrate, glacial acetic 
acid, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80) are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients or excipients of human / animal origin 
used in the finished product formulation.  
The applied overfill is acceptable and will ensure a dose of 1 mL can be delivered. The DP does not 
contain an overage of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The goal of formulation development was to achieve a liquid dosage form with sufficient stability at the 
intended storage condition for long-term storage. The chosen formulation adequately accommodates 
the active substance’s physicochemical properties in terms of stability, solubility and route of 
administration. This is supported by formulation development studies, stability data and product 
osmolality. 
The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used during clinical studies. There have been 
changes in the container closure (from vial to APFS) and subsequent changes to the APFS 
manufacturing process. There have also been site transfers. Comparability is well demonstrated and 
included data from release testing, characterisation data and data from samples stored under 
accelerated and stressed conditions.  
Container closure 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 17/18 
 
 
 
The container closure is a 1 mL long siliconized clear and colorless glass syringe barrel with a 27- 
gauge, ½-in, special thin-wall staked stainless steel needle, and rigid needle shield. The proposed 
primary closure is a coated plunger stopper. The glass barrel used complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 (Glass 
Containers For Pharmaceutical Use), the stopper and shield comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 (Rubber 
Closures For Containers For Aqueous Parenteral Preparations) and this is endorsed. Given that there is 
no relevant Ph. Eur. monograph for the steel needle, it is acceptable that it has been detailed to 
comply with ISO 9626 (stainless steel needle tubing for manufacture of medical devices). Adequate 
detail, in line with EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015 is provided on how the components are 
sterilised.  
The medicinal product includes components which are classified as medical devices. The device is 
shown to be suitable in relation to the clinical performance of the product (dosing accuracy). 
Tralokinumab APFS complies with the relevant essential requirements related to the device constituent 
part according to Annex I of the MDD.   
In conclusion, the container closure system is suitable for use based on development studies, stability 
studies and the fact that it has been developed in accordance with relevant ISO standards, Ph. Eur. 
texts and EU guidelines. 
Process Characterisation  
The process and steps included are suitable for the manufacture of this product as demonstrated 
through process characterisation studies. In brief, the effects of PPs on QAs for each step were 
characterised. PPs were deemed non-critical if during these studies, no effect on QAs were seen. 
However, in some instances, some PPs were deemed critical as a precaution. This approach is 
endorsed.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Batch release is proposed to be performed at LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark.  
The manufacturing process is standard for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and has been adequately 
described. The DS is thawed and shipped to the fill facility. At the filling facility, the DS undergoes 
warming, pooling and mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, temperature equilibration and sterile 
filtration. Next the syringe is filled and stoppered and undergoes 100% visual inspection. The filled and 
stoppered syringe is stored until the start of the labelling, assembly, and packaging process. Each 
individual syringe has a plunger rod inserted. Printed labels are applied to the syringe. Finger flange is 
assembled together with the safety device (needle safety guard) and merged with the syringe to 
complete the assembly of the APFS. The APFS is packed with package insert into cartons. 
Process controls are deemed adequate. Process parameters and in-process controls are adequately set 
to control the process leading to consistent quality as demonstrated by PPQ lot data. The proposed 
process ranges are based on process characterisation data where it is deemed the QAs evaluated as 
outputs for each step are appropriate. The data provided in support of the ranges is acceptable. 
Process validation was performed on three consecutive process validation lots. The data provided 
demonstrates that the DP manufacturing process is valid and under control for the manufacture of 
batches  of the proposed batch size. The process is capable of producing material of consistent quality.   
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specification is considered comprehensive and therefore acceptable. Parameters 
tested include appearance, quantity, identity, purity/impurities, potency, adventitious agents and 
general tests. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 18/19 
 
 
 
 
Data was provided demonstrating that polysorbate-80 (PS-80) remains within specification throughout 
the DP manufacturing process and during long term and in-use stability. It was therefore deemed 
acceptable to not include a control for PS-80 at DP release.   
Justification of DP acceptance criteria for many tests has been provided in the DS section of the 
dossier. This is acceptable. Where differences in DS and DP acceptance criteria exist, adequate 
justification has been provided. As outlined in the active substance section, the Applicant is 
recommended to re-evaluate the active substance and finished product specification limits once 30 
batches have been analysed, and to provide these revised specification limits upon availability (see 
“Recommendations for future quality development”). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was 
requested in the form of a major objection. Based on the information provided in response, it is 
accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. The major objection is considered satisfactorily resolved. 
Analytical methods 
For the most part, the proposed methods are those included in the DS section of the dossier, which is 
considered suitable as the DP is the same as the DS, in terms of formulation, and the DP 
manufacturing process would not be considered to impact on the performance of these tests or on their 
validation status. Additional testing using Ph. Eur. methods is proposed, which is acceptable. For 
additional DP specific testing the methods are deemed suitable. 
For methods common to both testing DS and DP, no additional validation is performed. This is 
acceptable. For Ph. Eur. methods specific to DP testing product specific qualification is performed, 
demonstrating that tralokinumab does not interfere with method performance. DP specific methods 
have been suitably validated. Method transfer to the proposed QC sites is adequately shown.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of all vial (process 1-7) and prefilled syringe lots (process 7) manufactured to date 
have been provided. All test results complied with the specifications set at the time the batches were 
tested. The batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of the product and indicate that 
the process is under control.  
Reference materials 
The same reference standard is used for release testing of both DS and DP. Given that the methods 
are the same and the formulation is unchanged from DS to DP, this is acceptable. For details, please 
refer to the active substance section.  
Stability of the product 
The claimed shelf life is 36 months at 5°C with an in-use shelf life of 14 days at up to 30°C. Studies in 
support of this claim are conducted in accordance with ICH guidance. Material is stored in the proposed 
commercial container and stability indicating attributes have been appropriately identified using 
temperature stressed conditions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 19/20 
 
 
 
 
In support of the proposed shelf life, real-time data at 5°C is provided for several lots. With some 
minor exceptions the real time data do not reveal any clear trends, even after long term storage. 
During the claimed shelf life (3 years) no evident changes in any of the parameters are observed. 
Data provided in support of the proposed 14 day in-use shelf life at up to 30°C is provided and shows 
all quality attributes meet their criteria.  
Photostability has been appropriately evaluated in accordance with ICH Q1B. The product was shown 
to be light sensitive. The secondary packaging offers adequate protection against light degradation and 
the product information instructs the user to store the product in the secondary packaging. This is 
acceptable.  
Data from ongoing extractables and leachables studies is acceptable and show all identified compounds 
to be below the daily threshold of toxicological concern (TTC).  
The stability data provided confirm the proposed shelf life (3 years at 5 °C) and in-use period (room 
temperature up to 25 °C for a maximum of 14 days).  
Adventitious agents 
Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE/BSE)  
Materials of animal origin used in host cell line culture, cell line development, cell banking, and the 
manufacturing process have been described. Certificates of analysis (CoAs), certificates of origin and 
TSE Certificates of Suitability were provided as relevant.  
As required, a risk assessment of the transmission of BSE from materials of animal origin used in the 
culture and banking of the host cell line has been performed and concludes that the risk posed for 
potential BSE infectious agent introduction is low.  
Viral safety 
The programme of testing for the MCB and WCB for virus contamination is adequately described. No 
infectious viral agents were detected with the exception of endogenous infectious retrovirus. It is 
acknowledged that some murine cell lines used for the production of monoclonal antibodies will contain 
endogenous retroviruses (as per ICH Q5A), and it is agreed that the viral clearance data shows the 
process is sufficiently capable of removing the virus. The applicant provided a risk assessment 
specifically focused on any potential impact on product safety. The risk assessment presented is 
considered supportive and it is agreed that the viral clearance data presented (discussed below) 
supports the conclusion that the presence of endogenous retrovirus in the cell banks used for the 
production of tralokinumab presents minimal safety risk to patients. 
The viral clearance capability of the tralokinumab downstream purification process was evaluated at 
small scale using four model viruses with different physicochemical properties. Five steps of the 
purification process were evaluated. For the chromatography steps, both new and used resin was 
tested and the lowest observed log reduction value (LRV) is claimed for each model virus. Additionally, 
virus carryover experiments were performed for both the new and used resins to determine the 
effectiveness of column sanitisation. The results of these studies were found to be supportive of the 
sanitisation process of each column.  
The viral clearance experiments were carried out in accordance with the ICH Q5A and demonstrated 
that the purification process provides satisfactory cumulative log10 reduction values (LRVs) of the 
model viruses. 
A safety margin was calculated for clearance of endogenous retrovirus-like particles using the defined 
process clearance data in conjunction with worst case retrovirus-like particle titer results and process

performance data. This is consistent with other approved antibody products manufactured by similar 
processes. 
The overall viral safety of tralokinumab is considered acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
In response to a major objection raised, the applicant has provided an adequate risk evaluation 
concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities which concludes that there is no risk identified. The 
major objection is therefore considered resolved. 
Two recommendations to re-evaluate the active substance and finished product specification have been 
agreed with the applicant. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
To re-evaluate the active substance specification limits once 30 batches of the active substance have 
been analysed, and to provide these revised specification limits upon availability. 
To re-evaluate the finished product specification limits once 30 batches of the finished product have 
been analysed, and to provide these revised specification limits upon availability. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The marketing authorisation application (MAA) comprised a comprehensive battery of pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology tests. 
The tralokinumab non-clinical pharmacology program evaluated the pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
tralokinumab in a variety of in vitro assays and in vivo models (mouse, cynomolgus monkey), as well 
as any effects of tralokinumab on safety pharmacology endpoints in repeat-dose toxicology studies in 
the cynomolgus monkey. One single dose PK study of tralokinumab was performed in Ascaris suum 
sensitised cynomolgus monkeys (study CAT354Rp034). Repeat dose toxicokinetics of tralokinumab 
was assessed from toxicology studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 21/22 
 
 
 
The cynomolgus monkey was used in the pharmacology, PK and toxicology studies to support the 
clinical program because tralokinumab was shown to be pharmacologically active in human and 
cynomolgus monkey, as it neutralises both human and cynomolgus monkey IL-13. However, 
tralokinumab did not neutralise the effects of mouse IL-13. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacology in vitro 
In initial in vitro experiments the binding efficacy of tralokinumab to human recombinant IL-13 was 
assessed using Biacore analysis and initially determined to be 165 pM, a value that was subsequently 
adjusted to 58 pM based on further experiment using a more sensitive Biacore instrument. The binding 
of tralokinumab to IL-13 was demonstrated to prevent the interaction of IL-13 with both of its 
receptors, IL13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. Downstream of this IL-13 mediated cell proliferation was 
significantly antagonised by tralokinumab with proliferation of the IL-13 dependent TF-1 cell line (a 
human erythroleukemic cell line) inhibited with an IC50 of 1.1 nM. Similar effects were seen in HDLM-2 
cells (Hodgkin’s lymphoma derived cell line) demonstrating the functional consequences of this binding 
of tralokinumab to IL-13. 
In order to investigate the potential modulation of signalling events associated with AD, several in vitro 
studies using human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were performed. IL-13-induced 
expression of the inflammatory mediators chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), 
neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1) and IL13RA2 in keratinocytes, and CCL2, CCL11 
and POSTN (periostin) in fibroblasts, which have been linked to the pathogenesis of AD, was reduced in 
a dose dependent manner by tralokinumab treatment. Similarly, the IL-13-mediated reduction in 
Filaggrin (FLG), FLG2, loricrin (LOR), ELOVL3 and DEFB4A, all genes involved in maintenance of the 
skin barrier, was significantly attenuated by tralokinumab treatment in differentiated keratinocytes. 
Importantly, the effects seen on the inflammatory and skin barrier markers were only evident when IL-
13 was used as the stimulant and not IL-4, suggesting the specificity of tralokinumab for modulating 
IL-13 mediated signalling events. In addition, a series of further in vitro studies have been performed 
using assays and endpoints which are more relevant to tralokinumab and its potential to modulate 
events in the lung and respiratory airways including release of eotaxin-1 from lung fibroblasts and the 
modulation of eosinophil shape and calcium signalling in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Although these 
studies are not directly relevant for the proposed indication, they nevertheless provide evidence that 
inhibition of IL-13 signalling can functionally affect a number of aspects associated with its pro-
inflammatory effects. In particular, tralokinumab was seen to significantly reduce the switch of B cells 
to produce IgE antibodies. 
To investigate the ability of tralokinumab to cross reactive with IL-13 from other species, amino acid 
sequence homology comparisons were performed. A high degree of sequence similarity with IL-13 of 
95% was seen between human and cynomolgus monkey. In contrast, the sequence similarity for 
rodent IL-13 is lower at 55% for mouse IL-13 and 62% for rat IL-13. Based on the lack of activity of 
tralokinumab in an assay measuring cell proliferation induced by mouse IL-13, it has been concluded 
that tralokinumab does not bind to rodent IL-13. Tralokinumab was shown to inhibit human and 
monkey IL-13 mediated TF-1 cell proliferation with comparable potency (IC50=1.1 nM and 1.7 nM, 
respectively). Affinity binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance binds to recombinant 
cynomolgus monkey IL-13 with a measured KD of 0.6 nM, compared to 0.06 nM for human IL-13. 
Homology analysis of the amino acid residues in the tralokinumab binding epitope between human IL-

13 and cynomolgus monkey IL-13 revealed only one conservative change: Leu100Val. Overall, this 
data suggest that tralokinumab binds to monkey IL-13 with a comparable affinity to that of human IL-
13.   
Primary pharmacology in vivo 
The in vivo proof of principle experiments have been performed using models of type 2 immune 
responses mediated through signalling via IL-13. While some of the in vitro data suggest applicability 
of tralokinumab in treatment of AD, no relevant model of AD (e.g. ex vivo or in vitro human skin 
models) was presented in a proof of concept study. Several of the models were performed in mice 
whereas previously discussed the endogenous mouse IL-13 is not bound by tralokinumab. For these 
studies, injection of human recombinant IL-13 was used since it can bind the mouse IL-13 receptor 
and mediate signalling in this manner, however, the activity of human IL-13 at the mouse receptor is 
less than that of mouse IL-13 at the same receptor. 
IL-13 was used to induce inflammation in an air pouch inflammation model in mice. Tralokinumab 
when administered locally via injection into the air pouch inhibited the infiltration of total leukocytes, 
eosinophils and monocytic cells in a dose dependent manner. For systemically administered 
tralokinumab, these effects were only seen at the top dose of 30 mg/kg via intravenous (IV) injection. 
In addition, in a lung inflammation mouse model, tralokinumab delivered via intraperitoneal injection 
inhibited airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophil infiltration.  
Further in vivo studies in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that tralokinumab suppressed total IgE levels 
in animals with high baseline levels of IgE but not those with lower levels. In general evaluation of 
tralokinumab efficacy in a cynomolgus monkey lung allergen challenge model showed a modest effect 
in reducing lung inflammation in the double, but not single allergen challenge model. In all the studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys the administration of tralokinumab was via IV injection and no studies have 
been performed with SC injection, the proposed clinical route of administration. 
The study in the mice with the air pouch inflammation model suggested that the infiltration of 
neutrophils into the area of the air pouch was significantly enhanced at the lowest dose of 
tralokinumab used. Furthermore, in cynomolgus monkeys given an IV injection of 10 mg/kg of 
tralokinumab (Study CAT354Rp034) haematology measurements suggested a significant increase in 
neutrophils at Day 1 post injection. The clinical significance of these effects on neutrophils observation 
are unknown but the clinical route of administration is SC and the formulation used in these 
experiments is different from the one used clinically.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary PD studies have been performed which is acceptable for a monoclonal antibody. The 
tissue cross reactivity performed as part of the toxicology studies suggest no binding of tralokinumab 
to any of the human tissues investigated. Indeed, as a soluble cytokine, no major tissue expression of 
IL-13 has been reported in the literature. As an IgG4 antibody, the potential for immune effector 
functions of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) are considered to be low which is supported by the binding data which suggested little FcγR 
binding by tralokinumab. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology studies were performed as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys in line with ICH S6 (R1). Clinical examinations revealed no effects on the central 
nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical PD drug interactions studies have been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Several Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods were developed to measure the levels 
of free tralokinumab which demonstrated acceptable precision and accuracy. The lower and upper 
limits of quantitation (LLOQ and ULOQ) for the different methods were in the range of 0.1 µg/ml- 6.4 
µg/ml for the IL-13 capture method and 10-1500 ng/ml and 0.6-50 µg/ml for the methods based on 
anti-idiotype antibody.  
For the detection of antibodies against tralokinumab, initially an ELISA method for monkey serum was 
used. Subsequently, a more sensitive and drug tolerant homogenous electrochemiluminescence (ECL) 
assay was developed (screening and confirmatory assay) and validated on the Meso Scale Discovery 
(MSD) platform. The assays were selective and the sensitivity of the screening ECL-based anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) assay was 241.2 ng/mL. Drug tolerance assessment showed that 75% and 92% high 
positive control and low positive control could be detected in the presence of 100 and 10 μg/mL 
tralokinumab, respectively.  
An assessment of the PK following repeated administration was performed as part of the repeat dose 
toxicity and fertility studies with IV dosing for up to 26-weeks and SC dosing for up to 13-weeks. With 
weekly IV administration, no significant differences were seen between the sexes and exposure, both 
Cmax and AUC, increased in a dose dependent manner from 10 to 100 mg/kg, the top dose used. In the 
26-week study, accumulation of 3-6 fold was seen and the t1/2 was 12 days for recovery animals. The 
toxicokinetic measured in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys as part of pre and post-natal development 
studies were comparable to that seen in non-pregnant females. Significant exposures were detected in 
the infants suggesting that transplacental distribution occurred. 
The clinical route of administration is SC injection, however, the data with this route is more limited 
and no assessment of the bioavailability has been performed with this route. Nevertheless, the studies 
performed with this route suggest that absorption is slow with the Tmax seen between 3 and 5 days 
post dosing. Furthermore, the exposures measured were in excess of that seen via IV dosing. Data 
from fertility studies suggested that steady state exposure was reached after 9 weeks. Anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs) to tralokinumab were measured and in general were found in few animals, which 
also included control animals, and were not thought to have affected exposure levels. However, there 
were some concerns raised by CHMP regarding the reliability of these conclusions taking into account 
the findings of ADAs in control animals. These are further discussed in the toxicology section. 
No dedicated distribution studies have been performed which is considered acceptable for a monoclonal 
antibody targeting a soluble cytokine. In a PK study the volume of distribution was measured following 
a single IV administration of 10 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. No differences were seen between the 
sexes and a volume of distribution of 85 mL/kg was measured. Distribution into the breast milk has not 
been studied but considering that tralokinumab is an IgG4 antibody it would be expected to be low. 
Tralokinumab is a large protein above the glomerular filtration cut-off threshold and primarily 
eliminated by proteolytic catabolism that results in smaller peptides and amino acids. Therefore, no 
studies on metabolism or excretion have been completed in line with the recommendations of ICH S6 
(R1). Similarly, as a monoclonal antibody tralokinumab is not subject to cytochrome (CYP) mediated 
metabolism.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity studies have been performed in line with the requirements of ICH S6 (R1) using 
cynomolgus monkeys as the single species in which there is relevant pharmacological activity. As 
elucidated in the pharmacology studies, the activity of tralokinumab against IL-13 of cynomolgus 
monkey origin is similar to that of human origin whilst no relevant activity of tralokinumab was seen 
against rodent IL-13.  
The pivotal toxicology studies with toxicokinetic analyses were performed in compliance with Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. 
Single dose toxicity 
In accordance with ICH S6(R1) recommendation, no dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were 
conducted with tralokinumab. However, no acute toxicity after the first dose was observed at doses up 
to 100 mg/kg IV in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in the cynomolgus monkey. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat dose toxicity studies included 4-, 13- and 26-weeks studies with weekly IV dosing at levels 
up to 100 mg/kg and weekly SC injections of up to 350 mg/injection for 4- and 13-weeks. The highest 
dose used in all studies was the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) and no tralokinumab related adverse 
toxicities were noted suggesting that tralokinumab was well tolerated. Whilst there were no apparent 
tralokinumab related effects in these studies, this could be explained by very low circulating IL-13 
levels in naïve monkeys. Affinity experiments suggest that tralokinumab has comparable activity 
against cynomolgus monkey IL-13 to that against human IL-13. 
The repeat dose toxicity studies using the SC route of administration are limited to a 28-day bridging 
study and a 13-week study with weekly administration. Given that this is the intended route of 
administration, it would typically be expected that a chronic repeat dose toxicity study would be 
included via the planned clinical route. However, the absence of this study is mitigated by a chronic 
study of 26-weeks duration via IV infusion in which no tralokinumab related adverse events were 
noted. Furthermore, the dosing regimen used in the repeat dose toxicity studies using weekly 
administration is more frequent than the indicated clinical posology of Q2W. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were performed for all of the IV and SC studies; however, the 
interval data (P-R, QRS, Q-T waves) were only evaluated in the 26-week IV and 13-week SC studies. 
No tralokinumab related effects were seen on heart rate, blood pressure or P-R, QRS and Q-T waves. 
In addition, the 26-week study included an immunophenotyping assessment which indicated that 
tralokinumab did not significantly modulate any of the immune cell populations investigated which 
including CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells and mature B cells. 
There are several instances of measured levels of ADAs to tralokinumab in control animals and even 
measured levels of tralokinumab in the control group in the 13-week study, although the measured 
levels are low. The study report suggests that these were isolated instances which were likely sample 
contaminations and the animals were not exposed to tralokinumab.  
The 4-week SC study did have an increased incidence and severity of liver and kidney fat staining. 
These findings have been suggested to be common findings in cynomolgus monkeys which is 
supported by historical control data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 25/26 
 
 
 
The toxicokinetics measured demonstrated no consistent sex differences and exposures generally 
increased in a dose dependent manner with accumulation levels of 3-6 fold after repeated 
administration. The presence of ADA to tralokinumab were seen infrequently and not in all studies. Due 
to high systemic levels of tralokinumab, not all tralokinumab-treated animals could be included for ADA 
assessment in all studies and ADAs were found in control animals of several studies (1348/058 and 
509615). However, systemic exposure levels do not appear to have been affected by the ADAs. There 
is a margin of exposure of > 10 fold from the NOEL in all of the studies based on Cmax and AUC 
comparisons.  
Genotoxicity 
No studies have been performed in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed and considering the lack of activity against IL-13 of 
rodent origin, traditional rodent studies are not possible. In line with ICH S6 (R1), a weight of evidence 
approach has been provided which suggests that there are no identified concerns for increased 
carcinogenic risk with the use of tralokinumab. This is based on the absence of any signal from the 
toxicity studies to suggest pre-neoplastic changes and no evidence of immune suppression. The data 
from the literature has conflicting reports of both anti-tumorigenic and pro-tumorigenic effects of IL-13 
but on balance the majority of studies suggest a pro-tumorigenic effect suggesting that inhibition of IL-
13 is not likely to result in increased malignancy.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Due to the lack of activity in rodents, fertility studies were performed as separate male and female 
fertility studies in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys using SC injections. Due to the fact that the 
studies involved the use of monkeys, the assessments were limited to macroscopic/microscopic 
analysis of the reproductive organs as well as semen evaluation in males and menstrual cycle in 
females with no mating performed or measurement of reproductive outcomes. Although the absolute 
doses used were higher in males (600 mg) than in females (350 mg) the exposures achieved were 
similar. No tralokinumab mediated effects were seen on any of the reproductive organs or the semen 
evaluation in males and menstrual cycle in females. At the NOEL in both studies there is a margin of 
exposure for males of 33 and 16 fold the Cmax and AUC respectively and 37 and 18 fold for females. 
A pilot embryo-foetal development toxicity study (Study SNBL.200.07) with once weekly IV infusion of 
tralokinumab doses at 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg was conducted in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. Doses 
were given weekly between Gestational Day (GD) 20 to 48 for a total of 5 administrations with no 
tralokinumab related effects on foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. 
Two enhanced pre- and postnatal development (ePPND) studies were performed due to the fact that 
the initial study only monitored the F1 generation until PND 28-31. Both studies were performed using 
IV administration and using the same doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg. The second study monitored the 
offspring until Day 180 post-partum and included some additional endpoints of neurobehavioral 
evaluation and a T-cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR) following keyhole limpet hemocyanin 
(KLH) challenge. In both studies there was no evidence that tralokinumab affected the number of 
embryo-foetal losses or stillbirth rates with the levels measured similar to that of the control groups or 
within the historical incidence data from the research facility. In the initial study, at the top dose group 
a shorter gestation length was noted of 155 days compared to 160 days in the controls. Following on 
Assessment report

Page 26/27 
 
 
 
from this, the means birth weight was reduced by ~15% in this group, although body weight gain was 
comparable to controls in this group after Week 5. This effect on gestation length was not seen in the 
second PPND study. No adverse effects, on the F1 neonates, were seen in either study on any of the 
developmental parameters, neurobehavioral evaluations or TDAR response to KLH challenge. There 
was clear evidence of placental transfer in both studies with neonate serum levels measured 
comparable or even in excess of maternal levels. In the second PPND detectable levels of tralokinumab 
were seen on Day 91 post-partum but was mostly below the detection limit at Day 180. At the NOEL of 
100 mg/kg in the second study the margins of exposure to that of the clinical dose of 300 mg Q2W are 
44 fold for Cmax and 17 fold for AUC. 
Local Tolerance  
A stand-alone local tolerance study was conducted in rabbits. There was no differences in the scoring 
of the injection sites for erythema and eschar formation or oedema formation between sites 
administered tralokinumab or control vehicle. Histological findings of inflammatory cell infiltration, 
myositis and myofibre necrosis at the injection sites were observed for both sites receiving 
tralukinumab and the control. These were minimal in nature and in-line with what would be expected 
for this route of administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
No stand-alone immunotoxicity studies were performed. Relevant endpoints for the assessment of 
potential immunotoxicity were included in the repeat dose toxicity studies. Immunophenotyping 
suggested no differences in the cell populations investigated following tralokinumab treatment. In 
addition, no consistent significant differences in TDAR responses to Keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) 
immunisation were seen in the male and female fertility studies in adult animals or in infants in the 
PPND. The totality of the data generated in the toxicity studies in terms of haematological analysis, 
immune organ weight and histopathological response suggested no effects on immune response 
following tralokinumab treatment. A weight of evidence-based assessment identified a theoretical 
potential safety risk of helminthic infections based on the role of IL-13 in the type-2 immune response 
to helminths, however, there was no evidence of such infections in the non-clinical studies to date. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, tralokinumab is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The non-clinical proof of concept studies for the use of tralokinumab in the treatment of AD were 
largely limited to in vitro studies which suggested that in cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts 
the use of tralokinumab can prevent IL-13 induction of inflammatory mediators and modulation of 
genes involved in the maintenance of the skin barrier. The characterisation of the cross-reactivity of 
tralokinumab against IL-13 from the non-clinical species was limited, however, binding affinity data 
has been provided for both human and cynomolgus monkey IL-13. Some functional experiments 
measuring IL-13 mediated cell proliferation have provided evidence of activity against IL-13 of monkey 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
origin but not of mouse IL-13. Although such data has not been provided,  it seems reasonable to 
assume that tralokinumab will not bind rat IL-13 considering its sequence homology to human IL-13 is 
62%, which is in the range of that seen for mouse IL-13 (55%). 
While some of the in vitro data suggest the applicability of tralokinumab in treatment of AD, no 
relevant model of AD (e.g. ex vivo or in vitro human skin models) was presented in a proof of concept 
study. The in vivo experiments are limited and were likely designed with an indication for the 
treatment of asthma, which was originally one of the clinical indications pursued for tralokinumab. 
Nevertheless, they do provide some limited evidence that the use of tralokinumab can modulate 
several aspects of a disease associated with a type II immune response. In murine models of 
inflammation, tralokinumab could inhibit inflammatory responses induced by hIL-13 and hIL-13 and 
murine IL-13 were able to elicit pro-inflammatory effects in mouse models and human cell-lines (i.e. 
TF-1) respectively. In the air pouch inflammation model, there was a finding of increased neutrophil 
infiltration into the local area when tralokinumab was injected into the air pouch, although only at the 
lowest dose of tralokinumab and considering the differences in the route and formulation used 
clinically, this is not considered of significant clinical relevance by CHMP.   
Pharmacokinetics 
Limited PK studies have been performed with the majority of the PK data derived from the 
toxicokinetics collected as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey. Such an 
approach is appropriate for a monoclonal antibody. No assessment of bioavailability has been 
performed following SC administration. However, the exposures measured using this route of 
administration are comparable to that seen using IV dosing at similar dose levels suggesting a high 
level of bioavailability using this route and therefore such studies are not considered to be necessary.  
The absence of in vitro drug-interaction studies was accepted by the CHMP. 
Toxicology 
The provided non-clinical toxicology studies are in line with the relevant ICH S6(R1) guideline. 
Tralokinumab was well tolerated in all repeat dose studies which is reflected in the absence of any 
adverse events (AEs) noted in the studies of up to 26-weeks via IV dosing and 13-weeks via SC 
injection. There were no apparent tralokinumab related effects in these studies which could be 
explained by very low circulating IL-13 levels in naïve monkeys. Nevertheless, it is arguable that ICH 
S6 (R1) suggests a chronic toxicity study of 26-weeks via the clinical route of administration i.e. SC 
injection would have been expected. The only chronic study provided is a 26-week study with IV 
dosing. However, considering that the chronic study is via IV dosing and the absence of tralokinumab 
related findings in this study, as well as the 13-week study via SC injection, suggests that a 26-week 
SC study would be of limited value for providing further safety information. Indeed, the margin of 
exposure from the NOEL, identified in the 13-week SC injection repeat dose toxicity study, to the 
clinical exposure levels at the proposed posology of 300 mg Q2W is ~ 33 fold.  
The report of the 13-week study suggested that the levels of ADAs to tralokinumab were isolated 
instances which were likely sample contaminations and the animals were not exposed to tralokinumab. 
This justification was accepted by CHMP. 
The 4-week SC study did have an increased incidence and severity of liver and kidney fat staining, 
however, there were significant deficiencies in this bridging study since no control groups were utilised 
and the study was only performed using male animals. These findings have been suggested to be 
common findings in cynomolgus monkeys which is supported by historical control data. 
A comprehensive assessment of the reproductive toxicity potential of tralokinumab have also been 
performed. Animals in the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study were relatively young (13-19 months) 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 28/29 
 
 
 
and therefore not sexually mature. Similarly, animals in the other repeat dose studies were not 
sexually mature. It is understood that this would be a rationale for conducting the male fertility study. 
It is also acknowledged that identifying sexually mature test animals for toxicology studies is not 
without its difficulties9. However, in line with ICH S6 and basic 3R principles, selecting a more mature 
test population in at least one pivotal toxicology study would exclude the need for further specific 
studies since the selected endpoints could have been assessed there as well. CHMP also agreed that 
the effect seen on gestational length seen in the initial PPND study is unlikely to be related to 
tralokinumab treatment. The results of the toxicity studies are reflected in section 5.3 ‘Pre-clinical 
safety data’ of the SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall the provided non-clinical package is sufficient to support the MAA for tralokinumab in AD. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme included 5 clinical studies in AD: a phase 2b dose-finding study 
(D2213C00001), 2 phase 3 monotherapy efficacy and safety studies (ECZTRA 1 and 2), a phase 3 
combination therapy efficacy and safety study (ECZTRA 3) and a phase 2 vaccine response study 
(ECZTRA 5).  
Furthermore, 3 clinical studies in healthy subjects and 14 clinical studies from the clinical development 
programmes in other indications are considered of relevance for safety and PK in the AD development 
programme and therefore relevant results are summarised in the report where relevant.  
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of tralokinumab was evaluated in 11 studies: 4 phase 1 studies, 4 phase 2 studies and 3 phase 
3 studies. 
During the phase 1 studies, intensive PK sampling was applied. The other studies had only a sparse 
sampling schedule. The applicant developed a popPK model including all relevant PK data. 
Tralokinumab was administered only SC and IV and various doses were used throughout these studies. 
Tralokinumab was initially developed for treatment of asthma and therefore PK parameters have also 
been presented from studies in patients with asthma. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Tralokinumab serum concentration  
Two different assays were used during clinical development to measure serum concentration of 
tralokinumab. A direct ELISA method was used during the phase I study CAT-354-0401 (asthma) and 
a sandwich immunoassay (Gyrolab platform) was used for all subsequent studies.  
The results from CAT-354-0401 provide data regarding linearity, basic PK parameters and dose 
proportionality. However, data obtained from subsequent clinical trials also contributes to this 
information. Data has been presented to support that appropriate method controls were in place at the 
time of assay performance. A summary of the validation results for this assay was provided and 
method suitability has been adequately demonstrated.   
The sandwich immunoassay (Gyrolab platform) used to evaluate samples from all subsequent trials 
was performed at three separate laboratories (MedImmune, LGC Ltd. and Covance Ltd.). Method 
validation reports have been provided from each laboratory. Method re-validation was performed upon 
the introduction of new reagents (including a new sample diluent) however, no significant changes 
were introduced to the method. The data provided supports equivalent performance of the method at 
each site.  
The method has been validated in line with the guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev 1) to address accuracy, precision, linearity, dilutional linearity, 
limit of quantification, tolerance (impact of ADA antibodies on assay performance), stability of reagents 
and sample stability. The tolerance of the method has been established at 10.0 ng/ml ADA and data 
has been presented to support that tralokinumab exposures for subjects showing positive ADA 
responses is comparable to the geometric mean exposure in patients showing negative ADA responses. 
This indicates a lack of interference from ADA. It has been confirmed that samples were processed and 
stored in accordance with the established conditions for which stability has been demonstrated. The 
results of incurred samples reanalysis were provided for LGC Ltd. and Covance and demonstrated that 
the method provided consistent results.   
ADA assays 
In accordance with the draft Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived 
therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev.1), the presence of ADAs were evaluated 
using the recommended three tiered approach: an initial screening assay to identify potentially ADA 
positive samples, a confirmation assay based on competition with exogenously added tralokinumab 
and a determination of the titre of ADA for confirmed positive samples.  
Three ADA assays were used during development; the original AstraZeneca ADA assay, the updated 
AstraZeneca ADA assay and the LEO ADA assay. Only the updated AstraZeneca ADA assay and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 38/39 
 
 
 
LEO ADA assays were used for testing serum samples from AD studies and therefore these methods 
were the main focus of assessment. 
The ADA assay was based on the MSD platform where ADAs form a bridge between biotinylated 
tralokinumab and sulfo-tagged tralokinumab which is detected by measuring the resulting 
chemiluminescent signal. The confirmation assay used an excess of unlabelled tralokinumab. For the 
titre assay, samples are serially diluted to identify the highest dilution still giving a positive signal. 
For both ADA assays, the establishment of the screening and confirmation assay cut-points were 
explained. The positive control was a mouse monoclonal antibody which showed neutralising activity 
against tralokinumab. Different false positive rates were used for determination of the confirmation 
cut-point in both assays, however the Applicant has justified that this did not lead to any differences in 
the positivity rate. 
For both assays appropriate details of method validation were provided. The assays were validated for 
intra-assay precision, inter-assay precision, sensitivity, drug tolerance, selectivity, hook effect, and 
stability. 
Both ADA assays were shown to be sufficiently precise with CVs ≤25%. While the sensitivity of the 
assays is considered acceptable, at the therapeutic dose, the upper range for ~Cmax (mid-dosing 
interval concentration at Week 15) in the ECZTRA 1 trial was 341 ug/ml, compared to the 
demonstrated assay tolerance of 200 µg/ml. Overall, 64 samples tested for ADA had tralokinumab 
serum concentrations > 200 µg/mL. This corresponds to 0.2 – 0.8% of all ADA samples from ECZTRA 
1, 2, 3 and 5.  
NAb assays 
The neutralising antibodies (Nab) assay used a ligand binding format and, as for the ADA assays, two 
separate NAb assays were developed, the LEO NAb assay and the Updated AZ NAb assay. The 
Applicant highlighted that a cell-based format was also explored but that the sensitivity was not 
sufficient. It is therefore acceptable to measure NAb using a ligand binding assay. The assay is based 
on the competition of NAbs with IL-13 for tralokinumab binding. 
Details of the determination of cut-points have been provided, using serum from AD subjects. The NAb 
assays were validated for intra-assay precision, inter-assay precision, sensitivity, drug tolerance, 
selectivity, hook effect and stability.  
The assays were shown to have a sufficient level of precision at CV ≤20%. At the low positive control 
level, the LEO NAb assay was intolerant to tralokinumab. However, the Applicant has justified that the 
assay is capable of detecting NAb positive samples in the presence of levels of tralokinumab. up to 164 
µg/mL. This is in excess of the experimentally determined tolerance of 25 µg/ml using the mouse 
monoclonal positive control antibody. It can therefore be accepted that the presence of tralokinumab in 
samples is unlikely to have a large impact on the false negative rate. 
Population PK analysis 
Tralokinumab serum concentration–time data collected from 10 clinical trials, including 3 phase 1 trials 
(CAT-354-0703, MI-CP224, and CAT-354-0602), 4 phase 2 trials (MI-CP199, CD-RI-CAT-354-1049, 
D2213C00001, and ECZTRA 5) and 3 phase 3 trials (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3), were used 
for the popPK analysis of tralokinumab in healthy subjects, subjects with asthma, and subjects with AD 
following IV or SC administration. The combined dataset included 13,361 serum concentrations of 
tralokinumab from 2,561 subjects. 
The final popPK model was a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination from 
the central compartment, with log-normal IIV on volume (V2) and clearance (CL), and a combined 
Assessment report

additive and proportional error model. Covariates included in the final model were body weight on 
volume (V2 and V3) and clearance (CL and Q) with estimated allometric exponents of 0.783 and 
0.873, respectively, non-ECZTRA trials on V2 and CL, and dilution on F and ka.  
The final popPK model was used for a series of simulations including evaluating the influence of a 
loading dose on the time to reach steady state and comparing tralokinumab exposure after multiple 
dosing of 300 mg Q2W with 300 mg Q4W. 
• 
Impact of a loading dose on time to reach steady state  
The concentration–time profile was simulated for a typical subject dosed with tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W with and without a 600 mg loading dose. Steady state (90% of steady state) is predicted to be 
reached at Week 6 with a loading dose and at Week 10 without a loading dose (Figure 1).

Healthy volunteers’ studies 
Study MI-CP224 was a phase 1 randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose 
study in healthy Japanese men and women, conducted at a single site in the USA. Three dose levels of 
tralokinumab (150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg) were studied in 3 sequential dose cohorts. Within each 
dose cohort, subjects were randomised in an 8:2 ratio to a single SC dose of tralokinumab or placebo. 
Subjects were followed up for 10 weeks post-dose for assessment of PK, safety, and immunogenicity. 
Study CAT-354-0703 was a phase 1 randomised, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose trial in healthy 
men, conducted at a single site in the USA. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to a single dose 
of tralokinumab 150 mg via a 30-minute IV infusion or tralokinumab 150 mg or 300 mg via SC 
injection. Subjects were followed up for at least 8 weeks post-dose for assessment of PK, safety, and 
immunogenicity. 
The PK parameters are summarised in Table 2 for study MI-CP224 and in Table 3 for study CAT-354-
0703.

In study CAT-354-0703, the absolute bioavailability of tralokinumab after SC injection – calculated by 
comparing the AUC0-∞ values - after a single SC dose and a single IV dose was 62% (90% CI: 48.5–
79.6) for the 150 mg dose and 60% (90% CI: 46.9–77.1) for the 300 mg dose. It should be noted that 
the bioavailability might have been underestimated, given that the mean body weight was higher for 
subjects in the SC group (87.3 ± 8.1 kg) than for subjects in the IV group (78.7 ± 14.7 kg), and that 
exposure of tralokinumab decreases with increasing body weight, as shown by popPK modelling.  
In the popPK analysis, bioavailability of tralokinumab was estimated to 76.1%. The mean t½ and CL 
were similar after both SC doses and the IV dose. 
Steady-state concentrations were achieved by week 16 following a 600 mg starting dose and 300 mg 
every other week. Across clinical studies (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3), the mean ±SD 
steady-state trough concentration ranged from 98.0±41.1 mcg/mL to 101.4±42.7 mcg/mL for 300 mg 
dose administered every other week. 
In both studies (Study MI-CP224, Study CAT-354-0703) , there was a dose-proportional increase in 
systemic drug exposure and no ADA were detected in any subjects. 
Asthma studies 
Study CAT-354-0401 was a phase 1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending 
dose trial in men with mild asthma, conducted at a single site in the UK. Six dose levels of 
tralokinumab (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg) were studied in 6 
sequential dose cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects were to be randomised in a 5:1 ratio to a single 
dose of tralokinumab or placebo, administered as a 30-minute IV infusion. Subjects were followed up 
for 12 weeks post-dose for assessment of PK, safety, and immunogenicity, and then every 4 weeks 
until tralokinumab was no longer detectable in serum. 
Study CAT-354-0602 was a phase 1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose trial 
in adults with moderate asthma, conducted at 2 sites in the UK. Three dose levels of tralokinumab (1 
mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) were studied in 3 sequential dose cohorts. Within each cohort, 
subjects were to be randomised in an 8:2 ratio to tralokinumab or placebo, administered as a 30-
minute IV infusion on 3 occasions, 4 weeks apart. After their last dose, subjects were followed up for 
13 weeks for assessment of PK, safety, PD, and immunogenicity. 
Study MI-CP199 was a phase 2a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at 
multiple sites in 5 European countries, in adults with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe, persistent 
asthma. 194 subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 dose cohorts (tralokinumab 150 mg, 300 
mg, or 600 mg SC). Within each cohort, subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to tralokinumab or 
placebo. Subjects were dosed Q2W for 14 weeks, then followed up for 12 weeks after the last dose for 
assessment of PK, safety, and immunogenicity. 
Study CD-RI-CAT-354-1049 was a phase 2b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 
conducted at multiple sites in 15 countries, in adults with uncontrolled, severe asthma requiring 
concomitant treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists. 452 
subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 2 cohorts: Q2W for 52 weeks (with last dose at Week 51), 
or Q2W for 12 weeks followed by Q4W for 40 weeks (Q2/4W, with last dose at Week 49). Within each 
cohort, subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to tralokinumab 300 mg SC or placebo. Subjects were 
followed up for 24 weeks after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) for assessment 
of PK, safety, and immunogenicity. 
The PK parameters are summarised in Table 4 for study CAT-354-0401, Table 5 for study CAT-354-062 
and Figure 3 for study MI-CP199.

Systemic exposure to tralokinumab, as assessed by Cmax and AUC0-∞, appeared to increase in a dose-
proportional manner for the doses from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. For the last dose increase from 10 to  
30 mg/kg, there was a tendency for supra-proportional increase in AUC0-∞. 1 subject had a positive 
result for ADAs pre-dose but not post-dose. No subject had a negative pre-dose and positive post-dose 
sample. Thus, there was no evidence of immunogenicity induced by tralokinumab.

Figure 3 Trial MI-CP199: trough concentrations of tralokinumab after subcutaneous dosing (150, 300, 
or 600 mg) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks 
Serum trough concentrations of tralokinumab increased in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in 
Figure 3. Within each dose group, the concentrations were comparable for the last 2 doses, indicating 
that steady state was reached. No evidence of immunogenicity was observed in any subject during the 
trial. 
In study CD-RI-CAT-354-1049, at Week 13, the mean serum trough concentrations of tralokinumab 
were comparable in the 300 mg Q2W group (76.6 μg/mL) and the 300 mg Q2/4W group (66.2 μg/mL). 
After the switch at Week 13 from Q2W to Q4W in the Q2/4W group, the mean trough concentration at 
Week 25 in this group was approximately half (32.3 μg/mL) that at Week 13, consistent with linear PK. 
Mean trough concentrations were comparable from Week 13 to Week 53 for the 300 mg Q2W group 
and from Week 25 to Week 53 for the 300 mg Q2/4W group, indicating that steady state was reached. 
Tralokinumab accumulated after multiple dosing, as assessed by trough concentrations; the ratio of 
mean trough concentrations at Week 13 versus Week 5 ranged from 1.40 to 1.58. Six subjects (2.0%) 
dosed with tralokinumab and 7 subjects (4.6%) dosed with placebo had confirmed post-dose ADA-
positive samples. Antibody titres ranged from 1–5 in the subjects with ADA-positive samples in the 
tralokinumab groups. The observed presence of ADAs did not influence the PK of tralokinumab; this 
could be attributable to the low antibody titres or to a transient response.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of tralokinumab has been determined in 4 clinical trials (Table 6).

Based on the final popPK model, the estimated CL was 0.149 L/day and mean (SD) half-life was 
estimated to be 22 days for a typical AD subject weighing 75 kg. In phase 1 trials with IV dosing, 
clearance was estimated to be between 0.179 and 0.211 L/day. 
No specific excretion or metabolism studies were conducted. As a monoclonal antibody, tralokinumab 
is not expected to undergo significant renal or hepatic elimination. Tralokinumab is expected to 
degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK of tralokinumab was found to be linear, with a dose-proportional increase in drug exposure 
between 45 mg and 600 mg. After administration of a loading dose of 600 mg and subsequent 300 mg 
Q2W of tralokinumab steady state was reached after 16 weeks of treatment. The trough concentration 
at Week 16 ranged from 81 and 91 µg/mL. Tralokinumab accumulated after multiple dosing, as

assessed by trough concentrations; the accumulation factor is approximately 1.5 fold. A dosing 
regimen of 300 mg Q4W resulted in a mean trough concentration of approximately half of that 
observed for the 300 mg Q2W regimen. This is consistent with the simulations based on the popPK 
model and is consistent with linear PK. 
Figure 4 ECZTRA 1, 2, and 3: mean serum concentrations of tralokinumab after subcutaneous dosing 
(300 mg) every 2 or 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based on the Ctrough values at steady state (Weeks 14 and 16) in the phase 3 mono therapy trials 
(ECZTRA 1 and 2), the intra-subject variability (CV%) was estimated to 23.4%. This is in accordance 
with the proportional residual error estimated in the popPK model (CV% = 21.6%). 
In the population PK analysis, the estimated inter-individual variabilities of clearance (CL) and volume 
of the central compartment (V2) were moderate, with a CV% of 31.3% for CL and 40.1% for V2. In 
the ECZTRA 1 trial, inter-individual variability in trough concentrations at Week 16 was moderate to 
high (CV 66.1%). 
Integrated analysis of immunogenicity 
For the integrated analysis of immunogenicity in AD, the anti-drug antibodies (ADA) ECZTRA analysis 
set was applied including data from all subjects treated in the ECZTRA 1, 2, 3, and 5 trials. 
Incidence of ADA 
In ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, ECZTRA 3, and the vaccine-response study, the incidence of ADA up to 
16 weeks was 1.4% for patients treated with tralokinumab and 1.3% for patients treated with placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 47/48 
 
 
 
 
Among the 1939 subjects treated with tralokinumab at any time point, 84 (4.3%) subjects had 
treatment-emergent ADA and 2 (0.1%) subjects had treatment-boosted ADA. Thus, the ADA incidence 
for the entire trial period was 4.6% among tralokinumab-treated subjects. For 14 (0.9%) of these 
subjects, the response was persistent. Among the 629 tralokinumab-naïve subjects, 9 (1.4%) subjects 
had treatment-emergent ADA and none had treatment-boosted ADA. For all subjects in the ADA 
ECZTRA analysis set with positive ADA status, ADA titres were generally low, ranging from <10–640. 
There was no obvious pattern in the development of ADA across the different trial periods. 
Furthermore, there was no indication of increased development of ADA upon re-treatment, that is, 
after initial treatment with tralokinumab, maintenance treatment with placebo, and subsequent 
transfer to open-label treatment with tralokinumab. 
Incidence of neutralising antibodies (NAb) 
18 (1%) of the 1939 tralokinumab-treated subjects and 3 (0.5%) of the 629 tralokinumab-naïve 
subjects in the ADA ECZTRA analysis set were positive for NAb. For all of the 18 tralokinumab-treated 
subjects positive for NAb, the response was treatment-emergent.  
Special populations 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the PK 
of tralokinumab. As a monoclonal antibody, tralokinumab is not expected to undergo significant renal 
or hepatic elimination. 
In the popPK analysis, mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR of 30–89 mL/min) was not found to 
have a clinically relevant effect on tralokinumab exposure. Very limited data were available in subjects 
with severe renal impairment (only 1 subject included in the popPK analysis). Mild hepatic impairment 
was not found to affect the PK of tralokinumab. Very limited data were available in subjects with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment (9 subjects included in the popPK analysis). 
Gender, race and age 
In the popPK analysis, sex, race and age were not found to have a clinically relevant effect on 
tralokinumab exposure. Clinical studies included subjects aged from 18 to 92 years, and 131 subjects 
in the popPK analysis were ≥65 years of age.

The popPK analysis identified body weight as a statistically significant and clinically relevant covariate 
affecting clearance and volume parameters. Using the final popPK model, simulations were conducted 
for all subjects in the ECZTRA trials to evaluate the effect of body weight on tralokinumab exposure 
(AUCWeek 14-16). As shown in Figure 5, there is a clear correlation between exposure and body weight. 
The difference between the predicted median exposure of Q1 [1941 μg.day/mL] and Q4 [1125 
μg.day/mL]) was <2-fold.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal PK drug interaction studies were conducted with tralokinumab. It is not expected that 
tralokinumab will directly interact with other drugs. However, since AD is associated with elevated pro-
inflammatory cytokines, and increased levels of certain cytokines during chronic inflammation can alter 
the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, there is potential for a disease-drug interaction. 
This potential interaction is elucidated in an ongoing clinical trial in AD patients (LP0162-1342).  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tralokinumab is a monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that specifically neutralises the IL-13 
cytokine by inhibiting the interactions with the IL-13 receptors (IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2). IL-13 is an 
immunoregulatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. 
Primary pharmacology 
The tralokinumab biomarker programme in subjects with AD was aimed at investigating the mode of 
action of tralokinumab in skin and blood. The programme included exploratory analyses of molecular, 
cellular, and microbial markers in serum or skin that are related to AD or to the activity of 
tralokinumab in subjects with AD. The phase 3 trial ECZTRA 1 was pivotal to these analyses and 
provided most of the data. The phase 2b dose-finding trial D2213C00001 provided supportive data. In 
addition, the phase 3 trials ECZTRA 2 and 3, along with the phase 2 trial ECZTRA 5, provided data for 
2 of the serum biomarkers (IgE and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)).

Serum biomarkers 
In the phase 2b dose-finding trial D2213C00001 as well as in the pivotal phase 3 trial ECZTRA 1, 
subjects receiving tralokinumab Q2W had reduced levels of the Th2-related serum biomarkers 
chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and periostin already from Week 4, with further reductions at Week 12 
or Week 16. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was only minimally affected, with an increase in the median 
serum concentration at Week 12 or Week 16 compared with baseline. 
Across the phase 2b and pivotal phase 3 trials, serum levels of IgE were reduced at Week 12 in 
subjects receiving tralokinumab compared with subjects receiving placebo, whereas lactic acid 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were only marginally reduced. A similar pattern for IgE and LDH was 
observed in ECZTRA 5. 
The results for the serum biomarkers that were measured in at least 2 of the phase 2b and pivotal 
phase 3 trials in AD are summarised in Table 9.

as in ECZTRA 1. The pattern of results was consistent across the 2 trials: S. aureus colonisation was 
significantly reduced at Week 12 (D2213C00001) and Week 16 (ECZTRA 1) in subjects receiving 
tralokinumab compared with subjects receiving placebo. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No secondary clinical pharmacology studies were performed with tralokinumab. Please see the non-
clinical section. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
The PD interactions between tralokinumab and two vaccines was assessed in Study LP0162-1341 
(ECZTRA 5): a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with moderate-
to-severe AD. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority of tralokinumab 
versus placebo with respect to immune responses to concomitantly administered vaccines based on a 
pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 25%. The trial assessed immunisation responses against 2 non-live 
vaccines, a combined Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine and a meningococcal vaccine.

Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo Q2W (administered SC) 
for 16 weeks, following an initial loading dose (tralokinumab 600 mg or placebo). At Week 12, subjects 
received 1 dose of each vaccine before the administration of tralokinumab or placebo. 
The percentage of subjects achieving each of the primary endpoints, positive anti-tetanus response 
and positive anti-meningococcal response at Week 16, was similar in the tralokinumab group and the 
placebo group (Table 10). For the estimated difference in response rate, the lower limit of the 95% CI 
was greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -25%, demonstrating non-inferiority of 
tralokinumab versus placebo with respect to immune responses to concomitantly administered, non-
live vaccines.

Exposure-response analysis (phase 2b study D2213C00001) 
The phase 2b trial D2213C00001 evaluated 3 doses of tralokinumab versus placebo, administered SC 
with concomitant use of TCS in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The doses were 45 mg, 150 mg, 
and 300 mg (Q2W).

Individual Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores were stratified by individual tralokinumab 
serum concentration quartiles. As shown in Figure 6 subjects within the 75th exposure percentile (Q4) 
had best efficacy scores at Week 12. The trough concentration threshold characterising this subgroup 
of subjects with the highest exposure was 59.2 mg/L tralokinumab. 70% of the subjects in this 
subgroup received 300 mg Q2W, and the remaining 30% received 150 mg Q2W; no subject receiving 
45 mg Q2W reached the threshold for the subgroup.

Exposure-response analysis (phase 3 ECZTRA trials)  
Exposure data and selected response data up to Week 16 were provided from the phase 3 trials 
ECZTRA 1 and 2 (monotherapy pool) and ECZTRA 3 (tralokinumab–TCS combination trial). A total of 
963 subjects were included in the ECZTRA 1+2 exposure-response (ER) analysis dataset and 334 
subjects were included in the ECZTRA 3 ER analysis dataset. 
Exposure-efficacy quartile analysis  
The number of subjects per quartile and the quartile ranges for ECZTRA 1 + 2 are provided in Table

Table 11 ECZTRA 1+2: Number of subjects stratified and quartiles by exposure variable and body 
weight 
A clear relationship was observed between exposure (Ctrough and AUC) and efficacy (EASI and IGA 
response). At Week 16, the subjects within the lowest exposure quartile (Q1) had the lowest response, 
and the subjects within the highest exposure quartile had the highest response (Table 12). 
Table 12 ECZTRA 1+2: EASI and IGA responses at week 16 stratified by quartiles of body weight, 
model-predicted AUC, and tralokinumab trough concentration 
Stratification of individual ΔEASI% by body weight showed that subjects in the lowest body weight 
quartile had a modestly improved efficacy response compared with subjects in the highest body weight 
quartile (ΔEASI% at Week 16: 5.8). However, the difference in ΔEASI% at Week 16 between the 
lowest and highest quartile was less pronounced for body weight than for AUC (-9.1) and Ctrough (-
13.6). 
In the quartile analysis of ECZTRA 3, which included concomitant TCS treatment, the relationship 
between tralokinumab exposure and reduction in EASI score was consistent with the monotherapy pool 
(Table 13).

Exposure-efficacy model analysis 
The analysis dataset contained 1482 data pairs (Ctrough, ΔEASI%) and 963 data pairs (AUC, ΔEASI%) 
from 963 subjects.  
An Emax (estimated maximum effect) model was found to provide the best description of the 
relationship between efficacy and steady state exposure metrics. Race (Black or African American 
(BAA)/non-BAA) was found to have a significant effect on the E0, consistent with a higher placebo 
response in the BAA population than in non-BAA populations. Baseline EASI score was also found to 
have a significant effect on EC50, predicting that subjects with severe AD will have a lower level of 
response at the same exposure level compared with subjects with less severe AD. 
The parameter estimates for the final model for the Ctrough metric are shown in Table 14. The visual 
predictive check (VPC) for the final Ctrough model is shown in Table 15. For the typical subject (non-BAA 
and baseline EASI score of 25), the steady state Ctrough exposure estimated to achieve half of 
maximum treatment response was 37.8 μg/mL.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The bioanalytical methods used to measure the serum concentration of tralokinumab (direct ELISA 
method and sandwich immunoassay) were considered sufficiently validated by CHMP.  
No incurred samples reanalysis was performed at MedImmune which is accepted given that the same 
method was applied at LGC Ltd. and Covance and taking into account the acceptable method 
validation/assay performance at MedImmune. It has been confirmed that appropriate assay 
acceptance criteria were in place for routine analytical runs and that acceptable reference standards 
(clinical batches) were used during method validation. With respect to the query raised regarding the 
robustness of the assay performance at one of the laboratories (Covance Ltd.), it has been clarified 
that these run failures related to lab technician error.  
The ADA and NAb assays were also adequate. CHMP noted the low number of samples with 
tralokinumab levels above the assay tolerance but considered that they would not have any material 
impact on the immunogenicity conclusions. The popPK analysis used for model development and 
evaluation was also considered acceptable. 
Absorption - Bioavailability 
PK data has been presented across 6 trials in healthy volunteers (2) and asthma patients (4), for a 
variety of doses and posology. Tralokinumab was administered in a similar way to the proposed AD 
dosing (i.e. 300mg every Q2W) in 2 asthma studies (MI-CP199 and CD-RI-CAT-354-1049).  
Steady state PK data (week 13 to 53) for CD-RI-CAT-354-1049 demonstrated mean Cmin values of 71.3 
to 78.4 μg/mL while for MI-CP199 the highest mean Cmin value was 86.8 μg/mL at week 13. These 
results are slightly lower than the Ctrough mean of 99.9 µg/mL from the pivotal phase 3 ECZTRA 1 trial 
in AD. For healthy volunteer studies CAT-354-0703 and MI-CP224, tralokinumab was administered as a 
single 300mg SC dose. AUC0-inf values were 1030 and 1459 μg×day/mL and Cmax values were 34.4 and 
44.8 μg/mL. 
The absolute bioavailability of tralokinumab following SC dosing was estimated by popPK analysis to be 
76%. In the healthy volunteer study CAT-354-0703, the bioavailability was estimated to be 62% for 
the 150 mg dose and 60% for the 300 mg dose following SC administration.  
The applicant considered the trial results underestimated the SC bioavailability due to differences and 
variability in the body weight across the different treatment arms. This could be plausible given that 
the popPK analysis identified body weight as a statistically significant and clinically relevant covariate.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution was estimated across 4 PK trials in healthy volunteers and asthma patients. 
In these trials, the volume of distribution, Vd, ranged from 44 to 155 mL/kg.  
A volume of distribution for tralokinumab of approximately 4.2 L was estimated by population PK 
analysis. 
The relatively small volume of distribution for tralokinumab is typical of monoclonal antibodies, which 
are largely confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces due to their large molecular size and poor 
lipophilicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 57/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
CL and t1/2 were estimated across 4 PK trials in healthy volunteers and asthma patients. In these trials, 
CL ranged from 2.2 to 3.7 mL/kg/day. T1/2 ranged from 18 to 34 days, excluding the t1/2 determined 
following the first dose in the CAT-354-0602 trial.  
In ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3, clearance was estimated by population PK analysis to be 
0.149 L/day. In phase 1 trials with IV dosing, clearance was estimated to be between 
0.179 and 0.211 L/day. 
Half-life is 22 days, consistent with the typical estimate for human IgG4 monoclonal antibodies 
targeting soluble cytokines.  
The lack of specific excretion or metabolism studies is acceptable because tralokinumab is a protein 
which is primarily cleared by proteolytic catabolism and broken down into small peptides and individual 
amino acids. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Data from study MI-CP224 suggests dose proportionality for Cmax and AUC for flat doses, SC, between 
150mg and 600mg. In contrast, data from study 354-0401 indicates Cmax estimates increased supra-
proportionally across all doses tested from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg, while AUC estimates increased supra-
proportionally from 10 to 30 mg/kg.  
Dose proportionality from other studies listed above was not discussed or analysed in detail. In 
addition, only 5 patients were tested at 30mg/kg throughout the whole clinical development 
programme.  
Therefore, the statement on linearity in section 5.2 of the SmPC stating that ‘Exposure of tralokinumab 
increases proportionally to the dose of tralokinumab between 150-600 mg’ is based on the phase 1 MI-
CP224 study.  
The data support absence of time-dependent behaviour. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
In the phase 2b study (D2213C00001), tralokinumab trough concentrations at steady state in subjects 
with AD were comparable with those observed in previous asthma studies.  
Consistent across the pivotal phase 3 studies (ECZTRA 1, 2 and 3) and the phase 2 ECZTRA 5 study, 
tralokinumab trough concentrations at Week 2 and/or Week 4 were close to the steady-state 
concentration at Week 16, which supports the use of a loading dose. Across clinical studies (ECZTRA 1, 
ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3), the mean ±SD steady-state trough concentration ranged from 
98.0±41.1 mcg/mL to 101.4±42.7 mcg/mL for 300 mg dose administered every other week. 
The mean trough concentration of tralokinumab following a switch from Q2W to Q4W reduced by 
approximately half, suggesting linear PK.  
Integrated analysis of immunogenicity 
Clinical data from the trials with tralokinumab in AD showed that the rate of ADA was low. There was 
generally no impact of ADA/NAb on PK or efficacy. However, the low number of ADA positive subjects 
limited the comparison between groups. No distinct pattern of AEs was found in the ADA/NAb positive 
subjects and no increased risk of anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions, immune complex disease, 
serum sickness, or serum sickness-like reactions was identified in the ADA ECZTRA analysis set.

Page 58/59 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
It is agreed that renal impairment, hepatic impairment, gender or age are unlikely to affect the PK of 
tralokinumab and that a dose adjustment is not warranted.  
In the popPK analysis, race (Black or African Americans, Asian and White and others) was found to be 
a statistically significant covariate on both CL and V2. Ethnicity was found to be a statistically 
significant covariate on CL. However, for both race and ethnicity, the effect on the CL or V2 was low 
and deemed not clinically relevant. Thus, no dose adjustment is warranted in terms of race. 
In the popPK analysis, the effect of body weight was statistically significant and clinically relevant 
covariate affecting CL and volume parameters. This effect results in decreasing steady-state exposure 
of tralokinumab with increasing body weight. However, simulations based on the population PK/PD 
model suggested that an increase in dose to QW for subjects with high body weight may result in only 
a small increase in treatment response. Furthermore, in the quartile exposure-safety analyses for 
conjunctivitis and respiratory tract infections, no significant trends were observed, and an exposure 
limit related to safety could not be identified. Therefore, flat dosing of tralokinumab for the Q2W 
regimen, irrespective of weight, is considered acceptable. 
Despite exposure being reduced by around half, the applicant contends that the Q4W regimen is 
adequate to maintain efficacy in subjects who achieved a clinical response at Week 16. It is 
acknowledged that maintenance treatment was not part of the exposure-response analysis and that 
the exposure-response relationship cannot be transferred to this situation. However, the reduced 
exposure in patients with a high body weight (>100 kg), coupled with the reduced exposure with the 
Q4W regimen, suggests that the Q4W regimen may not be appropriate for patients with a high body 
weight. This information has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Interactions 
No formal PK drug interaction studies were conducted with tralokinumab which was considered 
acceptable by CHMP (please see section PK ‘interactions’ section).  
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology – biomarker analyses 
The exploratory biomarker analysis of the phase 2b study D2213C00001 showed an effect of 
tralokinumab on selected biomarkers and suggested a greater effect of the 300 mg Q2W dose 
compared to lower doses. 
The biomarker sub study of the phase 3 ECZTRA 1 trial (LP0162-1325) underlines the importance of 
IL-13 in the pathophysiology of AD and the effects of treating with tralokinumab. By analysing serum 
and skin samples it was shown that IL-13 expression correlates with other inflammatory markers, skin 
colonisation with S. aureus and clinical disease severity.  
Across the pivotal phase 3 ECZTRA trials, serum levels of biomarkers known to be upregulated in 
patients with AD and to respond to treatment were shown to be reduced with tralokinumab therapy. 
Skin biomarkers associated with epidermal hyperplasia were reduced and those associated with barrier 
integrity were increased with tralokinumab treatment. Treatment with tralokinumab also reduced the 
abundance of S. aureus in lesional skin, which correlates with a reduction in disease severity of AD. 
Overall, the findings of the biomarker analyses confirm the mode of action of tralokinumab and provide 
support for the efficacy of this drug in improving disease symptoms in patients with AD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 59/60 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
The phase 2 ECZTRA 5 trial demonstrated non-inferiority of tralokinumab versus placebo with respect 
to immune responses to Tdap and meningococcal vaccines, based on the predefined non-inferiority 
margin of -25%. The results support that non-live vaccines are effective/immunogenic in adult patients 
with moderate-to-severe AD treated with tralokinumab. However, live and live attenuated vaccines 
should not be given concurrently with tralokinumab as clinical safety and efficacy have not been 
established. 
Exposure-response analyses 
The ER analysis of data from the phase 2b study (D2213C00001) showed a positive relationship 
between tralokinumab exposure and efficacy, with the highest trough concentration quartile (Ctrough 
threshold >59 mg/L) showing superior efficacy over other quartiles and 70% of subjects in this quartile 
received 300 mg Q2W. These results support the selection of the 300 mg Q2W dose for the phase 3 
development programme. 
The ER analysis from the phase 3 ECZTRA trials showed a clear positive relationship between efficacy 
and tralokinumab exposure at steady state in both the quartile and model-based analysis of the ER 
data for the 300 mg Q2W. In the quartile exposure-safety analyses for conjunctivitis, there was a trend 
for higher Ctrough levels and increased incidence of conjunctivitis, but this trend was not statistically 
significant.  
In the ER model analysis, an Emax model provided the best fit to the data. All parameters included in 
the final model were estimated with reasonably good precision (all RSE <30%). Interindividual 
variability on E0 and EC50 was reduced in the final model compared to the base model but remained 
high, particularly for EC50 (IIV 205%). Diagnostic plots generally showed an adequate fit of the model 
to the data. The VPC showed that the predictive performance of the model was adequate. Of the 
covariates tested in the ER model analysis, race (BAA/non-BAA) and disease severity (baseline EASI 
score) were found to affect the ER relationship. The response of the BAA population in the placebo 
group was almost twice as big as the response in non-BAA populations. The trough concentration 
resulting in half maximal treatment response concentration was shown to increase with increasing 
EASI score at baseline. However, simulations based on a population PK/PD model suggested only a 
minor increase in the proportion of EASI-75 responders at Week 16 after increasing the dosing 
frequency to once weekly in subjects with severe AD. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile of tralokinumab has been adequately characterised. Based on the PK-PD data presented 
in the dossier, the proposed posology of 600 mg (four 150 mg injections) followed by 300 mg (two 150 
mg injections) administered every other week as SC injection is agreed. Appropriate information 
relevant for the prescribers and patients has been included in the SmPC and package leaflet 
accordingly. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The selection of the dose for further development in AD subjects was supported by the phase 2b 
randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in adult subjects with moderate-
to-severe AD (D2213C00001). This study assessed the efficacy of tralokinumab Q2W at doses of 45, 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 60/61 
 
 
 
150 and 300 mg in terms of Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) response rate and change in 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from baseline at week 12. No significant differences 
were evident between the 150 mg and 300 mg tralokinumab treatment groups. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The clinical development programme consisted in 3 randomised phase 3 studies to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of tralokinumab as monotherapy (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2) or in combination with TCS 
(ECZTRA 3) in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. In this 
assessment report, studies ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 are discussed together since they have an almost 
identical study design whereas ECZTRA 3 is discussed separately. 
ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 
Methods 
Both studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of tralokinumab monotherapy in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for 
systemic therapy. 
The trials consisted of a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks, an initial treatment period of 16 weeks, a 
maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks in subjects who obtained a clinical response at Week 16, 
and an off-treatment follow-up period of 14 weeks for assessment of safety and ADA (Figure 7).

at least 28 days or for the maximum duration recommended by the product 
information (e.g. 14 days for super-potent TCS), whichever was shorter; 
o  Subjects with documented systemic treatment for AD in the past year were also 
considered as inadequate responders to topical treatments and were potentially eligible 
for treatment with tralokinumab after appropriate wash-out; 
o 
Important side effects or safety risks were those that outweighed the potential 
treatment benefits and included intolerance to treatment, hypersensitivity reactions, 
significant skin atrophy, and systemic effects, as assessed by the investigator or by the 
subject’s treating physician.

Treatments 
Investigational treatment 
All randomised subjects received a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 0 (baseline): 4 SC injections (each 
1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab or placebo. 
At subsequent visits in the initial treatment period, each subject received 2 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) 
of 150 mg tralokinumab Q2W or placebo Q2W to receive a total dose of 300 mg tralokinumab or 
placebo. 
Tralokinumab responders were re-randomised to an additional 36-week blinded maintenance 
treatment with: 
• 
• 
• 
Tralokinumab Q2W (2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of 150 mg tralokinumab); 
Tralokinumab Q4W (alternating dose administrations: 2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of 150 mg 
tralokinumab and 2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of placebo); 
Placebo Q2W (2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of placebo). 
Subjects (i.e. non-responders at week 16 or during the maintenance phase) who had been transferred 
to open-label treatment received 2 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab Q2W. 
Background treatment  
All subjects were required to use an additive-free, basic bland emollient twice daily (or more, as 
needed) for at least 14 days before randomisation. Subjects were not allowed to start treatment with 
prescription emollients or emollients containing additives such as ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, or 
filaggrin, unless initiated prior to the screening visit. Subjects were required to continue their 
background emollient treatment throughout the trial. 
Concomitant medication 
The following concomitant medications related to AD treatment were permitted from screening through 
safety follow-up (Week 66; Week 82 for selected Japanese subjects): 
•  Oral antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal therapy for skin infections as appropriate; 
•  Stable doses of an emollient; 
•  Oral antihistamines. 
In addition, the use of topical treatments was permitted during safety follow-up (from Week 52 or 
Week 68 for selected Japanese subjects in ECZTRA 1) at the investigator’s discretion. 
Rescue treatment 
If medically necessary (i.e. to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD could be 
provided to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator during any of the treatment periods. For 
analysis of the primary estimand for the primary endpoints, subjects who received rescue treatment 
during the initial treatment period were considered as non-responders, but they continued IMP 
treatment if the rescue treatment consisted of topical medications only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021

Use of rescue medication was recorded as concomitant medication. 
Open-label tralokinumab arm only 
From Week 16 through safety follow-up (Week 66; Week 82 for selected Japanese subjects in ECZTRA 
1)  subjects  could  use  mild  to  moderate  strength  TCS  and/or  TCI  as  needed  on  lesional  skin  at  the 
investigator’s discretion. Use of TCS and TCI was recorded as concomitant medication. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab compared with placebo in treating moderate-to-severe 
AD. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab on severity and extent of AD, itch, and Health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) compared with placebo.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints  
• 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16; 
•  75% reduction from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at Week 16. 
Secondary endpoints for the initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16)- under 
multiplicity adjustment  
•  Change in SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) from baseline to Week 16; 
•  Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline to Week 16; 
•  Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score from baseline to Week 16. 
Secondary endpoints for the maintenance treatment period – (Weeks 16 to 52 for 
responders at Week 16) - under multiplicity adjustment  
• 
• 
IGA of 0/1 at Week 52 among subjects with IGA of 0/1 at Week 16 achieved without rescue 
medication after initial randomisation to tralokinumab; 
EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects with EASI75 at Week 16 achieved without rescue 
medication after initial randomisation to tralokinumab. 
Other additional secondary endpoints can be found in Table 34 and Table 35. 
Sample size 
Assuming a screening failure rate of 25%, approximately 1040 subjects were expected to be screened 
and approximately 780 subjects were planned to be randomised 3:1 to initial treatment (585 subjects 
to tralokinumab and 195 subjects to placebo). The sample size was chosen to ensure that sufficient 
safety information was collected and that a sufficient number of responders were re-randomised to 
maintenance treatment. 
Primary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 64/65 
 
 
 
For the endpoint IGA 0/1 at Week 16, a sample size of 780 subjects randomised at 3:1 provided >99% 
nominal power to detect a difference between tralokinumab and placebo, assuming IGA 0/1 response 
rates of 30% and 10%, respectively, at a 5% 2-sided level of significance. 
For the endpoint EASI75 at Week 16, a sample size of 780 would likewise provide >99% nominal 
power to detect a difference between tralokinumab and placebo at Week 16, assuming EASI75 
response rates of 40% and 15%, respectively. 
Maintenance endpoints 
With an IGA response rate of 30% at Week 16, 175 IGA responders initially treated with tralokinumab 
were expected to be re-randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio into the maintenance treatment period (70 
subjects on tralokinumab Q2W, 70 subjects on tralokinumab Q4W, and 35 subjects on placebo). 
Assuming IGA response rates at Week 52 of 80%, 50% and 5%, respectively for tralokinumab Q2W, 
tralokinumab Q4W, and placebo, the nominal power to show a difference at the 4% significance level 
would be >99% between tralokinumab Q2W and placebo and >99% between tralokinumab Q4W and 
placebo. 
With an EASI75 response rate of 40% at Week 16, 235 EASI75 responders initially treated with 
tralokinumab were expected to enter the maintenance treatment period (94 subjects on tralokinumab 
Q2W, 94 subjects on tralokinumab Q4W, 47 subjects on placebo). Assuming EASI75 response rates at 
Week 52 of 90%, 55% and 5%, respectively for tralokinumab Q2W, tralokinumab Q4W, and placebo, 
the nominal power to show a difference at the 4% significance level would be >99% between 
tralokinumab Q2W and placebo and >99% between tralokinumab Q4W and placebo. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised to treatment with either tralokinumab or placebo in a 3:1 ratio 
(tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: placebo Q2W) in the initial treatment period. Subjects who were 
randomised to tralokinumab and achieved a clinical response at Week 16 were eligible to continue 
maintenance treatment and were re-randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio (tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W: placebo Q2W) in the maintenance treatment period. Subjects were 
assigned to the lowest available randomisation number. The subject number was a 5-digit number. A 
central Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)/interactive voice response system was used to 
control the randomisation and stratification factors (region and disease severity), along with IMP 
supply chain and expiry tracking. 
Blinding (masking) 
Since tralokinumab and placebo were visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, the IMP was 
handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded Health Care Professional (HCP) at the site who was 
not involved in the management of trial subjects and who did not perform any of the assessments.  
Statistical methods 
All subjects randomised and exposed to initial treatment were included in the full analysis set (FAS) 
and were analysed for efficacy up to Week 16.  
A maintenance analysis set was defined as all subjects who were re-randomised and exposed to 
maintenance treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 65/66 
 
 
 
A safety analysis set was defined by excluding subjects from the FAS who either received no treatment 
with IMP and/or for whom no post-baseline safety data were available. 
The statistical methodology in trials ECZTRA 1 and 2 used an estimand framework, that incorporated 2 
main types of intercurrent events (initiation of rescue medication and permanent discontinuation of 
IMP).  
The primary estimand for the primary endpoints was the treatment difference in response rates of IGA 
0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks achieved without rescue medication, resulting from initiation of a 
treatment regimen with tralokinumab compared to a treatment regimen with placebo and regardless of 
treatment discontinuation. Data retrieved at Week 16 for subjects who had permanently discontinued 
IMP prior to Week 16 was included in the analysis. Subjects who prior to the Week 16 visit had 
received rescue medication were considered non-responders, reflecting an assumption that initiation of 
rescue medication indicates failure of the randomised treatment to achieve response, and that a 
(possible) observed positive response after initiation of rescue medication is not attributable to the 
randomised treatment. Missing data for subjects who did not attend the Week 16 visit and where 
rescue medication had not been used prior to Week 16, were imputed as non-responders. 
The difference in response rates between treatment groups was analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test stratified by region (North America, Japan, and Europe) and baseline disease severity 
(IGA 3 or 4).  
Three sensitivity analyses were specified for the primary estimand: 1) All subjects who have 
permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16 were to be imputed as non-responders, even if no 
rescue medication has been used; 2) If subjects have withdrawn due to an AE or due to lack of 
efficacy, they were to be considered non-responders, data missing for other reasons were to be 
imputed using last observation carried forward; 3) a tipping point analysis using multiple imputation in 
which subjects in the tralokinumab group with missing week 16 data were considered non-responders 
while missing week 16 data for subjects in the placebo arm who did not use rescue medication were 
imputed from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p (ranging from 0 to 1). 
Supplemental `hypothetical’ and tertiary `treatment policy’ estimands were also defined for the 
primary endpoints. 
The primary estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints was the treatment difference in change 
from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD and DLQI, respectively, if all subjects adhered to the treatment 
regimen in the sense that they did not discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue medication was 
made available before Week 16. Data collected after permanent discontinuation of IMP or after 
initiation of rescue medication was not to be included in the analysis. To ensure that all subjects were 
included in the analysis, the baseline value for these subjects was carried forward as the first post-
baseline assessment, corresponding to imputing a change of 0 at the first post-baseline assessment. 
The continuous secondary endpoints were analysed using a repeated measurements model on the post 
baseline responses up to Week 16 with an unstructured covariance matrix, Kenward-Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator degrees of freedom, and the mean modelled as follows (shown 
for change from baseline in SCORAD): 
Change from baseline in SCORAD = treatment × visit + baseline SCORAD × visit + region + baseline 
IGA. 
This model assumes that data is missing at random within each treatment arm. In a sensitivity 
analysis, it was assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue treatment/receive rescue 
medication in the tralokinumab arm would resemble data from subjects from the placebo arm who did 
not discontinue treatment/receive rescue medication. Multiple imputation of missing data at Week 16 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 66/67 
 
 
 
was to be performed using a pattern mixture model where missing data in the tralokinumab arm as 
well as the placebo arm was to be imputed from the placebo arm (copy-reference approach). 
Supplemental `treatment policy’ and `composite’ estimands were also defined for the continuous 
secondary endpoints. 
For maintenance of IGA 0/1 and EASI75, the difference in response rates between treatment groups at 
week 52 was analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by region. The definition of 
the primary estimand for these endpoints was similar to that for the primary endpoints measured at 
week 16. 
For ECZTRA 1 and 2, to control the overall type 1 error rate, the primary analyses of the primary 
estimands for the primary and secondary endpoints for the initial and maintenance treatment was to 
follow a testing procedure combining sequential testing for the primary endpoints, the Holm method 
for the families of secondary and maintenance endpoints, and sequential testing within these families.

Conduct of the study 
ECZTRA 1 
There were 3 global substantial amendments to the original protocol, dated 03 March 2017. 
The first amendment (28 August 2017), assured the safety follow-up for all enrolled subjects, refined 
exclusion criteria, added one blood sample at week 4 and restricted eligible subjects for open-label 
period from IGA>1 to subjects who had both IGA>1 and not reached EASI75 reached. Amendment 2 
(12 December2017), aimed mainly to refine different efficacy endpoints and maintenance period. Last 
amendment (14 August 2018), was regarding clarifications for eligibility for open label period, home 
use trainings, TCS treatment and collection of AEs in the ongoing long term study (ECZTEND). 
Protocol deviations (PDs) were categorised as major or minor and into different categories according to 
a set of predefined categories. Major deviations were considered those related to violation of GCP, 
those that could significantly affect subject safety and wellbeing, and those that could potentially 
influence key efficacy parameters and thereby the outcome of the trial. A total of 431 major PDs were 
reported in this trial. No major PDs were reported at trial level. 4 major PDs at country-level, 20 major 
PDs at site-level and 407 major PDs at subject-level were reported during the trial (Table 16). 
In total, 240 major PDs were related to study procedures. 231 PDs were reported at subject level and 
9 PDs were reported at site level. 112/231 subject PDs constituted to various deviations in study 
procedures such as missed visits, visits performed out of window, missed assessments/procedures, or 
procedures not performed in accordance to the protocol. 
11 subjects violated inclusion criteria relating Worst Daily Pruritus NRS average score of <4 during the 
week prior to baseline. These subjects were excluded from the NRS analysis. 
The applicant stated that all protocol deviations were evaluated and considered not to impact subject 
safety or overall assessment of study results.

ECZTRA 2 
There were 4 global amendments to the original protocol, dated 17-Mar-2017. The first amendment 
(15-Jun-2017) was regarding clarifications of unblinding procedures. Last three amendments were 
similar to the amendments for ECZTRA 1 (at 28-Aug-2017, 12-Dec-2017 and 14-Aug-2018), as 
described above.   
481 major PDs were reported in this trial. There were no major PDs reported at trial level. 3 major PDs 
at country level, 22 major PDs at site-level, and 456 major PDs at subject-level were reported  
(Table 17). In total, there were 257 subject-level and 8 site-level PDs related to study procedures. 169 
subject PDs and 2 site-level PDs related to various other deviations in study procedures such as missed 
visits, visits performed out of window, missed assessments/procedures, or procedures not performed 
in accordance to the protocol. 
18 subjects violated inclusion criteria relating to Worst Daily Pruritus NRS average score of <4 during 
the week prior to baseline. These subjects were excluded from the NRS analysis. 
The applicant stated that all protocol deviations were evaluated and considered not to impact subject 
safety or overall assessment of study results.

Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics of patients recruited to the pivotal studies were similar. 
The overall mean age at baseline was 38.8 years in ECZTRA 1 and 36.7 years in ECZTRA 2. Only a 
small percentage of patients (<7%) enrolled to studies were elderly (i.e. >65 year of age). Overall, 
more than 55% of patients enrolled to the studies were men. 
Subjects were included from 3 regions (North America (US) (24.7%), Europe (59.5%) and Asia 
(Japan) (15.8%)) in ECZTRA 1 and from 4 regions (North America (23.9% from Canada and 21.5% 
from US), Europe (29.5%), Australia (15.2%) and Asia(Korea) (9.8%) in ECZTRA 2. 
The majority of subjects were White (70.3% in ECZTRA 1; 62.6% in ECZTRA 2), followed by Asian 
(20.0% in ECZTRA  1; 25.9% in ECZTRA  2) and Black or African American (7.4% in ECZTRA  1; 7.6% 
in ECZTRA  2). The mean weight and the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of all randomised subjects were 
similar in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 (i.e. 76.0 kg (range 37.0–165.0 kg) and BMI 26.0 kg/m2 (range 
15.5–61.3 kg/m2 in ECZTRA 1 and 76.1 kg (range 42.0–156.0 kg) and mean BMI 26.3 kg/m2 (range 
16.5–57.5 kg/m2) in ECZTRA 2). 
Baseline disease severity 
Disease severity and assessment at baseline were comparable between studies and between treatment 
groups.  
The mean Body Surface Area (BSA) at the baseline was 53.1% in ECZTRA 1 and 52.7% in ECZTRA 2. 
Almost equal number of patients enrolled had moderate or severe disease (IGA 3 or 4). The mean 
EASI score was 32.4 in ECZTRA  1 and 32.2 in ECZTRA  2; the mean baseline Worst Daily Pruritus NRS 
was 7.7 in ECZTRA  1 and 7.9 in ECZTRA  2. The average age of AD onset was 10.5 years of age in 
ECZTRA 1 and 8.6 years of age in ECZTRA 2; the mean duration of AD at entry into the trials was 
around 28 years in both trials (Table 18). Mean baseline DLQI was 16.9 in ECZTRA 1 and 17.7 
in ECZTRA 2; the baseline mean SCORAD score was 70.6 in ECZTRA 1 and 70.1 in ECZTRA 2, the 
baseline mean Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score was 22.8 in both trials, the baseline

mean physical component of SF-36 were 44.5 in ECZTRA 1 and 44.3 in ECZTRA 2, and the baseline 
mean mental component was 43.6 in both trials. 
Table 18 Disease severity at baseline in the pivotal trials ECTRA 1 and 2: all randomised 
In term of symptoms and quality of life, the populations in both trials had a high burden of disease at 
baseline. The proportion of subjects with asthma at baseline ranged between 38-47% while 34-40% 
had food allergy and 44-56% had hay fever.  
The most common prior AD treatments in the trials were topicals. TCS were used by 98.0% in 
ECZTRA 1 and 98.7% in ECZTRA 2 of subjects, and TCI by 50.0% in ECZTRA 1 and 46.5% in 
ECZTRA 2. Across trials and treatment groups, prior systemic AD medication included systemic steroids 
(59.4% in ECZTRA  1 and 67.4% in ECZTRA 2%), cyclosporine (36.4% in ECZTRA 1 and 33.9% 
in ECZTRA 2%), methotrexate (12.8% in ECZTRA 1 and 20.8% in ECZTRA 2%), azathioprine (5.7% in 
ECZTRA 1 and 12.2% in ECZTRA 2), mycophenolate (4.5% in ECZTRA 1 and 6.4% in ECZTRA 2) and 
other immunosuppressants (5.0% in ECZTRA 1 and 5.2% in ECZTRA ). 
The vast majority of rescue medication used was topical corticosteroids. The use of rescue medication 
was higher in subjects with severe disease at baseline than in subjects with moderate disease at 
baseline.  
Numbers analysed 
For the monotherapy trials, a total of 1596 subjects were randomised; 1196 subjects to tralokinumab 
and 400 subjects to placebo. A total of 4 subjects in the tralokinumab and 2 subjects in the placebo 
group were not dosed, resulting in a FAS of 1192 subjects for tralokinumab and 398 subjects for 
Assessment report

placebo. The monotherapy trials were characterised by a high degree of subject retention in the initial 
treatment period. Of the 1596 randomised subjects, 124 (7.8%) permanently discontinued treatment 
before Week 16 with a slightly lower discontinuation rate in the tralokinumab group (7.0%) compared 
to the placebo group (10.0%).

Primary endpoints 
• 
IGA 0/1 at Week 16 
In ECZTRA 1 and 2, 15.8% and 22.2% of subjects treated with tralokinumab achieved IGA 0/1 at 
Week 16 compared to 7.1% and 10.9% of subjects treated with placebo, respectively. The treatment 
difference between tralokinumab and placebo was slightly higher in ECZTRA 2 (11.1%) compared to 
ECZTRA 1 (8.6%). 
Treatment differences and the corresponding 95% CIs from the analyses for the 3 estimands defined 
for IGA 0/1 at Week 16 are presented in Figure 15.

For this monotherapy pool, 19.0% of subjects were responders in the tralokinumab group compared to 
9.0% in the placebo group leading to a treatment difference of 9.8% (p<0.001) based on the 
composite estimand (Figure 16).

For both ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, the proportion of EASI75 responders at Week 16 was higher in the 
tralokinumab group (25.0% in ECZTRA 1 and 33.2% in ECZTRA 2) compared to the placebo group 
(12.7% in ECZTRA 1 and 11.4% in ECZTRA 2) based on the primary analysis of the composite 
estimand (p<0.001 for both ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2). The treatment difference between 
tralokinumab and placebo was higher in ECZTRA 2 (21.6%) compared to ECZTRA 1 (12.1%). In 
general, an increase in the proportion of EASI75 responders was observed up until around Week 10-12 
with a steeper increase in the tralokinumab group compared to placebo (Figure 18).

Key secondary endpoints 
•  Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥ 4 from baseline to Week 16 
For both ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, the proportion of responders at Week 16 was higher in the 
tralokinumab group (20.0% in ECZTRA 1 and 25.0% in ECZTRA 2) compared to the placebo group 
(10.3% in ECZTRA 1 and 9.5% in ECZTRA 2) based on the primary analysis of the composite estimand 
(p=0.002 for ECZTRA 1, p<0.001 for ECZTRA 2). This leads to treatment differences of mean (95%CI) 
of 9.7 (4.4-15.0) in ECZTRA 1 and 15.6 (10.3-20.9) in ECZTRA 2 (Figure 19).

•  Change in SCORAD from baseline to Week 16 
For the monotherapy pool, there was an adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD 
of -26.5 in the tralokinumab group and -14.3 in the placebo group leading to a treatment difference of 
-12.3 (p<0.001) for the hypothetical estimand. When considering the treatment policy estimand, the 
treatment difference was -10.4 (p<0.001) with an adjusted mean change of -28.5 in the tralokinumab 
group and -18.1 in the placebo group (p<0.001) (Table 19).

•  Change in DLQI score from baseline to Week 16 
For the monotherapy pool, there was an adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 16 in DLQI of -
8.0 in the tralokinumab group and -5.0 in the placebo group leading to a treatment difference of -3.0 
(p<0.001) based on the hypothetical estimand (Table 20).

Maintenance period 
In studies ECZTRA 1 and 2, in the maintenance treatment period, 2 secondary endpoints were under 
confirmatory strategy: IGA 0/1 at Week 52 among subjects who achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 16 without 
rescue medication and EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects  who achieved EASI75 at Week 16 without 
rescue medication. 
• 
IGA 0/1 at Week 52 among subjects with IGA 0/1 at Week 16 
In ECZTRA 1, in the tralokinumab Q2W group, the proportion of subjects who maintained the IGA 0/1 
response at Week 52 was 51.3%, while in the tralokinumab Q4W group, the proportion was lower with 
38.9%. A relatively higher proportion of subjects maintained clinical response of IGA 0/1 in the placebo 
group (47.4%) compared with tralokinumab Q4W group (38.9%) (p>0.05 compared to placebo)  
(Table 22). 
Similarly, in ECZTRA 2, in the tralokinumab Q2W group, the proportion of subjects who maintained the 
IGA 0/1 response at Week 52 was 59.3%, while in the tralokinumab Q4W group, the proportion was 
lower with 44.9%. A statistically significant treatment difference compared to placebo of 34.1% 
(95%CI: 13.4 to 54.9, p-value=0.004) was only observed in tralokinumab Q2W group based on the 
primary analysis. The sensitivity analysis did not change the conclusion of the primary analysis  
(Table 22). 
• 
EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects with EASI75 at Week 16 
In ECZTRA 1, in the tralokinumab Q2W group, the proportion of subjects who maintained EASI75 
response at Week 52 was 59.6%. In the tralokinumab Q4W group, the proportion was slightly lower 
with 49.1% and lowest in the placebo group with 33.3% (Table 22). 
In ECZTRA 2, in the tralokinumab Q2W group, the proportion of subjects who maintained EASI75 
response at Week 52 was 55.8%. In the tralokinumab Q4W group, the proportion was slightly lower 
with 51.4% and lowest in the placebo group with 21.4%. The proportion of EASI75 responders at 
Week 52 was statistically significantly higher only in the tralokinumab Q2W group compared with 
placebo. The sensitivity analysis did not change the conclusion of the primary analysis (Table 22).

Given the testing hierarchy, and that IGA 0/1 at Week 52 for tralokinumab Q4W compared with 
placebo was not statistically significant EASI75 at Week 52 for tralokinumab Q4W compared to placebo 
was not evaluated with regards to statistical significance.

ECZTRA 3  
Methods 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids in subjects with moderate-to severe 
AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
The trial consisted of a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks, an initial treatment period of 16 weeks, and a 
continuation treatment period of 16 weeks. After completion of the continuation treatment period, all 
subjects, except for those who entered the open-label long-term extension trial (ECZTEND), continued 
in a 14-week off-treatment follow-up period for the assessment of safety.  
Figure 22 Trial design ECZTRA 3 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion and exclusion criteria for ECZTRA 3 were the same as for ECZTRA 1 and 2  
(see ‘Study Participants’ for ECZTRA 1 and 2). 
Patients who cannot tolerate treatment with topical corticosteroids were excluded from ECZTRA 3 
Treatments 
Initial treatment period 
In the initial treatment period, each subject received their first dose of IMP on Day 0 (baseline) as 4 SC 
injections (1.0 mL each) of 150 mg tralokinumab or placebo to receive a total loading dose of 600 mg 
tralokinumab or placebo (4.0 mL). 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 85/86 
 
 
 
 
At subsequent visits in the initial treatment period, each subject received 2 SC injections (1.0 mL each) 
of 150 mg tralokinumab Q2W or placebo Q2W to receive a total dose of 300 mg tralokinumab or 
placebo. 
Continuation treatment period 
In the continuation treatment period, each subject received either: 
• 
• 
• 
Tralokinumab Q2W (2 SC injections [1.0 mL each] of 150 mg tralokinumab); 
Tralokinumab Q4W (alternating dose administrations: 2 SC injections [1.0 mL each] of 150 mg 
tralokinumab and 2 SC injections [1.0 mL each] of placebo); 
Placebo Q2W (2 SC injections [1.0 mL each] of placebo); 
Subjects received the last dose of IMP at Week 30. 
Background treatment 
The subjects were instructed to apply a thin film of the dispensed TCS (mometasone furoate, 0.1% 
cream) once daily to active lesions from Week 0 to Week 32, as needed and were to discontinue 
treatment with TCS when control was achieved. 
Discontinuation of TCS should preferably be gradual and the duration of treatment should not exceed 3 
weeks. The safety and appropriateness of continued or repeated courses of TCS therapy was 
monitored and supervised by site staff. 
An additional, lower potency TCS or TCI could be used at the investigator’s discretion on areas of the 
body where use of the supplied TCS was not advisable such as areas of thin skin (face, skin fold areas, 
genital areas, etc.) or on areas where continued treatment was considered unsafe. 
Background treatment (emollients) 
All subjects were required to use an emollient twice daily (or more as needed) for at least 14 days 
before randomisation. The emollient should preferable be an additive-free, basic bland emollient. 
Subjects were required to continue their background emollient treatment throughout the trial 
(including during the safety follow-up period). On lesional skin, emollients should only be applied at 
times where TCS was not applied (i.e. emollients and TCS should not to be used on the same areas at 
the same time of day). On TCS-untreated areas, the emollients could be applied at all times. 
In addition to stable doses of emollient, the following concomitant medications for treatment of AD 
were permitted from Week -6/-2 (screening) to Week 46 (end of safety follow-up): 
•  Oral antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal therapy for skin infections, as appropriate; 
•  Oral anti-histamines. 
Rescue treatment  
If medically necessary (i.e. to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD could be 
provided to subjects at the discretion of the investigator. Rescue medication include topical and 
systemic treatment.  
Subjects who received topical rescue treatment (higher potency TCS: Europe Class >3; US Class >4) 
continued treatment with the IMP. 
Subjects who received systemic rescue treatment with corticosteroids or non-steroidal 
immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, etc.) 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021

were required to immediately discontinue IMP. After treatment with these medications was completed, 
treatment with the IMP could be resumed if deemed necessary. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab compared with placebo in treating moderate-to-severe 
AD. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab on severity and extent of AD, itch, and HRQoL compared 
with placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints  
• 
• 
IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16; 
EASI75 at Week 16. 
Secondary endpoints for the initial treatment phase – under multiplicity adjustment 
•  Change in SCORAD from baseline to Week 16; 
•  Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline to Week 16; 
•  Change in DLQI score from baseline to Week 16. 
Secondary endpoints for the maintenance phase  
• 
• 
IGA 0/1 at Week 32; 
EASI71 at Week 32. 
Additional secondary endpoints can be found in Table 36.  
Sample size 
Assuming a screening failure rate of 25%, approximately 492 subjects were planned to be screened 
and approximately 369 subjects were planned to be randomised 2:1 to the initial treatment; 246 
subjects to tralokinumab Q2W+TCS and 123 subjects to placebo+TCS.  
For the single endpoint IGA 0/1 at Week 16, a sample size of 369 subjects randomised 2:1 would 
provide 90% power to detect a difference between the 2 arms, assuming response rates of 30% for 
tralokinumab+TCS and 15% for placebo+TCS.  
For the single endpoint EASI75 at Week 16, a sample size of 369 would provide a nominal power 
>99.9% to detect a difference between tralokinumab+TCS and placebo+TCS, assuming EASI75 
response rates of 40% and 15%, respectively.  
The combined power for demonstrating a significant difference for both endpoints is therefore 
effectively also 90% with a sample size of 369 subjects, even when assuming no correlation between 
the 2 primary endpoints. In all cases, the evaluations were to be made with a 2-sided 5% significance 
level.

Randomisation 
At Day 0 (baseline), eligible subjects were randomised to treatment with either tralokinumab or 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio stratified by region (Europe and North America) and baseline disease severity 
(IGA 3 or 4). 
At Week 16, subjects were assigned a continuation treatment based on the initial treatment received 
and their clinical response at Week 16. Subjects initially randomised to tralokinumab who had a clinical 
response at Week 16 were re-randomised to treatment with either tralokinumab Q2W or tralokinumab 
Q4W in a 1:1 ratio stratified by region (Europe and North America) and IGA response at Week 16 (IGA 
0/1 or IGA >1). 
Subjects randomised to placebo in the initial treatment period who had a clinical response at Week 16 
continued on placebo Q2W in the continuation treatment period via blinded treatment allocation. 
Subjects randomised to either tralokinumab or placebo in the initial treatment period who had not 
achieved a clinical response at Week 16 were allocated to tralokinumab Q2W in the continuation 
treatment period. 
Subjects were assigned to the lowest available randomisation number. The subject number was a 5-
digit number. A central IWRS/interactive voice response system was used to control the randomisation 
and stratification factors. 
Blinding (masking) 
Tralokinumab and placebo were administered SC with matching injection volumes and frequencies to 
maintain blinding. However, tralokinumab and placebo were visually distinct from each other and not 
matched for viscosity. They were therefore handled and administered by a qualified unblinded HCP at 
each site who was not involved in the management of trial subjects and who did not perform any of 
the assessments. 
Statistical methods 
All subjects randomised to initial treatment were included in the FAS and were analysed for efficacy up 
to Week 16.  
A continuation treatment analysis set was defined as subjects who have not withdrawn from trial prior 
to or at the Week 16 visit. Subjects who were not exposed to continuation treatment were excluded 
from the continuation treatment analysis set. 
A safety analysis set was defined by excluding subjects from the full analysis set who either received 
no treatment with IMP and/or for whom no post-baseline safety data were available. 
Similar statistical methodology was applied in ECZTRA 3 as in the ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 studies. 
Estimand definitions and analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints measured at week 16 were 
as described for the ECZTRA1 and ECZTRA2 studies. All efficacy analyses were based on the FAS, 
except for the secondary endpoint Worst NRS reduction ≥4, which was based on subjects in the FAS 
with a baseline Pruritus NRS weekly average ≥4. 
For ECZTRA 3, to control the overall type 1 error rate, the primary analyses of the primary estimands 
for the primary and secondary endpoints for the initial treatment followed a testing procedure 
combining sequential testing for the primary endpoints, the Holm method for the family of secondary 
endpoints, and sequential testing within these families.

group. 
Results 
Participant flow 
For this trial, 507 subjects were screened. 235 subjects (92.9%) in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group 
and 120 subjects (94.5%) in the placebo+TCS group completed the initial treatment period on 
treatment. Of these, 227 subjects (89.7%) in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group and 108 subjects 
(85.0%) in the placebo+TCS group completed the initial treatment period without using rescue 
medication.

Conduct of the study 
At the time of the data cut-off for the clinical study report (27-Jun-2019), the original protocol (04-
October-2017, 0 subjects) had 3 global amendments. 
The first amendment (15-Dec-2017), was a non-substantial amendment related to an operational 
change concerning the NIMP (TCS) and its handing out to the subjects. 
In amendment 2 (10-Apr-2018), the major changes were related to the safety monitoring and 
disallowed medications. 
The latest amendment took place in 29-August-2018, to introduce the possibility for eligible subjects in 
selected countries to participate to a long-term extension trial (conducted under a separate protocol 
[LP0162-1337, ECZTEND]) without completing the safety follow-up period in the present trial. A new 
ADA assay has been developed with improved tralokinumab tolerance. This means that the presence or 
absence of ADA can be determined in serum samples with tralokinumab present. Previously, this was 
not possible and therefore ADA sampling at the end of the 14-week off-treatment safety follow-up was 
originally required for the ADA evaluation. Thus, in selected countries, the new ADA assay allowed 
eligible subjects who have completed the treatment periods of the present trial to continue into the 
long-term extension trial without completing the safety follow-up period in the present trial. These 
subjects would have their safety follow-up period after end of treatment in the long-term extension 
trial. 
196 major PDs were reported: 1 trial-level, 1 country-level, 16 site-level, and 178 subject-level major 
PDs. 4 major site-level PDs and 86 major subject-level PDs related to the assessment of safety and 
efficacy were reported.  
1 major subject-level PD led to exclusion from the per protocol analysis set and 2 major subject-level 
PDs led to permanent discontinuation of IMP.  
Baseline data 
Demographics  
Most of the subjects (93.7%) were 18–64 years at baseline. The remaining subjects (6.3%) were 65–
84 years. The mean age at baseline was 39.1 years. In the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group, men and 
women were equally distributed. In the placebo+TCS group, there was a higher proportion of men 
than women (66.1% vs 33.9% subjects). Most subjects were White (75.8% subjects) and not Hispanic 
or Latino (90.8% subjects) reflecting the regions and countries in which they were enrolled. 10.8% of 
patients were Asian and 9.2% were Black. There was a higher proportion of White subjects (80.2% vs 
66.9% subjects) and a lower proportion of Asian subjects (6.7% vs 18.9% subjects) in the

An analysis based on the PP analysis set was repeated for the primary analysis of the primary 
estimand. The result based on this analysis set supported the results based on the FAS. The estimated 
treatment difference at Week 16 was 12.4% (95% CI: 2.8 to 21.9, p=0.015), with 38.8% responders 
in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group and 26.2% responders in the placebo+TCS group. 
• 
EASI75 at Week 16 
At Week 16, the proportion of EASI75 responders was statistically significantly higher with 
tralokinumab Q2W+TCS than with placebo+TCS; the estimated treatment difference was 20.2% 
(p<0.001) with 56.0% responders in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group and 35.7% responders in the 
placebo+TCS group (primary analysis of the primary estimand).  
The primary analyses of the secondary and tertiary estimands, and all sensitivity analyses led to the 
same conclusion as the primary analysis of the primary estimand (p<0.001; all analyses).

Ancillary analyses 
ECZTRA 1 and 2 
To assess the consistency in response rates for the primary endpoints across different subgroups, IGA 
0/1 and EASI75 were analysed by the following subgroups for the monotherapy pool: age, sex, body 
weight, BMI, race, ethnicity, region, baseline scores of IGA, EASI, Pruritus NRS, and BSA, duration of 
AD, age of AD onset, previous use of systemic AD treatment, previous use of immunosuppressants, 
and relevant atopic disease history (asthma, food allergy, and hay fever). To support the interpretation 
of results for the monotherapy pool, subgroup analyses were also performed on a trial level. 
Higher responder rates were observed in the tralokinumab group compared to the placebo group for 
the vast majority of the subgroups for both IGA 0/1 and EASI75. Treatment-by subgroup interactions 
(i.e. p<0.05) were observed within race, weight, region (US versus non- US), and age of AD onset for 
IGA 0/1 as well as race and weight for EASI75. These interactions were observed in conjunction with 
high placebo responses in categories within these subgroups. 
ECZTRA 3 
To assess the consistency in response rate of the primary endpoints in relation to disease severity at 
baseline and regions, the following subgroup analyses were performed of the primary estimand 
(‘composite’):

Within each treatment group, the proportion of IGA 0/1 responders was higher in subjects with a 
moderate disease at baseline compared to subjects with a severe disease at baseline; this was more 
pronounced in the placebo+TCS group than in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group. Irrespectively of 
disease severity at baseline, the proportion of IGA 0/1 responders was higher in the tralokinumab 
Q2W+TCS group than in the placebo+TCS group. 
The corresponding subgroup analysis on EASI75 showed no marked difference in proportion of 
responders for subjects in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group whereas in the placebo+TCS group, the 
proportion of responders was higher in subjects with a moderate disease at baseline compared to 
subjects with a severe disease at baseline. 
IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week 16 by region 
Within each treatment group, there was no marked difference in proportion of responders between the 
regions North America and Europe with regards to both IGA 0/1 and EASI75.

To control the overall type 1 error rate, the primary analyses of the primary estimands 
for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints for the initial and maintenance 
treatment followed testing procedures with a testing hierarchy. The hypothesis relating 
to a specific endpoint could not be rejected unless all hypotheses relating to endpoints 
earlier in the hierarchy were also rejected. 
The testing hierarchy included the primary endpoints (IGA 0/1, and EASI-75 at Week 
16), the secondary endpoints (change in SCORAD, change in DLQI, and reduction of 
≥4-points in Pruritus NRS from baseline to Week 16), and the maintenance endpoints 
(IGA 0/1, and EASI-75 at Week 52).

Primary Analysis (16 weeks) 
Full analysis set (FAS). FAS includes subjects randomised and exposed to 
investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
Initial treatment period (at Week 16 or change from baseline to Week 16). 
For the binary endpoints, the primary estimand (‘composite’) assessed the treatment 
difference in response rate after 16 weeks achieved without rescue medication, 
regardless of treatment discontinuation. 
For the continuous endpoints, the primary estimand (‘hypothetical’) assessed the 
treatment difference in change from baseline to Week 16, if all subjects adhered to 
the treatment regimen (did not discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue 
medication was made available before Week 16).

To control the overall type 1 error rate, the primary analyses of the primary estimands 
for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints for the initial and maintenance 
treatment followed testing procedures with a testing hierarchy. The hypothesis relating 
to a specific endpoint could not be rejected unless all hypotheses relating to endpoints 
earlier in the hierarchy were also rejected.  
The testing hierarchy included the primary endpoints (IGA 0/1, and EASI-75 at Week 
16), the secondary endpoints (change in SCORAD, change in DLQI, and reduction of 
≥4-points in Pruritus NRS from baseline to Week 16), and the maintenance endpoints 
(IGA 0/1, and EASI-75 at Week 52).

Primary Analysis (16 weeks) 
Full analysis set (FAS). FAS includes subjects randomised and exposed to investigational 
medicinal product (IMP). 
Initial treatment period (at Week 16 or change from baseline to Week 16).  
For the binary endpoints, the primary estimand (‘composite’) assessed the treatment 
difference in response rate after 16 weeks achieved without rescue medication, regardless of 
treatment discontinuation.  
For the continuous endpoints, the primary estimand (‘hypothetical’) assessed the treatment 
difference in change from baseline to Week 16, if all subjects adhered to the treatment 
regimen (did not discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue medication was made available 
before Week 16).

Multiplicity 
adjustment 
The overall type 1 error rate for the primary analysis of the primary estimands for the 
primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints was protected by a combination of 
hierarchical testing and Holm-Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment. The hypothesis 
relating to a specific endpoint could not be rejected unless all hypotheses relating to 
endpoints earlier in the hierarchy were also rejected. 
The testing hierarchy included the primary endpoints (IGA 0/1, and EASI-75 at Week 
16) and the secondary endpoints (change in SCORAD, change in DLQI, and reduction 
of ≥4-points in Pruritus NRS from baseline to Week 16).

Primary Analysis (16 weeks) 
Full analysis set (FAS). FAS includes subjects randomised and exposed to investigational 
medicinal product (IMP). 
Initial treatment period (at Week 16 or change from baseline to Week 16).  
For the binary endpoints, the primary estimand (‘composite’) assessed the treatment 
difference in response rate after 16 weeks achieved without rescue medication, regardless of 
treatment discontinuation.  
For the continuous endpoints, the primary estimand (‘hypothetical’) assessed the treatment 
difference in change from baseline to Week 16, if all subjects adhered to the treatment 
regimen (did not discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue medication was made available 
before Week 16).

Analyses 
1Analysis included tralokinumab responders with IGA 0/1 at Week 16. 
Subjects who received rescue treatment or had missing data were 
treated as non-responders. The percentage is calculated relative to the 
number of subjects with response at week 16. 
2Analysis included tralokinumab responders with EASI-75 at Week 16. 
Subjects who received rescue treatment or had missing data were 
treated as non-responders. The percentage is calculated relative to the 
number of subjects with response at week 16. 
3Responders at Week16 were defined as subjects achieving either IGA 
0/1 and/or EASI-75. Subjects who received rescue treatment or had 
missing data were considered non-responders in the analyses.  
4Non-responders at Week 16 were defined as subjects who did not 
achieve either IGA 0/1 or EASI-75. 
5Data after initiation of rescue medication or permanent discontinuation 
of treatment was excluded from the analyses. Mixed model for repeated 
measures was used with fixed effect of treatment-by-week interaction, 
baseline score-by-week interaction, region and baseline IGA. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The integrated analyses were presented as pooled data from ECZTRA 1+2 (monotherapy pool), as 
these trials had identical design up to Week 52. The monotherapy pool can therefore give more precise 
Assessment report

estimates of the treatment effect of tralokinumab. The results of the primary endpoints for the 
monotherapy pool are provided in Figure 15 and Figure 17.  
In addition, subgroup analyses for the ECZTRA 1+2 studies (monotherapy pool) are presented in 
section Ancillary analyses. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No additional studies in special populations were performed. The pivotal studies only recruited adult 
patients. Only a small percentage of patients (<7%) enrolled to studies were elderly i.e. >65 year of 
age. Information in relation to patients with  renal or hepatic impairment is included in the popPK 
analyses described in the PK section of this assessment report.  
Supportive studies 
ECZTRA 5 
This was a phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult subjects with moderate-
to-severe AD. The trial was conducted in North America. 
The primary objective is presented in section ‘PD interactions with other medicinal products or 
substances’.  
The secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy of tralokinumab concomitantly administered with 
vaccines. 
The proportions of subjects achieving positive anti-tetanus response and positive anti-meningococcal 
response in tralokinumab-treated subjects (91.9% and 86.0%) were non-inferior to those in placebo-
treated subjects (96.1% and 84.2%), indicating that tralokinumab does not impair the immune 
response to non-live vaccines. 
The proportion of IGA 0/1 responders at Week 16 was higher in the tralokinumab group (31.1%) 
compared to the placebo group (19.4%) based on the primary analysis of the composite estimand 
(treatment difference 11.4%, p=0.049).  
The proportion of EASI75 responders at Week 16 was higher in the tralokinumab group (49.1%) 
compared to the placebo group (36.1%) based on the primary analysis of the composite estimand; 
however, the treatment difference (12.7%) did not reach statistical significance (p=0.057).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of tralokinumab as monotherapy and with concomitant TCS was evaluated in three pivotal 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2 and ECZTRA 3) in 1 976 
patients 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe AD defined by IGA score of 3 or 4 
(moderate or severe), an EASI score of ≥ 16 at baseline, and a minimum BSA involvement of ≥ 10%. 
Eligible patients enrolled into the three studies had previous inadequate response to topical 
medication. The eligibility criteria were adequate for the inclusion of patients with moderate to severe 
AD and comparable across the clinical studies.  
Assessment report

The ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies, which were almost identical in design, consisted of a screening period (2 
to 6 weeks), an initial treatment period of 16 weeks and a maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks 
for subjects who obtained a clinical response at Week 16. The design of ECZTRA 3 study was similar 
with the exception that the duration of the maintenance period was shorter (16 weeks instead of 36 
weeks). In addition, tralokinumab responders were not re-randomised to placebo.  
An active comparator trial was not performed although it was recommended during the scientific 
advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/590489/2016) that such trial would be beneficial in the positioning of this 
biologic in the therapeutic armamentarium for AD. The applicant stated that at the time of initiating of 
the phase 3 clinical trials none of the systemic immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, methotrexate, 
azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil) where globally approved for AD and therefore could not 
conduct such study. Despite the lack of an active comparator trial, the design of the studies is 
considered acceptable by CHMP to characterise the efficacy profile of tralokinumab in AD.  
In all three studies, patients received 1) an initial dose of 600 mg tralokinumab (four 150 mg 
injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg every two weeks (Q2W) up to Week 16 or 2) matching 
placebo. In ECZTRA 3, patients received concomitant TCS on active lesions as needed. Tralokinumab 
was administered by SC injection in all studies. 
In the monotherapy studies, subjects who achieved a clinical response at Week 16 were eligible to 
continue maintenance treatment and were re-randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive Q2W injections of 
either 300 mg tralokinumab, Q4W injections of 300 mg tralokinumab or placebo for the following 36 
weeks. Responders to placebo at Week 16 continued to receive placebo in the maintenance treatment 
period. In the combination study, subjects randomised to tralokinumab + TCS in the initial treatment 
period who had a clinical response at Week 16 were re-randomised into the continuation treatment 
period in a 1:1 ratio to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W +TCS or tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W + TCS. Patients 
with the response to placebo + TCS in the initial treatment period continued to receive placebo + TCS 
in the continuation treatment period (Week 16 to Week 32). 
The 300 mg dose was selected based on the results of the phase 2b dose finding study 
(D2213C00001) which assessed the efficacy of tralokinumab Q2W at doses of 45, 150 and 300 mg. 
Although no significant differences were evident between the 150 mg and 300 mg tralokinumab 
treatment groups, in general it is accepted that the data suggest an additive benefit of the higher dose 
and that they are supportive for the chosen 300 mg dose and Q2W posology brought forward for 
further efficacy investigation in the pivotal phase 3 studies. This was endorsed in scientific advice 
received from the CHMP/SAWP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/590489/2016). During the evaluation, the applicant 
clarified that the decision for not investigating higher doses was based on the small differences in EASI 
score changes from the baseline at Week 12 between 150mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W (mean difference 
from placebo group -4.4 and -4.9, respectively). They further stated that PK-PD simulation data 
demonstrated only a minor effect of increasing dose frequency to once weekly in terms of EASI-75 
responders. This justification was accepted by CHMP. 
The primary endpoints in the three pivotal studies were the proportion of patients with an IGA 0 or 1 
(“clear” or “almost clear”) and a reduction of a least 75% in EASI (EASI-75) from baseline to Week 16. 
These primary endpoints are considered adequate and in line with the CHMP scientific advice 
recommendation.  
There was a number of secondary endpoints in those studies; however, only few were included under 
multiplicity adjustment: change in SCORAD, reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) 
≥4 and change in DLQI score from baseline to Week 16. In the ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies, two endpoints 
for the maintenance treatment period were also included in the confirmatory testing strategy. These 
endpoints were: IGA of 0/1 at Week 52 among subjects with IGA of 0/1 at Week 16 achieved without 
rescue medication after initial randomisation to tralokinumab and EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects 
Assessment report

with EASI75 at Week 16 achieved without rescue medication after initial randomisation to 
tralokinumab. In the ECZTRA 3 study subjects received the last dose of tralokinumab or placebo at 
week 30. However, continuation treatment period endpoints were not included in the confirmatory 
testing strategy and only descriptive statistics were provided for these endpoints. Other endpoints 
included change from baseline to week 16 in POEM, at least 4-point improvement in POEM, and 
Eczema-related Sleep NRS. 
Overall the chosen primary and secondary endpoints are considered adequate by CHMP. 
Across all studies, there was a considerable number of major protocol deviations and about 25 % of 
subjects screened to these studies were affected (see sections on ‘Conduct of the study’). In addition, 
two-study sites were terminated due to concerns about GCP non-compliance and data integrity.  
The first clinical site based in the US affected one completed clinical trial (ECZTRA 3/LP0162-1339) and 
three ongoing clinical trials (ECZTRA 6, ECZTEND, ECZTRA 4). 12 subjects were randomised to the 
ECZTRA 3 study at this site. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding these 12 subjects was performed 
with no impact on the efficacy and safety. The second terminated site affected the ECZTRA 2 study. 20 
subjects were randomised at this site (12 subjects to tralokinumab Q2W and 8 subjects to placebo). 
The 20 subjects were included in the efficacy analysis in line with the intention-to-treat principle. Post-
hoc calculations showed that exclusion of the 20 subjects from the analysis would not have a 
significant impact on the efficacy and safety results. Further, in the ECZTRA studies, a per protocol 
analysis set did not exclude all patients with major protocol deviations. There were uncertainties as to 
how these protocol deviations influenced the study results in terms of both efficacy and safety. The 
applicant stated that the per protocol analysis set was pre-defined based on selected key disease-
defining inclusion criteria. Missing efficacy data were handled according to the pre-defined estimand 
strategies and approaches for handling of missing data, including sensitivity analyses.  Based on the 
responses received from the applicant in relation to protocol deviations it is not expected that exclusion 
criteria violation has caused biased in the efficacy results, or had effects on individual safety and safety 
conclusions. In addition, the criteria used to define the per protocol population are considered as 
justified. Overall, it is not expected that PDs has had a significant effect on the results and benefit/risk 
balance.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoints 
The primary endpoints (i.e. the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at Week 16 and the proportion of 
patients with IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16) were met in all three pivotal studies.  
In the primary analysis of the primary estimand in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 studies, the proportion of 
patients with IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 was higher in the tralokinumab Q2W groups (15.8% and 22.2% 
respectively) than in the placebo groups (7.1% and 10.9% respectively) with p=0.002 for ECZTRA 1 
and <0.001 for ECZTRA 2. The proportion of patients with EASI-75 at Week 16 was also higher in the 
tralokinumab Q2W groups (25.0 % for ECZTRA 1 and 33.2 % for ECZTRA 2) as compared to the 
placebo groups (12.7% for ECZTRA 1 and 11.4% ECZTRA 2). The observed differences were 
statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each).  
Similar results were observed in ECZTRA 3, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 was 
higher in the tralokinumab Q2W+TCS group (38.9%) than in the placebo +TCS group (26.2%) 
(p=0.015) and the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at Week 16 was also higher in the tralokinumab 
Q2W+TCS group (56.0%) than in the placebo +TCS group (35.7%) (p<0.001). 
Albeit statistically significant, the effect size in the monotherapy trials was considered small by CHMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 122/123 
 
 
 
The majority of patients enrolled to the monotherapy studies did not respond to treatment. Only 34 % 
of patients in ECZTRA 1 study and 41% of patients in ECZTRA 2 who completed 16 weeks of treatment 
on tralokinumab were considered as tralokinumab responders (defined as IGA of 0 or 1 or EASI-75 
score from baseline) and they were re-randomised (2:2:1) to the maintenance treatment. In addition, 
only 26% of subjects in ECZTRA 1 and 36 % in ECZTRA 2 achieved this clinical response without the 
use of rescue medications. This may have been the result of inadequate efficacy. 
The applicant was asked to discuss this poor response to tralokinumab and whether any additional 
selection criteria could be used to increase likelihood of response or identify patients more likely to 
respond to tralokinumab treatment. The relevant review was performed by the applicant. Subgroup 
analyses of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 in the monotherapy pool, did not identify any baseline characteristics 
or selection criteria that were predictive of achieving either of these outcomes at Week 16. Similarly, a 
post-hoc subgroup analysis of EASI50 did not identify any baseline characteristics or selection criteria 
that were predictive of achieving a clinically relevant reduction in EASI score at Week 16. 
In the ECZTRA 3 study which investigated tralokinumab given in combination with TCS more patients 
responded to treatment i.e. 60% of the subjects tested.  
The applicant further discussed the clinical relevance and clinical significance of the treatment effect of 
tralokinumab both as monotherapy and in combination with TCS. 
It was indicated that IGA 0/1 and EASI-75 are chosen as preferred primary outcomes in clinical trials, 
however they have outcomes with a lower threshold and that secondary endpoints (such as IGA 0/1/2 
and EASI50) are considered more informative for the evaluation of the clinically relevant effects. In the 
clinical studies, the effect size was indeed increased with lower thresholds which are considered 
relevant for clinical practice. However, CHMP considered that the increase in efficacy even after 
consideration of minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) instead of primary and secondary 
outcomes is still modest. Nevertheless, this treatment effect can still be considered as clinically 
relevant in patients who have not responded to other treatment options. Therefore, the benefit of 
tralokinumab used as monotherapy, or in combination with TCS is considered to be demonstrated. As 
better efficacy results were reported in the TCS combination trial (ECZTRA 3) as compared to 
monotherapy studies the following statement has been included in sections 4.2 the SmPC: “The use of 
topical corticosteroids, when appropriate, may provide an additional effect to the overall efficacy of 
tralokinumab”. 
Disease severity and assessment at baseline were comparable between the monotherapy studies but 
with a slightly lower disease severity in ECZTRA 3 compared to the other trials. This may have affected 
the efficacy results in favour of the combination therapy. Therefore, based on subgroup analysis 
provided by the applicant, it is assumed that differences in treatment response between ECZTRA 3 and 
monotherapy trials are mainly due to additional TCS therapy and not related to differences in baseline 
characteristics.  
Secondary endpoints 
For the initial treatment period the secondary endpoints results supported the effects seen in the 
primary endpoints. For secondary endpoints including those under multiplicity adjustment (i.e. a 
reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS of ≥4 from baseline, change in SCORAD from baseline to Week 
16-ECZTRA 1, Change in DLQI score from baseline to Week 16) statistically significantly better results 
were reported in patients receiving tralokinumab as compared to patients on placebo.  
Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline, which can be considered as 
a clinically relevant patient-reported outcome from a clinical viewpoint, has shown small favourable 
effects (12.6% and 11.3%) in monotherapy and combination therapy trials respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 123/124 
 
 
 
Consistent results were reported for the primary, secondary and tertiary estimands and all sensitivity 
analyses, although the choice of primary estimand for the continuous SCORAD and DLQI endpoints is 
not agreed as the treatment effect under full adherence to assigned treatment without receipt of 
rescue is not considered to be of primary clinical relevance. Hence, the primary estimand sensitivity 
analysis using placebo-based imputation in which data collected after permanent discontinuation of IMP 
or after initiation of rescue medication were assumed to resemble data from subjects in the placebo 
arm who did not discontinue treatment/receive rescue medication is reported in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. 
In both monotherapy studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) and in the concomitant TCS study (ECZTRA 3) 
tralokinumab improved patient-reported symptoms of AD, as measured by POEM, and the impact of 
AD on sleep, as measured by Eczema-related sleep NRS, at Week 16 compared to placebo. A higher 
proportion of patients treated with tralokinumab had clinically meaningful reductions in POEM, (defined 
as at least 4 point improvement) from baseline to week 16 compared to placebo. These endpoints were 
not included in the confirmatory testing strategy. 
Long-term efficacy 
As discussed in studies ECZTRA 1 and 2, in the maintenance treatment period, 2 secondary endpoints 
were under confirmatory strategy: IGA 0/1 at Week 52 among subjects with IGA 0/1 at Week 16 and 
EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects with EASI75 at Week 16, whereas in ECZTRA 3 only descriptive 
statistics were provided for these endpoints. 
The number of patients enrolled to the maintenance periods was smaller than planned due to the fact 
that only tralokinumab or placebo responders were transitioned to these periods and the percentage of 
responders was smaller than expected. Therefore, the maintenance period endpoints were likely to be 
underpowered.  
In the ECZTRA 1 study, percentage of responders in the Q2W group was only slightly higher when 
compared to placebo and the difference was not statistically significant (6.0% difference for IGA 0/1 at 
Week 52 endpoint and 21.2% difference for EASI75 at Week 52 endpoint in the primary analysis of the 
composite estimand). 
Better results were reported in ECZTRA 2 study. In this study, 34.1% more responders for IGA 0/1 at 
the Week 52 endpoint (p=0.004) and 33.7 % more responders for EASI75 at the Week 52 endpoint 
(p=<0.001) were seen in the Q2W group as compared to the placebo group on the risk difference 
scale.  
In the ECZTRA 3 study, subjects received the last dose of tralokinumab or placebo at week 30. The 
continuation treatment period endpoints were not included in the confirmatory testing strategy and 
only descriptive statistics were used for these endpoints. For this reason, no firm conclusion can be 
drawn in relation to long term efficacy from this study. It seems, however, that the majority of 
responders at Week 16 maintain their response up to week 32. 
An additional long-term data will be provided in the ongoing PASS (ECZTEND). 
Q4W dose regimen 
In ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies, the Q4W dose regimen was found to be less efficacious as compared to the 
Q2W regimen. For the Q4W dose regimen, a statistically (nominally) significant difference was only 
reported for the EASI75 at Week 52 endpoint in the ECZTRA 2 study (within endpoints under 
multiplicity adjustment). Lower efficacy as compared to the Q2W regimen was also observed for the 
vast majority of other endpoints investigated in these studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 124/125 
 
 
 
Based on the results on IGA0/1 and EASI75 in the monotherapy pool, efficacy of maintenance 
treatment with tralokinumab in the Q4W dosing regimen can be accepted, however the probability of 
maintaining clear or almost clear skin may be lower with every fourth week dosing. This is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
In addition, for some subpopulation of patients tapering the dose to every fourth week may not 
appropriate. The reduced exposure in patients with a high body weight (>100 kg), coupled with the 
reduced exposure with the Q4W regimen, suggests that the Q4W regimen may not be appropriate for 
patients with a high body weight. This is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
In ECZTRA 3, the continuation treatment period endpoints were not included in the confirmatory 
testing strategy and only descriptive statistics were used for these endpoints. For this reason, no firm 
conclusion can be drawn in relation to the efficacy of the Q4W dose regimen based on the results of 
ECZTRA 3 study.  
The applicant was asked to clarify if there were any cases of rebound i.e. a significant worsening of the 
disease after stopping the treatment with tralokinumab. The applicant identified two 2 out of 132 who 
met or were on their way to meeting the conservative EASI-based rebound criterion. However, as none 
of these subjects reported worse itch or a higher impact of their AD on sleep compared to baseline the 
applicant did not consider any subjects to have experienced a true rebound effect following 
discontinuation of tralokinumab. It is agreed that information on patients with potential rebound effects 
is limited and therefore it is agreed to not include this information in the SmPC. However, these cases 
should be monitored in the post-marketing setting. 
Open-label treatment 
Subjects who did not achieve a clinical response at Week 16 as well as subjects who did not maintain 
adequate clinical response during the maintenance treatment period were transferred to open-label 
treatment (i.e. tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W plus optional use of TCS). In this open label arm, the 
percentage of responders increased overtime. 
Time to event analysis in open label treatment period, did not illustrate a plateau pattern in cumulative 
probability of response for neither monotherapy nor combination therapy trials. This indicated that 
some patients may still benefit from treatment after 52/32 weeks. Optimal time point for therapy 
discontinuation in non-responders is inconclusive, provided the results of time to event analysis. 
Therefore, consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no 
response after 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently 
improve further with continued treatment every other week beyond 16 weeks. This statement has 
been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A significant better efficacy compared to placebo was demonstrated for tralokinumab as monotherapy 
or in combination with TCS in AD patients who are insufficiently controlled with topical therapies alone. 
Therefore, the CHMP endorsed the proposed dose of 300 mg every other week (Q2W) with a loading 
dose of 600 mg on day 1 and the dose of 300 mg every fourth week (Q4W) for patients who achieve 
clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks of treatment. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of tralokinumab was evaluated in a pool of 5 completed randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies in patients with moderate-to-severe AD including the three phase 3 studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 125/126 
 
 
 
(ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3), the dose-ranging study (D2213C00001) and the vaccine-
response study (ECZTRA 5).  
Safety data were also submitted from 4 ongoing supportive studies with tralokinumab including the 
phase 3 long-term safety and efficacy study in adult subjects previously participating in the ECZTRA 
trials (ECZTEND), the drug-drug interaction study (ECZTRA 4) and 2 additional phase 3 study (ECZTRA 
7, ECTRA 6). Data from 17 clinical trials in asthma, ulcerative colitis (UC), and idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) is also available as supporting data only.  
For the integrated safety analysis, four data pools were assembled: AD pool (ECZTRA1, ECZTRA2, 
ECZTRA3, ECZTRA5 and D2213C00001), asthma pool (STRATOS 1 and 2, CD-RI-CAT- 354-1049), 
exposure pool (all completed trials with tralokinumab across all indications) (Figure 26).

Exposure pool 
In all completed trials with tralokinumab across all indications (healthy subjects, AD, asthma, UC, and 
IPF), 4281 subjects received at least one dose of tralokinumab (3054 Patient-Years of Exposure (PYE)) 
and 2026 subjects received the placebo (1307 PYE).  
Patient exposure in AD pool  
In the 5 completed AD studies, 1991 subjects were exposed to tralokinumab with a total exposure of 
1404 PYE. The exposure to tralokinumab gradually declined over time with the completion of the trials: 
dose-finding trial (Week 12), ECZTRA 5 (Week 16) and ECZTRA 3 (Week 32), and the re-
randomisation of a third of the tralokinumab Week-16 responders to placebo at Week 16 in ECZTRA 1 
and 2 (Table 38).  
The majority of subjects in the tralokinumab treatment groups were exposed to tralokinumab for ≥16 
weeks (AD pool: 90.1%; monotherapy pool: 92.7%; ECZTRA 3 trial: 91.7%).  
In total, 807 subjects (821 PYE) were exposed to tralokinumab for ≥52 weeks compared with 31 
subjects (31 PYE) exposed to placebo for ≥52 weeks. These subjects were all from the monotherapy 
pool (ECZTRA 1 and 2).

In the monotherapy pool (ECZTRA 1 and 2), the exposure to tralokinumab (Q2W and Q4W) during 
the maintenance treatment period was approximately half that of the tralokinumab exposure during 
the initial treatment period (172 vs 354 PYE). In contrast, tralokinumab exposure during the open-
label period (tralokinumab Q2W with optional use of TCS) was almost twice that obtained during the 
initial period (665 vs 354 PYE). 
The total exposure during the maintenance period was higher in subjects re-randomised to 
tralokinumab Q2W (85 PYE) and Q4W (88 PYE) than in subjects re-randomised to placebo (38 PYE) 
and higher than in Week 16 placebo responders maintained on placebo (29 PYE). Approximately half of 
the subjects entering the maintenance period completed the maintenance period.  
In total, 1121 subjects were allocated to the open-label treatment group (tralokinumab Q2W with 
optional use of TCS) corresponding to a total exposure of 665 PYE and a mean and median exposure of 
31 and 36 Patient-Weeks of Exposure (PWE) (Table 39). 
Table 39 Summary of exposure time - monotherapy pool - entire treatment period - safety analysis set 
In the combination therapy (ECZTRA 3), 243 subjects were exposed to tralokinumab + TCS and 
123 subjects were exposed to placebo + TCS. 226 subjects (92.6%) and 117 (94.4%) completed week 
16. N=160 patients (48.3%) were exposed to tralokinumab Q2W +TCS for >30 weeks. 
At data lock point 1 (27-Jun-2019), all subjects had completed the treatment periods (Week 32). At 
this date, 43 subjects were still in the safety follow-up period. 
In the phase 2b dose finding study (D2213C00001), 204 subjects were randomised. Tralokinumab 
was administered as 2 SC injections of 1 mL each, Q2W for 12 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Safety and 
tolerability were assessed as secondary endpoints. A total of 25 Japanese subjects were randomised.  
Patient exposure in asthma pool (supporting data) 
In the 3 asthma studies, 1528 subjects received tralokinumab (all dosing frequencies), 973 subjects 
received placebo. Subjects were treated every 2 weeks (tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W or placebo), and 
Assessment report

the total exposure time for subjects exposed to tralokinumab was 1395.2 PYE. A total of 84.4% of the 
subjects treated with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W received IMP for at least 52 weeks. 
The applicant has provided data from the asthma pool in support of the long-term safety of 
tralokinumab in the AD indication. This data is considered as supporting data only and limitations in 
extrapolating fully to the AD population are acknowledged. In terms of exposure to tralokinumab in the 
asthma pool, the table below highlights that limited numbers of patients were treated with 
tralokinumab in the longer term up to 52 weeks (between 42-51 weeks: n=38). 
Table 40 Exposure time – tralokinumab total and placebo total – asthma pool – safety analysis set 
Ongoing trials 
In the ongoing AD extension trial (ECZTEND), 1245 subjects have been exposed to tralokinumab. 
Of the subjects in ECZTEND who came from completed AD trials (ECZTRA 1, 2, 3, and 5) 659 subjects 
from the ECZTRA 1 and 2 trials, and 260 subjects from ECZTRA 3 trial 630 subjects have been exposed 
to tralokinumab for a total of ≥18 months and 147 subjects have been exposed to tralokinumab for a 
total of ≥24 months. 
Long-term exposure to tralokinumab (≥12 months) is presented in Table 41. It corresponds to the 
cumulative exposure to tralokinumab for subjects who started tralokinumab exposure during ECZTRA 
1, 2, 3, or 5 combined with their exposure in ECZTEND.

Adverse events 
Initial treatment period 
In the initial treatment period of the AD pool, about 66% of patients experienced one or more 
treatment emergent AEs, in the tralokinumab group as well as in the placebo group (Table 42). Most 
AEs were mild or moderate, severe AEs occurred in 5% of the tralokinumab group and 6% of the 
placebo group.

Figure 27 Dot plot of most frequent AEs in any treatment group by Preferred Term, in the initial 
treatment period of the AD pool 
In the initial treatment periods of the monotherapy pool and of the combination therapy trial, the 
pattern and occurrence of AEs was similar as in the AD pool. Of the less frequently occurring AEs in the 
combination therapy trial, AEs that occurred more frequently in the tralokinumab + TCS group as 
compared to the placebo + TCS group were: diarrhoea (3.2% versus 1.6%), sinusitis (2.8% versus 
0.8%).  
Maintenance treatment 
In the maintenance period of the 16-week responders in the monotherapy pool, the proportion of 
patients with at least one AE was highest in the Q2W group, followed by the placebo group and the 
Q4W group (Table 43).

Table 43 Summary of Adverse Events in the maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy pool 
Common AEs that occurred more frequent in tralokinumab treated groups (Q2W and Q4W versus 
placebo) were: viral upper respiratory tract infection (15% and 15% versus 14%) and upper 
respiratory tract infection (9.4% and 6.7% versus 4.9%) and bronchitis (2.5% and 6.1% versus 
2.5%), influenza (3.8% and 2.4% versus 2.5%), injection site reactions (5.7% and 6.7% versus 
1.2%) and injection site erythema (3.8% and 3.0% versus 0%), conjunctivitis (5.0% and 3.0% versus 
2.5%), headache (5.0% and 2.4% versus 3.7%) and back pain (3.8% and 3.6% versus 0%). The 
higher occurrence of viral upper respiratory tract infections in tralokinumab treated groups was 
numerically small. The occurrence of allergic conjunctivitis, asthma and pruritis was similar or lower in 
the tralokinumab treated groups as compared to the placebo group (Figure 28).

Figure 28 Dot plot of most frequent AEs in any treatment group by Preferred Term, in the maintenance 
treatment period of the monotherapy pool 
Comparing tralokinumab Q2W, tralokinumab Q4W, and the group of subjects re-randomised to 
placebo, there was a tendency towards a dose-response relationship (Q2W > Q4W > placebo) for 
conjunctivitis, injection site erythema, and upper respiratory tract infection (but not viral upper 
respiratory tract infection). 
The occurrence and pattern of AEs in responders continuing Q2W in the maintenance period  
(Figure 28) was similar or lower as compared to the initial treatment period (Figure 27). 
Asthma pool – supporting data 
In the asthma pool, the overall adjusted incidence and rate of AEs during treatment were higher for 
tralokinumab total vs placebo total (73.2 vs 67.7%; 405.4 vs 383.5 events per 100 PYE).  
Common AEs that occurred with a higher frequency in the tralokinumab groups as compared to the 
placebo group were: bronchitis (7.8% versus 6.7%) and urinary tract infection (4.7% versus 3.8%) 
and influenza (3.7% versus 2.9%); headache (8.5% versus 6.6%) and arthralgia (3.6% versus 2.6%); 
injection site erythema (4.5% versus 0.1%) and injection site reaction (4.0% versus 0.3%); 
hypertension (3.7% versus 2.7%). 
Among the AEs that occurred in a similar frequency were: viral upper respiratory tract infection and 
upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, and injection site pain. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Based on results in the AD pool, monotherapy pool and ECZTRA 3 trial alone, the overall frequency of 
SAEs up to 16 weeks of treatment was lower for tralokinumab vs placebo (2.1% vs 2.8%) (with or 
without TCS). The frequency of SAEs was low in all trials in AD, with only minor between-trial 
variations.  
For the majority of SAEs, the outcome was recovered/resolved for both tralokinumab and placebo. 
SAEs were most frequently reported within the SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ occurring 
at similar adjusted incidence and rate for tralokinumab and placebo.  
Most SAEs for tralokinumab were events of ‘dermatitis atopic’ reported within the first 2 months of 
treatment (5 events in 5 subjects [0.3%] vs 1 event [0.2%] for placebo).  
Two SAEs of ‘dermatitis exfoliative generalised’ occurred in 2 subjects (0.1%) in the tralokinumab 
group, while 1 event occurred in the placebo group (0.2%).  
Deaths 
22 deaths occurred in tralokinumab trials in other indications than AD: 12 deaths in asthma [6 for 
tralokinumab (0.3%; 0.3 deaths per 100 PY) and 6 for placebo (0.5%; 0.4 deaths per 100 PY)] and 10 
deaths in IPF [8 for tralokinumab (6.1%; 5.5 deaths per 100 PY) and 2 for placebo (3.3%; 2.9 deaths 
per 100 PY)]. 
2 deaths occurred during the AD trials and an additional 3 deaths occurred after trial. The death causes 
of the 5 subjects with AD who died during or after the trials were described as: unknown/ ‘might be 
cardiac’; septic shock and respiratory failure; pneumonia and septic shock; myocardial infarction; 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 133/134 
 
 
 
A 57-year-old male died during the dose-finding trial which was identified as possible ‘cardiac event’. 
In ECZTRA 5 a 50-year-old female experienced a multitude of AEs and SAEs before eventually dying 
during the follow-up period of ‘failure to thrive’, ‘encephalopathy’, ‘acute hepatic failure’, ‘respiratory 
failure’, ‘septic shock’ and ‘pneumonia’.  
In addition, 3 deaths occurred after lock of the clinical database and are therefore only included in the 
safety database (a 62-year-old male subject ‘myocardial infarction’, 51-year-old male - ‘pneumonia’, a 
24-year-old female - ‘metastatic squamous cell carcinoma’). 
Other significant events 
In the initial treatment period of the AD pool, the adjusted incidence and rate of any severe infection 
and any serious infection were lower for tralokinumab than for placebo. There were 10 subjects (0.6%, 
2.1 events per 100 PYE ) and 9 subjects (1.4%, 5.8 events per 100 PYE) severe infections, and 6 
subjects (0.4%, 1.3 events per 100 PYE) and 7 subjects (1.1%, 3.7 events per 100 PYE)) serious 
infections in the tralokinumab group versus the placebo group. Similarly, infections requiring medical 
treatment were less frequent in the tralokinumab group. Opportunistic infections were reported in 56 
subjects (3.4 %, 13.0 events per 100 PYE) in the tralokinumab group and in 32 subjects (4.9 %, 21.3 
events per 100 PYE) in the placebo group. Endoparasitosis or tuberculous infection did not occur. 
In the initial treatment period of the AD pool, the adjusted incidence and rate of eye disorders 
(adverse event of special interest [AESI]) were higher in the tralokinumab group than in the 
placebo group with 7.9% versus 3.4% and 31.1 events per 100 PYE versus 12.9 events per 100 PYE. 
Conjunctivitis (AESI) occurred more frequently in AD patients who received tralokinumab (7.5%, 
29.0 event per 100 PYE) compared to placebo (3.2%, 12.3 event per 100 PYE) in the initial treatment 
period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies. Conjunctivitis (as preferred term [PT]) was reported 
at a higher frequency in patients with severe atopic dermatitis compared to subjects with moderate AD 
in both the tralokinumab group (6.0 vs 3.3%; initial treatment period) and placebo group (2.2 vs 
0.8%; initial treatment period). Most patients recovered or were recovering during the treatment 
period. Keratitis (as PT) was reported in 0.5% of subjects treated with tralokinumab during the initial 
treatment period. Of these, half were classified as keratoconjunctivitis, all were non-serious and mild 
or moderate in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation. 
In the quartile analysis of the ER relationship assessing incidence of conjunctivitis versus exposure in 
the phase 3 trials, a higher incidence of conjunctivitis was observed in each exposure quartile of 
subjects receiving tralokinumab than in subjects receiving placebo. However, no relationship between 
exposure and the incidence of conjunctivitis was observed across quartiles of exposure. 
Skin infections requiring systemic treatment (AESI) (2.6% versus 5.5%) and eczema herpeticum 
(AESI) (0.3% versus 1.5%) occurred less in tralokinumab as compared to placebo in the initial 
treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies in AD. Across all treatment periods in the 
pool of 5 studies, all eczema herpeticum events reported in the tralokinumab group were non-serious, 
none were severe, and a single event led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
In the initial treatment period of the AD pool, on tralokinumab there were more patients with clinically 
relevant increases in the number of eosinophils as compared to the placebo group (23.5% versus 
9.7%). This difference is also visible in the shift table from baseline to the highest post-baseline value. 
Most subjects were recovered or were recovering during the trial (see also ‘laboratory findings’ 
section). 
In the entire treatment period of the AD pool, no events of anaphylaxis (reported within 2 days after 
IMP administration) occurred. In the Asthma pool, there were some occurrences of anaphylaxis 
(reported within 2 days after IMP administration): 6 events reported by 3 subjects in the tralokinumab

total group and 4 events reported by 2 subjects in the placebo total group. In the tralokinumab total 
group, the events were all non-serious and had mild or moderate intensity. with similar adjusted 
incidence and rate for tralokinumab and placebo (0.2% versus 0.2%; 0.38 events per 100 PYE versus 
0.44 events per 100 PYE). 
Injection site reactions (including pain and redness) occurred more frequently in patients who 
received tralokinumab (7.2%) compared to placebo (3.0%) in the initial treatment period of up to 
16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies. Across all treatment periods in the 5 studies in atopic dermatitis, the 
vast majority (99%) of injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity, and few patients 
(< 1%) discontinued tralokinumab treatment. Most injections site reactions reported had a short 
duration with approximately 76% of the events resolving within 1 to 5 days. 
In the AD pool, comprising 5 clinical trials in AD, a total of 31 malignancies (tralokinumab total: 24 
events; placebo total: 7 events) were captured by the SMQ (MedDRA) ‘Malignant or unspecified 
tumour’ (narrow scope) search over the entire trial period, including all treatment periods (placebo-
controlled and open-label) and the safety follow-up period. 
The proportion of subjects with events was 0.9% for tralokinumab (total n=1991) and 0.7% for 
placebo (total n=761). The event rate for tralokinumab was 1.4 per 100 PYO [95% CI: 0.9; 2.1] and 
for placebo 2.2 per 100 PYO [95% CI: 1.1; 4.6]. Hence, the rate ratio for tralokinumab vs placebo was 
0.6 [95% CI: 0.3;1.5]. 
The majority of the events in both treatment groups were reported within the HLT ‘Skin neoplasms 
malignant and unspecified (excl melanoma)’, tralokinumab: 19 of 24 events; placebo: 4 of 7 events; 
the PTs were ‘squamous cell carcinoma of the skin’, ‘basal cell carcinoma’, and ‘Bowen’s disease’. The 
remaining events were reported across different organ systems, with no apparent latency in relation to 
treatment with IMP and no clustering of events over time. 
Few of the events were serious or severe, with no notably differences between treatment groups. 
A total of 12 cardiovascular events (CV) of interest were identified in the AD pool (all doses) during 
the trial (tralokinumab total: 9 events; placebo total: 3 events). The applicant outlined that considering 
that the observation time was ~5.5 times higher for tralokinumab than placebo, the incidence and rate 
of CV events of interest were similar in the tralokinumab total group and the placebo total group (0.4 
vs 0.3%). The events had an onset throughout the entire trial durations with no apparent latency or 
clustering of events over time observed. One event of Ischaemic stroke occurred in the ECZTRA 3 trial. 
In ongoing trials ECZTRA 6 one of the SAEs (‘cerebrovascular accident’) in a subject led to permanent 
discontinuation of IMP. According to an external neurologist who evaluated the case, the stroke was 
unlikely to be attributable to the IMP, as the subject had several risk factors contributing to the event. 
‘Transient ischaemic attack’ was reported by 4 subjects (5 events) in the tralokinumab total group and 
with no reports in the placebo group. Three of these 4 subjects had a relevant medical history of 
transient ischaemic attack, angina pectoris and/or hypertension, and all 3 were also overweight or 
obese. In addition, 1 subject treated with tralokinumab in ECZTRA 1 died from a myocardial infarction 
approximately 8 months after the last dose of IMP. 
Two events related to suicidality were captured across the AD programme, 1 event of overdose and 1 
event of depression suicidal. Both events were SAEs and reported in the tralokinumab Q2W group in 
ECZTRA 2 in the initial treatment period. None of the events were considered related to tralokinumab, 
and for both events several external stressors were reported as alternative aetiologies.

Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant changes in red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells were observed, based on 
the evaluation of mean values, potentially clinically significant values, shifts from baseline, and AEs, 
with the exception of eosinophils. 
Eosinophil levels 
AEs of eosinophilia (PTs ‘eosinophil count increased’ and ‘eosinophilia’), were reported by a higher 
proportion of subjects with tralokinumab than with placebo in the AD pool initial period (Table 44), the 
monotherapy pool (initial, maintenance and open-label period) and ECZTRA 3 (initial and continuation 
period). There was no indication of increasing incidences or worsening of severity of AEs of eosinophilia 
in the maintenance or open-label treatment period of the monotherapy pool compared with that of the 
initial treatment period. The majority of the subjects reporting AEs of ‘eosinophil count increased’ and 
‘eosinophilia’ during the AD pool initial period and the monotherapy pool (initial, maintenance and 
open-label period) had elevated eosinophil levels at baseline (>0.5×109/L).

The majority of the events were mild or moderate in severity, and most subjects were 
recovered/resolved or recovering/resolving from the event in both treatment groups. 1 subject 
reported 2 severe events (PT ‘eosinophilia’) in the initial period of which 1 was also an SAE. 
Across the complete trials in AD (all trial periods), no events of serious eosinophilic conditions 
(including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) or drug reactions with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS) were reported in subjects treated with tralokinumab. 
Liver Function Tests 
No subjects in the AD pool reported ‘drug-induced liver injury’.  
Mean levels of ALP, ALT, AST, BILI, and GGT exhibited minor fluctuations, within the normal ranges, 
during the initial treatment period of the AD pool (ECZTRA trials only), the maintenance periods of the 
monotherapy pool and the initial period of the combination therapy trial (ECZTRA 3). 
Mean ALP levels increased with tralokinumab from baseline to Week 4 and then gradually declined over 
the course of the trial. Mean levels for placebo were stable, and tralokinumab and placebo mean ALP 
levels remained within the normal ranges throughout the trial period. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
A number of AEs were reported relating to changes in liver parameter measurements throughout the 
entire trial period of the AD pool (tralokinumab: 99; placebo: 23).  
The adjusted incidence and rate of AEs within the hepatobiliary disorders SOC was low and similar 
between tralokinumab and placebo during the initial trial period of the AD pool (0.2 vs 0.4%; 0.7 vs 
1.6 events per 100 PYE).  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 136/137 
 
 
 
   
An overall higher proportion and rate of hepatobiliary disorders was reported with tralokinumab than 
placebo when looking across the entire treatment period (1.0 vs 0.4%; 1.5 vs 0.9 events per 100 
PYO).  
Few hepatobiliary disorder terms were reported by more than 1 subject on tralokinumab or placebo. 
The most common PTs within this SOC were ‘hyperbilirubinaemia’ (0.3 vs 0.1%) and ‘hepatic steatosis’ 
(0.2 vs 0.1%). 
1 SAE of ‘acute hepatic failure’ was reported with tralokinumab in a subject who experienced a 
multitude of AEs and SAEs (see’ SAE/death section’).  
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs were measured in all trials in AD whereas routine ECG monitoring was only included in the 
phase 3 ECZTRA trials.  
Monoclonal antibodies, like tralokinumab, are not expected to interact directly with ion channels due to 
the large size and high specificity, thus a thorough QT/QTc trial was not planned. Instead, a blinded 
external expert conducted evaluations on the ECG data. 
No clinically relevant changes in vital signs (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, pulse 
rate) or ECG were observed, based on the evaluation of mean values, potentially clinically significant 
values, and AEs. 
No cardiac safety concerns were observed, based on the centralised ECG evaluation by external 
cardiovascular ECG experts. No formal QT/QTc study was undertaken during the tralokinumab AD 
clinical development, the analysis of routine ECGs recorded during the phase 3 ECZTRA trials did not 
indicate a specific safety concern. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in special groups and situations is primarily based on subgroup analysis of AE data. 
The AE evaluation related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors focused on incidence rather than event rate, 
due to the fact that the analysis was based on the 16-week initial treatment period for all subjects. 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
In the AD pool, 109 subjects (4.8%) were elderly (aged ≥65 years), of whom 77 were exposed to 
tralokinumab. Independent of treatment group, the overall incidence of AEs appeared to be lower in 
elderly subjects than in younger adult subjects. This difference was mainly driven by lower incidence in 
elderly subjects for ‘dermatitis atopic’ and ‘viral upper respiratory tract infection’. Except for these 2 
types of events, the AE profiles were overall similar between the elderly age group and the younger 
adult population. Thus, no dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. 
Renal and hepatic function 
For subgroups of renal function (normal function, mildly impaired, and moderately impaired) and for 
subgroups of hepatic function (normal function and mildly impaired), the incidences of AEs and SAEs 
were comparable or lower for tralokinumab Q2W vs placebo. Thus, no dose adjustment is 
recommended in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Body Weight 
The overall incidence of AEs was comparable between tralokinumab Q2W and placebo for body weight 
and BMI subgroups, with no clinically relevant differences in the AE profile.

Paediatric population 
Safety and efficacy are currently not established for use of tralokinumab in paediatric patients. Data in 
adolescents is being generated in the ongoing ECZTRA 6 trial. Adolescents are not included in the 
proposed indication. Additional clinical trials in children (from 6 months of age) are planned as per the 
paediatric programmes. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Tralokinumab has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women, and no information on the 
excretion of tralokinumab in human milk or effects on the nursing infant is available. The potential risk 
during pregnancy and lactation is therefore currently unknown (also see ‘Non-clinical’ section). 
In all trials in AD (complete and ongoing) a total of 30 pregnancies in female subjects treated with 
tralokinumab and 4 pregnancies in partners of male subjects who received tralokinumab were reported 
(paternal pregnancies were not collected systematically as per protocol in the ECZTRA trials) in the 
safety database up until 20-Jan-2021. A total of 8 maternal pregnancies were reported in the trials in 
asthma, of which 5 received tralokinumab (all gave birth to healthy babies). No pregnancies were 
reported in the trials with tralokinumab in IPF and UC. In all trials with tralokinumab to date, no 
adverse outcomes have been reported in the babies born by female subjects exposed to tralokinumab. 
2 spontaneous abortions in maternal pregnancy cases have been reported: 1 within first week of 
pregnancy and 1 at gestation-week 4. Of note, 2 maternal pregnancy cases are currently ongoing with 
final outcome unknown and 2 pregnant female subjects were lost to follow-up without reporting the 
final outcome to the investigator. 1 adverse outcome has been reported after a paternal pregnancy; 
the pregnancy outcome was reported as a live baby with congenital anomalies, both of mild severity. 
Both anomalies had resolved without treatment within 3 months.  
Immunological events 
Clinical data from the trials with tralokinumab in AD as well as supportive clinical data from other 
indications (asthma, UC, and IPF) showed that the rate of ADA was low. For the ECZTRA trials, a 
similar ADA incidence was observed in subjects treated with tralokinumab (1.4%) compared with 
subjects treated with placebo (1.3%) during the initial 16 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, 2/1553 
tralokinumab treated subjects (0.1%) and 1/629 placebo-treated subjects (0.2%) had treatment-
emergent NAb during the initial 16 weeks of treatment. Thus, the ADA/NAb incidence after 16 weeks of 
treatment was low and similar between tralokinumab and placebo confirming the low immunogenicity 
of tralokinumab. The ADA incidence for subjects who received tralokinumab up to 52 weeks was 4.6%; 
0.9% had persistent ADA and 1.0% had neutralising antibodies. 
No distinct pattern of AEs was found in the ADA/NAb positive subjects. No immunogenicity related 
adverse events such as immune complex disease, serum sickness/serum sickness-like reactions, or 
anaphylaxis were observed with tralokinumab in the AD pool (across all trial periods) and there was no 
increased risk of serious allergic reactions in the ADA ECZTRA analysis set. Furthermore, there was no 
indication of an impact of ADA/NAb on PK or efficacy. 
See also PK section ‘Integrated analysis of immunogenicity’. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific non-clinical drug interaction studies were conducted as no drug-drug interactions were 
expected based on the putative mechanism of tralokinumab. There currently are no clinical data on 
drug interactions with tralokinumab. A drug-drug interaction (DDI) trial (ECZTRA 4) is ongoing to 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021

determine the DDI potential between tralokinumab and CYP substrates in subjects with AD. With 
respect to drugs likely to be co-administered with tralokinumab in clinical use, it is expected that 
combination therapy with TCS will occur in clinical practice. Tralokinumab in combination with TCS was 
investigated in ECZTRA 3.  
See also PK/PD section. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most frequent AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP were ‘dermatitis atopic’ at lower 
adjusted incidence and rate for tralokinumab vs placebo. The majority of these events had onset within 
the first 1-2 months of treatment both for tralokinumab (7 events in 7 subjects; onset on Days 12, 14, 
15, 23, 38, 60, and 99) and for placebo (10 events in 10 subjects; onset on Days 2, 4, 9, 14, 15, 31, 
47, 57, 64, and 69). The AE ‘injection site reaction’ occurred only in the tralokinumab group with onset 
within the first 1-3 months (Days 36, 58, 70, 70, and 74). ‘Eosinophilia’ also only occurred in the 
tralokinumab group, had onset on Days 22, 43, and 58 (all 3 subjects had elevated eosinophil levels at 
baseline [range: 0.8-3.3×109/L]). The AE ‘conjunctivitis’ also only occurred in the tralokinumab group 
onset on Days 16 and 19. All other AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP were single events 
for each PT within each treatment group. 
In the AD Pool AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP occurred at similar incidence and rate 
for tralokinumab and placebo (2.3 and 2.8%) in the initial treatment period. An overview of the 
available data relating to discontinuation with longer term use of tralokinumab in AD patients (i.e. 
beyond 16 weeks treatment) was not provided. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In total, 1991 subjects with AD were exposed to tralokinumab in the 5 completed studies (ECZTRA 1, 
2, 3, 5, and dose finding study D2213C00001). In this AD pool, 90.1% of subjects (N=1794) in the 
tralokinumab treatment groups were exposed to tralokinumab for ≥16 weeks and 40.5% of subjects 
(N=807) were exposed to tralokinumab for ≥52 weeks. The exposure to tralokinumab gradually 
declined over time with the completion of the trials. Much of the safety information up to week 52 is 
acquired from the majority of patients who were non-responders at Week 16 and thus continued 
tralokinumab Q2W in the open-label fashion. The relatively high percentage of patients who did not 
complete treatment in the tralokinumab maintenance period was explained by the trial design, 
whereby approximately 30% of patients treated with tralokinumab ended up transferring to the open-
label treatment group (where additional treatment with TCS could be used). Approximately 80% of 
patients in the open-label study went on to complete treatment.  
As mentioned in the clinical efficacy discussion, two sites were prematurely terminated due to GCP 
compliance issues. From a safety perspective there was uncertainty in relation to the data for the site 
based in the US; initially, no AEs were reported until questioned by the applicant. The AEs that 
eventually were reported from the site had a different AE pattern from those observed at other sites. A 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding the 12 subjects from the statistical analysis concludes no impact 
on trial conclusion on the confirmatory primary and key secondary endpoints at Week 16.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 139/140 
 
 
 
The size of the safety database and degree of patient exposure for tralokinumab to support this 
application is overall considered sufficient. The numbers of patients with long term exposure to 
tralokinumab are somewhat low. Further safety information will be collected in the ongoing long-term 
safety study (ECZTEND) listed as category 3 in the RMP. The interim and final study reports will be 
submitted for assessment by Q4 2022 and Q1 2025, respectively.  
Adverse events, severe adverse events and death 
During the initial treatment period in the AD pool, the proportion of patients who experienced one or 
more treatment emergent AE during the 16-week treatment period was similar between the patients 
treated with tralokinumab and placebo (around 66%). Most AEs were mild or moderate, severe AEs 
occurred in 5% of the tralokinumab group and 6% of the placebo group. The proportion of patients 
who discontinued treatment due to AEs was low (2.3% in the tralokinumab group and 2.8% in the 
placebo group). 
A similar trend in terms of frequency and severity of AEs was observed in the safety follow-up. The 
overall incidence and rate of AEs were low and generally similar for tralokinumab and placebo (14.2 vs 
12.8%), with the majority of AEs recorded as being mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation of 
tralokinumab due to AEs during both the maintenance and open-label treatment was comparatively low 
1.5% and 3.1%.  
Overall, the most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients treated with tralokinumab 
with or without TCS were upper respiratory tract infections (23.4%; mainly reported as common cold), 
ISR (7.2%), conjunctivitis (5.4%) and conjunctivitis allergic (2.0%).  
The frequency of SAEs was low in all trials in AD and for the majority the outcome was 
recovered/resolved for both tralokinumab and placebo. Most SAEs in patients treated with 
tralokinumab were events of ‘dermatitis atopic’ reported within the first 2 months of treatment (5 
events in 5 subjects [0.3%] vs 1 event [0.2%] for placebo) which was an expected AE in the treated 
population. This was also the most frequent AE- leading to permanent discontinuation of the IMP. 
On the basis of the available data, there is no evidence that treatment with tralokinumab in AD is 
associated with an increased risk of death compared with placebo.  
Results on common AEs, AE severity, and investigator causality in the supporting data arising from the 
asthma pool during 52 weeks of treatment with tralokinumab vs placebo were generally in accordance 
with the results in AD, taking into consideration the differences in aetiology and disease characteristics 
between the AD and asthma trial populations. The higher frequencies of ‘viral upper respiratory tract 
infection’, ‘upper respiratory tract infection’, and ‘conjunctivitis’ for tralokinumab vs placebo seen in AD 
were, however, not observed in the asthma pool. Conjunctivitis rate difference raises the question of 
ocular or immune difference between AD and Asthma. Whilst the asthma pool is considered as 
supportive data, it is noted that differences in trial populations occur between both subgroups AD 
versus asthma patients.  
Safety areas of interest 
Infections and infestations occurred at similar adjusted incidence and rate for tralokinumab and 
placebo and any serious infection were lower for tralokinumab than for placebo. 
The incidence of ‘viral upper respiratory tract infection’ during the initial treatment period in the AD 
pool was higher for tralokinumab (15.7%) than for placebo (12.2%). ‘Upper respiratory tract 
infections’ has been listed as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency very common. 
Skin infections requiring systemic treatment (2.5% versus 5.5%) and eczema herpeticum (0.3% 
versus 1.5%) occurred less in tralokinumab as compared to placebo in the initial treatment period of 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 140/141 
 
 
 
up to 16 weeks. Eczema herpeticum has been described as a selected adverse reaction in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
Across the clinical trials in AD, the frequency of opportunistic infections was lower with tralokinumab 
treatment compared with placebo. However, some imbalances were observed between the clinical 
studies in the AD population. 
In the continuation treatment period (ECZTRA 3), the rate of opportunistic infections for tralokinumab 
+ TCS total was notably higher than the rate observed for tralokinumab Q2W + TCS in the initial 
treatment period (28.4 vs 17.3 events per 100 PYE). This increase was not seen during the 
maintenance treatment period and the open-label arm in the monotherapy pool. 
In the AD safety follow up period, the rate of serious infections in the tralokinumab group was slightly 
higher during follow-up than during treatment (2.4 events per 100 PYFU vs 1.3 events per 100 PYE) 
but lower than in the placebo group during treatment (3.7 events per 100 PYE). 
Similarly, the rates of severe infection requiring antibiotic treatment with tralokinumab Q2W in the 
maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy pool (4.7 events per 100 PYE) and the open-label 
arm (5.1 events per 100 PYE) were comparable with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period 
3.4 events per 100 PYE) with a trend towards a numerically higher frequency of these cases over 
longer term treatment with tralokinumab. It is therefore recommended that this topic continues to be 
closely monitored as further longer-term data becomes available from routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
Eye disorders occurred more frequently in the tralokinumab group (7.9%) than placebo (3.4%) in the 
initial treatment period of the AD pool. None of the eye disorder were serious and the majority of the 
events were mild or moderate in severity and responded to treatment with topical preparations. 
Epidemiological data have shown that patients with AD have an increased risk of ocular comorbidities, 
such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, and keratoconus compared with the general population, and the 
incidence of ocular complications increases with AD severity. The mechanisms underlying this 
observation are however unclear. 
Furthermore, conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic were more frequently reported for tralokinumab 
vs placebo during the initial treatment period in the AD pool (‘conjunctivitis’: 5.4 vs 1.9%; 
‘conjunctivitis allergic’: 2.0 vs 1.1%). Subjects with conjunctivitis appeared to have more severe AD at 
baseline than subjects without conjunctivitis. More than half of the subjects reporting conjunctivitis in 
the initial treatment period had a history of allergic conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis. Most patients 
recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. A large variation in the duration of the 
conjunctivitis events was observed in both treatment groups approximately 25% had a duration of 91 
days or longer. 
Keratitis was reported in 0.5% of subjects treated with tralokinumab during the initial treatment 
period. Of these, half were classified as keratoconjunctivitis, all were non-serious and mild or moderate 
in severity, and none led to treatment discontinuation. 
The event rates for ‘conjunctivitis’, ‘conjunctivitis allergic’, and ‘keratitis’ were lower during the 
continued treatment (16 – 32 weeks) with tralokinumab compared to the initial treatment period. 
However, among the Week 16 tralokinumab responders, pre-defined eye disorder was reported with a 
higher incidence and rate in the tralokinumab Q2W + TCS group than in the tralokinumab Q4W + TCS 
group (4.3 vs 1.4%).  
Overall, the rate of conjunctivitis with tralokinumab Q2W in the maintenance treatment period of the 
monotherapy pool was lower than the rate observed in the initial treatment period with a tendency 
towards a dose-response in the rate of conjunctivitis reported for tralokinumab Q2W vs Q4W. The 
Assessment report

Page 141/142 
 
 
 
pattern of conjunctivitis events as well as the types of events reported also appeared similar to what 
was observed in the initial period.  
Conjunctivitis has been listed as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency common and a 
statement about conjunctivitis and keratitis has also been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Patients 
treated with tralokinumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following standard 
treatment should undergo ophthalmological examination. This ADR will also be monitored and assessed 
in the ongoing long-term PASS (ECZTEND). Conjunctivitis is also listed as an important potential risk in 
the RMP. 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported more frequently for patients treated with tralokinumab 
(7.2%) than for placebo (3.0%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the AD pool. A dose 
dependent effect was also seen, with higher rates of ISRs in the tralokinumab Q2W vs Q4W treated 
patients. The vast majority (99%) of ISRs were mild or moderate in severity, and few patients (< 1%) 
discontinued tralokinumab treatment. Most injections site reactions reported had a short duration with 
approximately 76% of the events resolving within 1 to 5 days. 
ISR has been listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency common and is further described in 
the list of selected adverse reactions. In addition, all events related to ISRs, reported from ongoing 
and future clinical trials and future post-marketing use, will be monitored via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
Eosinophilia was reported at a higher rate in patients treated with tralokinumab (1.3%) compared to 
placebo (0.3%) during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the AD pool. However, the 
incidence was overall low. Tralokinumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from 
baseline in eosinophil count compared to patients treated with placebo. However, the increase in the 
tralokinumab-treated patients was transient, and mean eosinophil counts returned to baseline during 
continued treatment. The safety profile for subjects with eosinophilia was comparable to the safety 
profile for all subjects. Eosinophilia has been listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency 
common and is further described in the list of selected adverse reactions. 
Immunogenicity with tralokinumab was observed in the studies however the incidence was considered 
low. Across all trial periods, the ADA incidence for subjects who received tralokinumab was 4.6%; 
0.9% had persistent ADA and 1.0% had NAb. ADA and NAb responses were not associated with any 
impact on safety. AEs related to immunogenicity will be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance 
activities. Immunogenicity has also been described in the list of selected adverse reactions in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
Malignancies were recorded in 31 patients in the AD pool including in all treatment periods 
(tralokinumab total: 24 events; placebo total: 7 events). The use of immunosuppressant medications 
has been hypothesised as a potential risk for the development of malignancies. Some uncertainty 
remains in relation to the potential role of IL-13 in contributing to the development of malignancy and 
there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding its tumorigenic potential.  
Based on the available data, there is no specific safety signal in relation to the occurrence of 
malignancy with the use of tralokinumab. Nevertheless, the risk of developing malignancy following 
treatment with tralokinumab in AD patients cannot be completed excluded and long-term data should 
be provided to adequately characterise this risk through routine pharmacovigilance activities, PSURs 
and the ongoing long-term ongoing PASS (ECZTEND). Malignancy has also been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP.  
Headache and migraine occurred more frequently in tralokinumab treated patients as compared to 
placebo (headache: 8.5% tralokinumab versus 6.3% placebo; migraine: 0.5% tralokinumab vs 0.2% 
placebo). Following further clarification from the applicant on this issue, it is not recommended at this 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 142/143 
 
 
 
time to include these events in the SmPC but they should be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
Cardiovascular events were included as a safety area of interest. A total of 12 CV events of interest 
were identified in the AD pool (all doses) during the trial (tralokinumab total: 9 events; placebo total: 
3 events). The Applicant’s external CV expert outlined that the review of relevant serious CV cases 
concluded that there was no causal relationship between tralokinumab in 7 out of the 9 SAEs reported. 
1 SAE could theoretically be related to the IMP and 1 SAE was most likely not related to the IMP, but a 
final conclusion for these 2 SAEs could not be made from the available information. Although 
confounding factors were noted in many CVS cases reported with tralokinumab in the exposure pool, 
the potential for an association between the cases of CVA/TIA/CV events and thrombosis and possible 
coagulopathy relating to active treatment with tralokinumab should be monitored. This topic is 
currently considered as a topic of interest and should continue to be followed in the longer term 
through the ongoing PASS (ECZTEND).  
Suicidality: AD is associated with numerous psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and 
anxiety. There is no specific signal of increased risk of suicide by blocking IL-13 but since a diagnosis 
of AD is associated with a higher risk of depression and suicide, subjects who had a history of 
attempted suicide or were considered at significant risk of suicide attempt were excluded from the 
trial. Two events related to suicidality were reported in the tralokinumab Q2W group in ECZTRA 2 in 
the initial treatment period. None of the events were considered related to tralokinumab. This topic 
should continue to be routinely monitored and presented for discussion in PSURs as a topic of interest. 
Allergy, hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis: No cases of anaphylaxis, immune complex disease, serum 
sickness, or serum sickness like reactions arising from the use of tralokinumab occurred in the trials in 
AD. The frequency of serious allergic reactions was low and similar with tralokinumab and placebo. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
There is limited amount of data from the use of tralokinumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of tralokinumab during pregnancy (section 4.6 of SmPC). Use 
in pregnant and lactating women has been added as a missing information in the list of safety concerns 
in the RMP. The safety of tralokinumab use in pregnant women will be monitored in an observational 
PASS listed as category 3 in the RMP. Annual updates followed by interim and final study report will be 
submitted for review by Q4 2024 and Q2 2030, respectively. 
Dose-effect relationship 
A dose response effect was observed with more frequent dosing. This was driven by increases in upper 
respiratory tract infections and injection site related PTs with the more frequent tralokinumab Q2W 
dosing regimen vs the Q4W dosing regimen. There was also a consistent increase across trials in the 
incidence of eye disorders, primarily classified as ‘conjunctivitis’, with the more frequent dosing 
regimen Q2W vs the Q4W dosing regimen. ADAs were noted to be higher with tralokinumab 300mg 
Q4W in the maintenance period.  
In the maintenance treatment phase, the occurrence and pattern of common AEs in patients treated 
with tralokinumab Q2W was basically similar to Q2W in the initial treatment period, while AEs were 
less frequent in patients treated Q4W.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of tralokinumab has been well characterised in the conducted clinical trials and is

considered acceptable by CHMP. Some safety follow-ups are however requested as mentioned in the 
safety discussion. Further long-term safety data will also be provided and assessed from the ongoing

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that tralokinumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tralokinumab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tralokinumab is intended for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients who are 
candidate for systemic therapy. 
AD is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease. It is characterised by eczematous 
lesions (including erythema, excoriations, lichenification, infiltration, oozing), xerosis and pruritus. 
These clinical manifestations lead to significant sleep disturbances, severe psychological and 
sociological sequelae and impaired quality of life especially in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
The main goals of the treatment are the reduction of inflammation and symptoms, especially of 
pruritus. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with mild disease are generally managed with emollients and mild- to moderate-potency TCS.  
TCI are considered as an alternative or adjunct treatment to TCS, especially when treatment with TCS 
is either inadvisable or not possible and when steroid-sparing treatment is needed in sensitive areas, 
such as face and skin folds. However, patients with moderate-to-severe AD require additional therapies 
to control skin inflammation and symptoms. These additional therapies include phototherapy, high-
potency TCS and, eventually, when topical options fail to control the disease, systemic treatments.  
Currently, 2 systemic therapies are centrally approved for patients with AD: dupilumab (Dupixent), an 
injectable monoclonal antibody against IL4/IL13 approved in 2017 for moderate-to-severe AD in adults 
and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy; baricitinib (Olumiant), a 
JAK-inhibitor approved in July 2020 for moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients who are candidates for 
systemic therapy. In addition, two topical treatments (ointments) are approved in AD in the EU: 
crisaborole (Staquis) a PDE-4 inhibitor and tracrolimus monohydrate (Protopic) a calcineurin inhibitor. 
Other therapies are not centrally authorised but are approved in individual member states and 
recommended by AD treatment guidelines: Oral glucocorticosteroids are intended for severe AD; PUVA 
is intended for severe AD.  
In addition to approved therapies, current AD guidelines and expert advice recommend off-label use of 
other oral therapies, such as, e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil.  
For patients with moderate to severe AD for whom treatment with TCS and or TCIs and/or systemic 
therapies is insufficient, treatment options are limited, and therefore there is a need for new treatment 
options.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development programme supporting tralokinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe 
AD in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy, with or without TCS, is primarily based on 3 
adequate and well-controlled pivotal trials: 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 150/151 
 
 
 
• 
Two almost identical tralokinumab phase 3 monotherapy trials (ECZTRA 1 and 2) of 52-week 
duration where superiority to placebo at Week 16 was tested; 
•  One phase 3 combination therapy trial (ECZTRA 3) of 32-week duration where superiority of 
tralokinumab+TCS versus placebo+TCS at Week 16 was tested. 
Additionally, the following trials in AD support the efficacy in adults: 
•  One phase 2 vaccine response trial (ECZTRA 5) evaluating the effect of tralokinumab versus 
placebo on vaccine antibody responses. 
One phase 2b dose-finding trial evaluating the efficacy of 45 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg tralokinumab in 
combination with TCS versus placebo+TCS (dose-finding trial; D2213C00001). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the monotherapy (ECZTRA 1 and 2) and combination with TCSs (ECZTRA 3) studies, a significant 
greater proportion of patients treated with tralokinumab achieved the primary endpoints IGA 0 or 1 
and EASI-75 compared to placebo at Week 16.  
The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 was 15.8% (ECZTRA 1), 22.2% (ECZTRA 2), 
38.9% (ECZTRA 3) in the tralokinumab Q2W groups as compared to 7.1% (ECZTRA 1), 10.9% 
(ECZTRA 2), 26.2% (ECZTRA 3) in the placebo groups.  
The proportion of patients with EASI-75 at Week 16 was 25.0 % (ECZTRA 1), 33.2 % (ECZTRA 2), 
56.0% (ECZTRA 3) in the tralokinumab Q2W groups as compared to 12.7% (ECZTRA 1), 11.4% 
(ECZTRA 2), 35.7% (ECZTRA 3) in the placebo groups.  
The key secondary endpoints results for the initial treatment period (change in, reduction of Worst 
Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 and change in DLQI score from baseline to Week 16) 
supported the effects seen in the primary endpoints as statistically significantly better results were 
reported in patients receiving tralokinumab as compared to patients on placebo. For the vast majority 
of these endpoints consistent results were reported for the primary, secondary and tertiary estimands 
and all sensitivity analyses. 
Response rates (IGA 0/1 or EASI-75) at Week 52 in the monotherapy pool were 56.2% and 50% for 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W among subjects achieving clinical response 
at week 16, respectively. High maintenance of clinical efficacy at Week 32 were seen in the 
combination therapy study across tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS and tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q4W + TCS among subjects achieving clinical response at week 16. 
In both monotherapy studies (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) and in the concomitant TCS study (ECZTRA 3) 
tralokinumab improved patient-reported symptoms of AD, as measured by POEM, and the impact of 
AD on sleep, as measured by Eczema-related sleep NRS, at week 16 compared to placebo. A higher 
proportion of patients treated with tralokinumab had clinically meaningful reductions in POEM, (defined 
as at least 4 point improvement) from baseline to Week 16 compared to placebo. These endpoints 
were not included in the confirmatory testing strategy. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Albeit statistically significant, the effect size in the monotherapy trials was considered small. The 
clinical relevance and clinical significance of the treatment effect of tralokinumab both as monotherapy 
and in combination with TCS was therefore questioned during the evaluation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 151/152 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 in the monotherapy pool, did not identify any baseline 
characteristics or selection criteria that were predictive of achieving either of these outcomes at Week 
16. Similarly, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of EASI50 did not identify any baseline characteristics or 
selection criteria that were predictive of achieving a clinically relevant reduction in EASI score at Week 
16. 
The applicant indicated that IGA 0/1 and EASI-75 are chosen as preferred primary outcomes in clinical 
trials, however they have outcomes with a lower threshold and that secondary endpoints (such as IGA 
0/1/2 and EASI50) are considered more informative for the evaluation of the clinically relevant effects. 
In the clinical studies, the effect size was indeed increased with lower thresholds which are considered 
relevant for clinical practice. However, CHMP considered that the increase in efficacy even after 
consideration of MCIDs instead of primary and secondary outcomes is still modest. Nevertheless, this 
treatment effect still can be considered as clinically relevant in patients who have not responded to 
other treatment options. Therefore, the benefit of tralokinumab used as monotherapy, or in 
combination with TCS is considered to be demonstrated. As better efficacy results were reported in the 
TCS combination trial (ECZTRA 3) as compared to monotherapy studies the following statement has 
been included in sections 4.2 the SmPC: “The use of topical corticosteroids, when appropriate, may 
provide an additional effect to the overall efficacy of tralokinumab”. 
In ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies, the Q4W dose regimen was found to be less efficacious as compared to the 
Q2W regimen. For the Q4W dose regimen, a statistically (nominally) significant difference was only 
reported for the EASI-75 at Week 52 endpoint in the ECZTRA 2 study (within endpoints under 
multiplicity adjustment). Lower efficacy as compared to the Q2W regimen was also observed for the 
vast majority of other endpoints investigated in these studies. 
Based on the results on IGA0/1 and EASI-75 in the monotherapy pool, efficacy of maintenance 
treatment with tralokinumab in the Q4W dosing regimen can be accepted, however it is reflected in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC that Q4W may be less effective than Q2W. It is at the prescriber’s discretion, 
to recommend every fourth week dosing for patients who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 
16 weeks of treatment. 
In addition, for some subpopulation of patients tapering the dose to every fourth week is not 
appropriate. The reduced exposure in patients with a high body weight, coupled with the reduced 
exposure with the Q4W regimen, suggests that the Q4W regimen may not be appropriate for patients 
with a high body weight. Therefore, the section 4.4 of the SmPC states that for patients with high body 
weight, who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks of treatment, reducing the dosage to 
every fourth week might not be appropriate. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in AD patients who received tralokinumab (5.4%) compared to 
placebo (1.9%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies. Conjunctivitis 
was reported at a higher frequency in patients with severe AD compared to subjects with moderate AD 
in both the tralokinumab group (6.0 vs 3.3%; initial treatment period) and placebo group (2.2 vs 
0.8%; initial treatment period). Most patients recovered or were recovering during the treatment 
period. Conjunctivitis has been added as ADR with a frequency common in the product information. It 
is also stated in the SmPC that patients treated with tralokinumab who develop conjunctivitis that does 
not resolve following standard treatment should undergo ophthalmological examination. In addition, 
conjunctivitis is considered an important potential risk in the RMP and will be further monitored in the 
ongoing PASS (ECZTEND) which will investigate long-term safety of tralokinumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 152/153 
 
 
 
ISR (including pain and redness) occurred more frequently in patients who received tralokinumab 
(7.2%) compared to placebo (3.0%) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 
5 studies. Most ISR reported had a short duration with approximately 76% of the events resolving 
within 1 to 5 days. ISR has been listed an ADR with common frequency in the product information and 
is further described in the list of selected adverse reactions.  
Adverse reactions of eosinophilia were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with tralokinumab and 
0.3% of patients treated with placebo during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool 
of 5 studies. Tralokinumab-treated patients had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in 
eosinophil count compared to patients treated with placebo. However, the increase in the 
tralokinumab-treated patients was transient, and mean eosinophil counts returned to baseline during 
continued treatment. The safety profile for subjects with eosinophilia was comparable to the safety 
profile for all subjects. Eosinophilia has been added as an ADR with a frequency common in the product 
information and is further described in the list of selected adverse reactions. 
Eczema herpeticum was reported in 0.3% of the subjects treated with tralokinumab and in 1.5% of 
subjects in the placebo group, in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 studies 
in AD. Across all treatment periods in the pool of 5 studies, all eczema herpeticum events reported in 
the tralokinumab group were non-serious, none were severe, and a single event led to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment. Eczema herpeticum is further described in the list of selected adverse 
reactions in the product information. 
A low immunogenic potential of tralokinumab has been demonstrated in the completed clinical trials, 
and no impact on the clinical benefit/risk profile was identified. The applicant will continue to monitor 
this topic through the PASS and ongoing monitoring via routine pharmacovigilance.  
A small number of cases of malignancy were reported during the AD clinical trials but causality could 
not be elucidated. No specific measures are required for patients receiving tralokinumab; standard of 
care is considered adequate. However, as for other immunomodulatory biologics, malignancy is listed 
as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be further characterised in the ongoing PASS 
(ECZTEND).   
There is limited amount of data from the use of tralokinumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of tralokinumab during pregnancy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties remain in relation to the overall impact of tralokinumab on the severity and duration of 
conjunctivitis and the potential impact on patient compliance with longer term use of tralokinumab in 
AD. As discussed in the previous section, conjunctivitis has been included in the RMP and has been 
listed as an ADR in the SmPC with a warning, but further characterisation of eye disorders is also 
required, especially with longer term use of tralokinumab. The effect of conjunctivitis over the longer 
term will be followed-up through routine pharmacovigilance activities and the ongoing PASS 
(ECZTEND).  
The long-term safety profile of tralokinumab has not been fully characterised due to some limitations in 
exposure in the AD population and due to the absence of longer term safety data in AD patients. The 
extension trial (ECZTEND) will provide further long-term data with up to 5 years treatment with 
tralokinumab (making the total exposure for tralokinumab up to 6 years including the up to one-year 
treatment in the parent trial). Long-term safety is listed as a missing information in the safety 
concerns in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 153/154 
 
 
 
Overall there were no clear signs of an increased risk for developing malignancies based on results of 
the AD clinical trials. However, on the basis of the finding of a slight imbalance of cases of malignancy 
in the treatment group in the AD clinical development programme (tralokinumab total: 24 events; 
placebo total: 7 events), including case with fatal outcome in a young female patient (fatal metastatic 
SCC of tongue) and as literature data is inconclusive in relation to tumorigenic potential there is a need 
for further longer term data as mentioned in section 3.4. Malignancy is listed in the safety specification 
of the RMP as an important potential risk. 
Tralokinumab has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women, and no information on the 
excretion of tralokinumab in human milk or effects on the nursing infant is available. There is currently 
insufficient clinical data available to draw conclusions about the safety of using tralokinumab during 
pregnancy. Animal studies have not shown any effects on male and female reproductive organs and on 
sperm count, motility, and morphology. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
tralokinumab during pregnancy (section 4.6 of SmPC). Use in pregnant and lactating women has been 
added as a missing information in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. The safety of tralokinumab us 
in pregnant and lactating women will be monitored in an observational PASS.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy  
The analyses of the key efficacy results of all studies especially those for the initial treatment period 
(Week 0 to Week 16) show a significant higher reduction in severity and symptoms of AD compared to 
placebo. The primary endpoints (EASI-75 and IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16) were met in all these studies.

The results of secondary endpoints for the initial treatment period supported the primary endpoints 
results.   
Improvements in patients receiving tralokinumab were not only seen in relation to eczematous lesions 
on the skin but also in relation to other symptoms including pruritus, sleep disturbances (as assessed 
through the Eczema-related Sleep NRS), anxiety and depression (as assessed through the HADS 
scores). In addition, the quality of life (as assessed through DLQI) improved in patients treated with 
tralokinumab.  
Therefore, the efficacy of tralokinumab used as monotherapy or in combination with TCS is considered 
positive. As better efficacy results were reported in the TCS combination trial (ECZTRA 3) as compared 
to the monotherapy studies, it is recognised that the use of TCS, when appropriate, may provide an 
additional effect to the overall efficacy of tralokinumab. 
It is also recognised that Q4W dose regimen may be less effective than Q2W regimen. However, based 
on the results on IGA0/1 and EASI75 in the monotherapy pool, efficacy of maintenance treatment with 
tralokinumab in the Q4W dosing regimen can be accepted. It is at the prescriber’s discretion, to 
recommend every fourth week dosing for patients who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 
16 weeks of treatment. In addition, for some subpopulation of patients tapering the dose to every 
fourth week is not appropriate. The reduced exposure in patients with a high body weight, coupled with 
the reduced exposure with the Q4W regimen, suggests that the Q4W regimen may not be appropriate 
for patients with a high body weight.  
Safety 
The safety profile of tralokinumab was generally well characterised in the first 16 weeks of treatment in 
the AD population and an acceptable amount of safety data is available from the AD clinical 
development programme for the initial treatment period.  
Much of the safety information up to week 52 is acquired from the majority of patients who were non-
responders at week 16 and thus continued tralokinumab Q2W in the open-label fashion. It is apparent 
that Q4W generally has a more favourable safety profile, however it is acknowledged that more data 
are available with the higher exposure of Q2W and less with Q4W. 
The safety concerns identified in relation to tralokinumab during the safety evaluation of this 
application relate mainly to infections, eye disorders (conjunctivitis and related conditions) and 
injection site reactions. These have been reflected in the product information and will be further 
monitored via routine pharmacovigilance activities and through the ongoing long-term PASS 
(ECZTEND) listed as category 3 study in the RMP. 
Potential concerns in relation to other safety areas were also identified during the procedure, such as 
limited long term data in patients treated with the proposed dose of tralokinumab Q2W in the long 
term up to 52 weeks duration, potential concerns relating to malignancy, suicidal ideation/depressive 
symptoms and cardiovascular events. A number of serious medically important cases in a number of 
these SOCs were identified in the AD clinical development program. These points have now been 
adequately addressed by the applicant and will continue to be monitored as part of both routine 
pharmacovigilance monitoring and through the ongoing long-term PASS (ECZTEND). 
Further data on long term safety of tralokinumab in AD will be provided through the PASS (ECZTEND). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of tralokinumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients who are 
candidates for systemic therapy has been demonstrated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/266138/2021  
Page 157/158 
 
 
 
The risks associated with tralokinumab in the treatment of moderate- to- severe AD in adults have 
been adequately characterised in the clinical development programme.  Overall, based on the data 
presented the beneficial effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Adtralza is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Adtralza is favourable in the following indication: 
“Adtralza is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;

EMA/266138/2021  
Page 158/159 
 
 
 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tralokinumab is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

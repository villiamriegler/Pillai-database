2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2008 was 
based on the following grounds: 
•  Hodgkin lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 1 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was made; 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the poor long-term prognosis in 
patients that progress during or shortly after initial chemotherapy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
Community, justifications have been provided that monoclonal antibody against human CD30 
covalently linked to the cytotoxin monomethylauristatin E may be of significant benefit to those 
affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), formerly called Hodgkin's disease, arises from germinal center or post-
germinal center B cells, and is characterised by a minority of neoplastic cells (Reed-Sternberg cells and 
their variants) in an inflammatory background. There are two groups of HL, namely classical, and 
nodular lymphocyte predominant HL. Although the classification of Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) has not 
changed, the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms will 
include updates concerning nodular lymphocyte–predominant HL (NLPHL) (Swerdlow, Blood  2016  
127:2375-2390). Most patients present with a painless localized peripheral lymphadenopathy, typically 
in the cervical area, while systemic manifestations such as B-symptomatology (fever, drenching night 
sweats, weight loss) and pruritus may also be present.  Mediastinal masses are also frequent and are 
sometimes discovered after routine chest x-ray. The proposed condition continues to be a distinct 
medical entity and suitable orphan condition. 
The proposed therapeutic indication is “ADCETRIS is indicated for the frontline treatment of adult 
patients with CD30+ Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine 
and dacarbazine (AVD)” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of 
Hodgkin Lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the positive CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor has not identified any change in the seriousness of the condition since the designation. 
Mortality from HL has been progressively decreasing with recent 5-year survival rates  of more than 
80%, (Gobbi et al. Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2013 Feb;85(2):216-37 Eichenauer et al, Ann Oncol 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/115413/2019 
Page 4/8 
 
 
 
(2014) 25 (suppl 3): iii70-iii75) but the condition is still chronically debilitating and life threatening in 
particular in patients with refractory or relapsed disease. The likelihood of achieving a complete 
response to treatment and a sustained remission diminishes with second and subsequent relapses, 
while outcomes following treatment for refractory HL are even less favourable than following relapses. 
In patients who are able to undergo autologous HCT, long-term survival can approach 50% percent 
(Moskowitz, Br J Haematol. 2004;124(5):645).  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor proposes 5-, 10- and 20-year prevalence estimates to be 1.16, 2.19, and 3.92 per 
10,000, respectively. This was calculated indirectly based on the following methodology: 
• 
Incidence was first calculated for each country from national sources as far as possible. Sources for 
incidence included: the National Cancer Registry of Germany, the National Cancer Registry of 
Poland, National Cancer Registry of Netherlands, the Office of National Statistics of UK estimates 
respectively, EUREG, IARC, NORDCAN. For EU28 countries with no specific incidence data, 
extrapolations were made from the countries with available data. 
•  With regards to survival, 2000-2014 data extracted from the SEER database were used. It was 
noted that for some lower income countries adjustments were made by comparing the mortality-
to-incidence ratios as reported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 2012).  
Based on the assumed duration of up to approximately 20 years (Bessell, Bouliotis et al. British Journal 
of Cancer (2012) 107, 531–5362012) a 4 per 10,000 conclusion on prevalence was considered 
acceptable for this extension procedure.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The recommended therapeutic algorithm for newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma revolves around 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy(Eichenauer et al. Annals of Oncology 2018, 29 S4 iv19–iv29).  
The regimen ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), alone or in combination with 
BEACOPP is recommended for limited and intermediate stages, followed by involved field radiotherapy. 
Advanced -stage HL is usually treated with chemotherapy alone, and patients younger than 60 years 
are treated with either ABVD (six cycles) or BEACOPP escalated (four to six cycles), optionally followed 
by localised radiotherapy (Eichenauer et al. Annals of Oncology 2018, 29 S4 iv19–iv29). ABVD-based 
chemotherapy is discussed as the standard of care for older HL patients who are fit enough for multi-
agent chemotherapy. 
In its maintenance report, the sponsor provided a list of authorised products with indications covering 
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. From those indicated for first line treatment, most are included in the 
chemotherapy regimens ABVD and BEACOPP. The relevance of the comparisons versus those two 
standards of care for the purpose of justifying significant benefit was therefore endorsed.

Significant benefit 
The applicant provided a discussion in settings that are not directly relevant for the extension (such as 
ASCT and R/R settings), and a short discussion in front line disease based on the main study 
(ECHELON-1) that supported the marketing authorisation.  
The ECHELON-1 was the pivotal study to support the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in frontline 
treatment of adult patients with CD30+ advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) in combination with 
chemotherapy. The results showed superior efficacy for the A+AVD versus ABVD and the primary 
endpoint was mPFS, assessed in the ITT population using the revised response criteria for malignant 
lymphoma per IRF. The significant benefit versus ABVD was therefore justified. 
In particular, as of the 20 April 2017 data cut-off date for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, 
median mPFS was not reached in either treatment arm. At this time, 117 mPFS events had been 
observed in the A+AVD arm and 146 mPFS events had been observed in the ABVD arm (Figure 1). 
A+AVD was associated with a 23.0% reduction in the risk of an mPFS event versus ABVD (HR=0.770; 
95% CI, 0.603-0.983). This improvement was statistically significant (P=0.035). The proportion of 
patients free from an mPFS event at 2 years after randomization was 82.1% in the A+AVD arm versus 
77.2% in the ABVD arm (95% CI, 78.8-85.0% versus 73.7-80.4%). 
Figure 1.  KM plot of mPFS  
With regards to the significant benefit versus BEACOPP, the applicant embarked in an effort to produce 
comparisons of BEACOPP versus ABVD to argue comparable efficacy, and then to proceed with an 
argument by “extension” of the improved efficacy of A+AVD versus ABVD to also argue improved 
efficacy of A+AVD versus BEACOPP. However, the sponsor also acknowledged that “Literature is 
inconclusive on the superiority of either regimen” [referring to ABVD, BEACOPP] which makes it 
difficult to perform such an extrapolation. The COMP therefore did not consider this argument. 
Two other arguments put forwards were improved safety versus BEACOPP, focusing on its use in young 
and fit patients, as well as a major contribution to patient care. Of those arguments, the claim of a 
major contribution to patient care was not considered plausible, as patients are already engaged in 
complex chemotherapy regimens, and there was an absence of PRO data confirming improvements 
linked to the new posology.

On the other hand the available European ESMO guidelines, point out that the BEACOPP regimen is not 
recommended in patients with an age of more than 60 years old. This point was further explored with 
the applicant, given that the authorised indication of Adcetris does not have an age restriction. The 
sponsor was asked in particular to document the issues necessitating a restriction of BEACOPP use in 
the older population.  
In response, the sponsor firstly noted that the epidemiology of the disease has two well known peaks, 
with the second affecting patients after the 6th decade of life.

https://www.hmrn.org/statistics/incidence. Accessed Apr 24, 2018; 2. Skoetz N, et al. Cochrane Database Syst 
Rev. 2017;5:CD007941; 3. Gatta G, et al. Eur J Cancer. 2011;47(17):2493-511. 
The applicant further elaborated on the treatment related mortality as described in the literature. In a 
2009 publication for the HD9 trial from the German Hodgkin Study Group (Engert et al, Journal of 
Clinical Oncology 27(27): 4548-4554), the respective treatment related mortality led to the change in 
upper age limit for future use in GHSG trials to 60 years old. The increased treatment related mortality 
in patients over 40 and 50 years was also documents in a retrospective analysis of the HD9, HD12 and 
HD15 studies (Wongso D J Clin Oncol 31:2819-2824, 2013). 
In contrast, the newly approved indication for Adcetris has no age-restriction. With reference to the 
CHMP assessment, elderly patients with stage IV HL have a trend towards a slightly favourable mPFS 
treated with A+AVD versus ABVD [n=118 age ≥60] (mPFS per IRF: HR = 0.804 (95% CI: 0.42 to 
1.53), p = 0.506) and for age ≥65 [n=78] HR = 0.777 (95% CI: 0.36 to 1.67), p = 0.515). The 
subsets of elderly patients with Stage IV HL (n=118 patients aged ≥60; n=78 patients aged ≥65) is 
relatively small. Even so, among elderly patients with Stage IV HL, favourable trends for mPFS and OS 
were observed. 
The COMP accepted based on these justifications that the A+AVD combination would be applicable in a 
broader population compared to (esc) BEACOPP.

4.  COMP position adopted on 24 January 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Hodgkin lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the poor long-term prognosis in 
patients that progress during or shortly after initial chemotherapy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Adcetris may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition still holds. The applicant has provided clinical data in the first line treatment of 
advanced Hodgkin lymphoma, that show improved progression free survival when the product is 
added on to AVD versus that obtained with ABVD, the latter being one of the two standard of care 
regimens; 
• 
the committee also considered that (escalated) BEACOPP, the other standard of care, is used in 
younger patients, due to the increasing treatment related mortality with age and as attested by the 
respective European practice guidelines. In contrast, there is no age restriction with respect to the 
use of Adcetris. The COMP considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Adcetris, monoclonal antibody 
against human CD30 covalently linked to the cytotoxin monomethylauristatin E, brentuximab vedotin, 
EU/3/08/596 for treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

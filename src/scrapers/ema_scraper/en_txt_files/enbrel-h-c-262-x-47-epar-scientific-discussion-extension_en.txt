1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Enbrel (etanercept) is a sterile, preservative-free, lyophilised powder for subcutaneous injection after 
reconstitution with 1-mL sterile water for injections. Etanercept is a fully human protein produced by 
recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mammalian expression system 
and  is  comprised  of  the  extracellular  domains  of  two  human  tumour  necrosis  factor  receptors 
(TNFR2/p75) attached to the Fc domain of human IgG1. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has 
an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. 
The  original  approved  product  was  Enbrel  25  mg:  each  vial  contains  25  mg  of  etanercept.  The 
recommended dosing schedule for Enbrel  25  mg in adults with rheumatoid  arthritis is  25  mg twice-
weekly. The administration of 50 mg once weekly, using two 25 mg injections given on the same day 
has been approved by Type II variation on 23 July 2004.  For plaque psoriasis, the recommended dose 
of Enbrel is 25 mg administered twice weekly.  Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used 
for up to 12 weeks followed, if necessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly.   
This application was an extension application for a new 50 mg strength of Enbrel for use in adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis or plaque psoriasis according to the recommended dosing schedules. 
The formulation for the 50 mg vial is identical to the approved 25 mg vial except that the amount of 
etanercept has been doubled. A once-weekly dosing regimen using the 50 mg vial would substantially 
improve the convenience of use for patients who self-administer Enbrel and thus improve compliance.

QUALITY ASPECTS 
There are no changes to the active substance. Enbrel 50 mg/vial drug product differs from Enbrel 25 
mg/vial drug product only in the amount of etanercept protein that is filled into the vial. There are no 
modifications in the identity, quality or quantities of excipients of the medicinal product. 
The  main  pharmaceutical  development  issues  were  those  associated  with  optimisation  of  a  revised 
freeze-drying  (lyophilisation)  cycle  for  the  product,  which  is  effectively  25  mg  heavier  due  to  the 
additional quantity of active substance. 
Appropriate  pharmaceutical  development  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  new  lyophilisation 
cycle and the critical lyophilisation parameters for 50 mg/vial Enbrel drug product have been defined. 
Three  lots  of  50  mg/mL  process  intermediate  batches  were  prepared  at  pilot  scale  under  GMP 
conditions at Amgen’s Cell Culture Facility in Bothell, Washington, USA. The starting material was 
25  mg/mL  GMP  pilot  drug  substance  manufactured  at  the  Bothell  Cell  Culture  Facility.  The  GMP 
pilot  50  mg/mL process intermediate  batches  were  stored in stainless  steel  containers and  placed  on 
stability at -20°C, plus accelerated testing at 2°C  to 8°C  and 25°C. These met all specifications when 
stored  in  stainless  steel  containers  for  6  months  at  -20°C  or  for  3  months  at  2°C   to  8°C.  
Developmental studies  show  that 50  mg/mL  process intermediate can  undergo  freezing  and thawing 
under fast and slow conditions for up to ten cycles without impacting protein quality. 
Satisfactory validation of the process parameters, including the sterilising filters has been performed. 
Four drug product GMP conformance lots (307283, 307305, 307306, 307307) were manufactured in 
the production freeze dryers. These lots have been placed on stability at 2°C to 8°C plus accelerated 
stability at 25°C and 40°C. During the manufacture of the conformance lots, additional sampling was 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
performed  to  examine  vial-to-vial  and  shelf-to-shelf  variability.    These  samples  were  analysed  for 
reconstitution time and percentage of residual moisture and found to be consistent and acceptable. 
The  batch  analysis  data  for  bioequivalence  and  four  conformance  lots  demonstrate  compliance  with 
release specifications.   
The  recommended  drug  product  storage  is  2°C  to  8°C  for  24  months  (to  be  confirmed  by  ongoing 
stability studies). GMP pilot lots are stable for 3 months at 25°C.  During the procedure, the applicant 
took the opportunity to provide additional data to justify the shelf life of 3 years, which is the same as 
that for the currently authorised 25mg product. 
The  data  provided  from  pilot  lots  indicated  that  the  stability  profile  for  50  mg/vial  drug  product  is 
comparable  to  that  of  the  current  25  mg/vial  drug  product.  Data  from  the  commercial  lots  of  50 
mg/vial drug product are consistent with historical data for the current 25 mg/vial drug product.  The 
commercial scale stability study is designed to confirm 36 months expiry at the recommended storage 
condition  of  2°C  to  8°C.    The  applicant  requests  to  establish  the  expiry  dating  at  36  months  on  the 
basis of the 18-month pilot scale data and the 6-month commercial scale data. 
The applicant commits to report any out of specification results from the on-going commercial scale 
stability studies for Enbrel 50 mg with an assessment of the results and proposed corrective action. 
The results provided support an extension of the expiry date of the 50 mg/vial product from 24 to 36 
months when stored at 2°C to 8°C. 
There  are  no  major  quality  issues  associated  with  the  development  of  the  new  lyophilised  product 
containing  50  mg  of  etanercept  intended  for  once  weekly  administration  in  adults  with  rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
In  the  List  of  Questions,  one  area  of  potential  deficiency  was  identified,  regarding  the  analysis  of 
aggregate  formation  in  the  new  50  mg  product.    The  applicant  has  subsequently  confirmed  using 
suitably sensitive methodology (size exclusion HPLC and SDS-PAGE) that processing etanercept 50 
mg/ml  does  not  result  in  a  significant  increase  in  aggregate  formation.  The  applicant  also  provided 
further justification regarding the scale and expiry dates of batches used for pharmacokinetic studies.

3.   CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Two clinical studies have been submitted by the applicant to support this extension application: 
Study 16.0036: Investigating the efficacy and safety of etanercept 25 mg twice weekly and 
50 mg once weekly (2 stimultaneous 25-mg injections) compared with placebo in adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis. (Previously provided with Variation EMEA/H/C/262/II/37). 
Study 20021643: A comparative bioavailability study of the pharmacokinetics of one 50 mg 
injection and 2 simultaneous 25 mg injections of etanercept. 
The first study (16.0036) was the basis for the variation  EMEA/H/C/262/II/37, that was approved on 
23 July 2004. The second study (20021643) is a bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetic 
profile of two simultaneous injections of Enbrel 25 mg to one injection of Enbrel 50 mg. 
Bioavailability/ bioequivalence 
Study 20021643 was a single centre, open-label, randomised, crossover study with a wash-out period 
of at least 28 days in 30 healthy volunteers of whom 28 completed the study. Study power calculation 
was  based  on  26  subject  providing  an  80%  power  to  determine  comparability  if  the  intra-subject 
coefficient of variation ( RSD) lower than 25%.   
Serum concentrations of etanercept were measured by ELISA with a LLOQ of 0.625 ng/ml. 
The  results  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  etanercept  (arithmetic  mean  (SD)  and  LS  geometric 
mean, except for tmax, median and range) were as follows:

92.5 - 113.1 
93.8 - 115.1 
95.9 - 124.6 
Results  indicate  that  the  bioequivalence  criteria  (AUC(0-∞)  point  estimate  of  99.5  with  a  90% 
confidence  interval  from  90.0  to  110.1;  AUC(0-t)  point  estimate  of  101.1  with  a  90%  confidence 
interval from 91.3 to 112.0 and Cmax point estimate of 106.4 with a 90% confidence interval from 93.3 
to 121.2) were met. 
Plasma  levels  at  pre-dose  samples  were  above  the  LLOQ  in  26  out  of  28  subjects,  because  an 
insufficient wash-out period was allowed, indicating the presence of a carry-over effect. When these 
levels of AUC are compared with Cmax of the second period, they appear to be higher than 1% of the 
pre-dose levels, the latter stipulated as expected in the protocol. 
Statistical analysis showed a significant period effect for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞.  
There were no serious adverse events. As expected, the most commonly reported adverse events were 
injection site reactions (12 subjects) with no difference between the two formulations. 
The  results  of  the  bioequivalence  study  confirm  similar  average  bioavailability  between  the  two 
formulations. 
There are no new safety concerns.

CONCLUSION 
Benefit/risk assessment 
The CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk balance for the proposed new dosage strength of 50 mg for 
Enbrel was considered to be positive. 
Overall conclusions 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  benefit/risk  balance  for  Enbrel  50  mg  for  the  treatment  of  active  rheumatoid 
arthritis  and  plaque  psoriasis,  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation.

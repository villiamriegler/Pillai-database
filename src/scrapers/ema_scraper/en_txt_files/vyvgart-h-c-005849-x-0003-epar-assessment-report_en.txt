2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Generalized myasthenia gravis is a rare, chronic, neuromuscular autoimmune disease mediated by pathogenic 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies, binding to acetylcholine receptors or to functionally related molecules 
in  the  postsynaptic  membrane  at  the  neuromuscular  junction, which  causes  debilitating  and  potentially  life-
threatening muscle weakness. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The disease presents with two peaks of incidence, below or above the age of 50, termed early-onset MG and 
late-onset  MG,  respectively.  The  incidence  ranges  from  0.3  to 2.8  per  100,000  and  it  is  estimated  to  affect 
more than 700,000 people worldwide. 
Myasthenia gravis is considered to affect less than 2 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). 
2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
MG is considered a model antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, since in most cases the autoantibodies and 
target antigens are well-characterized. The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is confirmed by the combination of 
relevant symptoms and signs and a positive test for specific autoantibodies (antibodies against acetylcholine 
receptors  ~85%,  muscle-specific  kinase  ~6%,  and  lipoprotein  receptor–  related  protein  ~2%).  The 
pathogenicity of all these autoantibodies has been shown by the development of passive transfer experimental 
autoimmune MG when injected into laboratory animals and by the improvement of patients' symptoms following 
plasmapheresis. Some patients do not have detectable antibodies against any of these antigens, being referred 
to as seronegative MG. Antibodies against various other extracellular or intracellular targets are found in several 
MG  patients  (e.g.,  agrin,  colQ,  Kv1.4,  titin).  MG  pathogenesis,  its  clinical  presentation  and  the  response  of 
patients to therapy vary depending on the pattern of autoantibodies detected. 
The pathogenic actions of IgG autoantibodies include functional blockade of AChR, accelerated internalization 
and degradation of AChR, and activation of the complement system. These pathogenic actions result in reduced 
density of functional AChR and simplification of the neuromuscular junction, leading to failure of neuromuscular 
transmission.  Anti-AChR  autoantibodies  are  of  the  IgG1  and  IgG3  subtypes.  Anti-MuSK  (Muscle-Specific 
receptor tyrosine Kinase) autoantibodies are IgG4 subtype and do not activate the complement pathway. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In  about  two-thirds  of  patients,  the  first  symptom  is  weakness  of  extrinsic  ocular  muscles.  In  1  of  10  MG 
patients, symptoms remain limited to extrinsic ocular muscles (ocular myasthenia gravis). However, in more 
than 80% of patients, the symptoms progress within 2 years to affect other bulbar muscles as well as limb 
muscles  (gMG).  The  generalized  muscle  weakness  leads  to  difficulties  in  mobility,  speech,  swallowing,  and 
vision,  as  well  as  impaired  respiratory  function  and  extreme  fatigue.  Up  to  20%  of  patients  experience 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 10/173 
 
 
potentially  life-threatening  myasthenic  crisis,  with  respiratory  failure  requiring  mechanical  ventilation.  In 
approximately 90% of patients, IgG autoantibodies are detected in the serum, with the most common being 
against  AChR.  The  remaining  10%  of  patients  may  have  autoantibodies  that  are  undetectable,  at  a 
concentration less than the assay’s lower limit of detection, or against epitopes undetectable in the assay or 
that bind an unknown target. In patients with undetectable autoantibodies, the diagnosis is determined through 
neurophysiological  examination,  including  repetitive  nerve  stimulation  or  single-fiber  electromyography,  and 
symptomatic improvement following treatment with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. 
The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification categorizes patients according to 
clinical  evaluation,  which  in  increasing  severity  can  be,  ocular  MG;  mild,  moderate,  severe  generalized 
symptoms  of  MG;  MG  that  requires  intubation.  Validated  symptom  scales  including  the  Myasthenia  Gravis 
Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL), Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG), and Myasthenia Gravis Composite 
(MGC)  scores  are  used  to  assess  and  track  the  clinical  and  functional  burden  of  MG,  whereas  the  15-item 
Quality of Life scale for Myasthenia Gravis (MG-QoL15r) measures the impact of MG on the patient’s quality of 
life. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current  treatment  options  include  acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors,  short-term  immune  therapies  such  as 
plasmapheresis  or 
intravenous 
immunoglobulin 
(IVIg),  and 
long-term 
immune 
therapies  with 
immunosuppressive  agents  such  as  corticosteroids,  azathioprine,  cyclosporine,  and  mycophenolate,  but 
tacrolimus,  methotrexate,  and  cyclophosphamide  are  also  used.  Thymectomy  is  also  a  treatment  option. 
Monoclonal  antibodies  such  as  eculizumab,  ravulizumab  or  rituximab  are  used  for  more  refractory  cases. 
Efgartigimod IV was approved in 2022 and the therapeutic area is expanding. 
Plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PLEX) and IVIg are typically used for treatment of severe exacerbations of 
gMG. 
A  considerable  variation  exists  in  the  management  of  gMG,  and  treatment  is  not  standardized.  There  is  no 
consensus on the choice of immunosuppressive agent and widespread use of particular agents remains, even 
though available data from a randomized controlled study do not support their use in MG (Sussman 20181, 
Hart  2007 2 ,  Schneider-Gold  2019 3 ).  With  the  exception  of  AChE  inhibitors,  azathioprine,  the  complement 
inhibitors  eculizumab  and  ravulizumab,  and  the  FcRn  antagonist  efgartigimod  IV,  which  have  received 
regulatory approval in Europe for the treatment of gMG subgroups, all other existing therapies are used off-
label. 
The  use  of  corticosteroids  for  the  treatment  of  gMG  is  based  on  observational  rather  than  high-quality 
randomized  controlled  clinical  studies  (Sieb  2014 4 ,  Schneider-Gold  2019 5 ).  The  immunosuppressants 
cyclosporin  and  tacrolimus  have  each  failed  to  significantly  reduce  the  doses  of  corticosteroid  required  to

maintain disease control in prospective double-blinded studies (Tindall 19936, Yosikawa 20117). In a phase 3 
study, mycophenolate mofetil was not superior to placebo in maintaining MG control during a 36-week schedule 
of prednisone tapering (Sanders 20088). In the BeatMG study, rituximab failed to meet its primary endpoint, 
assessing the percentage of patients who achieve a ≥75% reduction in mean daily prednisone dose in the 4 
weeks prior to week 52 and have clinical improvement of no worsening of symptoms (≤2-point increase in MGC 
score), in the rituximab and placebo arms. 
Current therapies for gMG either provide inadequate control of the disease or are associated with an increased 
risk of serious side effects or patient inconvenience, which may limit their use. 
AChE  inhibitors  are  short-acting  and  often  need  to  be  taken  several  times  daily.  Their  efficacy  in  AChR-Ab 
seronegative  patients  is  limited  (Sanders  2016 9 ).  Furthermore,  patients  rarely  achieve  amelioration  of 
symptoms with AChE inhibitors alone and the majority of patients require additional treatment with unlicensed 
steroids and nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs (NSIDs). The use of AChE inhibitors is also constrained by 
the well-defined cholinergic side effects which limit the doses that can be tolerated, and additional treatment 
is  often  required  to  manage  adverse  effects.  For  example,  the  pyridostigmine  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) makes clear that atropine or other anticholinergic drugs may be necessary to counteract 
the muscarinic effects. 
Eculizumab is indicated in patients who have refractory gMG and who are AChR-Ab seropositive. In addition, 
the  eculizumab  SmPC  carries  a  warning  for  the  risk  of  serious  meningococcal  infections,  and  vaccination  is 
essential prior to treatment. The Soliris European Public Assessment Report estimates that the gMG patient 
subset for which eculizumab is indicated represents approximately 10% of patients with generalized disease. 
This is supported by 2 European publications: 
• UK retrospective Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics databases study: 66 of 
1149 (5.7%) patients met criteria for refractory gMG 
• Austria tertiary centre chart review: 14 of 126 patients (11.1%) met criteria of treatment-refractory MG 
Long-term use of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) is associated with serious side effects such as hypertension, 
diabetes,  osteoporosis,  and  gastrointestinal  effects.  Long-term  use  of  NSIDs  like  azathioprine,  MMF,  and 
methotrexate may be associated with  severe side  effects that  vary by agent but can include liver and bone 
marrow toxicities, malignancies, and increased risk of infection. NSIDs have an extended delay in their onset 
of action; azathioprine is usually only effective after 12 months, and mycophenolate requires 6 to 12 months 
of treatment before being effective. PLEX is a lengthy and burdensome procedure and is usually conducted in 
a hospital or specialized clinical setting. IVIg use is limited in patients who are at risk of renal dysfunction and 
those who have a history of hypertension or risk factors for thrombotic events. IVIg use is further limited by 
potential shortages. Shortages in IVIg have been reported in Europe, with measures implemented to restrict 
the use of IVIg in gMG and may have been enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely severely impacted 
patient care.

Patients with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG have greater limitations on treatment options, as AChE inhibitors are 
known to have reduced efficacy in this population and new treatments like C5 or FcRn inhibitors are approved 
only for AChR-Ab seropositive patients.  
Importantly, between the MG subgroups, the therapeutic regime can differ. Patients with MuSK antibodies tend 
to have more severe symptoms and generalized  weakness, whereas treatment withdrawal in these  patients 
can often lead to disease exacerbation. In addition, MuSK-MG patients can present with adverse effects when 
treated with pyridostigmine, an AChE inhibitor commonly used as a first-line treatment for MG, while there is 
little  evidence  to  support  the  usefulness  of  thymectomy  in  these  patients.  On  the  other  hand,  they  usually 
greatly benefit from PLEX, and they have a very good response  to the administration of rituximab, possibly 
more pronounced than the other MG subgroups. AChR antibody positive patients who also have titin or RyR 
antibodies  tend  to  have  more  severe  disease,  while  in  the  case  of  early  onset  MG  they  are  indicative  of 
thymoma. The benefit of thymectomy is questionable in patients with seronegative MG, MuSK-MG and LRP4-
MG since they usually lack the typical thymus pathology seen in AChR-MG. Especially in the case of Japanese 
patients,  the  presence  of  Kv1.4  antibodies  has  been  associated  with  cardiac  dysfunction  and  severe 
complications, so they should be monitored accordingly. The seronegative patients might have higher chance 
of ocular MG or better outcome than AChR-MG or MuSK-MG. It is, therefore, important to detect the autoantigen 
targeted in each patient for adopting the best treatment options. 
Recently, a new class of treatment, neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) antagonists, has emerged as an add-on to 
standard therapy with a new mechanism of action targeting the underlying disease (e.g. Efgartigimod). FcRn 
has a specific role in IgG homeostasis by recycling IgG and rescuing it from lysosomal degradation. 
2.2.  About the product 
Efgartigimod alfa is a human recombinant immunoglobulin 1(IgG1) derived Fc fragment produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) by recombinant DNA technology. Efgartigimod alfa is engineered for increased affinity to 
the  FcRn.  Efgartigimod  alfa  binds  to  FcRn,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  the  levels  of  circulating  IgG  including 
pathogenic IgG autoantibodies. 
Pharmacological classification: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA58.  
Vyvgart 20 mg/mL, concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion (also referred to as efgartigimod IV), was 
approved in the European Union on 10 August 2022 as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of 
adult patients with gMG who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive (EU/1/22/1674/001). The sought 
indication is the same for SC formulation.  
The recommended dose is 1000 mg to be administered subcutaneously in cycles of once weekly injections for 
4 weeks. Administer subsequent treatment cycles according to clinical evaluation. The frequency of treatment 
cycles may vary by patient. If a scheduled injection is not possible, treatment may be administered up to 3 
days before or after the scheduled time point.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH did not seek for any scientific advice / protocol assistance from EMA during clinical development for 
gMG. A presubmission meeting with the (co)-rapporteur was held on 14 June 2022 to discuss this filing. 
The MAH received feedback from FDA through three FDA type C meetings (04 Dec 2020, 08 Jun 2022, 12 Jul 
2022) on various issues: quality (chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, nonclinical), clinical development of 
efgartigimod  PH20  SC  for the  treatment  of  gMG  including  topics  on  self-administration,  drug  substance  and

2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection for subcutaneous (SC) administration containing 
1000 mg (180 mg/mL) of efgartigimod alfa as active substance.  
Other  ingredients  are:  recombinant  human  hyaluronidase  (rHuPH20),  L-histidine,  L-histidine  hydrochloride 
monohydrate, L-methionine, polysorbate 20 (PS20), sodium chloride, sucrose and water for injections. 
The finished product is available in a single-dose 6 mL type I glass vials with rubber stopper, aluminium seal 
and polypropylene flip-off cap. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General Information 
Reference  is  made  to  Section  3.2.S.1  General  Information  for  the  efgartigimod  20  mg/mL  active  substance 
previously authorized with the finished product concentrate for solution for infusion. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
 The active substance is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality-control tested in accordance with 
good  manufacturing  practice  (GMP).  The  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  is  manufactured  by  the 
same  site  responsible  for  the  manufacture  of  the  previously  authorized  20  mg/mL  active  substance  (Lonza 
Biologics Tuas Pte. Ltd., 35 Tuas South Avenue 6, Tuas 637377, Singapore). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process for efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance is based on a recombinant Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, containing the DNA sequence for the efgartigimod protein. The process strongly 
resembles a standard platform monoclonal antibody manufacturing process. In brief, cells from a vial of the 
working  cell  bank  (WCB)  are  thawed  and  the  cells  are  progressively  expanded  prior  to  inoculation  of  the 
production bioreactor. Upon completion of the cell culture, the production bioreactor contents are harvested by 
depth filtration to remove cells and cell debris and then filtered prior to further purification. Purification consists 
of  chromatography  steps,  virus  inactivation/reduction  steps,  and  a  concentration  and  diafiltration  step. 
Following concentration and diafiltration (UF/DF) into the formulation buffer, the active substance undergoes 
excipient addition and is then bulk filtered and dispensed into the active substance containers.  
Up to and including the last viral reduction step, the manufacturing process for efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active 
substance is identical to the process for the already authorized efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance, as 
implemented  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas  (Singapore).  Reference  is  made  to  Section  3.2.S.2.2  Description  of 
Assessment report

Manufacturing Process and Controls for the efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance for information regarding 
the manufacturing process description and process controls up to and including the viral reduction filtration.  
Flow diagrams have been included in the dossier indicating the raw materials used and the critical and non-
critical  process  parameters  (CCPs  and  non-CPPs)  and  quality  attributes  identified  for  each  process  step.  In-
process  testing  involves  determination  of  adventitious  agents  at  relevant  stages,  including  bioburden  and 
endotoxin levels and filter integrity testing.  
Possibility of reprocessing is suggested in case of events related to specified process steps. No reprocessing is 
allowed  due  to  non-compliant  bioburden  levels.  Reprocessing  of  the  abovementioned  process  steps  will  be 
qualified by means of prospective qualification protocols, describing the requirements for qualification of the 
reprocessing steps. This approach is endorsed. 
Adequate  resin  reuse  information  was  provided  in  the  dossier  for  the  multi-use  resins.  The  lifetime  will  be 
verified at full scale under a concurrent validation protocol. This approach is found acceptable. 
Overall, the efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. 
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
The  container  closure  system  for  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  is  identical  with  the  container 
closure system used for previously authorized efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance manufactured at Lonza 
Biologics, Slough (UK). The container closure system (CCS) is therefore found acceptable. 
A risk assessment to evaluate potential extractables/leachables in the manufacturing process stream during 
the manufacture of efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance at Lonza Biologics, Tuas was performed to ensure 
compliance, safety and stability. All components that come in contact with the efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active 
substance  during  the  manufacturing  process  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas  (including  CCS)  were  found  to  be 
compliant,  within  acceptable  risk  for  leachables  and  pose  no  threat  to  the  safety  or  quality  of  the  product. 
Overall, the extractables/leachable risk assessment results are considered acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Reference  is  made  to  Section  3.2.S.2.3  Control  of  Materials  for  the  previously  authorized  efgartigimod  20 
mg/mL active substance manufactured at Lonza Biologics, Tuas for information on raw and starting materials 
used  for  cell  culture  stages,  as  well  as  for  the  harvest  and  purification  steps.  In  summary,  compendial  raw 
materials  are  tested  in  accordance  with  the  corresponding  monograph,  while  specifications  (including  test 
methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No raw materials of animal or human origin are 
used  for  the  manufacture  of  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance,  except  for  the  recombinant  CHO 
production cell line.  
For  information  on  the  source,  history  and  generation  of  the  cell  substrate,  as  well  as  for  master  cell  bank 
(MCB), working cell bank (WCB) and end of production cell bank (EOPC) generation, characterization, genetic 
stability and safety testing, cell line stability evaluation and generation of future WCB, reference is made to 
Section 3.2.S.2.3 Control of Materials for previously authorized efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Controls  for  all  the  critical  steps  have  been  established  to  ensure  consistent  quality  of  efgartigimod  active 
substance produced by the commercial manufacturing process. The controls and limits were established based 
on  historical  knowledge  (development  and  clinical  data),  process  characterization  studies  and  process 
performance  qualification  (PPQ)  studies.  Also,  PPQ  studies  performed  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas  for  the 
efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance were taken into account where relevant, due to the similarity of the

manufacturing process to the current efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance manufacturing process. This 
approach is considered acceptable as the process is identical up to and including the last virus reduction step. 
CPPs including acceptable range/limits are presented for the concentration and diafiltration, excipient addition 
and bulk filtration, dispensing and storage. The in-process controls (IPCs) in place are considered adequate to 
ensure that the active substance manufacturing process is in control and the corresponding acceptance criteria 
are considered appropriate. The microbial control strategy is considered adequate. 
There  are  no  process  intermediates  for  the  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  manufacturing  process.  Regarding  the 
established in-process hold times for each manufacturing step up to and including the last virus reduction step, 
reference is made to Section 3.2.S.2.4 Controls of Critical Steps and Intermediates for the previously authorized 
efgartigimod  20  mg/mL  active  substance  manufactured  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas.  For  the  UF/DF  pool  and 
formulated bulk, the validated in-process hold times are presented and are found acceptable. 
Process validation 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  was  validated  at  the 
commercial scale at Lonza Biologics, Tuas using 4 process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. 
The  process  control  strategy  for  the  manufacture  of  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  has  been 
established  based  on  and  following  a  similar  approach  as  for  efgartigimod  20  mg/mL  active  substance. 
Acceptance criteria for process validation parameters were established based on Lonza platform knowledge, 
characterization studies and data from runs at the commercial scale. An interim risk assessment, to define and 
classify process inputs and outputs based on their criticality, was performed prior to running the PPQ campaign. 
CPPs and selected non-CPPs were monitored during the PPQ campaign to demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process could be executed within the established process parameter acceptable ranges and provided product 
which consistently met its pre-defined quality attributes. The critical quality attributes (CQA), quality attributes 
(QA) and performance attributes (PA) (outputs) were evaluated to assure the process performed as designed. 
Following  completion  of  the  PPQ  campaign,  the  CQAs  were  reassessed  and  a  final  risk  assessment  was 
conducted to determine the final critical parameters and attributes and their corresponding acceptable ranges 
for the intended commercial manufacturing process and associated process control strategy. 
The initial cell culture, harvest and downstream process validation was executed using batches derived from 
the same WCB using independent thaws and demonstrated acceptable process performance and batch to batch 
consistency. The purification process demonstrated consistent and effective removal of host cell-derived, cell 
culture media-derived and purification process-derived impurities. All PPQ batches complied with the applied 
QC release acceptance criteria.  
In addition to the PPQ validation study, studies were conducted to support the product process validation. A 
few studies were not performed, as the manufacturing processes for efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance 
(Process LC2.2) and efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance (Process HC2.2) are identical up to and including 
the  last  virus  reduction  step,  and  the  validation  performed  for  efgartigimod  20  mg/mL  active  substance  is 
applicable. 
A  summary  of  the  shipping  validation  was  provided  at  the  required  temperatures  for  the  active  substance 
transportation, demonstrating that the shipping container is qualified to maintain product storage temperature 
when  subjected  to  thermal  stress  condition  and  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  active  substance  packaging 
following exaggerated physical stress.  
In  conclusion,  the  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  manufacturing  process  conducted  at  Lonza 
Biologics,  Tuas  has  been  successfully  validated  through  the  PPQ  studies  performed  at  the  respective  site.  A

continued process verification (CPV) program is in place in order to demonstrate an ongoing state of control 
over the lifecycle of the product.  
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process for efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance (high concentration, HC) has been 
developed by Lonza Biologics, Tuas based on the manufacturing process for already authorized efgartigimod 
20 mg/mL active substance (low concentration, LC).  
To  develop  a  new  formulation  and  product  presentation  suitable  for  subcutaneous  administration,  different 
changes  were  introduced  stepwise  in  the  active  substance  manufacturing  processes.  The  manufacturing 
processes  for  both  the  approved  LC  manufacturing  process  (LC2.2,  for  intravenous  (IV)  formulation  of 
efgartigimod)  and  the  intended  commercial  HC  manufacturing  process  (HC2.2,  for  subcutaneous  (SC) 
formulation of efgartigimod) are essentially identical, up to and including the virus reduction step. During the 
subsequent concentration and diafiltration step, the active substance is formulated in its final designated (IV 
or SC) formulation buffer. After the concentration and diafiltration step, polysorbate is added (polysorbate 80 
for  the  IV  formulation  and  polysorbate  20  for  the  SC  formulation),  followed  by  the  final  active  substance 
filtration and filling step. The intended commercial manufacturing processes for efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active 
substance has the formulation corresponding to 180 mg/mL efgartigimod in L-histidine/ L-histidine HCl, sodium 
chloride, sucrose, L-methionine, PS20. 
Two major process versions have been used thus far for the manufacture of efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active 
substance:  the  initial  (non-commercial)  Process  HC1.0  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Slough,  UK  (used  for  non-clinical 
safety and clinical Phase 1 studies, as well as Phase 3 clinical trials) and the intended commercial Process HC2.0 
at Lonza Biologics, Tuas, Singapore (used for Phase 1 bridging studies and Phase 3 clinical trials).   
The  changes  implemented  have  been  adequately  described  and  justified.  Comparability  across  different 
manufacturing  process  versions,  have  been  adequately  demonstrated,  based  on  comprehensive  analytical 
comparability  data  packages,  including  release,  in-process,  extended  characterization  and  stability  data  in 
accordance  with  ICH  Q5E  guideline.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  changes  made  to  the  active 
substance manufacturing process did not have a significant influence on the quality of the product. 
Characterisation 
The elucidation of the primary structure conducted at protein, peptide and glycan level is described, as well as 
the higher-order structure, product-related variants/product heterogeneity, biological activity, active substance 
characteristics and characterization of efgartigimod variants, based on characterization studies with the current 
working reference standard formulated at 180 mg/mL. The characterization results were generated by side-
by-side testing with the 20 mg/mL primary reference standard. All relevant structure-related quality attributes 
were addressed during characterization studies, using several orthogonal state-of-the-art analytical methods. 
Reference is also made to Section 3.2.S.3.1 Characterization for the already authorized efgartigimod 20 mg/mL 
active substance. 
The results demonstrate that efgartigimod active substance has the expected structure of an IgG1 Fc fragment 
with increased binding specificity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and that intrinsic structure and properties 
of the molecule remain intact, irrespective of the concentration and the formulation buffer. In summary, the 
characterization is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Impurities present in efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance are classified as product-related impurities and 
process-related impurities. Adequate information regarding the heterogeneity of the active substance has been 
presented by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 17/173 
 
 
For  the  process-related  impurities  that  may  potentially  be  present  in  efgartigimod  active  substance,  the 
applicant proposed appropriate control strategy and/or justification for not performing routine testing. 
2.3.2.3.   Specification 
The  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  specification  complies  with  the  provisions  of  ICH  Q6B  and 
includes: testing for visual appearance, content, pH, identity, purity, potency, PS20 concentration, impurities 
and  microbial  impurities.  Testing  for  absence  of  mycoplasma  and  adventitious  viruses  is  performed  as  in-
process  controls  on  unprocessed  bulk  harvest,  which  is  deemed  acceptable.  The  analytical  methods  and 
acceptance criteria applied during stability studies are identical to the active substance release specifications, 
except for the identity, safety, process-related impurities and PS20 which are tested only at release. 
The proposed commercial specifications are set based on data from all active substance batches manufactured 
up to and including the PPQ batches. For some of the purity parameters, slightly wider limits for efgartigimod 
180 mg/mL active substance compared to efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance are introduced, for which 
the applicant provided adequate justification. The acceptance criteria for potency testing and for size-related 
variants were also initially proposed by the applicant to be wider than the acceptance criteria for the currently 
approved efgartigimod 20 mg/ml active substance, however this was not found to be justified by PPQ data and, 
therefore, the applicant was requested to further tighten these limits and align with the approved acceptance 
limits for efgartigimod 20 mg/mL. The applicant was requested to also tighten the endotoxin acceptance limit 
and, although not aligned with the limit for efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance, the proposed acceptance 
criteria for endotoxin determination is acceptable.  
In summary, the proposed tests panel and acceptance criteria for batch release/stability testing are considered 
adequate.  
Analytical methods 
The applicant has provided brief, but adequate descriptions have been provided for all compendial methods. 
Descriptions of all non-compendial methods have been provided, including principle, reagents, procedure (high-
level), assay/system and sample suitability criteria, and evaluation and reporting of results.  
Compendial  methods  used  to  test  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  are  identical  (except  for  the 
endotoxin method) to the methods involved in testing of efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance.  
Non-compendial analytical procedures used to test efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance are also identical 
to the analytical procedures used for efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance, except (where applicable) for 
the  initial  sample  preparation  step.  The  method  description  for  PS20  concentration  is  new  and  is  found 
adequate.  
Overall, the documentation provided for the validation of analytical procedures for efgartigimod 180 mg/mL 
active substance is considered comprehensive and  the analytical methods are considered validated for their 
use. 
Batch analysis  
Batch  analysis  data  of  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  historical  non-clinical  and  clinical  batches  (batches 
manufactured at Lonza Biologics, Tuas and 9 batches manufactured at Lonza Biologics, Slough), PPQ batches 
and post-PPQ batches are presented. All results comply with the specification in place at the time of testing 
and overall batch-to-batch consistency of the manufacturing process is demonstrated.

Reference materials 
The  quality  of  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  is  monitored  by  a  two-tiered  reference  standard 
approach, using a primary reference standard (PRS) and a working reference standard (WRS). The current PRS 
and the current WRS are both established at 20 mg/mL and are identical with the ones used for the commercial 
large-scale process for the 20 mg/mL active substance. As the 20 mg/mL and 180 mg/mL active substance 
manufacturing  processes  only  differ  from  the  UF/DF  step  onwards,  the  PRS  is  considered  suitable  for 
efgartigimod 180 mg/mL. A new secondary WRS was established at 180 mg/mL, by aliquoting a portion of a 
clinical phase 3 efgartigimod batch that is formulated at 180 mg/mL and is representative of the commercial 
large-scale  process  for  the  180  mg/mL  active  substance.  This  new  WRS  was  characterized  and  adequately 
qualified by comparison against the current PRS.  
In conclusion, the current PRSs and WRSs are considered properly qualified and fit for purpose. The reference 
standards are requalified annually according to standard operating procedures. A strategy for introducing new 
WRS has been outlined and is considered appropriate.  
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
The applicant performed, in accordance with the ICH Q5C, a comprehensive series of stability studies for shelf-
life  determination  and  characterization  of  the  stability  profile  of  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance. 
Based on these studies, the applicant proposed a shelf-life of 24 months for efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active 
substance, at the intended storage condition. 
The  stability  studies  included  primary  PPQ  batches  (manufactured  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas)  and  supportive 
stability  batches  (manufactured  at  the  same  site).  Based  on  the  comprehensive  comparability  data,  the 
supportive batches are considered representative for the final commercial active substance and the stability 
data  generated  with  these  batches  can  be  used  for  shelf-life  determination  of  the  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL 
active substance. Furthermore, stability data from additional active substance batches manufactured according 
to  the  historical  manufacturing  processes  have  been  presented.  As  these  batches  used  a  different  final 
formulation, the results are only included for information. 
The  stability  studies  were  conducted  under  long-term  storage  condition,  accelerated  storage  conditions  and 
stressed storage conditions.  
Long-term stability data are presented for up to 24 months for the primary PPQ batches. Long-term stability 
data are presented for up to 24 months for the supportive batches. The stability data shows that the tested 
CQAs of the active substance were stable and within the shelf-life acceptance criteria and no stability trends 
were seen in the quality of the efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance when stored at long-term conditions.  
The  stress  temperature  stability  study  results  demonstrate  the  stability-indicating  properties  of  the  test 
methods. Forced degradation studies, together with the accelerated and stress temperature studies, showed 
the main degradation pathways of efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance. The applicant also evaluated the 
effect of freeze/thaw cycles on the active substance stability with 1 supportive batch. Comparable results for 
the  tested  parameters  were  obtained  for  the  samples  subjected  to  freeze/thaw  cycles  at  small  scale  and  at 
scale  containers  and  stored  for  9  months.  Since  the  applicant  demonstrated  comparability  between  active 
substance manufactured throughout process development, the supportive batch is considered representative 
and the applicant’s conclusion that there is no marked impact on the product quality of efgartigimod 180 mg/mL 
active substance for to up to 5 freeze/thaw cycles can be accepted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 19/173 
 
 
In  conclusion,  the  stability  results  indicate  that  the  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  is  sufficiently 
stable over the proposed shelf-life of 24 months when stored in the proposed container. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
The  finished  product  (efgartigimod  PH20)  is  presented  as  a  sterile,  preservative-free,  clear  to  opalescent, 
yellowish solution for subcutaneous injection. The product contains 1000 mg of efgartigimod active substance 
at  a  concentration  of  180  mg/mL  and  11200  U  of  recombinant  human  hyaluronidase  PH20  (rHuPH20)  at  a 
concentration  of  2000  U/mL,  in  a  L-histidine/L-histidine  HCl,  sodium  chloride,  sucrose,  L-methionine,  PS20 
buffer.  
The excipients are added during active substance manufacturing, except for rHuPH20 which is added during 
manufacturing of the finished product. There is no overage in the efgartigimod finished product. An 8% overfill 
is applied up to a target fill volume of 6.7 mL necessary to ensure withdrawal of at least 6.2 mL that allow for 
the delivery of the required 5.6 mL volume.  
Efgartigimod finished product contains well-known pharmaceuticals ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with Ph. Eur. standards, with the exception of rHuPH20 which is tested as per in-house specification. No novel 
excipients or excipients of human or animal origin are used in the finished product composition. Compatibility 
of the active substance with the excipients is considered demonstrated based on both active substance and 
finished product stability data.  
The rHuPH20 specification for release and stability are identical, except for tests for identity, impurities and 
safety tests which are only performed at release. A summary of the analytical procedures and validations hereof 
are included in the dossier. Justification of the release and stability acceptance criterion for each individual test 
attribute is provided and summarized. In summary, the rHuPH20 specifications, including acceptance criteria 
and analytical procedures, are considered acceptable.  
During the assessment, a Major Objection was raised for the insufficient information provided for the rHuPH20 
excipient  with  regards  to  description  of  the  manufacturing  process,  control  of  materials,  process  validation, 
characterization  of  rHuPH20,  impurity  testing,  stability  and  viral  safety  assessment.  In  its  response,  the 
applicant  clarified  that  the  rHuPH20  used  for  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product  is  of  the same  quality  and 
manufactured  by  the  same  manufacturer  as  the  rHuPH20  excipient  currently  used  in  several  already  EU-
marketed products. In addition, a statement confirming a quality agreement between rHuPH20 manufacturer 
and the manufacturer of the efgartigimod PH20 finished product has been provided, ensuring that the finished 
product  manufacturer  will  be  notified  of  any  rHuPH20  manufacturing  process  changes  that  might  affect  the 
quality of the final product. This approach is endorsed, and the major objection is considered resolved. 
Container closure system 
Efgartigimod PH20 finished product is filled into 6 mL glass vials (Ph. Eur. type I). The glass vial is stoppered 
with a rubber stopper and closed using an aluminium crimp seal equipped with a polypropylene flip-off cap. 
The materials for the primary packaging of the finished product are in line with Ph. Eur. requirements. The CCS 
is  suitable  for  the  finished  product  as  demonstrated  by  the  long-term  stability  data  and  container  closure 
integrity  (CCI)  under  the  applied  stoppering  and  capping  conditions  has  been  successfully  demonstrated 
through dye ingress testing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 20/173 
 
 
Extractables and leachables studies have been performed on the container closure components. Considering 
that the proposed finished product presentation includes the same container/closure materials specifications 
and only a slightly different formulation, the target compound selection for the leachable study was based on 
the extractable study performed for the IV formulation. A leachable screening study is ongoing to identify and 
quantify leachable compounds in batches of efgartigimod PH20 finished product. The results of the extractables 
and  ongoing  leachables  studies  (up  to  3  months  of  long-term  and  accelerated  studies)  performed  on  the 
commercial  primary  packaging  (vial  and  stopper)  configuration  for  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product 
demonstrate  that the selected CCS is  suitable for  use for the finished  product. The Applicant has confirmed 
that  leachables  studies  will  be  continued  until  60  months  at  long-term  conditions  and  until  12  months  at 
accelerated conditions. This approach is endorsed. 
In-use compatibility 
In order to deliver the finished product, the solution needs to be extracted from the vial using a syringe-needle 
combination and SC administered through a winged infusion set. An in-use compatibility/short-term stability 
study  was  performed  to  demonstrate  that  the  subcutaneous  administration  procedure  does  not  impact 
efgartigimod  PH20  product  quality  attributes  and  to  demonstrate  the  compatibility  of  efgartigimod  PH20 
solution  for  subcutaneous  injection  with  different  auxiliary  material  combinations.  No  change  in  physico-
chemical quality attributes was observed over the monitored time period of 30 hours (24 hours at 5°C plus 6 
hours at 30°C) for the finished product in syringe prior to administration. A microbial hold study was performed 
with  selected  challenge  organisms  on  the  finished  product  in  syringes  to  simulate  potential  microbial 
contamination that may occur during the preparation and storage of syringes, prior to SC administration. No 
microbial growth was observed in spiked syringes containing efgartigimod PH20 finished product. The results 
support the hold of the efgartigimod PH20 finished product in syringe, following dose preparation, for up to 24 
hours at +2°C to +8°C and for up to 2 hours (cumulatively) at ambient temperature. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The pharmaceutical development approach was based on the following elements: definition of a Quality Target 
Product  Profile  (QTPP),  identification  of  potential  Critical  Quality  Attributes  (CQAs)  of  the  finished  product, 
selection  of  the  appropriate  manufacturing  process,  determination  of  the  CQAs  of  the  active  substance, 
selection of the excipients and the container closure system, and definition of the quality control strategy. The 
QTPP includes: intended indication, mechanism of action as well as the molecule critical features impacting the 
mechanism of action, dosage form, mode of administration, dose, concentration, strength, container closure 
system, shelf-life stability and compatibility with the application devices and the manufacturing process, as well 
as the finished product quality requirements (compliance with the requirement for parenteral preparations). 
Based on the QTPP, CQAs were defined. CQAs have initially been determined for efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active 
substance  and  the  corresponding  efgartigimod  IV  finished  product.  As  the  manufacturing  process  for 
efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  is  identical  to  the  process  for  the  efgartigimod  20  mg/mL  active 
substance, up to and including the last viral reduction step, a large part of the CQA assessment for efgartigimod 
20  mg/mL  are  also  applicable  for  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL.  These  elements  were  integrated  in  the  CQA 
assessment  performed  prior  to  PPQ  for  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  and  efgartigimod  PH20 
solution for SC injection. The assessment was based on a review of all available historical quality, non-clinical 
and clinical data linked to efgartigimod product development. The proposed approach is considered acceptable.  
The  formulation  development  of  a  SC  administered  efgartigimod  finished  product  covered  6  different  high 
concentration  formulations  for  SC  administration  that  were  developed  and  used  throughout  non-clinical  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 21/173 
 
 
clinical  development.  The  formulations  differ  in  efgartigimod  concentration,  rHuPH20  concentration  and 
formulation buffer. In summary, the formulation development is considered adequately described. 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  consisting  of  mixing  rHuPH20  with 
efgartigimod active substance followed by sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping. No finished 
product process development activities were performed, but product presentation changed over time and thus 
the fill volume and vials used. Two manufacturing sites have been used during development of the finished 
product manufacture. The manufacturing processes are comparable and comparability of efgartigimod PH20 
finished product manufactured at both sites has been demonstrated. The majority of the clinical development 
activities for the efgartigimod PH20 finished product took place at the intended commercial manufacturing site, 
in accordance with the commercial manufacturing process and only 1 clinical batch was manufactured at the 
other manufacturing site.  
The development of the process control strategy was also presented by the applicant. A risk assessment was 
conducted prior and post-PPQ manufacture using a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method, which 
evaluated  the  potential  effects  that  various  process  parameters  may have  on  product  quality  attributes  and 
manufacturing  process  performance.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the  risk  assessment  exercise,  a  final 
classification of process parameters (as either CPP or non-CPP) for the PPQ campaign was performed. Overall, 
the proposed sets of process and release controls are reasonable. 
In  conclusion,  sufficient  details  regarding  the  finished  product  process  development  were  presented  by  the 
applicant. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
The efgartigimod PH20 finished product is manufactured, filled, packaged, inspected and tested in accordance 
with  GMP.  The  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product  batch  formula  has  been  provided  for  the  intended 
commercial batch size range.  
Efgartigimod PH20 finished product manufacturing process is considered standard and consists of thawing of 
the active substance, thawing of the rHuPH20 bulk enzyme, pooling and mixing of the active substance with 
rHuPH20 bulk enzyme, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping 
operations, visual inspection, sampling for analytical testing, vial labelling, secondary packaging, serialization 
and  storage.  All  process  steps  are  performed  at  room  temperature  (15°C  to  25°C),  except  thawing  of  the 
rHuPH20 bulk enzyme which is performed at 2°C to 8ºC.  
There are no reprocessing steps and no intermediates in the efgartigimod PH20 finished product manufacturing 
process. The process controls associated with the efgartigimod PH20 finished product manufacturing process 
are categorized as process parameters or as in-process controls. For each manufacturing step, a summary of 
the established process controls, their criticality (i.e. CPP or non-CPP), hold times, test methods and acceptance 
criteria are presented. The critical steps that may have a direct impact on the CQAs of the finished product are 
also listed, together with appropriate controls. 
Overall, the manufacturing process and the equipment used is considered adequately described. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 22/173 
 
 
The PPQ was performed with commercial scale batches. The process validation included hold/processing time 
challenges,  homogeneity  testing,  consistency  of  the  aseptic  operation  testing,  results  of  routine  in-process 
control testing, visual inspection, release testing. All IPCs and release data of the PPQ batches comply with the 
predefined  acceptance  criteria  and  the  release  specification,  including  the  batches  manufactured  using  the 
maximum hold and processing times.  
An overview and a summary of the performance qualification for the key equipment used for manufacture of 
efgartigimod finished product is presented. Aseptic manufacturing is regularly confirmed by media fills (at least 
twice a year) and results of the most recent media fills show that the pre-defined acceptance criteria are met. 
The aseptic filling process, representative of the finished product manufacturing process, is documented to be 
validated for a maximum filling duration of 24 hours. The validation of the sterile filtration demonstrated that 
the  process  consistently  provided  a  sterile  solution  and  that  the  risk  for  patients  treated  with  efgartigimod 
finished product due to extractables from the filter devices used for filtering the finished product is negligible. 
Shipping  studies  were  performed,  and  results  confirm  that  the  shipping  containers  are  able  to  maintain  the 
integrity of the efgartigimod product package following exaggerated physical stress.  
Continued process verification (CPV) is conducted during the entire life cycle of the product. 
In conclusion, the efgartigimod PH20 finished product manufacturing process has been validated. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The  proposed  release  specification  for  the  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product  includes  tests  for  visual 
appearance (colour, clarity and visible particles), osmolality, extractable volume, sub-visible particles, protein 
concentration,  pH,  identity,  identity  rHuPH20,  potency,  purity,  PS20  concentration,  rHUPH20  activity  and 
safety. The same parameters are tested during shelf-life, except for extractable volume, identity and identity 
rHuPH20. No widening of the finished product release criteria was considered for stability studies.  
Most of the test parameters and acceptance criteria proposed for the control of the finished product are identical 
with the tests and acceptance criteria applied for the 180 mg/mL active substance. As for the active substance, 
acceptance  limits  for  potency,  purity  and  endotoxin  have  been  tightened  upon  request  to  be  aligned  with 
acceptance limits approved for efgartigimod IV finished product, except for one purity parameter. The proposed 
limit is supported by clinical data and is considered acceptable. In addition, the endotoxin limit is slightly higher 
in  case  of  the  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product  compared  to  the  acceptance  criteria  applied  for  the  180 
mg/mL active substance, which is justified by the need to account for addition of recombinant rHuPH20 during 
the finished product manufacture.  
No  new  impurities/degradation  products  are  formed  during  the  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product 
manufacturing process compared to the active substance.  
Elemental  impurities  were  evaluated  according  to  ICH  Q3D  guideline.  Based  on  the  risk  assessment  for  the 
efgartigimod active substance, excipients, rHuPH20 bulk enzyme, container closure system and the results of 
elemental impurities analysis on representative finished product batches, it is concluded that the overall risk of 
a potential release of elemental impurities into the efgartigimod PH20 finished product is low. Therefore, it can 
be  concluded  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  include  any  elemental  impurity  controls  in  the  finished  product 
specification. This conclusion is supported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 23/173 
 
 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed 
considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and  answers  for  marketing 
authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004 
referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/409815/2020)  and  the  “Assessment 
report  -  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No)  726/2004  -  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that no risk was 
identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related  finished 
product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
Overall, the parameters included in the efgartigimod PH20 finished product specification are found adequate to 
control the quality of the product at release and shelf-life. Justification of specification is based on historical 
data, data on process qualification batches and post-PPQ batches.  
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods)  appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The methods are the same as those used to test efgartigimod 180 
mg/mL active substance, except for tests for osmolality, extractable volume, visible and sub-visible particles, 
rHuPH20  identity  and  enzyme  activity  and  safety,  which  are  product-specific  assays.  Tests  for  appearance, 
protein concentration, pH, identity, potency, purity and PS20 concentration are also performed on the active 
substance.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data are presented for PPQ and post-PPQ batches. The batch data presented complies with the 
finished  product  specification  and  demonstrates  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process.  In  addition, 
supportive historical batch data has been provided. 
Reference materials 
The efgartigimod reference standard used for analytical testing of efgartigimod PH20 finished product is the 
same as used for analytical testing of efgartigimod active substance. Reference is made to the active substance 
section on Reference materials. 
For the rHuPH20 standard (Assay Reference Standard - ARS), used for analytical testing of efgartigimod PH20 
finished  product,  a  two-tiered  reference  standard  strategy  consisting  of  an  established  PRS  and  a  WRS  has 
been  implemented.  The  current  ARS  was  established  as  both  PRS  and  WRS.  Upon  depletion  of  the  working 
reference standard aliquots, a replacement working reference standard will be calibrated and qualified against 
the  respective  established  primary  reference  standard.  The  current  ARS  was  generated  from  a  rHuPH20  BE 
(bulk  enzyme)  batch  that  met  all  release  specifications,  as  well  as  tighter  selection  acceptance  criteria  for 
protein concentration and specific activity (potency). Additional characterization testing was performed. The 
characterization assays, acceptance criteria and results obtained for rHuPH20 BE source batch are specified. In 
summary, the current primary and initial working ARS lot is considered qualified for use in the rHuPH20 enzyme 
activity assay. The reference standard is re-evaluated on an annual basis in accordance with an established 
quality system.  
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The  applicant  is  proposing  a  shelf-life  of  18  months  at  5°C  ±  3°C  for  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product. 
Stability  studies  were  performed  on  3  primary  PPQ  batches,  supportive  batches  and  additional  batches, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 24/173 
 
 
following  storage  at  5°C  ±  3°C  (long-term  storage  condition),  25°C  ±  2°C/60  ±  5%  relative  humidity 
(accelerated storage condition) and 40°C ± 2°C/75 ± 5% relative humidity (stressed storage condition). The 
primary  stability  batches  were  manufactured  at  the  proposed  commercial  site,  using  PPQ  active  substance 
batches. Supportive batches were manufactured at both clinical manufacturing sites. Based on both the active 
substance and finished product comparability packages, these non-PPQ batches are considered representative 
for  the  final  commercial  finished  product  and  the  stability  data  can  be  considered  supportive  for  shelf-life 
determination. The additional finished product batches have not been considered for shelf-life determination 
since  they  had  a  different  final  formulation  and/or  since  the  active  substance  was  manufactured  at  Lonza 
Biologics,  Slough  and  not  at  the  commercial  site  (Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas).  Therefore,  stability  data  for  these 
batches is presented for information only.  
The stability testing program was performed in accordance with the ICH guideline Q5C, using adequate test 
intervals, stability-indicating methods and representative CCS. Available long-term stability data from primary 
batches showed that the tested CQAs of the finished product were stable and within the shelf-life acceptance 
criteria over an 18 months time period under long-term storage condition. This was also supported by either 
18 or 24 months of stability data from supportive batches, which demonstrated a comparable and stable profile 
of the finished product within the tested time period.  
Based on the data generated from the accelerated and stress studies, the primary degradation pathways of the 
efgartigimod PH20 finished product were identified and the methods used were demonstrated to be stability-
indicating.  The  photosensitivity  of  the  finished  product  was  performed  on  a  PPQ  batch  placed  into  a 
photostability study performed in accordance with the ICH Q1B guideline. The photostability data indicate that 
the  finished  product  complies  with  the  current  acceptance  criteria  when  kept  in  the  proposed  secondary 
packaging configuration. Based on the results obtained for the fully exposed (primary packed) vials, it can be 
concluded that efgartigimod vials must be stored in their outer cartons.   
In summary, based on available stability data, the shelf-life of efgartigimod PH20 finished product of 18 months 
and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the 
original package in order to protect from light) are acceptable.  
In addition, for the unopened vials, the following storage condition is proposed in the SmPC and is considered 
justified by the in-use compatibility studies: If needed, unopened vials may be stored at room temperature (up 
to 30 °C)  for  up  to  3 days.  After  storage  at  room  temperature,  unopened  vials  may  be  returned  to  the 
refrigerator. If stored out of and then returned to refrigeration, the total combined time out of refrigeration 
should  not  exceed  3  days.  From  a  microbial  point  of  view,  unless  the  method  of  preparation  of  the  syringe 
precludes the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents 
No  animal  or  human-derived  raw  materials  were  used  during  generation  of the  efgartigimod  production  cell 
line or establishment and storage of MCBs and WCBs or during the manufacturing process of the efgartigimod 
active  substance.  Reference  is  made  to  Section  3.2.S.2.3  Control  of  Materials  for  previously  authorized 
efgartigimod 20 mg/mL active substance.  
During routine manufacture, appropriate measures are in place for controlling the risk of contamination with 
non-viral adventitious agents, including testing and control of raw materials, testing of EOPC at the limit of in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023

vitro cell age (LIVCA), the facilities and equipment used, filtration of process solutions through sterilizing grade 
filters  prior  to  use  and  performing  in-process  controls  for  bioburden,  endotoxin  and  mycoplasma/fungi.  In 
addition, the efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance and the efgartigimod PH20 finished product are tested 
for endotoxin level and absence of fungi and bacteria at release and during shelf-life, using compendial methods 
(Ph. Eur.).  
Based  on  the  information  provided,  the  risk  of  BSE/TSE  (Bovine  Spongiform  Encephalopathy/Transmissible 
Spongiform  Encephalopathy)  contamination  of  efgartigimod  PH20  finished  product  during  manufacturing  is 
considered negligible.  
Viral adventitious agents 
The purification process used at Lonza Biologics, Tuas for the manufacture of 180 mg/mL active substance is 
the same as the process for the 20 mg/mL active substance, up to and including the last virus reduction step. 
Therefore, the viral clearance studies described for the efgartigimod IV finished product are also applicable to 
the  efgartigimod  180  mg/mL  active  substance  and  SC  finished  product.  Therefore,  reference  is  made  to 
Sections  3.2.A.2  Adventitious  Agents  Safety  Evaluation  and  3.2.R.2  Viral  Safety  Package  for  the  previously 
authorized efgartigimod IV finished product.  
During  the  efgartigimod  manufacturing  process,  samples  are  taken  to  monitor  and  demonstrate  control  of 
adventitious  viral  agents  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5A  guideline.  In-process  controls  are  performed  on 
unprocessed  active  substance  bulk  samples  taken  on  the  day  of  harvest.  No  adventitious  viral  agents  have 
been detected in the unprocessed bulk for any batches of efgartigimod 180 mg/mL active substance.  
The  cumulative  reduction  factors  for  the  20  mg/mL  process  at  Lonza  Biologics,  Tuas  have  been  used  to 
determine the retrovirus-like particles per dose and safety margin data for the 180 mg/mL active substance. 
The results demonstrate a low and acceptable risk. 
The  viral  safety  data  provided  by  the  applicant  for  raw  materials  of  biological  origin,  cell  bank  testing,  bulk 
harvest testing, virus clearance validation studies and retroviral risk assessment is considered acceptable. 
rHuPH20 
An adventitious agents safety evaluation for the rHuPH20 bulk enzyme is also presented by the applicant. The 
BSE/TSE risk is considered negligible, based on that fact that no animal or human-derived materials are used 
during  generation  of  the  production  cell  line  or  establishment  and  storage  of  MCBs  and  WCBs  or  the 
manufacturing process of rHuPH20 excipient, except for the media used for the manufacture of a process aid 
used  to  convert  the  insulin  to  the  active  form  that  contains  two  bovine  derived  components,  amicase  and 
lactose. As these components are derived from healthy animals and are exposed to a thermal treatment, they 
comply with the “Note for guidance on minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy 
agents  by  a  human  or  veterinary  medicinal  products”  (EMA/410/01  rev.  3)  and  pose  no  risk  to  the  patient 
safety. In addition, this process aid is removed in the subsequent purification and isolation steps in the insulin 
manufacturing process. 
Moreover, the cell banks and manufacturing process for the excipient rHuPH20 enzyme are tested for presence 
of viruses. The process contains orthogonal viral clearance steps which were challenged with 4 model viruses. 
A viral safety risk assessment was performed demonstrating robust viral clearance and provides assurance of 
viral safety for the excipient rHuPH20 enzyme.  
Overall,  the  information  presented  for  the  BSE/TSE  and  viral  safety  evaluation  for  rHuPH20  is  considered 
acceptable.

2.3.3.6.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
A Major Objection was raised during the assessment for the insufficient information submitted for the rHuPH20 
non-compendial biological excipient, which has been adequately addressed by the applicant by the end of the 
procedure. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
The mode of action was already well described in the initial marketing authorisation application (MAA) for IV 
administration. In the present extension application, an additional study exploring the effects of efgartigimod 
on  the  PD  drug  interactions  of  efgartigimod  with  IVIg  and  a  tracer  antibody,  in  Tg32  mice.  No  specific 
pharmacology studies were performed using the SC route of administration. 
In brief, the mode of action represents a rational therapeutic approach in autoimmune diseases mediated by 
IgG autoantibodies. The proposed indication for efgartigimod PH20 SC is the treatment of adult patients with 
gMG. Nonclinical pharmacology studies have shown that efgartigimod binds to FcRn, reduces concentrations of 
IgG in the circulation including pathogenic autoantibodies and reduces signs of disease in animal models. The 
mode of action of efgartigimod (saturation of FcRn and linked enhanced clearance of pathogenic IgG) avoids 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 27/173 
 
 
suppression of T- and B-cell activity and preserves IgM and IgA levels because homeostasis of those Ig classes 
does not rely on FcRn. In addition, efgartigimod does not affect serum albumin concentrations, because it does 
not interfere with the albumin-FcRn interaction. 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
A  new  PD  drug  interaction  study  was  submitted,  which  investigated  the  effect  of  IVIg  and  efgartigimod 
treatment. It was shown that efgartigimod levels following an IV dose of 20 mg/kg were not influenced by IVIg 
after  coadministration  regardless  of  the  treatment  scheme.  In  reverse,  efgartigimod  reduced  but  did  not 
eliminate levels of IVIg measured as total IgG. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Only two studies in cynomolgus monkeys were performed with SC administration of efgartigimod, one single 
dose  pharmacokinetics  (PK)/PD  study,  and  a  12-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  bridging  study.  Furthermore, 
pharmacokinetics was (re)calculated using a noncompartmental PK/PD model.  
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation After Single Dose of Efgartigimod SC in Cynomolgus Monkey (Study No 
ARGX-NC-092) 
The  PK  and  PD  effects  after  a  single  SC  dose  of  efgartigimod  20  mg/kg  (without  recombinant  human 
hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)) were evaluated. Cynomolgus monkeys were treated with a single 20 mg/kg 
SC  injection  or  a  single  20  mg/kg  IV  infusion  of  efgartigimod.  After  SC  administration,  peak  concentrations 
were  reached  after  24  to  48  hours  and  were  approximately  10-fold  lower  as  compared  to  after  IV

(Figure 1).

Based on the shape of the PK profile, a dominant or effective elimination half-life (t½,eff) and terminal elimination 
half-life (t½,z) were apparent. After SC injection, a t½,eff of 46.2 hours was estimated based on the sampling 
time points from 24 hours up to 168 hours or 240 hours postdose. The t½,z of 160 hours was estimated based 
on the terminal portion of the curve. AUC0-168h represented approximately 80% of area under the concentration-

time  curve  from  time  zero  to  infinity  (AUC0-inf)  supporting  the  relatively  small  contribution  of  the  terminal 
elimination phase to the total exposure. Therefore, t½,eff is considered to be more relevant for the elimination 
and  accumulation  of  efgartigimod.  Similar  observations  were  made  as  after  IV  administration.  Compared  to 
after  efgartigimod  IV  20  mg/kg,  the  bioavailability  of  efgartigimod  SC  20  mg/kg  (without  rHuPH20)  was 
estimated to be approximately 50% (Table 1).

Pharmacokinetic Evaluation After 12-Weekly SC Injections in Male and Female Cynomolgus Monkey 
In this GLP-compliant 12-week repeat-dose toxicity study with weekly SC doses of efgartigimod 30 and 100 
mg/kg  comixed  with  2000  U/mL  rHuPH20  and  efgartigimod  100  mg/kg  without  rHuPH20  in  cynomolgus 
monkey. 
Serum samples were taken predose and at 8, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours postdose after the first and the last 
dose. At all other dosing days, a predose and a 24-hour post dose sample were taken. 
After SC administration of efgartigimod 30 or 100 mg/kg comixed with 2000 U/mL rHuPH20, the PK evaluation 
revealed a dose-related increase in Cmax and AUC0-144h after the first and last dose. The dose proportion factor 
ranged  from  0.78  to  1.03.  No  sex-specific  differences  were  observed  and  no  substantial  accumulation  was 
noted. 
rHuPH20 appeared to have minimal effect on the multiple dose PK of efgartigimod. After the last SC dose of 
efgartigimod 100 mg/kg comixed with 2000 U/mL rHuPH20, in both males and females, mean time of maximum 
observed concentration (tmax) was reached between 8 to 24 hours. Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) 
and AUC0-144h were 585/402 μg/mL and 34 030/22 182 μg.h/mL in males/females, respectively. After the last 
SC  dose  of  efgartigimod  100  mg/kg  without  rHuPH20,  in  both  males  and  females,  mean  tmax  was  reached 
between 8 to 16 hours. Cmax and AUC0-144h were 377/378 μg/mL and 25 143/19 973 μg.h/mL in males/females, 
respectively.

b DPF calculated relative to 30 mg/kg efgartigimod SC comixed with rHuPH20 
In  summary,  the  following  important  PK  characteristics  of  efgartigimod  as  assessed  after  IV  administration 
were confirmed after SC administration: dose-proportional increase in Cmax and AUC with comparable DPFs for 
both sexes and a lack of accumulation over time was corroborated. 
A translational PK/PD model (study 20 021 TPKPD) was developed to describe the efgartigimod serum PK profile 
(without  rHuPH20)  and  its  effect  on  total  IgG  concentrations  through  pH  7.4  FcRn  target  binding  in  healthy 
subjects, cynomolgus monkeys (IV/SC), rabbits (IV), rats (IV) and mice (IV). In the model, reduction of total 
IgG was linked to receptor occupancy after IV administration, which could subsequently be used to postulate 
serum concentrations after SC administration, assuming linear PK behaviour and a bioavailability of 50% after 
SC administration. Lower receptor occupancy (RO) (91.4%) after SC administration in cynomolgus monkeys is 
predicted  based  on  the  model  compared  to  97%  RO  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  after  IV  administration  of  100 
mg/kg/day.

2.4.4.  Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The  26-week  study,  described  in  the  nonclinical  overview  as  the  most  relevant  for  assessing  toxicity  of 
efgartigimod was already submitted and evaluated in the initial MAA, and will not be presented in detail in this 
round. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) from this study was 100 mg/kg once every 7 days / 
weekly (q7d), and this was used as the high dose level in the bridging study performed with SC administration 
of efgartigimod.  
A 12-week bridging study, where cynomolgus monkeys were administered efgartigimod SC with or without the 
absorption enhancer rHuPH20 administered q7d was performed. This study is presented and discussed in the 
current assessment. No significant new toxicity was observed compared to the previously performed studies 
where  the  intravenous  route  of  administration  was  used.  Local  signs  of  intolerance  were  noted  in  form  of  a 
swelling in the animals treated with 100 mg efgartigimod /kg b.w. with 2000 U/mL rHuPH20 and in form of 
haematoma,  swelling  and/or  oedema  in  the  animals  treated  with  100  mg  efgartigimod  /kg  b.w.  alone.  The 
NOAEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg efgartigimod with or without 2000 U/mL rHuPH20.  
No clinical pathology assessment examining the expected pharmacological effect of reduced IgGs was included. 
This  would  have  been  relevant,  especially  considering  that  rHuPH20  was  not  part  of  the  formulation  in  the 
PK/PD study (ARGX-NC-092) comparing PD and PK of IV or SC administered efgartigimod. However, as the TK 
measurements  show  systemic  exposure  of  efgartigimod,  the  lack  of  any  indication  on  PD  effect  can  be 
considered acceptable.   
2.4.4.2.  Toxicokinetic data 
The Cmax-levels and AUC-areas for efgartigimod revealed a roughly linear dose-related exposure of the animals 
to efgartigimod on test days 1 to 7 (i.e. 144 hours after the first administration), and 85 to 91 (i.e. 144 hours 
after the last administration). No sex-specific differences were noted. No accumulation with time was noted. 
The addition of 2000 U/mL rHuPH20 gave rise to an apparent higher Cmax and AUC, compared to SC formulation 
without this addition. 
The exposure margins calculated using the AUC and Cmax form the 26-week IV study in cynomolgus monkeys, 
gave rise to exposure multiples of 5- and 52-fold respectively, when compared to clinical exposure following 
subcutaneously administered efgartigimod 1000 mg. These are considered sufficient and are reflected in the 
SmPC section 5.3. 
2.4.4.3.  Local tolerance  
A stand-alone local tolerance study in rabbits showed no specific test item related differences between Vyvgart 
SC  formulation  or  vehicle  administered  alone  (rHuPH20).  Subcutaneously  1.0  ml  was  injected,  and 
intramuscularly 0.25 ml was administered.

A high number of anti-drug antibody (ADA’s) were observed following SC administration of efgartigimod with 
or without rHuPH20. The exposure of the animals did not appear to be affected.

ADA=Anti-Drug antibody; SC=subcutaneous; F=Female; M=Male; q7d=once weekly; NA=Not analyzed. 
Note No ADA samples were taken during the recovery period. 2000 U/ml rHuPH20 was used.  
Immunotoxicity 
A transitory reduction in anti-KLH specific IgG antibody response as well as in total IgG titers were observed in 
animals administered 100 mg/kg efgartigimod q7d. The findings resolved by the end of the recovery period. It 
was also found that administration of efgartigimod had no impact of the ability of PBMCs to respond to KLH 
antigen recall as confirmed by secretion of IFN-γ in ELISpot assays.  
The following is already included in SmPC: The potential interaction with vaccines was studied in a nonclinical 
model  using  Keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  (KLH)  as  the  antigen.  The  weekly  administration  of  100  mg/kg  to 
monkeys  did  not  impact  the  immune  response  to  KLH  immunisation.  Nevertheless,  all  vaccines  should  be 
administered according to immunisation guidelines and at least 4 weeks before initiation of a treatment cycle 
and not until 2 weeks after the last infusion of a treatment cycle. For patients that are on treatment, vaccination 
with live or live attenuated vaccines is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Efgartigimod  alfa  is  a  recombinant  protein  and,  due  to  the  nature  of  the  product,  is  unlikely  to  result  in 
significant risk to the environment. As per the EMA Guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, Section 2, the 
MAH did not submit environmental risk assessment studies.  
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A brief number of studies were submitted in support of this line extension to include SC administration. A new 
PD  study  was  submitted,  which  investigated  the  interaction  between  IV  administered  efgartigimod  and  IVIg 
treatment  in  Tg32  mice.    Furthermore,  a  PD/PK  study  in  male  cynomolgus  monkeys  examined  the 
pharmacokinetic properties after SC or IV administration of 30 or 100 mg/kg efgartigimod (without inclusion 
of rHuPH20).  
Two new nonclinical toxicity studies were submitted, one 12-week repeat dose bridging study in cynomolgus 
monkeys, and a local tolerance study in rabbits. Neither study revealed any pertinent concerns regarding the 
SC formulation of efgartigimod. In addition, the TDAR evaluation was extensively presented and discussed by 
Assessment report

the MAH, but the study had actually been submitted, and the relevant information already included in the SmPC 
(Section 4.4) since MAA approval for the IV route of administration. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, efgartigimod SC is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the provided brief newly submitted nonclinical study package, supported by the knowledge from the 
initial MAA including IV administration of efgartigimod can be considered sufficient to support the line extension 
for efgartigimod SC.  
2.5.  Clinical aspects

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Efgartigimod alfa is a IgG1-derived Fc fragment produced by recombinant DNA technology. Efgartigimod alfa 
is  engineered  for  increased  affinity  to  the  FcRn,  resulting  in  the  reduction  of  the  levels  of  circulating  IgG 
including autoantibodies. Efgartigimod alfa has been developed for treatment of adult patients with gMG. The 
molecular weight of efgartigimod alfa is approximately 54 kDa. 
The MAH has been granted a marketing authorisation for efgartigimod as an IV product, and the present line 
extension concerns a fixed dose of 1000 mg efgartigimod coformulated with the permeation enhancer rHuPH20 
(2000 U/mL) for SC administration. The proposed posology is 1000 mg efgartigimod once weekly for four weeks 
with subsequent treatment cycles according to clinical evaluation, the same administration regimen as with IV 
administration. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  has  been  studied  in  both  healthy  participants  (studies 
ARGX-113-1901  and  ARGX-113-1907)  and  participants  with  gMG  (studies  ARGX-113-2001  and  ARGX-113-
2002). 
Analytical methods 
Ten clinical bioanalytical reports were submitted with this extension and covered quantification of efgartigimod 
in  study  2001,  1907  and  1901,  determination  of  PD  markers  in  studies  2001,  1907,  1901,  1704  and  1705, 
detection of efgartigimod ADAs in study 2001, 1907 and 1901, rHuPH20 ADAs in study 2001, 1907 and rHuPH20 
neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in study 2001. 
Several  validated  analytical  methods  were  employed  for  quantification  of  efgartigimod,  for  detection  of  PD 
markers and for assessment of immunogenicity of efgartigimod and of rHuPH20.  
Population PK (popPK) analyses including Study 2001 
The  popPK  model  for  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  was  based  on  a  3-compartment  PK  model  submitted  for  the 
approved IV treatment. This model contained the assumption that volume of peripheral components (V2 = V3) 
and interindividual variability (IIV) was included on clearance (CL), volume of central compartment (V1), V2/V3, 
first order absorption rate (Ka) and CLxV1 covariance. The model structure is shown in figure below. The PopPK 
included data from healthy subjects (ARGX-113-1501, ARGX-113-1702 (IV data only), ARGX-113-1901, ARGX-
113-1907)  and  gMG  patients  (ARGX-113-1602  and  ARGX-113-1704)  after  either  efgartigimod  IV  or 
efgartigimod  PH20  SC  treatment.  Absorption  following  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  administration  was  modelled 
using a sequential zero-first order absorption model with a short or a long duration of the zero-order absorption.

Figure 2: Schematic representation of the PK model for efgartigimod  
Schematic representation of the PK model for efgartigimod. A three-compartmental model was used to describe the PK of efgartigimod. It was 
assumed  that  the  volumes  of  the  two  peripheral  compartments  were  the  same,  i.e.  V2=V3.  CL=clearance  of  efgartigimod;  V1:  volume  of 
central compartment: Q2 and Q3: inter-compartmental flow; V2=V3 volume of peripheral compartments; DUR: duration of the zero-order 
absorption; KA: first-order abs rate.  
The  previous  model  was  updated  with  data  from  study  ARGX-113-2001  with  re-estimation  of  parameters. 
Significant covariates were: body weight on CL, V1 and V2/V3, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on 
CL and sex on V1. The final parameters were estimated with adequate precision (%RSE).  Eta shrinkage was 
<20% except for Ka (36%) and V2/V3 (36.9%). 
The final model was evaluated by goodness of fit (GoF) plots and prediction corrected visual predictive checks 
(pcVPCs). pcVPCs for Study 2001 (IV and SC) are displayed in figures below.

PK/total IgG model including Study 2001 
The  existing  PK/total  IgG  model  including  data  from  studies  1501,  1602,  1702,  1704,  1901  and  1907  was 
updated  with  data  from  Study  2001.  The  model  structure  was  an  indirect  response  model  with  an  effect 
compartment to describe the time delay between efgartigimod concentrations and the reduction of total lgG 
concentrations.  See  Figure  below  IIV  was  included  for  baseline,  concentration  in  the  effect  compartment 
providing half of the maximum effect (EC50), degradation rate (kout) and first-order delay rate constant (keo), 
and a proportional error model for the residuals. Covariance was found between EC50 and kout, and between 
EC50and keo. The significant covariates identified in the updated model were IVMG on EC50, co-medication on 
baseline and population type on kout.

collected in seropositive and in seronegative gMG patients from IV studies 1602 (n=12) and 1704 (n=84), was

estimated, however, parameters and effects that came from the final PK/total IgG model were fixed. The model 
assumes that AChRAb is a subset of total lgG. IIV was only estimated for baseline binding AChRAb and the 
scaling parameter α.  
The scaling parameter which describes the reduction in AChRAb as a function of the reduction in total lgG, was 
close to 1 in the final model (α=0.994). Covariate effects included was population (IV gMG) on EC50, population 
(gMG) on kout and co-medication on baseline. Covariate effects were all fixed and came from the final PK/total 
IgG model and were thus related to the total IgG data. 
The final PK/total IgG/binding AChRAb model (C.AChRAb.mod) was evaluated by GoF plots and VPC’s which 
indicated  the  model  could  describe  the  AChRAb  observations  in  seropositive  subjects  from  Study  2001.  The 
PK/total  lgG/binding  AChRAb  model  was  also  applied  to  the  binding  AChRAb  observations  in  seropositive 
patients  from  Study  2002.  Here  underprediction  was  visible  for  AChRAb  concentrations  approximately  at 
TAD<1500 h, most pronounced in subjects rolling over from Study 1705. VPCs for Study 2001 (SC) and Study 
2002 are shown in Figures below).

MG-ADL score model including Study 2001 
A bounded integer model for MG-ADL score with data from studies 1602, 1704 and 1705 (all IV dosed) was 
updated with MG-ADL score from study ARGX-113-2001 (IV and SC dosed) (B.MGADL.mod). The MG-ADL score 
data was collected in the first 8 weeks of a treatment cycle in both seropositive and in seronegative patients. 
The model included IIV on baseline and drug effect parameter α. The final PK/total lgG/binding AChRAb model 
was used to predict the binding AChRAb concentrations as a measure of drug effect at the time-points for MG-
ADL scoring.  
The responder rates for AChRAb seropositive patients in ARGX-113-2001 predicted by pre-final MG-ADL score 
model were in line with the observed. The VPC for SC patients of Study 2001 is shown below.

Figures  below),  except  for  the  baseline  levels  per  cycle,  suggested  to  be  due  to  the  different  re-treatment 
criteria in that study as compared to ARGX-113-1704 and ARGX-113-1705.

In the MG-ADL total score model, the reduction in total IgG was directly linked to the reduction of AChR-Ab, 
which is linked to the MG-ADL response. This model also included data from 57 AChR-Ab seronegative gMG 
patients.  The  population  MG-ADL  total  score  model  was  updated  by  excluding  all  AChR-Ab  seronegative 
participants.  
VPCs of MG-ADL total score in seropositive patients from Study 2001 following 100 mg SC dosing based on the 
first model and on the updated model are shown in Figure below for comparison.

Absorption  
As efgartigimod is a therapeutic protein, no dedicated absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion study 
was performed. Based on popPK modelling, the estimated bioavailability after SC administration is 76.5%. 
Concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctrough) data observed in the target population dosed with the 
intended 1000 mg SC (study 2001) are presented in Figure 19, and a comparison of exposure (Ctrough) in healthy 
subjects and patients with gMG is presented in Figure 20. In patients with gMG, after each administration of 
efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg, median Ctrough was 50% to 60% higher as compared to efgartigimod IV 10 
mg/kg. 
Based on popPK modelling, the median Cmax and tmax after the fourth administration of efgartigimod SC are 48 
µg/mL and 48 hours, respectively.

The AChR-Ab serotype (seropositive or seronegative) had no effect on the Ctrough of efgartigimod PH20 SC. 
Distribution 
Based on popPK data, the volume of distribution following subcutaneous efgartigimod is approximately 18 L. 
Elimination 
The  route  of  elimination  has  been  described  in  the  original  IV  application.  Once  systemically  absorbed,  the 
elimination is the same regardless of the route of administration. In healthy participants, median values were 
comparable between both treatments and were 78.7 and 82.7 hours for efgartigimod IV and efgartigimod PH20 
SC, respectively.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality has not been assessed after multiple SC dosing. After single SC doses of 750 to 1750 mg 
efgartigimod, a trend of more than dose-proportional increase in exposure with increasing SC doses cannot be 
excluded. However, the analyses are based on little data (n=8 in each dose group), so no conclusion can be 
made.  
Based on the evaluation of Ctrough, the accumulation of efgartigimod after the fourth administration compared 
to after the first administration of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg was minimal (Figure 19). Also, in subsequent 
cycles, the PK of efgartigimod did not change over time supported by consistent values of Ctrough across the 
different cycles. 
Inter-individual variability 
After  4  weekly  administrations  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  1000  mg  in  healthy  participants,  the  intersubject 
variability  in  efgartigimod  PK  in  %CV  for  Cmax  and  AUC0-168h  was  42.3%  and  25.8%,  respectively.  In  the 
population PK analysis on data from sparse sampling in phase 3 studies, the variability on the final PK model 
parameters CL, V1, and V2/V3 were moderate (ie, 19.5%, 34.0%, and 18.7%, respectively). 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
In  a  categorical  evaluation,  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment  (eGFR  ≥60  to  <90  mL/min/1.73  m2)  were 
estimated to show a 11% (90% CI: 3% to 19%) higher AUC0-168h, compared to patients with normal renal 
function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Figure 21). After 10 000 simulated replicates of the dataset, taking into 
account the underlying IIV and parameter uncertainty, the median, the 5th and 95th percentile of the 10 000 
ratios with their 90% confidence interval (CI) were estimated to be 1.14 (90% CI: 1.03 to 1.25), 1.02 (90% 
CI: 0.92 to 1.12) and 1.28 (90% CI: 1.15 to 1.41) higher, respectively.

Impaired hepatic function 
No participants with gMG and hepatic impairment have been studied. Therefore, no clinical data in participants 
with hepatic impairment are available, and the impact of hepatic impairment on the PK and PD of efgartigimod 
has not been studied. However, markers of hepatic function were evaluated as potential covariates in the pop 
PK/PD  analysis.  Albumin,  total  bilirubin,  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP),  and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) did not influence any of the model parameters in the final population PK/PD 
model. 
Gender 
After simulations of 4 weekly administrations of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg, based on the dataset of ARGX-
113-2001, the median and 90% CI of the AUC0-168h ratio for female compared to male patients was 1.02 (0.95 
to 1.11). After 10 000 simulated replicates of the dataset, taking into account the underlying IIV and parameter 
uncertainty, the median, the 5th and 95th percentile of the 10 000 ratios with their 90% CI were estimated to 
be 1.10 (1.0 to 1.20), 0.98 (0.89 to 1.08) and 1.23 (1.11 to 1.35) higher, respectively.

Evaluations to assess the effect of body weight on the exposure of efgartigimod PH20 SC are discussed below. 
The results of all analyses indicate that the effect of body weight on the exposure of efgartigimod is limited and 
not clinically relevant. 
Based on the final popPK model, the AUC0-168h after the fourth administration of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg 
was simulated for a participant with the 5th and 95th percentile body weight (50.4 and 112.1 kg, respectively). 
The influence of body weight on efgartigimod exposure after administration of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg 
was limited with the simulated fold change in AUC0-168h relative to the median body weight of 78.3 kg within the 
bioequivalence boundaries of 0.8 to 1.25 (1.23- and 0.85-fold change for the 5th and 95th percentile participant, 
respectively). 
The  PK  after  the  fixed  dosing  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  was  also  compared  to  the  weight-based  dosing  of 
efgartigimod IV. Efgartigimod Ctrough observed in participants with gMG in study ARGX-113-2001 and AUC0-168h 
observed in healthy participants in study ARGX-113-1907 after 4-weekly administrations of efgartigimod PH20 
SC 1000 mg and efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg were evaluated in function of body weight (Figure 22). Despite the 
limited weight range in study ARGX-113-1907, similar trends for AUC0-168h as for Ctrough in study ARGX-113-
2001  were  observed.  After  administration  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  1000  mg,  there  was  a  trend  toward  a 
decrease in efgartigimod exposure with increasing body weight while after administration of efgartigimod IV 
10 mg/kg, the opposite trend was observed.

Individual efgartigimod AUC0-168h after the fourth dose of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg and efgartigimod 
IV 10 mg/kg were predicted based on the post hoc estimates of the population PK model. Efgartigimod AUC0-
168h was investigated for 3 body weight groups: <60 kg, ≥60 kg to <90 kg, and ≥90 kg. Geometric mean 
ratios  and  90%  CI  for  AUC0-168h  after  administration  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  1000  mg  in  a  specific  body 
weight  group  were  calculated  using  administration  of  efgartigimod  IV  10  mg/kg  in  participants  with  body 
weights ≥60 kg and <90 kg as a reference. The forest plot shows that the AUC0-168h was consistent across 
the different body weight groups after administration of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg. The 90% CI of the 
GMRs all fell within the bioequivalence limits of 0.8 to 1.25 and are not clinically relevant (Figure 23).

observed after administration of weight-based dosing of efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg. 
Race 
Of the 55 participants with gMG included in study ARGX-113-2001 receiving efgartigimod PH20 SC, the most 
common race category was white (90.9%). All Asian participants were Japanese (7.3%). The effect of race and 
ethnicity on efgartigimod PK and PD was assessed in the population PK/PD analysis. Race and ethnicity were 
not found to influence any of the model parameters of the final population PK/PD model. 
Age 
The median (min, max) age for participants with gMG receiving efgartigimod PH20 SC in study ARGX-113-2001 
was 53 (19, 84), with the majority of patients (78.2%) in the 18 to <65 years age category. The effect of age 
on efgartigimod PK and PD was assessed in the population PK/PD analysis. Age was not found to influence any 
of the model parameters of the final population PK/PD model. 
An overview of the elderly subjects who received at least one injection of efgartigimod PH20 SC is provided

Overall, the PK in special populations receiving the SC regimen is comparable to the PK after IV administration. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies have been conducted. The effect of concomitant MG treatment 
of  steroids  and/or  NSIDs  was  evaluated  by  means  of  covariate  testing  in  the  population  PK/PD  analysis. 
Participants with gMG on steroids (with or without NSIDs), appeared to have 13.6% lower baseline levels of 
total IgG, this is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Due to its mode of action, efgartigimod is expected to affect the PK and/or PD of compounds that bind to the 
human  FcRn,  ie,  immunoglobulin  products,  monoclonal  antibodies,  or  antibody  derivatives  containing  the 
human Fc domain of the IgG subclass but not IgA, IgD, IgE, or IgM. 
Immunogenicity 
In the pivotal study in participants with gMG, ARGX-113-2001, the incidence of ADA against efgartigimod was 
34.5% in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and 20.0% in the efgartigimod IV arm. Neutralizing antibodies against 
efgartigimod  were  detected  in  3.6%  of  the  participants  in  each  arm.  The  incidence  of  antibodies  against 
rHuPH20 was 5.5% and no NAb against rHuPH20 were detected. Efgartigimod SC is considered moderate to 
highly immunogenic but no sign of an impact of ADAs on the PK of efgartigimod has been observed.  
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  PD  and  the  PK-PD  (exposure-response)  relationship  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  has  been  studied  in  both 
healthy  participants  and  patients  with  gMG.  The  primary  PD  endpoint  in  studies  ARGX-113-1907  (healthy 
Assessment report

subjects) and ARGX-113-2001 (patients with gMG) was the percent reduction from baseline in total IgG levels 
at day 29 (ie, week 4, 7 days after the fourth IV or SC administration) at the noninferiority margin of 10%. 
The secondary PD endpoints investigated were IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and AChR-Ab. Compared to the gMG 
IV submission, no additional data on anti-muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies became 
available. 
Mechanism of action 
The  FcRn  has  a  specific  role  in  IgG  homeostasis  and  recycles  all  IgG  subtypes  (IgG1,  IgG2,  IgG3,  IgG4), 
rescuing them from intracellular lysosomal degradation. FcRn binds to pinocytosed IgG and protects the IgG 
from  transport  to  degradative  lysosomes  by  recycling  it  back  to  the  extracellular  compartment.  This  FcRn-
mediated  recycling  accounts  for  the  longer  half-life  and  higher  plasma  concentrations  of  IgGs  compared  to 
other immunoglobulins that are not recycled by FcRn. Efgartigimod alfa is a human IgG1 Fc-fragment modified 
to have an increased affinity to FcRn. Efgartigimod outcompetes endogenous IgG binding, preventing FcRn-
mediated recycling of IgGs and results in increased IgG degradation including pathogenic IgG autoantibodies. 
Compared  to  the  wild-type  Fc  fragment,  efgartigimod  has  significantly  increased  affinity  for  human  FcRn  at 
both neutral and acidic pH. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Healthy subjects 
Study ARGX-113-1907 
This  was  a  phase  1,  randomized,  open-label,  parallel-group  study  to  compare  the  pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetics,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  4  once-weekly  intravenous  infusions  of  efgartigimod  10  mg/kg 
with 4 once-weekly subcutaneous injections of efgartigimod PH20 1000 mg in healthy subjects. A total of 54 
male and female subjects were randomized and dosed in a 1:1 ratio.  
Based on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the primary endpoint, efgartigimod PH20 SC was noninferior 
to efgartigimod IV in total IgG level reduction at day 29 at the noninferiority margin of 10%. After 4 weekly 
administrations of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg or efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg, the pattern of total IgG change 
was  comparable  between  both  treatment  groups.  The  absolute  values  of  total  IgG  and  percentage  changes 
from baseline in IgG levels over time for the efgartigimod PH20 SC and efgartigimod IV groups are presented 
in the below figure. In general, the IgG subtypes (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) revealed a similar reduction 
pattern over time.

Patients with gMG 
Study ARGX-113-2001 
This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  parallel-group,  multicenter  study  in  participants  with  gMG.  Eligible 
participants  were  AChR-Ab  seropositive  or  seronegative.  A  total  of  111  participants  were  enrolled  and 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg or efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg once 
weekly for 4 administrations. 
The primary PD endpoint in study ARGX-113-2001 was the percent reduction from baseline in total IgG levels 
at day 29 (ie, week 4, 7 days after the fourth administration) in the overall population (ie, AChR-Ab seropositive 
and AChR-Ab seronegative participants with gMG). The primary endpoint of ARGX-113-2001 was met. Total 
IgG reduction at day 29 in participants with gMG who received efgartigimod PH20 SC1000 mg was noninferior 
to  that  in  participants  who  received  efgartigimod  IV  10  mg/kg  after  1  treatment  cycle  of  4  weekly 
administrations (noninferiority margin of 10%). The least-squares mean estimate of the percent change from 
baseline in total IgG level at day 29 was -66.4% (95% CI: -68.91% to -63.86%) in the efgartigimod PH20 SC 
arm and -62.2% (95% CI: -64.66% to -59.71%) in the efgartigimod IV arm. The corresponding least-squares 
mean  difference  in  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in  total  IgG  levels  at  day  29  between  the  2  arms 
(efgartigimod IV vs efgartigimod PH20 SC) was -4.2% (95% CI: -7.73% to -0.66%). Thus, the upper limit of 
the CI (-0.66%) was below the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10% (below table). 
The results were consistent when the ANCOVA analysis was repeated for total IgG in the AChR-Ab seropositive 
population.

After administration of 4 weekly injections of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg, the pattern of total IgG reduction 
was similar in healthy subjects and patients with gMG (figure below).

In study 2001, a clear correlation between decline in total IgG and AChR-Ab levels in the seropositive population 
was  demonstrated  (Figure  27).  The  reduction  in  AChR-Ab  from  baseline  is  similar  between  SC  and  IV 
administration of efgartigimod (Figure 28).

Intersubject variability in PD 
The intersubject variability on total IgG levels during the first cycle of 4 weekly administrations of efgartigimod 
PH20 SC 1000 mg in the phase 3 study ARGX-113-2001 was moderate to high with %CV over time ranging 
from 38.8% to 53.3%.  
The intersubject variability on absolute AChR-Ab levels was high with %CV over time ranging from 203.5% to 
274.9%. A large variability in baseline AChR-Ab data was observed (%CV=503%). 
AChR-Ab serotype  
The  AChR-Ab  serotype  had  no  effect  on  the  PD  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC.  Levels  of  total  IgG  in  AChR-Ab 
seropositive and AChR-Ab seronegative participants were reduced to a similar extent. 
Impact of ADA on PD 
There was no meaningful difference in the percent change from cycle baseline in total IgG levels (PD) across 
the cycles between participants negative for ADA against efgartigimod when compared with participants with 
treatment-induced, treatment-boosted, or treatment-unaffected ADA against efgartigimod (figures below).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has been granted a marketing authorisation for efgartigimod as an IV product, and the present line 
extension concerns a fixed dose of 1000 mg efgartigimod coformulated with the permeation enhancer rHuPH20 
(2000 U/mL) for SC administration. The proposed posology is 1000 mg efgartigimod once weekly for four weeks 
with subsequent treatment cycles according to clinical evaluation, the same administration regimen as with IV 
administration.  
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  for  the  SC  application  assessed  the  PK,  PD,  and  immunogenicity  of 
efgartigimod administered SC (or IV for comparison) in two phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (ARGX-113-
1901 and ARGX-113-1907) and in two phase 3 studies in patients with gMG (ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-
2002). The aim of the fixed SC dose regimen was to find a dose resulting in a similar PD effect as achieved 
with the treatment cycle of efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg. Based on the similar effects on IgG, AChR-Ab, and MG-
ADL the selected dose for SC administration seems to be acceptable.   
A  sandwich  immunoassay  on  the  Gyrolab  Bioaffy  system  was  validated  for  quantification  of  efgartigimod  in 
Study 2001. This method was cross validated with an older ELISA method. Cross-validation results indicated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 62/173 
 
 
 
 
the ELISA method gave 38.5% lower results for concentrations <10 µg/mL than the Gyrolab method and it 
seemed only study samples were affected, not spiked samples. This could indicate the older method and thus 
the  drug  quantification  in  earlier  studies  e.g.,  Study  1907  and  1901  was  impacted  by  the  matrix  of  study 
samples (maybe ADA formation). A validated immunoassay method for measurement of IgG subtypes (IgG1, 
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgA, and IgM was also submitted with this extension. The efgartigimod ADA assay (an ACE-
bridging ELISA) was re-validated and submitted with this extension after substantial changes were made to 
the assay. Drug tolerance at 100 ng/mL ADA PC level was improved from 5.66 µg/mL to 30.9 µg/mL (screening 
assay) and to at least 100 µg/mL (confirmatory assay) efgartigimod. The updated method was applied in Study 
2001 and 2002, while the old method with limited drug tolerance was applied in Study 1702, 1907 and 1901. 
There is no quantitation method for rHuPH20 as it is not systemically detectable. Validated methods were used 
for screening, confirmation and titration of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies and for detection of NAbs to rHuPH20. The 
MAH  commits  to  submit  the  final  bioanalytical  reports  covering  data  from  extension  study  ARGX-113-2002 
upon study finalisation (REC). 
The  popPK  model  for  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  was  based  on  a  3-compartment  PK  model  submitted  for  the 
approved IV treatment and containing the assumption that V2 = V3 while IIV was included on CL, V1, V2/V3, 
Ka and covariance between CLxV1. Data from Study 2001 was included in model development. The final PopPK 
model  could  predict  the  data  in  Study  2001  and  in  Study  2002  (data  cut-off  12  Jan  2021,  external  fit).  An 
indirect response model including data from studies 1501, 1602, 1702, 1704, 1901 and 1907 was updated with 
data from Study 2001 to describe the PK/total IgG relation of efgartigimod. Individual total IgG observations 
from Study 2001 indicated the proposed SC dosing can lead to a better IgG response than observed after IV 
treatment. The existing PK/total IgG/binding AChRAb model based on the final PK/total IgG model and AChRAb 
data collected in seropositive and in seronegative gMG patients from IV studies 1602 (n=12) and 1704 (n=84), 
was updated with AChRAb data collected in seropositive patients from Study 2001. Covariate effects were all 
fixed and came from the final PK/total IgG model and were thus related to the total IgG data. A bounded integer 
model for MG-ADL score with data from studies 1602, 1704 and 1705 (all IV dosed) was updated with MG-ADL 
score from study 2001. The final PK/total lgG/binding AChRAb model was used to predict the binding AChRAb 
concentrations as a measure of drug effect at the time-points for MG-ADL scoring, however, the model was 
based on a dataset that included both AChRAb seropositive (n=220) and seronegative patients (n=57). The 
MAH  considers  that  the  submitted  MG-ADL  total  score  model  based  on  the  overall  population  is  suitable  for 
clinical  effect  simulations  and  is  adequately  reflecting  the  AChR-Ab  seropositive  population  receiving  the 
efgartigimod PH20 SC treatment. Following a model update by exclusion of data from seronegative patients, 
the  drug  effect  parameter  α  changed  from  −0.262  to  −0.301  with  overlapping  95%CIs.  It  is  agreed  that 
excluding the data from AChR-Ab seronegative patients did not change the parameter estimates of the final 
MG-ADL  Score  model  much  nor  resulted  in  a  better  fit  as  judged  from  VPCs.  However,  to  predict  AChR-Ab 
levels  in  seronegative  patients  in  order  to  include  data  from  this  sub-group  of  patients  is  not  considered 
adequate. The MAH argues that these predicted levels may represent unknown autoantibodies. Data from the 
AChR-Ab seronegative patient population just introduce bias and should not be included in the PD population. 
Due to performance similarities of the two models, the simulations made within this procedure are accepted 
for this procedure only. For future applications, however, inclusion of data from AChR-Ab seronegative patients 
in the PD/efficacy models for seropositive patients will not be accepted.  
In gMG patients, the observed exposure in terms of Ctrough is slightly higher (approximately 50%) in the SC 
arm compared with the IV arm, while AUC is comparable.  Ctrough was similar between AChR-Ab seropositive 
and  seronegative  patients.  Based  on  popPK  modelling,  the  estimated  bioavailability  of  efgartigimod  SC  is 
76.5%. The PK results of efgartigimod with or without the absorption enhancer indicate that the absorption is 
significantly faster with the enhancer but the overall exposure is comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 63/173 
 
 
The volume of distribution is 18 L. As expected, the rate of elimination in healthy subjects is similar between 
IV  and  SC  administered  efgartigimod.  Further,  the  elimination  rate  is  not  affected  by  the  presence  of  the 
absorption  enhancer.  The  accumulation  after  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  1000  mg  was  minimal,  and  no  time 
dependency has been demonstrated.  
Dose proportionality has not been assessed after multiple SC dosing; this is acceptable. After single SC doses 
of 750 to 1750 mg efgartigimod, it is agreed that a trend of more than dose-proportional increase in exposure 
with increasing SC doses cannot be excluded. However, as stated by the Applicant, the analyses are based on 
little data (n=8 in each dose group), so no conclusion can be made.  
Based  on  popPK  data,  the  variability  in  disposition  PK  parameters  following  the  SC  regimen  is  considered 
moderate.  In  healthy  volunteers,  the  variability  (CV)  in  Cmax  (42%)  and  AUC  (26%)  is  high  and  moderate, 
respectively.   
As for special populations, a combined dataset from healthy participants and participants with gMG receiving 
efgartigimod IV or efgartigimod PH20 SC, including data from study ARGX-113-2001, was used for the covariate 
analysis in the population PK/PD model development. The inclusion of SC data has not altered the effects of 
the special populations on the PK of efgartigimod.  
No clinical DDI studies have been conducted. According to the EMA guideline on therapeutic proteins this is 
acceptable.  As  informed  in  the  SmPC,  due  to  its  mode  of  action,  efgartigimod  is  expected  to  affect  the  PK 
and/or PD of compounds that bind to the human FcRn, ie, immunoglobulin products, monoclonal antibodies, or 
antibody derivatives containing the human Fc domain of the IgG subclass. 
As expected, the incidence of ADAs was higher in  the subcutaneous arm than in the IV arm in study 2001. 
However,  no  sign  of  any  impact  of  ADAs  on  PK,  PD,  efficacy,  or  safety  of  efgartigimod  treatment  has  been 
reported. 
When patients with gMG received 4 once-weekly administrations of either efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg or 
efgartigimod  IV  10  mg/kg  (study  2001),  the  reduction  from  baseline  in  total  IgG  at  day  29,  the  primary 
endpoint,  was  very  similar.  The  mean  maximum  reduction  was  slightly  higher  in  the  SC  group.  In  healthy 
subjects receiving IV or SC efgartigimod, the results are very similar. 
Based on data from study 1907 and 2001, the reduction in total IgG between healthy subjects and patients 
receiving SC efgartigimod was very similar.   
The AChR-Ab serotype (seropositive or seronegative) had no effect on the PD of efgartigimod PH20 SC. 
No  data  concerning  secondary  pharmacology  have  been  presented.  FcRn  promotes  transcytosis  of  IgG  into 
tissues  and  recycles  albumin;  however,  in  the  IV application  it  was  reported  that  there  was  no  reduction  in 
levels of serum albumin with the administration of efgartigimod.  
Due to the PD effects of efgartigimod, no QTc study has been conducted. This is acceptable. 
ADA does not seem to influence the PD effect on IgG.  
Exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analyses, using MG-ADL and TEAE as response parameters, showed no 
ER relationships.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of efgartigimod PH20 SC is documented in  both  healthy participants and  patients 
with  gMG.  The  primary  PD  endpoint  in  studies  ARGX-113-1907  (healthy  subjects)  and  ARGX-113-2001 
(patients  with  gMG)  was  the  percent  reduction  from  baseline  in  total  IgG  levels  at  day  29.  In  addition, 
population PK/PD analyses have been performed. Considering the nature of the product (a therapeutic protein), 
the pharmacology package is considered adequate and the proposed dosing of efgartigimod seems appropriate. 
A few PK/PD issues remains to be addressed.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:

Immunogenicity  of  Multiple  Subcutaneous  Injections  of  Efgartigimod  PH20  SC  With  Multiple 
Intravenous Infusions of Efgartigimod in Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis 
Methods 
The phase 3 study ARGX-113-2001 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12-week study 
based on the principle of PD-based bridging from efgartigimod IV to the SC route of administration. The bridging 
from efgartigimod IV to efgartigimod PH20 SC is done by demonstrating a similar PD effect, as measured by 
percent reduction from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29 by an NI margin of 10%, and by demonstrating 
that total IgG reduction was associated with a clinical response in participants with gMG. The selected patient 
population mirrored the eligibility criteria of the pivotal study of efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg, ARGX-113-1704. 
The overall study duration was approximately 12 weeks (2 weeks screening, 3 weeks treatment (once weekly 
starting at day 1, baseline), 7 weeks follow-up period)

Efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg or efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg once weekly for 4 administrations (4 doses on 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22) during 1 clinical cycle. Efgartigimod was administered concomitantly with a stable dose 
of the participant’s current gMG therapy, which could have included AChE inhibitors, steroids, and NSIDs.  
Efgartigimod IV was administered by a 1-hour infusion performed by the site staff.  
Efgartigimod PH20 SC was administered at the site by the study staff or by the participant (or their caregiver, 
as appropriate). 
During  the  study,  participants  may  NOT  receive  any  monoclonal  antibody,  other  experimental/study 
investigational  medical  product,  live  or  live-attenuated  vaccines,  a  change  in  the  dose  or  frequency  of  their 
current gMG, a change in concomitant therapy for gMG, PLEX, IVIg, immunoadsorption, or a change in dosage 
or type of corticosteroid used as a monotherapy or in combination. 
PLEX, IVIg, immunoadsorption, or a change in dosage or type of corticosteroid are considered rescue therapy 
if both of the following conditions apply: 
1. The treating physician believes that the participant’s health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is not 
provided and 
2. The participant is deteriorating clinically according to the protocol-defined criteria, which includes at 
least 1 of the following: a. new or worsening of respiratory/bulbar symptoms or b. at least a 2-point 
increase in any individual non-ocular items on the MG-ADL scale as compared to the previous visit.

Primary objective and endpoint 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the noninferiority (NI) of the SC formulation compared 
with the IV formulation in treating participants with gMG using total IgG percent reduction at day 29 based on 
an NI margin of 10%. 
The primary endpoint was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a factor 
and  total  IgG  levels  at  baseline  as  a  covariate.  The  NI  evaluation  was  based  on  a  percent  reduction  from 
baseline in total IgG levels at day 29 (week 4) using an NI margin of 10%. 
Based on the ICH E10 and FDA NI guidance, the hypotheses for evaluating NI are as follows: 
•  Null  hypothesis:  the  difference  in  percent  reduction  from  baseline  of  total  IgG  at  day  29  for  the  SC 
treatment arm compared with the IV treatment arm will be ≥10 (ie, μIV − μSC ≥10)  
•  Alternate hypothesis: the difference in percent reduction from baseline of total IgG at day 29 for the 
SC treatment arm compared with the IV treatment arm will be <10 (ie, μIV − μSC <10) 
In  ARGX-113-1704,  the  mean  (SE)  of  total  IgG  percent  reduction  at  week  4  of  C1  was  62.2  (0.82)  in  the 
efgartigimod IV group and 0.1 (2.23) in the placebo group, which translates to a treatment effect of 62.1 with 
a  2-sided  95%  CI  of  (57.44-66.76).  With  a  NI  margin  of  10%  in  total  IgG  percent  reduction,  84%  (1–
10/62.2×100%) of the PD effect is expected to be preserved. 
Other objectives and endpoints 
The secondary and exploratory endpoints were summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment arm and 
overall among all participants. 
Similar to the primary analysis, a random-intercept model for the MG-ADL score with the percentage total IgG 
reduction from baseline as a predictor suggested that a decrease of 10% would translate into a preservation 
of 86% of the effect in reduction in MG-ADL change at week 4 (100×[1–0.35/2.5]). Week 4 was chosen as the 
time point to evaluate reduction in total IgG because it demonstrated the maximum reduction in total IgG 1 
week after the last dose in C1. Several other measures of the PD effect on total IgG reduction, such as AUEC 
and Emax, were performed to support the justification of the NI margin for ARGX-113-2001. 
Additional assessments of the association of PD parameters with clinical efficacy have been performed. For this 
assessment,  the  primary  endpoint  (MG-ADL  responder)  of  ARGX-113-1704  was  used.  This  endpoint  is 
considered a representative endpoint because it concurs with the definition of a “consistent, maintained, and 
clinically relevant benefit.” Most of the responders (84%) in ARGX-113-1704 were observed between week 1 
and week 6. 
To assess the impact of maximum total IgG reduction while accounting for the total IgG trajectory over weeks 
1 to 4 of a cycle, the AUEC of percent reduction in total IgG was also evaluated in determining its relationship 
with MG-ADL response. Furthermore, the AUEC of percent reduction in total IgG is more representative for the 
overall exposure of the treatment captured by the PD marker, as opposed to a percent reduction in total IgG 
at a single time point (eg, week 4). 
Based on data from C1 to C3 of ARGX-113-1704, the association between the average AUEC of percent total 
IgG  reduction  on  the  MG-ADL  response  was  shown  to  be  highly  significant  in  the  AChR-Ab  seropositive 
population. The model predicted a loss of 3% to 4% clinical efficacy in terms of MG-ADL response, with a 10% 
less  decrease  in  the  average  AUEC  of  percent  IgG  reduction  between  the  baseline  to  week  4.  Table  below 
summarizes the predicted probability of MG-ADL response in AChR-Ab seropositive population.

Table 14: Study ARGX-113-1704: predicted probability of MG-ADL response at the average AUEC of percent 
reduction in total IgG with a 10% NI margin  
Additionally,  estimates  of  the  PTE  in  terms  of  the  MG-ADL  response  rates  explained  by  AUEC  of  percent 
reduction in total IgG reduction (PD bridging marker) are high, indicating that a large part of the treatment 
effect (efgartigimod versus placebo) is mediated through the reduction in total IgG in ARGX-113-1704. 
In  a  post-hoc  manner,  similar  to  the  ANCOVA  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  the  percent  change  from 
baseline in AChR-Ab levels at day 29 was analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as a factor and 
baseline AChR-Ab levels as a covariate in AChR-Ab seropositive participants in the mITT analysis set. The p-
value for testing the same null hypothesis of NI as specified in the protocol is provided. 
•  Sample size 
Approximately 110 participants were planned to be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg or efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg once weekly for 4 administrations in an open-
label design.  
The sample size was based on data from ARGX-113-1704 in participants with gMG (efgartigimod IV formulation) 
and ARGX-113-1907 in healthy participants (efgartigimod IV and SC formulations). The mean percent reduction 
in total IgG levels with the IV formulation was expected to be approximately 62 (SD: 7.5). Assuming a total 
IgG  percent  reduction  from  baseline  at  day  29  with  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  of  60±7.5,  20  participants  per 
treatment arm were needed for 90% power to detect NI at the 10% level using a 1-sided, 2-sample t-test at 
a 2.5% significance level. To account for attrition, 46 participants were planned to be recruited. The sample 
size was to be adjusted based on the SD of the total IgG percent reduction from baseline at day 29 in the SC 
arm  of  ARGX-113-1907.  If  the  SD  was  8.5  or  10,  than  the  sample  size  was  to  be  increased  to  50  or  68, 
respectively. To account for attrition, additional participants per treatment arm (6 or 8, respectively) were to 
be added.

However,  in  protocol  version  2.0  (Appendix  16.1.1)  the  sample  size  was  increased  to  approximately  110 
participants to provide better quantification of the clinical safety and efficacy profile of the PH20 SC formulation, 
and the IV formulation served as a reference treatment arm in this randomized study. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomization was stratified by Japanese versus non-Japanese participants. Within non-Japanese participants, 
randomization  was  further  stratified  by  AChR-Ab  status.  Up  to  20%  of  the  randomized  participants  were 
expected  to  be  seronegative  for  AChR-Ab  in  both  the  overall  population  and  the  Japanese  participant 
population. 
•  Statistical methods 
Clinical efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT analysis set. PD analyses were performed on the mITT 
analysis  set.  General  characteristics,  safety,  and  immunogenicity  analyses  were  performed  on  the  safety 
analysis set. The PK analysis set was used for the PK analysis. The AChR-Ab seropositive subset population 
was defined based on the actual laboratory results. All AEs and clinical laboratory abnormalities were treatment-
emergent. 
• ITT analysis set: all randomized participants who were exposed to the IMP 
•  mITT  analysis  set:  all  randomized  participants  with  a  value  for  total  IgG  levels  at  baseline  and  at  least  1 
postbaseline time point 
• Safety analysis set: all randomized participants who were exposed to IMP 
• PK analysis set: a subset of the safety analysis set with at least 1 postdose PK measurement 
The primary endpoint was analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as a factor and total IgG levels at 
baseline as a covariate. The NI evaluation was based on a percent reduction from baseline in total IgG levels 
at day 29 (week 4) using an NI margin of 10%. 
The secondary endpoints were summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment arm and overall among all 
participants. In addition, the difference in the percentage of MG-ADL responders between the 2 treatment arms 
was analysed using the meta-analysis predictive approach while incorporating treatment cycle 1 data from the 
efgartigimod IV treatment arm in ARGX-113-1704 as historically active controls (Bayesian hierarchical model). 
The exploratory endpoints were summarized with descriptive statistics. 
The planned analyses and determination of sample size are described in the final version of the SAP in Appendix 
16.1.9, and provided in protocol version 2.0 in Appendix 16.1.1. 
The following post hoc analyses were performed: 
• After evaluating the MG-related procedures reported in the final locked study database, “enteral nutrition” 
was added as an MG-related procedure for statistical analysis. 
• All prior therapies for myasthenia gravis that started before the first IMP administration, regardless of when 
they were stopped, were summarized. 
• The ANCOVA analysis of the primary endpoint in the mITT analysis set, the per-protocol analysis set, and all 
AChR-Ab seropositive participants in the mITT analysis set was repeated to provide a p-value for testing the 
null hypothesis of NI as prespecified in the protocol. The SAP planned to provide the 2-sided 95% CI of the 
difference  in  the  percentage  of  the  total  IgG  reduction  at  week  4  between  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  and 
Assessment report

efgartigimod  IV  to  evaluate  NI  by  confirming  whether  the  upper  limit  exceeded  10%.  This  is  operationally 
equivalent to performing a 1-sided test at the 2.5% level using the prespecified ANCOVA model. A listing of 
participants who were not included in the ANCOVA analysis for the primary endpoint in the mITT analysis set 
was provided. A sensitivity analysis for the ANCOVA analysis of the primary endpoint in the mITT analysis set 
was  performed  by  imputing  missing  primary  endpoint  data  with  the  first  value  at  or  after  the  last  IMP 
administration. 
• Similar to the ANCOVA analysis of the primary endpoint, the percent change from baseline in AChR-Ab levels 
at day 29 was analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as a factor and baseline AChR-Ab levels as a 
covariate in AChR-Ab seropositive participants in the mITT analysis set. The p-value for testing the same null 
hypothesis of NI as specified in the protocol is provided. 
•  A  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  actual  values  and  percent  change  from  baseline  in  total  IgG  levels  and  IgG 
subtypes over time was performed by excluding results for all IgG assessments after administration of IVIg or 
plasmapheresis rescue therapy. 
• Additional analyses on the reported QMG total score were performed, including descriptive statistics of the 
actual values and changes from baseline by AChR-Ab status and frequency  tabulations of actual values and 
changes from baseline for the overall population and by AChR-Ab status. 
• Injection site reactions, defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) high-level term 
of Injection site reactions, were summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). In the 
efgartigimod PH20 SC arm, data were further summarized by outcome and toxicity grade. The prevalence and 
incidence of Injection site reactions by injection period and the number and percentage of participants who had 
Injection site reactions by number of injections in participants with 4 administrations were also summarized. 
• A correlation analysis between immunogenicity and Injection site reactions was performed. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Of the 153 participants screened for inclusion, 34 (22.2%) participants did not meet the eligibility criteria.  
A total of 111 participants were enrolled and randomized: 55 participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and 
56 in the efgartigimod IV arm. One participant was randomized to the efgartigimod IV arm but did not receive 
efgartigimod due to an AE.

Table 15: Participant disposition (safety analysis set)  
A  total  of  53  (96.4%)  participants  in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  arm  and  52  (94.5%)  participants  in  the 
efgartigimod IV arm rolled over to ARGX-113-2002. 
In the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm, 49 (89.1%) participants received all 4 doses. In the efgartigimod IV arm, 
55 (100%) participants received all 4 doses. Two (3.6%) participants discontinued treatment due to AEs and 
missed  3  doses.  One  participant  missed  the  third  dose  as  the  result  of  a  treatment  interruption  due  to  an 
AE/SAE. Additionally, 1 participant missed the third dose due to a missed study visit, and 1 participant missed 
the second dose due to an unknown reason. Per protocol, participants who missed a dose were not required to 
be discontinued from IMP and could continue in the study. 
•  Recruitment 
Study Initiation Date: 05 Feb 2021 (first participant’s first visit) 
Study Completion Date: 13 Dec 2021 (last participant’s last visit) 
This study was conducted at 43 sites that randomized participants in Belgium, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, 
Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, and the United States. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, version 1.0 (15 Oct 2020), was amended once (version 2.0, 02 Jul 2021). In addition, 
data  were  analysed  according  to  the  SAP  version  1.0,  dated  01  Feb  2022.  An  independent  Data  Safety 
Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  periodically  reviewed  and  evaluated  the  accumulated  study  data  for  participant 
safety,  study  conduct,  and  study  progress.  Major  protocol  deviations  led  to  the  exclusion  of  6  (10.9%) 
participants in each arm from the per-protocol analysis set.

Primary Endpoint 
The  primary  PD  endpoint  was  the  percent  reduction  from  baseline  in  total  IgG  levels  at  day  29.  Total  IgG 
reduction at day 29 in participants with gMG who received efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg was NI to that in 
participants who received efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg after 1 treatment cycle of 4 weekly administrations (refer 
to the PD results section above).

Post hoc Analysis - Reduction in AChR-Ab levels 
Decreases in AChR-Ab levels followed a comparable time course as total IgG levels in AChR-Ab positive patients 
and were similar between the efgartigimod alfa SC and IV groups. Maximum mean percentage decreases in 
AChR-Ab levels of 62.2% and 59.6% were observed one week after the last administration in the efgartigimod 
alfa SC and IV groups, respectively (figure below).

Supportive Study ARGX-113-2002 (Phase 3 Open-Label Extension of Studies ARGX-113-2001 and 
ARGX-113-1705) Interim Analysis 1 
ARGX-113-2002 is an ongoing study that enrolled participants from ARGX-113-2001 or ARGX-113-1705 (refer 
to Table 1 above for details). The first IA of ARGX-113-2002 includes all participants who received treatment 
with efgartigimod PH20 SC by the time of the data cutoff date (March 2, 2022). Data from ARGX-113-2002 
provide supportive evidence of the efficacy of efgartigimod PH20 SC for up to 5 cycles.  
Main inclusion/exclusion criteria included (among others): 
•  Previously participated in antecedent studies ARGX-113-2001 or ARGX-113-1705 and are eligible for 
rollover as defined by: 
a. For ARGX-113-2001 
o  Completed the study and performed the EoS visit, or 
o  Were  discontinued  from  study  treatment  for  reasons  other  than  pregnancy  or  an  (S)AE. 
Receiving rescue therapy is not exclusionary unless given in a response to a life-threatening 
situation 
b. For ARGX-113-1705 
o  Performed the end of part A, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 88/173 
 
 
 
o  Started Part B, received the previous dose of efgartigimod IV at least 30 days prior to entry 
into this study, completed at least 1 year of study ARGX-113-1705, and performed the early 
discontinuation visit in ARGX-113-1705 
o  Did not have 3 consecutive treatment failures in ARGX-113-1705 Part A, even if the participant 
received  rescue  therapy  (unless  rescue  therapy  was  given  in  response  to  a  life-threatening 
situation). Treatment failure is defined as the absence of a decrease of at least 2 points in total 
MG-ADL score compared to the subsequent TP baseline in at least 50% of the assessments 
o  Are  still  receiving  concomitant  gMG  medication.  Participants  who  have  stopped  taking  any 
concomitant medication for gMG are not eligible for rollover 
o  Participants may rollover from ARGX-113-1705 until recruitment for this study is closed 
Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: 
•  The  participant  was  discontinued  early  from  studies  ARGX-113-2001  or  ARGX-113-1705,  unless  the 
reason for discontinuation from study ARGX-113-1705 was to rollover into study ARGX-113-2002 
a. Participants who, in the investigator’s judgment, are not benefiting from efgartigimod IV in study 
ARGX-113-1705 Part B are not eligible for rollover into ARGX-113-2002 
As of the cutoff date, a total of 178 participants rolled over to ARGX-113-2002 from the antecedent studies 
ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-1705. Of these, 53 participants received efgartigimod PH20 SC in ARGX-113-
2001, 52 participants received efgartigimod IV in ARGX-113-2001, and 73 participants received efgartigimod 
IV in ARGX-113-1705. Of the 178 participants enrolled in this study, 164 participants received efgartigimod 
PH20 SC and are defined as the total group. 
Overall, 4 (2.4%) participants discontinued treatment, and 160 (97.6%) participants were still ongoing. 
In the total group, the mean (SD) study duration was 169.7 (58.82) days. The mean (SD) duration of all cycles 
combined, was 160.6 (60.17) days, which resulted in 72.1 patient-years of follow-up. The median (min, max) 
duration of all cycles combined was 172.5 (7, 311) days. 
A treatment period and its corresponding intertreatment period were grouped into cycles for analysis. Median 
cycle  durations  were  56.0  days  for  C1,  56.0  days  for  C2,  50.0  days  for  C3,  and  50.0  days  for  C4,  with  the 
maximum cycle duration of C1 reaching up to 204 days. Overall, most participants (65.1%, 75.2%, 86.8%, 
and 96.0% in C1, C2, C3, and C4, respectively) had a cycle duration of 7 weeks, which aligns with the protocol-
specified minimum duration of a cycle. 
The majority of participants were AChR-Ab seropositive (81.7%). The median age was 50.0 years and most 
participants were White (89.6%) and female (64.6%). A total of 14 (8.5%) participants were Japanese. 
In  the  AChR-Ab  seropositive  population,  the  maximum  MG-ADL  total  score  reduction  from  cycle  baseline 
decreased with subsequent cycles because the cycle baseline MG-ADL total score decreased with subsequent 
cycles (Figure below). MG-ADL total scores did not return to study baseline levels before initiation of the next 
cycle because participants were retreated based on the investigator’s judgment rather than a specific MG-ADL 
total score threshold. The mean (SE) change from study baseline in MG-ADL total score in the total group at 
week 4 in the AChR-Ab seropositive population was −4.1 (0.29) in C1, −4.0 (0.32) in C2, −4.2 (0.35) in C3, 
and −4.6 (0.46) in C4 (figure below).

Feasibility of Self-Administration of Efgartigimod PH20 SC 
Per  protocol,  efgartigimod  may  have  been  administered  at  home.  When  efgartigimod  administration  was 
performed at home, the associated visit was performed by phone. 
Of  the  total  number  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  administrations,  42.8%  were  performed  by  site  staff  on
site, 
-
30.5% were performed by the participant at home, 24.8% were performed by the participant on-site, 0.8% 
were performed by the caregiver at home, and 0.9% were performed by the caregiver on-site. By the second 
treatment  visit  of  C4,  >70%  of  the  participants  performed  self-administration  at  home,  with  47  (72.3%) 
participants,  45  (71.4%)  participants,  and  43  (76.8%)  participants  doing  so  at  visits  2,  3,  and  4  of  C4, 
respectively. 
ARGX-113-1705-IA4 (31 Jan 2022) 
Supportive efficacy results were reported for up to 17 cycles of efgartigimod IV in ARGX-113-1705. 
151 participants rolled over to ARGX-113-1705. Overall, 91 (62.8%) participants have discontinued treatment, 
including 56 (38.6%) participants who enrolled in the open-label ARGX-113-2002 to receive efgartigimod PH20 
SC;  thus,  35  (24.1%)  participants  discontinued  efgartigimod  treatment.  A  total  of  15  (10.3%)  participants 
completed the study. The study is ongoing.  
The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  treatment  combined  with  follow-up  was  548.0  (231.79)  days,  which  results  in 
217.55  patient-years  of  observation.  The  median  (min,  max)  study  duration  with  follow-up  was  588.0  (40, 
924) days. Treatment combined with follow-up was <6 months for 14 (9.7%) participants, 6 to <12 months 
for 18 (12.4%) participants, 12 to <18 months for 23 (15.9%) participants, 18 to <24 months for 49 (33.8%) 
participants, 24 to <30 months for 38 (26.2%) participants, and 30 to <36 months for 3 (2.1%) participants. 
Median cycle durations for the first 16 cycles of efgartigimod IV in ARGX-113-1705 (50.0-68.0 days: Module 
5.3.5.2,  ARGX-113-1705-IA4  CSR,  Table  14.1.1.5.3)  were  similar  to  median  cycle  durations  for  the  first  4 
cycles of efgartigimod PH20 SC in ARGX-113-2002 (50.0-56.0 days), indicating consistency of efficacy after 
switching from efgartigimod IV to efgartigimod PH20 SC. 
The  mean  (SE)  change  from  cycle  baseline  in  the  MG-ADL  total  score  in  the  total  efgartigimod  AChR-Ab 
seropositive population observed at week 3 was −5.0 (0.33) in C1, −5.3 (0.36) in C2, −5.3 (0.37) in C3, −5.9 
(0.42) in C4, −5.8 (0.40) in C5, −5.6 (0.43) in C6, −6.4 (0.48) in C7, −6.4 (0.50) in C8, −7.2 (0.49) in C9, 
−7.5 (0.65) in C10, −5.7 (0.88) in C11, −6.7 (0.72) in C12, −6.1 (0.94) in C13, and −5.2 (1.08) in C14. 
In  the  AChR-Ab  seropositive  population,  in  the  majority  of  cycles  (11  out  of  14)  and  including  the  first  10 
cycles,  >90%  of  participants  had  a  minimum  improvement  from  cycle  baseline  of  ≥2  points  in  the  MG-ADL 
total score. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  subject  of  this  submission  is  a  line  extension  request  to  the  Vyvgart  marketing  authorization  for  a  new 
pharmaceutical form (solution for injection) associated with a new strength  (1 000 mg)  and a new route of 
administration (subcutaneous use): Vyvgart 1 000 mg, solution for injection). 
The  dose  is  1000  mg  administered  SC  in  cycles  of  once-weekly  injections  for  4  weeks.  The  frequency  of 
treatment  cycles  with  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  may  vary  by  patient.  Subsequent  treatment  cycles  will  be 
administered according to clinical evaluation.

The main evidence for demonstration of the efficacy of IV formulation was based on data from a single 26-
week, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial (Study ARGX-113-1704) which included mainly two 
cycles  of  treatment.  The  maintenance  of  the  effect  (beyond  the  initial  one  to  three  cycles)  was  based  on 
available  results  from  the  ongoing  open  label  study  (Study  ARGX-113-1705,  data  cut-off  date  01  February 
2021) with an intended duration of 3 years and was limited to analyses of MG-ADL changes (different definition 
and timing from primary endpoint in pivotal study). 
ARGX-113-2001  is  considered  the  main  study  for  this  application  (for  SC  administration),  while  data  from 
ARGX-113-2002 is supportive for maintenance of effect or safety profile after the first cycle.  
There  are  no  specific  CHMP  guidelines  for  myasthenia  gravis  therapeutic  area  or  for  formulation  change  in 
treatment of this population. Study ARGX-113-2001 was conducted as a confirmatory trial and is acceptable 
for the purpose of showing “therapeutic equivalence” of the two formulations despite some concerns discussed 
below. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To  bridge  the  results  of  the  placebo-controlled  study  ARGX-113-1704  (using  efgartigimod  IV)  to  the  SC 
formulation, ARGX-113-2001, a phase 3, randomized, 12-week open-label study with PD, PK, efficacy, safety, 
tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  endpoints  was  conducted  in  participants  with  gMG  to  show  therapeutic 
equivalence of SC and IV formulations during 1 clinical cycle (includes 4 weekly administrations and follow up).  
Main inclusion/exclusion criteria are resembling the criteria for the pivotal study for iv formulation (ARGX-113-
1704). The inclusion criteria are specific for gMG limiting the population to symptomatic patients with confirmed 
diagnosis, and together with exclusion criteria can generally be considered suitable to define a relevant patient 
population; however, with some limitations. Eligible subjects were males or females, aged 18 years or older, 
with  confirmed  diagnosis  of  MG  (determined  by  electrophysiological/  pharmacological  confirmation)  and 
symptomatic generalized MG (who are defined as patients with MG-ADL total score of ≥5 points at screening 
and baseline with >50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms, but not in manifest myasthenic 
crisis, so MGFA class II, III, IVa, or IVb were enrolled). 
It is critical to keep in mind that efgartigimod treatment is not indicated for patients in impending or manifest 
mysthenic  crisis  (a  serious,  life-threatening,  rapid  worsening  of  MG  and  potential  airway  compromise  from 
ventilatory or bulbar dysfunction). The use of efgartigimod is significantly different from the use of IVIg or PLEX 
treatments which are appropriately used as: short-term treatments in patients with MG with life-threatening 
signs such as respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia; in preparation for surgery in patients with significant bulbar 
dysfunction;  when  a  rapid  response  to  treatment  is  needed;  prior  to  beginning  corticosteroids  if  deemed 
necessary  to  prevent  or  minimize  exacerbations;  and  when  other  treatments  are  insufficiently  effective. 
Efgartigimod  is  not  replacing  IVIg  or  PLEX  use  in  MGFA  Class  V  patients  and  this  is  reflected  clearly  in  the 
SmPC.    
Both AChR-Ab seropositive and negative, or newly diagnosed and previously treated patients were enrolled. 
This  is  not  in  line  with  the  existing  indication  for  IV  formulation  as  it  is  limited  to  AChR-Ab  seropositive 
population. Efgartigimod was administered on top of stable background therapy (eg, NSIDs, steroids, and AChE 
inhibitors). Rescue therapy (PLEX, IVIg, immunoadsorption, new type or increased dose of corticosteroid) was 
permitted and resulted in discontinuation of the patient from the randomised treatment. Abdominal skin tissue 
was  evaluated  by  the  investigator  to  allow  for  absorption  and  assessment  of  local  safety  of  the  planned  SC 
injection, but this criterion did not lead to exclusion of patients from screening.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 94/173 
 
 
Patients were excluded if they had received any monoclonal antibody in the 6 months before IMP, undergone 
thymectomy within 3 months, had IV/SC/IM immunoglobulin or plasma exchange within 1 month of screening. 
In addition to concomitant or previous therapy, the exclusion criteria mainly addressed autoimmune diseases, 
infections and malignancy risk. Patients were excluded if they had documentation of a lack of clinical response 
to  PLEX  or  had  serum  IgG  levels  less  than  6  g/L  at  screening.  Patients  with  worsening  muscle  weakness 
secondary to concurrent infections or medications (aminoglycosides, beta-blockers, etc.), and who received a 
live-attenuated vaccine within the last 4 weeks prior to screening or were pregnant were excluded. The relevant 
warnings are inserted in SmPC. 
It is important to note that IV formulation has a weight-based dosing (10 mg/kg per infusion) up to 120kg, 
while SC formulation is a fixed dose for all weight ranges. However, weight-PD relationship is not established.  
A total of 111 participants were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either efgartigimod PH20 SC 
1000  mg  or  efgartigimod  IV  10  mg/kg  once  weekly  for  4  administrations  at  43  international  sites  (in  11 
countries): 55 participants in SC arm and 56 participants in IV arm. One participant was randomized to the 
efgartigimod IV arm but did not receive efgartigimod due to an AE (pyrexia). There were 110 participants (55 
in  each  arm)  in  all  analysis  sets  (safety,  ITT,  mITT)  which  reflected  all  randomized  participants  who  were 
exposed to the IMP or with a value for total IgG levels at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline time point. 80 
patients (73%) were enrolled in Europe, Georgia and Russia the population is considered as representative of 
patients  in  EU.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  Japanese  versus  non-Japanese  participants.  Within  non-
Japanese participants, randomization was further stratified by AChR-Ab status. In total 91 AChR-Ab seropositive 
patients were treated, 45 in SC and 46 in IV arm. 
The median age was 53.5 years (range: 19 to 84 years), with more of the participants across both arms in the 
18  to  <65  years  age  category  (80  [72.7%])  and  female  dominance  (65  [59.1%]).  A  total  of  8  (7.3%) 
participants met the definition of a Japanese participant.  
At  entry,  the  majority  of  patients  were  concomitantly  treated  with  anticholinesterases  (86.4%),  steroids 
(66.4%),  and  NSIDs  (43.6%)  and  no  changes  were  allowed  during  the  study.  69.1  %  had  at  least  2  prior 
therapies,  and  30%  of  patients  had  at  least  3  prior  therapies.  The  most  frequently  reported  MGFA  class  at 
screening  was  Class  III  in  54  (49.1%)  patients  followed  by  Class  II  in  51  (46.3%)  patients,  indicative  of  a 
symptomatic  patient  population  with  mild  to  moderate  weakness  affecting  muscles  other  than  the  ocular 
muscles (but still a milder population in terms of background therapies and MGFA class than the pivotal study 
for IV formulation). The mean baseline MG-ADL (8.7) and QMG (15.2) scores demonstrate substantial disease 
burden  despite  ongoing  generalised  myasthenia  gravis  treatment.  Overall,  107  (97.3%)  patients  completed 
treatment and 108 (98.2%) patients completed the study. Treatment compliance was 100% for IV arm while 
it  went  down  to  89.1%  for  SC  arm.  There  were  slight  imbalances  between  treatment  arms  in  terms  of 
demographics and disease characteristics, which are not considered significant as differences largely balance 
out each other not to favour one arm overall. 
PD noninferiority and clinical endpoints are used to show therapeutic equivalence of SC and IV formulations. 
The bridging approach is based on the association between reductions in both total IgG and AChR-Ab levels 
and improvement in the MG-ADL total score. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the NI of 
the SC formulation compared with the IV formulation in treating participants with gMG using total IgG percent 
reduction  at  day  29  based  on  an  NI  margin  of  10%-points.  The  primary  endpoint  was  analysed  using  an 
ANCOVA model with treatment as a factor and total IgG levels at baseline as a covariate. With a NI margin of 
10%-points  in  total  IgG  percent  reduction,  84%  (1–10/62.2×100%)  of  the  PD  effect  was  expected  to  be 
preserved. The primary endpoint is not considered adequate on its own to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence 
of two formulations. Total IgG reduction as a PD biomarker is not mechanistically linked to the disease but the 
Assessment report

reduction  of  AChR-Ab  levels  could  be  linked  for  AChR-Ab  seropositive  gMG  population.  The  comparison  of 
percent reductions from baseline in AChR-Ab levels at day 29 between two formulations was included as post-
hoc analysis. It was analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as a factor and baseline AChR-Ab levels 
as a covariate in AChR-Ab seropositive participants in the mITT analysis (similar to the ANCOVA analysis of the 
primary  endpoint).  The  p-value  for  testing  the  same  null  hypothesis  of  NI  as  specified  in  the  protocol  is 
provided.  
The secondary endpoints included PD, PK, efficacy, safety/tolerability, immunogenicity assessments while the 
exploratory  endpoints  were  evaluating  self-administration.  The  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  were 
summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment arm and overall among all participants, and reflected this 
way  in  the  SmPC.  Upon  request,  the  presentation  of  primary  or  secondary  endpoints  in  SmPC  reflects  the 
indication  sought  (AChR-Ab  seropositive  subpopulation,  mITT).    It  is  different  from  ARGX-113-1704  study 
where the primary analysis was based on AChR-Ab seropositive population.  
Secondary clinical efficacy endpoints used the scales which were used in the pivotal study for the iv formulation 
and this allows indirect comparison of changes in total scores over time or percentage of responders (especially 
for MG-ADL and QMG scales). The selected clinical scales are validated standard methods for evaluation of MG 
and  have  been  previously  used  in  several  clinical  studies  in  this  condition.  Based  on  data  from  C1  to  C3  of 
ARGX-113-1704,  the  association  between  the  average  AUEC  of  percent  total  IgG  reduction  on  the  MG-ADL 
response was shown to be highly significant in the AChR-Ab seropositive population. The model for NI margin 
predicted a loss of 3% to 4% clinical efficacy in terms of MG-ADL response, with a 10% less decrease in the 
average AUEC of percent IgG reduction between the baseline to week 4.  In the worst-case scenario, on MG-
ADL responder rate, the change of 95% confidence interval for the difference of IV-placebo (20.6% observed 
in ARGX-113-1704 Study) and the predicted SC-placebo would be around 3%.   This treatment effect size is 
considered marginal but acceptable as a lower boundary.   
There are no specific CHMP guidelines for myasthenia gravis therapeutic area or for demonstrating therapeutic 
equivalence in treatment of this population to support the choice of 10% NI margin. However, the issue is not 
pursued further as the data from ARGX-113-2001 is promising and that requesting a more thorough justification 
of the relevance of the current non-inferiority margin as opposed to other choices is not considered of value.  
Clinical efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT analysis set. Sensitivity analyses on the possible impact 
due to treatment discontinuation, use of excluded concomitant medication or missed doses was done within 
the estimand frame, using imputation strategies for missing values based on missing at random assumption, 
as well as missing not at random. Based from this, it was concluded that the estimated treatment difference 
was very robust with very little impact due to these intercurrent events. 
Study ARGX-113-2002 
After completing ARGX-113-2001, participants had the option to roll over to ARGX-113-2002. ARGX-113-2002 
is an ongoing study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of efgartigimod PH20 SC in participants who 
rolled over from either ARGX-113-2001 (in which they may have received efgartigimod IV or efgartigimod PH20 
SC) or ARGX-113-1705 (in which all participants received efgartigimod IV). As of the first interim analysis data 
cutoff date (March 2, 2022) included in this submission, participants have completed up to 5 cycles of treatment 
with efgartigimod PH20 SC according to clinical evaluation. 
A total of 178 participants rolled over to ARGX-113-2002: 73 participants who previously received efgartigimod 
IV in ARGX-113-1705; and from ARGX-113-2001, 53 participants who received SC and 52 participants who 
received IV treatment. 164 of these participants received efgartigimod PH20 SC in ARGX-113-2002 and are 
defined as the total group. 4 (2.4%) participants  discontinued treatment. Median cycle durations were 56.0 
Assessment report

Page 96/173 
 
 
days for C1, 56.0 days for C2, 50.0 days for C3, and 50.0 days for C4, with the maximum cycle duration of C1 
reaching up to 204 days. Overall, most participants (65.1%, 75.2%, 86.8%, and 96.0% in C1, C2, C3, and C4, 
respectively) had a cycle duration of 7 weeks, which aligns with the protocol-specified minimum duration of a 
cycle. The majority of participants were AChR-Ab seropositive (81.7%). 
Exclusion of patients who did not respond to efgartigimod treatment or had life-threatening events limits the 
translation of the results to the future real-life experience. Only MG-ADL scores, not QMG, were collected in 
follow up study. Being aware of the limitations, the data is assessed as supportive evidence for maintenance 
of efficacy beyond first cycle with SC formulation. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study ARGX-113-2001 
The primary endpoint was met in study ARGX-113-2001, meaning that the percent reduction from baseline in 
total IgG levels at day 29 in participants with gMG who received SC formulation was NI to that in participants 
who  received  IV  formulation  after  1  treatment  cycle  of  4  weekly  administrations  (refer  to  the  Clinical 
Pharmacology section for details). Results for total IgG levels at day 29 were consistent when analysed for the 
AChR-Ab seropositive population in the mITT analysis set. 
Decreases in AChR-Ab levels followed a comparable time course as total IgG levels in AChR-Ab positive patients. 
Maximum mean percentage decreases in AChR-Ab levels of 62.2% and 59.6% were observed one week after 
the  last  administration  in  the  efgartigimod  alfa  subcutaneous  and  intravenous  groups,  respectively.  As  the 
primary endpoint on total IgG levels cannot be mechanistically linked to the disease, and the exposure-response 
relationship might be different for pathogenic antibodies, AChR-Ab levels (pathogenic IgG) are considered the 
most important to show therapeutic equivalence.     
For both the efgartigimod alfa subcutaneous and intravenous groups, decrease in total IgG and AChR-Ab levels 
were  associated  with  and  preceded  a  clinical  response  in  AChR-Ab  positive  patients.  The  clinical  efficacy  of 
efgartigimod PH20 SC, using validated clinical outcome scales including the participant-reported MG-ADL scale 
(subjective assessment of MG symptoms) and the physician-assessed QMG scale (quantitative evaluation of 
relevant  muscle  groups),  was  similar  to  the  clinical  efficacy  of  efgartigimod  IV  showing  similar  decrease  in 
functional disability. In line with the sought indication for SC formulation, assessment of CHMP on clinical results 
are focused to AChR-Ab seropositive group only, disregarding overall population in clinical efficacy evaluation. 
During first treatment cycle in the AChR-Ab seropositive population, the MG-ADL responder criterion (based on 
a reduction of ≥2 points from baseline on the MG-ADL score for ≥4 consecutive weeks) was met in 71.1% and 
71.7% for participants in SC and IV arms, respectively (32 and 33 participants). The maximum reduction in 
MG-ADL total score was at week 4; the mean change from baseline at week 4 was −5.3 (0.42) versus −4.6 
(0.38) ([95% CI: −1.83 to 0.41]) in SC and IV arms, respectively. At week 10 (end of the study), the mean 
(SE)  change  from  baseline  in  MG-ADL  total  score  was  −2.4  (0.52)  versus  −2.2  (0.49)  in  SC  and  IV  arms, 
respectively. A 2-point reduction in MG-ADL total score can be considered as clinically meaningful and this was 
achieved and maintained for both groups in the first cycle. (As an indirect reference, in pivotal study for IV 
formulation, ARGX-113-1704, the mean (95% CI) change from baseline in the MG-ADL total score was -4.104 
(-5.007; -3.201) points in the efgartigimod group and -1.269 (-2.199; -0.339) points in the placebo group.) 
The percentage of QMG responders for the AChR-Ab seropositive population (based on a reduction of ≥3 points 
from baseline on the QMG score for ≥4 consecutive weeks) was 68.9% and 53.3% for participants in SC and 
IV arms, respectively. The maximum reduction in QMG total score was at week 4; the mean QMG change from 
Assessment report

Page 97/173 
 
 
baseline at week 4 was −6.5 (0.70) versus −5.4 (0.53) in SC and IV arms, respectively. At week 10 (end of 
the study), the mean (SE) change from baseline in QMG total score was −2.5 (0.70) versus −2.7 (0.61) in SC 
and IV arms, respectively. A 3.5-point difference has been shown to correlate with clinically meaningful change 
in QMG and this had been achieved at week 4 but was not maintained until week 10.   
Sensitivity  analyses  on  the  possible  impact  due  to  treatment  discontinuation,  use  of  excluded  concomitant 
medication or missed doses was done within the estimand frame, using imputation strategies for missing values 
based on missing at random assumption, as well as missing not at random. Based from this, it was concluded 
that the estimated treatment difference was very robust with very little impact due to these intercurrent events. 
Overall, two efgartigimod formulations have demonstrated a similar and clinically relevant efficacy in treatment 
of AChR-Ab seropositive population in one treatment cycle in study ARGX-113-2001, as rated by patients (MG-
ADL) and physicians (QMG).  
Decreases in AChR-Ab levels followed a comparable time course as total IgG levels (and preceded a clinical 
response)  in  AChR-Ab  positive  patients  and  were  similar  between  the  SC  and  IV  groups.  Maximum  mean 
percentage  decreases  in  AChR-Ab  levels  of  62.2%  and  59.6%  were  observed  one  week  after  the  last 
administration in SC and IV groups, respectively. 
Study ARGX-113-2002 
In  the  AChR-Ab  seropositive  population,  the  maximum  MG-ADL  total  score  reduction  from  cycle  baseline 
decreased with subsequent cycles, because participants were retreated based on the investigator’s judgment 
rather than a specific  MG-ADL total score threshold. The mean (SE) change from study baseline in MG-ADL 
total score in the total group at week 4 in the AChR-Ab seropositive population was −4.1 (0.29) in C1, −4.0 
(0.32) in C2, −4.2 (0.35) in C3, and −4.6 (0.46) in C4. 
In all 4 cycles, the MG-ADL improvements were at clinically meaningful level but demonstrated some differences 
between  cycles  and  groups.  For  the  participants  who  received  efgartigimod  IV  in  ARGX-113-2001  and 
efgartigimod PH20 SC in ARGX-113-2002, the MG-ADL improvements seem to be less and delayed compared 
to other two groups. The participants who received efgartigimod IV in ARGX-113-1705 and efgartigimod PH20 
SC in ARGX-113-2002 are in EFG IV(1705)-EFG SC group and have the best results. Better response in EFG 
IV(1705)-EFG  SC  group  could  be  influenced  by  selection  bias  as  patients  who  were  not  benefiting  from 
efgartigimod IV in study ARGX-113-1705 were not allowed to switch to ARGX-113-2002 study hence the SC 
formulation. The variability in MG-ADL improvements reached 1.9 points at week 4 for cycle 2 and 1.7 points 
at week 4 for cycle 3. Cycle 4 had data from 10 to 18 patients in each group, so was relatively limited. The 
variability is explained by the baseline differences and the treatment cycle difference.  
Self-administration in Study ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-2002 
The first dose of efgartigimod PH20 SC was to be administered by the investigator. According to the protocol, 
participants/caregivers could have administered subsequent doses after they were trained in administration. 
During study ARGX-113-2001, although 54 out of 55 participants in SC arm completed the self-administration/ 
caregiver-supported  administration  training,  only  42  (76.4%)  were  considered  adequately  trained  for  self-
administration  even  after  receiving  up  to  9  training  visits.  Afterwards,  this  situation  did  not  improve  much 
during open label follow up study. Although ARGX-113-2002 is a follow up study and a high dropout rate was 
observed, still only 31.3% of the administrations were performed by the participants/caregivers at home. The 
low  number  of  self-administrations  despite  many  training  attempts  during  both  studies  are  concerning.  The 
MAH clarified that participants who received efgartigimod IV during the antecedent study were no allowed to 
self-administer efgartigimod PH20 SC at home during the first treatment cycle in ARGX-113-2002. Additionally, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 98/173 
 
 
the first injection of each treatment period was required to be performed on site for operational reasons. The 
MAH used SmPC/PL material for training on self-administration. A demonstration of proper self-administration 
under supervision of healthcare professional is considered necessary during training. The first treatment cycle 
and first injection of the second treatment cycle is required to be performed by or under the supervision of a 
healthcare professional. Subsequent treatment should be administered by a healthcare professional or may be 
administered  by  a  patient  or  caregiver  after  adequate  training  in  the  subcutaneous  injection  technique. 
Guidance text has been added to the SmPC. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, in study ARGX-113-2001, SC and IV efgartigimod formulations (as add-on to standard therapy) have 
demonstrated a similar and clinically relevant efficacy in treatment of AChR-Ab seropositive population in one 
treatment cycle, as rated by patients and physicians and by total IgG reduction at day 29. This was supported 
by results from study ARGX-113-2002 for up to 4 cycles. Although primary PD and secondary clinical endpoints 
were met, the primary endpoint cannot be accepted to show therapeutic equivalence directly. The totality of 
evidence is considered to support therapeutic equivalence of IV and SC formulations of efgartigimod. 
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In the following assessment the two studies ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-2002 as well as SC pooling block 
will be used as the main clinical safety database. The phase 1 studies will be used as supportive safety data 
and  will  be  included  where  considered  appropriate.  The  IV  studies  and  IV  pooling  block  will  be  used  for 
comparisons to identify any clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile between efgartigimod alfa IV 
and efgartigimod PH20 SC and to support the long-term safety of efgartigimod PH20 SC. 
Studies ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-2002 
In ARGX-113-2001, in the overall population (including AChR-Ab seropositive and negative participants), 111 
participants were enrolled and randomized to receive the investigational medical product: 55 participants in 
the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and 56 participants in the efgartigimod IV arm. One participant was randomized 
to the efgartigimod IV arm but did not receive efgartigimod because of an adverse event (AE) of Pyrexia.  
Overall,  104  (94.5%)  participants  received  all  4  efgartigimod  doses.  In  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  arm,  49 
(89.1%) participants received all 4 doses. In the efgartigimod IV arm, 55 (100%) participants received all 4 
doses. 
A total of 178 participants rolled over to ARGX-113-2002 from ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-1705. Of these, 
53 participants received efgartigimod PH20 SC in ARGX-113-2001, 52 participants received efgartigimod IV in 
ARGX-113-2001,  and  73  participants  received  efgartigimod  IV  in  ARGX-113-1705.  Of  the  178  participants 
enrolled, 164 have received efgartigimod PH20 SC in the study and are defined as the total group. As of the 
data cutoff date, most participants (97.6%) were ongoing in the study. As of the data cutoff date, 2 participants 
with fatal serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded as ongoing.  
The  mean  (SD)  study  duration  was  169.7  (58.82)  days.  The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  all  cycles  combined 
(excluding the period before the first administration of efgartigimod PH20 SC in ARGX-113-2002) was 160.6 
Assessment report

(60.17) days, resulting in 72.1 patient-years of follow-up. As of the data cutoff date, the median cycle durations 
ranged from 50.0 to 56.0 days. 
Pooling blocks 
In support of the application for efgartigimod PH20 SC for the treatment of gMG, participant safety data were 
grouped into an SC PB and an IV PB: 
o  SC PB: The efgartigimod SC PB comprises data from all participants with gMG treated with efgartigimod 
coformulated  with  rHuPH20  for  SC  administration  (efgartigimod  PH20  SC)  in  ARGX-113-2001  and 
ARGX-113-2002 (through the safety data cutoff date of 02 Mar 2022). 
o 
IV PB: The efgartigimod IV PB comprises data from participants with gMG treated with efgartigimod for 
IV administration (efgartigimod IV) in ARGX-113-1602, ARGX-113-1704, and ARGX-113-1705-IA4.

a An AESI was defined as any AE in the MedDRA SOC Infections and infestations. 
B  IRRs  were  defined  as  AEs  in  the  SMQ  (broad)  for  Hypersensitivity,  Anaphylactic  reaction,  and  Extravasation  (excluding  implants)  that 
occurred within 48  
hours of an injection or infusion, or within 2 days of the event if no start time was available. 
c  Localized  ISRs  were  defined  as  adverse  events  with  MedDRA  high  level  term  Injection  site  reactions  regardless  of  the  time  of  AE  onset 
relative to an injection. There is overlap in the PTs for localized Injection site reactions by high level term (refer to Section 2.1.5.2) and the 
SMQs for the injection- or infusion-related reactions. In study ARGX-113-2001, the AE of Injection site haematoma was incorrectly coded. It 
should have been coded as a Catheter site reaction. There were no AEs by PT of Injection site reactions in the efgartigimod IV arm 
In study ARGX-113-2001, there were reported more AEs (67.3% vs. 50.9%), SAEs (14.5% vs 7.3%), Grade 3 
or higher AEs (16.4% vs. 7.3%), Treatment related AEs (43.6% vs. 21.8%) and Procedure related AEs (25.5% 
vs.  3.6%)  in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  compared  to  the  efgartigimod  IV  arm.  The  higher  incidence  of  AEs, 
treatment- and  procedure-related  AEs in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  arm  compared  with  the  efgartigimod  IV 
arm is primarily due to Injection site reactions (38.2% vs. 1.8%).  
AESIs were well balanced between the efgartigimod PH20 SC and IV arms (18.2% vs. 16.4%). No treatment 
related SAEs or fatal AEs were reported in both arms. 1 (1.8%) AE for which the study drug was interrupted 
and 2 (3.6%) AEs for which the study drug was discontinued were reported in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm 
and none in the efgartigimod IV arm.  
Analysis of the total group in ARGX-113-2002, which provides prolonged exposure to efgartigimod PH20 SC, 
show more reported AEs compared to the SC arm in study ARGX-113-2001 (76,2% vs. 67.3%). The higher 
frequency of injection site reactions contributes to this (42.2% vs. 38.2%). AESI were also higher in the total 
group in ARGX-113-2002 compared to the SC arm in study ARGX-113-2001 (29.3% vs. 18.2%), this will be 
assessed in the relevant section. To fatal cases were reported in the total group in study which will be assessed 
in the relevant section. No additional safety issues are observed with prolonged and repeated administration 
of efgartigimod PH20 SC.

2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Two  fatal  cases  were  reported  in  participants  with  gMG  who  received  efgartigimod  PH20  SC;  both  events 
occurred during ARGX-113-2002:  
• 
One participant with a history of renal cancer with no evidence of reoccurrence for >3 years at screening 
died because of an SAE of Renal cancer metastatic: 
The  participant  was  diagnosed  with  myasthenia  gravis  in  2017.  Other  medical  history  included  renal  cell 
carcinoma.  At  the  time  of  the  SAE  of  renal  cancer  metastatic  in  study  ARGX-113-2002,  the  participant  had 
received  4  doses  and  completed  1  period  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  1000  mg  in  study  ARGX-113-2002.  The 
participant died due to renal cancer metastatic, and the cause of death was reported as cardiac arrest. The SAE 
of renal cancer metastatic was determined by the investigator to be not related to efgartigimod or other study 
procedures. 
• 
One participant for whom COVID-19 vaccination status was not reported in the medical history died 
because of SAEs of COVID-19 and Respiratory failure.  
The participant was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in 2016. At the time of the SAE of COVID-19 and SAE 
of respiratory failure, the participant had received 24 doses and completed 6 cycles of efgartigimod IV in study 
Assessment report

ARGX-113-1705 and had received 12 doses and completed 3 cycles of efgartigimod PH20 SC in the extension 
study  (ARGX-113-2002)  .  The  participant  died  on  an  unspecified  date  in  February  2022  due  to  SAE  of 
respiratory failure and SAE of COVID-19. These events were considered by the investigator to be not related 
to  efgartigimod.  As  alternative  causes,  this  was  an  elderly  participant  with  important  cardiovascular  and 
metabolic concomitant conditions.

efgartigimod IV arm in study ARGX-113-2001. The most commonly reported SAE (≥5% of participants) was 
Myasthenia gravis which occurred in 5 (9.1%) participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and in 1 (1.8%) 
participant  in  the  efgartigimod  IV  arm  and  thus  contributed  to  the  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  SC  arm. 
None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to efgartigimod.  
In study ARGX-113-2002, SAEs occurred in 17 (10.4%) participants in the total group. The most commonly 
reported  SAEs  (≥2  participants)  were  Myasthenia  gravis  (6  [3.7%])  participants),  COVID-19  (3  [1.8%] 
participants), and Respiratory failure (2 [1.2%] participants). 1 SAE, a grade 3 Myasthenia gravis crisis event

high level term (refer to Section 2.1.5.2) and the SMQs for the injection- or infusion-related reactions.  
a Injection-related reactions were defined as AEs in the SMQ (broad) for Hypersensitivity, Anaphylactic reaction, and Extravasation (excluding 
implants) that occurred within 48 hours of an injection or infusion, or within 2 days of the event if no start time was available.  
b The PT term of Infusion site rash will be corrected to Injection site rash in a subsequent database update. 
65  (38.7%)  participants  had  injection-related  reactions.  Most  injection-related  reactions  were  localized 
Injection site reactions. All injection-related reactions were CTCAE grades 1 or 2, none were serious and there 
were no treatment discontinuations because of injection-related reactions. 
The most commonly occurring injection-related reactions were Injection site erythema (24.4%), Injection site 
pain  (7.7%),  Injection  site  rash  (6.5%),  and  Injection  site  swelling  (5.4%).  This  is  expected  in  an  SC 
administered antibody. 
IV Pooling Block  
In the total efgartigimod group 18 (11.0%) participants had Infusion-related reaction. One (0.6%) participant 
had  an  infusion-related  reaction  that  was  serious  (PT:  Infusion-related  reaction).  No  participants  had  an 
Infusion-related reaction that was CTCAE grade ≥3.  
No  Anaphylactic  reactions  or  severe  cases  of  Hypersensitivity  occurred.  Excluding  localized  Injection  site 
reactions, AEs potentially associated with Hypersensitivity included Rash (4 [2.4%] participants); Cough and 
Rash maculo-papular (2 [1.2%] participants each).

AEs of Myasthenia Gravis 
Events in Study ARGX-113-2001  
In study ARGX-113-2001, 6 (10.9%) participants treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC and 1 (1.8%) participant 
treated with efgartigimod IV reported AEs of Myasthenia gravis. Overall, Myasthenia gravis was reported in 10 
(6.0%) participants in the SC polling block and 8 (4.9%) participants in the IV pooling block. In the initial MAA 
for the IV formulation, Myasthenia gravis occurred with similar frequency in the efgartigimod arm and placebo 
arm and was therefore not considered related to efgartigimod. Further, myasthenia gravis crisis is a known risk 
associated with myasthenia gravis with a reported incidence of 15-20% of myasthenic patients experiencing 
myasthenic crisis at least once in their lives.  
The 5 out of 6 events related to SC formulation occurred during the 7-week posttreatment follow-up period. 2 
out of 6 receiving SC formulation had a bodyweight >90 kg. However, those 2 participants had events that are 
known  triggers  for  MG  exacerbations:  administration  of  high  dose  steroids  and  infection,  which  correlated 
temporally with their MG exacerbation. Body weight related to SAEs is further discussed in the relevant section. 
4 participants had moderate to severe gMG (MGFA Class III or IV) at screening.

Suicidality Assessment 
A prospective assessment for suicidal ideation and behavior was included in ARGX-113-1602, ARGX-113-1704, 
ARGX-113-1705, ARGX-113-2001, and ARGX-113-2002. This suicidality assessment was made by asking the 
participant the following question from the PHQ-9: “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered 
by thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way?” 
The suicidality assessment is in line with the suicidality assessment from the initial MAA for the IV formulation 
and does not raise any concerns regarding efgartigimod SC.

Age 
Review of Demographic and baseline disease characteristics by age showed that the majority of participants 
were 18 to <65 years and were female (78.6%). The mean (SD) time since diagnosis was longer in the 18 to 
<65 years category (9.39 [8.646] years), than the ≥65 years category (6.12 [4.345] years). The percentage 
of participants who received concomitant treatment for gMG at baseline with NSIDs and steroids was higher in 
the 18 to <65 years category (41.7%) than the ≥65 years category (27.8%). The majority of participant had 
normal renal function in the 18 to <65 years category (90.2%) and mild renal impairment in the ≥65 years 
category (63.9%).

Two  deaths  occurred  in  participants  ≥65  years;  however,  for  both  participants,  the  cause  of  death  was  not 
considered by the investigator to be related to efgartigimod.

Body Weight 
Baseline body weight ranged from 42.0 to 150.2 kg for participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm of ARGX-
113-2001. 
Post  hoc  analyses  were  performed  for  AEs  by  baseline  weight  of  participants  in  the  SC  PB.  No  clinically 
meaningful differences in the safety profiles of efgartigimod PH20 SC were identified across the baseline body 
weight categories (ie, <50 kg, ≥50 to <75 kg, ≥75 to <100 kg, ≥100 to <125 kg, or ≥125 kg). The frequency 
of grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs in the ≥100 to <125 kg body weight category was higher than in the other weight 
categories; however, there were a small number of participants in each body weight category.  
Myasthenia gravis exacerbation was reported in three patients in the ≥100 to <125 kg body weight category.

Hepatic Impairment 
There have been no clinical studies of efgartigimod in participants with hepatic impairment, and the safety of 
efgartigimod in this population is unknown. 
Although allowed per study inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants with hepatic impairment have not been 
enrolled in an efgartigimod clinical study. Therefore, no clinical data in participants with hepatic impairment 
are  available.  The  impact  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  PK  and  PD  of  efgartigimod  has  not  been  studied; 
however, it unlikely that a dose adjustment is needed for participants with hepatic impairment. 
Markers of hepatic function were evaluated as potential covariates in the population PK/PD analysis. Albumin, 
total bilirubin, AST, ALP, and ALT did not influence any of the model parameters in the final population PK/PD 
model. 
Renal Impairment 
The overall safety profile was similar between participants with normal renal function and those with mild renal 
impairment  (Table  51).  The  frequency  of  participants  with  SAEs,  AEs  grade  ≥3,  and  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation was higher in participants with mild renal impairment than those with normal renal function.

Impact of Retreatment on ADA Against Efgartigimod  
In general, in the integrated analysis, the highest ADA incidence was observed in the first treatment cycle. The 
ADA  incidence  in  participants  who  had  at  least  3  treatment  cycles  (ie,  cohort  3;  n=44)  was  17  (38.6%),  6 
(15.0%), and 3 (9.4%) in cycles 1, 2, and 3, respectively (table below). The cumulative ADA incidence over 
cycles 1 to 3 was 17 (38.6%). There were no additional participants classified as ADA positive during cycles 2 
or  3  compared  to  cycle  1.  Moreover,  the  number  of  participants  classified  as  positive  for  ADA  decreased  in 
subsequent cycles, indicating that many of the ADA responses are transient.  
NAb  were  detected  during  the  first  cycle  and  not  during  subsequent  cycles  for  the  2  participants  who  were 
classified as NAb positive.

Impact of ADA Against Efgartigimod on Safety 
In both the efgartigimod PH20 SC and the efgartigimod IV arms, there was no apparent difference observed in 
the overall safety profile (AE or SAE) between the ADA negative participants and participants with treatment-
induced, treatment-boosted, or treatment-unaffected ADA against efgartigimod. 
Overall, AEs were reported in 37 (67.3%) participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm. These AEs occurred 
in  63.3%  (19)  of  participants  who  were  ADA  negative,  83.3%  (5)  of  participants  with  treatment-unaffected 
ADA, 66.7% (12) of participants with treatment-induced ADA, and 100% (1) of participants with treatment-
boosted ADA. 
AEs were reported in 28 (50.9%) participants in the efgartigimod IV arm. These AEs occurred in 47.5% (19) 
of  ADA-negative  participants  and  in  50.0%  (2),  60.0%  (6),  and  100%  (1)  of  participants  with  treatment-
unaffected, treatment-induced, and treatment-boosted ADA, respectively. 
SAEs were reported in 8 (14.5%) participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm. These SAEs occurred in 16.7% 
(5)  of  ADA-negative  participants  and  in  16.7%  (1),  11.1%  (2),  and  0%  (0)  of  participants  with  treatment-
unaffected, treatment-induced, and treatment-boosted ADA, respectively. 
Overall, there was no apparent impact of ADA and NAb against efgartigimod on safety observed in either the 
efgartigimod PH20 SC arm or the efgartigimod IV arm; however, the data should be interpreted with caution 
given the limitations of this study (ie, small sample size and short study duration). 
Prevalence and Incidence of Ab Against rHuPH20

Impact of Ab Against rHuPH20 on Efgartigimod PH20 SC Safety  
There was no apparent difference observed in the overall safety profile (AE or SAE) between the participants 
negative for Ab against rHuPH20 participants and participants with treatment-induced, treatment-boosted, or 
treatment-unaffected Ab against rHuPH20. 
During a post hoc analysis, injection site reactions were observed in 21 (38.2%) participants in the efgartigimod 
PH20  SC  arm.  These  injection  site  reactions  occurred  in  18  (38.3%)  participants  who  were  negative  for  Ab 
against rHuPH20 and in 3 (60.0%) participants with treatment-unaffected Ab against rHuPH20. There were no 
injection site reactions in participants with treatment-induced or treatment-boosted Ab against rHuPH20. 
Overall, there was no observed apparent impact of Ab against rHuPH20 on the safety of efgartigimod PH20 SC.

2.5.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Clinical drug interactions studies have not been performed with efgartigimod. 
Efgartigimod  may  potentially  affect  the  PK  and/or  PD  of  compounds  that  bind  to  the  human  FcRn  (ie, 
immunoglobulin products, monoclonal antibodies, or antibody derivatives containing the human Fc domain of 
the IgG subclass). 
Participants with gMG included in the phase 3 clinical development program were required to be on a stable 
dose of their concomitant MG therapy before screening, limited to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, steroids, and 
NSIDs. NSIDs or steroids were allowed during the clinical studies in participants with gMG and were extensively 
used in the study populations; therefore, any potential interaction is accounted for in the safety profile. The 
effect of MG concomitant treatment of steroids and/or NSIDs was evaluated by means of covariate testing in 
the  population  PK/PD  analysis.  Although  this  covariate  was  statistically  significant  in  the  model,  it  was  not 
considered to be clinically relevant. 
In ARGX-113-2001, PLEX, Ig therapy (IVIg and SCIg), immunoadsorption, or a change in dosage or type of 
corticosteroid were prohibited. If specific protocol-defined criteria were met, these therapies were considered 
rescue  therapy  and  could  be  used,  but  resulted  in  IMP  discontinuation  in  ARGX-113-2001.  The  participants 
could  roll  over  to  ARGX-113-2002.  Throughout  ARGX-113-2002,  treatment  with  PLEX,  Ig  therapy,  or 
immunoadsorption (as a combination or monotherapy) was permitted as rescue therapy a maximum of 3 times 
per year, if it was not for a life-threatening condition and protocol-defined criteria were met.

Clinical  studies  to  investigate  a  possible  interaction  between  rHuPH20  and  efgartigimod  have  not  been 
performed. SC-administered rHuPH20 is merely used to increase the dispersion and absorption of other injected 
drugs (ie, efgartigimod when administered as efgartigimod PH20 SC). SC-administered rHuPH20 is transiently 
acting and is not measurable in circulation at clinically relevant doses. It has been demonstrated to exert no 
long-term local effects. rHuPH20 has a half-life in the skin of less than 30 minutes. 
Vaccination 
In ARGX-113-2001 (efgartigimod PH20 SC and efgartigimod IV study) and ARGX-113-2002 (efgartigimod PH20 
SC  study),  participants  were  allowed  to  receive  vaccines  that  did  not  use  live  or  live-attenuated  biological 
material. Any inactivated subunit, polysaccharide,  or conjugate vaccine was allowed at the discretion of the 
investigator  and  when  administered  at  least  48  hours  predose  or  48  hours  postdose  of  efgartigimod 
administration. In ARGX-113-1704 and ARGX-113-1705 (efgartigimod IV studies), vaccination of participants 
with live or live-attenuated vaccines was prohibited within 4 weeks of study entry, and vaccination with other 
vaccines was permitted 48 hours before or after an infusion. 
As described in the gMG IV submission, no clinically relevant effect on PK and PD of therapeutic antibodies is 
expected when an antibody is given ≥2 weeks after the last efgartigimod PH20 SC injection. 
The  safety  of  immunization  with  live  or  live-attenuated  vaccines  and  the  response  to  immunization  with 
vaccines  are  unknown.  It  is  recommended  to  administer  all  vaccines  according  to  national  immunization 
guidelines and at least 4 weeks before initiation of treatment with efgartigimod. For participants who are being 
treated with efgartigimod, vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended. For all other 
vaccines, vaccination should take place at least 2 weeks after the last administration of a treatment cycle and 
4 weeks before initiating the next treatment cycle.

2.5.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
As of 31 Mar 2022, approximately 273 patients with gMG in the US have been treated with efgartigimod IV. 
As of 31 Mar 2022, 72 ICSRs containing 187 events have been received for patients with gMG who were treated 
with  efgartigimod  IV.  Of  these  ICSRs,  44  (23.5%)  were  solicited  reports  (from  market  research  or  patient 
support  programs),  17  (9.1%)  were  spontaneously  reported,  and  11  (5.9%)  were  received  from  expanded 
access programs. A total of 33 patients were male and 33 patients were female (3 were unreported and 3 were 
unknown). The mean age was 61.5 years (range: 18-92 years; age was not reported for 17% of the patients). 
Of the 187 events reported, 16 (8.6%) were serious (table below; all assessed as unlisted) and 171 (91.4%) 
were nonserious. Of the nonserious cases, 155 (90.6%) were unlisted and 16 (9.4%) were listed. Commonly 
reported AEs (≥3% by event count) included Fatigue (7%), Dyspnoea (4.8%), Headache (3.2%), and Diplopia 
(3.2%). 
There  were  3  fatal  cases  reported  (all  spontaneous)  with  a  mean  age  of  73.3  years  (range:  68-79  years). 
Limited  information  was  available  for  the  fatal  cases,  including  the  cause  of  death;  therefore,  no  clinically 
meaningful conclusion can be drawn. 
Overall,  the  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with  the  manifestation  of  the  underlying  MG  disease  or  with  the 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) described in the current efgartigimod IV USPI.

2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data 
The clinical safety database is based on three Phase 1 studies in healthy participants receiving efgartigimod SC 
with  and  without  rHuPH20  (ARGX-113-1702,  ARGX-113-1901  and  ARGX-113-1907),  two  clinical  studies  in 
participants  with gMG receiving efgartigimod  PH20  SC (ARGX-113-2001  and ARGX-113-2002) and 3 clinical

studies in participants with gMG receiving efgartigimod IV (ARGX-113-1602, ARGX-113-1704 and ARGX-113-
1705). The safety database was grouped into two pooling blocks (SC and IV pooling block). The two studies 
ARGX-113-2001 and ARGX-113-2002 as well as SC pooling block is used as the main clinical safety database. 
The IV studies and IV pooling block is used for comparisons to identify any clinically meaningful differences in 
the safety profile between efgartigimod alfa IV and efgartigimod PH20 SC and to support the long-term safety 
of efgartigimod PH20 SC. The MAH has presented the safety data for the overall population in the summary of 
clinical safety, including AChR-Ab seropositive and AChR-Ab seronegative participants, and states that the two 
populations safety profile and baseline characteristics are similar. The similar safety profile has been confirmed 
after the MAH presented the overall safety data on AChR-Ab seropositive patients and AChR-Ab seronegative 
patients side by side. 
Study ARGX-113-2001: in the overall population (including AChR-Ab seropositive and negative participants), 
55  participants  were  enrolled  in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  arm  and  56  participants  were  enrolled  in  the 
efgartigimod IV arm (one patient didn’t receive efgartigimod IV due to pyrexia). In the efgartigimod PH20 SC 
arm, 49 (89.1%) participants received all 4 doses. In the efgartigimod IV arm, 55 (100%) participants received 
all  4  doses.  The  MAH  presented  the  reasons  for  the  missing  doses  in  the  6  participants  in  the  efgartigimod 
PH20  SC  arm.  3  participants  had  AEs  (Covid-19  infection,  myasthenia  gravis  and  Injection  site  rash),  1 
participant  discontinued  the  study  for  personal  reasons,  1  participant  did  not  attend  a  visit  for  an  unknown 
reason, and 1 participant was outside of the time window for administration.  
Study ARGX-113-2002: A total of 178 participants rolled over to ARGX-113-2002 from ARGX-113-2001 and 
ARGX-113-1705. Of the 178 participants enrolled, 164 have received efgartigimod PH20 SC in the study and 
are  defined  as  the  total  group.  14  of  the  178  participants  who  rolled  over  to  study  ARGX-113-2002  did  not 
receive efgartigimod PH20 SC at the time of the first interim analysis. Of these 14 participants, 3 participants 
discontinued the study (due to withdrawal of consent, lack of efficacy and screen failure). The 11 remaining 
participants had not yet received treatment according to the protocol. 
SC pooling block: 168 participants received at least 1 dose of efgartigimod PH20 SC, including 55 in the “SC 
2001”  group  and  113  in  the  “total  IV”  group,  who  rolled  over  from  ARGX-113-2001  or  ARGX-113-1705  to 
ARGX-113-2002. 
A maximum of 6 cycles were started in participants in the SC PB: 168 (100%) participants with 1 cycle, 149 
(88.7%) with 2 cycles, 117 (69.6%) with 3 cycles; 80 (47.6%) with 4 cycles, 38 (22.6%) with 5 cycles, and 8 
(4.8%) with 6 cycles. A maximum of 5 cycles were completed in participants in the SC PB.  
Overall, the duration of treatment combined with follow-up, for the total group, was at least 6 months for 104 
(61.9%) participants. The mean (SD) duration of treatment combined with follow-up was 183.5 (67.25) days 
for the total group. The cumulative duration of treatment exposure was 84.4 total participant-years. There are 
no safety data on the efgartigimod PH20 SC for more than 12 months.  
IV  Pooling  Block:  A  total  of  164  participants  received  at  least  1  dose  of  efgartigimod  IV.  A  maximum  of  19 
cycles were started in participants in the IV PB. The mean (SD) duration of treatment combined with follow-up 
was  592.5  (291.86)  days  in  the  total  efgartigimod  group.  Overall,  the  duration  of  treatment  combined  with 
follow-up was at least 12 months for 125 (76.2%) participants, at least 18 months for 105 (64.0%) participants, 
and at least 24 months for 63 (38.4%) participants. 
Overall, the main safety database consisted of a total of 104 gMG patients treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC 
for at least 6 months and none patients treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC is for at least 12 months. To support 
the long-term safety of efgartigimod PH20 SC, the application relies on safety data from the efgartigimod PH20 
SC, with support from safety data in the efgartigimod alfa IV, which is considered acceptable since the patient 
Assessment report

population and active substance is the same. The efgartigimod alfa IV safety data adds 125 participants with 
at  least  12-month  exposure  and  63  participants  with  at  least  24  months  exposure.  There  are  limited  data 
available  on  the  use  of  efgartigimod  beyond  2  years.  As  efgartigimod  is  intended  to  be  used  as  a  chronic 
therapy, long-term safety is included in the risk management plan (RMP) as missing information and further 
data will be collected on the safety of long-term treatment.  
Adverse events 
In study ARGX-113-2001, there were reported more AEs (67.3% vs. 50.9%), SAEs (14.5% vs 7.3%), Grade 3 
or higher AEs (16.4% vs. 7.3%), Treatment related AEs (43.6% vs. 21.8%) and Procedure related AEs (25.5% 
vs.  3.6%)  in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  compared  to  the  efgartigimod  IV  arm.  Injection  site  reactions 
contributed to the higher frequency in the SC arm. In the extension study ARGX-113-2002, the reported AEs 
increased, probably due to longer exposure. However, when looking at the SC Pooling Block the frequency of 
participants  with ≥1 AE in the total  group decreased with each subsequent  cycle. The frequencies in  the IV 
pooling block is higher than in the SC pooling block, probably due to the longer exposure.  
In study ARGX-113-2001, the most common reported AEs were Injection site rash (8 [14.5%] participants in 
the SC arm vs. 0 in the IV arm), Headache (7 [12.7%] participants each in both arms), Injection site erythema 
(7 [12.7%] participants in the SC arm and 0 in the IV arm), myasthenia gravis (6 [10.9%] participants in the 
SC  arm  and  1  [1.8%]  in  the  IV  arm).  The  MAH  has  added  injection  site  reactions  with  the  frequency  “very 
common” to the ADR table in the SmPC section 4.8. This is endorsed.  
In ARGX-113-2002, the most commonly reported AEs in were Injection site erythema, Headache, COVID-19, 
Injection  site  pain,  Injection  site  pruritus,  Injection  site  bruising,  Diarrhoea,  Injection  site  rash, 
Nasopharyngitis, and Injection site swelling. Headache and nasopharyngitis has previously been evaluated in 
the initial application for efgartigimod IV. Both AEs were reported in the same frequencies in the efgartigimod 
and placebo arm in study ARGX-113-1704 and therefore, not considered related to efgartigimod.  
Overall, the type and frequency of commonly AEs were similar between those that occurred in the efgartigimod 
PH20 SC arm in ARGX-113-2001 and in the total group in ARGX-113-2002, except for diarrhoea, which were 
seen more frequently in the total group in ARGX-113-2002 (12 [7.3%] participants in the total group in ARGX-
113-2002 vs. 1 [1.8%] participants in the SC arm in ARGX-113-2001). This is probably due to the longer time 
of exposure, since diarrhoea were seen in the same frequencies in the placebo group in study ARGX-113-1704.  
The frequencies of the ADR table in the SmPC section 4.8 is based on data from the overall population as for 
the IV formulation. It is agreed that the overall gMG population is representative of the safety profile in AChR-
Ab seropositive participants, and it is therefore acceptable to include the total population in the ADR table in 
4.8. 
Serious adverse events and Deaths, other significant events 
Deaths  
Two deaths were reported in participants who received efgartigimod PH20 SC. One participant with a history 
of renal cancer with no evidence of reoccurrence for >3 years at screening died because of an SAE of Renal 
cancer metastatic. One elderly participant with cardiovascular comorbidity died because of SAEs of COVID-19 
and Respiratory failure.  
In  both  cases  the  comorbidities  have  probably  contributed  to  the  outcome  of  death.  However,  efgartigimod 
appears to be associated with a higher risk of infections. Although available data do not seem to indicate an 
increased  risk  of  serious  infections  and  malignancies  with  efgartigimod  over  time  related  to  its 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 153/173 
 
 
immunosuppressive  effects,  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  long-term  exposure  prevents  any  sound 
conclusion on these risks.  
Serious Adverse Events 
8 (14.5%) participants had SAEs in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm compared with 4 (7.3%) participants in the 
efgartigimod IV arm in study ARGX-113-2001. The most commonly reported SAE (≥5% of participants) was 
Myasthenia gravis which occurred in 5 (9.1%) participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and in 1 (1.8%) 
participant  in  the  efgartigimod  IV  arm  and  thus  contributed  to  the  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  SC  arm. 
None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to efgartigimod.  
In study ARGX-113-2002, SAEs occurred in 17 (10.4%) participants in the total group. The most commonly 
reported  SAEs  (≥2  participants)  were  Myasthenia  gravis  (6  [3.7%])  participants),  COVID-19  (3  [1.8%] 
participants), and Respiratory failure (2 [1.2%] participants). 1 SAE, a grade 3 Myasthenia gravis crisis event 
was considered related to efgartigimod PH20 SC.  
Overall, the most frequent reported SAEs were myasthenia gravis and Covid-19. These AEs will be discussed 
further in the relevant sections below. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs occurred in 57 (33.9%) participants in the total group in the SC pooling block. The most frequently AESIs 
were  COVID-19  (12.5%),  Nasopharyngitis  (6.5%),  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (4.2%)  and  Pharyngitis 
(2.4%). 
Serious  AESIs  occurred  in  6  (3.6%)  participants  in  the  total  group.  Serious  AESIs  included  COVID-19  in  3 
(1.8%) participants. Cellulitis, COVID-19 pneumonia, Diarrhoea infectious, Pneumonia, and Rotavirus infection 
were reported in 1 (0.6%) participant each. The 3 severe cases of Covid-19 and the one death due to Covid-
19  could  be  due  to  a  compromised  immune  system  however,  considered  the  Covid-19  pandemic  (high 
frequency) this cannot be confirmed. ‘Serious infections’ are included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
The total number of AESIs were highest in the group of nadir IgG category below the 25th quartile (45.0%) 
and lowest in the group with nadir IgG between the 50th percentile and 75th percentile (25.6%).  The increase 
in  the  number  of  infections  in  the  lowest  IgG  nadir  quartile  is  consistent  with  the  pharmacological  action  of 
efgartigimod.  For  Covid-19,  no  pattern  was  seen  related  to  nadir  IgG  and  equivalent  to  all  other  infections 
except  for  Nasopharyngitis,  which  were  seen  double  as  frequently  in  the  nadir  category  below  the  25th 
percentile compared to the other categories. The MAH states that 3 cases of Nasopharyngitis were assed to be 
related to treatment by the investigator. AEs of Nasopharyngitis were reported more frequently in the placebo 
arm (18.1%) than in the efgartigimod arm (11.9%) in ARGX-113-1704 and there was a similar rate per 100 
PYFU  in  both  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  PB  (15.4  per  100  PYFU)  and  the  efgartigimod  IV  PB  (13.9  per  100 
PYFU), therefore Nasopharyngitis is not included in the ADR table in the SmPC.  
The concomitant use of immunosuppressant treatments for gMG (e.g. steroids or NSIDs, or steroids + NSIDs) 
does not appear to affect the risk of infection. 
In the IV pooling block, 101 (61.6%) participants in the total efgartigimod group had AESIs. The most frequent 
AESIs were Nasopharyngitis (17.1%), Urinary tract infection (11.6%), COVID-19 (11.0%), Upper respiratory 
tract  infection  (7.9%),  Bronchitis  (4.9%),  and  Herpes  zoster  (4.9%).  Herpes  zoster  were  discussed  to  be 
included  in  the  ADR  table  in  the  SmPC  4.8  in  the  initial  MAA  for  efgartigimod  IV.  Due  to  concomitant 
immunosuppressives  in  the  infected  participants  and  literature  to  support  that  FcRn  is  less  likely  associated

with 
increased 
infection  risk  or  opportunistic 
infections  when  compared  with  steroids  or  other 
immunosuppressants, Herpes zoster is not included in the ADR table.  
The total number of AESIs were slightly higher in groups of nadir IgG categories below the median than above 
the median. The small increase in the number of infections in the lowest 2 IgG nadir quartiles are consistent 
with the pharmacological action of efgartigimod. However, there was no temporal relationship between total 
IgG levels and severe infections in the clinical studies with efgartigimod. Based on the safety data reviewed, it 
is  not  considered  necessary  to  monitor  IgG  levels  or  to  change  the  treatment  regimen  based  solely  on  IgG 
levels. 
As shown in the SC pooling block, concomitant use of immunosuppressant treatments for gMG (e.g. steroids 
or NSIDs, or steroids + NSIDs) does not appear to affect the risk of infection. 
Injection- and Infusion-Related Reactions  
In  the  SC  pooling  block,  65  (38.7%)  participants  had  injection-related  reactions.  Most  injection-related 
reactions were localized Injection site reactions. All injection-related reactions were CTCAE grades 1 or 2, none 
were serious and there were no treatment discontinuations because of injection-related reactions. The most 
commonly  occurring  injection-related  reactions  were  Injection  site  erythema  (24.4%),  Injection  site  pain 
(7.7%), Injection site rash (6.5%), and Injection site swelling (5.4%). This is expected in an SC administered 
antibody. A guidance on how to monitor for reactions and handle further treatments if an injection reaction 
occur has been added in the SmPC Section 4.2 and 4.4.  
Further,  a  signal  of  anaphylactic  reaction  has  been  confirmed.  Although  this  is  based  on  data  from  the  IV 
formulation only and it is noted that there are no cases of anaphylactic reaction reported from the development 
programme of the SC formulation, this ADR is also applicable to the SC formulation. The MAH has updated the 
SmPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 accordingly.  
AEs of Myasthenia Gravis 
In study ARGX-113-2001, 6 (10.9%) participants treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC and 1 (1.8%) participant 
treated with efgartigimod IV reported AEs of Myasthenia gravis. Overall, Myasthenia gravis was reported in 10 
(6.0%) participants in the SC polling block and 8 (4.9%) participants in the IV pooling block. In the initial MAA 
for the IV formulation, Myasthenia gravis occurred with similar frequency in the efgartigimod arm and placebo 
arm and was therefore not considered related to efgartigimod. Further, myasthenia gravis crisis is a known risk 
associated with myasthenia gravis with a reported incidence of 15-20% of myasthenic patients experiencing 
myasthenic crisis at least once in their lives.  
The 5 out of 6 events related to SC formulation occurred during the 7-week posttreatment follow-up period. 2 
out of 6 receiving SC formulation had a bodyweight >90 kg. However, those 2 participants had events that are 
known  triggers  for  MG  exacerbations:  administration  of  high  dose  steroids  and  infection,  which  correlated 
temporally with their MG exacerbation. Body weight related to SAEs is further discussed in the relevant section. 
4 participants had moderate to severe gMG (MGFA Class III or IV) at screening.  
In  ARGX-113-2001,  except  for  1  seronegative  participant,  all  participants  who  received  all  4  efgartigimod 
administrations had reduced AChR-Ab levels at week 4 (−41% to −66% of baseline). For  most participants 
who had a Myasthenia gravis AE, AChR-Ab levels started to increase after week 4, with values close to or above 
baseline at the time of the Myasthenia gravis AE. No specific factors (e.g. reduced IgG levels or MG-ADL) were 
identified that could be linked to the events of Myasthenia gravis or Myasthenia gravis crisis. Myasthenia gravis 
AEs  occurred  in  participants  with  more  predisposing  factors  for  MG  worsening  (higher  disease  burden  at 
baseline,  more  bulbar  symptoms,  and  those  with previous  use  of  rescue  therapies).  The  lower  frequency  of

Myasthenia  gravis  AEs  in  study  ARGX-113-2002  indicate  a  lower  frequency  of  Myasthenia  gravis  AEs  with 
treatment  cycles  administered  as  appropriate  per  clinical  evaluation  and  therefore  the  AEs  and  SAEs  of 
myasthenia gravis is not considered to be due to lack of efficacy of SC administrated efgartigimod.  
Laboratory findings 
In study ARGX-113-2001, 5 (4.5%) participants had grade 3 clinical laboratory abnormalities of lymphocyte 
count decreased. Of the 5 participants 1 participant in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm had an AE of Rhinitis. 
The investigator did not consider the event to be related to efgartigimod.  
In  study  ARGX-113-2002,  13  (8.1%)  participants  had  a  clinical  laboratory  abnormality  of  lymphocyte  count 
decreased: grade 3 in 12 (7.5%) participants, and grade 4 in 1 (0.6%) participant. Among them, 2 participants 
also had treatment-related PTs of Lymphocyte count decreased. 2 grade 1 upper respiratory tract infections 
were reported as related to efgartigimod SC administration. This is expected and not concerning as the events 
were grade 1. 
In the IV pooling block, Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported for lymphocyte count decreased in 2 
(1.2%)  participants  and  hypernatremia  in  1  (0.6%)  participant.  None  of  the  AEs  reported  for  these  3 
participants were associated with the grade 4 clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
Grade 3 lymphocyte count decreased were reported in 19 (11.7%) participants. In the initial MAA, the MAH 
has provided data which do not indicate that there should be any relation between patients with ‘Lymphocyte 
count  decreased’  and  infections  or  infestations.  In  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  submission,  no  additional 
participants in the IV PB had grade 3 or 4 lymphocyte count decreased laboratory abnormalities.  
Grade  3  hypertriglyceridemia  were  reported  in  6  (4.1%)  participants  and  grade  3  cholesterol  in  2  (1.4%) 
participants. No cardiovascular relevant AEs were related to the mentioned grade 3 laboratory values. 
In  ARGX-113-1704  cycles  1  and  2,  no  clinically  meaningful  increases  in  mean  laboratory  measurements  of 
triglycerides,  LDL  cholesterol,  or  total  cholesterol  were  found  and  the  changes  were  similar  compared  to 
placebo.  The  same  pattern  was  seen  in  ARGX-113-2001  when  comparing  efgartigimod  IV  and  PH20  SC 
administration.  In  the  efgartigimod  clinical  studies  conducted  to  date,  no  clinically  relevant  mean  increases 
over time in lipids have been observed when compared with placebo.  
The MAH states that the observed increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with other FcRn inhibitors 
were paralleled by a reduction in albumin. Compared with other FcRn inhibitors, efgartigimod mechanistically 
inhibits the IgG-binding portion on FcRn in a manner that is not linked to a reduction in albumin levels and 
consequently does not affect lipid levels. 
Lipid abnormalities are expected in patients with gMG, given the long-term treatment with corticosteroids and 
this is supported by the number of participants in efgartigimod clinical studies with abnormal lipid profiles at 
baseline. No sustained increase in lipid parameters was found after treatment with efgartigimod. The grade 3 
increases seen in the clinical studies can be explained by concomitant corticoid therapy or clinically relevant 
medical history. 
Vital signs 
Overall,  there  were  no  notable  changes  from  baseline  in  vital  sign  parameters  (heart  rate,  systolic  BP,  and 
diastolic BP) in both studies and data were similar to the data shown in the initial MAA. 
ECG abnormalities 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 156/173 
 
 
Severe  abnormalities  in  ECG  evaluations  in  ARGX-113-2001  and  ARGX-113-2002  were  general  low  and  no 
more events were seen compared to the IV arm. 
Suicidality assessment 
The suicidality assessment is in line with the suicidality assessment from the initial MAA for the IV formulation 
and does not raise any concerns regarding efgartigimod SC. 
Safety in special populations 
Age  
More SAE’s, AE of CTCAE severity grade ≥3 and AE leading to discontinuation were seen in participants ≥65 
years than those 18 to <65 years and two deaths occurred in participants ≥65 years. However, treatment-
related AE’s were more frequent in participants 18 to <65 compared to participants ≥65 years. One serious AE 
were reported as treatment-related in the ≥65 year-group. AESIs were similar between the two groups.  
Caution should be taken when interpreting the data due to small subgroups. Further, the elderly may overall 
have a higher frequency of co-morbidities, which will increase the risk of AEs not necessarily related to study 
treatment and overall the safety profile is considered similar in the two age groups.  
Body Weight 
Baseline body weight ranged from 42.0 to 150.2 kg for participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm of ARGX-
113-2001. The frequency of grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs in the two ≥100 kg body weight categories was higher 
than  in  the  other  weight  categories  (36.4%  and  25.0%  for  ≥100  to  <125  kg  and  ≥125  kg  respectively, 
compared to 0% for <50 kg, 10.0% for ≥50 to <75 kg and 15.4% for ≥75 to <100 kg). Further, Myasthenia 
gravis exacerbation was reported in three patients in the ≥100 to <125 kg body weight category.  
The post hoc analyses performed for AEs by baseline weight showed a higher frequency of grade ≥3 AEs and 
SAEs in the 100 to <125 kg body weight category. However, because the number of participants in each body 
weight category was small (n=22 in the 100 to <125 group), caution should be taken in making conclusions. 
Data from the 3 participants, in the ≥100 to <125 kg body weight category, who had AEs of Myasthenia gravis 
show  that  other  clinical  factors  (e.g.  baseline  disease  severity,  concurrent  infection,  SAE  of  Optic  neuritis, 
recent MG exacerbations and the treatment free follow-up period), may have influenced the AEs of Myasthenia 
gravis in these participants.  
The data presented does not raise concerns on the lack of efficacy in obese patients.  
Seropositive and Seronegative 
The MAH states that no trends or patterns were observed between the 2 participant populations that indicate 
a clinically meaningful difference in the safety profiles. The similar safety profile has been confirmed after the 
MAH  presented  the  overall  safety  data  on  AChR-Ab  seropositive  patients  and  seronegative  patients  side  by 
side. 
Hepatic Impairment 
There have been no clinical studies of efgartigimod in participants with hepatic impairment, and the safety of 
efgartigimod in this population is unknown. Due to the nature of the product, an impact of hepatic impairment 
is not expected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 157/173 
 
 
Markers of hepatic function were evaluated as potential covariates in the population PK/PD analysis. Albumin, 
total bilirubin, AST, ALP, and ALT did not influence any of the model parameters in the final population PK/PD 
model. 
Renal Impairment 
There haven’t been any clinical studies of efgartigimod in participants with renal impairment. 
The overall safety profile was similar between participants with normal renal function and those with mild renal 
impairment. The frequency of participants with SAEs, AEs grade ≥3, and AEs leading to discontinuation was 
higher  in  participants  with  mild  renal  impairment  than  those  with  normal  renal  function.  However,  caution 
should be taken due to small numbers in the subgroup (N=35).  
Overall,  it  is  agreed  that  mild  renal  impairment  at  baseline  did  not  affect  the  overall  safety  profile  of 
efgartigimod. Use in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment is included as missing information in 
the RMP.  
Immunological events 
For ADA against efgartigimod, both incidence and prevalence were higher in the efgartigimod SC arm compared 
to the IV arm (Incidence: 34.5% vs. 20.0%, prevalence: 45.5% vs. 27.3%). For Nab against efgartigimod the 
incidence and prevalence were similar (3.6%).  
When looking at the integrated analyses, the highest ADA incidence was observed in the first treatment cycle 
and subsequently lower for each cycle. NAb were detected during the first cycle and not during subsequent 
cycles for the 2 participants who were classified as NAb positive. 
Overall, AEs were reported in 67.3% of participants in the efgartigimod SC arm. These AEs occurred in 63.3% 
(19) of participants who were ADA negative, 83.3% (5) of participants with treatment-unaffected ADA, 66.7% 
(12) of participants with treatment-induced ADA, and 100% (1) of participants with treatment-boosted ADA. 
Injection- or infusion-related reactions that occurred within 48 hours after administration and AEs of Injection 
site reaction that occurred any time after efgartigimod PH20 SC administration were evaluated for correlation 
with ADA against efgartigimod to determine whether these AEs were potentially immune related in ARGX-113-
2001. There was no clear association or temporal relationship between the occurrence of these AEs and the 
presence of ADA against efgartigimod. 
The incidence, and prevalence of Ab against rHuPH20 was 5.5% and 14.5% respectively. The incidence of Ab 
against rHuPH20 increased for each cycle. However, overall the incidence across all cycles were low (14.5%). 
Injection site reactions occurred in 18 (38.3%) participants who were negative for Ab against rHuPH20 and in 
3 (60.0%) participants with treatment-unaffected Ab against rHuPH20. There were no injection site reactions 
in  participants  with  treatment-induced  or  treatment-boosted  Ab  against  rHuPH20.  Most  injection-related 
reactions were localized. All injection-related reactions were CTCAE grades 1 or 2, none were serious and there 
were no treatment discontinuations because of injection-related reactions. 
Overall, the immunogenicity data does not raise any concerns regarding safety, since there was no difference 
in the overall AE and SAE profile between the ADA positive and ADA negative patients and there was no clear 
association or temporal relationship between AEs and ADAs against efgartigimod.  
Drug-drug interactions 
Due to its mode of action, efgartigimod affects the elimination of therapeutic IgGs, including IVIg. Concomitant 
use of these compounds has not been evaluated in any of the clinical studies, since patients who need chronic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 158/173 
 
 
plasmapheresis, PE, IVIg or monoclonal antibodies for controlling symptoms were not allowed in the study. A 
recommendation to postpone initiation of treatment with these products and a precaution to monitor for efficacy 
response is reflected in the SmPC section 4.5. The use of efgartigimod with monoclonal antibodies is included 
in the Risk Management Plan as missing information. 
NSIDs or steroids were allowed and were used in the study populations; therefore, any potential interaction is 
accounted  for  in  the  safety  profile.  Analysis  of  treatment-emergent  AESIs  by  concurrent  treatment  for  gMG 
with  ST,  NSID,  or  ST+NSID  or  without  any  of  these  concomitant  medications  identified  no  meaningful 
differences  between  these  groups  and  hence,  no  clinically  relevant  interactions  related  to  the  safety  of 
efgartigimod and use with stable background therapy allowed in the pivotal trial are identified. 
The  safety  of  immunization  with  live  or  live-attenuated  vaccines  and  the  response  to  immunization  with 
vaccines  are  currently  unknown.  Effect  on  Vaccination  Efficacy  and  the  Use  of  Live/Attenuated  Vaccines  is 
included in the RMP as missing information. 
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
In  ARGX-113-2001,  2  (3.6%)  participants  in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  arm  had  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation. Neither event was considered by the investigator to be related to efgartigimod. There were no 
events leading to treatment discontinuation in the efgartigimod IV arm.  
In ARGX-113-2002, 3 participants discontinued because of AEs. One (0.6%) participant in the IV 1705 group 
had a grade 4 Myasthenia gravis crisis event. The other 2 participants discontinued from the study because of 
fatal SAEs. 
Overall,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuations  were  low.  The  discontinuation  data  does  not  raise  any  new  safety 
concerns. 
Post marketing experience 
Overall, the post-marketing safety data are in line with the known safety profile and what could be expected 
for the treated patient group. No conclusions can be drawn on the serious adverse events and deaths due to 
limited data. No new concerns are raised for efgartigimod alfa IV. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The main safety database consisted of a total of 104 gMG patients treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC for at 
least 6 months and no patients were treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC beyond 12 months. The efgartigimod 
alfa IV safety data adds 125 participants with at least 12-month exposure and 63 participants with at least 24 
months exposure. There are limited data available on the use of efgartigimod beyond 2 years. As efgartigimod 
is intended to be used as a chronic therapy, long-term safety is included in the RMP as missing information and 
further data will be collected on the safety of long-term treatment.  
The  available  safety  data  from  the  clinical  development  program  show  that  efgartigimod  was  generally  well 
tolerated. More AEs were reported in the SC arm compared to the IV arm in study ARGX-113-2001. Injection 
site reactions contributed to the higher frequency in the SC arm. Moreover, in study ARGX-113-2001, more 
patients  in  the  SC  arm  reported  AEs  of  Myasthenia  gravis  compared  to  the  IV  arm.  It  is  plausible,  that  the 
higher frequency could be due to the presence of predisposing factors together with the treatment-free follow 
up period of minimum 7 weeks in the clinical trial and a regular cycling administration likely could lower the 
frequency.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Vyvgart 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion (PL Key safety 
messages section 1,2,4 5 and 6 Design/Layout section 1-6) and Hemlibra 30 mg/mL solution for injection (IFU 
steps 6 thru 17 Pictograms steps 1-28).  The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
Both leaflets share an identical design, layout and writing style. Only differences between the two leaflets are 
due to different content describing different methods of administration and storage conditions. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted 
by the MAH and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
taking into consideration the orphan designation of the product, the small size of the outer carton, and in line 
with previous QRD conclusion applicable to the 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion, the proposed 
request to display the list of excipients in only one of the official EU languages on the multilingual packs of the 
1000 mg solution for injection was deemed acceptable. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be translated 
in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials will only be 
translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Generalized  MG  is  a  rare,  chronic,  neuromuscular  autoimmune  disease  mediated  by  pathogenic  IgG 
autoantibodies,  binding  to  acetylcholine  receptors  or  to  functionally  related  molecules  in  the  postsynaptic 
membrane  at  the  neuromuscular  junction,  which  causes  debilitating  and  potentially  life-threatening  muscle 
weakness. 
MG is considered a model antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, since in most cases the autoantibodies and 
target antigens are well-characterised. MG pathogenesis, its clinical presentation and the response of patients 
to therapy vary depending on the pattern of autoantibodies detected. In general, treatment goals are to treat 
symptoms, to manage myasthenic exacerbations and to achieve minimal manifestation status. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current  treatment  options  include  acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors,  short-term  immune  therapies  such  as 
plasmapheresis  or  IVIG,  and  long-term  immune  therapies  with  immunosuppressive  agents  such  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 164/173 
 
 
corticosteroids,  azathioprine,  cyclosporine,  and  mycophenolate,  but  tacrolimus,  methotrexate,  and 
cyclophosphamide  are  also  used.  Thymectomy  is  also  a  treatment  option.  Monoclonal  antibodies  such  as 
eculizumab or rituximab are used for more refractory cases. Efgartigimod IV and ravulizumab were approved 
in 2022 and this therapeutic area is expanding.   
A  considerable  variation  exists  in  the  management  of  gMG.  There  is  no  consensus  on  the  choice  of 
immunosuppressive  agent  and  widespread  use  of  particular  agents  remains.  With  the  exception  of  AChE 
inhibitors,  azathioprine,  the  complement  inhibitors  eculizumab  and  ravulizumab,  and  the  FcRn  antagonist 
efgartigimod IV which have received regulatory approval for the treatment of gMG subgroups; other therapies 
are  used  off-label.  Some  therapies  are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  serious  side  effects  or  patient 
inconvenience, which may limit their use. 
Patients  with  AChR-Ab  seronegative  gMG  have  greater  limitations  on  approved  treatment  options,  as  AChE 
inhibitors are known to have reduced efficacy or cause worsening in this population and new treatments like 
C5 or FcRn inhibitors are approved only for AChR-Ab seropositive patients. On the other hand, some subgroups 
usually greatly benefit from PLEX in contrast to their reduced response to IVIG, and they have a very good 
response to the administration of rituximab, possibly more pronounced than the other MG subgroups. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To  bridge  the  results  of  the  placebo-controlled  study  ARGX-113-1704  (using  efgartigimod  IV)  to  the  SC 
formulation, a phase 3 PD NI study, ARGX-113-2001, was conducted in participants with gMG. This randomized, 
open-label, parallel-group study evaluated the PD, PK, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profiles 
of efgartigimod PH20 SC 1000 mg and efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg, each administered weekly for a total of 4 
administrations in 1 cycle. After completing ARGX-113-2001, participants had the option to roll over to ARGX-
113-2002. PD NI and clinical endpoints are used to show therapeutic equivalence of SC and IV formulations.  
In ARGX-113-2002, the long-term safety and efficacy of efgartigimod PH20 SC is being evaluated in participants 
who rolled over from either ARGX-113-2001 (in which they may have received efgartigimod IV or efgartigimod 
PH20  SC)  or  ARGX-113-1705  (in  which  all  participants  received  efgartigimod  IV).  Subsequent  cycles  of 
efgartigimod PH20 SC were administered according to clinical evaluation. The frequency of treatment cycles 
may  have  varied  by  participant.  This  application  includes  data  from  the  first  interim  analysis  of  ARGX-113-
2002. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was met in study ARGX-113-2001. The LS mean estimate of the percent change from 
baseline in total IgG level at day 29 was -66.4% (95% CI: -68.91% to -63.86%) in the efgartigimod PH20 SC 
arm and -62.2% (95% CI: -64.66% to -59.71%) in the efgartigimod IV arm after 1 treatment cycle of 4 weekly 
administrations in participants with gMG. The corresponding LS mean difference in the percent change from 
baseline in total IgG levels at day 29 between the 2 arms (efgartigimod IV vs efgartigimod PH20 SC) was -
4.2% (95% CI: -7.73% to -0.66%). Thus, the upper limit of the CI (-0.66%) was below the prespecified non-
inferiority margin of 10%. Results for total IgG levels at day 29 were consistent when analysed for the AChR-
Ab seropositive population in the mITT analysis set. The LS mean estimate of the percent change from baseline 
in total IgG level at day 29 was -66.9% (95% CI: -69.78% to -64.02%) in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and 
-62.4% (95% CI: -65.22% to -59.59%) in the efgartigimod IV arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 165/173 
 
 
Maximum mean percentage decreases in AChR-Ab levels of 62.2% (95% CI: -65.64% to -58.75%) and 59.7% 
(95% CI: -63.19% to -56.15%) were observed one week after the last administration in the efgartigimod SC 
and IV groups, respectively. The difference between arms was -2.5% (95% CI: -7.45% to 2.41).  
For both the efgartigimod alfa SC and IV groups, decrease in total IgG and AChR-Ab levels were associated 
with and preceded a clinical response in AChR-Ab seropositive patients.  
During first treatment cycle in the AChR-Ab seropositive population, the MG-ADL responder criterion (based on 
a reduction of ≥2 points from baseline on the MG-ADL score for ≥4 consecutive weeks) was met in 71.1% and 
71.7% for participants in SC and IV arms, respectively (32 and 33 participants). The maximum reduction in 
MG-ADL total score was at week 4; the mean change from baseline at week 4 was −5.3 (0.42) versus −4.6 
(0.38) ([95% CI: −1.83 to 0.41]) in SC and IV arms, respectively. 
The percentage of QMG responders for the AChR-Ab seropositive population (based on a reduction of ≥3 points 
from baseline on the QMG score for ≥4 consecutive weeks) was 68.9% and 53.3% for participants in SC and 
IV arms, respectively. The maximum reduction in QMG total score was at week 4; the mean QMG change from 
baseline at week 4 was −6.5 (0.70) versus −5.4 (0.53) in SC and IV arms, respectively. 
Sensitivity  analyses  on  the  possible  impact  due  to  treatment  discontinuation,  use  of  excluded  concomitant 
medication or missed doses was done within the estimand frame, using imputation strategies for missing values 
based on missing at random assumption, as well as missing not at random. Based on this, it was concluded 
that the estimated treatment difference was very robust with very little impact due to these intercurrent events. 
In study ARGX-113-2002, in the AChR-Ab seropositive population, the maximum MG-ADL total score reduction 
from cycle baseline decreased with subsequent cycles. The mean (SE) change from study baseline in MG-ADL 
total score in the total group at week 4 in the AChR-Ab seropositive population was −4.1 (0.29) in C1, −4.0 
(0.32) in C2, −4.2 (0.35) in C3, and −4.6 (0.46) in C4. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is important to note that IV formulation has a weight-based dosing (10 mg/kg per infusion) up to 120kg, 
while SC formulation is a fixed dose for all weight ranges. However, weight-PD relationship is not established.   
The primary endpoint cannot be accepted to show therapeutic equivalence of two formulations directly. The 
reduction  of  total  IgG  levels  cannot  be  mechanistically  linked  to  the  disease,  and  the  exposure-response 
relationship  might  be  different  for  pathogenic  antibodies.  AChR-Ab  levels  (pathogenic  IgG)  are  considered 
important for showing therapeutic equivalence in the AChR-Ab seropositive population but is not an approved 
PD biomarker for gMG. 
There are no specific CHMP guidelines for myasthenia gravis therapeutic area or for demonstrating therapeutic 
equivalence in treatment of this population to support the choice of 10% NI margin. However, the issue is not 
pursued further as the data from ARGX-113-2001 is considered sufficiently compelling in terms of efficacy data 
and that requesting a more thorough justification of the relevance of the current NI margin as opposed to other 
choices is not considered of value.  
With a NI margin of 10%-points in total IgG percent reduction, 84% (1–10/62.2×100%) of the PD effect was 
expected to be preserved. The model for NI margin predicted a loss of 3% to 4% clinical efficacy in terms of 
MG-ADL response, with a 10% less decrease in the average AUEC of percent IgG reduction between the baseline 
to week 4.  In the worst-case scenario, on MG-ADL responder rate, the change of 95% CI for the difference of

IV-placebo (20.6% observed in ARGX-113-1704 Study) and the predicted SC-placebo would be around 3%. 
This treatment effect size is considered marginal but acceptable as a lower boundary.   
The percentage of early MG-ADL responders was 62.2% vs 58.7% in the efgartigimod PH20 SC and IV arms, 
respectively.  Early MG-ADL responder is defined as MG-ADL responder with onset of decrease occurring at the 
latest  after  the  second  administration  of  the  IMP.  Despite  being  promising  for  regular  care  of  myasthenic 
patients, efgartigimod is not considered suitable to be used as a rescue treatment for myasthenic crisis, hence 
there is a warning in SmPC informing for treating physicians and class V patients were not enrolled in clinical 
studies. 
Long  term  maintenance  of  effect  for  the  SC  formulation  is  unknown  and  is  not  tested  beyond  first  cycle  of 
treatment  in  a  randomized  controlled  design.  Maintenance  of  the  effect  is  based  on  limited  data  from  IV 
formulation and from study ARGX-113-2002 for up to 4 cycles with SC formulation. The number of patients 
treated are very low in longer term, so there are limitations to the maturity of data. For study ARGX-113-2002, 
exclusion  of  patients  who  did  not  respond  to  efgartigimod  treatment  or  had  life-threatening  events  during 
treatment limits the translation of the results to the future real-life experience. Only MG-ADL scores, not QMG, 
were collected in follow up study. Being aware of the limitations, the data is assessed as supportive evidence 
for maintenance of efficacy beyond first cycle with SC formulation.  
During study ARGX-113-2001, although 54 out of 55 participants in SC arm completed the self-administration/ 
caregiver-supported  administration  training,  only  42  (76.4%)  were  considered  adequately  trained  for  self-
administration  even  after  receiving  up  to  9  training  visits.  Afterwards,  this  situation  did  not  improve  much 
during open label follow up study. Although ARGX-113-2002 is a follow up study and a high dropout rate was 
observed,  still  only  31.3%  of  the  administrations  were  performed  by  the  participants/caregivers  at  home. 
Additional  text  regarding  home  administration  has  been  added  to  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  in  addition  to 
guidance on the method of administration. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In study ARGX-113-2001, there were reported more AEs (67.3% vs. 50.9%), SAEs (14.5% vs 7.3%), Grade 3 
or higher AEs (16.4% vs. 7.3%), Treatment-related AEs (43.6% vs. 21.8%) and Procedure related AEs (25.5% 
vs.  3.6%)  in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  compared  to  the  efgartigimod  IV  arm.  The  higher  incidence  of  AEs, 
treatment-  and  procedure-related  AEs in  the  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  arm  compared  with  the  efgartigimod  IV 
arm is primarily due to injection site reactions (38.2% vs. 1.8%). Most injection-related reactions were localized 
injection site reactions. All injection-related reactions were CTCAE grades 1 or 2, none were serious and there 
were no treatment discontinuations because of injection-related reactions.  
In study ARGX-113-2001, the most common reported AEs were injection site rash (8 [14.5%] participants in 
the SC arm vs. 0 in the IV arm), Headache (7 [12.7%] participants each in both arms), injection site erythema 
(7 [12.7%] participants in the SC arm and 0 in the IV arm) and myasthenia gravis (6 [10.9%] participants in 
the SC arm and 1 [1.8%] in the IV arm). 
8 (14.5%) participants had SAEs in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm compared with 4 (7.3%) participants in the 
efgartigimod IV arm in study ARGX-113-2001. The most commonly reported SAE (≥5% of participants) was 
Myasthenia gravis which occurred in 5 (9.1%) participants in the efgartigimod PH20 SC arm and in 1 (1.8%) 
participant  in  the  efgartigimod  IV  arm  and  thus  contributed  to  the  higher  incidence  of  SAEs  in  the  SC  arm. 
Overall,  Myasthenia  gravis  was  reported  in  10  (6.0%)  participants  in  the  SC  polling  block  and  8  (4.9%) 
participants in the IV pooling block. In the initial MAA for the IV formulation, myasthenia gravis occurred with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 167/173 
 
 
similar  frequency  in  the  efgartigimod  arm  and  placebo  arm  and  was  therefore  not  considered  related  to 
efgartigimod. The 5 out of 6 events related to SC formulation occurred during the 7-week posttreatment follow-
up period. It is considered plausible that higher frequency of myasthenia gravis exacerbations is due to the 
presence  of  predisposing  factors  together  with  the  7-week  treatment  free  follow  up  period.  Therefore,  it  is 
accepted not to include myasthenia Gravis exacerbation to the RMP as an important potential risk for the SC 
formulation. 
The most frequently AESIs were COVID-19 (12.5%), Nasopharyngitis (6.5%), Upper respiratory tract infection 
(4.2%) and Pharyngitis (2.4%) in the SC pooling block. Serious AESIs occurred in 6 (3.6%) participants in the 
total  group.  Serious  AESIs  included  COVID-19  in  3  (1.8%)  participants.  Cellulitis,  COVID-19  pneumonia, 
Diarrhoea infectious, Pneumonia, and Rotavirus infection were reported in 1 (0.6%) participant each. The 3 
severe cases of Covid-19 and the one death due to of Covid-19 could be due to a compromised immune system 
however, considered the Covid-19 pandemic (high frequency) this cannot be confirmed. ‘Serious infections’ are 
included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
For ADA against efgartigimod, both incidence and prevalence were higher in the efgartigimod SC arm compared 
to the IV arm (Incidence: 34.5% vs. 20.0%, prevalence: 45.5% vs. 27.3%). For NAb against efgartigimod the 
incidence and prevalence were similar (3.6%). 
Further,  a  signal  of  anaphylactic  reaction  has  been  confirmed.  Although  this  is  based  on  data  from  the  IV 
formulation only and it is noted that there are no cases of anaphylactic reaction reported from the development 
programme of the SC formulation, this ADR could also be applicable to the SC formulation. 
In conclusion, AEs related to injections site reactions were the most frequently reported adverse event. Overall, 
these were localized and mild. Myasthenia gravis were reported more frequent in participants administered the 
SC formulation compared with the IV formulation and the events were serious. Most events occurred during 
the  7-week  posttreatment  follow  up.  Infections  are  a  known  safety  concern  for  efgartigimod  and  serious 
infections is included in the RMP as an important potential risk.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main safety database consisted of a total of 104 gMG patients treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC for at 
least 6 months and no patients were treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC beyond 12 months. To support the 
long-term  safety  of  efgartigimod  PH20  SC,  the  application  relies  on  short-term  safety  data  from  the 
efgartigimod PH20 SC, with support from safety data in the efgartigimod alfa IV, which is considered acceptable 
since the patient population and active substance is the same. The efgartigimod alfa IV safety data adds 125 
participants with at least 12 months exposure and 63 participants with at least 24 months exposure. There are 
limited data available on the use of efgartigimod beyond 2 years. As efgartigimod is intended to be used as a 
chronic therapy, long-term safety is included in the RMP as missing information and further data will be collected 
on the safety of long-term treatment in a PASS.  
Efgartigimod appears to be associated with a higher risk of infection, which is in accordance with its mechanism 
of  action  as  a  FcRn  antagonist,  which  causes  transient  reduction  in  IgG  levels.  So  far,  during  the  clinical 
development,  the  majority  of  infectious  events  have  been  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  non-serious. 
However, more serious infections, including opportunistic infections, cannot be ruled out when more patients 
are exposed to the drug, especially for long periods. The 3 severe cases of Covid-19 and the one death due to 
of Covid-19 could be due to a compromised immune system however, considered the Covid-19 pandemic (high 
Assessment report

Page 168/173 
 
 
frequency) this cannot be confirmed. ‘Serious infections’ are included in the RMP as an important potential risk 
and will be addressed in a PASS. 
Further missing data includes use in pregnant women, effect on vaccination efficacy and use of live/attenuated 
vaccines, use with monoclonal antibodies, use in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and use 
in immunocompromised patients. These were all discussed during the initial MAA for the IV formulation and 
are also applicable to the SC formulation. They’re all included in the RMP and will be addressed in a PASS.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study  ARGX-113-2001  was  conducted  as  a  confirmatory  trial  and  is  acceptable  for  the  purpose  of  showing 
“therapeutic equivalence” of the two formulations despite some uncertainties discussed below. 
The clinical pharmacology of efgartigimod PH20 SC is documented in  both  healthy participants and  patients 
with  gMG.  The  primary  PD  endpoint  in  studies  ARGX-113-1907  (healthy  subjects)  and  ARGX-113-2001 
(patients  with  gMG)  was  the  percent  reduction  from  baseline  in  total  IgG  levels  at  day  29  (10%-point  NI 
margin). In addition, post hoc analysis of the percent reduction from baseline in AChR-Ab levels at day 29 was 
performed and was supportive of the primary analysis.  
ARGX-113-2001  is  considered  the  main  study  for  this  application  (for  SC  administration),  while  data  from 
ARGX-113-2002 is supportive for maintenance of effect or safety profile after the first cycle. In study ARGX-
113-2001, the most important effects observed are similar percentages of MG-ADL and QMG responders with 
SC  and  IV  formulations  in  AChR-Ab  seropositive  population.  Efficacy  if  IV  formulation  has  previously  been 
demonstrated  for  at  least  2  cycles  in a  double-blind  placebo  controlled  pivotal  study. A  2-point  reduction  in 
MG-ADL total score can be considered as clinically meaningful and this was achieved and maintained for both 
groups in the first cycle. A 3.5-point difference has been shown to correlate with clinically meaningful change 
in QMG and this had been achieved at week 4 but was not maintained until week 10. For a cyclic treatment 
driven by clinical need, the results are considered clinically significant.  
In the light of clinical results, even if the NI margin of 10%-points is not considered directly acceptable, the 
comparable and significant decrease shown on AChR-Ab levels and total IgG levels for the AChR-Ab seropositive 
gMG population is acceptable with the SC formulation. 
It is important to note that the IV formulation has a weight-based dosing (10 mg/kg per infusion) up to 120kg, 
while the SC formulation is a fixed 1000 mg dose for all weight ranges.  
With the caution needed due to the limitations of the safety database, particularly in the long-term, it appears 
that the safety profile of efgartigimod in patients with gMG is manageable. Overall, the main safety database 
consisted  of  a  total  of  104  gMG  patients  treated  with  efgartigimod  PH20  SC  for  at  least  6  months  and  no 
patients were treated with efgartigimod PH20 SC beyond 12 months. The efgartigimod alfa IV safety data adds 
125 participants with at least 12-month exposure and 63 participants with at least 24 months exposure. There 
are limited data available on the use of efgartigimod beyond 2 years. As efgartigimod is intended to be used 
as a chronic therapy, long-term safety is included in the RMP as missing information and further data will be 
collected on the safety of long-term treatment.  
The  available  safety  data  from  the  clinical  development  program  show  that  efgartigimod  was  generally  well 
tolerated. More AEs were reported in the SC arm compared to the IV arm in study ARGX-113-2001. Injection 
site reactions contributed to the higher frequency in the SC arm. Moreover, in study ARGX-113-2001, more 
patients  in  the  SC  arm  reported  AEs  of  Myasthenia  gravis  compared  to  the  IV  arm.  It  is  plausible,  that  the 
higher frequency could be due to the presence of predisposing factors together with the treatment-free follow 
up period of minimum 7 weeks in the clinical trial and a regular cycling administration likely could lower the 
frequency.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443026/2023 
Page 171/173 
 
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, in study ARGX-113-2001, SC and IV efgartigimod formulations (as add-on to standard therapy) have 
demonstrated a similar and clinically relevant efficacy in treatment of AChR-Ab seropositive population in one 
treatment cycle, as rated by patients and physicians and by total IgG reduction at day 29. This was supported 
by results from study ARGX-113-2002 for up to 4 cycles.  
Although primary PD and secondary clinical endpoints were met, the primary endpoint cannot be accepted to 
show therapeutic equivalence directly. The modelling approach is not acceptable as addressed in the PK section, 
however,  the  impact  on  data  used  for  B/R  analysis  is  considered  insignificant.  The  totality  of  evidence  can 
support therapeutic equivalence of IV and SC formulations of efgartigimod. 
The justification of the NI margin, focusing the presentation of all data on AChR-Ab seropositive population, 
investigation  of  any  impact  of  changing  to  fixed  dose  from  weight-based  approach  on  efficacy,  feasibility  of 
self-administration at home, guidance to the physician on selection of patients for switch or timing of switch, 
possibility  to  switch  between  formulations  and  its  potential  impact  on  efficacy  or  immunogenicity  were 
discussed and clarified during the procedure. 
In general, treatment with efgartigimod was well tolerated, with a low incidence of SAEs, severe AEs and AEs 
leading  to  treatment  discontinuation.  Five  deaths  were  reported,  but  none  of  them  were  assessed  by  the 
investigator as related to efgartigimod treatment. Efgartigimod appears to be associated with a higher risk of 
infections, in particular, herpes viral infections and fungal infections. Although available data do not seem to 
indicate  an  increased  risk  of  serious  infections  and  malignancies  with  efgartigimod  over  time  related  to  its 
immunosuppressive  effects,  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  long-term  exposure  prevents  any  sound 
conclusion on these risks.  
The  safety  profile  was  similar  between  the  SC  and  IV  formulation.  However,  some  differences  were  noted; 
more  AEs  were  reported  in  the  SC  arm  compared  to  the  IV  arm  in  study  ARGX-113-2001  due  to  a  higher 
frequency of Injection site reactions in the SC arm. Moreover, in study ARGX-113-2001, more patients in the 
SC arm reported AEs of Myasthenia gravis compared to the IV arm. It is plausible, that the higher frequency 
could  be  due  to  the  presence  of  predisposing  factors  together  with  the  treatment-free  follow  up  period  of 
minimum 7 weeks in the clinical trial and a regular cycling administration likely could lower the frequency.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Vyvgart  SC  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Vyvgart is not similar to Soliris within the meaning of Article 3 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Vyvgart 1000 mg, solution for injection is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Vyvgart  is  indicated  as  an  add  on  to  standard  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with
